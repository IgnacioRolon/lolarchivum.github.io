I am playing like i&rsquo;ve never played this game before to be completely honest. My trades are bad, my shotcalling is retarded, and i end up having more than 10 deaths usually every game, with less than 10 kills. i wasn&rsquo;t like this before. did my MMR spike and i&rsquo;m just playing better people? (this is in norms btw, not ranked. even though i&rsquo;m getting worse in the few ranked games i have played). in terms of ranked, this is my first season playing ranked in league and i hit my highest so far at bronze 2 i think. now i&rsquo;m back at b5 and i don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s gojng to stop until i get to 0 LP. i did try a lot of new champions recently but that shouldn&rsquo;t effect my main THAT much, right?\r\n\r\ni&rsquo;m just truly lost right now, and all these L&rsquo;s are turning me into a noticeably toxic player, and i really really don&rsquo;t want to be toxic. so i need a fix for this. should i legitimately just play one champion and only chat champion for as long as i live? or just what should i do??? \r\n\r\nif anyone can help me that&rsquo;d be greatly appreciated. thanks you!","replies":[{"poster":"kaboomblah","date":"2018-08-05T09:19:09.112+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Dude, you're Bronze.

Find a couple of people online or whatever looking to play some norms and just join in and even if you play bad, you won't feel toxic because you know you're playing just to have fun!! And usually when you play with friends, someone is playing worse than you and you won't stress too much! I'm sorry this is happening to you but sometimes it just happens, I get the same!
