There are two current workarounds:\n\n1. Open the support page in an incognito/private window and follow the process as normal, pressing the login button when prompted.\n\n2. Log out of the website **from the support page**, and then follow the process as normal, pressing login when prompted.\n\nIf your support page has the blank \"OC\" login in the top right, you're good to go. If it only has your summoner icon with \"OCEANIA\" it means the support page is seeing you as logged in on the website and not in support. You need to follow one of the steps above.","replies":[]},{"poster":"badboy503","date":"2018-06-27T08:09:21.033+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"So after browsing the forum it seems alot of other people are having the same problem, 10/10 support system lmao.","replies":[]},{"poster":"LÃ¶st","date":"2018-12-12T11:08:40.338+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"have similar issue, but I cannot see anything at all just blank where it is supposed to give me options. and according to seras im \"good to go\" lol","replies":[]}]}
