I was just going on my personal experience that I've never encountered a(n obvious) cheater. If all they're doing is what is technically possible in-game, then the system probably wouldn't detect it.\n\nNot to say that it's fine to cheat, because it's not, but then you get into the realm of allowing players to customise their game. Like, is allowing players to unlock their camera give them an inherit, and unfair advantage to players who don't? Very bad example, but hopefully my point got across.\n\nIt's a fine line. If they disable the API, then obviously people will get annoyed for legitimate reasons, but leaving the API as it is allows people to make these exploiting programs.\n\nI think the best solution would be to change the API so that champions positions and in-game items aren't technologically visible. That way only programs that can tap into the client themselves to read particular code would still be able to cheat, and they might trigger the client's anti-scripting mechanism in doing so.\n\nRiot members don't hang around the Help & Support boards much, you'll have a much better chance of getting their attention on the Miscellaneous boards. If you could get some evidence of it happening, such as a game-recording that was uploaded to Youtube of the most recent patch (with a very obvious scripter), then something *might* be done about it in the background.\n\nIt's a shame that you seem to run into so many, or it's a shame that I fail to notice all the ones I run into.\n\nBut I gotta say, I like the challenge. What is more satisfying then beating a computer with millisecond reaction times in a reaction-based game?","replies":[]}]}]}]}
