This season me and a friend duo queued our 10 placement matches, I got bronze 4 again, he got bronze 1.. that doesn&#039;t seem to be very fair (since I carried him through, duo bot lane), I had just finished grieving but today when I had to do another placement match because the mmr was &#039;fixed&#039; I was but into games vs bronzes and low silver and it seemed all good. But the thing is that I was place into BRONZE 5 after WINNING the 11th placement match. I won 6/10 = Bronze 4 for me and bronze 1 for friend. then 7/11 = Bronze 5 for me bronze 1 for friend???\r\nIGN: Maskedsora\r\nFriend Ign: Jimny99\r\n Riot please fix this, i&#039;m sad.","replies":[{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2016-11-15T09:03:36.759+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"It sucks, and I can understand your frustration, but you'll need a little context on this.\n\nBasically, upon the release of flex queue, seeding and matchmaking was completely messed up.
