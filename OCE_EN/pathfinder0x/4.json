I'm just running out of reasons mechanically to play him in ranked/serious games now, other than because I love his character. \r\n\r\nVeigar is a single target burst mage but mechanically he's inferior to every assassin and doesn't have anything else in his kit to make him a good pick anymore which goes against Riot's 'champion diversity' design. His instant hard cc was his unique strength, and it needed to be removed to give him counter play and make him healthy, but now there is too much counter play and no real reason to pick him. \r\nSure Veigar can scale infinitely but why pick him when you could take Annie, Syndra, Malz or Viktor and still delete someone late game while simultaneously providing more reliable cc, a nicer early-mid game and more team utility. Veigar only outshines other mid laners when the game gets so late that his ability power is ridiculously overpowered and even then, good players won't let Veigar free farm, will itemize against his mid game (Banshees/QSS) and can still outplay his skill shots/ long delayed spells.\r\n\r\nSo please help me, why mechanically should I play Veigar in a serious match?","replies":[{"poster":"RivenSmurfs","date":"2015-03-09T21:48:06.409+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Im sorry but you just should not play him at the moment.. {{champion:45}} you will be missed {{item:3070}} DAMN YOU RITO >:[","replies":[]},{"poster":"Danasko","date":"2015-03-11T13:04:39.329+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You've said it all, there is basically no reason to go veigar at the moment.
