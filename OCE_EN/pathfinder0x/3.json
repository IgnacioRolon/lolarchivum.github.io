I think it&#039;d be awesome to have the LEDs turn off while the respective ability/summoner spell is on cool down. Other ideas could include flashing all keys red when you&#039;re dead  or having a flashing pattern if you get a pentakill. I guess there are a lot of things that would be possible but I was curious if something similar has been done and if it is legal / you can get banned for it.","replies":[{"poster":"YellowBrickRoad","date":"2016-01-24T06:22:09.648+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"You cant get banned for it so thats a start.\n\nAs for if its possible, depends how deep down the scripting rabbit hole you want to go, you could probably have the word penta kill flash on your keyboard in two parts (flashing penta first and kill right after it) with a bunch of epilepsy happening around it if you wanted, itd just be a matter of coding each individual key to make up the letters and attaching it to a function call that triggers on getting a pentakill.\n\nGranted this means you would need an api for your particular keyboard thats made for league.","replies":[{"poster":"JasonWazza","date":"2016-01-24T06:27:34.631+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"As is said here, you'd need to have an API for the keyboards, because of the simple fact that your CDR effect's cooldowns, and that just makes what your wanting difficult to code.\n\nThat said, you could set it up for some champs, and have it do this based on your full build or something like that, but again, it'd be useless early if you gain any sort of CDR.","replies":[{"poster":"YellowBrickRoad","date":"2016-01-24T06:44:45.971+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"This, granted if you havnt coded before and you find an api just pm me a link to the api and the scripting language for your keyboard and ill whip you up something (directed at op) ive been coding for about 6 years so i can defo sort you out.\n\nGranted i dont have the hardware to test the script real time so even if you find an api there would be a lot of back and forth messages.\n\nI guess one thing you could do is have a bunch of profiles setup that are for each percentage of cdr, but thats overkill, and youd need a separate set of profiles for each champ.","replies":[]}]}]}]}
