His winrate is between 38-40% as of Patch 5.4 and regardless of how healthy, satisfying to play with/against or thematically accurate his kit is if a champion is performing so poorly across the board then he is not in a good state and needs changes. What these changes are exactly is Riot's decision and I believe that they will do it right. But I want to explain his biggest issue to the rest of the community who DON'T think his changes are terrible. \n\nVeigar's offence is fine, in fact is probably healthy that if he can land a difficult stun he has the opportunity to 100-0 burst someone. His ability to defend himself is god damn awful however, for main 4 reasons. Individually these 4 problems are healthy (and often used to create weaknesses on a champion) but when combined they result in a champion that is TOO weak and therefore under performs. Almost any other mid laner can get hyper aggressive against or zone Veigar if they realized how poorly he can defend himself. \n\n1. Single Defensive ability\n\nEvent Horizon is Veigar's only defensive ability and if he misses this (which is currently easy to do) he has nothing but offensive abilities (see number 3). Almost every other champion in the game has either two defensive abilities or does not suffer from number 2, 3 or 4.\n\n2. Low Defensive Reliability\n\nHis defensive ability is very hard to hit (325 Base movespeed champions without boots can avoid easily). Using Dark Matter to put the enemy between a rock and a hard place (E and W) does not solve this problem, Veigar already has mana problems (another debate altogether) and if Veigar has to W + E every time an enemy gets aggressive he will OOM even quicker. \n\n3. Low Offensive Reliability\n\nIf his defensive spell fails he still has two skill shot abilities which can both (W very easily) miss. The saying that offence is the best defence applies to a number of champions who defend themselves by having reliable offence, such that if an enemy is recklessly aggressive they defend themselves by causing reliable (usually point and click) damage. Veigar's Q is somewhat reliable but is still a skillshot and can  miss (especially now through two minions) and his W and E are both unreliable.  \n\n4. Lack of Global/Team utility\n\nVeigar cannot help his team outside of his 1075 (700 + 375) range and his utility is singular. A lot of support champs have utility to make up for a lack of defence but Veigar does not.\n\nLet me give you some examples of mid laners who seem like they are equally as vulnerable as Veigar (often due to a similar lack of mobility) but when their gameplay is broken down they have a kit which is still defensively superior to Veigars. Please note, when I say an ability is unreliable I generally mean it is a skill shot with the chance to miss. I've also excluded all highly mobile mid laners as mobility is already considered to be an extremely effective defensive mechanic. The only other champion that I can think of who is as vulnerable as Veigar is Brand. I'm not sure how Brand survives but I think what makes him slightly more reliable is the type of skill shot (linear) that his stun is along with a form of point and click harass, albeit fairly weak. Not to mention the delay on his Pillar of Flame is 0.625 seconds and the AOE is a large area rather than a thin edge.\n\nKarthus is considered to have a weak lane phase, he only has a single defensive ability (his passive could maybe kinda sorta be considered slightly defensive). However his defensive ability (Wall of Pain) is reliable as it is instant cast (like Veigar's used to be). In fact Wall of Pain and old Event Horizon make for a good comparison. They both were instant cast cc, they both contain an edge area (width) that was approximately the same and were both used to allow them to hit other abilities. Imagine how difficult it would be for Karthus to land it if his wall had a 0.75 second delay. (Yes I realize Karthus' was soft cc I'm just trying to show that a thin skillshot on a high cool down is not effective with a long delay). Additionally Karthus can affect other lanes with his ult which adds a form of global utility for his team (as opposed to Veigar whose identity is single target damage).\n\nAnivia is a low mobility champ who has plenty of defensive abilities (passive, slow, stun, temporary terrain)\n\nAnnie has two defensive spells, her passive and her Molten Shield. She has low global/team utility but has both reliable offence and defence (point and click).\n\nCassiopeia has low mobility but still contains a slow, stun and movement speed buff. While her Twin Fangs are point and click damage. \n\nGalio has a movement speed buff, a slow, a taunt and a 'shield', while his passive provides very reliable defence against AP. \n\nHeimerdinger has only has single defensive ability which is fairly unreliable but can slow or stun. His offence however is very reliable as his turrets lock on and auto attack them selves. Additionally his positioning around his own turrets determines how vulnerable he is (as he is very safe behind 3 turrets).\n\nKayle has both a slow as well as an invulnerability with auto attack (fairly reliable) damage. Her heal and movement speed buff assist her ability to defend herself too. \n\nLux is immobile but has a snare, slow and shield not mention the large range on all of her abilities. While the slow and snare are skill shots her shield always hits her and she has some global presence with her ult to assist outside of her own lane. Orianna is similar to Lux in her high utility. \n\nMalzahar has two forms of cc. He also has reliable (point and click) defensive cc and offensive damage.\n\nMordekaiser is in the process of a rework I think so not sure about his kit but his passive and his Creeping Death are definitely both defensive plus his ult heals him a small amount which might be considered defensive. \n\nSyndra is fairly immobile but has both a stun and a slow. In fact Syndra is similar to Veigar, she has skillshot AOE damage, a stun and a point and click nuke ult. Syndra has had similar problems to Veigar recently with her unreliable stun and therefore defensive problems plaguing her to a low win rate. In fact I thought lessons might have been learned from Syndra's unreliable stun problem but she's on the mend it seems.\n\nTwisted fate. One of the most vulnerable laners due to his single unreliable stun. What has maintained Twisted Fate as a solid champion is his large range (1450 Wild cards) which allow him to farm from a huge distance, plus the global utility his ult provides. In fact Twisted Fate's identity as a champion is global utility (help other lanes) and as such he impacts the game through team work, as opposed to Veigar who's identity is single target burst mage (Riot said this themselves recently with the 5.4 changes). So while his unreliable offence and defence make him weak defensively this does not ruin him as a champion because his ultimate compensates for it.    \n\nVelkoz is one of the defensively weaker champions but still has three forms of CC. His offence is somewhat unreliable (all skillshots) and he doesn't have global utility but the 3 forms of cc make up for it and often put him in bot lane as a support. Additionally Velkoz's lack of LCS cameos shows his defence is somewhat weak and his unreliability leaves too much room for outplay.\n\nViktor has low mobility but his kit includes a movement speed buff, a shield, slow and stun. If his Gravity Field misses, his Q is point and click for both reliable damage trade and reliable defensive mechanics. \n\nXerath has both a slow and stun, albeit both skill shots making them fairly unreliable. Fortunately his massive range (all abilities above 1050) provides some safety while his ultimate gives him extremely high range for some \"global\" utility. Additionally Xerath's identity is a long range mage which means his positioning should generally keep him well out of danger, therefore Xerath has clearly defined strengths and weaknesses. \n\nZiggs is another fairly immobile champion who still contains two defensive abilities with a knock up/back and a slow. His passive gives him point and click frequent damage while his ult gives global utility. \n\nZyra is less frequently being played in mid lane but is still considered to be defensively vulnerable. She has a snare and a slow as well as one of the best disengage ultimates in the game. Her utility has pushed her into support in the last few seasons.\n\nWhile on the topic of supports it is important to note that bot lane is a whole different ball game to mid lane. ADCs are champions which are often weak defensively. This is nullified by the fact that the support acts as their defense. Perhaps Veigar need's to go bot lane with a support. \n\nNow lets look at Veigar one last time. He has a single defensive ability which is unreliable. He has no point and click damage trading abilities (ult is not used for damage trading) and no global ult to help his team. Additionally only one of his spells contains utility and is useful to the rest of the team (which now makes him a poor support). VEIGAR IS SO DEFENSIVELY VULNERABLE. No LCS/Pro/High MMR players are going to pick him because there is far far far too much room to outplay him and avoid his damage with nothing to compensate. This is why he has been ruined by such a seemingly simple change (0.75s delay). \n\nFrom the above we can see there are 4 ways to solve this problem: add 'defensiveness' to another one of his abilities, increase the reliability (significantly I feel) of his only current defensive ability, increase the reliability of offensive damage trading, or provide some sort of global utility which compensates for his weak defence (I feel like this last one would change his identity too much).\n\nNow I trust Riot and I believe that they will eventually put Veigar in a healthy place. There are a million and one ways to do this and there have been heaps of awesome ideas out in the community which could be used. However until Veigar kit is improved defensively he will never be in a good place.","replies":[{"poster":"JasonWazza","date":"2015-03-01T07:24:46.088+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Veigar is dead, they %%%%%ed about no counter-play, but if there is counter-play Veigar becomes the single most useless champion in the game.\n\nThe only thing that used to stop an assassin jumping a Veigar was his E, now that it's delayed, every assassin in the game will reliably kill you by dodging your pathetic little stun.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Knuuckles","date":"2015-03-01T08:53:56.678+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"they are pretty much making assassins obsolete to make way for the 'adc meta'","replies":[]}]}
