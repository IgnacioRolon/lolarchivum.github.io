I was  playing support in one of those games, had all 3 of my wards and a pink up at all times and yet people still got picked off (even when grouped, he would 100-0 someone on the outside of the group). I had exhaust too and he could still 100-0 the carry through exhaust. \r\nWe attempted to CC him but the squishies die in less than a second (according to their death recaps). So my question is what's the counter play to Rengars ult? Were we maybe not doing the above right? Are there specific places to put wards? Sorry I'm not a greater player so hoping someone could help me out.","replies":[{"poster":"GEARSTICK","date":"2015-01-29T12:41:22.155+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"**If you are worried about Rengars and you're playing supp against one then you need a champ that can lock him down or keep him at arms length.**\n\n* {{champion:40}} *Is a good choice, You have a slow, a shield and your tornadoes can knock him up and keep him back. Plus you have the ultimate disengage with your ult.*\n* {{champion:44}} *Can work, you can stun him with E and you also give your team armour passively.*\n* {{champion:12}} *Knock up or headbutt him away (or both). Plus, if he jumps on you your ult will keep you alive.*\n* {{champion:412}} *Can work to, Flay can peel him off your carries as well as your hook. Plus your lantern can get those teammates that get caught away form him, **IF THEY CLICK ON IT** (hint, hint).*\n\n\n**A couple of other choices that I have had work well are..**\n\n\n* {{champion:9}} *His fear was nerfed a while ago but still works well, It forces Rengar to run away from you and your silence can keep his damage down a bit.*\n* {{champion:127}} *I played Liss as support in a few norms last season and her kit is perfect for keeping champs like Rengar, Akali and Kat away from your carries. Plus, your ult is a complete lockdown.*\n\n**A couple of other tips.**\n\n* Either upgrade your {{item:3341}}  as quickly as you can or carry your pink with you. As soon as you see the \"!\" or know he is coming, drop it and force him back.\n\n* **ALWAYS** take {{summoner:3}} this will neuter Rengar and most other burst champs completely.\n\n\n* Try to use smartcast. This will help for instant and click to hit abilities like Taric's stun or Fiddle's fear. Also use it for exhaust, it makes it so much easier.\n\n\n* Stay near your carries and keep grouped. This makes it easier for you to peel and unless you and your team have fed Rengar beyond all help, you can all take him down if he jumps into the group.\n\n\n* **NEVER** fight or chase him in the jungle, **WAY** too many bushes.","replies":[{"poster":"jb3navides","date":"2015-01-31T05:26:23.927+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"***","replies":[{"poster":"GEARSTICK","date":"2015-01-31T14:51:04.001+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thanks, and thanks for pointing out the Taric skill mix up, fixed it now :)\n\nI have brought shame to the supports everywhere for that :P","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"jb3navides","date":"2015-01-29T05:22:17.898+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"***","replies":[{"poster":"Mar3thyu","date":"2015-01-29T06:06:38.272+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=jb3navides,realm=OCE,application-id=FjGAIbRv,discussion-id=eoYuZGT3,comment-id=0002,timestamp=2015-01-29T05:22:17.898+0000)\n>\n> Just dont feed him, its not that hard, he is weak early in terms of everything.\n\nHe has one of the strongest lvl 1s in the game","replies":[{"poster":"jb3navides","date":"2015-01-30T06:23:11.663+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"***","replies":[{"poster":"Mar3thyu","date":"2015-01-30T11:17:33.079+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=jb3navides,realm=OCE,application-id=FjGAIbRv,discussion-id=eoYuZGT3,comment-id=000200000000,timestamp=2015-01-30T06:23:11.663+0000)\n>\n> Not really, it may depend on your champ, but if he is doing the leaping strat just stick near your minions and let him eat minion aggro and trade back as usual.\n\nif you play rengar right you can aa then q for the aa reset","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Mar3thyu","date":"2015-01-29T05:10:29.299+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"surrender @10","replies":[]},{"poster":"Devil God King","date":"2015-01-29T04:42:16.251+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"buy wards","replies":[]}]}
