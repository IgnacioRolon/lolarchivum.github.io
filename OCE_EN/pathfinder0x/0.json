I'm not a PBE player myself and wanted to start a community thread for those who don't know about the changes (See the link) and to provide an alternative solution and get opinions on it.\n\n\nThe biggest issue at the moment seems to be the 0.75 second delay. This change was made to address the \"no counterplay\" issue. I've heard a plethora of PBE players saying that anyone (even Zyra,  lowest base movement speed) without boots or movement speed buffs can easily avoid Event Horizon without thinking about it. This naturally leads to a wide variety of problems for Veigar. \n\n\n\nI have what I think is a better solution as to how to modified his Event Horizon:\n\nIf hit by the perimeter, which is 50 units thick (arbitrary value to explain concept), the enemy champion is slowed by say 90% (arbitrary high value to explain concept). This ensures a situation where mainly only blinks/dashes/spellshields/invulns etc can escape unless your movement is immaculate. Introducing this slow would in fact increase the skill cap for Veigar as the more accurately he can hit the enemy in the middle of a 50 unit thick edge of Event Horizon the harder it is for the enemy to walk out and escape (due to the slow). Then after say 0.75 seconds if they're still touching the 'thick' edge they are stunned, perhaps for 0.75s less than the stun duration. Eg at max rank (2.5s stun duration) the slow lasts 0.75 second while the stun lasts 1.75 seconds. Details and numerical values would obviously need to be tweaked.\n \nReasons I think the above change is more effective than current PBE change while still maintaining Riot's design values (no counterplay):\n \n1: It suggests picking a mobile champion against a Veigar (Which is good because that's his identity and what his weakness should be) as a mobile champ can still dash/blink/invul etc during the slow but non mobile champs have a much harder time dealing with it.\n \n2: It allows Veigar's original play style possible where Event Horizon is used to hit a Dark Matter (during the slow)\n \n3. It provides some counter play as during the slow a player can still escape the subsequent stun. (Even without a dash/blink its just much much harder)\n \n4. It doesn't hurt/nerf his utility/reliability/crowd control as he can still CC (soft CC) on demand which in League of Mobility is needed.\n \n5. It doesn't modify the current use/mastery of ability (players still attempt to hit enemies with the perimeter of Event Horizon to maximise effect and obtain on demand CC) and would increase the mastery of Veigar.\n\n6. Counterplay now requires skill and understanding rather than any old champion just mindlessly walking out of the way.\n\n7. There's a lot of room for Riot to balance this: Edge thickness, slow %, stun delay, stun duration etc. For example they could use the average champion movement speed to calculate that given a 50 unit thickness only the top 10 champions are able to walk out of it if hit directly in the middle.\n\nWhat do you guys think in comparison to the PBE version of Event Horizon?\n","replies":[{"poster":"air tiger","date":"2015-02-27T19:25:53.834+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The delay on the stun is a massive nerf to an already immobile, squishy champ.  My recommendation is the delay on E only applies (and increases) the further away from yourself you cast it.  This way, if a bruiser or assassin jumps you, you can instant E on yourself for an escape.  Yet, if you are trying to stun someone at full range, the delay is in full effect and is therefore much harder to land.  This is just an idea, but I think it's a good one to mitigate how much damage the E nerf has done to his kit and survivability in as a whole.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Dawaraven","date":"2015-02-15T03:10:33.547+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Veigar is cancer keep him as he is.","replies":[{"poster":"spiderboi","date":"2015-02-23T19:20:07.217+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"But he is my cancer.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"spudsrus","date":"2015-02-20T09:29:51.500+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'd like to see some motivation for trapping a champ in your e if they're going to persist with the .75s thing. From the PBE comments he's become very useless. \nCurrently if you miss the e (or someone qss, cleanse, spell shields it) you are fragile like wet paper. \nPossible ideas would be: \n\nYou get AP for killing minions and champions in the E regardless of source. \nKilling a champion in the e grants double ap.\nEnemy champions in the e deal reduced damage to you.\nThe e blocks enemy damage from spells passing through it. (Not all damage but the first x damage, like a sheild combined with a wind wall) can scale off ap\nEnemies moving away from the centre of the e are slowed, the slow increases the closer you are to the centre.\n\nI don't have much hope for him though, feels like it's going the same way as heimer.\n=[","replies":[]},{"poster":"Alzerik","date":"2015-02-19T13:09:59.847+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I have been a Veigar main for almost four years now.  I personally like the changes coming his way.  With a slightly larger range on his E, I feel it helps make up for the .75 sec delay.  Knowing how to play Veigar properly means knowing how to use dark matter in a new way with the E.  For instance, now I will probably drop my dark matter first more often, and then immediately follow up with the stun just on the other side of the champ compared to dark matter.  The W will force them into my stun and will most likely take the dark matter hit as well.  This has already been a way to play Veigar before, but required really fast timing on your W to E, due to the range of it.  With that small range, it will open up a slightly better timing window for the combo.  Lets not forget about the increased range of Q and its ability to penetrate the the first target.  If you are good with skill shots, then your early game has a lot more safe play to it.  You can gain stacks while simultaneously getting strong poke on the enemy.  Not only do we have the improved Q, but we also have the lower CD's on almost all of Veigar's abilities as well.  We also have mana cost reductions which will allow us to use our spells without worrying about that heavy mana cost penalizing us if we miss.  Again, I am very excited about the current changes to Veigar, and can not wait to see what else they might have planned for him.  Just remember to keep an open mind about new ways to play these revised champs.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Marone","date":"2015-02-15T21:09:30.218+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"**Instead of blowing up a prone target, Veigar traps his prey in a chamber of horrors and shoots Baleful Strikes at them and drops Dark Matters where they have limited space to dodge.**  This statement made by Gizmo leads me to think that they see Veigar as a support, not blowing people up but trapping them for others to take advantage of, totally fine with that as I only play Veigar as support.  But as you all know this isn't the reality a lot of the time.  Victims CAN escape, and the wording implies that he can drop not one, but two or more W's and Q's on his victims which isn't possible because of cool downs.\n\nI propose that they upgrade his other skills if they insist on staying with the 0.75 second delay.\n\nQ: Increased width, damage and doesn't stop after two targets when it passes through the edge of the Horizon.\n\nW: Reduced fall time and cool down if cast within the cage.\n\nR: Deals 50% AoE damage based off the damage from the first target.\n\nNew Passive: Remove AP gain from Q and give him 0.25 - 0.75 AP anytime he kills anything, with a small cool down if need be.\n\nThis gives Veigar incentive to cast the cage in such a way that the enemy is inside it when it appears.\n\nIf those seem too brutal what about a change to the way dashes, blinks, pulls and knock backs work while inside the cage: if a dash, blink, knock back or pull would an enemy through the Event Horizon, they instead stop at the wall and are stunned for half the duration.\n\nOR something like: For 0.75 second before Event Horizon appears, all skills used inside the area have an increased cool down.  This stops highly mobile champions from simply dashing out of range, they have to walk out, and if they do dash they get penalised.\n\nAll that considered, they should just lower the appear time to 0.25 seconds which is dodge-able, but still takes a decent reaction time to do so.","replies":[]},{"poster":"JasonWazza","date":"2015-02-15T04:30:09.772+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Honestly the E change is rito being lazy instead of actually trying to balance the champ","replies":[]},{"poster":"bloodmoth","date":"2015-02-15T08:56:15.563+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"The ability isnt supposed to work by catching the enemy on the edge, thats just how it *has* been used historically and it was ridiculously strong for a basic ability, its like a mini J4 ult, except he isnt put in danger and it stuns instead of stopping people walking out. its supposed to fence them in and limit their area of movement to make dodging skillshots harder, primarily your Dark matter.\n\nWhat you propose is a nerf to immobile champs and a buff to mobile ones, they dont need that buff, they are already strong against veigar as he has no escape and veigar doesnt need a buff vs immobile champs\n\nAlso veigar shouldnt ever be guaranteed to land his dark matter with only his kit, its an incredibly strong ability with a 100% ap ratio, it needs risk, if they lower that risk they better lower that damage, its stronger than most ults! (more than lissandras ult)\n\nE already makes landing dark matter **alot **easier, you can cage them in and drop dark matter between them and the center of the cage to force them to choose 100% ap damage or a stun.\n\nHonestly, the combo is already good as it is! catching a target with an instant aoe slow doesnt require that much skill, and there is still no counterplay for the enemy target.\n\nSo i dont support these changes. playing vs veigar has historically been one of the most frustrating lol experiences in this game, largely because his ult and his stun cage.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Cripplekill","date":"2015-02-15T08:34:15.293+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"people complaining before they even try it... makes me sad.... oh no, they made him a tanky ap bruiser with good sustain dmg instead of an assassin... oh wait that's how a good mage should be. if anything they fixed veigar. his e was bull%%%%... impossible to dodge for a low mobility champ and 0 counterplay. now his focus is on stacking that q and building somewhat tanky, because you don't need to build ap. this changes veigars role entirely, now he can actually get up in that 1v1 and land the w in teamfights. oh a %%%%load more build diversity, because you will only need {{item:3089}}, if you don't like relearning your champ from time to time, i suggest playing dota.","replies":[]},{"poster":"NoobHunter101","date":"2015-02-15T03:24:28.836+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"hey guys check out my channel i do live commentarys hope you enjoy  my youtube name is          TripleDDose\nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UCsCtT4Nj46BEULhY1_lEkNw\n\n\nall support appriciated :)))   i upload on a regular basis","replies":[]}]}
