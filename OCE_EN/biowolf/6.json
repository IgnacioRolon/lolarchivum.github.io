I&#039;m able to buy the skins for Cait, Morg and Wukong, skins (1350 skins at least) are usually on sale when they&#039;re first released, so I&#039;d rather wait for them to go on sale, but the Cait skin is legacy, is it just a mistake or are they out now on purpose? I would imagine they were meant to come out with the next patch/Lunar Revel update","replies":[{"poster":"lordofrage","date":"2016-01-26T05:13:18.404+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"on sale by now","replies":[]},{"poster":"lordofrage","date":"2016-01-26T04:27:01.824+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"they wont be on sale an dont buy morgs one its shet","replies":[{"poster":"BioWolf","date":"2016-01-26T05:04:56.290+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yea I agree, was planning to get the Cait and Wukong skins, sucks they won't go on sale though, still gonna wait till tomorrow though cause that's when NA gets them, and if they ARE going on sale that's when it will be","replies":[{"poster":"lordofrage","date":"2016-01-26T05:12:50.292+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=BioWolf,realm=OCE,application-id=Ntey9fRZ,discussion-id=T9dWPry9,comment-id=00000000,timestamp=2016-01-26T05:04:56.290+0000)\n>\n> Yea I agree, was planning to get the Cait and Wukong skins, sucks they won't go on sale though, still gonna wait till tomorrow though cause that's when NA gets them, and if they ARE going on sale that's when it will be\n\ndo u think it cares if NA gets em it does not care if we get them before them it would be","replies":[]}]}]}]}
