And in a 5v5 scenario it is very easy to keep that delusion afloat _\"I am better than them, but they won cos they got ganks and I didnt\"_, _\"Ahri is 23/4/11, but that's only because she roamed bot and got those 2 early kills, its not my fault.\"_, _\"We lost because my team is heavy.\"_  These are the lies we all tell ourselves to keep our own bubble afloat.  There are so many factors that affect the game, that you often cant really determine with whom the majority of the blame lies, and its so much easier to spread it around the 4 other randoms, than it is to shoulder it yourself. _(which like everything in the game, is of course a clever design to keep people interested)_\n\nI don't think many people could take the harsh realities of a permanent 1v1 mode. The sheer crushing truth that they are just as shit as everyone else would be a bitter pill to swallow for too many people.  Once that bubble is popped, I wouldn't be surprised if people lose interest in the game a little. When you realise that you only win around 50/50 of your games and this time the blame is entirely on you...\n\nSo I think it would have a very very limited lifespan as a mode, and may even have a negative effect on the population of league itself.\n\nSo personally I think a 1v1 mode is something that people think they want, but don't ACTUALLY want.\n\nHowever in saying that, I vote yes.\n1. Because why not. Sounds like a neat game mode for a bit of competitive fun, you could have some awesome map designs too.\n2. It would be so juicy to see cocky SoB's brought crashing down to earth.\n3. It'd be great laning practice where you can focus on certain things like CSing or harassing etc. in a controlled environment. So for people who arent in a bubble, practicing individual skills without having to worry about the rest of the game could be very beneficial.\n\nThere are obvious drawbacks though.\nSupport mains would feel very excluded from the game mode. It'd be no fun vsing a 500,000 mastery point Fiora main, as Bard or Sona.  Even if you weren't support, it'd feel pretty shit if your main wasn't very good in a 1v1 situation.\n\nAlso some champs like Kalista or Sol just couldn't play, literally half of Kalista's abilities _(including her ult)_ just wouldn't exist. So Kalista mains would never get to test their limits. And in a 1v1 situation Sol would be disadvantaged to the point of just not being fun.\n\nDepending on the rules _(is it til first blood? first tower? Is it a 50 minute base defence game?)_ you'd probably find that early game champs just dominated, and late game champs and their players just don't get the time to shine.\n\nBut for those who are competitive and do enjoy that me against them play style, why not. For the sake of a vote i'll say yes. I probably wouldn't play it much myself _(I like my bubble)_, but for those who want it _(or who think they want it)_ why not.","replies":[{"poster":"MicrowaveDaave","date":"2019-01-01T02:42:39.022+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I agree with everything you say but Riot could obviously tweak the mode to where when you pick the 1v1 it has a choice where you pick 'same champion' top lane champs' support champs'","replies":[{"poster":"MurderByVortex1","date":"2019-01-01T10:22:48.263+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"or you could chose first tower/first blood/ 100 cs as one option then have till nexus or whatever rito feels like","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"OCEshots","date":"2018-12-16T21:43:17.616+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"For sure and no idea why there is 2 no votes (@8:47am 17/12/2018) \n\nWould push for this in an Ask Riot edition","replies":[{"poster":"MicrowaveDaave","date":"2019-01-01T02:43:11.152+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"how do I get an ask riot?","replies":[{"poster":"OCEshots","date":"2019-01-23T12:20:01.422+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"just keep asking riot on their news updates","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Lego Wolfer","date":"2019-01-09T11:05:49.473+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I say yes quite willingly.\n\nThe thing is, I'm really bad at the parts of the game where trying to guess the outcome is crucial. Like teamfighting, engaging, trying to save someone, etc. But I'm surprisingly fine at 1v1. I've won against friends who DOMINATE in laning phase, and would really like to see if that is just because they simply can't 1v1 well or if I'm actually good at 1v1. Testing against people my skill lvl (right now, the only person I can't beat would be the Dia player in my close friends list, though unexpected plays net me a couple kills) would let me know around how good I really am. I could also potentially learn how to counter a Champ I previously thought uncounterable unless the player is bad (aka Darius. I really need help, being a toplane main. If I try short trades he just heals back up if I try all ins he gets his 5 stacks easily).\n\nOn the other hand, I could find out I'm bad at the game in every way possible :)","replies":[]},{"poster":"slxw","date":"2018-12-17T05:51:05.816+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I vote yes, but would it be a blind pick or what?","replies":[{"poster":"MurderByVortex1","date":"2019-01-01T09:08:26.396+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I would say options would be the way to go like the options they have for Summoners Rift.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"MurderByVortex1","date":"2019-01-01T08:26:03.336+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I would absolutely love a 1v1 mode as waiting in a custom game for ages isn't fun and when you do find someone they could be much better than you and how much fun is that? \nThis could be a good marketing choice for riot as some old players that have gone away due to 'having shitty teams' and hating the teamwork part of league \nwould bring back players who loved league as a game but hated other parts you get in 5v5 or 3v3. it could also attract new players and it might be what league needs. It changes up the thing that league is, a team based game and makes a queue for players who like the feeling of the game hanging on their shoulders and not having to worry about everyone else. Obviously riot would make it fair but I would recommend making the skill group in which players can go against a bit tighter by only making people vs people in the same rank give or take a little. \nThis also allows riot to make a new map that could be made from the players. We could have a contest or whatever where we submit a sketch or map design and the riot employees chose there 5 favourites then we vote on it. \n(edit) also be nice to make a ranked queue for it and different options whether you want top lane champs or adcs or whatever.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Naddercrusher","date":"2018-12-20T04:27:34.362+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"They should do it where both players choose a champ and then it picks one of them at random.\n\nHalf your games you get to practice your champ.
