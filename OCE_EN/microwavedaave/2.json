It's not seeing what you're looking at, it's reading a name off a list of processes in the same way that discord knows what games you're playing.","replies":[{"poster":"Lord Sesshomaru","date":"2019-01-02T02:22:57.735+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Perhaps your answer though, reveals the actual problem?\nLet's be real, as an isolated issue, League reacting to our searches is a relatively small problem in the scale of things. Perhaps the greater problem is that we justify league doing this by saying \"Ehhh everyone does it.\"\n\nWhen \"Ehhh everyone does it.\" becomes the justification/defence for something, that's when we have a real problem.\n\nOne of the big appeals of the internet is anonymity, I bet half of the people on the planet wouldn't use the internet if it broadcast their searches to everyone they knew.  _(I'm not saying league takes away that anonymity, but the little programs like discord and league doing the small stuff, softens the blow for the big offenders like google and facebook.)_\n\nNow i'm not saying it's our right to have complete anonymity, obviously if we use programs like facebook, we willingly accept the terms of service of that particular program, and such companies do need to analyse data _(within reason)_ in order to know how to improve.  However! I do believe that these programs need to be self contained.\nWether it's just reading a process off a list, or collecting images you post online, they should only be able/allowed to read information within their own app.\n\ni.e. If you search something on google, fair enough, google can collect that information for data analysis. BUT facebook shouldn't be able to, searching something on google has absolutely nothing to do with facebook, therefore that information should be blocked to the social media giant.\n\nIf I like something on pinterest, I don't then wants adds for that on youtube, they are two different applications, and any data collection that happens, should _(in a perfect world)_ stay within that app.\n\nLikewise with steam, if you're playing a game through steam, that's fair enough that steam tells all your friends about it. HOWEVER, discord has no right to know that information. And if it wants to know it, it needs to ask.\n\nSo if you type \"Cheat engine\" into the league client, then fair enough, league can decide what to do with that information.  But league has no right to access google searches in any capacity without permission _(I've read the terms and conditions and (at least back then) it never mentioned anything like that.)_ as google searches have nothing at all to do with the actual function of the app.\n\nThis is my view anyway. What do you reckon?\nMaybe we have to look less at the problem, but actually how we defend and view the problem, and that will reveal the actual issue.","replies":[{"poster":"MicrowaveDaave","date":"2019-01-02T03:16:14.009+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Good comment.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2019-01-02T03:23:43.297+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"If you don't want to give up that privacy, don't use Windows, or at least use a browser that doesn't list tab titles in the process name.\n\nAnyone who believes we are anonymous on the internet should take the time to learn exactly what data they are putting out there. Facebook is a big offender but people still use it because it's convenient. If you don't want a corporate database knowing basically everything about you, don't use Facebook, or at the very least use it in a browser/mode that supports self contained instances. Facebook looks at literally everything.\n\nI wasn't saying \"everyone is doing it so it's fine\", I was saying \"It's not malicious so why does it matter?\". There are steps you can take to protect your privacy if you are concerned about it: \n\nNot using certain services (or using them in a limited capacity), using a trusted VPN, having certain security protocols in place, etc etc. These are the choices we all make, and most people will choose convenience over privacy, but that's still a choice they have made, even if it is by not taking the time to understand the environment.","replies":[{"poster":"Lord Sesshomaru","date":"2019-01-02T05:30:33.845+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I use a Mac, always have, probably always will.\nI also don't have Facebook, never have, _(yet funnily enough they still collect information on me)_.\n\n**Disclaimer:** Im not a guy in a tinfoil hat or anything.  \nI use a mac because 1. i'm a graphic designer, and 2. they're prettier and made of metal instead of plastic (looks matter, call me shallow xD). And I don't have facebook or many other social media outlets because 1. I don't have time to be checking notifications all the time, and if I did get facebook, I couldn't resist but spend time on it, and 2. any friends I need a program to keep track of, are not really meaningful friends.\n\nSpeaking personally i'm not worried about people/businesses collecting information on me, It's not like I have anything big to hide or anything (that i'm aware of?). But that being said, i'd prefer to be asked beforehand, just as a courtesy thing right?\n\nsaying \"It's not malicious so why does it matter?\" is the same thing _(in terms of what I was talking about anyway)_.\nFor example, thats what people who smoke weed say all the time, but it's no secret that most people who do hard drugs started with the smaller ones first.  Yea of course some people don't progress to harder stuff.  But the fact of the matter is, if we get strict on the small stuff, the big stuff looks after itself. League has a 0 tolerance policy of cheating, and whaddayaknow, a lot less people cheat in league than do in other games.\n\n_\"Look after the pennies, and the pounds take care of themselves.\"_\n\nThe moral of the story is, If we as a society get complacent with the small things, the big things come in a lot easier.\nLike Trump, when he does something stupid we just think \"Oh yea but it's Trump, he's going to do stupid things.\" and so it lessens the impact of what he's actually done.\n\nBut like you said, convenience over privacy, I'd rather have aspects of my privacy invaded and be able to use the internet, than not be invaded and not use the internet at all.  But in a perfect world, that shouldn't be a decision we have to make.\nIm not saying we are innocent in all this, we are complacent, and that's what allows all this to happen in the first place.\n\nThis is all speaking hypothetically though. In reality the internet is so vast and so few people truly understand what happens behind it, that it can never truly be policed. so it's a mute point.\nHowever that doesn't mean we shouldn't strive to make it as good as we can, right? ^^","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Outis","date":"2019-01-02T12:13:14.215+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"those apps you quoted do much more than just see what game you are playing just for your status. they collect all kinds of data about you and sell it. im sure tencent does it too through the client for some extra cash. i'll make sure to quote you when it comes out that they do.","replies":[{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2019-01-03T08:41:30.262+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Like I said, that's the choice you make when you choose to use such services.
