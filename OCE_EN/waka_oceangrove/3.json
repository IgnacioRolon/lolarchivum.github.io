Gruff&rsquo;s notably is distinguished by his family&rsquo;s past. \r\nHe is named after his grandfather, the Great Billy Goat Gruff, Guardian of all animals of the bare plains that borders the Tundra. Within the Tundra was the troll horde. For the Guardian, he saw the trolls as vicious and territorial.  \r\nIn the time before Trundle found his Ice club, and overthrew his chieftain, there was mutual harmony between the two races. Two generations before Trundle, there was a renegade troll by the name of Ruzz. He was sly and cunning.  \r\nOne day, he left the tundra and venturing into the bare plains, unbeknown to Billy Goat Gruff, and hid under a bridge. He soon realised that his hiding spot was just below a regularly used road that was the main access point to other regions of the bare plains. He would encourage the small goats to come down and witness his &lsquo;so called treasure&rsquo; before holding them captive and devour them, in less than three mouthfuls.\r\nWhen Billy Goat Gruff heard of this, he was enraged. He devised a plan to lure the troll out from under the bridge and avenge the goats lost. He lured him out with a smaller goat voice and with that, charged the troll against the bridge and broke his neck. Billy Goat Gruff was congratulated by all the bare plain residents. The trolls soon got word of this, but thought better of devising an assault on the goats.\r\n15 years later, all had seemed to be forgiven between the two races, and the trolls decided to hold a ceremony for Billy Goat Gruff, as a token of forgiveness and treaty for peace. But this turned out to be fatal for Billy Goat Gruff and he was assassinated by the troll Chieftain Bartoc, a great uncle to Trundle.  \r\nUltimately, Billy Goat Gruff&rsquo;s son and Gruff&rsquo;s father, Gloat, was driven mad by the feelings of sadness and revenge. He lost all hope within the bare plains, and Billy Goat Gruff&rsquo;s nephew had to take on leadership, as the guardian of the plains.\r\nSo now, Gruff the unruly, must seek redemption and honour for his family, and the only way he can do this, is by avenging his grandfather. Gruff accomplishes this by slaying the many opponents he faces in the Summoner&rsquo;s rift, and there may be a time where he will face the cunning troll whose family ended his grandfather&rsquo;s rain as guardian of the bare plains.","replies":[{"poster":"Whitesmoke","date":"2015-09-16T08:09:28.789+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Reads allgood aye!","replies":[{"poster":"WAKA OceanGrove","date":"2015-09-16T08:11:36.236+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Very !!
