Am i just that bad? should i just quit while im ahead? or should i just keep trying? or is there somewhere i can get some more help? thanks guys. <3 (and yes, i know all the about the people who say, \"gg nerd just uninstall\", i try to ignore them!","replies":[{"poster":"Sackboy","date":"2015-04-24T11:14:58.475+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Don't watch pros, learn from your mistakes, you'll climb in time, master one champ at a time.","replies":[]},{"poster":"ThatzSoDraven","date":"2015-04-24T11:05:50.407+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Practice makes perfect!\nLeague is a pretty tricky online game anyways, I've been playing for two years and just have over 300 norm wins, only started ranked this year, and yeah it's difficult. You don't suck, it takes a while to learn everything from the champs and kits to game play and lingo. And don't forget we all have bad games, even the pros! Literally, just keep playing, it's a game so enjoy it and mute the haters <3\nFor my contribution on a tip, I'd start with finding a character you like and feel comfortable with, sometimes we just can't play some characters well yet, but if you're determined, keep playing and practicing that one character. c:","replies":[]},{"poster":"KidneyxThief","date":"2015-04-24T09:31:26.543+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Keep at it.

If you arent csing that well, go in a custom game and practice. If you cant win trades, either, like mentioned, look back and learn from your mistakes or play another champ that you would feel you are comfortable with.","replies":[]}]}
