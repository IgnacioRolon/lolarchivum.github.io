These minor changes could give some love back to the gamers. Feedback needed.\r\n\r\nTL;DR: \r\n- Tribunal for OCE.\r\n- A bug fix that haunts a lot of the community.\r\n- Art concepts during loading screens and more active quest events in games (like The Hunt is On!). (These should probably be kept for normal games only (or hell, a totally new gamemode), due to it affecting ranked play quite critically).\r\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\nI have played League of Legends for quite a while, and whilst being in a low division in a relatively new server (after the move from NA), I feel like I want the Oceanic server to evolve. This means a few things, first of all, the tribunal.\r\n\r\nThe League of Legends community can be one of the most if not the most competitive out there, but with this trait, anger of unfortunate events does follow. After watching several videos of \"Funny Tribunal Cases\" on YouTube, I question how those cases could be taken seriously. In Oceania, ignoring your whole team in solo-queue is close to necessary. I feel that the trusted community should be able to have a voice in what punishment is due. A 5 game filter isn't going to solve a lot. I feel bad to dis your methods but I think the chat logs need reviewing by the community.\r\n\r\nSecond of all, there have been many bugs crashing the client before every game due to players who have macro-software enabled due to them owning gaming mice and keyboards, even if there aren't any macros set. This needs some looking into. As macroing does seem unfair to general play, I highly suggest that the client uses the exact same tracker before the game starts but instead build it into the uplauncher or into the home screen. This will prohibit players from starting matches until they disable their macro software (with a warning), but will give players the knowledge of why they can't join games, giving them a better understanding of how to avoid bugs or general client mechanisms so they can have a smooth game time without interference.\r\n\r\nLastly, I will bring up art models in the loading screen. Now we know that seasonal and special gamemodes have had a nice background, clever, different loading screens, I highly appreciate this work, and while it may not take too long to make or manage, it means a lot to the community. I would think it would be a great idea to have rivalries displayed in the loading screen (eg Kha'Zix v Rengar in opposing teams), different backgrounds depending on seasonal influences such as championship (season logos like the one on Championship Thresh, maybe even the Summoner's Cup) skin artworks, world champion (eg Fnatic, TPA, SKT, SSW) skin artworks, Valentines, Christmas, April Fool's etc. Maybe even adding more trigger event quests, like with Kha'Zix and Rengar's The Hunt is On! There are a lot more rivalries in the game, one could even be added for full noxus, ionia, demacian teams vs another. It just breathes a bit of lore into the game, and as much as League is about the MOBA gameplay itself, a little bit of lore does help players understand and like champions more. Champions already have great quotes, ability sets and animations which strike our fancy and make us farm all week long for Zed or Yasuo, and at the end, it is worth it, but this idea could open up some love for the underdog champions.\r\n\r\nI wish to see Oceania, and League of Legends improve overall, I hope I have contributed to Riot's cloud of ideas, and I would like to share any further ideas. See you on the rift.","replies":[{"poster":"Slim Chaedi","date":"2015-01-10T07:01:44.997+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I think a thunder stone will help Riot evolve.

I especially like your idea of removing the quests from ranked though. I find in like... 75% of games if it is like \"Sejuani must be dealt with!\" people are more likely to go for Sejuani, same with The Hunt is On. I think those quests can distract people from objectives and, especially in ranked, that can be problematic and may even lead to toxicity when people don't focus the wrong person. \nMoving onto the toxicity though, right says Soonâ„¢ for the tribunal, like with a lot of things.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Dengpao","date":"2015-01-10T09:22:22.996+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It's the player not the system, I've been to different servers and none of the players there are as toxic as OCE players.

I'm not going to talk about the factors, I'm just going to say that OCE is probably the only server in which toxicity is above the Call of Duty rager level. The point is that there needs to be something done about it, the system shouldn't be less severe in a server where players are being more toxic and breaking the rules more often. I'm asking for equality with other servers when it comes to dealing with rule breakers. \n\nI remember reading a post from an OCE Riot member which said that making a tribunal for OCE is just a way for trolls to get a trophy case to see what they've achieved, possibly the dumbest logic I've heard in my life. Okay guys, let's allow them to troll, then they'll feel like they're not breaking the rules and won't feel fed by trolling. Riot, I'm pretty sure trolls know what they're doing, they can tell when you're letting them troll. Ignoring doesn't fix any problems, solution by ignoring is a myth. A golden star sticker on their loading screen (ribbons) isn't going to persuade players to avoid breaking rules. WINNING persuades players to avoid breaking rules. \n\nRiot should give players a clear outline tutorial on roles and pressure. Junglers have a CHOICE if they want to gank your 0/3 lane or not. While they amount cs and towers, you could be leaving lane, they get no kills, meaning they snowball a lot slower, you could be assisting your team by roaming and taking objectives elsewhere, which means you're going to get a lot more gold than if Darius kept dunking you every time you stepped back into lane. You will also end up a lot less frustrated and your team will be thankful for the help, and possibly a bit less annoyed about the 3 kills you gave Darius. \n\nI main support and if my ADC is 3/0, as long as bot is warded, I trust my adc to be able to defend the tier 1 turret whilst earning faster xp and farming cs, while I help mid take the turret to give them a chance to catch up in gold against that pesky Fizz on their hands.\n\nOn the other hand, if our turret is down, the enemy adc is doing better than ours, I still get out of bot lane, my wards are going to be more useful if they are around dragon and the enemy jungle. That mid turret could get our team some gold to catch up for the inconvenience bot lane. We'd have more pressure on dragon and buffs, becoming a mobile squad (this is done a lot in competitive play (eg s4 world finals when SHRC rotates completely to top and Uzi picks up that kill because he knows how much lifesteal he's going to get back, allowing him to live). If the enemy support stays at bot and helps push, they lose xp and pressure. If the enemy support leaves for mid, we can move our mobile squad for an easy kill and the tower on that enemy adc.\n\nAnyways, apart from this \"tutorial\", we still need that tribunal, for obvious reasons.","replies":[]}]}]}
