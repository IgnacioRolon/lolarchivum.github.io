Game must be played in structured set of rules and instead of rewarding from getting an objective, you punished by not getting an objective.\r\n\r\nTL:DR Killing CC in old champions wont save your game, stop adding the mobility does.\r\n\r\nPS sorry for bad grammar but I sincerely think riot is somehow retard right now, can't find a better word for it, it's like cutting toes to fit the shoes.\r\n\r\n{{champion:9}} ckyc","replies":[{"poster":"RNG Remilia","date":"2014-11-27T22:10:33.488+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I don't see any reason to complain about the change of meta, adapt or fall behind is something I've stuck by since deciding to be become a better player during Season 3 when I was in Silver 4 and now I'm Diamond 5 aiming for Master/Challenger in Season 5.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Geldour","date":"2014-11-27T21:55:20.037+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"really? there are alot of awesome old champs that are still very powerful. and fid is one of them.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Pettanko","date":"2014-11-27T13:30:49.561+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":3,"body":"1+","replies":[]}]}
