Much appreciated.","replies":[{"poster":"Rav","date":"2014-12-08T13:14:45.583+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I honestly think CertainlyT is one of the best champion designers.\n\nIt's just that his designs don't fit with the game. What I love about his champions is that they always cause a stir in the meta. Unlike the boring champion releases such as Quinn, Aatrox, and Vel'Koz (although Kalista was a little boring.)\n\nIMO Yasuo was the best last release.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Rav","date":"2014-12-08T13:12:29.849+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"As a Darius main for well over a year, they just need to bring his power back at the cost of his low mobility.

They had made his passive stack to 10 instead of 5 and his ult could perma-reset again.
