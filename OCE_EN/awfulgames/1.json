Glass cannon, backdoorer.\r\n\r\ngive it a try.","replies":[{"poster":"awfulgames","date":"2015-01-15T05:54:38.756+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Nope, in a real game, the enemy jungler will start gank from lvl 2 and if you die once during lane phase you are set back so far behind. Not only that nasus will be missing out on lots of farm. I mean i always kayle top and the enemy nasus rage quit lvl 2.\n\nThis is why nasus should jungle. Even in ranked, people expect nasus to top, but when they counterpick, you counterpick them back which always results in a top lane win. They have no idea which lane nasus is going.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Rok","date":"2015-01-15T04:28:03.366+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"400 Stacks by 20 mins is Standard.

My build is fun because I don't get zoned and i pick my fights.\n\nNormally nasus get zoned when going full tank, and team mates don't even take advantage of the fact you just got poked by 5 champions.\n\nMight as well use alistar.\n\nTeam mates never read your movements and intentions. This is why I play objective - crush towers and get rich fast. Tank nasus means you are slow lane pushing while enemies can farm all day.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Niji","date":"2015-01-15T01:41:56.705+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"LOL I've seen jungle Nasus build tank and come out of jungle with 500 stacks at 20 minutes try harder.","replies":[]}]}
