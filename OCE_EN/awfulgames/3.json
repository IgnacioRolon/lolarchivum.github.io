I checked my email and there was no record keeping last year. I checked the paypal transaction and its still there as proof for purchase of RP. I would not lie and am 100% sure I got the master Yi chosen one skin.\n\nI only have been banned temporarily long ago and if that is the reason for the skin forfeit then that would be **terrible**, then **why **would they remove my skin and continue to let me play? So that I can spend more money again on the same skin? \n\nIf I cannot get back my  master yi skin then I will refund the recent purchases I made and quit the game and gift the rubbish.","replies":[{"poster":"HORSE OF FORCE","date":"2015-03-06T04:30:25.332+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The EULA states that once you give them any money, they're entitle to do what they please with their account.

When you make any purchases with money on the League client, there is a receipt screen and transaction number.","replies":[]},{"poster":"awfulgames","date":"2015-03-05T01:42:33.423+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Unfortunately I can't refund Riot Points too. Looks like I'm gonna have to gift my remaining RP with a skin or something. What  a truly awful way to end my time with this game, having played about 3000 games. That's about 3000*40 minutes =120000, / 60 minutes = 2000 hours played. Mindblowing. In my time playing this game several champions I have already unlocked have been locked, forcing me to unlock again.(No it was not free week champ)\n\nNow my master yi skin is **gone **and very unhappy about it. I will **no **longer support a company that tries to enforce illegal terms. Given that it is a digital good that is non perishable and a recent purchase, and not being to use said product, it is violating Australian Consumer Law.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Crusader charlie","date":"2015-03-05T01:30:53.531+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"if you are gifting %%%% send me one please. other than that, I'm pretty surprised they don't keep longer records","replies":[]}]}
