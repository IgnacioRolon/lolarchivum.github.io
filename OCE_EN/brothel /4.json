So I don&#039;t know if this is fair in honesty. As soon as I joined I play the full game and didn&#039;t AFK at all. I really don&#039;t wanna do 5 20 minute queues for something out of my control. If it was on my own accord AFKing like my previous priority queue by all means I&#039;d deserve it.\r\n\r\nCan anything can be done about this or am I just going to have to cop it sweet, which I probably will because riot does nothing to help anyone. haha laters","replies":[{"poster":"Project Xayah","date":"2015-12-19T07:06:04.164+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Thing about Leavebuster is that it will *never* give you an LPQ for one game, that's not how it works. In fact first game you leave is just a pop-up reminding you that leaving is bad, the one you need to type \"I agree\" for. Getting an LPQ for two games is rare, at best. Usually takes 3-7 leaves to be hit with a 5 minute LPQ, depending on how often it occurs. After that it would take just one leave to get hit with the next level (10 minute and 20 minute), but without those first few leaves it wont happen.\n\nThing is, you definitely would've had to leave more than 1 game to end up in your current situation, and the fact you've admitted to intentionally leaving games just means it's more than fair that this is happening. After all, why should dozens (if not hundreds) of other players suffer because of your choices or because you don't have a stable enough connection?","replies":[{"poster":"Brothel ","date":"2015-12-19T10:09:15.529+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"That was the first game i've intentionally AFKed in half a year or so.

It goes off percentage games, if your AFK percentage is high, you will get a ban for any AFK longer than 4 minutes. \n\nGood thing is that **bot games** count towards this percentage, so maybe spam a few bot games a day to bring your percentage down. Also I heard if you AFK in a bot game the punishment is less than a PVP game, no creditable source on that though.","replies":[]}]}
