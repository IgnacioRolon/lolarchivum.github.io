Your first post didn't put more emphasis on the fact that he didn't die, which sounds stupid as a pure bullet point. But still, 8 kills doesn't make up for a 500 gold bounty given?\n\nThat's a decent reason as to me getting an A+ instead of an S-, but why did Rumble get an S- with that score? Yes, he didn't die, but does that really make up for all the gold I got (and my team) from an extra 8 kills?","replies":[{"poster":"GigaPube","date":"2015-08-09T12:19:04.138+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"yeah fook my first post m8. i dont agree with the system ultimately. ULTIMATELY. so above all else, there is no possible way to truly grade someones performances with a computerised system. but if you had to make a system, no deaths and participating in takedowns should be more greatly awarded than a bunch of kills that couldve just been ks's (im sure they arent) but yeah like, otherwise you'd see katarinas always being higher grades than sustain supports like soraka/sona/nami","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]}
