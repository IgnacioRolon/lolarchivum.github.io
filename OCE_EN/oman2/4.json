It all varies depending on what champs there are, who is fed on either team, and objectives lost thus far. To understand how to win in that situation, the first thing you have got to look at is why teams with 5 usually beat teams with 4, and reverse engineer results for yourself if you're on the receiving end.\n\nSo, why do teams with 5 players generally beat teams with 4? Numbers. As soon as your team is a man down, the enemy simply have to send one player to split push top and bot. The rest of the team simply then pushes mid or some other objective, and against a full team, 4 people just can't hold all those lanes, especially once one or two inhibs go. Plus you've got dragon/baron control, and of course, as soon as any of you go out into the jungle or out of base, you get ganked by 5 players.\n\nHopeless right?\n\nWell no, just reverse it.\n\nThe first thing to do is cut down on the numbers advantage. When it's 4v5, you have got to play the long game. You're no longer going to win a team fight and sweep for gg. Well not likely, but again, depends who was fed or not before the d/c. You've got to play defensive. No one out of your base past roughly the buffs. They will push lanes, but you just sit near your base, get the gold and cs, and keep rotating, not engaging in a fight. The towers are your 5th player. If you farm too far our in a lane, you'll get ganked, and won't be able to rotate along all lanes quickly to make sure they don't take your towers. They can dive you, but you'll likely trade. That's when you'll make progress somewhere. As soon as some numpty goes out to solo that inhib tower, he's gonna get ganked, then it's a 3v5 and they'll take baron, and roll you. Play defensive.\n\nWhen you trade, or you win a skirmish, that's when you make ground. Cs. Cs. Cs. They tower dive. They recall, you take a third health from a tower, or take a buff, or push minions up lane so you can ward jungle. Keep doing this until everyone is full build and level 18. That way, it's pretty even if you're collected and patient. The more time you wait, the more likely it will turn in your favour.\n\nThat is apart from one big blue monster: Baron. If you play defensively as per above, and do it well, 9 times out of 10 this will happen: \"Omigosh, it's 4v5, why can't we kill these guys yet! I'm sick of them sitting under towers! Let's just get baron and destroy them, group mid\". This happens almost every time. Baron is the only thing that will make you lose consistently. so, how to stop them getting baron? Well there is an exception to the 'no one out past buffs' rule, and that's except to ward baron. If you can't see at least 3 or 4 members of their team at all times, send someone out to baron if it's not already too late. They'll expect you to be playing defensively, so sometimes you can surprise them if they're trying to take baron with only one or two players, and either kill them, or steal baron. Controlling vision around baron and dragon and trying to steal them EVERY time is the only way you will be able to make meaningful gains.\n\nLosing a player for baron, is worth. Losing two or three trying to steal it is not. Be selective. Don't just fight because you think you should. Usually it's gg if they get baron, but not always. But it's definitely gg if you commit the entire team to baron, and lose. Just one person unless your vision shows someone trying to solo it. If you get baron, that's when you can counter strike. Push side lanes past halfway, then hard push mid, or whatever lane is most vulnerable. If they got baron, and you didn't lose anyone, or maybe just one person who warded/tried to steal it, then just defend. Sometimes teams can get cocky and ace themselves thinking they're invincible with baron buff. Either way, don't team fight now unless it's under a tower. Most likely it'll be under your nexus tower. Let them take an inhib if it's too dangerous. You cannot afford to lose more than one player at any one time, but you can still bounce back from losing an inhib.\n\nThis stage of the game can actually go on for quite a while if you're decent at defending and have good cc. Hopefully your d/c'd team mate has reconnected? Maybe one of their team has rage quit? It's a war of attrition. If you're still not getting lucky, you will want to start to build to counter their carries. Whoever is most fed, build to counter them. Fed adc? Get thornmail. Shaco trying to backdoor? Upgrade your lens. Burst down too often? Get Banshee's veil. Whatever the case, try and negate their fed champs as much as possible while still staying mostly balanced. That way, when they get tired and try to group mid for one last push, you can surprise them and slay their carry first up, and then chase the rest down. That's when you rush baron, drag, and inhibs. Even if you only have time to get one inhib, don't overstay your welcome. Retreat and do it all over again. Do not push for the win unless you have it.\n\nAnd that's basically my strategy when playing 4v5. Again, depends on your team comp, their team comp, who is fed etc etc. I never get disheartened. I had a game the other day where our nexus was at quarter health. Their riven got cock and tried to get me past nexus, and I flayed her into our fountain. We then aced them, pushed two inhibs. Now they were on the backfoot, we got baron, and then pushed all three lanes and won. You never know what will happen, so play safe, and smart, and be positive.","replies":[{"poster":"Essembie","date":"2015-08-30T11:43:32.308+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I really like the articulation of using the turrets as the 5th player.

Maybe start rattling off some key tips on how you can win it (summarise all of the above maybe into play defensive, steal baron, use towers, counter their carry and rotate on lanes), or maybe you can lie. Like \"Oh the guy who left is my buddy, yeah he uhâ€¦ text me and said he was reconnecting as we speak. Keep playing until he rejoins!\" or some story about how you just played a game 4v5 and you got a penta and won. Be creative, and stay positive - it's infectious, just as much as negativity.
