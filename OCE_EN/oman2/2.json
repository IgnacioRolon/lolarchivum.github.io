When we can&#039;t understand what they&#039;re saying, or they can&#039;t speak/type in English, it can cause massive problems and make coordination difficult, if not impossible.\r\n\r\nSo, I propose that Riot adds a translate option so that we can talk to people from other countries. If Google can do it, why not LoL?","replies":[{"poster":"Tele","date":"2015-09-18T12:41:56.475+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":2,"body":"\"it can cause massive problems and make coordination difficult\" maybe this is a slight exaggeration. Foreign players are only an issue for 2 reasons\n\n1. They talk too much in their own language. Almost to the point of spam.\n2. They wont understand some very minor game coordination issues. e.g \"Are you building Frozen Heart? I already have it, you should build a different item.\"\n\nThey understand pings just fine, and as long as they're not complete noobs they'll understand whether we're supposed to play passive for a bit.\n\nA translator wouldn't hurt, but it's definitely not a priority. Sandbox mode and tribunal reforms are much more crucial right now.","replies":[{"poster":"Oman2","date":"2015-09-18T12:56:51.046+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Ok, maybe I did exaggerate a bit, but that's marketing for ya ;)\n\nAnyway, the problem as I can see is when those coordination problems arise. They don't in every game, but when you're trying to tell that one guy to stop tower diving, if he only speaks Korean, it won't work. There's so much that can be gained from talking to your team, not everyone will care, but it can be really helpful and make the game even more fun. It's just not the same if they are speaking a different language. Even worse if it's a 4-man that's yelling at you in another language and spamming you with pings.\n\nBut yeah, a tribunal would be nice in the mean time.","replies":[]}]}]}
