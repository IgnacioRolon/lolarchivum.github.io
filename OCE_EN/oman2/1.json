It makes sense, subtle nudge toward duo lanes with Morde, and a speed buff is always nice with how damn slow he is - but what I don&#039;t like is not having it available without another champion (or pet) nearby.\n\nOk they reworked the ability, fine. But please give me *something* for when I&#039;m in a solo lane, or when my support is not humping my leg. Please?\n\nEDIT: Also, thoughts on new animation for E? I liked the \"summoning random metal\" more.","replies":[{"poster":"BarryButcher","date":"2015-08-21T08:00:21.455+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yeh, I have no idea why they would DESTROY his solo laning power in order to force him into a gimmicky bot lane... atleast let you W a minion even if they nerf the damage it does in order to allow you to do it.","replies":[]}]}
