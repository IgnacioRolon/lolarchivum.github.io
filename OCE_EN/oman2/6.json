After this period it appears that whatever happened will be shown in a \"burst\" (very quickly) and the game will continue.\n\nThe closest I can think of is when you&#039;re disconnecting - people stop moving, you keep walking through the wall, minions keep attacking but are stuck etc. Problem is, although I can see my ping bar spiking horrendously, I&#039;ve never actually disconnected or even seen the \"Connecting...\" bar at the top of the screen.\n\nI put a ticket in to support, and got a brief response, but it was passed on to the technical side of things I guess; after that it took *9 days* before I heard another peep, and the best they had was a copy/paste \"run a systems check\" checklist. I **know** there&#039;s nothing wrong with my drives, CHKDSK confirmed, there&#039;s nothing wrong with my RAM, or my GPU - Hell I&#039;m playing Mass Effect 2 in parallel and I&#039;ve got no problems.\n\nI sent all of the results back with the mp4 I mentioned before to visualise what I&#039;m seeing and the only response I got was a brief \"try a clean boot?\" with instructions. This had no impact and I told them so, but 4 days later I&#039;ve heard nothing back.\n\nHelp me OCE Community, you&#039;re my only hope!\n\n\nSome visuals:\nhttps://www.dropbox.com/s/4xvb6qnqajt98d5/8.28.15%20Normal.7z?dl=0","replies":[{"poster":"darkdraagoon","date":"2015-09-07T12:44:55.470+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Like my friend and I have the same problem, we were having a game just before this post, when I or him enter combat, everything like frozen, I can see my hp bar drop but can't do anything. The problem is we played in our own house, that means 2 computers, 2 ISP, 2 problem not 1. Our ping is fine, with out combat I can still do a full combo on Leblanc, he still can farm and use skill with Amumu, but as soon as we had big combat, problem happened. So I don't know if this is what but I think this is the sever problem more than our computer problem.","replies":[{"poster":"Oman2","date":"2015-09-07T13:34:14.601+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yeah that's exactly it, whenever a fight happens, massive freeze/lag/screw up whatever. As soon as I die or back off it all goes away. No problems at all for the rest of the time - it is *very* hard to replicate this though, so I can't prove if it's still happening or not.","replies":[{"poster":"Mindstar","date":"2015-09-08T01:12:58.612+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hi\n\nThe support ticket option is definitely the way to go.  They will be able to help you get to the bottom of the issue. That said, when you experience the issue it seems like you describe one issue in your original post, and another in this reply...  \n\nCan you clarify whether the client freezes totally (ie. screen frozen / nothing is moving), or whether the video is still rendering/animating but nothing is happening (eg. minions standing still but animations still playing).\n\nCheers\nMindstar","replies":[{"poster":"Oman2","date":"2015-09-08T05:33:31.590+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Sorry mindstar, I was being brief so as not to dissuade people with a wall of text.\n\nThis doesn't happen in all matches, but when it does it mostly consists of what appears to be disconnects *most frequently during team fights*. The most noticeable problem is that all champion animations will either stop or not play; it does appear that I am still able to cast/move etc. but it does not immediately display on my screen. When it does display, I see \"slices\" of the action where everything happens at once, and then the animations will pause once again - or in some cases all animations will stop, and the only movement I see is the decrease in health of champions.\n\nTo clarify a bit more on \"freezing\": my game does not actually disconnect (\"Attempting to reconnect...\" at top), nor does it CTD or the application itself appear to experience any issues, all animations play smoothly, and when the game continues it all plays smoothly. The ping bar does appear to spike through the roof however.\n\nIs there a way I can upload a screen capture of a game I recorded for you?","replies":[{"poster":"Mindstar","date":"2015-09-08T05:59:59.612+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"For a uploading a video capture, your best bet would be youtube, or some kind of file sharing (google drive, dropbox etc).\n\nThere's a couple of issues I'm thinking here.  \n\nWhen the issue happens - does your FPS stay stable? (what is it usually?)\nAlso, it could be some kind of packet loss.  An easy (visual) way to check it out is to use http://logsoflag.com/\nDo you play on wifi or is your PC connected to your router via a cable?","replies":[{"poster":"Oman2","date":"2015-09-08T06:54:33.667+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Well, my mp4's don't have screen stats unfortunately, but I'll see what I can do about it. I'm doubting it's my PC's fault, more likely either my network - cable to my router then on to my ISP - or some connection in the game, but I doubt its the game files, I've reinstalled and repaired trying to fix this.\n\nHere's my screen captures; first one is more of the total \"freeze\" I was talking about, while the second is more so the \"slices\" of the game I mentioned.\nhttps://www.dropbox.com/s/4xvb6qnqajt98d5/8.28.15%20Normal.7z?dl=0\n\nI don't have a network logs of a dodgy game, so I'll try and get a screen grab of those stats along with a log and attach them to this post later on.","replies":[{"poster":"Oman2","date":"2015-09-09T02:49:00.282+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hi again Mindstar, I've attached a link to a couple of files; two recordings of problems in one game, the associated network log, and the results from http://logsoflag.com/\n\nhttps://www.dropbox.com/s/d2iwkw35s6cezh0/Network%20logs%20with%20video.7z?dl=0","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]}
