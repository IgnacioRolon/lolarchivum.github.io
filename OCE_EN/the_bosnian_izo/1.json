Maybe it might be worth just leaving it as it is (don't fix it if it isn't broken), instead of risking it catastrophically dropping because of something you tried.\n\nNevertheless if you've determined that the game does run better than it is currently it would be worth investigating. What OS are you running on that laptop, and who's your ISP?","replies":[{"poster":"The Bosnian Izo","date":"2015-05-26T09:51:34.113+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Well i got used to play on that smooth fps but now the feeling isnt the same and even a litlle lag is seen...\nI run Windows 8.1 and my ISP is Austrian A1.\nAll the help and feedback is apriciated!","replies":[{"poster":"HORSE OF FORCE","date":"2015-05-27T12:48:11.983+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Check out [this page](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752684-Low-Frame-Rate-FPS-troubleshooting). Mainly, check for heat and that everything is updated. Even if a program tells you everything is fine, it could be that the thermostat is wrong.\n\nI would also suggest uninstalling programs such as \"Speccy\", because they may be hampering the function of your computer. If you've installed anything else that monitors or claims to \"enhance\" your computer, try playing League with those uninstalled.","replies":[]}]}]}]}
