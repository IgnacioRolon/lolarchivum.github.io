Accounts that are caught using hacks to gain an unfair competitive advantage are subject to permanent suspension. etc etc etc\r\n\r\n\r\nabout 5 days later they get some specialist to look into my case and he adds:\r\n\r\nHey there,\r\n\r\nThe evidence we found on your account confirmed for us that the client played on was modified in a way to give an unfair advantage over others. We take the use of modifications very seriously and consider it an egregious act against the League of Legends community. The negative affect the account had on the community is irreversible and it had an extremely negative impact on the other players in the game. Since this is the case we will not be adjusting the permanent ban.\r\n\r\nI know you have some unanswered questions about your suspension which I know is frustrating. However, I won&#039;t be able to give any specifics as this will compromise our investigation process. Often times players will write in to figure out how they got caught so they can prevent getting caught again in the future. I am not saying that this is your intent, because I do not believe that it is, but this is why we do not go into specifics about our investigations.\r\n\r\nI dont understand, ive never cheated nor used scripts or anything and they randomly perma ban my account?? FOR NO REASON.\r\n\r\nHas this happened to anyone else and have you gotten your account back????? please help!!!","replies":[{"poster":"Romeo","date":"2016-04-28T17:13:27.301+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"this happened to me too yesterday, i've got only an pre-scripted answer.\nI sent back to them though, i'm gonna visit riot office for real.\nI never ever used anything.","replies":[]},{"poster":"SuperKolz","date":"2016-04-10T05:07:24.844+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey, any news on this? \nJust had the same thing happen to me and i have never used any 3rd party program ever.
