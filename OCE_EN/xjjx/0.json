I carried a game just before with a yasuo as my wing-man, he got an S from the mastery system and I got an A+.\r\n\r\nMy logic dictates I should have got the S an he the A since I carried harder. Im a little confounded about the outcome.\r\n\r\nMy score was: 22/4/4\r\n\r\nMy friends Score: 12/5/1\r\n\r\nCan someone explain to me how to get more S&#039;s and why I may not have gotten one this match and previous matches?\r\n\r\nCheers,\r\n\r\nJJ","replies":[{"poster":"JasonWazza","date":"2016-04-05T16:12:13.965+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Mostly it's because it's based on the server's Stats on the champion.\n\nCorki tends to have an easier time getting a high KDA (especially low deaths) as his currently extremely strong, while Yasuo tends to be a hit or miss champion, meaning he would have an easier time getting an S.\n\nHaving a look through your match history your tending to play champs that are actually in a category that you have to do extremely well to actually hit them S marks.
