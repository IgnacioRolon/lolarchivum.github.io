There was also a purchase of $100 RP and a subsequent server transfer and I don&#039;t know where to. The account name seems to be Skytek991 now as this is the ID that responds to my support tickets. Since lodging my tickets the account has also been banned.\n\nI have provided an enormous amount of documentation to confirm that I am the original and sole owner of the account but it has been ignored due to single line responses of &#039;close&#039; from the thief. When lodging account recovery tickets you need to sign out of any account, this means that I don&#039;t seem to be able to affiliate the request with a different email address or account name where the thief cannot access the tickets. \n\nI can link to the support ticket but there is personal information within it.\n\nI am completely at a loss of how to resolve this situation. \n\nDoes anyone have any ideas of how to proceed, and can a Riot member please contact me if at all possible?\n\nRegards,\nMarsvoltian\n\nEDIT: I have just lodged another ticket but contacting via another email address to see if that prevents the thief from reading/responding to the ticket. \n\nImage: http://puu.sh/o2cif.png\n\nHere you can see the type of documentation I have attached to see if there is anything else I should include.","replies":[{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2016-04-02T04:19:12.814+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey :)\n\nYou should be right with the new ticket, the ban will have been support putting a lock on your account most likely. Support are the only ones that can help you with this stuff, and it looks like you've taken all the right steps here.\n\nThat said, do keep us posted here, if something else comes up we may be able to help you out a bit, and personally I'd be curious to know when you get this all resolved :)","replies":[]}]}
