Despite me saying this someone's still bound to say something like \"but a good whoever would/wouldn't do this or that\".\n\nTop would be an even match since the matchups, both have just as much vulnerability as there are opportunities for each other to capitalize on, Irelia can stun GP but he has the cleanse, Irelia has better dueling power but GP has burst through barrels etc\n\nJungle, well Diana is far more superior at ganking, but in a duel Kindred probably won't fair well if Diana gets snowballing. I don't see how Kindred can win against Diana in a duel unless Diana was put very far behind, plus Kindred needs to farm those passive stacks. This one goes to Team A.\n\nMid would be alike top lane but on steroids, a good Cass would destroy Yasuo, but a good Yasuo would destroy Cass. Mechanically speaking both have insane potential and are both fairly even.\n\nADCs would have to go to Ashe due to her dueling potential being much better than Caitlyn with her Q, but Caitlyn can do just as well if she utilizes her Headshots well. The only edge that Ashe gets is her R which is basically the 'best' 1v1 initiation an ADC could want (so far). This one goes to Team A again.\n\nSupports would have to be Nami as her Q is more reliable than Bard's Q, her heal is more potent, can heal up to 2 people and has a damage portion for the enemies. Bard would do well in other aspects of utility but mechanically speaking Nami is far more superior. \n\nIn teamfights, mechanically speaking Team A would have the edge due to the insane combo potential, GP R, Diana jumps in with QR into the middle of them and E to pull everyone in as Yasuo comes in to R while Nami Rs and Ashe just pummels them at a distance. Team B has less of a combo potential, the only real major comboing tool being either Bard's R or Cass R. By measure of pure destruction, Team A has this one.\n\nWhen it comes to seiging, Team A would still have the edge since Diana's passive works on turrets, and if Ashe ramps up her Q then that melts turrets also, Diana's Q, GP's barrels and Yasuo are all great at clearing waves fast and effectively. \n\nOverall I would say Team A would win.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Chalze","date":"2016-09-22T08:13:43.069+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Incase it was unclear, Yasuo can R off Diana's E","replies":[]}]}
