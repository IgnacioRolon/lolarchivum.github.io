For example :\r\n\r\nTake a champion like {{champion:131}} Diana, who can easily one shot someone Mid-Late game. Then, take another champion like {{champion:61}}  Orianna, who does damage, but can&#039;t one shot like Diana does. In this sense, is it right to say Diana is a stronger champ than Orianna? is it right to say she brings more to her team, or is there more to it?\r\n\r\nIf the answer is Yes, (Diana is technically a stronger champion than Orianna), does that mean a team a team that picks 5 champions that can one-shot will be more superior to a team that picks champions like Orianna, Elise, Morgana, etc. Please Elaborate :)","replies":[{"poster":"Freddymc","date":"2016-09-22T08:52:25.021+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"First of all, orianna can one-shot people. Secondly, tanks exist for a reason. Thirdly, league isn't all about killing enemies and doing damage.\nYou make a team of burst champs, and then cry as you get ripped apart by juggernauts and completely stopped by cc.","replies":[{"poster":"iLasVegas","date":"2016-09-22T09:28:06.765+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thanks for clearing it up for me. I've gotten the hang of one shotting with diana, haven't seen it happen with ori yet but time will tell :)","replies":[{"poster":"Nightjar","date":"2016-09-22T10:30:22.358+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"In the right situation using her ult, oriana can 1 shot not just a single target like diana, but an entire team. Orianna is often one of the most common key damage sources in wombo combos, others being mf ,malphite, ect...","replies":[{"poster":"KawtYouNow","date":"2016-10-02T20:39:13.335+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"i've played with an amazing orianna on my team i was playing top lane, and im like oh ok ill roam mid, i come and i just watch the enemy rengar AND the swain both get one shot in the space of about 10 seconds. I turned around and walked the other way, i wasnt needed there.","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Josh The Locke","date":"2016-09-22T11:59:38.487+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Overall if depends on your play style, many \"1-shot\" champs are usually assassins such as {{champion:107}} , {{champion:238}} , {{champion:55}}  to name a few. But lets say you want to teamfight, probably someone like {{champion:61}} or {{champion:268}} would be of more help overall than the \n\"1-shotters\". \n\n\"1-shot\" champs take skill, but usually can only take 1 person down, which would be a high priority target like the adc or ap carry but than lack the damage or abilities (as their on cooldown) to do anything else. (apart from {{champion:55}} ).\n\nSo to answer you question, it depends on the scenario, of you are doing a 1v1, one shots would probably be better, (unless \"1-shot\" vs tank), a jungle skirmish, one shots again. But of your doing an open 5v5 teamfight in the midlane, a fighter or mage would probably be more beneficial to the team as a whole.","replies":[]}]}
