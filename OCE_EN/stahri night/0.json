Really a bummer to have this happen on a Friday eh :'(\n\nI just want to let you know that Riot are aware of this issue and are working on a fix for it.  It is unclear if we'll be able to roll something out tonight at this stage, so it might be something we have to put up with for the evening.\n\nDefinitely have a look at the workarounds mentioned in the thread to get your games started.   Once the lobby is made and in queue, you should be good to go.\n\n\nCheers!\nMindstar","replies":[{"poster":"Unicorn Wizard","date":"2019-09-27T10:02:37.565+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thanks for your efforts, certainly a sucky situation for everyone to go into the weekend with (Including you guys!).\n\nHope the team can come up with something, to save everyone's weekend!\n\n{{sticker:sg-zephyr}}","replies":[{"poster":"Mindstar","date":"2019-09-27T11:11:03.807+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":4,"body":"Thanks!

U literally get paired with people who clearly dont know how to play. Tyler asked riot about it and they said they are making progress....dude the season ends in two months and all of us have been constantly asking to fix the matchmaking and pairing system for at least 3 seasons. ive seen more skins come out in the past 3 years of this game than i have actual fixes for it. i dont know why riot keeps releasing skins instead of fixing so many and constantly questioned problems but its really irritating.  riot seriously if ANYONE is from the company is reading. Get it together and stop messing around with skins, actually listen to the public requests. no1 asks for prettier champs with nicer skins and if they do i can bet you anything in the world that what people want more is a balanced game, that doesnt crash, that has proper matchmaking  in terms of able players with non able players, a decently stable client etc. i climbed to plat 1 in las, and the server over there is horrible, ud think that over here things would be different, but honestly its the exact same if not worse. It really is the most irritating thing ive seen in a game that i have played for so long.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Faiiry","date":"2019-09-27T05:15:58.407+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"same!","replies":[]},{"poster":"uNhoLeee","date":"2019-09-27T04:02:16.669+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"same. it said i was on aram in a ranked match. next game queued up i cant see the timer, not sure its gonna queue pop","replies":[]},{"poster":"VÃ¡nilla","date":"2019-09-27T03:42:43.400+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"This is the same for me","replies":[]},{"poster":"Unicorn Wizard","date":"2019-09-27T02:53:16.491+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Heyo!\n\nI've just posted on the Help and Support forums on this as well.\n(https://boards.oce.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/help-support-oce/LGEAmyj4-clientserver-lobby-issues)\n\nI've spoken with Riot Support on Twitter and they've advised that the issue is known and being investigated, and related to OCE servers.\n\nHopefully a fix comes soon. \n{{sticker:sg-soraka}}","replies":[]}]}
