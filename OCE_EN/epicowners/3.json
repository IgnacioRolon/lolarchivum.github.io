I have been playing since season 1 and played ranked in season 2 hence my cup and this new leaver buster is fked go back to the old riot, people do not leave games any more to piss someone off (Not as often) but most of the time its the clients fault or the computer at hand which people can not control (Sadly im one of those people with a bad pc)  and this happens to me about 1 time a week so every week i have to wait 120 miniutes in total before i can even get into que which equals to about 3 games, so your wasting my time because of a stupid system you havnt refined.
