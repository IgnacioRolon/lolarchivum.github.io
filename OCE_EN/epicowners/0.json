Your placement into a low priority queue shows that you have left a number of match-made games, and all of those times probably can't be put down to \"Riot's fault\".  Because leaving is a regular occurrence to you, I would suggest addressing the issues that are causing you to leave. \n\n* Is it time to upgrade your computer?\n* Is it time to upgrade your internet?\n* Are you starting games when you don't have a full hour to commit?\n* Are you inclined to rage quit when things go bad?\n\nIf you would like some reading material during your wait, I suggest you read this [update to the leaver buster system](http://oce.leagueoflegends.com/en/news/game-updates/player-behavior/updates-leaverbuster) as well as the [full leaver buster FAQ](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752714-LeaverBuster-FAQ).","replies":[{"poster":"epicowners","date":"2016-02-28T09:14:39.721+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Dude the problem isnt my computer its my league client, and im pretty sure other people have had these problems but waiting 20m for a mere 10m disconect dosnt add up and its not like i gave up and just let my team lose, i played my dam ass off also thanks for the links you have provided","replies":[{"poster":"fattyhotdogs","date":"2016-02-29T02:00:37.001+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"If the league client works perfectly for me, and horribly for you, then one must conclude that there is some outside contributing factor. Like your computer. Clean the shit out. Get rid of your porn. Clean up the registry (I bet you haven't done that in ages if at all) uninstall all that software you haven't used in 18 months. Disable half of the software that starts up automatically that you don't need. Simple shit like this will fix your issues.
