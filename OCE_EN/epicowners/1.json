But after a couple of months I see it was just a mistake, the oce staff have given 0 information on when 3v3 or dominions going to be opened. People like to be informed and not kept in the dark can you give us atleast a rough estimate when its going to be open","replies":[{"poster":"Katsprky","date":"2015-10-03T19:38:49.320+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I personally would like 5v5 Ranked Teams more because it enables our region to have a competitive scene alongside that, it's not the old 3v3 Map so it's not the true love that we want.\n\nThat being said, I would love to have a 3v3 ranked mode. (I got Silver ranked last season in the time we could play it because of the bug and no one can take that away from me.) The best way to get the game mode activated is to seduce your friends into playing the game and repeat that with their friends, etc.","replies":[]},{"poster":"ƒamous","date":"2015-10-03T08:52:58.275+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"OCE doesn't have the playerbase for specific gamemodes. Dominion isn't even out yet and Ranked 5v5 only recently got put on permanent online status. Give it some time we're not NA who have hundreds of millions of players. Australia, the biggest country in OCE only has a population of ~24 million.","replies":[{"poster":"epicowners","date":"2015-10-03T09:03:13.820+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The problem is that their keeping us out of what their doing and not giving the community much feed back on when stuffs going to happen","replies":[{"poster":"ƒamous","date":"2015-10-03T09:32:32.007+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"They have given us information. If you actually came here (instead of complaining) and read their posts you'd know that the playerbase simply isn't big enough to open any new gamemodes.
