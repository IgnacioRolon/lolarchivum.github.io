What even are the requirements for low priority","subforum":"Help & Support (OCE)","up_votes":8,"down_votes":5,"body":"I just finished my 5 games of low priority today because I got them originally because of a power outage during a game and it that lasted 3 hours in my area (couldn&#039;t get back in, wasn&#039;t a 4 hour hostage game sadly). However after playing a 3v3 game today I leave for maybe 1 minute max to go to the toilet (still staying in the game and not getting any AFK warnings). I finish the game, we end up losing and I come out and I get put straight back into low priority queue again. Can someone please explain to me what the requirements even are for being put into low priority queue besides leaving games because if you cant even leave for a 1 minute piss break now what has league turned into.\n\nAlso honestly what is the point in making the entire league client obsolete through making the only option for you to have while waiting is to leave queue. You cant talk to anyone through league, you cant browse the store or champions. Practically you have to sit and wait the 20m in order to reply to a chat message or leave queue and restart the 20m timer.\n\nRiot please either fix the requirements for being put into low priority or at least change it to where you are able to reply to messages while waiting for the ridiculously long queue timer.{{sticker:sg-shisa}} ","replies":[{"poster":"i sIept with dad","date":"2018-05-25T09:51:28.160+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"maybe dont take a toilet break during a 20 minute 3v3 game. how small is your bladder? did u ever get potty trained. i am lost for words, please take babysteps and enjoy your 100 minutes of low priority queue.","replies":[{"poster":"epicowners","date":"2018-05-25T10:13:40.750+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=i sIept with dad,realm=OCE,application-id=ElA0rvVL,discussion-id=YE51tRKQ,comment-id=0002,timestamp=2018-05-25T09:51:28.160+0000)\n>\n> maybe dont take a toilet break during a 20 minute 3v3 game. how small is your bladder? did u ever get potty trained. i am lost for words, please take babysteps and enjoy your 100 minutes of low priority queue.\n\nThe 3v3 game went for over an hour.

Surely Riot can create a way for the client to tell if it's from a DC, Crash, Power loss of actually just being afk. And YESS, definitely make it so that we can at least browse the client still. There are so many things you could still do while waiting for the queue timer.","replies":[]}]}
