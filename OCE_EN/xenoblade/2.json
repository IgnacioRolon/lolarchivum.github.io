I&#039;ve been trying my best to just ignore people, the problem is every single game there we be either 1 lane steal and 1 of the following;\r\n-Intentional feeders\r\n-Intentional afkers\r\n-Flamers / angry people\r\n\r\nI just played a game where we had someone lock in their Yasuo top, and then a Singed locked in top and proxied first few minutes. The Yasuo was mad about this (i think) but he still played top. Singed was only proxying, but Yasuo couldn&#039;t get any farm. So he died to the enemy top laner, and starting feeding intentionally. Nothing could convince him otherwise. On the rest of the map we were winning, and could&#039;ve won. He kept going &quot;He instalocked, I ruin the game. Simple&quot;. And when I told him to stop he said &quot;How about i show mid some love&quot;. All the effort I put into the mirror matchup kat defeating her was lost.\r\n\r\nI know people don&#039;t like to listen to other people&#039;s shenanigans but this is appalling. I&#039;ve had this account for a while so I kind of get that it slowly progresses to get better, but what about a completely new player? What are they going to think? I&#039;ll tell you what, they will probably give up and not play. Everyone is telling them to uninstall.\r\n\r\nHere is the current state of low level games. 1-2 new players, 8 one trick bronze smurfs that don&#039;t really outperform the new guys, some reason picked beginner when they made their smurf because they want to feel good at the game. They will act incredibly toxic and ruin the game if things don&#039;t go there way. This is not only frustrating for new players but makes them act this way.\r\n\r\nThe report system seriously needs to be more effective. If people are doing stuff like this they don&#039;t stop after a warning or chat restriction. It should be a timed ban or something. This is a punishment that will both make an impact on reform and will prevent players from turning like this. I really want to keep playing and pick this game up but you have me a complete noob dumpstering people like &quot;RivenMaster420&quot; or some garbage.\r\n\r\nAt this point I&#039;m going to have to play with my friends because queuing solo is too disruptive to my mood. I can&#039;t ignore something that literally looses me games whether I pay any attention to it or not.","replies":[{"poster":"Revelstoke","date":"2016-12-22T11:24:29.361+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I agree wholeheartedly with your post, except for this.\n\n> [{quoted}](name=Xenoblade,realm=OCE,application-id=T8eq2lFQ,discussion-id=QFxTsRRh,comment-id=,timestamp=2016-12-19T20:01:45.666+0000)\n>\n> Now I&amp;#039;m obviously not blaming this on Riot, \n\n\n\nIt is riots fault, and will continue to be riots fault until they \nspend some money and give us the tools to do something\nabout feeders/trolls etc.\n\nThat or as you say there is some MASSIVE improvement \nto the reporting system.\n\nIn my opinion three years after removing tribunal,\nthey haven't delivered on anything apart from the \nnaughty word filter, which you know. was really solved\nwhen we got the mute button.\n\nHopefully these problems start hitting their bottom line\nbecause no amount of posts asking for them to do \nsomething about trolls and feeders seems to have\nspurred any action in.. yeah 3/4 years..","replies":[]},{"poster":"HumanbeastOM","date":"2017-01-25T00:41:37.373+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"bumping this.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Tele","date":"2016-12-19T23:48:35.431+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Unfortunately stuff like this does happen more often than it should :( \n\nThe report system it already doing a pretty good job in terms of punishments IMO.
