There are many fights that can&#039;t be won as easily or at all without the aid of wards or vision-granting abilities, but these aren&#039;t accurately represented by the awarding of assists. Maybe kills that take place within a certain proximity of a ward could grant an assist to the champion who placed that ward, for example. Since this granting of vision certainly aids in fights, I think it would be worthwhile providing assists to the vision-granters.\r\n\r\nSincerely, Jace.","replies":[{"poster":"aShinySquirtle","date":"2015-04-20T06:48:13.467+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Good point. Actually this made me think of something else. Scenario time!\n\nI'm being chased by four members of the enemy team, excluding their Teemo, in the jungle and I'm at 50 hp. I have the Raptor Vision buff up and I see that the only way I can keep going without turning back to fight is to step on a Teemo Shroom, although it'll take too long for me to destroy it. So instead, I turn back around and sacrifice myself to the chasing enemy team so that the four of them get the gold rather their entire team getting the gold.\n\nEven though Teemo didn't do any damage or aid in the fight in a way that's measurable, he still helped to secure the kill by blocking a narrow pathway with his mushroom. I'm not saying he should get the assist for this, but it's pretty clear that he was part of the reason that the kill occurred. Ain't too similar to giving assists for vision, but I think vision assists are a good idea logically.","replies":[]},{"poster":"JasonWazza","date":"2015-04-16T09:04:46.604+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"No this isn't a good idea, while the warding helps and could even be the main reason that the kill was gotten (finding someone out of place) the problem is too many of the assists this would provide would be for no good reason.\n\nHonestly supports get assists through stuns, snares, slows, adding extra ways to get assists actually hurts the support more then it helps (assist gold gets spread more thinly.)","replies":[{"poster":"JaceMC88","date":"2015-04-16T09:30:17.404+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"There are already existing ways to earn assists without actually assisting in a fight, and providing vision changes games more than most of those other ways do. I understand this whole topic is mostly an argument of opinions, but by neglecting the importance of the granting of vision in fights, the whole idea of warding is being devalued.

Warding is a responsibility of all laners and junglers, and vision granting abilities are all but restricted to marksmen.

Assists are defined as basically any action that aids in the winning of a fight or killing of a champion. Vision assists the winning of fights and meets all the requirements of what granting an assist needs, just as much as healing or dealing damage or providing crowd control also do. The only difference is that it isn't recognised as worthy of being considered in the game's statistics, which is definitely untrue. \n\nGold would be spread more widely as a result of this idea, but the change wouldn't be implemented for that reason; it'd just be a side-effect of it. I appreciate your input, but it's a fact that vision aids in fights, and a battle of opinions doesn't change the fact that a core aspect of the game is being neglected by in-game-statistics.","replies":[{"poster":"JasonWazza","date":"2015-04-17T11:08:58.637+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":">Vision assists the winning of fights and meets all the requirements of what granting an assist needs\n\n.\n\n>Just as much as healing or dealing damage or providing crowd control also do.\n\nCall me crazy, but healing, dealing damage or providing crowd control is a whole lot more then PLACING A FUCKING WARD.\n\nWant to half ass as a jungler?\n\nBuy a sightstone and ward all your lanes, right in the middle, free assists if your winning.\n\nWant to half ass as a support?\n\nGo mid and place a ward, don't even bother ganking properly, just ward.\n\n>that a core aspect of the game is being neglected by in-game-statistics.\n\nWards win games, therefore better warding = higher percentage of games won = an IN GAME STATISTIC.\n\nYour missing the whole purpose of this conversation, which is warding does matter, just because it isn't gold generating doesn't mean you have the right to whine that this isn't the case.\n\nMaybe as a support focus more on actually helping score kills then whatever the hell your doing, because clearly it's not actually assisting or you wouldn't be complaining.","replies":[{"poster":"JaceMC88","date":"2015-04-17T22:50:57.754+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"There are already ways to abuse the current sytem. Healing champions that are already at full health gives you an assist for something that didn't help in the fight at all. The point is that the majority of the time, vision assists in fights. What other criteria should there be for granting assists? Everything else that helps in fights currently grants an assist, so I don't see why vision should be left out.\n\nOf course there'd be people who would exploit this mechanic. Players who care more about their own score rather than contributing to the win will exist regardless of whether or not this feature is implemented. There are so many players who would throw out Thresh's lantern just before a kill occurs for the free assist, even if it means they can't use it to save an ally later. \n\nEvery mechanic in league of legends has the potential to be abused, but they still exist because their positive aspects outweigh the potential for abuse. This abuse would often only occur in lower ladder ranking and normal or custom matches anyway, since more experienced players rarely abuse the system for he sake of their own scores.","replies":[{"poster":"JasonWazza","date":"2015-04-18T08:05:16.419+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":">Healing champions that are already at full health gives you an assist for something that didn't help in the fight at all.\n\n*facedesk*\n\nThe difference being, that one can be done every 2 minutes, one can be done within a 10 second window where they are actually at least somewhere near the fight.\n\n>There are so many players who would throw out Thresh's lantern just before a kill occurs for the free assist, even if it means they can't use it to save an ally later. \n\nExcept that's still helpful to get them out from where they are chasing the champion, especially if your going by the premise it's not going to save an ally later.\n\nThe difference is this is WAY to easy to abuse for kills that your no where near earning assists on.\n\n>but they still exist because their positive aspects outweigh the potential for abuse.\n\nThe positives in NO WAY outweigh the abuse factor","replies":[{"poster":"JaceMC88","date":"2015-04-20T06:39:48.060+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You acknowledged that vision helps in some fights.
