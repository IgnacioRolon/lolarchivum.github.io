There are many fights that can&#039;t be won as easily or at all without the aid of wards or vision-granting abilities, but these aren&#039;t accurately represented by the awarding of assists. Maybe kills that take place within a certain proximity of a ward could grant an assist to the champion who placed that ward, for example. Since this granting of vision certainly aids in fights, I think it would be worthwhile providing assists to the vision-granters. \r\n\r\nSincerely, Jace.","replies":[{"poster":"HORSE OF FORCE","date":"2015-04-14T09:22:12.368+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"But what if you just place a ward in bot lane (like, right in the middle of the lane) right as a dragon fight is about to happen and get assists for it even though there was already vision?\n\nStupid example but this just shows how it can be exploited for extra gold for no reason.\n\nAlso how would you calculate the amount of gold rewarded? There's no damage value to multiply to get a reward.","replies":[{"poster":"JaceMC88","date":"2015-04-14T09:29:52.132+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"That's a fair point, but there are already ways to earn free assists and assist gold without entering fights. For example, you could heal a team member who is already at full health to earn an assist in a fight you weren't involved in. \n\nMaybe providing vision could grant a flat amount of gold rather than scaling it based on a variable, or maybe the amount of gold granted could increase as the game progresses. I just figured that since vision is such an integral part of the game, it should be officially recognised by in-game statistics.","replies":[{"poster":"HORSE OF FORCE","date":"2015-04-15T12:31:13.315+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"That actually makes a lot of sense.\n\nThere's arguably the fact that sometimes getting vision of an enemy doesn't always assist your team in killing them, but giving incentive for people to ward up and providing tangible rewards for it will probably be very beneficial for the state of the game.\n\nHave you tried posting this in [Player Creations](http://boards.oce.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/player-creations)?","replies":[{"poster":"JaceMC88","date":"2015-04-15T13:06:19.848+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I realised this probably wasn't the right spot to post this, you're right.
