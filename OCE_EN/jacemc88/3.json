I wasn't watching him after that, but Tibbers teleported back to me (assumingly because he went out of range), and I saw the animation of Xin Zhao's ultimate appear over Tibbers which killed me as well as Tibbers, although I was nowhere close to Xin Zhao. I'm guessing that area-of-effect spells that hit Tibbers just before he teleports back to Annie will also hit Annie. Is this intentional or is it a bug?","replies":[{"poster":"JaceMC88","date":"2015-04-11T21:11:08.496+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I didn't unfortunately.","replies":[]},{"poster":"HORSE OF FORCE","date":"2015-01-21T06:42:15.339+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"http://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/bug-report\n\nDid you record it?","replies":[]}]}
