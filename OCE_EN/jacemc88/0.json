Some days it could rain, making the river&#039;s water level a little higher and causing it to spill over into the lanes a bit and making bigger splashes while trekking through it. Melee minions could hold little umbrellas instead of their swords for a little charismatic appeal. The sun could shine more intensely on other days, giving off glints of light that reflect off of the edges of towers and minion weapons, while the river glows with a reflective yellow hue and the jungle monsters suffer from sunburn. The wind could pick up during other days, blowing against the grass in lanes and the jungle and making little waves in the river, and maybe we could see some tumbleweed action. Heck, let it hail as well! I&#039;d imagine weather as an aesthetic addition could be awesome!\r\n\r\n~ Jace","replies":[{"poster":"WEETBIX 4 BREKKI","date":"2015-04-20T06:10:17.483+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Mostly because weather effects would reduce clarity which can disturb gameplay, that's why the art style is the way it is, so the champions / spells are always the focal point of the action.","replies":[{"poster":"EzeBlood","date":"2015-04-23T07:23:28.331+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"DOTA 2 has constant rain, a day/night cycle, and still everything is as clear as crystal on such a chaotic display.
