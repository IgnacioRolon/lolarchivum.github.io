That grammar. No.\n\n2. Yes, you may be able to beat Plats in Normals, but even I can do that (and I'm Bronze V). That's because Normals aren't as try-hard as Ranked. I would suggest you play 30-50 Ranked games (10 for the placements, and the rest to help adjust to a Rank more true to your skill level). If you end up in high Gold or somewhere in Plat, then your assumption is valid, but you're just as likely to end up in Silver or Bronze as well. \n\n3. Focus on your studies. I know you're not interested in studying science, but there are plenty of other options. Most jobs (or jobs that will give you decent earnings), require a degree. If your pro player dream falls through, you will need a back-up plan. Also, just because you're studying doesn't mean you still can't play. You can still play LoL for several hours in the evening.\n\nHowever, many people regret not following their dreams. If you are truly passionate about being a Pro player (not just saying you want to be one) then you need to be willing to prove your parents, the replies to this post, and society wrong and *work hard*. No pro is where they are without hard work. A girl I went to school with has no arms, but wanted to be a pro swimmer. What did she do? She trained for years with specialised coaches and spent hours before and after school, as well as her weekends/holidays, practicing. You know what happened to her? She became a Paralympic swimmer at the age of 14, and got Silvers and Bronzes at the World Championships and Pacific Championships.\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nIf you want to put in the effort to go Pro, here are some things to follow:\n\n1. If you land in Bronze/Silver, *get coaching immediately*. You want to get to AT LEAST high Plat/Diamond as quickly as possible if you want even a remote chance to go Pro, and coaching is the most effective way to do that (provided you apply what you learn). If you land in Gold/Plat, good on you. You will still need coaching, but this will be more in-depth stuff.\n\n2. Once you're mid-Plat/Diamond, start looking for a minor team. You will most likely be able to find these on the Boards. These teams will help you improve your skills in a team environment (a must for Pros). You will also receive team-orientated coaching for free (if an actual minor team, not a group of friends).\n\n3. Look for Official Riot tournaments (can be found on Battle.fy or in particular regions). You want the Official Tournaments over just Discord/Friendly Tournaments for one main reason: exposure. Official Tournaments will likely be streamed on Twitch, where other players will get to see you in action. There may even be recruiters or scouts watching, and looking at those with potential. Here in OCE, we have the OOL (Oceanic Open Ladder). I'm not sure if EUW have something similar, but it's a Riot Tournament open to all teams, with the team coming first place given a chance to qualify for the OCS, the Challenger Series.\n\n4. At around Diamond level, you would want to consider part-time streaming. This will give you more exposure than just Tournaments, and give you practice for when you go Pro (since Pros earn a substantial amount from streaming, not just winning games).\n\n5. Naturally, your eventual goal is to get to Master/Challenger Tier, or else not even the EUW Challenger Series would consider you, let alone the EUW LCS. You would need a professional coach to get this far, so save up A LOT and either contact pro coaches or pro players. Some good coaches would be Danyon Togia, LS, and Wickd. I mention a lot of money because one session won't cut it. You will need quite a few. *In fact, LS even offers a 6-month in-person coaching with him in Korea*. Just let one of his Mods know in chat, and they will provide you with info and help set up accommodation. **But you need to be REALLY dedicated for this**.\n\n6. Once you're high Master/Challenger, try getting into the Challenger Series. For Oceania, this is basically winning the OOL, but may be different for different regions. I believe you need to be in a team of Masters and Challengers, and attempt to qualify by beating a relegation team (but not sure about this).\n\n7. Once you're in the Challenger Series, you will be getting lots of exposure and attention. Scouts from LCS will notice you, and may recruit you as a sub or even as a replacement. You could even win the Challenger Series and move up into the LCS (although you would need to be amazing, since there is a big difference between Challenger teams and Pro teams).\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nHowever, you also sometimes need to know your limits, and realise some dreams aren't attainable.\n\n**But that doesn't mean you can't slightly alter your dreams!!!** If you really want to be in the eSports scene, but don't have the skills to be a pro player, then perhaps study business and set up your own eSports organisation and get others to play for your team. Or perhaps study sport analysis, become a Twitch Commentator for lesser tournaments, and later move on to Pro eSports. Management could also be good, leading you to become the manager for a team. Art could make you a logo designer or the designer of a team's merchandise. Studying film could make you the Editor for an eSports team.\n\n*Sometimes we can achieve our dreams a different way*.\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nWhatever happens, I hope this helps, and I wish you the best of luck :D\n{{sticker:slayer-jinx-wink}}","replies":[{"poster":"LuckLilBoy","date":"2017-09-07T11:39:37.173+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"You Actually Helped Me Alot Many Thanks !!","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"I Stealth I","date":"2017-09-07T00:01:22.284+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Never disregard your studies.
