I can reproduce it 100% of the time. In any game of league if someone in my house scrolls through Facebook it will disconnect me from the league server. This never used to happen, started about a month ago. I can have a stream going while playing or people downloading in the house, but as soon as someone loads Facebook its a disconnect.","replies":[{"poster":"Mindstar","date":"2015-11-03T01:35:56.897+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey,\n\nSounds like a frustrating issue.  What kind of set up do you have in your house to access the net?  Do you all connect via wifi? network cables?  Are there any special filtering/Quality of Service settings that might be enabled on your router?\n\nHere are a few resources you might find handy for troubleshooting it a bit further:\n\n* [Troubleshooting Connection Issues](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues) on the support site will give you a whole load of settings and things to check over to make sure your PC is set up optimally.\n* You can use [Logs of Lag](http://logsoflag.com/) to check over individual game logs where you've experienced reconnects.  It will give you a picture of the overall stability of your connection throughout a game of League.\n* You can run a [trace route](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752674-Network-System-and-League-of-Legends-Logs#wq2) to 103.240.227.1 to check the path between you and the league servers for any abnormalities.\n\nLet me know how things go!\nCheers\nMindstar","replies":[{"poster":"ChronoFalcon","date":"2015-11-03T06:57:56.984+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"We have two routers, a main one and then one that comes into my room which myself and my girlfriend play off. Connecting to either router causes the DC when a computer connected to either router loads facebook. No QoS enabled on either router, all ethernet only one laptop using wifi to connect to the network (does not play league).\n\nUsed lots of lag, we did a test game and extreme packet loss on out network whenever facebook is loaded. Lots of lag says our network is bad. Any other website like twitch or using a torrent doesn't cause any packet loss. Seriously seems to only be Facebook.\n\nTracerout shows no abnormalities between here and the riot servers, unless facebook loads while performing the trace rout. Really weird issue that only started a little while ago, with nothing changed to the network.","replies":[]}]}]}
