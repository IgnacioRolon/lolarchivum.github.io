She wasn&rsquo;t having it today. Even the vibrant, stellar hues of the cloudy galaxy freckled with golden stars became a meagrely dull view for Jinx.\r\nSpringing out of the chair and sliding down the cockpit ladder, the quirky orange-haired girl made a beeline for the workshop. Without much warning, she pounces onto her buddy who was contently crafting little origami figures of the Morning Star crew. \r\n\r\n_Was._\r\n\r\n&ldquo;Ohhhh heya Malph!!&rdquo; Jinx exclaims with her signature toothy grin, arms hugging an armoured shoulder of her bestie. Malphite, who would otherwise have playfully acknowledged the pilot&rsquo;s outbursts of fun to sate her boredom (which happened often), bellied a deep growl of irritation. The tiny paper figurine of Yasuo had crushed between the big guy&rsquo;s lazuline fingers from Jinx&rsquo;s impact.\r\n\r\n&ldquo;Oh man, it&rsquo;s good to get out of that hell hole up there.&rdquo; The pilot laughed and skipped to the other side of the room, swinging her orange braid as she picked up a can of Quasar Pop from the mini-fridge. &ldquo;I could _really_ go for &lsquo;sploding some stuff up, though.&rdquo;\r\nMalphite shifted his colossal weight in his swivel chair to turn to Jinx, taking her by surprise. Inches from her face, he glares angrily into her widened, teal eyes all the while holding the squashed captain in his palm.\r\n\r\n&ldquo;Go. Away.&rdquo;\r\n\r\nJinx&rsquo;s stomach fell. Malphite spun back around to the table and set to work on a new paper Yasuo without another word, leaving the girl to stand there in utter confusion.\r\n\r\n&ldquo;Wha&hellip;What?&rdquo; Jinx laughed nervously. &ldquo;You serious, Malph? I didn&rsquo;t-&hellip;! Aww, come onn!&rdquo; She got not a word in return. A pang of guilt stabbed her when she realised he was definitely still mad at her from a certain string of ill-bred words said during a &lsquo;civil&rsquo; team game of Mechs vs. Space Monsters last week.\r\n\r\nFrowning, Jinx cracked open the can and took an angry sip as she stomped down the corridor that led out to the common room. \r\n_\r\n~ I can&rsquo;t understand, no, I can&rsquo;t understand,\r\nHow life goes on the way it does, ~_\r\n\r\nThe all too familiar tune of Yasuo&rsquo;s favourite song irritated her the closer she got. There was a clear reason why the fairy lights illuminating the room had been set to a pink hue.\r\n\r\nThe Morning Star&rsquo;s captain glided in the moody glow with one of Jinx&rsquo;s test dummies in a ballroom hold, serenading the Skeeter Davis lyrics to it. _Not_ to Jinx&rsquo;s surprise was Sona sitting attentively, watching Yasuo&rsquo;s performance, smiling like she doesn&rsquo;t when anyone else is around. A bitterness soured the pilot&rsquo;s mouth, and it wasn&rsquo;t from the kelpfruit compote she had eaten earlier. Her augmented hand subconsciously began to crush the soda can, but by the time she noticed, the glistening purple fizz had become a puddle beneath her boot. Yasuo had danced through a verse and a half before the cursing Jinx caught his attention. Eyes rolled in annoyance.\r\n\r\n&ldquo;Thought you were on the wheel, Jinx.&rdquo; \r\n\r\nPiloting the cruiser was fun when Malphite accompanies her in the cockpit, even more so when Yasuo occasionally jumps to join in on belly-bursting storytimes or a game of interstellar blackjack. But as soon as the Moon Wizard was taken aboard, Jinx can&rsquo;t stay in the pilot seat for more than five minutes without getting bored and lonesome.\r\n_\r\n~ Why do these eyes of mine cry? ~_\r\n\r\n&ldquo;Does it look like I am, Cap&#039;n?&rdquo; She scoffed as she walks over to the kitchen.\r\n\r\nYasuo sighed. &ldquo;Argh&hellip;I told you, we _have_ to be at Aumia on time.&rdquo; \r\n\r\n&ldquo;_Aumia_?&rdquo; Jinx&rsquo;s brow had narrowed in disbelief. She let the can fall into the garbage disposal. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re en route to Oratha! Ya know, _Kayn&rsquo;s_ planet &ndash; the guy who&rsquo;s trying to take over the Goddamn galaxy!&rdquo;\r\n\r\nThe captain brushed strands of photon-bleached hair from his face, exposing an intimidating scowl and the scar that marked his last confrontation with the shadow reaper. &ldquo;Change of plans, we need to refuel.&rdquo;\r\n\r\nJinx slapped a metal wall. &ldquo;She&rsquo;s fuelled to the brim.&rdquo;\r\n\r\n&ldquo;The energy-capacitors-&ldquo; \r\n\r\n&ldquo;Repaired the plugs this mornin&rsquo;.&rdquo;\r\n\r\n&ldquo;The-&ldquo;\r\n\r\n&ldquo;Unclogged it, and damn you _really_ need to ease up on the horse-chicken nuggets.&rdquo;\r\n\r\nYasuo glared unimpressed; Jinx returning the fierce stare. Her eyes caught on Sona&rsquo;s before switching back to Yasuo&rsquo;s, and everything she had observed since the Templar&rsquo;s arrival suddenly clicked.\r\n&ldquo;Ohhh, _ohhhh_! I know why you why wanna go to Aumia!&rdquo; Yasuo became uneasy. &ldquo;And why you hang out with _her_ all the time! It&rsquo;s all so clear now!&rdquo; The grin that was carved on her face was so menacing it didn&rsquo;t even look right on her. Psychotic eyes trapped the captain. &ldquo;Did she tell you that your brother is there?&rdquo;\r\n\r\nYasuo&rsquo;s heart sunk. \r\n\r\n&ldquo;J-Jinx.&rdquo; His voice became wobbly but sported a deep, infuriated tone Jinx had never heard before. &ldquo;You are the pilot, you follow my orders, I. Am. Your. Captain!&rdquo;\r\n\r\n_~ Don&rsquo;t they know, it&rsquo;s the end of the world, ~_\r\n\r\n&ldquo;No,&rdquo; Jinx said lowly, &ldquo;if you&rsquo;re picking your dead brother over the fate of the universe, then you&rsquo;re a poor excuse for a captain.&rdquo;\r\n\r\nThe words echoed lonely in the silence between them.\r\n\r\n_~ It ended when you said&hellip;goodbye. ~_\r\n________________________________________\r\n\r\nThe last of the missiles launched from the ship and exploded among armies of mutated rhinodons, but it proved no use. The Morning Star crew had landed on Aumia mere moments ago yet their efforts to push back the surprise horde were in vain. There was no communication, no coordination. Even the Yasuo-Malphite wombo did next to nothing. Jinx was split off from the others, relying upon Pow-Pow&rsquo;s bullets to shred through the beasts, but she only had so many.\r\n\r\n&ldquo;Shit!&rdquo; \r\n\r\nWhile she fumbled her belt trying to grab hold of Zapper, a matriarch was stampeding right at her. She aimed the plasma gun, but it was too late. Within a second, Jinx was laying on the goo-stained soil in agonising pain with possibly the need for new ribs.\r\n\r\nFor the first time ever, she didn&rsquo;t enjoy the violence.\r\n\r\nThe beast approaching to finish her off was blurry in her eyes. Without mercy, it raised itself on its hind legs like a stallion before it&rsquo;s clawed soles began plummeting down towards her. Jinx squeezed her eyes, cherished memories of the crew flashing before her. _This is it_, she thought. But death never came. The red she saw through her eyelids turned to blinding white. A beautiful hymn reached a crescendo, reducing the shrieking sounds of the beasts to nothing. Jinx squinted her eyes, adjusting to the beauteous light that gleamed from a figure. _An angel? _\r\n\r\n&ldquo;Sona!&rdquo; \r\n\r\nThe Templar&rsquo;s golden orbs shone happily. She played an angelic aria that cascaded upon Jinx&rsquo;s body, mending her wounds before giving her a hand up. Jinx was full of gratitude _and_ disbelief that Sona was actually good on the battlefield. &ldquo;Thank you.&rdquo; The Templar nodded with a smile before gliding over to Malphite to heal cracks in his carapace. The battlefield now lay silent. The crystals upon the rhinodons&rsquo; backs shimmered the light of Aumia&rsquo;s moon. It was beautifully quiet until grunts of struggle echoed through silence. Jinx&rsquo;s head snapped to see a helpless Yasuo trying to punch off a baby rhinodon that was lightly gnawing on his arm. A smirk curled on her lips.\r\n\r\n&ldquo;Well well _well_,&rdquo; the pilot chuckled as she walked up to the captain.\r\n\r\n&ldquo;Get this thing off me!&rdquo; Yasuo spat through gritted teeth.\r\n\r\nJinx&rsquo;s smile faded as she prepared herself for her next words. &ldquo;Not until you promise to never ditch me and Malph again,&rdquo; She muttered.\r\nThe captain gave her a confused look. &ldquo;_Promise?_&rdquo;\r\n\r\nThe rhinodon collapsed onto the ground in spasms as plasma energy jittered on its skin before it stopped moving. Jinx shoved Zapper back into her belt. \r\n\r\nWith a brave, deep breath:\r\n&ldquo;EversinceSonacameIgotreallylonelybecauseyouweren&rsquo;thangingoutwithmeandMalphanymoreandwemissedyouhencewhyIgotreallyangryatyoubutIsincerlyapologiseforitnowandIwantyoutocomebacktohangingoutwithusagainplease.&rdquo;\r\n\r\nShe darted her eyes away and crossed her arms, hoping Yasuo didn&rsquo;t understand any of her apology so he wouldn&rsquo;t hold it over her head. Silence lingered between the two before the captain let out a signature chuckle. Jinx didn&rsquo;t have time to react when Yasuo pulled her into a friendly embrace, resting his stubbled chin on her ear.\r\n\r\n&ldquo;_Apologyaccepted._&rdquo; He mockingly whispered.\r\nPulling back, the two exchange grins that reassured them of a rebuilt bond.\r\n\r\n&ldquo;So, trusty pilot, down to kick some edgy space Emperor ass?&rdquo; \r\n\r\nJinx&rsquo;s toothy smile grew ear to ear.\r\n\r\n&ldquo;Aye aye, Captain.&rdquo;\r\n________________________________________\r\n\r\nThe eager crew sat comfortably gathered in the cockpit right beside Jinx, watching her tap holographic screens excitedly until &lsquo;travelling to: Oratha&rsquo; appeared on a monitor. Reclining back in the pilot chair for a long journey, Jinx lightly punches the now duct taped wall. She smiled at not just her crew, but her friends.\r\n\r\n&ldquo;Celesta, play Odyssey theme song.&rdquo;","replies":[]}
