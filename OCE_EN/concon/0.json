I wont deny that I used to flame and blame everyone else for my mistakes. During the pre season i worked on my emotional state and i became a better player. Realising my own mistake etc.\r\n\r\nSo thinking i was good enough i went into the placements really early. I was doing well with 7 ranked wins in a row. And then i lost 2 but won the last one. But after all the effort and the good scores, i got back to b5.....really.....riot....wtf\r\n\r\nCan someone please explain, i need an explanation to what happened. Was it my MMR? Was it because i was in b5 in s5????? \r\nIf anyone could help me out that would be great. Thank you.","replies":[{"poster":"Diddeh Kong","date":"2016-01-21T08:54:24.980+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Well it depends on your MMR, and if you were at b5 but losing alot of games, then ur MMR wouldve been really low, so getting that placement would be normal, but if you were high MMR for a bronze 5, which is rare, because it is the lowest tier possible, then u shouldve been a bit higher say b4-2. However, now that you have won 8-2 you should be winning a great amount of LP per game (highest is 40 per game), unless ur mmr was really bad last season.","replies":[{"poster":"ConCon","date":"2016-01-21T13:45:05.135+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Ah right.

If you have seriously worked on your attitude and skill (which I think is awesome btw) then you should have no problem climbing! It's pretty rare to get placed at a higher rank than you were in the previous season, even winning 10/10 games. So just accept it, it sucks, but you're gonna  climb to Plat and beyond now, it'll just take an **extra** couple days ;) ! \n^_^","replies":[{"poster":"ConCon","date":"2016-01-22T02:35:48.246+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thank you!
