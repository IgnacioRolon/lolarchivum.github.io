Surely im not the only one who has seen a whole team get destroyed by a single Volibear? He actually ruins the game for me","replies":[{"poster":"A Coiled Viper","date":"2015-05-05T10:41:29.798+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Voli in my opinion is far from needing a nerf. If anything he needs a rework.\n\nThere is a reason why he sees no professional play. There are simply champs that do things better then what he does.\n\nWant a flinging aoe damage tank? try Singed. Want a raw health building monster with peel? try Mundo or sion.\nNeed a strong engage? Try malphite or sejuani.\n\nHe fills very little specific need in the game atm for the reasons listed above.\n\nHis biggest problem is always going to be getting into the middle of the team in the first place. He is easily kited with slows and roots and has no jumps he simply runs at the enemy.\n\nAlso take into account that his bite is his only real damage source when his ult isnt running, It has a monstrous cooldown for a W ability and for it to be most effective the enemy must be on low health.....\n\nThat being said if he does get into your team he can make a mess but its easy enough to prevent him from doing so.\n\nI call for a rework\n\nAs my first ever champ the last thing he needs right now is to be nerfed out of existence forever.","replies":[]},{"poster":"SEKAI","date":"2015-05-04T10:28:47.126+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Ignite is your friend and Morello is what your need, run a couple of grievous wound champ if you must too.\n\nThere is always BotRK and LW that makes life easier also.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Jink","date":"2015-05-04T09:36:03.016+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Warmogs is 800 bonus Health so he gains 240 damage to his bite by building it because it gains 30% bonus damage from bonus HP built. Plus his bite does 1% bonus damage for each 1% HP the enemy is missing so if you are missing 50% Health it's 50% bonus damage to it's base, plus the bonus 240 so he'll bite you for like 800-1000 health if you are an ADC with about 1700 health but missing half (That's before resistances).","replies":[]}]}
