I have tried submitting a ticket and provided as much information as I can but the information I had provided was rejected. I have spent over a hundred dollars on the account and have spent several years playing on it and would really like it back. Is there any chance I could find out the email that was bounded to the account in order to try and recover that email address which then I can recover my password.\r\n\r\nKind regards,\r\n\r\nSpirit Kush.","replies":[{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2018-01-02T10:18:38.281+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The only thing you can do is follow the account recovery process (which would have been the whole bunch of info they asked for). If they can't verify ownership of the account then they cannot return it to you.\n\nThe list of questions the give you is ultimately just a guide. Basically they are looking for any info that is unique to the account but not visible on it. So for example, a list of skins is not helpful since you can see it on the account, but something like \"I bought Firefighter Tristana in the week of it's release\" would be, since it's not something that's in the purchase history.\n\nTry remembering things linked to other info, like if you were super excited for X champion to come out and you bought them day one, or if you're the kind of player that bought every champion on day one. Maybe you have transferred regions at some point and remember roughly when. Maybe you have played regularly from two different locations. Hopefully you get the idea.\n\nThe more info you can give them the better, but there's no way they're going to give you the account if they can't be sure it's actually yours.","replies":[]}]}
