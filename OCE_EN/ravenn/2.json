Championship Riven should be re-released at its original price with none of this other rubbish that people are suggesting it like only selling or giving it to those with mastery points on her. however something special e.g a border for existing owners of the skin would be appropriate, perhaps an icon too?\r\n_\r\nA skin is a skin, it&#039;s there to be used and appreciated, Why restrict people being able to appreciate something they love._","replies":[]}
