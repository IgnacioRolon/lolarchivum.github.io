Because of champions like Le Blanc, Syndra, Veigar and more. I was thinking maybe DFG could be a click item so instead of having it a targetable item its like a self power up with will empower your next ability like Heimerdingers ulti which would make it somewhat a i need to think of combinations before jumping in. Which seems fair as it wont allow all abilities to do stupid amounts of damage (Just one :P) IDK i like the item seems fair and not as OP as DFG","replies":[{"poster":"Maraudaur","date":"2015-01-16T04:53:15.724+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"\"The biggest change we're making in 5.2 is that we're removing Deathfire Grasp from Summoner's Rift. There are two major reasons we felt we had to do this, so I'll run through both:\n\nFirst, DFG tends to make burst patterns even more bursty. The item effectively adds another nuke spell on top of kits that are already designed to have strong up-front damage and aggravates the \"whoa, I got one shot out of nowhere\" frustration of playing against certain champions. A good example is LeBlanc; DFG adds reliability to her assassination patterns and ends up removing counterplay (she gets to rely on her Q, E, and DFG spells for damage, and can use dashes to reposition or escape instead of making more risky plays).\n\nThe second reason is strongly tied to the first; removing this item gives us room to buff champion kits that would otherwise be overpowered if they could use DFG. The most obvious example is Ahri; more 'magey' elements of the character, like her sustained damage or kiting, end up getting washed out because she has so much power to blow up charmed targets with a DFG burst. This ends up forcing us to balance Ahri around her assassin playstyle because there's always the \"I can buy DFG\" route to consider; removing the item means we can buff her in more interesting ways while still keeping some of her burst because she can't just pick up a DFG and double down on a single playstyle.\"\n\nRiot Jag\n\nI'm not an expert on the topic but here are my thoughts on your item, especially in reference to why we removed DFG.\n\nYou propose an Item that when cast buffs your next spell cast. I feel like this is definitely an interesting concept, but I don't think it would do what we are looking for. You would just be replacing {{item:3128}} with a weaker version of itself. Maybe after testing a weaker {{item:3128}}  is what we need but for now the plan is to remove the DFG like item so that we can look to buff champions in interesting ways.\n\nLet's take Ahri for example, her kit includes a lot of damage, mobility, and sustain. Right now she is always played as assassin, with DFG being a first buy most of the time. If we try to buff Ahri to try make her mobility or cooldowns or sustain damage better we would just be making a stronger assassin Ahri as she would just get the buffs and still buy DFG.\n\nBut if we take away DFG, we can look to buff Ahri in those other categories (mobility, sustain, cooldowns) without worrying about just making an ultra low CD, high sustain, high mobility **assassin**. Ahri could be this high mobility/sustain **mage** thats focused on getting off multiple rotations of her spells. (I.e. using ult and getting in 2 or 3 rotations of Q)\n\nWhat do you think?","replies":[{"poster":"Deadspec","date":"2015-01-16T08:18:14.186+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I trust you guys know what your doing  plus new items are always fun who knows what will happen once its gone","replies":[]},{"poster":"HORSE OF FORCE","date":"2015-01-23T11:18:49.436+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":">with DFG being a first buy most of the time\n\npls rito man i build ahri as tank, dfg is useless on her\n\nBut the main reason you wanted to remove DFG is to remove the \"omg one shot and no counterplay\" it introduces. I think this proposed DFG replacement is perfect, as it's not as 100% guaranteed as the original DFG.\n\nWith the example of Ahri you just used, if you active DFG and then fire Charm, the bonus damage would be almost nothing, as Charm (as of patch 5.1) doesn't do much damage. She'd have to time it correctly to make it enhance her Orb, which is what deals the most damage. This introduces a skill requirement, an inconsistency, which can be played against (with CC at the right time) and reduces the consistency of it.\n\nPlus, I really like its stats, because of the CDR and raw Ability Power. The perfect compliment to my Syndra build.\n\nI'm really for this idea.","replies":[]},{"poster":"whos your dade","date":"2015-01-16T05:28:10.589+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"i do agree in some of the things you said, yes i agree that {{item:3128}} is a tad OP (Well really op). like most things a change can be just enough to keep things in balance like my proposal. buffing champs then nerfing then buffing is just a pain (no offence knowing riot they will buff to hard then not enough then buff again and never find a good balance  ie khz zix) which just seems like a hassle. items like {{item:3128}} can be game changers yes atm {{item:3128}} is way to strong as it stay on for 4 second and being able to make all abilities 20% stronger is a pain when you have a 1000ap veigar walking around. but with my idea you have room for error and makes the game more difficult mechanically and game sense. I don't know ive just used DFG with syndra and veigar heaps and i personally think it is op, my proposal seems like a good compromise. But once again i don't own RIOT and im not even a developer even though i have had some good ideas in the past which i never thought of posting.

Then this doesn't have to be used to burst people either. Imagine, it could be used for defensive spells too, allowing your team's Karma or Lux to just throw down a super strong shield for all of her teammates. Also, it could allow for some AoE damage spells to do extra damage all around.","replies":[{"poster":"whos your dade","date":"2015-01-17T05:32:38.002+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hi I've updated what my idea originally is the item works exactly like dfg it's a click on target item as empowered kart ulti  sounds a tad op it works by the first ability to either be targeted on the champion or the first ability to hit the champion works out a bit better it's like kats bouncing blades leave the target marked and the first ability will proc it to do extra damage","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Pemi","date":"2015-01-16T04:18:52.194+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"That is actually a great idea.
