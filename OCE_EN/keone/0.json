I was wondering what the rules are on changing the in-game voices, champions, announcer, etc to another language such as Korean or Japanese. I understand Riot&#039;s rules against using 3rd party programs but am I still able to get banned if I change the voice files manually?\r\n\r\nIf this is fully legal, does anyone have a reliable way to get those files?\r\n\r\nThanks so much for you help,\r\n\r\n-Revan","replies":[{"poster":"Mortis Ex","date":"2017-05-01T00:43:18.208+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Im pretty sure I read that changing sound files counts as modification to the game and files which counts as cheating as far as riot is concerned.\nI think this was in a discussion about things like Eves little sound she makes when an enemy is in range. Its a quiet blip but some people replace the file with a louder BEEP to make it a lot more obvious.\n\nEdit. \nBut then they condone 3rd party skin programs like ultimate skin installer which replace game files. Or at least used to. Idk.","replies":[]}]}
