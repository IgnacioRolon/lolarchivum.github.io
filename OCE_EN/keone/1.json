Another one got auto positioned to support so apparently the solution was they both just insta lock my Mid.\r\n\r\nI have to dodge because the whole lobby just gets toxic and people troll pick champs etc etc and I&#039;m the one who is punished with -3LP for the dodge and a 5 minute Queue cooldown while they are free to Queue again and again doing this in every lobby.\r\n\r\nI know I&#039;m not the only one who comes across this but to my understanding there is no way of actually fixing the problem at the moment without an in lobby report system. Hopefully Riot is working on one.","replies":[{"poster":"The White Hatter","date":"2017-01-19T07:29:25.291+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I feel you, I keep getting people that just selects other positions than the ones they play because \"it's less waiting time\" which then in turn makes people swap positions to something they don't know how to play or just trolling - no one wants to dodge queue and whenever i can't afford to lose much LP I just dodge and cope with the ban and small loss of LP... a bit unfair, especially when you have to do it twice in a row....","replies":[]},{"poster":"Neosinf","date":"2017-01-12T10:20:12.920+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"SOLUTION\n\nYOU PLAY ARAM\n\nNOW EVERYONE IS MID LANE\n\n\nAnyway, those guys were desperate enough to steal your role, so they were probably noobs facing demotion. You'd have lost. It'd have been a 25min ragefest with -25lp.

While i get all that stuff is fun, Ziggs is still the strongest \"adc\" and poppy still hits someone on a  double detonated Q for 14% of their max health while shes full tank. Riot are focussing on all the wrong things, and they know it, they just dont care","replies":[]}]}
