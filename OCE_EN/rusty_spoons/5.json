Only reply I got from my ticket was a bot copy and paste reply yet they are accusing me of botting. So does the ban mean until next year or 9002? This is really unfair tbh","replies":[{"poster":"Wuks","date":"2016-08-15T21:34:20.787+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Rusty Spoons,realm=OCE,application-id=ElA0rvVL,discussion-id=IIdQYplh,comment-id=00000000,timestamp=2016-08-15T09:29:36.966+0000)\n>\n> Yeah I am still unclear since this was a first offense case.

Riot has a zero tolerance policy with regards to scripting, as it's clear that inherent and unfair gameplay advantages are extremely harmful for competitive and fun play.","replies":[]}]}]}]}
