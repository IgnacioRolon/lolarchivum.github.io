If not, I am creating a custom champion that as the league community we will pitch to Riot themselves and try to get them involved. I have a writer for the lore sorted already, I need someone who can create a 3D model and possible abilities in 3D also. I will be handling the VO side of things, like finding a voice actor for the character and voice editing. And finally an artist for the splash art. If you guys have any past experience in these fields feel free to post previous work of yours in the comments. I can&#039;t share much info on the champion itself at this moment but once I get the development team together we will bring updates every month or so. If anyone here would like to be a part of the team, feel free to let me know in the comments.
