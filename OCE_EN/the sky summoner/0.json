No\n\nI have legitimately had a tryndamere dive me under fountain, kill me and survive because of that bs ult.

It's just the nature of lane bullies, go big or go home, sink or swim. If tryndamere was still strong when behind we'd start having issues.\n\nAlso I call bull on the if you build super tank thing, since I know for a fact that as a fed 5k hp lategame super tank sion (with a titanic hydra, sunfire, randulins, deadmans, thornmail and merc treads) I got murderised in seconds with just a few aas by a jungle tryndamere who was sporting a Blue Smite Warrior, Static Shiv, Infinite Edge, Last Whisper and Beserkers Greaves. Whilst I was under tower.\n\nNow I guess shaco can deal with tryndacrit as a shaco main I can confirm that it's possible if you have a bit of experience and if the tryndamere doesn't just run away when the fight begins to look bad and keeping him locked down with cc also works pretty well but it takes alot of resources to kill a tryndamere and he's very snowbally. A good Teemo can also keep tryndamere in check very well if teemo goes full dps but I mean how often do you see an amazing teemo?\n\nI'm not saying tryndamere is broken, but he is certainly still powerful, especially in soloq when team coordination is not exactly at it's finest and junglers tend to feed the top lane tryndamere even when you tell them to stop coming top. Also it's not exactly fun when a tryndamere aa's you and you lose 60% of your hp with 1 hit and you can't just burst him because he pops his ult and either finishes critting you to chowder or spins away with so very little hp.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Requiemsfire","date":"2016-10-06T17:05:19.221+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yeaah ummm, when tryndamere is strong he becomes very hard to deal with. First off he has a 35% crit chance with max rage who transitions into a lategame carry who can literally duel anyone. You have to nearly kill him to pop his ult , and even then you have to be careful for another 3 seconds because he can still melt you and heal himself with life steal from items he built.. He's mobile, has inbuilt sustain, has a conditional slow when you try to run,  with an AD steroid. \n\n","replies":[{"poster":"KawtYouNow","date":"2016-10-06T20:10:35.512+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"i suggest you play him in the jungle, this would mean you wouldn't have to put up with an annoying lane bully and you can use your e i think to spin into lanes and get an ez kill. relax.","replies":[]}]}]}
