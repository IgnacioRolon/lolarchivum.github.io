Leona is a tanky-burst-initiator with CC (stuns for DAYS), while Sona is a fragile stick with the poke equal to being run over by a train the first few levels (Power Chord Q), then transitions to semi-mage as the game progresses.\nIf you want a competitively viable support, then pick Leona. If you prefer poke lanes over kill lanes, pick Sona.\nIf you want the best support for you, play both of them and see which one you like better.\nMY personal preference is Leona, because 9/10 times no one on your team plays tank. Not only that, but there are very few circumstances where I feel she is not useful; if you're not useful in lane (e.g. vs Zyra you can't do anything), you're useful in teamfights (low CD stun, root, and an AoE stun).\n\nEDIT: Just re-read your post and saw you suck at Thresh. Do you suck at him because you can't land hooks or because you don't know your role as a tanky support?\nIf you suck at hooks, then Leona is a lot more forgiving as her E passes through minions (so you can get to champs behind them). If you suck at melee champs in general, then I'd suggest Sona. If you suck at tanky supports, Leona is one of the more beginner friendly ones, so long as you know when to engage the enemy team.\nSorry about the long post, I just thought I'd be thorough with my explanation so you can make the decision right for you.

Sona is a poke-based support, and is good against other AP support like Annie, Janna, or Nami. She's my favorite.\nOn the other hand, Leona is more of an aggressive, get in your face kind of Support. She's good against Sona, in fact her main counter.\n\nIt's up to you whether you like aggressive playstyle or poking and be on the safer side. It also depends on the ADC picked. For a more overall support choice, I'd say Leona is a bit better. It is also easier to play than Sona, because she's super squishy and wrong positioning will land the other team first blood.","replies":[{"poster":"Firebolt","date":"2015-02-14T07:34:42.182+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Much better explanation than my 10 minute one :P","replies":[]}]}]}
