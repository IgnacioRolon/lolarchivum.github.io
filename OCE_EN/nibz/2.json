I did climb myself to bronze 4 and got to about 60lp and then went on a mass losing streak and now back in bronze 5\r\n\r\nAlot of the time I blame my team for the loss. But I blame silently but deep down I know its me\r\n\r\nI get frustrated with teams killing 4 people then instead of pushing and getting objectives they chase the last guy through jungle\r\nTeams that constantly go into unwarded jungle solo\r\nTeams not using tickets. . You&#039;re in the jungle jusy drop a ward!\r\nTeams deciding baron is a great idea when no wards on map 5 players alive and throw the game\r\nOne team we killed 5 of them out front of inhib tower and they all went dragon instead of getting inhib\r\n\r\nNow if you see my games it seems I feed.. I probably do but I also sacrifice myself to keep adc and others snowballing alive If needed. I setup stuns and think the 3 teammates behind me or in the bush with me  will go in but dont\r\nPlus im bronze I make stupid decisions and mistakes and most the time I know it&#039;s stupid but I still do it\r\n\r\nIm getting better at not making the same mistakes and learning from them\r\n\r\nSo that&#039;s me. I work rotating shifts so every day could be different to the next when im available.  But if any other bronzies keep to add and play together and hopefully climb im keen :) I feel game would be more fun with others working together\r\n\r\nI cant jung\r\nIm not the best adc or top\r\nI usually main and prefer support or mid","replies":[{"poster":"Fitzky","date":"2016-03-30T11:23:46.679+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Add me I'm a top and jungle main and play darius and rengar/kha'zix in these roles.
