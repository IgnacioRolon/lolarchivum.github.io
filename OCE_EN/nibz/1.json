It is easier to get a higher grade with off-meta picks, and uncommon or new champions. With someone like Lux I imagine a higher grade is achievable with some kills added on, not that you want to as a support, but she's bursty so it happens.\n\nMy top 3 supports have gotten A, A+ and S so far as passive supports (Janna, Lulu, Soraka) [This was my Soraka game](http://matchhistory.oce.leagueoflegends.com/en/#match-details/OC1/126826532/200862152?tab=overview), where admittedly I did have more kills than I usually would as her.\n\nUltimately... play better than everyone else?
