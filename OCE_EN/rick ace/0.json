You will receive Garen and Ashe for free at level 3 as part of hex tech promotion. You can also get tristana and alistar for free by following the instructions on [THIS](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/202083184-Promotional-Content-Free-Swag-) page.\n\nIf you open the application, there is a big orange button in the middle of it that says \"launch\". Launch the client, log in, then it will come to a different screen that has a big orange button in the same place that says \"play\". Click a game mode (tutorial/ intro bots) and then press play. \n\nCheck out the new players guide [HERE. ](http://oce.leagueoflegends.com/en/site/guide/index.html)","replies":[]},{"poster":"UseIess","date":"2016-05-05T08:04:37.481+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"i find the best way to start is buy taking your mums credit card calling up xiaoweixiao giving him your mums credit card details and purchasing a elo boost, this is generally a really great way to start the game, also spending your life savings on rp to buy skins for me is another great idea. good luck summoner and may the {{summoner:4}} be with u!!","replies":[]},{"poster":"Sexy Ching Chong","date":"2016-05-04T15:40:29.104+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"SPRAY AND WALK AWAY{{item:3027}} {{champion:21}}","replies":[]},{"poster":"Rick Ace","date":"2016-05-04T13:19:58.802+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"That was a real cool way to help me out thanks","replies":[]},{"poster":"Only Heimer","date":"2016-05-04T13:14:16.782+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"if you can't figure out where to click to open a game that you recently downloaded i would suggest not playing at all.","replies":[]}]}
