Nah i didnt wanna CC them Kalista just ult me instead to find out im not in range to hit them. Maybe its the weird windup the ult has that throws me off. Shes a great duo Q champ but I almost find myself wanting to dodge a game where shes my ADC.

Hell you could even troll and get thrown away from kalista and let her die","replies":[{"poster":"Project Xayah","date":"2014-12-04T07:07:15.800+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Basically this.

Ranged supports, even squishier ones, can still be a better option for binding since they can help proc her W passive and her ult puts them at max attack range from enemies that are hit (and can actually be used to help the sup escape, I do this a lot). But generally if you're not prepared to take on the responsibility you should ask the Kal to bind to the jungler rather than you as you suggested (they might not but it's worth a shot). As I mentioned though, she is very teamwork orientated and not an ideal champ for solo q.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Project Xayah","date":"2014-12-03T23:51:55.043+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"As somewhat of a Kalista main I understand your pain. Kal is a very teamwork orientated champ and when you're match with randoms there's not much teamwork to be had. At the moment it seems a lot of people are still getting used to how she works, which is probably why they've not been in range when they've ulted. Unfortunately there's not much you can do to avoid it short of dodging.","replies":[]},{"poster":"SkarSkarSkarner","date":"2014-12-03T15:32:34.875+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Kalista is a horrible champion.","replies":[{"poster":"TheTourist","date":"2014-12-03T16:01:46.046+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"> Kalista is a horrible champion.\n\nShe's far from a horrible champion.
