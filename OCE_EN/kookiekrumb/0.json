When i opened league client, it had to do a huge patch, which for me (on 100kbps download) took for ages, and was the final straw in my dc'ing activity, so I got 10 games 20 mins low priority :). It's based off how frequently it occurs, so it wouldnt have been a one off occurrence for you. You had it coming, was just a matter of time. I do however, think it's completely bullshit that the low priority queue timers dont go down after playing games. I went a whole year without any incident, and after a few medial issues, got 10 games 20 mins -_-. It's also great fun when you wait 20 mins for a queue, click accept, and then it cancels mid lobby saying \"something went wrong\"","replies":[]}]}
