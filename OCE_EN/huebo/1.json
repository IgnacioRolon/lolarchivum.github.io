Less popular and/or more expensive champions will be owned by less people and visa versa. So in a sense yes, some champions are weighted more heavily than others, simply by what people own.","replies":[{"poster":"Huebo","date":"2018-07-09T05:05:58.771+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"ok never mind this isn't true, the same champions continue to appear in every game.

The thing about randomness is that it's random. In the same way that some people will never see the same champion twice (statistically unlikely, but not impossible), the same is true for people who see the same champions a lot.","replies":[{"poster":"Huebo","date":"2018-07-12T05:21:52.912+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Ryze has never appeared in any of my games out of around 80, this is a champion that almost everyone owns.

It is rather strange it isn't explicitly stated anywhere, but they also don't have any FAQ or support pages dedicated to the limited gamemodes, so I imagine that's an oversight on their part.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Huebo","date":"2018-07-05T12:40:22.292+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"ah this makes sense","replies":[]}]}]}
