I had one of those really really really bad games that got me really pissed and frustrated at not being able to do anything and getting provoked for not being able to do anything","replies":[{"poster":"TimingOfLords","date":"2017-09-08T03:15:25.720+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"Telling someone to kill themselves or die by any means is a bannable offense. Whatever the reason for it, it is completely unacceptable and should result in at least a chat-restriction. If you are being flamed by anyone (your team or the enemy team) you should mute them. Everyone has bad games, but telling anyone to kill themselves can potentially be a trigger for any of the 9 other players in the game.\n\nNot to mention that fact that it is an automated system that checks the chat logs of the player that was reported in order to see if certain key words were said. It is an easily manipulated and very flawed system. You just happened to use one of the terms that results in a guaranteed ban/restriction.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Tomblade","date":"2017-09-13T02:33:02.789+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hi Virtual,\n\nIt's good to see that you recognise that you made a mistep during the game by falling to provocation.\n\nIn saying that, you must remember that you are judged on your own merits and not the actions of other players. You have had 3 chat restrictions prior to this suspension which should have told you that your behaviour was escalating and not improving.\n\nDo not be frustrated if you think other players are not being punished - while the report system does not always tell you someone has been banned, it could be the case that their behaviour is ON ITS WAY to resulting in a punishment. \n\nIf you see someone in game who is a total a**hole, chances are they are headed towards punishment. You may not be there to see it happen, but trust that if their behaviour doesn't improve, they will head there - just like you yourself are experiencing now.\n\nTake this suspension as time to reflect - don't fall for provocation by negative players. It does not help you have fun or win the game, so why interact with it?","replies":[]},{"poster":"Doc Savage","date":"2017-09-08T02:09:34.861+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"what riot need to do is limit chat related punishments to chat restrictions and mutes and stop suspending/banning people from playing the game for using \"bad words\" or \"being negative\".\n\nbut yeah theres already an option to not see /all chat so they might aswell give you the option to turn team chat off also.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Plutooh","date":"2017-09-08T00:40:22.939+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":3,"body":"What Riot need to do is allow people to turn chat off completely so we don't have to listen to whiney people complain all game. I don't give a shit that it's a team game and communication helps, if it means not having to listen to people bitch and complain then i'd turn chat off all together.","replies":[{"poster":"boobz","date":"2017-09-08T12:10:52.568+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"they could always mute the person, that's what the mute button is for or, just move the chat off the screen by moving it to the corner.","replies":[{"poster":"pieceofpecanpie","date":"2017-09-08T23:12:45.826+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"Why do people insist on pointing out the mute option like it's the be all and end all solution? From the language Plutooh used in his post you can tell he's more than aware of how chat currently works. He's talking about features chat _could_ have, not what it currently has. I know, we all know, that mute exists. But, let's face it, it's a workaround solution. \n\nRiot can definitely allow for much more customisation of how players experience league games when it comes to chat and communication and not jeopardise basic gameplay and strategy in any way. _\"Just mute them, ggez\"_??? Come on. We can all dream a little bigger from time to time.","replies":[]}]}]}]}
