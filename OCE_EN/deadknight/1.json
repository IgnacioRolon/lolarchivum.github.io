The normal crash report pop up didn&#039;t show up, it was just straight to my desktop. Normally I can run the game on around 240 fps and I&#039;ve only ever crashed once or twice. I was not running any processes in the background, nothing but league, and I also played a normal game directly before, which ran 100% fine. When I finally rejoined the game (it crashed once more, after it got to 100%) it was also fine, no more frame drops. I was wondering if anyone knew a reason as to why this would happen and any tips/advice on how to stop it from happening in the future, as I obviously don&#039;t want to continue losing games, much less because of freezes or crashes.","replies":[{"poster":"Mindstar","date":"2015-08-10T04:09:45.658+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hi DeadKnight,\n\nI'd suggest you try turning off \"Uncapped\" in your video framerate settings.  We generally set our competitive pcs on stage at live events to run at 144FPS to avoid issues like this.  There is a known issue where running uncapped can cause issues like you have seen.\n\nLet me know how you go!\n\nCheers\nMindstar","replies":[]}]}
