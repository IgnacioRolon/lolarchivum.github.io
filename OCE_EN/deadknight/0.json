I&#039;m fairly new to ranked and league in general and am in no way an expert (silver 3, approx 300 norm wins and approx 30 ranked games) but I&#039;d have to say about once every 5 games or so I am getting an AFK, either losing us the game, or at least really putting the game in a downward spin. Playing like this with the high likelihood of an AFK, troll or feeder has basically stopped me playing ranked. Is this just a low elo thing? Does it get any better in higher elos? I know a lot of people say this all the time but I really feel like something needs to be done about losing LP because of an AFK. There should be some sort of script or program in place that says &quot;hey X champ was afk for X time and now that team has lost, I don&#039;t think they should be penalised as much/at all&quot;. {{item:3070}}  tfw {{item:3070}}","replies":[{"poster":"McRuthless","date":"2015-08-29T20:38:52.651+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Theres just as many afks on the enemy team which cause you to win games (more in fact, if you never afk/cause people to afk), so you're not losing LP from them in the long run. \"But there was a chance we could win if he didn't afk\" you might say, surely they're causing me to lose LP? Well yes, but there was just as much chance you could lose in all those games if the enemy hadn't afk'd, no matter how far ahead you think you were or how much you put that victory down to your own good play. It balances out. And there is still plenty of trolls and afks and everything at higher ranks.\n\nPeople have to realise that all the afks, toxic players, feeders, bad teammates, and whatever they see as holding them back happens on the enemy team as well. You cant put one loss down to having a bad team, then put the next victory down to you playing well when the enemy team was just like your allies the previous game.","replies":[{"poster":"demonicslothman","date":"2015-08-30T03:43:34.418+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"its a shame that like 60% of games are decided by afk players though :(","replies":[{"poster":"JasonWazza","date":"2015-08-30T03:58:05.855+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"No they aren't, like half of the games where there are an AFK, the game is already decided.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"demonicslothman","date":"2015-08-29T14:58:24.645+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"the even tells you who went afk in the game in the post game screen with their name in red. i would be happy to have even a 50% reduction to LP loss with a team mates name in red and 75% for 2 afk and 100% for 3. or make a system that softens the blow to LP loss if you play well still with a handicap like that","replies":[{"poster":"Your Neighbour","date":"2015-08-29T16:04:30.528+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"2013 - new tribunal in development\n\n2015 - still testing after x new champions","replies":[{"poster":"Bipolar","date":"2015-08-29T16:59:28.771+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Your Neighbour,realm=OCE,application-id=Ntey9fRZ,discussion-id=yhcv80AU,comment-id=00000001,timestamp=2015-08-29T16:04:30.528+0000)\n>\n> 2013 - new tribunal in development\n> \n> 2015 - still testing after x new champions\n\nBecause the same people making the Tribunal are the same people whom are making champions\n\nayy lmao you're a joke.","replies":[{"poster":"Your Neighbour","date":"2015-08-30T12:09:59.775+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Accept the facts, even if they are not same group of people doesn't make those two statement less true.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"McRuthless","date":"2015-08-29T20:45:52.527+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"That would make people way more toxic. \"oh were losing this game badly, time to flame like crazy to try and make a teammate afk so I lose less LP\".

They say that you are doing bad when they are doing bad themselves and then intentionally feed a few times before going AFK for a bit, and then coming back into the game where we are already loosing only to feed all over again. I hope it is a low elo thing, the reason why I am in Bronze 5 is because of all this my provisionals turned to utter turd because people started to do this bull instead of working as a team which resulted in so many losses that it is not funny. I have been trying to dig my way out of it, but after every time I get a win with a good team that cooperates there is always that one, two or three people who can either... not play, have bad internet connection, are toxic as all hell, bring people down feed like crazy and go AFK when all I want to do is get out of the mess I am in right now... Anyways there is my rant, if you want to add me go ahead and we shall try and dig ourselves out of this godforsaken hell hole of a ranking.\n\nOn a side note. I just realised what you summoner name is!!! Have you always had it like that? That is awesome, should defs team up dude if you are up for it. Would love to see two Knights in combat :P","replies":[]}]}
