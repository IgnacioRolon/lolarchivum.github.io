I don't trust player theories, because they are always usually horribly wrong, like that one where they thought there was gonna be Yasuo's brother out with a Project skin. If we're gonna start weird theories, then I'm just gonna say that Jayce is related to Camille because her family stole crystals from the Brackern and Jayce is on Skarner's page for reasons unknown, so is he continuing his family's work or something?\n\nAlso, Camille was augmented at 25, can she even have kids with those robo legs? I haven't looked at her much, but if they are just robo legs that pop off, then I guess should have been fine, skimming through the latest lore page she has a hextech heart? and I see on her splashart she has robot eyes? She doesn't seem very human anymore. If you say she had a baby before 25, that's gonna make Vi way over 30 years old seeing as Camille is 80-90 right now.\n\nThat being said, she does seem like the type that would dump her kid at an orphanage because she doesn't have time for he/she.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}
