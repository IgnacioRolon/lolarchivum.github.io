I get that playing against higher tier players is a good way to learn, however when you are hardstuck in a low elo and go up against someone much higher than you and you get stomped every time you get to lane, then how are you supposed to learn anything if they just kill you as soon as you get there. There can be no learning done because how can you practice trying to trade with an enemy player at the right time or farming against them if you literally get stomped straight away. It takes away the ability for someone to learn gradually as they go from one rank to the next.","replies":[]}
