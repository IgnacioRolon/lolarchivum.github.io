This really F***ed me off so much and I feel bad for everyone else who has to sit through the same problem. I think you need to implement a remake option for people so they don't lose a series game or even LP in general from someone in their match having high ping that they cant even play  the match properly. I am happy there is the option of getting back there and having a free win however, we shouldn't have to even try to get back into promos if we can avoid it in the first place. Please consider this idea for a future update.","replies":[]}
