Shouldn&#039;t all new players learn the same things?\r\n2- Why does the tutorial make me buy thornmail on Ashe and proceed to tell me it&#039;s a good defensive item?","replies":[{"poster":"WandererYoshinon","date":"2018-06-26T11:59:16.188+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Different accounts having different tutorials feels like a good idea to me cause learning league all at once is painful where as doing a tutorial for say a bruiser after filling out a questionare to guess what role you would like would probably be beneficial for smoothing out the skill curve a bit. \n\nThe ashe thornmail thing should be imortalised in the form of answering yes to the question \"have you played league of legends before?\" on the hypothetical questionare cause it's funny as imo.","replies":[]}]}
