Top lane really doesnt have any say for Baron control so Baron is whatever.... but Dragon is so snowball-y that it can really change up the game. If you have a stronger bottom lane.... you can get the early dragon and get an advantage across all lanes. Think about every time your top and they get away with that sliver of health.\r\n\r\nMayb swtich the dragon buff orders???","replies":[{"poster":"Slim Chaedi","date":"2014-12-06T14:03:13.041+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"http://www.surrenderat20.net/p/current-pbe-balance-changes.html\n\n\"Dragon Slayer Buff\n\nThe Dragon Slayer buff has received a few changes\nDragon's Might has been reduced to 6% from 8%\n+15% damage to towers and buildings is now granted at  two stacks instead of four. \n +15% damage to minions and monsters is now granted at four stacks instead of two.\"\n\nI started checking SurrenderAt20 for PBE notes and it is nice to know what is quite possible :D","replies":[{"poster":"Obsidyth","date":"2014-12-06T15:37:17.040+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The dragon changes doesnt really fix the issue tbh....\n15% against minions for the first one makes more sense, then movement speed, then 15% tower damage, THAN 6% damage increase. \n\nORRRR just make all the buffs randomise...","replies":[{"poster":"Slim Chaedi","date":"2014-12-07T03:44:14.136+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I agree that it doesn't really fix the issue.

Or prob not depending on your point of view.\n\nThis encourages a flexible and healthy meta because different team comp will have a different focus, they will try to focus and take down either Baron or Dragon to enhance their particular team strength.\n\nJust foods for thought.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Your Neighbour","date":"2014-12-06T07:20:50.738+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Dragon is the new baron, don't ya know.\n\nBut yeah the stack power of dragon is just too amazing, I think maybe utility buffs like speed should come at first stack, not +6% damage","replies":[{"poster":"Obsidyth","date":"2014-12-06T07:41:09.809+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"That attack bonus really multiplies out too with more items and levels.... arrrgh","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Klavinmour","date":"2014-12-06T07:33:00.707+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Play Pantheon take dragon at level 1.\nThen proceed to run around the map like a %%%% throwing spears at Rav.","replies":[]}]}
