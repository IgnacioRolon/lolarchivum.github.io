Seriously!? \r\n\r\nThink about it, in nearly every conceivable way {{champion:429}} 's kit poops  all over {{champion:22}}  and not just a little bit, but from a birds eye view. \r\n{{champion:22}}  used to be the kitting queen,  and that was the entire reason why she was picked ( if ever ). Her kite potential balanced out the fact she didnt have a dash which made sense but now we have the same kite potential (if not better) on {{champion:429}}  with not just \"A\" dash but one every auto attack? \r\n\r\nTheir ults are arguably on par with each other in terms of general use and utility (being probably the two best adc ultimates in game) so I wont go there but if {{champion:22}}  was meant to be the best for kiting she just isn't anymore.","replies":[{"poster":"csm","date":"2014-12-02T06:29:02.137+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Because pre level 30 and bronze/silver players would probably make better use out of Ashe.","replies":[{"poster":"Obsidyth","date":"2014-12-02T07:25:23.732+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I agree as well.

Ashe for example has a 3s stun, if hit across the map, which also does AoE damage. Her vision grants her bonus gold and course her passive will absolute dominate early game poke with a guaranteed critical hit. As well as a volley on a low cooldown, and is AoE and slows. Ashe is still the kiting Queen and she always will be unless her kit is altered.","replies":[{"poster":"Obsidyth","date":"2014-12-02T07:24:16.515+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Ashe doesnt have a 3s stun. She has the potential for a 3 second stun... Theres a HUGE difference. The damage on her Ult is not all that impressive either. Its the utility and instant use of her ult to change a battle that makes it good.  Kalista's ult is arguably as useful in different ways... \n\nAshe's gold bonus is good and so is her passive but both are non-consequential in later game teamfights which is when an ADC is meant to shine.  Her W is her real saving grace but past that her normal AA range brings her into most brusier dash/gap closer's so she instantly needs to gain distance again.... blowing an ult or a flash or something. \nShe  needs a heavy front line wall for her to be useful. She needs to be built around and thats the problem","replies":[{"poster":"RichCont","date":"2014-12-02T07:59:32.747+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Her extra gold generation is useless in late game team fights?

She can slow pretty much whenever she wants. Even if she can't kite as good as Kalista, the fact that she  has an always readily available slow can be better. Plus, Ashe can help her teammates wherever she is. Ashe works better in some situations than Kalista. Anyway, a person who can kite well as Ashe but isn't accustomed to Kalista's passive would probably be best playing Ashe against a comp which they need to kite.\nI don't think you can just say one is better than the other, as they both have situations in which each are better.
