Rengar can be seriously abusive in the right hands but I dont understand how making his E a skill shot was a good idea especially when they nerfed so much of his kit already. \r\n\r\nI agree that he really wasn't in a good spot back in the day when he could stack BT's and roll the ADC's face with 1 combo.... But thats the thing, they nerfed EVERYTHING. His Q is pretty lacklaster now unless you Empower it and his stealth is kinda odd because of the exclamation mark thing that gives ganks away.\r\nNow for the sake of reason, I am willing to concede that these changes were warranted and that they are positive nature as they promote healthy Rengar builds and gameplay.... but this whole Bola Skill shot is downright retarded. \r\n\r\nOnce again, I get it! You want people to think about their skilll use and not just faceroll the keys but its insanely difficult to hit your bola at close range now which is probably the best time to use it if you catch someone in a bad position. \r\n\r\nI dont think im asking for much here but... maybe make Bola's cast on target when in melee range?! or maybe make his Empowered Bola cast on target since you are investing 5 stacks for it? \r\nI donno.... what do you guys think?","replies":[{"poster":"Obsidyth","date":"2014-12-04T13:30:26.041+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Am i seriously the only person that finds this an issue??","replies":[]},{"poster":"I am llluminati","date":"2014-12-03T19:43:21.782+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"well firstly I personally think his q is pretty good right now, not as good as pre-nerf/rework but still good. Secondly the exclamation mark on his ult was a good idea because imagine you're a squishy adc and then all of a sudden rengar just jumps at you with NO WARNING and 100-0's you in 1 second. The excalamation mark was a way to try and create some counterplay to his ult so his enemies would know when he's coming and have a few seconds to prepare. \n\nAbout his e though, yeah it's kinda sad imo since it's pretty much near useless in lane unless your enemy stands outside minions cos he's %%%%%%ed or when your jungler comes and you're chasing them through the lane. But still the upside of it being a skillshot is that it has more range and can hit people out of vision/check bushes which means mid-late game (not in lane phase) it's pretty useful.

They are both well warranted since his spike damage was over the top and his lane ganks were too strong....\n\nHe simply did tooo much damage too quickly and was masked too well with his ultimate.... but both of these aspects have already taken a nerf, so why hit the bola with a nerf as well? \n\nRight now if you Ultimate into the fight, the target knows he is going to be attacked with the exclamation mark WHICH IS FINE, but his bola is such a low % skill shot now that they almost ALWAYS manage to get away. \n\nAll im saying is, you have already hit his spike damage.... and his stealth ( more or less)...  you could do the bare minimum and make his Bola cast on target when in melee range and a normal skillshot at range. \n\nI don't believe this is a huge ask.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Essembie","date":"2014-12-03T20:52:36.880+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Tone abet allowed volunteers to  reduce bola","replies":[]}]}
