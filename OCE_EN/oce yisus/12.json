Make it the first champ hit stun, not AOE, I shouldn&#039;t be able to stun a group of targets that easily\r\n2. Attack speed bonus should go down to 70% at rank 5, and 2.5-5 seconds duration that scale as you level it\r\n3. Remove the damage part, and add a bit more to the single target stun, it&#039;s a grapple and shouldn&#039;t be doing damage","replies":[{"poster":"Talon12","date":"2016-12-17T14:04:22.767+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Get over it they putting a hotfix in as an aoe .25-.5 sec knockup instead of stun, unless the decide to go back on that anyway","replies":[]},{"poster":"Fitzky","date":"2016-12-17T11:01:22.539+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Who the hell are you talking about?
