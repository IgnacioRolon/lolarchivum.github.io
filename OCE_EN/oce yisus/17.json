Your giving up heal, you are now a combat summoner short on the enemy bot lane.\n2. You can't realistically buy the item first on her, she struggles in lane (unless you outclass the enemy by a mile and then, simply buy BotRK and stomp sooner) taking away her sustain item is just going to hold her right back, and actually give the opposing laner a chance.\n3. This means devourer is at 5k Gold to be able to start stacking, this is a huge problem, as buying it first generally leads a jungler to have devourer around the 17 minute mark, meaning you are looking at 30+ minutes to get this item done.\n4. If your far enough ahead for this to be viable, it's twice as viable to just snowball and end the game and not risk a throw, your still only a vayne, 1 fuckup could be a throw, delaying your core power spike isn't helping anything.","replies":[{"poster":"Chicken4dinner","date":"2015-07-12T05:09:05.384+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I agree with wazza, her early game is the worst I know for an adc atm and buying trashy laning items like machete (plus losing heal for smite, lels are real) means you could die without a hope of fighting back (considering that her q scales off ad, which you don't get from devourer).
