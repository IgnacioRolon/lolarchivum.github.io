You are clueless. A mans last resort when he is out of arguments, tell the other person their dumb or arrogant with no proof. The only reason my words don't make sense to you is because you don't have any sense yourself. Claiming pantheons e passive crits one shot an adc, when that's the complete opposite of how it works, and if your complaining about the active one shotting then I have no idea why your talking about crits and thinks it one shots. Reworking the q pretty much changes panth into a different champion that already exists but ten times better {{champion:76}}","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Faelaren","date":"2014-12-09T13:19:48.814+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Sorry friend but by doing something like that I think you would pretty much be reworking Panth to something that he isn't.
