It's not Riot's fault people were expecting URF to happen, that's just an assumption people have been making (and fairly unfounded too). So what it happened the last two years? Doesn't make Riot obliged to do it again this year.\n\nAnd let's face it, it's a pretty good April Fools. I mean, lead everyone to think that it's going to happen, tell them it's not but, *plot twist*, you were telling the truth that it's not happening. Not to mention, now we get to see if all those idiots that said they'd leave if URF didn't come out actually leave or if they were just talking big.","replies":[]},{"poster":"OCE Yisus","date":"2016-04-03T07:41:24.180+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I would happily wait for rotational queue, if this and the next weekend weren't the last weekends I'll be free on until the end of the year","replies":[]}]}
