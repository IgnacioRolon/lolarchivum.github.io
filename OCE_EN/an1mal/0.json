The good news is that Telstra tell us that they have identified the root cause of this issue in NSW.  The bad news is that they won't be able to make any change to their network to fix the problem until some time next week.\n\nPossible Workaround:  We believe that based on the description of the issue from Telstra, that it may be possible to bypass this issue by using a local VPN Service to connect to League.   Until they implement a fix within their network, this will be your best shot for playing League smoothly.\n\nIf anyone has access to a VPN and is willing to give it a try, I'm sure other Telstra players would love to hear from you!\n\nMindstar","replies":[{"poster":"AV11","date":"2018-06-01T09:19:58.069+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Just played a game with a VPN and didn't have any disconnections, let's hope they don't come back :)","replies":[{"poster":"420CnollGG","date":"2018-06-01T09:35:36.170+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Which VPN service did you use?
