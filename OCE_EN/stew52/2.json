What I would like is for Riot Games to push a major lore event similar to the Noxian/Ionian war, I have a few idea&#039;s on what that could be but I don&#039;t see a point to listing them. \r\n\r\nNow we see in games such as World of Warcraft where they do major lore advancement every few years which has helped (Maybe not a lot but I believe it has helped a lot) keep the game interesting for those that play it and is the sole reason some people still play it (such as myself), now you could say they do these major lore updates because they must due to how MMO&#039;s work which is true but I am just saying that the same idea could be applied to League of Legends.\r\n\r\nI wouldn&#039;t have made a post about this if I haven&#039;t watched the game for a every long time have very little progression in it&#039;s lore and with people saying that league is slowly dying I just wanted to express my idea on how it could prolong its life. Currently the lore of League of Legends only grows around it&#039;s champions which is fine but when they come out all they do is flesh out the pre-established lore (Swain and/or Irealia as example) or just add more lore to an area that has very little impact on the whole picture (Such as Pyke), Aatrox could be a big lore event if the Darkin are huge in the lore but I don&#039;t expect riot to make them actually do anything with them other than they **did** something in the past.\r\n\r\nRiot has made some medium lore events such as Blidgewater being flung into chaos at the &#039;death&#039; of Gankplank or when the harrowing happened (They still happen right? I haven&#039;t heard anything about them for two years or so). I understand that there are major lore events with new skins happening in alternate universes but the problem is that these don&#039;t affect the actual games lore.\r\n\r\nI am not saying that a major lore event would save league by itself, there are a few things that need to be addressed but this could **help**.","replies":[{"poster":"punpun irl","date":"2018-06-23T06:36:22.368+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"Lore is like story in porn, it's there but not many people pay attention or even care about it. {{champion:91}} Lore is not really needed but It'll please some players who care about the lore side of the game so thats nice {{sticker:slayer-pantheon-thumbs}}\n\nP.S-\nI'm Stew52's biggest fangirl ‚ù§Ô∏èüí™","replies":[]},{"poster":"DarkShade918","date":"2018-06-23T10:40:27.526+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Just more missions more often, would fix the games state (since they're not gonna balance it any time soon)","replies":[]},{"poster":"TheDemonEmperor","date":"2018-06-23T01:55:00.765+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"This game isnt a story driven type of game.
