Now to explain my reasoning behind my opinion; I play champs like Swain, Mordekaiser, Miss Fortune, Kog'maw and so on. Now the champs listed are the ones I like personally so my opinions might be bias but hear me out. With league of legends the new champs have become more and more mobility based with champs like yasuo, azir and kalistar as proof, older champs like the ones I listed don't have the dashes that these champs do and in the case of swain his kit is almost countered by one dash (Land w then use q+e with your ult on and attack). Now you would say \"But it how is it unfair?\" now you see if swain can land he w he is able to kill or severe damage a target but with the all the dashes that most champs have his ability to land it becomes incredibly hard, as soon as they see the circle they just jump away and even if you do manage to catch one the champ can out trade you (Depends how they are going) then jump away as most mobility champs have just as much damage or more damage. Swains main weaknesses are that he has very bad mana issues and he damage is mostly DoT which isn't as effective as a burst but now with all of this mobility his kit which was balanced a year or two ago now leaves him weaker than most. Tired of hearing about swain? okay lets look at brand, He needs to land a spell to do his burst (as does do most champs) the first spell usually used is his w then followed with other spells, the counterplay is that you can dodge it because of its delay but if the champ has a dash then they can actually engage on brand when he uses his w and win trades almost all of the time. Now you are saying \"If you have an issue with their lack of mobility just play someone else!\" Although this is an option I would rather not, I like swain and champs that have similar play styles to his but over the past year it's become harder to play them because of all the dashes that are now in the game. The someone would say \"So just play a different lane\" The same thing is happening in the other lanes although most champs in these lanes originally were more mobile but there is still a large mobility creep happening there like in bot lane we have lucian and kalista for example, in top there is Gnar who can kite almost anything, Jungle has always been where the highest mobility champions were found so mobility creep isn't that bad there. Another issue is that most champs with dashes or high mobility have damage equal or greater than someone who doesn't have as much mobility, so most fights its either the champ with low mobility waits for the one that does to use it before they engage (which can take for ages unless they force it) which can let the jungler get in position to gank or let wards die and so on, or That they attack and have most of their abilities dodged at the start or they dodge the killing blow at the end kill the low mobility champ but now you say \"Thats how you out play someone!\" thats not the case, how is fizz using his E to dodge syndra ult an outplay? or lucian dashing the the side of morganas q an out play? Its the champ that does it not the skill of the player. So you can either flame me over my opion of the high mobility of you can try to understand what I am getting at.\r\n\r\nTD;LR the high mobility + high damage is too strong compared to the traditional high damage + low survivability because mobility gives a massive amount of survivability.\r\n\r\nStew52","replies":[{"poster":"KingDinger","date":"2015-02-25T22:56:38.279+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"wall of text, not worth the read.","replies":[{"poster":"KingDinger","date":"2015-02-25T22:57:52.211+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"but the brand comment....his W is his damage....you dont LAND W first...you use it while they are stunned.

But I don't think that the mobility is the problem, it is just the fact that Swain, Brand, Mordekaiser etc are at the bottom of the meta. Keeping a game balanced is hard and currently Rito isn't looking at the bottom of the pack. If Swain got a damage buff or half a second taking off his w delay then he would be fine. Similar situations for Brand and Morde.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Pretz","date":"2015-02-26T04:43:49.864+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"paragraphs plz","replies":[]}]}
