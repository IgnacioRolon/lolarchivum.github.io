She also needs a new skin and the Academy Team needs a Marksman to join them)\r\n\r\nWARRING KINGDOM JHIN (Jhin is a strong candidate for this skin due to his mask and general outfit...he needs also a new skin and Warring Kingdom team also is in need of a Marksman)\r\n\r\nDRAGONSLAYER MALZHAR (Due to the arrival of Malz update and his lack of new skins i think his can fit in to this team with a proper outfit)\r\n\r\nGUARDIAN OF THE SANDS CORKI (Corki needs a new skin ASAP! And the perferct for this one is a Corki riding a giant beetle so the Guardian of the Sands get their Marksman)\r\n\r\n&#039;&#039;FELLOWSHIP&#039;&#039; (aka The LotR inspired team including Ryze,Gragas,Braum,Varus) EKKO (Ekko could fit the Fellowship Team as the &#039;&#039;Hobit&#039;&#039; of the team.I think he is made for this team not only thematically but for the line up of the rest of the team)\r\n\r\n&#039;&#039;HARBOR&#039;&#039; (aka the recent 4 member team of Garen,AAtrox,Quinn,Malphite) NIDALEE (Imagine a beggar Nidallee with a fishing pole instead of spear and a fishing net instead of traps.She transforms in a wild black alley cat)\r\n\r\nSo we have already a complete Battlecast , Pentakill , PROJECT, Bloodmoon , Commando  , Pool Party 1 , Pool Party 2 , Headhunter , Football , Snow Day , Deck of Cards , FNATIC , Taipei Assassins , Samsung White , SKT1\r\nand TONS of 3 member teams like Infernal (welcome Diana) , Prehistoric , Hextexh , High Noon...\r\n\r\nI would love to see a new fun game mode where Skin Teams collide!!! They can share special Team Passives or maybe a shared TEAM ULTI!!!! \r\n\r\nIf you likes my idea pls share this on the world and maybe Riot can do this gift for us :) pls leave your comments and extra ideas :)","replies":[{"poster":"P0Ps","date":"2016-04-23T00:12:53.577+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"If you really want this to be noticed it would probably be a good idea to post this on other server forums as well, the OCE forum's aren't checked very often so if you want this to be a thing then go on NA and EU server forums.\nIf you find someone artistic and draw up an example of some of the skins, then it would also be a good idea to put them in the player creations section so that people can view what each skin could look like, it also allows for the community to give feedback on individual skins.\nI do like the idea of this game mode though, although it could be hard to implement, (what if you don't own the champion or skins etc.)","replies":[{"poster":"O O I O O","date":"2016-04-30T00:46:13.541+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"hello there friend and thank you for your honest and kind reply and advices...i will surely post this idea on other servers too! now about the implementation...hextech crafting its a solution because it allows skin rent....or maybe some IP spend to join the game mode with the skin you want to play with for the current match...i think Skin Wars has to much room and space for ideas and development :)","replies":[]}]}]}
