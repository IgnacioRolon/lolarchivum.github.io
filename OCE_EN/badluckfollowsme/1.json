I&#039;m just not touching League for a couple of months.\r\n\r\nI love this game. I love that feeling when you pull your team out of a lethal situation, I love drawing people into that trap that makes them take a step back from their monitor for a moment and question their life choices, I love the different mechanics that each champion brings. But today I had just a fleeting moment, when I actually felt clinically depressed, and I feel like that&#039;s an indication that I need to take a step back. And it&#039;s nothing to do with the game, it&#039;s the people.\r\n\r\nIt&#039;s not just the toxicity, it&#039;s not just the supreme lack of intelligence in the lower elos that makes me question how people can breathe unaided, it&#039;s the fact that it&#039;s all thrown at you at the same time, so hard that it feels like you&#039;re literally drowning in it.\r\nAnd I know the arguments, &quot;Well the enemy has an equal chance to get these people that you do,&quot; but I&#039;m one of those rare people that have never encountered this. In my last year of play, I can count the number of games on my fingers that I have seen an enemy team get someone who isn&#039;t just having a bad game, isn&#039;t just fighting someone better than them, but are legitimately toxic/bad to the point of suicidal thoughts. And the frequency I&#039;ve seen these people has just increased and increased, and I have no idea what&#039;s causing it.\r\n\r\nI&#039;m not amazing. I don&#039;t do those insec plays, I don&#039;t consistently become so fed I can happily 1v5 in the enemy fountain. My mechanics are average at best, sometimes better sometimes worse. I&#039;m exactly in the place that I should be. But for the life of me, I do not understand how people learn to be better when they&#039;re essentially trying to learn how to swim with 2-4 people holding your head under the water. I don&#039;t know what to do when I ping every missing, but everyone ignores it every single time to the point my lane is 10/0 with none of them being me. I don&#039;t know  what to do when top lane is more interested in having sex with my mother than actually farming. I don&#039;t know what to do when it&#039;s been 30 minutes and the jungle has yet to look in my general direction. I don&#039;t know what to do when my adc decides to 1v5 the enemy under the tower. I don&#039;t know what to do when our only tank leaves the team to die when they&#039;re at full health and cooldowns.\r\n\r\nThe toxicity, the sheer stupidity, the constant spam of all chat because that will totally help your team, I just can&#039;t anymore. I can&#039;t deal with a team game where it&#039;s 3v7 at best every single game. And so I&#039;m taking a break.\r\n\r\nAnd these comments will probably be spammed with &quot;Git gud m8&quot; and &quot;It&#039;s better at higher elos&quot; because that absolutely affects the present situation mmhmm, and 100% there will be the lolnexus guys with &quot;Well I can totally see why this is happening to you&quot; because those statistics absolutely say everything about what happened in a game (looking at you fed people that do nothing unless you can get a kill from it without risking your kda then scream gg noob team). But this is mainly for my peace of mind, so I can get out everything that&#039;s been bothering me time and time again before it drives me insane, so I don&#039;t care. And I know that I&#039;m not the only one noticing these things, or at least I hope I&#039;m not, so maybe others can read this and know that it&#039;s not just you this happens to.\r\n\r\nAnyway, rant over. To all the people that still have fun and try to be better with every choice you make, good luck and stay positive. Hope to see you go places.\r\nAnd to the others, the people that rage, the people that afk because they don&#039;t get what they want, the people that are consistently stupid but refuse to acknowledge it. Well, all I can say is I hope one day you go back to playing single player games, because you sure as hell aren&#039;t working as a team.","replies":[{"poster":"Tele","date":"2016-02-21T04:53:23.634+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"We're sorry to see you go, you seem like a decent guy who's just hit some dark times. I'd just like to give you a new perspective on things if possible though.\n\n+ You'll often here people like **Riot Lyte** talk about [negativity bias](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Negativity_bias). Essentially, negative experiences impact you more than positive ones.\n\n If you look down your match history, how many of the games you had were actually negative? Not as in KDAs or results, but more toxicity and behavior.\n\n Was that **Vel'Koz** game today toxic? I seemed like a great game to me, you got a triplekill :D\n How about that** Vi **game 2 days ago? Or the **Hecarim** one?\n\n If you do this you'll notice that the majority of your games aren't toxic. That might not be the case recently, but on a large scale it probably is.\n\n+ Another thing that might help, is focusing on how to fix the issue;\n\n Keeping the game in focus and staying away from stuff like _\"jungler didn't gank\"_, **will** win you more games and keep an aura of positivity within the team.\n\n **_ Keep the game strategically focused, and reward good play!_**\n\n _\"it's ok, focus on farming I think, we need you late game\"\n\"we can come back from this easy\"\n\"bot is doing great though, lets focus on snowballing of them\"\n\"careful guys, we can win this, but we have to be smart and not throw\"_\n\n Throw some _\"gj\"_ and _\"nice\"_ every time someone does something decent and you'll find games (even losses) will be more positive :D\n\nIf you want a more light-hearted take on this, maybe watch one of [Sky's videos](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cz7TWpRXyRY) on this _(Careful, he does use some language you might consider offensive)_.\n\n+ Sometimes, you'll encounter a toxic game anyway. When it happens, don't let it tilt you! \n\n Take a break, play some ARAM, play some normals, maybe even play another game you enjoy. Spamming games for a win is the worst thing you can do when in a negative mind set. \n\n You'll start to play and act off emotions and your strategic thinking and level-headed actions will take a back seat. \n\nUsually I know when I'm like this, when I feel the greatest need to queue up, like I need to redeem myself for the last game.\n\nI hope this helps a little. \nRemember most importantly, that this is just a game. Don't take it too seriously ;)","replies":[{"poster":"BadLuckFollowsMe","date":"2016-02-21T05:37:50.072+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yeah, these are all valid points. From memory the Vel game was pretty toxic and more than slightly disheartening, having been dragged on far longer than it should have because the Xin that kept complaining he was only feeding because of lag that somehow made him repeatedly dive into the enemy team refused to surrender. The triple was certainly the highlight there :P\nAnd the Vi game, hoo boy, the enemy decided to go with the \"Let's put one person on tilt to get the advantage\" strategy and that person was me, so yeah not a happy memory, but apart from that it wasn't too bad.\n\nBut yeah, I think I just need to take a break and get my head on straight before I turn into the stereotypical Riven main and go full toxic on everyone, maybe come back with everyone on mute for a bit to see how it goes. I'm certainly not gone for good.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Fitzky","date":"2016-02-21T03:49:12.554+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"5k on League of Legends?!
