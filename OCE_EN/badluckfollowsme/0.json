You go into your provisionals, your performance in those determines where you should be based on your skill. Makes sense. Then you rise or fall during the season, gaining skill as you go.\r\nMy problem is that that same logic isn&#039;t being applied to subsequent seasons. You&#039;re not being placed based on your skill in your provisionals, you&#039;re being placed based on your skill in the previous season, which may not apply anymore. It&#039;s basically saying &quot;I don&#039;t care if you&#039;re now playing at diamond standard, you&#039;re still going to silver.&quot;\r\n\r\nNow if I had to guess this is so people don&#039;t need to grind back to plat or challenger, but to be honest, that doesn&#039;t seem logical to me. Getting to that kind of skill takes effort, why should it no longer require effort to stay there? Why should you get a free pass to stay there rather than have to work it up again? In saying that, maybe the outcomes of provisionals matter more in determining your new placing when you start getting higher, I don&#039;t know, so forgive me if I made a mistake there.\r\n\r\nSo what are your thoughts, what do you consider the pros and cons of soft and hard resets?","replies":[{"poster":"shalexade","date":"2015-05-01T07:19:45.429+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Why is a soft reset better than a hard one?\n\nBecause a seasons worth of games is a more indicative measure of ones skill than 10 games.\n\nWhen you say \"My problem is that that same logic isn't being applied to subsequent seasons.

It's basically saying \"I don't care if you're now playing at diamond standard, you're still going to silver.\"\"\n\nThat isn't what happens in a soft reset.  In a hard reset, that's exactly what happens. All the bronze players, the silvers, the golds, the diamonds, the masters and the challengers all get dumped back into silver V and have to deal.\n\nSoft resets don't do that, they use your MMR. I'll use myself as an example.\n\nLast year, I had a high MMR (for my ranking), but only scrapped into Gold 5, literally 10 minutes to midnight on the final cut off.\n\nAfter playing my promo's this season, I opened my account in Gold 4.\n\nWhy did this happen? Cause of the high MMR- which was determined throughout the season.","replies":[{"poster":"BadLuckFollowsMe","date":"2015-05-04T12:20:49.041+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Like I said, don't know what happens in the higher elos, so thank you for informing. I merely based my observation on the experiences of the people I've talked to. It seems that silver 1 and below, how well you do in the new season provisionals makes zero difference to your new season placing, but from the sounds of it that starts to change the further you go up. So from what I can tell, it's not so much a problem with the soft reset, it's the mmr curve at the lower tiers that needs some work to make the new season provisionals feel like they will actually make a difference if you win or lose, rather than the \"I need to do these so I can grind again\" formality they currently are.","replies":[{"poster":"shalexade","date":"2015-05-06T05:47:26.567+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I guess that's the point, they do make a difference, but not the kind of difference you're hoping for.\n\nI don't mean to sound rude, but bronze 5 accounts for the bottom 10% of players- you don't get a free ride back up to 50% at the end of the season. You gotta play (or grind as you put it) your way back up there :)","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Ediwir","date":"2015-05-06T07:44:54.571+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Why soft resetting instead of hard resetting?

The pros have to spend time owning up for days before they eventually get back to their proper rank.
