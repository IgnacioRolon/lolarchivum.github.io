At the end of the game it said i was low prioritized and i have to wait 20 minutes before each game for 5 games. The interesting thing is though i was playing with my brother next to me the whole entire game, he was blitz support. the same thing happened to him yet he wasn&#039;t low prioritized. Why am i low prioritized why my brother isn&#039;t?","replies":[{"poster":"HORSE OF FORCE","date":"2015-06-07T05:39:25.445+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Penalties are applied to accounts based on how many 'markers' you've accumulated recently. If you had been detected for leaving more games in the recent past than your brother has and you both left a game together, then you would be more likely to get a penalty than he.
