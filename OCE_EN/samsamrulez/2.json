Most games my ping would stay on 600. I have tried cleaning up my computer uninstalling games i no longer use yet i still have high ping issues. Is there some sort of program i can use to lower my ping and not get my account stolen?","replies":[{"poster":"Mindstar","date":"2015-07-01T04:28:08.792+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey,\n\nYour ping is related to the quality of your internet connection and the path between your computer and the League of Legends servers.  600 sounds super high and must really be a pain to try and play with!\n\nA few questions:\n - What location/city are you playing from?\n - What ISP do you use?\n - Do you use Wifi or a cable to connect your computer to your modem/router?\n\nBTW - There's a pretty good article about [troubleshooting connection issues](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues) on our support site, with quite a few good suggestions of things you can try.\n\nLet me know how you go!\nCheers\nMindstar","replies":[]}]}
