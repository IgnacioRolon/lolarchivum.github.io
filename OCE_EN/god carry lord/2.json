Now after i do that someone in my team will dodge for sure (i have tried this) now i will get no punishment while that guy will get a dodge penalty.  This doesn&#039;t happen constantly but its quite constant in ranked not for people trolling, they do it when they want to dodge or dont play themselves so they use this strategy to get someone to dodge. i have done this several times as well and pissed many people off since my friend just came on and i wanted to duo with him. Therefore i reckon there needs to be an option to report people in champ select. what you reckon? better answer or i will be doing this all day xd,","replies":[]}
