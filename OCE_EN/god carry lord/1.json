However with this new dynamic people i haven&#039;t seen a single champ select troll yet unlike solo Que which every fourth champ select you would get teemo jg lock in; so because of this players are careless with their dodges and use them on every possible scenario. (e.g they feel like their team comp is a bit weaker or they didn&#039;t get the exact champ or role they wanted). i was wondering to know whats your opinion on this cause i just had 4 champ select dodges in row and I&#039;m still in que","replies":[{"poster":"Nijel","date":"2016-04-07T04:53:57.687+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I see a distinct trade off between having low and high penalties for first time dodges.\n\n* When the penalty is low players will dodge because of little things. The thing you lose is time.\n* When the penalty is high people feel trapped in games they don't want to play. Depending on how hard they take it (or if they troll) you may lose the game and your time.\n\nPersonally, I'd rather just wait then have to play with someone who doesn't want to play at all.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Slowdownn","date":"2016-04-07T04:09:49.488+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Have a bit of patience as dodging is part of the strategy to maintain winnings. Guys who play every game ends up losing more then winning as the odds in dynamic queue is in favours of that.
