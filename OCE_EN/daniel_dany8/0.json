I stopped playing League around June 2015 and my account got compromised without my knowledge during November 2015 - January 2016 as match history shows.\r\n\r\nMy question here is, is there any hope at all to retrieve my account?? as quiet a lot of time has been spent on it and its really unlucky i guess for this to happen. :(\r\n\r\nI have already submitted a few support tickets but is it still worth trying or is all hope lost for me?","replies":[{"poster":"SephirothSG","date":"2016-06-21T03:17:27.773+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey there,\n\nI'm unable to comment on whether or not you have a chance at being unbanned as I'm not sure myself.\n\nYour best bet (Which it sounds like you've already done) is to submit a support ticket and have Player Support look into the case for you.","replies":[{"poster":"Daniel Dany8","date":"2016-06-21T03:31:22.143+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thanks for replying.  Judging by what the support members have been telling me, I  dont think they believe what i am saying and refuse to see the issue from my perspective. I dont know what to do anymore, but i know that its definitely worth the time it will take to try and get my account back, if there is a chance at least.","replies":[{"poster":"SephirothSG","date":"2016-06-21T03:32:38.951+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Can you reply with your ticket number?

Explain your situation but keep it short (the rest of the info should be in the other tickets) and that should get you on the right track to finding a resolution.\n\nGood luck :)","replies":[{"poster":"Daniel Dany8","date":"2016-06-23T03:19:30.941+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Ok thank you very much i will try this. :)","replies":[{"poster":"Wuks","date":"2016-07-20T10:03:00.460+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey Daniel, I just wanted to follow up with you to see if the issue has been resolved!
