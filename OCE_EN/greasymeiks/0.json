My team managed to win, but the losing team didn&#039;t get a loss prevented, which stupid, as it clearly wasn&#039;t any problem with personnel internet connection. I then queued for another game, but upon hitting lobby, the client went black and I got a loading message. Just to be safe, I&#039;ve stopped playing for the night.\r\n\r\nHas anyone else encountered these problems tonight?","replies":[{"poster":"luphisto","date":"2015-10-21T03:15:50.411+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"yea been getting a lot of lag/connection issues in game lobbies and random packet loss in games.\nusing a stable computer on a stable highspeed fiber connection. \n\nnot being able to see whos called or picked what for a minute when i join lobby is absolutely terrible.","replies":[{"poster":"BL Funk","date":"2015-10-29T11:56:53.527+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I've got the exact same issue man, great laptop, great internet, but massive packet loss and disconnecting constantly. \nWhat's up? {{item:3070}}","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"GentlemanReptile","date":"2015-10-20T17:05:24.403+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"If we get stuck with any demotions I'm going to be so pissed.","replies":[]},{"poster":"AP Ez Sup","date":"2015-10-20T16:59:32.990+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"yeah i got this problem too, sucks","replies":[]},{"poster":"TrevorBrown","date":"2015-10-20T16:54:07.104+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"OMG im in my promo, and we were winning, ad,ap and me (sup) keep ds,we are now losing!!!!!!!!wtf riot plz!!!!@riotgame","replies":[{"poster":"xoxHoneyBadgerxx","date":"2015-10-21T11:15:14.441+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Do you just go round all the forum posts complaining about how you lost your ranked game cause dc or something","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"GreenFrog","date":"2015-10-20T16:49:16.607+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Happening server wide.
