So when I get into games all the characters, minions, and jungle camps are invisible. Also sometime in game the game interface will not work like my abilities, where champions are on map, other champions abilities, torrent shots and minion waves freezing, death timers stuck on zero will happen all at once! \n\nThese problems currently require me to reconnect to the game or restart client and often leads to getting 20minute waits. I have even set my league on the lowest setting to see if it will work but problems still occur, this has been an ongoing occurance and problem effecting my ability to play the game for several patches and my fps and ping has been fine. I honestly  don't like getting penalised for something I don't know how to control and fix. Please help me.","replies":[{"poster":"Talon12","date":"2017-03-13T09:12:13.022+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"its a bug on laptop where assets aren't loaded, you either need to change t high performance or keep reloading until they show.","replies":[]}]}
