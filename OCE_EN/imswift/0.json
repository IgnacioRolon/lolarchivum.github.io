Now I don&#039;t usually afk a lot but when I do its for a valid reason, but I&#039;m not saying that I shouldn&#039;t get punished for it because I my self hate it when a team member afks, all I&#039;m asking for is maybe to reduce the time on the buster or at least reduce the number of low priority que, I honestly had enough of waiting 1 hour 40 minutes (added all together) doing nothing. Thank you .","replies":[]}
