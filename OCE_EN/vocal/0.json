I did not type anything directly at my team. \r\n\r\nBut just because they're 3 or 4 friends they decide to 4 stack + obviously tell the enemy team to report for Harassment and Negative attitude. When the chat log was full of them abusing me!\r\n\r\nNext game what do you know? I get notified for not behaving according to League standards!!! Okay. What the hell. I did nothing wrong but now I'm accused of this??? \r\n\r\nThe report system is terribly flawed in that players can bias an entire team to participate in reporting an innocent player. Which, that innocent player could be suspended for!!?!?! \r\n\r\nLeague has a completely unreasonable justice system that preys on the wrong people and lets the truly bad people get away with it.","replies":[{"poster":"godsmustbecrazy3","date":"2015-02-03T10:29:01.141+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"A bunch of %%%%%%s decide to 4 man queue, a very good and green ribbon player is put on that %%%%%%ed team.
