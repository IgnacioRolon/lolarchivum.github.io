If i transferred back now would my contribution to the Ocean Week Reef statue be removed? Do you already have a compiled list of all the summoners that contributed? I don't mind waiting, I'm actually having more pleasant encounters with blind pick summoners here than I did before. {{champion:36}} \r\n\r\nThanks for hosting such a great event! {{champion:111}}","replies":[{"poster":"Zaps","date":"2015-02-10T23:55:43.571+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Transferring back should have no impact on having your name on the Ocean Week reef! \n\nThat said, we're more than happy to have you if you're enjoying yoursself! :D","replies":[]},{"poster":"HORSE OF FORCE","date":"2015-02-10T05:16:35.643+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"OH\n\nTHAT'S WHY EVERYONE WAS TRANSFERRING TO OCE AND BACK TO NA\n\nTHAT EXPLAINS A LOT\n\nAnyway, the OCE Help & Support boards are a stigma to the reds. Try posting this on the [Miscellaneous](http://boards.oce.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/miscellaneous) boards to get their attention instead. Also, it wouldn't hurt to also make one on the NA boards.","replies":[{"poster":"BabaYegaa","date":"2015-02-10T06:40:58.770+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thanks!
