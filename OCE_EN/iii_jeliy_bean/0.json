First game I played I believe it was a ranked or it was a normal draft, anyway, before game started This summoner &#039;[removed]&#039; was being a troll and actually pretty rude even before banning champions. He fed pantheon, not intentionally, but he was talking crap even before game started and during game. and i said these things:\n- lol teeto\n- i iolke that btr than teemo\n- i suck at farming\n- i need to farm im so behind\n-: malph mid\n- really\n- why\n-why\n-why\n- why\n- why\n- BE THER\n- im not roaming anymore.\n- kinda tilted that she lived lol\n-im done.\n-well you guys legit go in to fight\n- stop going in\n- i mean you guys keep gonig in like that were defs not gunna win\n- why do you guys go into them\nI- yeah but you guys go in one by one\n-: like janna for example\n-: liek what\n-: im fucking over this shit\n-: this is why i dont fight. but i dont have a choice\n-: lol i didnt\n- i did not feed mid\n- i got fed off her\n-: she got fed by roaming so dont even talk\nI- lol\n-: you fed panth\n- i dont care anymore\n-: no actually its called pushing\n-: lol really?\n-: 1/4/1\n-n: and im inting\n-: what could i ahve done there fucking flash with no flash?\n-: lol okay report me for doing nothing but carrying yourt ass\n\nJust because i swore at a team mate once, i got reported and banned from it. Yet im sure he didn&#039;t. Doesn&#039;t make any sense.\n\nSecond game I got reported for the exact same thing and i even had friends playing with me, the Yi on my team didn&#039;t gank once, was being a troll during banning phase and being all kinds of rude, in game started flaming our bot lane and everyone agreed to report him. but instead im the one being reported. for saying this:\nGame 1\n-: get your facts right\n-: arhi coming\n-: dude how r u gold if u dont even pay attnention\n-: you W to heal\n-: dont gank me when im not ready\n-: help bot and be a useful jg\n-: theyre loisng\n-: i havent played ken in like 2 seasons\n-: hes bad\n-: can u plz bitch some more\n-: its called she got first blood and you gank shitty\n-: lol for sure\n-: hes afk now\n-: defs report\n-: someone type in all chat to report him\n-: i cant\n-: seriously tell the team to report\n-: now hes griefing and not helping team.\n-: afk, toxic, not helping team, what else?\n-: we cant its a 4v5\n-: lets just push top\n-: who said no\n-: or didnt say anything\n-: i hope yi gets banned from our reports\n-: oh another reason\n-: inting\nI had 3 comments I deleted because it said wiener, penis and vagina in it because they were saying those too. being very vulgar towards us. I said i had a vagina not a wiener. and they were talking about sizes and everything, anyway not the point. (yes i know i got reported for vulgar and swearing at your team mates) but to me its unbalanced that I got perma panned from saying these things when I wasn&#039;t the one who got us a loss and was the one actually doing reasons to get a report. both games my team mates other than them agreed to report. &quot;gank shitty&quot; I get perma banned. lol. unbalanced.","replies":[{"poster":"Scottez","date":"2018-04-10T14:09:29.678+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Riot believes we should all be emotionless robots and they decided that flame will have the same punishment, whether it is induced or not. Right now the state of the game is in this predicament where trolls aren't punished fast enough and so the people who are on riot's naughty list (anyone that has gotten a restrict) respond to these trolls and get punished regardless. I have said this before, no one is in the loading screen, looking to verbally abuse people, but trolls are in the loading screen already looking to screw over the game. There should be a cause for this as this seems to be quite common. How are you supposed to respond to a troll positively? Especially if you have a history of chat abuse (unfortunately that includes being *negative*). Something has got to change!","replies":[]},{"poster":"kaboomblah","date":"2018-04-10T13:12:35.641+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Man... to get banned over Normals.
