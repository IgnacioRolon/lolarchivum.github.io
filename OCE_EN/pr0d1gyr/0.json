I could use your thoughts. If there is someone i should choose 150% over these 2 let me know.\n\n[Edit] Thank you all for your feedback. Bought Zac, enjoying him a lot, definitely Vi will be my next grab around.","replies":[{"poster":"Geldour","date":"2014-11-23T19:36:48.266+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"{{champion:254}}","replies":[]},{"poster":"Devil God King","date":"2014-11-22T19:23:00.821+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Vi is far more common and probably more solid in a solo queue. Keen to see more Zac play though, however his passive requires greater synergistic coordination with team.","replies":[]},{"poster":"jesterbane","date":"2014-11-20T23:16:10.554+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I would go with Zac, his aoe sustain as said by someone else will be great in new jg, also he is such a fun champ to play. His ganks are great as well, and his passive is super strong. I would recommend him more :)","replies":[]},{"poster":"Knuuckles","date":"2014-11-20T21:34:16.488+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"zac works extremely well with the new patch with his 100% aoe damage and sustain, with the new jungle being quite difficult to clear i think that aoe/sustain junglers will slowly take over, also works really well with rangers smite","replies":[]},{"poster":"MadLifeJunior","date":"2014-11-20T21:21:02.619+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey there Summoner,\n\nBoth champions have are really strong. But for use in the jungle I suggest Vi over Zac as Vi's ganks are a lot more reliable. I personally think Zac is a top lane champion rather than a jungle. Vi has an extremely strong kit. She is one of those champions that just never really scales off and she never becomes useless in a game. Even if she is underfed Vi should still have no trouble ulting the fk out of their ADC. \n\nBut my best advice to you is to try them both. If one is on free week play around on him or her and get a feel for the mechanics and play style of that champion. If you like them then by all means purchase them, if not then you can always move onto the other champion or any other champion that pops on your list.\n\nKind Regards,\nlols","replies":[]},{"poster":"Taliyah","date":"2014-11-20T20:22:30.232+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"inb4 Blufire56{{champion:154}}","replies":[]}]}
