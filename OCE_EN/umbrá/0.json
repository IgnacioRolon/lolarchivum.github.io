The way he is in his current state is fucking unacceptable so these changes are aiming to fix that while keeping his identity without breaking him.\n\n1.) Zed&#039;s Shadows can now Auto Attack AND can also use his passive\n\n2.) Passive now doubles Zed&#039;s current lethality.\n\n3.) Shadow Slash now taunts for 2 seconds. And when the duration ends you&#039;re hit with 400 True Damage + 60% AD.\n\n4.) Death Mark is now global.\n\nI feel this will really define Zed who he is as a champion and these very SLIGHT buffs will help him escape his current state that he is in now but this isn&#039;t even close to what he actually needs.\n\nShoutout to Samizul, RiotZiegler, and CertainlyT for making the best and most mechanically challenging champion in the game.\n{{champion:238}}{{champion:238}}{{champion:238}}{{champion:238}}{{champion:238}}{{champion:238}}{{champion:238}}{{champion:238}}{{champion:238}}{{champion:238}}{{champion:238}}{{champion:238}}{{champion:238}}{{champion:238}}{{champion:238}}\n\n...Z{{item:3153}}E{{item:3153}}D{{item:3153}}Z{{item:3153}}E{{item:3153}}D{{item:3153}}Z{{item:3153}}E{{item:3153}}D{{item:3153}}Z{{item:3153}}E{{item:3153}}D{{item:3153}}...\n\nAlso on a side note if you the people at Riot games could update Zed's difficulty bar that would be GREATLY APPRECIATED \n\nhttp://i.imgur.com/54zkeaK.png\n\nEDIT:::; Due to popular demand I decided to do his other skins as well please enjoy&lt;3\n\nhttp://i.imgur.com/oZywNhu.jpg[/img]\n\nSKT T1\n\nhttp://i.imgur.com/q09Sxvj.jpg[/img]\n\nPROJECT:\n\nhttps://puu.sh/tGKMG/edaf005ea2.jpg\n\nAnd of course Championship.\n\nhttps://puu.sh/tGKUr/69f5a1aa68.png\n\nThank you for your time\nhttp://www.auplod.com/u/daopul5c344.png\n\nAs for a bonus I decided to write Zed pls enjoy ty&lt;3\n\n\n{{champion:238}}{{champion:238}}{{champion:238}}{{champion:238}}......{{champion:238}}{{champion:238}}{{champion:238}}{{champion:238}}......{{champion:238}}{{champion:238}}{{champion:238}}{{champion:238}}  \n.........................{{champion:238}}.........{{champion:238}}.................................{{champion:238}}.............................{{champion:238}} \n...................{{champion:238}}...............{{champion:238}}.................................{{champion:238}}.............................{{champion:238}}   \n.............{{champion:238}}.....................{{champion:238}}{{champion:238}} {{champion:238}}..............{{champion:238}}.............................{{champion:238}}    \n.........{{champion:238}}.........................{{champion:238}}.................................{{champion:238}}.............................{{champion:238}}   \n....{{champion:238}}..............................{{champion:238}}.................................{{champion:238}}.............................{{champion:238}}   \n{{champion:238}}{{champion:238}}{{champion:238}}{{champion:238}}......{{champion:238}}{{champion:238}}{{champion:238}}{{champion:238}}......{{champion:238}}{{champion:238}}{{champion:238}}{{champion:238}}\n\nAlso on a side note bring back AP Yi ASAP.","replies":[{"poster":"Fitzky","date":"2017-01-31T03:27:52.903+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'm taking that this whole post is a joke, also I think zed is fine how he is atm there's just a lot more op picks midlane like LB, Ziggs and even Vel Koz.

I've seen a full build Zed 100-0 tanks with that ult.\nI'll admit, I have very limited experience on the champion, but either every Zed I've seen has secretly been faker, or Zed seems to have a really easy time getting ahead, and being an absolute nightmare to deal with once there.\n\nUltimately, the fact that Zed can R back to his shadow after his ult for that very, very strong escape is why in my mind his stats and overall effectiveness deserve to be on the low end of high. Every other assassin would kill for something that reliable and that cheesey.\n\nLet's be real, Zed arguably could do WITHOUT being able to return to his R shadow, because his W shadow can already offer him an escape.\n\nOh hey, and you know... Flash... the summoner spell that millions and millions of players have popped to try and escape a Zed over the years, only to have Zed give 0 ducks and kill them anyway.","replies":[{"poster":"ROGU3","date":"2017-01-30T17:54:55.404+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Oh.... this post is satire, isn't it?","replies":[]}]}]}
