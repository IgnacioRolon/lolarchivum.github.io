Don't know if this problem exists in normals but every game I has at least 2 bots on either side. It makes the game unfucking playable, how is this existing in 2019. Is there even anti-cheat in this game that can detect programs? There are accounts that have 20 games + and keep on playing. The lvling is process is close to unplayable, I don't wanna play normals, I don't wanna play co-op, fix your shit riot.

The reason bots (and other 3rd party software infractions) are dealt with in this manner is to make it harder for the software developers to identify when and how the programs are being detected, thus making it harder for them to circumvent the detection methods Riot uses. Last I heard, Riot was testing new systems designed to match bots together and subsequently alleviate the strain on actual players. Once you hit level 30, you shouldn't have to worry about bots showing up in anything other than coops (and even if they do, it will be few and far between). When you do encounter them, a quick report will flag the account, and using the term \"bot\" in the report comment will flag it to be reviewed as such.","replies":[]}]}
