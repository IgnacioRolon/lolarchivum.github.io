Then i leave the screen in to the post-game screen and at the top where it usually says  LP gain and loss, it says not enough games played, nothing pops up on my screen and i think, thats weird. So I exit the screen and go to my profile, AND THERES NOTHING UNDER RANKED. It didnt even say how many provisionals ive done. Granted my internet dropped out so i it counted as a leave for one game counting as 2 losses, so i though that was the problem. But my duo partner says it only says ive done 7 out of 10 provisionals and im like ?!?!?. So I re-log and its still the same and i was so confused. So i start talking with my other friend and they say ive only done 7 out of 10 on their screen to and im like ?!?!?!?. Please help im so confused and if Riot could help me with this it would be greatly appreciated.

I don't recall any time that loss prevented was recently activated, but I do know of ghost games appearing occasionally, about three weeks ago.

You'll need proof of it, though.","replies":[{"poster":"Riso","date":"2015-02-14T04:15:19.985+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"But all those games are in my match history","replies":[{"poster":"HORSE OF FORCE","date":"2015-02-14T08:08:07.170+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Irrelevant, even though they may have been saved on your account, it could have not been saved on the league server.
