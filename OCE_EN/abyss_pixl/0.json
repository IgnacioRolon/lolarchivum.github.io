My parents have been divorced for around 12 years and I have been living with them both, so my time to play league has been small. A few weeks ago my mum moved to a completely different state without saying a word to anyone and I had no say if I wanted to go or not. In the eyes of the law it was seen my mum was kidnapping me, but she had no intent. My dad is currently in a huge court battle with my mum and I have not been able to play the game I love that cheers me up in any situation for weeks. It's hard to go to school and it's even harder not having a home to live in. This email is a bit long, but I just wanted to say thank you for the past few years of amazingly content and enjoyment. I have poured nearly 2000 hours into league and spent a bit of money to get rp, If I wasn't poor and not restricted to not get a job by my mother (I am 17 on March 20), I would have spent way more money to support Riot. I play on a 4-5 year old machine on low-medium, but the lag does not stop me, I just can't stop playing, but with the current situation I may never get to play league again, as my computer will be left in a completely different state (It probably only had a few months left in it :c )and I'm seriously bummed, but that won't stop me following the pro league and keeping up with the updates. Thank you Riot for this amazing game and I know it will continue to grow. One last thing if it's possible may this email be forwarded to Riot ToxicHawk, Toxichawk has been a huge inspiration to me on the OCE server. I met him in Bronze 3 when I started to main ADC, he was my support and I remember winning that game and adding him after. The support and help he gave me throughout season 4 has been a huge push to me climbing out of bronze and getting high silver. He is the sole reason I continued to main adc and because of him I enjoyed to game even more. He probably won't get this, but thank you so much for season 4 and I wish you best of luck in the future. Once again a huge thank you Riot for everything and I wish all the awesome Riot employees the best of luck.\r\n\r\nRegards Fujimotokureno of the OCE server!!!!","replies":[{"poster":"ToxicHawk","date":"2015-02-11T03:03:52.067+0000","up_votes":8,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey FujimotoKureno.\n\nFirstly I want to say, you are awesome.
