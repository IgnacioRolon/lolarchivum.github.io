When it happens I quit out of League then immediately log back in and its back to normal working perfectly fine. Does anyone know what I could do to fix this?\r\n\r\nThanks Raden","replies":[{"poster":"Wuks","date":"2015-12-23T04:09:55.241+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey Raden, \n\nPlease try the solutions provided in the [**Troubleshooting Connection Issues**](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues) Riot Games Support article!","replies":[]}]}
