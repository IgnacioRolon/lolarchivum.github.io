The upcoming assassin update is very serious and important to why I play this game, and especially why I enjoy playing this game. However, I&#039;m a little concerned with what Riot has given to us about what they want to do with kha&#039;zix, if it is nerfing his isolation damage or leap reset timer. \r\n\r\nIs it fair to expect that Kha&#039;zixs early level 6 power spike diminished in the following update?","replies":[{"poster":"Miicka","date":"2016-10-18T04:30:27.568+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Im not sure, this is just off memory, but I thought all they were changing with the Kha update is giving the player more of range of evolutions to choose from, so they can 'adapt' to the play style they need for the game instead of just always evolving q and e first cause they are the op ones :/\n\nI play a lot of Kha and while undoubtedly he is a little too strong at the moment I hope they don't completely change his kit, because he is already super fun to play.","replies":[]}]}
