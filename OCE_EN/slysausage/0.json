I am glad to see like minded people towards the system to be honest, im not saying it is all wrong, im not an angel i know but noone is, i do believe you should be learning to ban the right people tho, i do believe it should not be perma ban either ever, i do think that it should probably go from 14 day to 28 day to  56 etc, so therefor you can play another account for 56 days etc, i do not believe you should be able to perma ban accounts for whatever they do, i dunno but have any of you played on a real bad day not in the best mood play a ranked and boom top lane is 0-4 or mid etc, you would love to have helped but they dont give you a chance, sometimes patience is thrown out the window, sometimes... its wrong but it happens and therefor i do not see perma ban as a viable thing. Im not perma banned, 14 day do not mind at all, got alot of work stuff going on anyways but seriously things need to be changed. Mutes needa be 50 games and stuff before  ban for 14 day unless youre a right toxic %%%% flaming shit about their family etc \nThanks for takin the time of the day to comment fellas, appreciate it :P","replies":[]},{"poster":"Joiksu","date":"2018-02-07T16:01:29.758+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"Players that want to quit early after a few deaths are fairies for sure. Idiots like that need to learn how to play defensive, not go for kills when behind. Stop the bleeding so that their team has a chance to carry them. But yeah the common misconception in soloqueue is that a lot of people think that they have to carry every game and cannot adjust their mindset when they fall behind.","replies":[]},{"poster":"esp","date":"2018-02-08T15:19:09.262+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":3,"body":"Toxic af.
