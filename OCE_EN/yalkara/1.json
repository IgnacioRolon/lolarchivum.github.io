I have an average computer and internet, but sometimes, they just decide to play up for that _**15 seconds**_ which completely screws up my loading into the game. It doesn&#039;t help that the loading screen doesn&#039;t always notify when the client has frozen or is unresponsive, but the main thing is once I&#039;ve realized I have a problem, it takes so long to completely restart the client, login, and click on &quot;reconnect&quot;.\r\n\r\nWhy can&#039;t there be a button on the loading screen which allows fast-paced exiting of the game client back to the matchmaking/chat with an option to reconnect without having to re-login (I doubt this is a security issue seeing as I haven&#039;t actively logged out, and it&#039;s still on the same computer/IP).\r\n\r\nThoughts?","replies":[{"poster":"Omni Presents","date":"2016-05-21T14:16:17.428+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I just press Alt+F4 on loading and it puts me back to the Reconnect button instantly.\n\nOr is that when I quit while in game?
