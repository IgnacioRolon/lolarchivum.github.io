People who want to climb are the scourge of the game and want them to leave. \n\nIt makes absolutely no sense to me but I feel you. Played 10 hours today and in all that, only 1 team that wasnt all hardcore feeders.

(technically more likely the opponents int) and I dont see you saying you should not get LP if the opponents intentional feed.

At the end of the day RIOT is a company which needs players to keep playing, good or bad.\n\nThe more time you play this game, the more RIOT will make money off you in the long run.  I suggest to create games with friends or go to a net cafe where more players play together. \n\nThat way you dont have to worry about playing randoms.","replies":[]}]}
