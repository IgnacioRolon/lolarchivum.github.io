Riot needs to stop putting players with massive skill differences in the same games. I&#039;ve had multiple games where there are challenger players in one team and unranked ones in the other, the latter playing like they&#039;re relatively new to the game. Yes they were normal games, but I don&#039;t find them enjoyable in any way.\r\n\r\n&quot;Speeding up queue&quot; argument seems counter-intuitive. I&#039;d rather wait for a 5 - 15 minute queue than waste 30 minutes in a horrible game where one side feels bored and the other hopeless.","replies":[]}
