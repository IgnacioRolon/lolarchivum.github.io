Not sure what I&#039;m doing wrong. Last year during Preseason i got from Bronze V to Silver IV, now all of a sudden I&#039;ve seem to have gotten really bad or something. Or maybe Bronze IV is just harder? Because I remember I was stuck in this tier last season and as soon as I got to Bronze I things started getting really easy. I&#039;m not saying there&#039;s an Elo hell or anything, I&#039;m just saying I may need to work extra hard if I want to get back to silver. \n\nSo, I&#039;m trying to figure out what I&#039;m doing wrong. In order to help me with this, I&#039;ve decided to document every single match I play, like a journal. I&#039;ll describe champion select, the match itself, and the mistakes I&#039;ve made along the way. Hopefully by being hyper critical of myself I can improve. Since I will be writing this journal, I thought it&#039;d be fun to post it on these forums. I&#039;ve seen this kind of thing been done before, and from a reader&#039;s perspective, I find it very interesting to see an individual&#039;s journey through rank. If I can make it out of Bronze, perhaps I can inspire others to do the same! If I can&#039;t make it out of bronze, well that&#039;s life isn&#039;t it? Fact stands, there HAS to be people in Bronze. xD\n\n**Match One: Mid as Veigar**\n\n_Champion Select_\n\nLots of communication happening here. That&#039;s good. People were actually discussing strategies, and we&#039;ve got a Sejuani who&#039;s really strong at the moment. :)\n\n_Summary of Game_\n\nRiven: I never riven.... (Me: YOU CHOOSE UNTIL NOW TO TELL US? lol)\nJinx: First time Jinx. (Me: Are you guys trolling?)\nBlitz: FML\n\nVeigar vs. Viktor was a bit of a struggle for me early game. Neither of us were winning lane for a while. We we&#039;re both low so I pinged for a gank, only to realize Sejuani was too behind and would feed so I called it off. Jinx responded to the gank request by saying; \"If you can&#039;t mid, give it to someone else.\" Okay? Gosh, I was even in CS and health with the other guy, just because I&#039;m not a miracle worker doesn&#039;t mean I shouldn&#039;t go mid. Not to mention it&#039;s bronze. We&#039;re meant to be in Bronze because we&#039;re ALL bad, not just me. Anyway, soon after that I became legendary and the rest, as they say, is history.  (I won)\n\nLP: 18","replies":[{"poster":"Simuseb","date":"2015-04-07T11:40:56.281+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Match Two: Jax\n\n**Champion Select**\n\nOkay, to be honest I didn't pay enough attention to give a proper summary. I do remember saying that Jax isn't as strong as he used to be anymore and there are better bans. \n\n**Game Itself**\n\nI was rubberbanding that whole game. I lost. Couldn't play despite 50 ping. Wtf. lol\n\nLP: 01","replies":[]},{"poster":"hðnkƒørÇªmíllè","date":"2015-04-07T10:59:13.193+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It'd be more beneficial to record your games using Riots official replay system (coming soontm) :^) No but actually recording your games and analysing them afterwards, looking at your mistakes, their mistakes, what you can do to improve, will benefit you A LOT.","replies":[]}]}
