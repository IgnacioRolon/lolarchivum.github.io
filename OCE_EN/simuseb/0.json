It was like that for a good three minutes, and my internet was fine, so I decided that the game must've ended without me and that's why I couldn't connect. Then I closed the client and... wtf, the game doesn't even exist anymore! It's not a ghost game as I can join the queue, but it's not showing up in match history. What's happened? It was a provisional match so I want that win to count... :/","replies":[{"poster":"HORSE OF FORCE","date":"2015-01-23T05:20:07.472+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"What does your ranked history say?
