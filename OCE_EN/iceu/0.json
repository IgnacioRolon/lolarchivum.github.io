And then that happened again during my rank game, i was trying to do some exchange by using e  q on a minon and enemy  malzaha was right next to it, i also got the third stack with me, he got knocked up, but it also didnt do any  damage to him, i used the minon to get close to him so i am sure he didnt take any damage from my q, but he did got knocked up, so is it a bug or they really dont take damage if they are on the edge of it","replies":[{"poster":"noogai","date":"2015-11-10T12:18:55.493+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yasuo's E and Q interactions have always been a little buggy. For example, sometimes when I E+Q straight away, it doesnt do the Q at all and simply E's me to the destination, leaving me in a bad situation because people have reacted and moved before I can reposition for a good Q.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Talon12","date":"2015-11-10T06:42:33.806+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"ye its a bug and it happens, report it they don't do anything\n\nreported it like a month ago along with the other 2 bugs, still haven't done anything","replies":[]}]}
