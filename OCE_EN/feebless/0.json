I usually play on the OCE server, even though I have 220 ping constant.I can play normally on this ping.\nWas until a week ago when I noticed that my ping rose to about 350 to 400 ping. This made the game literally unplayable as I couldnt cs as there was a literal 1 second delay to everything I did.\n\nP.S my ping on NA server is normal as before, this only happens on Oceania and I have checked with my ISP about my internet and it was totally FINE\n","replies":[{"poster":"HORSE OF FORCE","date":"2015-03-18T11:24:19.714+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Have you tried any of the optimisation that Riot have suggested, such as closing all other applications before playing, changing your DNS to Google's public one and using a wired connection?\n\nWhat OS are you on?

Averaged 160-180 when the servers started (which beats my NA ping of 200), after they made some changes to the routing, it went up to about 220, which was still manageable. Now recently they seem to have made some changes again, and I sit on 350 average ping, which is pretty unplayable. :|","replies":[]}]}
