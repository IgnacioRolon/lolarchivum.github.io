So I set that up. Next game I&#039;m playing Brand, and I don&#039;t want my Ult on quick-cast. I have to remember to open the menu and change the options every game._\n\n****\n\n**Don&#039;t get me wrong, it&#039;s not that big of a deal and its habitual at this point, but I feel it&#039;s something that could make play a little smoother.**\n\n All you&#039;d need is a few small files (one for each champ) on the client side to read off which abilities are quick-cast.\n\nI don&#039;t know how many times I&#039;ve gone from playing a champion I don&#039;t want to quick-cast my ult on (Lets say Jhin), then next game I&#039;ve played someone I really want to have it on quick-cast (Zilean). If I forgot to turn the ability back on quick-cast then I&#039;d be standing there trying to ult and wondering why nothing happens, potentially losing a team fight or what have you.\n\nNot game breaking by any means, its just something I&#039;m amazed hasn&#039;t become a thing yet.\n\n****\n\nThis also carries over for items as well. Imagine one game you&#039;re playing someone like Akali who you&#039;d build a gunblade on. You put the item into your second slot because thats the one that&#039;s easiest for you to press. You figure it&#039;d be easier and faster to quick-cast it than to try and press the button then click on the enemy, so you go ahead and set your second item slot to quick-cast. Good on you for making a decision to try and improve your play. The next game you end up playing a support so you do the right thing and buy a sightstone, and place it into your second item slot because you&#039;re most used to using that key for actives. Your team is trying to secure an objective and you go to place a ward over the wall, but low and behold its still on quickcast and you place it in front of the wall. _(You then all die to a blast cone gank by the enemy team because you had no vision. Not necessarily part of the example but entirely possible)_.\n\nThis is just the kind of thing that&#039;s make the game a little nicer to play, as I don&#039;t have to worry about my keybindings being setup for my champ every game.\n\n****\n","replies":[{"poster":"Estevacio","date":"2017-10-10T23:11:06.695+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"are we alone in this quest?lol , HOTS uses it, Smite as well , would love it here too!!","replies":[]}]}
