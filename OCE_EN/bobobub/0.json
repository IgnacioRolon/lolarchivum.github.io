There is no reason to ever do that. \nEspecially if they aren't playing well, because then they are probably feeling terrible about themselves already, and the last thing they need is your self-righteous ass screaming at them. Thats 100% more likely to make them play even worse.\n\nWe all have bad days and bad games, some players can't play certain champs well, and some players are actually just worse than most in general. That doesn't mean they shouldn't be allowed to play.\n\nWe have ALL been a drain on the team at one point or another, and I can absolutely guarantee that you have too.\nI had a game recently where I went 0/13 on Azir _(my bloody main, who I have played loyally since the day he came out)_, I have no idea what happened, my playing just went to shit that game. Do I deserve a ban?","replies":[]},{"poster":"esp","date":"2018-10-18T10:19:16.285+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"There's nothing casual about league of legends. Normal/aram whatever, All game modes are treated the same.. An obvious int for e.g like 10 deaths at 10 minutes would probably catch a ban. let me correct that, it probably won't even catch a ban, It will catch a Chat restriction depending on the tier of penalties you're on/had. In ranked if it's for e.g 7 deaths at 14 minutes which is a death every 2 minutes.. I don't think system would detect an int. System doesn't care about gameplay 90% time. It's probably a statistical analysis over a duration of time.. like damage done,damage taken, deaths, gold etc shit like that. (i'm assuming)","replies":[]}]}
