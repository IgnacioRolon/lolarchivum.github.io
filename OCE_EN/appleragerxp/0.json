It turns black and says \"There was an unexpected error with the login session. Please try again.\" So I watched a ton of youtube videos on how to fix it, read a ton of boards. I've restarted countless times. I have changed my DNS, but once I change my DNS, it says that it is not responding and cuts my wifi off, even though I'm 100% sure it's the right code. Please someone help!!!","replies":[{"poster":"XiaoZhengTai","date":"2019-11-08T10:23:45.162+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Try modifying your firewall level to low.
