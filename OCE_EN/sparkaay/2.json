I play for fun after school and don&#039;t have much time as i do Year 11 VCE and need a lot of study time, due to the low priority queues, it makes it hard to study because i waste 20 minutes of non play time waiting. Once again i am getting these punishments and i want them resolved immediately. I believe teammates are falsely reporting me and resulting in this.\r\n\r\nP.S, Don&#039;t  accuse or tell me i have been inactive during a game and don&#039;t tell me Low Priority Queues can&#039;t be removed. Because this terrible system needs to be fixed, it&#039;s not helping whatsoever. People will just put a timer on a couple minutes before and just come back, it&#039;s just giving them a break off the game, not punishing them.","replies":[{"poster":"HORSE OF FORCE","date":"2015-05-07T11:50:50.777+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":">due to the low priority queues, it makes it hard to study because i waste 20 minutes of non play time waiting\n\nSolution: study while waiting.\n\n>I believe teammates are falsely reporting me and resulting in this.\n\nLeaverbuster is completely automated! It doesn't take reports into consideration when giving out penalties. All it looks at is how many games you've left in the past and how recently.\n\n>don't tell me Low Priority Queues can't be removed\n\nLow priority queue will not be removed under any circumstances. This is to prevent corruption in the ranks (and to stop the flood of low priority queue removal requests).\n\n>Because this terrible system needs to be fixed\n\nThat rings truth.\n\n>People will just put a timer on a couple minutes before and just come back\n\nThere's actually a lot of deep psychological tricks that Riot have probably explained somewhere in a presentation you could look up on the internet, but in essence what it does is lower the damage that consistent leavers can do.\n\nI'd say that you should focus on your studies. What you get in VCE will often dictate what courses will be available to you in your future education/career prospects. Work hard now, and it will pay off in the future.\n\nLeague is just a game. Don't prioritise it.","replies":[]}]}
