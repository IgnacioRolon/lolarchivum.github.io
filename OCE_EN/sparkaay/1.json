FIX LEAVERBUSTER","subforum":"Help & Support (OCE)","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I don&#039;t like how the last 2 patches i&#039;ve been having problems, constant attempting to reconnect spikes, then takes me out for inactivity. LeaverBuster is too strict and doesn&#039;t know its right and wrongs. I shouldn&#039;t be punished for your servers or your bad patch, i constantly keep getting 5 low priority queues for 20 minutes. I can&#039;t wait that long again for 5 games. It is ridiculous for running my computer for an extra 100 minutes just to wait for a punishment i didn&#039;t cause. It happened just last game and disconnected me and we still won the ranked game, my teammates weren&#039;t bothered with the inactivity because they believe they are experiencing the issues also. I want something to happen to these queues. Maybe remove these 5? It&#039;s really frustrating how i still participate with no problem and help the team win and still get low priority queues. I don&#039;t want a reply saying you need to address this issue by fixing it in custom etc etc. I play for fun and mainly winning. I especially don&#039;t like it when teammates are afk and we lose from it. Those are the ones who should get severely punished.\r\n\r\nWanting a response asap. I&#039;m not going to wait the 20 minutes x 5 out.","replies":[{"poster":"Super Euro Flash","date":"2015-04-11T12:17:47.214+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"CHAIN DISCONNECTIONS IS NO ONES ISSUE BUT YOUR OWN.
