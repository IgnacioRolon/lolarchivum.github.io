And now I've realised what a mistake that was. I've never touched the champ, and I can't refund the skin because it wasn't recent enough. After seeing the new star guardian skins, I've really wanted to get star guardian rakan. But I can't afford to buy it lmaoo. So do you think that it would be possible for me to exchange the skins? They're both 1820 RP, and I've never played with the riven skin. But if not, its totally understandable because it seems dumb to request lol.","replies":[{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2019-11-24T03:09:37.281+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I would say chances are unlikely, but if anyone can help you it's player support: https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/requests/new\n\nIf you still have refunds available they *may* be able to manually exchange the skins and comsume one of those.","replies":[{"poster":"Drakenoid","date":"2019-11-25T09:08:53.155+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"contacted them about it and unfortunately they can’t exchange it :/ my fault for getting a riven skin lmaoo.
