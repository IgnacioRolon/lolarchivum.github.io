Anyways the post i made about this situation has been removed by you guess it... RIOT. probably because i was correct and they dont like people bitching about problems THAT THEY CAUSE. but yeah we need to all stand up against this stupid company and get our accounts back. Technically its illegal that riot take the money you have spent on your account after they ban you, if you arent in possession of the champions and skins you purchased anymore then riot either has to refund you the money you spent, transfer ALL of your purchases to a new account for you or just not ban your account in the first place.

With that in mind it's not as if the same consumer laws that would apply to something like a toaster (for example) you buy outright would not necessarily apply to this situation (even disregarding the difference of \"medium\"). Rather, it would be more akin to renting that toaster (which is something that many businesses do) and bottom line is that if you damage that toaster through negligence and/or intentional acts they'll make you pay to fix/replace it (which is something that will be included in the relevant agreements).","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"QAPLA","date":"2018-05-23T23:22:52.052+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"People get banned for breaching Terms of Service, they have no legal recompense, so just give it up now.","replies":[]},{"poster":"QAPLA","date":"2018-04-24T03:08:08.565+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=PepsiNext,realm=OCE,application-id=T8eq2lFQ,discussion-id=eut5JmQA,comment-id=,timestamp=2018-04-23T09:14:16.726+0000)\n>Technically its illegal that riot take the money you have spent on your account after they ban you\n\nNo it's not.
