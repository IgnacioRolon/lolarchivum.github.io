Without time to dodge or change summoner spells I was stuck in a game where my team had intentionally trolled me. I made the decision to feed in this game. I do think feeding should be bannable however I don&#039;t believe I should be punished for retaliating to my team putting me in a situation like that. I received a 15 day temp ban despite playing thousands of games and having very rarely behaved poorly.","replies":[{"poster":"IngÃ©nue","date":"2017-11-01T22:40:16.749+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"While it does suck to be put in that position where you are forced off your role by jerks in lobby, your best bet is to stick out the game  while playing your best. Once you end the game, you can report the unsportsmanlike players and they will get their accounts flagged for review. Just as you got judged by your actions, they will get judged for theirs. \n\nWhat you shouldn't do, is intentionally feed to \"retaliate\". It not only ruins the game for those 4 players on your team (even if in your eyes they deserved it), but also for the 5 enemy players. People know what it likes to have int feeders in the game and you will find its a type of player that the majority of the community doesn't want to be playing the game. \n\nAs for the punishment, it typically escalates in tier:\n\n*  10 game chat restriction\n* 25 game chat restriction\n* 14 day ban\n* Permanent ban\n\nDue to the fact it was your actions that were deemed unacceptable by fellow players, it doesn't make sense to chat restrict you so you went straight to a temporary ban. Take this time to think about how you can behave in future situations if this kind of thing happens again, since your next punishment will be a permaban.\n\n> You can formally appeal by sending in a ticket to [Riot support](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/requests/new), although bans are only lifted if they were applied in error. In your case one would confidently state that it was an accurate ban so you are probably going to end up serving your punishment either way.

If you want to retaliate, you need to play the system and not fall into the system's trap. \n\nThe trick is to do it passive aggressively. And to NOT use chat at all, no matter how much you want to. Maybe the occasional \"<3\". \n\nIn this situation, I do different things depending on my role:\n\nIf I'm Jungle, I just AFK farm and don't gank. You can't get punished for not ganking, and out-csing the laners wouldn't be seen as trolling, and they can't ban you for feeding if you have no or minimal deaths. \n\nIf I'm Support, I usually play something like Morgana anyway, so I max W and build AP, take all the CS, and leave the ADC to fend for themselves in fights, and then split push. Again, minimal deaths, decent CS... you won't get banned for that. \n\nIn any other position, I just do my best not to die in lane (not looking for trades but farming when I can), and then just split push all game.\n\nSplit pushing in general is good, because the system reads you doing damage to objectives, so it thinks you trying to win the game.
