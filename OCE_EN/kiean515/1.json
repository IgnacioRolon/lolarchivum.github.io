But I ran over to some gameplays and spotlights and I found out that Nidalee and LeBlanc could also fit my playstyle, so I would like you guys to share you thoughts about this, any help would be gladly appreciated.\r\n\r\nFYI. My favourite lanes are mid and top, that may help answering my questions.","replies":[{"poster":"DiamondAries","date":"2015-02-28T12:32:16.793+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"LeBlanc, super mobile, bursty, and has dukes for days with distortion and flash.\n\nTalon, assassin, bursty, with pretty good ganks due to Ult and blink abilities\n\nNidalee, don't know what I would say about Nid, she has a poke that can easily deal 1/4 hp damage to most champs, an ult that changes her into an executioner once you hunt a champion, and she comes with free wards. Also has a heal, so pretty versatile if you ask me","replies":[]},{"poster":"Kiean515","date":"2015-02-28T08:58:04.452+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thanks to all those who answered, it seems like that the majority of u guys prefer Talon,  so I think I'll hold on to my ip and wait until I get 4800 to get him, thanks again","replies":[]},{"poster":"Olee","date":"2015-02-27T06:19:12.897+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"So, Talon. Firstly, it's never a good idea to pick an AD mid laner unless you know you got magic damage elsewhere. But, Talon is super duper strong right now and is actually a lot more versatile than he seems. He is easily the best teamfighting assassin in the game but he splitpushes really well also. He is also the easiest of the three and honestly, due to the fact that most victories in solo queue are decided through teanfights, Talon might be your best bet.\n\nLeblanc. I absolutely love LB. SO much. One of the strongest laners and probably one of the highrst bursts. She also has safety mechanisms, CC and a mother%%%%ing %%%%tone of mobility and damage. But, she falls off slightly and is actually pretty brain hurting to play, but ridiculously rewarding. \n\nNidalee. Now, I personally, am not a big fan of MIDalee. But she IS pretty versatile. Can be an assassin if you land spear and can be a mage if you just spear. also has ridiculous heals and is pretty mobile. But the spears have like 1 in a million chance to hit.","replies":[]},{"poster":"TrashDonnut","date":"2015-02-26T11:32:12.334+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Nidalee is broken atm.\n\nLeBlanc has high burst but only in the early game.\n\nTalon is great.","replies":[{"poster":"life for life ","date":"2015-02-26T13:40:32.580+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"lol LEBLance and still delete adc very easy which is help full  to the team. and nid is some what not very use full in team fight","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"life for life ","date":"2015-02-26T13:39:05.390+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"{{champion:7}}  is easy to play all u do is q then jump on them.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Slim Chaedi","date":"2015-02-26T11:40:23.306+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Gonna say Talon, because he has a not-too-difficult kit to get used to, and he has the stealth which is just nice when you are learning the game.
