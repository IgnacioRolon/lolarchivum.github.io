But I think that I shouldn&#039;t rush playing ranked since I would probably suck if I do. So what do I need to do before I go to ranked? Also if I am going to start Ranked, is it alright if I main Zed and Yasuo Mid? Because someone said and its not a good idea to use an AD mid unless u got magic dmg somewhere else. Also will Riven/Gangplank Top, Skarner/Master Yi Jungle, Kalista/Tristana ADC and Blitzcrank/Leona Support be a good roster to play Ranked? Any help will be gladly appreciated.","replies":[{"poster":"The Spawn Man","date":"2015-09-08T14:02:08.561+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"My advice would be to master at least one champ for each position, and a second champion that you are fairly confident with for all positions as well. Then learn about their weaknesses and combos. Learn about other champions and how to play against them. Learn about team composition. And watch loads of videos online about how pros track their progress in game (such as farm by a certain time, or when you should be ganking etc).\n\nYou need to look at ranked as a learning experience. Don't flame others, or yourself. Ask for advice. Work as a team. Try and duo with someone who is understanding and helpful. Those are some general tips, but there are infinite resources out there for you to get more in depth answers from.","replies":[]},{"poster":"TeCoolMage","date":"2015-09-08T13:23:55.321+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The best you can do is ask your team and have very basic experience with at least one AP mid, there are a lot of people who understand the desire to play an AD mid (They're EVERYWHERE I kid you not)\n\n\nYou don't have to main only two champs, you can main more, and some can overlap (Lulu can be top, mid or support, AD or AP. She's a really good backup champ if you don't want to memorize too much)\n\nThe champs you main preferably should cover as many picks as possible, I'd say a good guideline is\n\nTop - Farm + Kill champ (e.g. Nasus + Darius)\nMid - Poke + All in (e.g. Ahri + LeBlanc)\nJungle - Gank + Clear (e.g. Lee Sin + Udyr)\nSupport - Offensive + Defensive (e.g. Blitzcrank + Soraka)\nADC - Kite + Damage (Ashe + Vayne)\n\nThat way you have at least one champion for most picks. Champions like Lulu and Ezreal are great and overlap so you don't need as much practice. If you're desparate, try \nLulu top, mid and support\nEzreal jungle and ADC (Yes, say hello to your old buddy, Runeglaive)","replies":[]},{"poster":"FISTFACE","date":"2015-09-08T13:09:42.908+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I would recommend getting good or decent at 2 different champs for each lane. Including learning 2 adc's and 2 supports just in case the champion you picked gets counterpicked. Also Asuo or Zed mid isn't bad as long as someone in your team is ap and has decent enough dmg.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Eustace Fysher","date":"2015-09-08T08:51:31.621+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Probably wouldn't hurt to learn an AP mid. Just make sure you have enough and full rune pages otherwise you will be at a slight disadvantage. \n\nYou could play a ranked game and see how you go and from there decide if you should carry on with the rest of your placement matches.","replies":[]}]}
