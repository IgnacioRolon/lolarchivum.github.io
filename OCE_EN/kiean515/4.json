But I ran over to some gameplays and spotlights and I found out that Nidalee and LeBlanc could also fit my playstyle, so I would like you guys to share you thoughts about this, any help would be gladly appreciated.\r\n\r\nFYI. My favourite lanes are mid and top, that may help answering my questions.","replies":[{"poster":"nerdzilla123","date":"2015-11-06T11:51:26.980+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"ok listen the best thing is to try the champion if they are on free but personally as a lvl 30 player I like nidalee I played talon and found him fun but not my style but nidalee is good if you want some on diverse who can fill every role and has massive build paths but its still your choice","replies":[]},{"poster":"HORSE OF FORCE","date":"2015-02-26T10:55:32.361+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"http://boards.oce.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/gameplay-strategy\n\nI know, this is labelled \"Help & Support\", but that isn't really the reason here. This is more to help people with technical difficulties rather than what champ you should buy.\n\nHope this helps.","replies":[]}]}
