With the roll out of this system we could be able to find out when a champion/skin is on special and is able to be purchased by us, because each week most of us are not bothered to look and open the store to see the weekly specials in the store, granted its on the first page but with the favouritism system we can see and receive in-client notifications that a skin or champion we have been waiting for is on sale. What do you guys think? Worth a try? or a waste of time and space?","replies":[{"poster":"Ingénue","date":"2019-02-15T23:53:13.732+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"In a recent (like 2 months ago)[ Ask Riot, they discussed wishlists](https://nexus.leagueoflegends.com/en-au/2018/12/ask-riot-honor-and-wish-lists/). \n\nBasically it is something they would like to do (since it does get requested a lot), but the way that they have built the store makes it pretty hard to create. At the moment they are doing some behind the scenes stuff that will hopefully make it possible for wishlists to be a store feature in the future ♥","replies":[]}]}
