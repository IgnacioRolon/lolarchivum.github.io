LoLReplay has been working for over a year and has recorded some of my best moments. But today, my game couldn't open and crashed every time I press reconnect. I can't get passed that screen. Then I realised I had to uninstall LoLReplay and then after, I pressed reconnect and miraculously the game loaded. I had over 20 kills that game and I'm really sad that wasn't recorded. I saw another person post something like this a few hours ago but I want people to confirm what this is. If anybody uses LoLReplay and it worked, then I don't know whats happening. Please fix this because I want to get back recording soon!\r\nThank you!\r\nYours Kindly,\r\nBoxBox Jnr","replies":[{"poster":"HORSE OF FORCE","date":"2015-02-26T09:57:16.457+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"This usually happens with LoLReplay when a new patch is released. Doesn't that usually mean that LoLReplay is going to release a new version to fix it?","replies":[]}]}
