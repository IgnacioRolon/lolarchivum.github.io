I have decided I want to get a new mouse but am finding a hard time trying to decide between the Steelseries Rival, the Razer Deathadder and the Logitech G502. I have a fingertip/claw hold and my hand measures 18cm from the top of my middle finger to the bottom of my palm. I play on no more than 2000dpi and I want a mouse with no acceleration problems. I play games such as League and CS:GO.\r\n\r\nI have heard that a lot of the community who buys Razer products break down in a couple of months, fact or myth??\r\nI have also heard that their software isn&#039;t the best either.\r\nProducts from Steelseries from what I&#039;ve heard are better and I haven&#039;t heard much about the G502.\r\n\r\nSuggestions would also be helpful, my budget is less than $120NZD.","replies":[]}
