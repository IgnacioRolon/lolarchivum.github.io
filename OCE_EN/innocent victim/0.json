Yeah it is a bit harsh, and yeah it is a bit condescending BUT that's not its main problem.  I have found myself being \"busted\" despite not having left a game. \r\n\r\nIn one game, I had about 1fps so I restarted my computer. Back after 5 minutes - we won the game. Then I had to type \"I agree\" in that notoriously patronising jail cell of a textbox. \r\n\r\nIn another game, following the recent patch, (patches always scare me, you never know when you'll have to reinstall the entire game), the game just randomly crashed and, despite reconnecting, I was \"busted\" again.\r\n\r\nI know that, technically, this means I've not been playing for a short period of time. But surely there's no need to bust someone if they come back, or were simply trying to fix the problems that you created. I find afks and ragequitters as frustrating as the next person, but I feel this new system is far too harsh considering it's not all that accurate.","replies":[{"poster":"HORSE OF FORCE","date":"2015-01-13T01:22:24.452+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Should be raised to fifteen minutes of inactivity.
