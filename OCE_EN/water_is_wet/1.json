Why is Gragas allowed a Cigar and Graves isn&#039;t?","replies":[{"poster":"Klavinmour","date":"2015-10-20T07:17:12.202+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Because they haven't gotten around to it yet. Gragas Esq. is a skin, Riot have just started releasing new skin splash arts.\n\nThere are a bunch of reasons why Graves had his cigar removed from his NEW splash art, and most of them come back to the same reason Karthus in his visual update had his skeletal features removed.\nIt's to maintain an even rating across all regions, so the game doesn't need to be edited to be slightly different and have whatever a certain region finds offensive not there for just them.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Excitidly Insane","date":"2015-10-21T15:03:04.148+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It's to do with cultural and regional differences. So that in any given tournament, the maximum amount of champions are playable.\n\nIn a region where tobacco products are not appreciated, Esq. Gragas would be disabled but Gragas himself would be playable.\n\nThis way, each champion can basically be played anywhere with the default skin at least.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Lord Sesshomaru","date":"2015-10-20T09:57:19.190+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Because Graves is based off clint Eastwood, and so is a role model. where as gragas is a fat drunkard that no one cares about.\npeople copy the behaviour of role models like clint eastwood, but they don't copy fat drunkards that no one cares about.\n\nnah but Klavinmour's comment is the actual answer.","replies":[]}]}
