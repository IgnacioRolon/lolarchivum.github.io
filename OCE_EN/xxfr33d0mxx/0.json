This is causing really op champions to just dominate without having to do much because they haven't been nerfed lately or just had a tiny nerf. A good example of this is Udyr. Udyr has grown in the new jungle to be a really tanky, fast clearing, game carrying, annoying as heck champion. All he does late game is split push and run back and forth to just stall. If you're alone you deal no damage to him but he does way too much back because he is really tanky yet just attack speed is good enough because his kit is way too simple yet op. In other words; {{champion:77}} ={{item:3070}} for his opponents. He is like a tanky melee version of Sona just heaps stronger in any situation.\r\n\r\nPlease look over this and maybe fix? \r\n\r\nAnyways thanks for reading, From xXFR33D0MXx","replies":[{"poster":"GoldenTomat0","date":"2015-02-23T09:41:41.852+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"so you want them to nerf udyr because you don't know how to play against him?","replies":[{"poster":"Unseen Predator","date":"2015-02-23T10:59:20.494+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=GoldenTomat0,realm=OCE,application-id=Ntey9fRZ,discussion-id=cUuYmyo2,comment-id=0001,timestamp=2015-02-23T09:41:41.852+0000)\n>\n> so you want them to nerf udyr because you don't know how to play against him?\n\nNailed it.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"MigalooHD","date":"2015-02-23T09:36:56.426+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Any champ can be strong if you play them right","replies":[]},{"poster":"Krethyan","date":"2015-02-24T12:26:10.564+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"lol, udyr has been doing that for the past 3 seasons, I think you just don't know how to look at your mini map and get pissed when he takes a tower and no one notices.","replies":[]},{"poster":"BladeSensual","date":"2015-02-24T08:25:52.285+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"nerf lee and j4. buff everyone else...","replies":[]},{"poster":"Crusader charlie","date":"2015-02-24T00:08:11.361+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"i hope you are basing this off more than one example because i cant play udyr for %%%%, so if you every went up against my udyr plays you would change your mind probs","replies":[]},{"poster":"Sackboy","date":"2015-02-23T13:53:40.680+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Am I missing something, I see no patch notes.","replies":[]}]}
