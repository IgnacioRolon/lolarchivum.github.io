Hello my name is Misery I've peaked at a rank of Gold 2 and i still really love this game but i don't know how to improve as much as i did years ago I've been playing for a solid 6 years many accounts have been terminated I've been banned on 3 accounts spend over 3K$ on league skins alone i really want guidance from a professional player about everything i can improve on I'd love some coaching I've been playing for ages and I've been noticed by no one everyone ignores me i get tilted very easily I'm like a 1v9 machine one game then next I'm tilted because of a mistake I've made i have really great mechanics but they would need improvement of course I've lost clash this year i feel terrible about myself i feel like i can't carry as many games as i can i run it down I'm frustrated with my team mates, I complain I'm toxic i can handle my toxicity i would do anything to improve this season I want to become Challenger this season and prove everyone wrong i have school tho sadly but I can play for as long as i can until my mental breaks, so if anyone has any person to reach out to that can help me improve as a Mid laner. I don't want to hear anyone's petty bullshit about i should play this that be a meta slave My Cassiopiea is clean i want to improve on Irelia that's a champion I'm struggling on and want to pick up for my third champion i can play.\nI need guidance i need someone that is a hyper aggressive mid laner as i am i like going for kills i like carrying i like showing that I'm the best i can be I'd love to be the best person i can become in League. All I'm focusing on is league but people hold me back schools holding me down i just want to play league this season and not focus on everyone else's pathetic bullshit. I want to break free of my elo shackles and prove everyone that underestimated me that there dog shit and will never compare to me in there life :)\nI'm not trying to be a Tyler 1 wannabe Faker wannabe i just want to be my own player i just want to become the best me i can be i just want to be consistently the best player i can ever be. And I've heard drop the ego so many times its the most bullshit sentence I've heard in my life my ego has nothing to do with the game i play. My mentality has nothing to do with my mechanics my ego is my power i strive off that shit. I've probably played over 50k games it feels like I've spent and devoted my life to become better at this game I'm not here to get boosted by a better player then me i just want to listen and learn now so if you are reading this and have anyone you can talk to that can help me improve at mid that would be greatly appreciated! I'd get into shit about the game but its not the games fault people that blame league for there losses / their team its really sad to see everyone going down that path this season everyone's getting a x9 left right and center i really want to help new players just as much as i need help. But I'm in no position to help anyone or coach anyone, at the moment some days there are good games some there bad but at the end of the day all i want to do is improve on the thing i love most (Feel free if you don't want to comment or anything that you can add my account on league I'll be accepting you can criticize me all you want if its constructive)","replies":[{"poster":"Fake G0D","date":"2020-02-24T13:11:51.133+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Just a player looking to improve sadly i can't help with that I'm not high elo.","replies":[]},{"poster":"SoupTurd","date":"2020-02-29T17:44:46.122+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Man I feel you. I've been playing since S3 and have noticed over time that while watching the pros play is really fun, actually playing has lost its luster -- and its not because of the core game play. The player base has always been incredibly toxic especially in lower elo but I believe the problem today really comes down to the reporting system. Reporting used to barely do anything. Now, you can get reported for doing nothing. Asking your team to surrender early, having a bad game, trying to stay out of bad situations where your teammates are caught out, not ganking a lane enough times for your team's liking, missing your stun. Whatever the situation may be you can get reported. If your team is losing and want to blame someone rather than the collective behavior, they will find any excuse to report you (if you are the weak link on the team or made a notable blunder). \n\nDespite what RIOT may claim, it really seems like there is little verification of behavior for reporting, and the system really operates based on to how many people in the game report you and/or how many reports you get in a certain time span (or # of games played). That seems to be how instant feedback really works. This makes sense because from a business standpoint it is not in RIOTs interest to actually spend time and money to develop a good verification system for reports. To really do this they would need engineers, programmers and big computing power to develop a comprehensive AI system that was fast. Doing all of this won't improve profits, so they probably automate it with very little thought given to the system, and air on the side of political correctness when it comes to chat (because you need to police online behavior apparently --- or censor it completely if you are owned by a Chinese company).\n\nIf you think about that $3k you've spend on the game across all those accounts... RIOT made a huge profit off of you because you opened more accounts and spent more each time you got penalized. There is almost zero cost for RIOT to get that $3k from you, if you just had one account you'd probably spend less. The business model RIOT has is actually quite brilliant because their customer acquisition costs are extremely low ever since the game popped in MLG, and the cost to keep customers is quite low as well. The issue is that it seems that as RIOT has grown it seems to have become more concerned with profits than game play. This could also be due to the Tencent acquisition of 97% stake in RIOT.\n\nBased on in-game chat as a suggestion of a 9 person report situation, you can get instant feedback after that game indicating that the reported player is punished. Whats worse is that ALL previous honor built up get destroyed by a single penalty. You can get honored at an high rate in the past, and because you end up playing with a team that gangs up on you to place blame -- all prior efforts and gains in honor is done. \n\nUltimately RIOT doesn't want you to have honor points from a business standpoint. They are giving you things for free via the reward system. This fosters an addiction. If you don't get reward benefits, you are more likely to either stop playing completely (rage quit haha) or you be more likely to purchase things with real money rather than rewarded essence/capsules. While it may be a generalization, a lot of younger gamers may be impatient to re-gain honor and thus would be more likely to buy things like that new OP champion (that will be banned in all games and then nerfed in 30 days) with real money disguised as RIOT Points so it doesn't feel like you're emptying your wallet.\n\nI would never let my kid play this game because of how Pavlovian it has become, the psychological addition is actually quite interesting, much like certain social media websites. Rewarding players for good behavior and punishing them for bad behavior isn't the issue, the real point of discussion is where do you draw the line for bad behavior and who's in charge of determining what and who to punish. Currently it seems RIOT plays god for its revenue generators and buddies (streamers and friends of employees), making these people immune to punishment. Whats worse is that there is suggestive evidence that RIOT has even enacted on unproven and baseless recommendations from streamers to ban innocent players. On the flip side (for us filthy casuals) RIOT has created a system of reward-punishment that is very intolerant of normal online gamer/community behavior, and employs a majority vote system to determine punishment. All of this is in an effort to migrate you from feeling good about getting essence/capsules to needing to replace that feeling with spending RIOT dollars.\n\nThis being said, the odds are against you. The best thing you can do if you still want to play is not participate and turn off in-game chat completely. This will reduce your chances of getting reported (not eliminate). If you find you are seething, and have a desire to flame in chat and can't because you disabled it...well maybe it actually is your fault and you are a toxic person deserving of your penalties. \n\nAs for the $3k... that's on you buddy. I wouldn't pay RIOT ten-cents. Chances are that people who pay for pixels on a computer screen either have tons of cash to burn, someone else's credit card, or aren't the best with personal finances. Don't expect RIOT to treat you different just because you have paid money to them. This isn't a customer-service business, they couldn't care less about keeping you happy, there is always another sucker willing to pay for pixels. \n\nAdditionally, the pros and big streamers usually don't pay RIOT. They get their skins for free from tourneys, RIOT gifts and such. This makes sense because every time they play the game, they bring in potential new customers or encourage spending by us filthy casuals. All those cool skins you see streamers drooling over in game... this is just advertising so plebs will purchase it. Albeit the \"advertising\" is not necessarily intentional but RIOT knows that putting skins in the hands of streamers is to the company's benefit, and streamers need to be kept happy to drive more profits.\n\nPersonally what I do is limit the amount of chatting I do and if I do chat, I'll be brief. Another thing is muting teammates if you want your chat enabled. Its not hard to tell when your teammates are trolling/about to flame-off on everything and everyone. Teammates start pinging question marks? No problem... mute everything (not just pings because its only a matter of time when they start goading you to flame war them). Teammates just watch you die and come in for KS? No problem.. just mute and wait for them to initiate/go in because they clearly can't be trusted or just don't have the same understanding of situations as you. Don't take the chance... just mute.\n\nTo get better, you need to re-think how you play around teammates. The game is as much about understanding when teammates others are trolling/raging/seething, as it is about the mechanics and strategy. Use pings to indicate your actions so your intentions are clear to all. Don't go into every fight you see, assess the situation and consider your teammates strength and skill as much as the enemies. Don't try and save teammates who have overextended. Don't try and make plays around teammates that have clearly let you down in past engagements. Find the strong player(s) on your team who aren't flaming and try to focus your efforts around them. You will be rewarded for these efforts. Some games aren't winnable because of being on a team full of trolls or just snowflakes who flame. These games are the games you are most likely to be reported for, so don't give excuses. Choose your fights carefully and wait for the troll team to engage before you do. If the team is split, don't fight unless its a definite win. Ping objectives, but don't spam. \n\nMost of all: don't call teammates out on anything because you will probably get reported despite their behavior. Don't tell people you will report them because they will spite report you (this can warrant a chat restriction btw, I've been reported for saying \"reported\" and it added to chat log count for a penalty). The community is filled with toxic players. I'm talking about the low-key int-ers, the good 'ol afk farmers and the snowflakes who start flaming and raging when you asked them to stop behaving poorly. \n\nDon't talk, don't read. If you watch streamers, they barely chat in game or pay attention to it. In addition, their morale is kept high as well because they can read the stream chat of fanboys which supporting their verbal flames. If you don't have fanboys, disable your in-game chat... its super toxic. \n\nKeep in mind that gaming can be used as a form of stress release. Life can be difficult and when gamer come home from a long day of taking sh*t from their bosses/teachers/peers they can become seething piles of rage that use any excuse in game to release their stress. In a way it's much healthier for them to do this than take it out on someone in real life. Don't get caught up in their rage. Disable/mute chat. Mute pings. Mute emotes. Mute it all and carry on. Also don't allow yourself to play like a troll just because you can't flame in chat. This is my advice to you having a better gaming experience. I think that if you can improve your experience, it will allow you to focus on learning how to improve your mechanics and strategy much quicker as you will form positive memories of good plays and moves.","replies":[]}]}
