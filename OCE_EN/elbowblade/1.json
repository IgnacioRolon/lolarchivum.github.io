At **'Champion Select'** giving 2 chances (much like re-roll option) for the players option to **'Vote-kick'** a player/s recognized as being a potential liability to the team. Often I have noticed in chat some players in the team recognize the username of a particularly abusive/uncooperative player who is very likely to throw the game. At this point most of us know we're facing very difficult odds due to this person. In ranked this is especially frustrating since to Queue dodge incurs such steep penalties, no one wants to do it. IF you could **'Vote-kick'** at **'Champion Select'** then the only person losing LP would be the kicked player who will be forced to learn to play better with others if they wants to rise in ranked at all.","replies":[{"poster":"SEKAI","date":"2015-02-12T04:28:40.893+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Great, Riot will now specifically create the feature just for you.\n\nSo we can kick you whenever we see you, good luck getting a game.\n\nThis is where this feature will MOSTLY be used, you like that?","replies":[]},{"poster":"JayQue","date":"2015-02-12T01:41:13.642+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"This leads to issues such as *that guy picked my lane, try kick him* and general grumpiness pregame. Not to mention duoques have a much better chance of booting since they just agree with whatever their partner will do. I don't think this will help in the slightest im afraid.\n\nSaying that, there have been many times when I would love this ability, just for when you read *haha im trolling guys, goodluck* in pregames, Still, don't think this is the answer","replies":[{"poster":"TrashDonnut","date":"2015-02-12T05:02:40.147+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Imagine having 4 premades and you're arguing about who called *any role*","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Schakle","date":"2015-02-17T01:10:12.075+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"That's just a terrible idea in every way... One in ten times it would actually make a game better, but what's to stop the guy from re queuing and getting matched with you again? Then the other 9 times it'll just be someone getting kicked because lol...
