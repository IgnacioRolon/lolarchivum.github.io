There are gap closing champions to think about. There are people who aren't good with dodging pulls. \nRemoving flash would be ridiculous. \nThis guy just straight up pointed out the champions that would be bad or next to useless without these spells, so... let's remove the spells..\nDoesn't make sense. \n\nFlash can be pretty punishing if you screw it up. Like messing up flashing over a wall when an entire team is chasing you, being baited and flashing under tower to secure what they think is an easy kill and taking turret shots for it, flashing into brush thinking you outsmarted whoever was chasing you and not realising it is warded. \nFlash can be rewarding but it can also be punishing. If you screw it up, you have to wait for that cooldown and while you wait, you might eat a death you could've flashed out of successfully.","replies":[]}]}
