Matchmaking system should never, NEVER, use any facet of  ELO rating systems  to determine match-ups. These systems are nearly always based on ASSUMPTION not on actual CURRENT data.\n\n2. LP reward for wins should not directly affect any players individual ranking. This system is unfair due to the player having no control with whom they are randomly teamed with. i.e if you are match-made with 4 guys having a bad day & all either play poorly or just troll & or intentionally feed you should not have to worry about LOSING LP. The only thing that should affect your LP loss or gain should be your  KDA  as well as  Role based objectives (which I will get into further on).\n\n3. The disciplining of negative behaviour should always be determined by at least 3 human beings, not an automatic program. Reasoning is required for correct judgement. Players that are under judgement should also have the opportunity to make a defense.\n\nThe methods I would use to Remedy the above mentioned are as follows:\n\na) Teams will always be matched equally according to the divisions of the players - gold for gold, bronze for bronze, etc. Duo teams will always be matched with the current division of the lesser of the two i.e Duo Gold & bronze will be match-made with bronze allies. i.e a Duo team of Gold & Bronze ranks will first have bronze allies and secondly vs a team with one gold ranked player on it. \n\nb) LP is rewarded for Role Based Objectives  which would be as follows.\n\n*  Assassins are rewarded based primarily on KDA (favoring kills overall) and secondly de-warding.\n*  Fighters are rewarded based primarily on Damage Received, secondly on KDA (favoring low deaths overall) and lastly on Tower Kills & Assists\n* Mages are rewarded based primarily on Total Damage done, secondly on KDA (favoring assists overall) and lastly on Summoner spell usage.\n* Marksmen are rewarded based primarily on CS, secondly on Total Damage done & lastly on KDA (favoring kills overall)\n* Supports are rewarded based primarily on Buffs, heals & Debuffs, secondly on KDA (favoring assists overall) and lastly on warding.\n* Tanks are rewarded based primarily on Damage Received, secondly on KDA (favoring assists overall) and lastly CC used on enemy champs.\n\nON a side note there are LP rewards also based on how each attack type is played.\n\n* Junglers for Neutral Minion kills.\n* Melee for Buffs, debuffs & heals received while in combat.\n* Ranged for Auto-attacks.\n\nc) Option in Client similar to spectate mode where you have a simple window showing a report of some kind and the option to watch a replay of the match with 3 vote options Yeah, Nay or Veto. A brief comment must be left as to why you voted how you did. Players will be rewarded RP for each vote that is justified by Riot rep review at the end of each week/month/season. Negative behaviour or troll voting results in Lost LP as well as IP or even ban for extreme cases.\n\nWinning/Losing a game does not directly adversely affect your ranking. i.e if you played your Mage mid role well, your LP gains from your gameplay style > your LP loss from losing match.","replies":[{"poster":"BarryButcher","date":"2015-06-04T02:38:29.459+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"So under this system, a split pushing Nasus who wins you the game even though the kills are like 15-40, the team would get fuk all LP because they were behind and still won the game.\n\nNah bro, try again.","replies":[{"poster":"Elbowblade","date":"2015-06-04T03:10:00.576+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=BarryButcher,realm=OCE,application-id=FjGAIbRv,discussion-id=qq4cEZ66,comment-id=0000,timestamp=2015-06-04T02:38:29.459+0000)\n>\n> So under this system, a split pushing Nasus who wins you the game even though the kills are like 15-40, the team would get fuk all LP because they were behind and still won the game.\n> \n> Nah bro, try again.\n\nWould depend on his role as well as his position m8.
