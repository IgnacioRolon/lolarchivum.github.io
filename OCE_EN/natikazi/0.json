I have always been pretty uptight when it comes to maintaining the integrity of my passwords, using different ones on different websites, not sharing accounts, creating strong passwords, so I'd like to hope that there was a security breach on Riot's side, but it is possible that it's not their fault. \r\n\r\nIt's just kind of strange that for a company of this size that there is no sort of 2 step verification to log in on a new device, or any email that is sent out if you log on a new device. I've already registered my phone number for when clash was around in OCE, so I would have gladly used 2 factor if it was offered. \r\n\r\nIs there any advice that anyone to give me that would help me help/prove my innocence and get my account unbanned?","replies":[{"poster":"Project Xayah","date":"2019-10-12T13:09:49.166+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"You'll want to submit an Account Recovery ticket to [Support](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/requests/new) (use the \"Recover my account\" option, you'll need to be logged out to do so). That will start the account recovery process, during which the Support staff will ask you a series of questions related to the account to help with verification (don't worry if you can't answer all of them, you just need enough to prove beyond reasonable doubt), any additional information not available via Riot or 3rd party services will help with this. If the process goes smoothly, they should be able to verify the compromise period, and reverse any actions resulting from that.\n\nOne thing to note regarding account recovery services is that any history of account sharing (in any form) may negatively impact your chances of successfully resolving the issue.\n\nAs someone who takes extra care with account security, you'd probably know how to handle a compromise situation, but I'll give you all the standard advice anyway. Definitely run an anti-virus scan with whatever software you're using on any personal computers you've used recently, it may not show anything but always best to check in these situations (I'd personally recommend Malwarebytes Anti-Malware [free] for manual scans, as it seems to pick up more than other anti-virus software in my experience, but up to you). Also a good idea to recommend the same for anyone if you've used their computer for LoL recently, in particular public computers carry extra risk in this way. \n\nAlso a good idea to check security for any important accounts, such as emails, banks etc. and I'd also recommend you check out the website https://haveibeenpwned.com/ as it is a great resource for tracking down compromises, particularly across multiple services.","replies":[{"poster":"Natikazi","date":"2019-10-12T14:34:39.207+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thank you so much for the help.

Without the details (which a 3rd party like myself won't get access too) there isn't really any other advice I can offer.

However looking at the OCE support forums over the last month, the amount of compromised accounts being banned for hacking/3rd Party program use is pretty insane. In my opinion this may have led to a few incredibly frustrated, innocent players having their accounts permanently banned. \n\nLooking at the posts throughout the forums it honestly seems to me that either; someone is running rampant through the OCE servers with hacking/cheating software (I actually had someone admit to hacking on one forum) or the Riot OCE servers have had a data leak. Either of which may be true however I believe the former to be more likely.\n\nAfter the responses I've received from various sources I know this post probably won't help my friend get his account back in any way whatsoever, however I feel like I need so say something because if this hacking, cheating then ban problem continues Riot may find a portion of their Australian audience leave the game for good.   \n\nTo be completely honest the fact that (making a slight assumption here) that Riot (a billion dollar company) is unable to either track login locations or determine suspicious activity from that data (if they can track it) seems a little silly. Like i said above though I don't think anything I say can help my friend. I do hope however that from bringing this up Riot could perhaps bring some methods of account security to the game, as to stop this from happening again. Because really as popular as this game is not having a simple security measure like 2 Factor Authentication is unacceptable.  *Also yes I know Riot has 2FA in development however the last update on that feature was 4 months ago. * \n\nTL;DR - Am frustrated that my friend ShroomJuice and other OCE players have been getting banned due to hackers, and think Riot should add more priority to introducing more security factors to the game. Because hearing \"it's your fault you didn't secure you account more\", when you did is really damn frustrating.\n\nCheers, KurtForrester :)","replies":[{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2019-10-22T04:10:42.553+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Sorry, I missed your comment because it wasn't a reply!\n\nIt's frustrating yes, but the policy for compromised then banned accounts is that they generally don't stay banned.
