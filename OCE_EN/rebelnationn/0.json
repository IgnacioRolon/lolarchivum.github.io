When there are instances of negativity like this it can result in chat restrictions and they are just meant as a heads up to be more mindful of how you use the chat in games. Chat should be used in a constructive manner to help your team. Things like arguing with, blaming and complaining about others when things go wrong doesn’t really help your team at all and just serves to further distract everyone from focusing on the game.\n\nIn the future, I recommend using chat only for when it will contribute to the success of your team. If you don’t have anything positive to say it really might be best to say nothing at all. In my games I prefer to instantly mute players that are being negative and then report them after the game. There just isn’t any reason you need to give them the attention they want and get dragged into their negativity. Also something I found helpful is to just say things out loud when I get tilted, that way I can vent a bit but I don’t disrupt the game for everyone. The reality is that you can’t control the actions of others but you can control how you react to them.\n\nIf you need help with anything else, let me know.\n\nLegendary\nPlayer Behavior &amp; Game Support\nJarvan IV Jungle\n\"For the King!\"\n\n\n\nis what they tell me in that game i was not attacking or being toxic to any one my apc was crying about who i was playing   YUUMI a new champ at the time testing runes and items  and then she goes on bashing are mid lane where in there did i blame   complain or arguing thats 19 messages in a 45 min game.\n\nleague has a automatic program that if you cus or any type of inappropriate word is used you have a chance to be punished for.\n\nin the league client under settings> chat and friend.   there is a option there on default its on enabled language filter.   by clicking it off you are opting out of that knowing you will be subjected to language and are able to now use language.\nwith it on you cant see others language even if they have it disabled so by doing so you should not only be aloud to use \"cus words\" but you should never be punished using them other then in a way to belittle others. \n\nso deal league of legends fix your flawed system because now its getting stupid where you are spoon feeding 10 yr olds that its against your TOS for them to play Knowing your TOS  there is a age requirement. there is a language filter option and accepting both of them you should not be punished for language {{item:3690}}","replies":[{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2019-05-27T09:14:02.119+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"There's a lot to unpack here but I'll start with the key points:\n\n1. The automated detection is server specific, so behaviours that wouldn't see you punished in OCE, might in NA. What is or isn't punished is driven by player reports and cultures can differ quite drastically between regions. While we can offer the basic information and a direction, punishments for specific behaviours may vary. \n-\n2. You have only given game 2 from your chat logs. Your game 1 (and game 3 if there was one) logs also relevant to your punishment, so if you want accurate community feedback, you will have to provide the complete logs.\n-\n3. Two wrongs don't make a right, especially when you are dragging 3 other completely innocent people into in. Defending yourself is one thing, and while rarely productive, won't see you punished. Retaliation on the other hand (which is what you demonstrate here), is not ok, and can warrant punishment.\n-\n4. The language filter (and/or mute button) do not entitle you to abuse other players. To start, barely any of the language you used here would be filtered but it is all negative. Second, if you have to mute someone then the damage is already done. Third, just because no-one saw you steal a TV, doesn't make it suddenly legal to do so, and the same applies here.\n\nGiven you are from NA and didn't provide your whole log I won't delve any deeper as I don't want to give potentially false or misleading information.","replies":[{"poster":"RebelNationn","date":"2019-05-27T16:00:46.660+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"that was the whole log  besides what the other said","replies":[{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2019-05-28T04:43:10.879+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It wouldn't say game 2 if there wasn't a game 1 to go with it.
