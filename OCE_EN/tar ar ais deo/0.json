Kinda annoying when trying to throw a lantern and don&#039;t know the range that I can stand without my allies taking my lantern. Is anyone else getting this?","replies":[{"poster":"Wuks","date":"2015-12-05T23:08:53.766+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey tar ar ais deo,\n\nCan you try [**Repairing Your Client**](http://www.wrenchmen.org/resources/knowledgebase/1?view=article) and see if the problem persists afterwards?","replies":[{"poster":"tar ar ais deo","date":"2015-12-06T01:36:05.376+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Just repaired my client and went into custom games to check. Still bugged. The range of the lantern will flash for a second every two seconds. As I'm about to step out of the range it will flash again for a second. So weird.","replies":[]}]}]}
