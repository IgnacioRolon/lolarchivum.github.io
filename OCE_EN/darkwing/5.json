He hasn&#039;t got the mobility/escapes/cc to counteract the assassins that just !@#$ him, another thing is champions like braum and yasuo who can deny a projectile the size of the enemy base. I understand being able to deny it but it can be done in other means. He can&#039;t sit in bushes he litterally can&#039;t I think maybe they should make it that once they are hit by the passive they can see them rather he can always be seen.\r\nNow other matters are that he doesn&#039;t fit into the meta anywhere else I have had enough games with him to say I have tier 5 with him and he can&#039;t be played anywhere viably besides in the jungle and it frustrates me that when they finally hype it up and release &quot;ao shin&quot; the first dragon champion, **HE ISN&#039;T META MATERIAL**, please do something about this riot I love this champ and the idea behind him but he just isn&#039;t usable against the current meta.{{item:3070}}","replies":[{"poster":"Klavinmour","date":"2016-03-28T08:51:52.519+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":1,"body":"Riot have no control over the meta at all.\nThe meta is entirely determined by players and what they feel like spamming in ranked.\nIt may somewhat be influenced by small buffs and changes, but end of the day it's players who control the meta.\n\nRiot can't change champion designs or release dates just to correlate with what the current flavour of the month is.\nJhin fails in this meta as well, why aren't you complaining about that?","replies":[{"poster":"Lord Sesshomaru","date":"2016-03-28T10:06:44.347+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"This ^","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Nijel","date":"2016-03-30T04:15:18.461+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"People have thought many champs had no place in League on their release but after a couple weeks or months (and sometimes seasons) they usually find their place in the spotlight.

Hoard gold and magical items. Relax, sit back in lane and be passive for hundred of years at a time...

He's a jungler/top laner. He's a great top for when you have an AD mid, since a lot of tops aren't really assassins. He does well against bruisers, since he's more of a sustained damage than a burst. His jungle ganks are also pretty insane, being able to gank from red to lane with a gigantic stun.","replies":[{"poster":"Lord Sesshomaru","date":"2016-03-28T10:45:35.162+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I would beg to differ there, i was under the impression he was more of a mid laner. \nFirstly his amazing roam potential is wasted in top lane, as mid is the hardest lane for him to gank from a side lane, while top and bot are more productive and easier for him to gank AND both lanes are within range from the mid lane (unlike top).\nSecondly, you said yourself that the worst thing for him is a high damage melee champ up close in his face, and while Yas and Zed are pretty popular atm you're still going to find wayyy more high damage melee champs in top (after all thats kind of what top lane is most of the time) and while the aforementioned champs are popular, the majority of mid lane is still mages (unlike top, where the majority are high damage melee champs). Plus his two first items are tanky ones, and he has an aoe stun so he is actually less vulnerable to assassins than the majority of mages despite not having an escape) \nHe only does well against bruisers if they have no gap closers and can be cc'd by his rylai'd stars easily, but unfortunately most buisers in the game have a gap closer or some way of dealing with his permaslow, Garens Q, Darius' E, Mundo's R/Q, Elise's.. well everything, Fiora's Q, Jarvan's Q (not to mention his R makes sol pretty useless to anyone in it) Lee's Q/W, Riven's.. everything. Olaf's R/Q Trynd's E, the list goes on.\nWhere in mid he has nice squishy mages to kill who lack the sustained damage to kill someone as tanky as he is.\n\nI cant comment on his jungle because i have never seen him jungle, but while his ganking might be great, i cant see his clear time being any good at all especially early which is were it counts (which is half of jungling). in my opinion after the hype is over Sol jungle will cease to be a thing because he will be unable to compete with the proper junglers. \n\nAlso as a note: every single time without fail when a new champ comes out, people think they're always 'amazing janglers' but unless they are a specific jungler champ, after a month these 'amazing' jungle champs are almost never seen in the jung again... food for thought.","replies":[{"poster":"PubgamerAU","date":"2016-03-30T02:42:39.081+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The thing is, yas and zed thrive on being within his zone of control, and have easy ways of getting there.\n\nHere's a list of champions that inherently do well against aurelion:\n\nAkali\nAzir\nDiana\nEkko\nFiddlesticks\nFizz\nGalio\nJax\nKassadin\nKatarina\nLeblanc\nLee Sin\nLux\nMalzahar\nOlaf\nPantheon\nTalon\nTryndamere\nWukong\nXin Zhao\nYasuo\nZed\n\nWhat does that list look like to you? Assassins. Most top laners, while beefy, don't have reliable, 'right-in-your-face' gap closers. Some do have gap closers that I haven't mentioned, but those generally have a lower damage floor(like poppy for instance) and aren't as threatening. There are obviously also champions not on this list which you(or someone else) may have won against Aurelion with. I am not saying you can't beat Aurelion without a champion on this list. This is just a list of champions that, due to the nature of their abilities and base stats, have a large natural advantage over aurelion.\n\nThis list is mostly assassins because assassins thrive against traditional mage types. Traditional mage types still have 'burst' to fall back on. However, Aurelion is a sustained mage, not a burst mage(he has 2 burst skills and one of them is his ultimate). This makes him even weaker to assassins.\n\nTop lane generally aren't assassins. Sometimes they are/can be. But most of the time it's a fighter or a tank. Aurelion does GREAT against fighters and tanks, because they usually wont have the damage output to be a threat to aurelion after level 6. They are also much more susceptible to kiting than an assassin, who usually has at least one, if not more, reliable gap closers.\n\nGaren - His Q is generally stunned by Aurelion\nDarius - His E has shorter range than Aurelion W\nMundo - Would be a problem but his damage isn't high enough to be a significant threat\nElise - Extremely obvious and delayed gap closer that is easily stunned once she comes back down\nFiora - Unreliable gap closer. It's a free-range gap closer instead of a targeted one. A lot harder to land right\nJarvan - Predictable. Easily stunned after he's in melee for aurelion to move back into passive range. You counter his R with your R(knocks him out)\nRiven - Her gap closers are terrible for going against Aurelion. They don't even take her out of passive range\n\nAs for jungle, it's pretty obvious. Aurelion does have a slow jungle start due to the positioning requirement of his passive, but after level 3-5, he's clearing a lot faster, and ganking a lot more, than most other junglers. He also has far far better avenues for ganks than any other jungler in the game.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Lord Sesshomaru","date":"2016-03-28T08:27:46.889+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"1.
