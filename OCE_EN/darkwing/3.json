However we’ve heard a lot of feedback and reconsidered our decision. We now intend to rebuild the item set creator tool, but haven't yet started development work on it, so it could take quite some time even after we replace the legacy client. Of course, replacing the legacy client still comes first. In the meantime we still totally support item sets in-game (you don't lose your existing item sets when you update your client). \"\n- Riot","replies":[]},{"poster":"mosguinz","date":"2017-02-03T16:28:46.183+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yes and no.\n\n[Your _existing_ item sets will still work in-game.](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/230175788#h2q1) However the item set creator itself won't be available in the updated client.
