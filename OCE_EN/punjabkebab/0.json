It's possible for this to happen, if your MMR is lower than the MMR average of the players in your division, but for every game you win your MMR will increase, so the effect of it should decrease over time if you are consistently winning your games. In fact, after a while it should have the opposite effect, where you gain more LP for every victory and lose less LP for every loss.\n\nHow long has this been going for? Thirty games?","replies":[{"poster":"PUNJABKEBAB","date":"2015-10-19T09:19:58.239+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"this has been ongoing since i started playing ranked, and at least about 160 ranked games. still being deducted 20-25 points per loss, and never gaining more than 15 per win, win/loss is still positive, yet i still sit at 0 points in silver 5 because i would need to have double the amount of losses i have in wins to go anywhere. thanks riot.","replies":[]}]}]}
