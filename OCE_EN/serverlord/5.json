Pretty much 99.99% of my games are Arams. This is mainly due to my lifestyle, situation work schedule but mainly because I enjoy the Mode and game. I have probably over 4-5k Aram games under my belt. Though it is probably more. My problem and issue is 50% of my ARAM games I have encountered other players who non stop state 'I don't care, its ONLY an aram\" and this is happening when we should have won. They state \"Don't finish I want to blah blah\", My point is where is the line drawn where people join into an aram with the pure intention of trolling, feeding and then stating things on the lines of \"why are you so concerned or care about an aram game?\" This is the kind version. I just finished a game we should have won, and our NEW champ player refused to finish on the nexus after me as a tank, aced their team. This player refused to attack the nexus 3 times when we could have finished and we ended up with a loss. I reported the player, who non stop trash talked and insulted me at the end of game comment section. Riot need to specify and enforce the rules on other modes. These are LEGIT game modes and its really not fair on the players that join/play these other modes due to whatever reason and having to deal with players who 'Don't give a BEEP'...","replies":[{"poster":"DarkShade918","date":"2019-11-29T08:36:34.128+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"ARAM is a joke mode, people who take it seriously don't understand how to have fun, yes it's frustrating to see people ignoring the nexus in favour of BMing (i'm guilty of this) but equally as such who cares, its just an ARAM, its a coinflip mode there is nothing serious about it, a win or loss (generally) comes down to which team gets the better comp out of pure chance.\n\ni have nearly 3k ARAMs under my belt, i only play it because my Net is dogshit (thanks NBN), i'd rather lag in ARAM than in a Norms/Ranked, as ARAMs are meaningless anyways, they have no Ranked Mode (not that it should ever get one), if you don't like a players actions, report them, otherwise get over it, ARAM is a meme mode anyways, don't take it seriously","replies":[]},{"poster":"OhReflects","date":"2019-11-28T12:06:21.093+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"It still is just an aram bro you need to chill if you lose a game it's ok to accept that just keep reporting.

I guess you could end by yourself even if they v ping you by building ad on tank or pulling out of the last fights to get more damage off on the turrets and nexus?","replies":[]}]}
