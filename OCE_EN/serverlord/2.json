Our Nidalee&#039;s name was &quot;%%%%%&quot;. I reported them at the end (enemy OLAF non stop verbally abused/harrassed me for stating in all talk to report nid for a disgusting offensive racist name, but I guess unfortunately this is the attitude kids have these days).  (Nids name was N I > G G >A.) without the >. If we cant even type it in chat during gameplay or at the que/end screens. ITS CLEARLY NOT ACCEPTABLE in my opinion\n\n   Sadly, OCE are full of these kids who can&#039;t respect anything.  Tried to use the Submit a ticket thing and it just kept telling me to login, but wouldnt log me in. Lets clean this server up and start with the offensive, bad summoner names","replies":[{"poster":"SephirothSG","date":"2016-02-02T05:29:17.613+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey there,\n\nPlease remove the offending summoners name from your post as naming and shaming is NOT allowed on the boards and will only get your thread deleted by the moderators, did you report them at the end game screen?\n\nIf not you should [submit a ticket](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/requests/new) with any relevant information so that Riot can deal with the player.\n\nThanks","replies":[]}]}
