Did an aram, my team raged at me stating I was trolling, but my ping was going crazy. I usually sit at 32-33 ping constant. pulled the network cables out of the other 2 comps and turned the wireless off. It didn&#039;t help. Just wondering if there is ping issues or if anyone else with telstra paying a premium amount is having trouble with ping fluctuations. \r\n PS it has been fine for months even at this time of the evening when everyone is netflix&#039;in their butts off. I want to play a few more arams, but am scared I will be reported or something stupid by ghetto kids high on drugs or something. \r\nPPS Some kid with his 2 friends on curse voice tried to get his friends all to report me. He did worst than me with my 100-200+ fluctuating ping. Whats wrong with this community, I told him Ive won over 2k arams and lost about the same. 50/50. He just didn&#039;t get it","replies":[{"poster":"SephirothSG","date":"2017-02-11T09:54:34.717+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Could you do the following for me,\n\n* [Switch to a public DNS](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues#wq5)\n* [Download WinMTR](https://sourceforge.net/projects/winmtr/files/WinMTR-v092.zip/download) and run a traceroute to the following IP.
