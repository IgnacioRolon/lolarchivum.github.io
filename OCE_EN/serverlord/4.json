Can't click accept as it will not show the Accept.","subforum":"Help & Support (OCE)","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hi, Only recently as in the last 5 minutes after finishing my last game. I have been in que(s) for games. I was alt tabbed out at the first time. But it tabbed me back into the league client, stating someone had not accepted the game invite. So i clicked again to start searching finding a game and three times, it pauses the timer and then seems to freeze and I then get messages stating that someone declined. Now it states I am not accepted game invites and I am penalised with a 10 minute timer. Someone help please.","replies":[{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2019-12-23T10:13:06.601+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hmm, that's not one I've heard of before. It could be either connection or client-related which makes it tricky to nail down too.\n\nFirst thing I would recommend is to check your connection. Test other games, websites, try some customs and see if there is anything out of the ordinary.\n\nI would also recommend running a client repair (little gear icon in the top right of your client > initiate full repair).\n\nFailing all that, submit a ticket to player support and they can help you further: https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/requests/new","replies":[]}]}
