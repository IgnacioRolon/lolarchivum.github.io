Player Behavior Design Values: Reward","subforum":"Miscellaneous","up_votes":1,"down_votes":3,"body":"Rewards will not help the situation. Clearly Riot are aware of how Toxic this game has become and on the OCE server I believe it is a little too late. Our servers came up over a year ago, and we have had no access to the TRIBUNERAL, and therefore no 'threat' of action towards players that disrupt the community. \r\n  I use to play normals and dominons and rank on the NA server, but switching to the Oceanic server, we did not have access to dominons, so now I mainly played ARAMS. This was due to a game-mode environment, that one would have thought would be more fun and without the trolls / afkers / ragers... I was wrong. 80% of the Aram players are awesome decent people, but 19% of the rest think that \"afking in arams are OK, because its ONLY an aram\".... Most of these afkers have stated \"sorry I was cooking food, I was on facebook or other random life crisis events etc\"... Imagine if It was a worlds, LCS game.... OMFG be right back, the popcorn is burning!\".... \r\n     The point here is that the trolls have become comfortable, I report all afkers that afk for pathetic reasons like making food is more important or they forgot they had school in 10 minutes or state 'Sorry it's only an aram, afking is ok in aram'.. but the biggest and mostly used excuse is \"so what, who cares! there is no tribuneral.....\" \r\n\r\nThis is the attitude of these afkers/trolls/feeders etc. They don't care, they have gotten away with it since OCE came out. I have been reported so many times for stating that I am reporting them for afking... Then they and their duo friends report me... So what will a free cheap skin do for those players? Nothing. It's going to take alot more effort than a free reward to change this community. \r\n\r\n    Hope this helps, just my thoughts @Riot Team save the community in 1 day. \r\n\r\nP.S Bring on Dominions. Two non normal/rank gamemodes might give us all a breath of fresh air","replies":[{"poster":"Maraudaur","date":"2015-02-04T02:03:28.349+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey dude,\n\nJust because we don't have a tribunal doesn't mean we aren't punishing negative players.

None of the servers have tribunal atm, it is being remade\n2. If someone is raging, mute them\n3. ARAM is not at worlds, its only used as a casual / fun game mode.. your gribbling\n\nThe way i read all this is, your angry, prob have been baited into arguing with these trolls/rager etc.. on a number of occasions and tbh thats just as bad.\n\nIf someone is raging or whatever.. mute them its that simple, and at the end of the game report them. thats it. nothing more, move onto the next time, let riots manual bans work the toxic players out.. and yes they do actually check reports btw.\n\n\n\n\nYou need to take a step back, have a few days off and come back when your refreshed.\n\n\nGood luck mate\n\nAll the best\n","replies":[]}]}
