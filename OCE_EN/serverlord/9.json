Checked the Service status, but did not state anything. \r\n\r\n   I was in a game, just about to destroy their nexus, and low and behold, i got the trying to reconnect bar thing. I really hope I won this aram, but I can&#039;t login, and it says the game is unavailable at the launch screen. Please check into this Riot, we were loosing this aram but from my great advise (and being Skarner), we aced them twice after being hugged to our towers most of the game, and pushed on and me and 2 other allies were all set on destroying the nexus. Then it happened. Booted out or who knows, maintanance? or drop hacks i dont know, but please let me know!!! I don&#039;t want to be banned for afk/leaving the game even though i was there to the (end?) hopefully but if my allies died... We prob lost!!! \r\n\r\n    I have only dc&#039;d twice in the last year, from my dog pulling out the network cable, accidently and the power going out. Otherwise im there to the end!. Please dont ban me!","replies":[{"poster":"Zaps","date":"2015-09-15T22:21:46.771+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Looking at the time of your post - seems like this was at the time that the server was down for the 5.18 Patch - somewhere around 5:30AM AEST, right?\n\nNot sure why you didn't see this on the status page - http://status.leagueoflegends.com/#oce - it should have shown the details around the patch when you checked it. Are you sure that you had the Oceanic page loaded in particular?","replies":[]}]}
