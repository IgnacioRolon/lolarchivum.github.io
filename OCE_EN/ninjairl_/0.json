Which isn't that different to sivir or nocturne spell shields.

Nor did I ever mean to say that Fiora is OP.\nThe video narrator may have used it but I only use the video to show people the extent to what Fiora can do.\n\nI am simply saying that it should be looked at by Riot. It's quite a strong ability if it can block ultimates the likes of Bard, Zed, Sejuani, Malzahar, Darius, Mordekaiser, etc.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Mar3thyu","date":"2015-08-20T14:46:02.745+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yes it is balanced as she has a 0.75 second window to use it. I see it being a problem in the higher elos Diamond-Challenger as they are gonna be able to time it perfectly but saying that their opponents would be aware and try and bait it out","replies":[]}]}
