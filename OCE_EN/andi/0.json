Some friends and I were goofing around one night and made this... semi-legit looking formula that could actually work.\n\nThe formula is       100 - 20x + 5a = (Chance of winning a game in a percentage)\nA = to the amount of people in your premade (excluding yourself)\nX = Amount of strangers in your team \nNote : This doesnt work if youre playing solo\nFor Example if you and a friend decided to play a game, it would mean\nA = 1\nX = 3                         \nThen we apply those numbers to the formula \n 100 - 20(3) + 5(1) = 45% (chance of winning)\n\nBut in the situation where A &ge; X, the answer to the formula must be divided by 2\n\nFor example, you&#039;re in a full premade team.\n100 - 20(0) + 5(4) = 120\n120/2 = 60%\n\nBut say if you wanted to take a step further.\nthen you apply an Elo Formula to your answer\nThe Elo formula is (100 - 20x + 5a) X (Your Team Elo Number &divide; Enemy Team Elo Number)\n\nTo find the Elo Number\n**Bronze = 5\nSilver/Unranked = 10\nGold = 15\nPlat = 20\nDiamond and above = 25**\nto get an Elo Number for each team you add the ranks of each member of a team together. to continue the formula you get your team number then divide it by the enemy&#039;s team number.\nE.g \n10 + 15 + 15 + 5 + 20 = Your Team Elo Number\n15 + 10 + 20 + 20 + 15 = Enemy Elo Number\nin this case 65 &divide; 80 = 0.8125 (\n60 (Winning Chance Formula Answer) X 0.8125 (Elo Number Formula)\n= 48.75% chance of winning\n\nBasically, all you have to remember is\nChance of winning Formula = 100 - 20x + 5a\nElo Number Formula = (results of the winning formula) X (Your Team / Enemy Team Number)\n\nMy friends and I have wasted a good 2 hours on this..... we could have played 2 games of league\n\n&quot;When the hell would we actually use this&quot;\n&quot;We won&#039;t&quot;\n\"IN THE LOADING SCREEN\" - the very special child","replies":[{"poster":"Tele","date":"2016-12-17T08:06:58.577+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Pretty good post ;) Have you tested it out on any games yet?\n\nAlso could I recommend using MMR estimates instead of rank for your _\"elo number\"_? Rank can be really misleading in some cases, but MMR estimates will generally be more reliable. You can get some great MMR estimates [here](http://www.lol-mmr.com/) or on [op.gg](http://oce.op.gg/).","replies":[{"poster":"Andi","date":"2016-12-18T09:12:24.496+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yea, that would be a better idea. just replacing the Elo number with the mmr from op.gg could still work.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"ninja150z","date":"2016-12-18T09:06:46.505+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"If only someone developed a system which accounted for the subdivisions, games with champion and the champion factor.\n  \nFor example, one player might be B1 the other player B3, the B1 is a Yasuo main the B3 is a quasi-mediocre Riven main. \nIn this instance the B1 would be superior on two counts, but the Riven would still have the possibility of winning because of the c factor. \n\nIn this system they could also introduce win rates, but the more games played the less the win rate would be considered. \nFor example, 1-20 games would have very high consideration, 20-40 medium consideration, 40-60 quasi-low consideration and 60-80 low consideration.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Nightjar","date":"2016-12-18T06:59:11.698+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"At first i was like, this isn't going to work, but then as I read more and more I was like actually wow this is actually amazing.","replies":[]},{"poster":"NIghtshadowb","date":"2016-12-18T06:25:53.424+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Ayy That's pretty good","replies":[]}]}
