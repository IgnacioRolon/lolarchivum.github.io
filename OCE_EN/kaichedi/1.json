Sure submit a report or a support ticket, but making a thread for it on the boards is alot of effort and you should already know that moderators don't like 'name and shame', also he could just be playing badly or maybe the meta has shifted to punish teemo more (I didn't even know people played teemo above bronze). Maybe his internet has gone bad or maybe he doesn't have as much time to play. So many things it could be and it's not really your business, so why stress out about it?","replies":[{"poster":"Anıma","date":"2016-12-17T06:44:31.516+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Mhmm, if he's that bad just contact Riot lol. \nI don't see the effort in naming and shaming on boards after 1-2 games.
