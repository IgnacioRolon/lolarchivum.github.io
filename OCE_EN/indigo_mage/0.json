Is it just me or was Draft URF so much more fun than  ARURF cos you could choose who to play (as long as they weren&#039;t banned or permabanned in the game mode) which meant you could do silly comps and builds that wouldn&#039;t work outside the game mode. It just feels they&#039;ve taken away a factor that brought extra fun to the game where as now ARURF seems to become stale after a few matches. Also on the topic of game modes, will we ever see one for all ever again? Personally this was my favourite game mode seeing how other champs interact with themselves and some of my favourite memories of this game are from One For All. I dearly miss my favourite game modes and just want to know if they will ever come back and if not why.","replies":[{"poster":"QAPLA","date":"2017-12-21T08:03:49.774+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I remember when 'One For All' was basically a hack for custom games, you'd have 10 Teemo's and the game would never end.","replies":[]},{"poster":"cookiemuncher","date":"2017-12-21T05:55:41.565+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Ofcourse draft URF was more fun.

It was basically a crazy April Fool’s gag that ended up becoming hugely popular. Given how popular it is, lots of players want to know why we don’t bring back regular URF more often. There’s one reason that we haven’t really talked about before now: \nURF makes some people stop playing League. \nEvery time we ran regular URF, we’d see a huge spike of games being played, and then the numbers actually dropped back down to a level that’s lower than it was just before we ran URF. \nIt’s normal for new players to join League and for some longtime players to leave—this happens all the time. But when we turned on regular URF, it was different. In NA, for example, whenever we ran URF we’d usually see over twice as many longtime players leave the game compared to what we would’ve normally expected. \nIn other words, some people binged on URF, and then suddenly stopped playing League. And the size of the dropoff indicates that it’s not just people coming back for URF and then leaving afterwards. Despite spending a lot of time investigating the reasons, we aren’t actually sure whether URF causes some sort of “hangover” effect or if it makes regular games feel slow by comparison—maybe it’s because URF feels like playing League with cheats turned on. Regardless, after we turn on URF, total games played go down, as do overall game hours. And they don’t recover for a long time, if ever. \nWe’ve been trying to wrap our heads around a way to solve this problem for a while, and that’s one of the biggest reasons you see us experimenting with variations on the mode like ARURF and Snow Battle ARURF. Although these modes still suffer a bit from the “binge-then-churn” effect that regular URF has, it’s not nearly as bad (probably because you’re not seeing the same OP champs every game). \nURF causes some people to stop playing League, but a lot of you really love it. So instead of killing URF altogether, we’re just gonna keep experimenting to find some healthier version of the mode. Tell us your thoughts about Snow Battle ARURF—we’ll listen and apply what we learn to ARURF’s next appearance. \nGHOSTCRAWLER & RIOT CACTOPUS“","replies":[]}]}]}
