We recently defeated Dire Wolves 3-1 in the Semi-Final and we are excited to continue our wins to get ourselves tickets to Turkey!\r\n\r\nThis game at Luna Park has a lot of assumptions and history, but we see this as an opportunity to establish OCE on the world stage, as the best teams sharpen each other, to help them bring their best against the rest of the world.\r\n\r\nLegacy eSports is:\r\n\r\nTop: An &#039;Minkywhale&#039; Trinh - @MinkywhaleLoL\r\nJungle: Tim &#039;Carbon&#039; Wendel - @OCECarbon\r\nMid: Aaron &#039;ChuChuZ&#039; Bland - @ChuChuZs\r\nAD Carry: James &#039;WallyThacka&#039; Shute - @Tallywhacka\r\nSupport: Curtis &#039;flyingJoo&#039; Schembri - @flyingjooo\r\n\r\nSubs:\r\nBrandon &#039;Claire&#039; Nguyen\r\nElliot &#039;Impaired&#039; Capell\r\nZachary &#039;Pacman&#039; Bayne\r\n\r\nCoach: Aaron &#039;Gallex&#039; Asher / Nathan &#039;Maxxy&#039; Maxwell\r\n\r\nWe will be around to answer questions for most of the evening, so keep &#039;em coming!","replies":[{"poster":"Swiffer","date":"2015-08-05T09:09:13.292+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"@minkywhale thoughts on TAHM KUNCH? ;)","replies":[{"poster":"minkywhale","date":"2015-08-05T09:26:28.773+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Tahm is super strong in lane phase but falls off in the mid-late game.

Frustration? Disappointment? Over confidence?\n\nHow much of the game is mental at the OPL level?","replies":[{"poster":"dog dad","date":"2015-08-05T08:49:29.928+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey, I'm the Mid laner of Legacy and that's a fantastic question for my jungler haha. Mental fitness is paramount in nearly every sport and especially within League of Legends. It's only been a year and a bit since Oceanic eSports has really grown so teams are constantly facing new internal issues which really shapes a team's perseverance and longevity. About 2 years ago players were constantly jumping around and no one really stayed together after a month leaving 1 or 2 excelling teams. Anyway today's OPL standard mentality within players has really improved and its something that every new player should focus on aside of their game knowledge and in game mechanical skill. Not to say that we don't get frustrated or disappointed from a tough loss in solo queue but some of us do have hobbies specifically for this issue. Such as going to the gym, running, getting a casual job and simply socialising to friends outside of the game. \n\nHope my answer was informative,\n- ChuChuZ","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Tirades","date":"2015-08-05T08:47:30.911+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Where do you see Legacy as an organisation leading?
