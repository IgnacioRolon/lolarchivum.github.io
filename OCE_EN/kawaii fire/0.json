Mechanically, I&#039;m challenged as a player and am oft overconfident in my abilities. However, my game knowledge and attitude towards the game as well as the use of less challenging champs has helped me immensely in my battle with bronze solo queue. My question here is, how do i improve my hidden mmr? Or is that even something i should look into considering i make most of my plays by punishing other&#039;s lack of game knowledge...etc. Naturally i just want to be a better player. and, i&#039;m trying my hardest, I&#039;ve just hit a hard curve. Any tips? Any help at all is appreciated thanks ^^","replies":[{"poster":"Yasei Doubutsu","date":"2016-07-12T03:45:35.572+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I can try and help, I'm a free coach.

I have been up for promotion 4 times now, and every time  I have landed a troll a person who plays a carry as a support. and between this and the fact its a  5 v 5  game and one element  of these being off cost you the game  its actually very hard to  get out of bronze with out a good run.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"greatdeathz","date":"2016-07-12T10:35:39.923+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"im also bronze and i learn more and grow as a player when i play normal games not bronze, i believe you should take a break from bronze sometimes and play normal because bronze players tend to get stuck in a certain pattern and there is hardly any growth in that division","replies":[]},{"poster":"TheOneUser","date":"2016-07-12T04:04:47.930+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Winstreaks should push up your mmr (and of course, playing a lot).\nAlso (I'm not sure about this) not playing ranked for 2 seasons resets your promos\n\nlower lp wins and higher losses generally mean that you're playing against players worse (lower mmr) than you.\nThis can be fixed by playing with those with a higher mmr than you (just playing with others already gets you harder matchups)","replies":[]},{"poster":"Sneed","date":"2016-07-12T03:56:22.066+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"stop playing ranked\nif you cant do that then play champions who rely on the basics of league\ne.g nasus: helps you learn lane control/how to farm/how to have an efficient laning phase\nor someone with an easy kit like malphite or maokai who are always useful, even when behind","replies":[]},{"poster":"bgentle2myashe","date":"2016-07-12T03:45:56.098+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'm not an expert on the subject by any means but, as far as I'm aware the best way you can improve you're mmr is by playing 5 man ranked. I might be wrong so don't quote me but I think Riot give additional mmr or a better percentage mmr ratio for winning 5 man ranked particularly against higher elo players. Obviously it takes more skill and practice for a pre made to beat another pre made so I think they compensate for that with bonus mmr.","replies":[]}]}
