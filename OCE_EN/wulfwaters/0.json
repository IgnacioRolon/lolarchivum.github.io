I&#039;m training up to play ranked with a mate. I&#039;m aim to play as much top as possible and am looking for some quality top laners to spectate. I main Volibear, Rammus, Renekton, and the (very) occasional Quinn. \r\n\r\nDo you guys know of anyone worth watching play?\r\n\r\nCheers,\r\n\r\nWulfWaters","replies":[{"poster":"drag66n","date":"2016-01-01T03:40:09.371+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"main quinn and look for 4 tank team meta.","replies":[]},{"poster":"JasonWazza","date":"2015-12-31T10:49:45.034+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The thing with spectating top laners is they tend to either be really diverse, or really focused, so it would be hard to actually give you ones for what you've asked for.\n\nNot to mention, Renekton is the main meta champ that you listed, Rammus top is very rarely seen, and voli tends to be in jungle when he is played.","replies":[]}]}
