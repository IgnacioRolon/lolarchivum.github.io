Yet I am one example of a OCE player that continues to play on NA as do half a dozen of my real life friends. This is because 3v3 is not enabled on this server and for the most part is the only game mode we play. I am 1 person and that's 7 people still playing on NA then how many others are still doing the same thing because the server lacks the queue of choice twisted treeline. And before people pipe up and say it is enabled 3 nights a week, we like to play 3's competitively so normal queue simply isn't enough. The point is without a dedicated player base and with a large portion being on another sever, the game mode will never see the light of day.","replies":[{"poster":"valistus","date":"2015-08-09T16:07:21.772+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"well said, i also play on us server most of the time, and dont forget all the people who already left because they wont put up with the ping.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Ngau","date":"2014-12-06T07:07:16.006+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":0,"body":"The reason my i left my main in NA (apart from my friends) is for ranked TT.\nI understand that the queue for 3v3 matches is much longer in comparison to SR, but if some people enjoy playing on that map, they'll put in the time and effort to queue for it regardless of the time :)","replies":[]},{"poster":"jowlface","date":"2014-11-26T00:26:02.846+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Ranked was available for a short time last night on Twisted Treeline, was this intentional?","replies":[{"poster":"Sephyre3","date":"2014-11-26T00:57:09.614+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"> Ranked was available for a short time last night on Twisted Treeline, was this intentional?\n\nAs MasterMirkinen pointed out in another thread it was not intentional.

Why can't we have a Dominion queue? I understand the Oceanic numbers are small, but I can't see why it's such a problem to have it available, if not on a day of the week where numbers spike up.\n\nIf I knew that the queue wouldn't be available even after 2 years I probably would've stayed on the NA server just for dominion. I love the mode, and it was fantastic to play when you needed something different and fast paced. ARAM seriously doesn't do that, and there's so many times you can end up in a game of that with a champion you didn't want to play, or one of the teams is so over powered it's just boring. On top of that's it's still the same in terms of objective and gameplay, destroy Turrets > Inhib > Nexus. Dominion offered a mix up from that and a complete difference in strategy. From my experience there are a lot of new players on the Oceanic Server that didn't transfer from NA and have no clue what the Crystal Scar map is even about. I can't even play a custom hoping for a group to verse because everyone seems to think it's for the 'Hide and Seek' game mode and not an actual map. So I think it would be nice to at least do a trial run, like with the 3v3 map.\n\nI understand it's a difficult thing to implement but I hope it's not off the table. Even if it were available a single day each week, even fortnight I'd be happy. I just want to play my favourite mode again. :(","replies":[{"poster":"Hynnil","date":"2015-08-20T04:18:28.670+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I've still got accounts on NA.
