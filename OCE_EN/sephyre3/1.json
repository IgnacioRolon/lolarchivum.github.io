Unfortunately we have seen the number of players in the Team Builder queue decline over time so we will be disabling the queue on Friday 9 October at 2:30 AM AEDT.\r\n\r\nThe development team are working on an improved Champion Select experience, so we may look to introduce that in the future. We&#039;ll post any updates on the boards when there is more info to share.\r\n\r\nIt&rsquo;s also important to point out that this doesn&#039;t mean that another queue will take its place. All of the queues are evaluated independently and are currently in a healthy place, but they haven&rsquo;t grown to the point of expansion yet.\r\n\r\nYou can see the full queue schedule in the stickied post: http://boards.oce.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/miscellaneous/ZzQR1haM-queue-schedule","replies":[{"poster":"Tyron","date":"2015-10-07T05:25:52.019+0000","up_votes":15,"down_votes":0,"body":"I wish you would replace it with Normal Draft {{champion:32}}","replies":[{"poster":"fattyhotdogs","date":"2015-10-07T05:59:29.223+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":4,"body":"Go get more people playing the game then.

Riot removed Normal Draft thinking that those players would switch to that PoS TeamBuilder. The queue time for Normal Draft was already healthy, and players were content with the fact that the time in queue was a worthwhile trade-off for the sake of having a better quality match.","replies":[{"poster":"Humaj","date":"2015-12-05T08:13:37.262+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The only drawback to TeamBuilder is that it splits the queues, and tends to create longer queue times for carries no matter the health of the queue. NA TeamBuilder is about as healthy as JasonWazza claims OCE normal draft was, and worked so well that it was my primary queue. It was a valid if unfortunate choice to remove it when they implemented TeamBuilder, but I agree that it's probably reasonable to bring it back now that they've disabled TeamBuilder.\n\nTangentially, I loved that TeamBuilder motivated people to queue as support and jungle. It encouraged carry mains to diversify, and to consider not maining mid or ADC, which (if effective) would improve matchmaking experience across queues when people return to normal draft or blind pick. I don't know if it is/was as strong a motivation as I would like, but at the very least, it meant I could quickly find matches as support or jungle without having to deal with multiple people instalocking the same role, or arguing until it's too late, causing people to take their top setup into the jungle or whatever. Yes, they're morons and such self-inflicted suffering is appropriate, except that the entire team suffers, and it potentially ruins the game for all ten players.","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Zorphiax","date":"2015-10-10T04:00:55.783+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Well make aram like TT(Twisted Treeline) or replace it with crystal scar for a trial and remove Team Builder (Which it has been) and we will be able to have normal draft pick.","replies":[{"poster":"fattyhotdogs","date":"2015-10-10T06:22:10.604+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"ARAM is huge.

TB has had tons of encouragement, summoner icons, bonuses, better times than any other introduced queue. The reality is people like blind pick, no matter how much Riot throws incentives in the way of Teambuilder, which they definitely have. Now imagine if they did that for draft.

Its implementation alongside its main competitor without disabling one or the other, even for a trial, was a poor decision.  \n\nChampion select can be highly volatile and you're just as likely to get a team that communicates as you are to encounter a fight. This behavior is enabled by the fact that no one wants to spend at least 20 minutes (potentially a full game with a duo) with the guy intentionally feeding just to send a report off in the post game.","replies":[]}]}
