Was hoping this gets sorted out before Christmas. Please help us, these are the replies I am still getting until today after purchasing Dragon Trainer Tristana around 12:20am on the 23rd December.\n\n\nHi there Krawia,\n\nIt is good to know that we have your support for our Snowdown 2015 event. While we appreciate your effort in grabbing the Dragon Trainer Tristana skin, I regret to say that only legendary skins that are bought within the Legendary Snowball event are eligible for the reward. As I have checked and as mentioned by orochikyo, your transaction was completed prior to the event period. I'm sorry, but you have not earned a Mystery Skin for this purchase and regrettably, I am unable to manually grant you this reward.\n\nI know that I have provided you with an answer that you were not hoping for, but I hope that you will still continue to contact us if you need anything else. We'd be more than willing to assist you the best way we can within our capabilities.\n\nRegards,\n\nKunoichi\nRiot Player Support\nMaven of the Strings\n\nPlease help this is getting tiring and frustrating and I regret ever purchasing the skin because of all this these problems due to you making a mistake in the announcement and Riot support refusing to help me after spending hours trying to explain to them the situation. I thought Riot OCE has already told them about the mistake but they still refuse to help. If this isn't working I'll be considering a complaint about false advertising to the ACCC.\n\n-Krawia","replies":[{"poster":"Gehirn","date":"2015-12-25T03:30:38.313+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hi Krawia,\n\nI've looked into your account and it appears you purchased Dragon Trainer Tristana on the 22nd at 4PM AEDT. The issue outline above is regarding any purchases happening on the **23rd** before 7PM because it wasn't clearly stated that the Legendary Snowball promotion started at that time. It was, however, mentioned that Legendary Snowball started on the 23rd, not the 22nd.","replies":[{"poster":"Vier","date":"2015-12-25T03:33:11.883+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"4PM?
