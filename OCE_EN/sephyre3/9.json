We&#039;ve never made it to worlds before and I feel like this is our best chance yet.\r\n\r\nSomething that comes up every time we do interviews for video content with the teams is how much the support means. The boys are reading the hashtag #IAMOCE as well as posts on their Facebook page (https://www.facebook.com/chiefsesc ).\r\n\r\nSo it would be cool if we posted some messages/pictures of support for them. They&#039;re over in Turkey practicing right now and Riot Ferlyn is going to make sure they see this thread.\r\n\r\nThe support from you all can make a real difference.\r\n\r\nHere&#039;s our attempt - i&#039;m sure you guys can do better :P\r\n\r\nhttp://i.imgur.com/edVKtyq.jpg","replies":[{"poster":"Fasffy","date":"2015-08-25T03:37:47.032+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":0,"body":"I can't get over your sign Atlus AHAHHAHAHAHAH","replies":[]},{"poster":"LemonHunter","date":"2015-08-25T04:13:20.446+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"Was spectacular to watch The Chiefs take out the OPL Grand Final and it's going to be great to watch The Chiefs take out the IWCQ Grand Final!\n\nWe know you can do it boys, you got this.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Maraudaur","date":"2015-08-25T04:08:00.672+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Also remember you can find all the details for IWC here - http://oce.lolesports.com/content/iwcq-2015\n\nGames are streamed on www.twitch.tv/riotgames2 and start at 7pm AEST on the 26th of August.
