(I assume he uses chemicals to summon them and various herbs and relics but I am still not sure as he has not said).\n\n(I also assume the creation of items is just as magical - requiring epic journeys and summoning rituals; please don't disillusion me as to how Riot works). I just wish he would drop a line on OCE - the OCE Riot team seem cool (Drop bear pantheon just saying that's a good Australian icon - dunno how it fits into the other countries on OCE's server but oh well it was worth saying) - league has grown a lot. Can you tell us anything about the future of league and its content, do you see Champion production slowing down or massive changes to the meta coming?\n\nI <3 fantasy books - reading one atm called the blood of eden series about a vampire girl, I love the writing too - very emotionally descriptive and to the point - and a little dark too. Congratulations on the Job at Riot. It's a great game and has a good professional community (the non-professional community have their moments). I miss NA's larger pool of players and some of the style of a lot of NA players, also the sweeping trends and mini-meta's but OCE has meta's of it's own - however it's still a sapling in comparison and I see it as developing more in uniquity and trends and ideas, I also see the OCE pro teams are doing very will in my opinion and hope OCE develops as strong a community as the NA server and hope to see them take the Championship this year or in years to come (Victorious drop bear pantheon noW) - but having played with a few high-rated NA players think they have their work cut out for them.\n\nAre you enjoying your time with Riot - or is it hard work and does a lot of thinking and planning go into your job or the work around you, or is it really cruisy and made easier by a good chain of command and dereliction of duties, expectations and plans and ideas?","replies":[{"poster":"Sephyre3","date":"2015-07-06T00:53:13.950+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I can't really comment about the future development stuff, I don't work on the development team.\n\nRe working here - loving every minute of it!
