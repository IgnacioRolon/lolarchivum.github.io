The settings are conservative right now and will be ramped up aggressively over time.\n\n\n\n***Reporting***\n\n**What happens when you report someone?**\n\nWhen a player is reported, the full report is recorded and stored for analysis by our behavior systems, including information about the reporter and the game.\n\nReports are used by the Instant Feedback System in the following way:\n\n* Teammates or opponents of the offending player send reports and the system validates them to make sure they aren’t false\n* The system examines the case and determines whether the behaviour deserves rejection or punishment based on community-driven standards of behaviour\n* The system fires a reform card through email, sharing the chat log of the offending player (we scrub other players’ names and chat logs) and the punishment for the behaviour\n* Follow-up notifications for players who reported a player who was punished\n\nYou can read more about it in Lyte’s post: http://oce.leagueoflegends.com/en/news/game-updates/player-behavior/new-player-reform-system-heads-testing\n\n**Does Riot read every report?**\n\nEvery report is analysed by our system. Reports and corresponding game chat logs are reviewed by our Player Support team when we are considering severe punishments such as permanent bans. We also regularly use comments from reports and logs to ensure the accuracy of our systems.\n\n**What about false reports?**\n\nWhen analysing reports, our systems look for behaviour patterns. Only consistent reports from reliable players will be enough to trigger a punishment. Players who attempt to abuse the system with false reports are flagged and their reports are ignored.\n\n**What player behaviour systems are enabled on the server right now?**\n\nCurrently we have the Instant Feedback System, the Chat Restriction System as well as Intentional Feeder Detection and the LeaverBuster system. We also conduct ban waves when repeat offenders that are not showing signs of reform have their accounts permanently suspended.\n\n***Chat Restriction System***\n\n**What is a chat restriction?**\n\nChat Restrictions are an upgrade to standard bans we designed with the goal of improving and reforming the behavior of players who create negative experiences in League.\n\n**What does a chat restriction do?**\n\nA chat restriction applies a temporary chat limitation to your account for a set number of games. This means players who are chat restricted will only be able to interact with their teams through gameplay, pings, and very limited messaging opportunities.\n\n**How does the system work?**\n\nChat restrictions take multiple reports over a series of games into account. Players with normal behaviour will never be affected, and there are a number of protections in place that sort out false reports, premade abuse, and other potential issues.\n\nIf a player is continuously displaying negative behaviour they will then receive chat restrictions on that account.  \n\nYou can find more information about Chat Restrictions in the knowledge base article: https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752984-Restricted-Chat-Mode \n\n**What is happening with Tribunal?**\n\nThe Player Behaviour team is launching features of the new Tribunal as they finish, with the first one being Reform Cards. This is now live as part of Instant Feedback.\n\nYou can see some of the upcoming features the team is working on in Lyte's post - http://oce.leagueoflegends.com/en/news/game-updates/player-behavior/new-player-reform-system-heads-testing\n\n***Intentional Feeder Detection***\n\n**What about intentional feeders? **\n\nThere is a separate system that focuses purely on feeders. If someone is feeding intentionally in multiple games then they will face temporary account suspensions and possible bans if they show no signs of reform.\n\n***LeaverBuster***\n\n**I keep getting leavers in my game. What happens to them?**\n\nThe **first time** a player leaves a game, they’ll see a pop-up explaining that leaving is not okay and then have to manually agree to not leave future games. **If they continue to repeatedly ruin other players’ experiences,** they’ll enter lower-priority matchmaking for a number of games. While in low priority queue, players will experience queue times that are 5, 10, even 20 minutes longer than a player who hasn't left games.\n\nPlayers will know how many games they have in lower-priority, and if they join a premade group, that group will be notified they are playing with a chronic AFK/leaver and they’ll face the same lower-priority time penalty.\n\nWhile we hope it doesn’t ever happen, if a player fails to stop AFKing or leaving while in lower-priority matchmaking, continued offenses will result in bans.\n\nYou can read more about LeaverBuster in Lyte’s post: http://oce.leagueoflegends.com/en/news/game-updates/player-behavior/updates-leaverbuster \n\n**What if I want to know more about the vision for Player Behaviour?**\n\nExploring Player Behaviour design values: http://oce.leagueoflegends.com/en/news/game-updates/player-behavior/exploring-player-behavior-design-values \n\nPlayer Behaviour design values: Reform: http://oce.leagueoflegends.com/en/news/game-updates/player-behavior/player-behavior-design-values-reform \n\nPlayer Behaviour design values: Reward: http://oce.leagueoflegends.com/en/news/game-updates/player-behavior/player-behavior-design-values-reward\n\nPlayer Behaviour design values: Punishment: http://oce.leagueoflegends.com/en/news/game-updates/player-behavior/player-behavior-design-values-punishment","replies":[{"poster":"Godkoz","date":"2015-03-17T08:22:40.190+0000","up_votes":50,"down_votes":2,"body":"To be honest all I want is the ability to say I don't want to play with this specific person ever again.

He had a chat restriction on the NA servers so that system at least works over there.\n\nAlso when in ranked and someone does afk, rage, or feed (eg. walk down lane into tower etc) at the end everyone leaves immediately and doesn't report them because the player base at large thinks it's a waste of time because they never get punished. \n\nRiot please ACTUALLY DO SOMETHING ABOUT THIS!

And with enough reports, thy can get a higher punishment, rather than just the \"Warning notice\" right off the bat.\n\nSo reports increase the severity of any player who leaves a game, I assume because they're more likely to have been raging before hand. But if there is no recorded loss of connection with the player then if is assumed more likely that they were toxic before hand and choose to leave the game because they were upset. But if the player was not reported the severity of punishments increases much slower because the system sees it as more likely to be an innocent power outage.\nBecause of that little tit-bit I make sure to only report players for leaving if there is a clear sign that they left due to toxicity.

Long waits for little action is encouraging these trolls and its a free game so often they will brag they have 3+ lvl 30 accounts and so just keep changing. When you enter a lobby and someone starts trolling from the get go there needs to be an option for the other 4 people to terminate that lobby and report that person, if someone cant find a lobby because nobody wants to play with them then that should make bans easier too. If someone gets a handful of reports, ban them from ranked for the rest of the day, if they continue make it 3 then a month then perma. Game after game there are trolls and often they manage to twist the game so hard after feeding that the enemy actually report you instead of the feeder. \nThe other day I had a Kog troll from lobby stating he as gonna feed this game regardless. So he goes and gives FB to my mid lane opponent by walking straight up mid, and again, and again, finishes the game 2-29. The jungler was his duo so I got zero help against a fed opponent, and at then end both duo and one other are reporting me as apparently going slightly negative vs a lane opponent fed by a troll is a reportable offense, and the guy who got fed by a troll is agreeing with them and egging them on and says he is reporting me too.  So once he feeds my lane opponent im screwed. He is fed so its going to be really really hard to beat him no matter, I get no help from jungler, he roams and kills everything, so my lane is gone and there is nothing I can do, if i try to fight and die they say Im feeding, and if I dont fight then im afk. Either way my KDA and MMR and win rate and LP are all screwed. And OFC the trolls wont FF so thats 45 mins of them feeding and trolling and generally making the game as little fun as possible, and no matter what I do im screwed. \nIf this guy clearly states in lobby he will troll and 4 people click \"I wanna get out of this madhouse\" or 3 if they are a duo, then why make us suffer through 20 to 50 minutes of BS and lose MMR and LP because of an intentional troll? Right now we have the option of dodging and taking 3 points, not too bad, unless its promos and telling enemy that just makes it more likely they will troll. Fix the trolls and tighten ranked restrictions. Honestly if these trolls are having a bad day and make the stupid decision to play ranked and get reported in a couple of consecutive games then just stop the ranked queue for them. Let them play arams and normals. Dont let them destroy the ranked part of the game for everyone. \n\nTLDR - Ban people from just ranked queue for a short time very fast, let them play norms but no ranked for a day or 2 once they accumulate reports. And give an option to dissolve a lobby with an obvious troll so we are not forced to play a troll game.","replies":[{"poster":"Nezu","date":"2016-01-13T14:57:13.836+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Back to your first point, I honestly feel like you're really onto something there. I myself don't really have trolls anymore due to rank, but back when I was in a lower Elo I always wished there was a way to leave the lobby without a suffer in LP or a wait time. If there was an option to \"Terminate Lobby\" (Like a surrender vote), which had a majority rule system, again like a surrender vote, I feel like this would be extremely beneficial to those in lower Elo's who are too scared to dodge because they're going to lose LP. Also, the block player point, another comment above mentioned blocking a player removed the ability to que with them. I feel like if both the terminate lobby and player blocking system were combined, there would be a HUGE decrease in the levels of toxicity in the game. Granted, to terminate the lobby, it should be a 4/1 majority rule so someone can't terminate the lobby cause they're last pick/didn't get their role, but I honestly feel like you're onto something here. If a Rioter or someone could respond to let us know they've seen this, that'd be great.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Jason","date":"2015-03-17T03:25:51.376+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"Is there a player behavior specialist team representing within OCE?\n\nAre the reports sent internationally to be dealt with, or do the community team just have a go at it whenever they're not busy?\n\nRegardless, looking forward to this \"new and improved\" tribunal.","replies":[{"poster":"Sephyre3","date":"2015-03-17T03:40:08.730+0000","up_votes":7,"down_votes":3,"body":"We have all of the systems listed above (Chat Restrictions, Feeder Detection, LeaverBuster).\n\nRiot Gehirn heads up player support here and is the one who takes point on case reviews for severe punishments such as permanent bans, etc. The community team focuses on community projects.\n\nWe have also just opened up a new role for a player behaviour specialist - listed here: http://www.riotgames.com/careers/54259","replies":[{"poster":"DarkTetris","date":"2015-03-18T10:50:27.693+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":1,"body":"Reinstate the tribunal and you can have the player base do it for free.
