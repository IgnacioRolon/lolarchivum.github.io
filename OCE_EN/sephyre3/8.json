I mean, talk about mixed messages!\n\nSometimes, it really feels like League cares about me - he let's me know when sales are coming up, he always invites me to the coolest eSpots matches, there was even this one time when he built an artificial reef with my name on it! Swoon!\n\nBut then he pulls stuff like this and it feels neglectful, you know? Like maybe he has more important things than me going on? \n\nPlease help! Am I being too sensitive?
