Maybe shifting the times around for how long they are available for a trial week or fortnight would see some improvements in player numbers. I for one love twisted treeline.

Maybe remove the bans or reduce the number of bans so that players do not need to own 16 champions. I don't play ranked too much and hate the role call system that we have. Removing bans would help people from being blocked out, and also maybe shifting things around so that some of the time there is normal draft and the rest of the time there is normal blind picks. This would not (hopefully would not) put too much pressure on the servers.
