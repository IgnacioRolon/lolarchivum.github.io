It doesn't really seem fair and it kinda defeats the purpose of 'Mystery Champion'.\n\nEDIT: I think you don't get a mystery champion if you have almost all the champions bought (like maybe 1-5 champions remaining) you'll just get a mystery skin, unfortunately. Like I mentioned, it defeats the purpose of the reward if you know you're just gonna get Jhin or some other guaranteed champion you don't own.","replies":[{"poster":"DynastyZX","date":"2016-02-04T11:09:42.102+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"thats the point though you dont own them i have around 7 left and got given a ruthless pantheon skin -__- yay...","replies":[{"poster":"TSM Bengi","date":"2016-02-04T18:31:12.989+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"if you have less than 10 champions remaining you will receive a skin. they've said it before","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Blackiecat12","date":"2016-02-02T08:15:20.443+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"By the way Sephyre... how long do you spend on the forums (sorry unrelated to the topic), i am really interested!","replies":[{"poster":"Sephyre3","date":"2016-02-02T08:42:20.482+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"As much time as I can :)\n\nHard to really put a number of hours to it, but i check in fairly often.\n\nLike, i'll usually have a tab open at work, often at home, and i'll habitually skim on my phone on the train, but still not enough to keep up with every thread, nowhere near it.
