(Not affecting anything, but arguably equally as annoying)\nBy that, I mean the friend list not refreshing, the names in the chat windows remaining minimized when there is enough space, and some others. \nHere is a list of all the bugs I found, if you want: https://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/4ikoo3/found_about_20_bugs_on_the_client/\nSome are more minor than the others, I think the most annoying ones are the #1, 2, 4, 6, 9, 11, 13, 17, 18, 20, 32 and 33. But I only sent the list to the french support, so I'll also share it there too in case it can help in any way :)\n\nThanks!\n\n(I am mentionning it there instead of as a bug report if there's the possibility for the first bugs that I mentionned to have a fix shipped in the same hotfix :) )","replies":[{"poster":"TheYasuoMain","date":"2016-05-16T10:02:34.602+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Pretty sure this is what causing the bug, so if this gets fixed, the friends refreshing will be fixed to.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"l lose lp","date":"2016-05-15T15:40:46.562+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hurray!
