Am I the only one who wonders why this is? Before the Champion Mastery patch I can see why this section was blocked off as there was no real need for this. However with the Champion Mastery update don&#039;t you reckon we should be able to see our friends Champions and people who we have played against or with. Id personally like to know the Champions my friends play a lot. I know you can use the Top Champions and the In Progress to see the highest levels they have but showing 9 Champions means you can&#039;t really showcase all your champions. Some people who are proud owners of every Champion could use this to showcase there champions. It would also be nice to know what champions your friends have instead of having to personally ask them. I have personally been in Duo Ranked games where my partner will swap champions with me but because I don&#039;t know what Champions they have and they don&#039;t know what Champions I have can cause a bit of drama between us. \r\n\r\nWhat I am trying to say is that, we should be able to see our friends Champions using this tab on our profile and our friends profile. Does anyone else agree?","replies":[{"poster":"JasonWazza","date":"2015-06-25T05:41:11.717+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"There is (/was i haven't been able to recreate it since 5.11) a bug where if you went to someone else's profile, and then back to your own it would buggedly load their Champion mastery.","replies":[]}]}
