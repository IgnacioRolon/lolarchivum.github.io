Couple of reasons for thisâ€¦ 1, I like to put the summoner I will have less time to use/will use more on F, such as Exhaust or Ignite. Flash will then go in D, unless I have Teleport or Heal, in which case, that's the only reason I put Flash on F. 2, if I fumble for a G ping, and accidentally hit F, if that summoner is something like Exhaust, it won't matter as much as if Flash was on F.\n\nAnyway, just why I do things.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Garens Harem","date":"2015-09-08T12:44:28.354+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"D","replies":[]}]}
