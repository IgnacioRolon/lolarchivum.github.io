It's stat value is too low, it's not powerful, it's hard to use, costs alot of gold and is generally moot by the time you can afford it.\n\nIt might be better if it provided an automatic effect which blocks a single hit from a tower every 45s and was more of a hybrid item, helping cement it as more of an aggressive dominance build from raptor cloak.\nA suggestion of making it build out of raptor cloak and pickaxe, costing 375g to upgrade from these components, and offering \n40 armour, 35 attack damage, 150%base hp regen, the pointrunner passive, and helping to stabilise the classic bruisers a bit more for toplane, by giving them an item that better suits them as lane bullies.\n\nIf we compare maximal usage as of current, it provides 3s of tower disable, equivalent to 3 tower shots if used correctly, on a 120s cooldown. It's a pretty decent increase in power and utility, but I feel with the right fine tuning, and item like this wouldn't be gamebreaking.","replies":[]}]}
