I then submitted a report against my sup for being toxic.\r\n\r\nSo in short what will happen ?","replies":[{"poster":"Sephyre3","date":"2015-07-07T01:57:21.913+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You mean what will happen when people report you for feeding but you were just having a tough game?\n\nYou won't be punished for this. The system will sort out false reports. \n\nWhat's causing the confusion is the idea that losing lane is the same thing as feeding. Losing lane happens to all of us, intentionally feeding the enemy to throw the game is what the system looks for.","replies":[{"poster":"Over Haul","date":"2015-07-07T02:50:49.910+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thanks for the reply, Also the report system is sounding pretty great","replies":[]}]}]}
