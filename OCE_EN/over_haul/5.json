Love watching Cheifs play well vs other regions. They will get wrecked in worlds if they do make it, but they need to start playing tougher opponents.","replies":[{"poster":"Strat","date":"2015-08-29T07:44:20.600+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"This. A friend of mine was convinced that Chiefs would get crushed in Wildcard based on their OPL finals performance, but I knew they could do better than that if they played like they normally did. No doubt they'll get crushed in Worlds but I have a good feeling about this Bo5. Having an OCE team make worlds might convince some of people who trash talk OCE that we aren't such a bad region afterall. I mean, we'll never get to the level of the other regions, but maybe we can give them a run for their money.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Hyde","date":"2015-08-28T21:05:38.910+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I am super hyped!!!!! so awesome!!! and it looks like they will make it too!!!","replies":[]},{"poster":"ABlueQuaker","date":"2015-08-29T08:13:11.744+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Chiefs are going to be going to Worlds by the looks of it. The only teams they lost to didn't make it to the Wildcard Finals, and Chiefs were 2-0 in the Group Stage vs. the team they're versing in the Finals.","replies":[]}]}
