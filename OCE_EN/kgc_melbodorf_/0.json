Its a fair question since both have huge amounts of AD very early in ga,e as well as enormous survivability unless u stun them and since this game rarely has a long enough stun to do anything O&lt; Please explain ? or is the solution just to play top only n make sure u beat garen yourself n die of boredom fro, the endless array of garen tops...","replies":[{"poster":"Wean","date":"2017-03-06T02:57:49.332+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Use Yorick or Illaoi against Garen, otherwise use Jayce, Kennen, or Teemo against Garen, you may also want to try Olaf, just remember if you use Olaf, once Olaf is Level 6, when Garen use his Q on you, just use your ult, and it will remove Garen's silence, and then engage on him, if Garen retreats, Q to him, if Garen use his W and E to engage on you, just retreat a bit, and as soon as Garen's W and E are on cooldown, engage on him, and Q to him.\nCamille should be able to counter Garen.

Change shaco back. They really nerfed him in his current state as compared to before his rework.\n\nI mean instead of blowing everything he has on you now to get you 3/4 hp, he can just press e and do it that way. Because surprise. His old e had a higher scaling alone than his current e and q together has.\n\nAnd garen has a low skill cap, he is also very prone to cc screw overs. Yes he has a lot of damage, yes he is tanky, but can he easily get on top of you? no.","replies":[{"poster":"Nightjar","date":"2017-03-05T01:27:45.438+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"the only thing I can appreciate about new shaco is the fact that he has actually become skillcap with his passive. Like the difference between a shaco main clearing the jungle camps with fast and reasonable jungle clear, and a non-shaco main who takes forever and still gets executed is a kind of rewarding bonus for people who have alot of experience with his kiting.\n\nI hated the rework but I've gotten used to it. Tbh Shaco is pretty similar to rengar if you build ad, just with less damage and more utility and better counterjungling. Also new shaco can still be pretty powerful but you need to mix up the build and really choose what you want to do. Tiamat sunfire has nice clears and is decently tanky and whilst you can't 1v1 kill an enemy, he's pretty decent in skirmishes and is very good at farming and is good even when behind. The old fashioned hydra+shiv build but now with lethality runes instead of atkspeed is nice for splitpushing and has decent damage, it's a very all round build. My personal build right now for maximum impact is rushing a ghostblade into triforce and then eventually getting boots and I don't bother to upgrade my jungle item until much later, since I'm pretty confident in my shaco. This lethality midgame burst rush is horrible if you aren't snowballing and fed, and if you die or don't do much with your lead, but if you are confident, then this build can really get out of hand. AP builds are also alot of fun and viable, though very different from old ap builds and it's less about setting up and more about looking for opportunities. The amount of map control and ap shaco has with a trackers knife is no joke. Also AP shaco top is still going strong and is so much fun to play.\n\nAlso on garen, just like darius, mordekaiser or nasus, in teamfights kite them out and hopefully have a support (or someone else on your team) that can spam cc to keep them in place like morgana, zyra, janna, lux, lulu, alistair, nami, zilean, ect... Garen is countered by a number of toplaners (that I generally consider far more terrifying in experienced hands) like fiora, renekton, morderkaiser, kled, quinn, tryndamere and a few others.","replies":[{"poster":"Talon12","date":"2017-03-05T03:18:39.389+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"done with your recap/rewording of my post yet?","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Wean","date":"2017-03-05T01:53:56.804+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Are you worried that Garen seems to have no counter and that if you facing him in a match you will lose your lane?\nIn one way this is true, and me being a Garen main for a while, I know that Garen counters a lot of top lane champions.\nBut don't overestimate him either, Garen has trouble doing multiple kills within thirty seconds, so in team fights he may not be that good, unlike Darius, Illaoi, etc, those champions are more likely to achieve multikills than Garen would.\nPerhaps use someone like Renekton, Aatrox, maybe Morderkaiser, and even Camille against Garen, and remember, play the waiting game, while using these champions against Garen, do not trade with him until he starts his combo on you.","replies":[]}]}
