Even now I can imagine Illaoi and her tentacles imbued with the power of an element (fire, ice, electricity, light etc). Here's hoping that whatever they end up with gives us something satisfying to clonk our enemies with.","replies":[{"poster":"Bush Feg","date":"2017-07-23T05:02:50.795+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"electricity would be mint, and seeing though there aren't that many electric theme skins out there they could make like a bundle and release a few, hint hint riot","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Monkey Max","date":"2017-07-20T06:06:50.944+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Pool party illaoi was leaked a while ago...

She's useless if the enemy has enough sense to just walk away from her.\n\nI know the feeling, though. I play Taliyah. She's not popular enough for a skin for her to be in high demand, and I'd like to see another skin from her. :(","replies":[{"poster":"Bush Feg","date":"2017-07-19T08:48:29.186+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Well i'm in bronze and it seems people don't understand her so i play her a lot in the hope to climb out, but  still you make a fair point, the love needs to be spread evenly","replies":[]}]}]}
