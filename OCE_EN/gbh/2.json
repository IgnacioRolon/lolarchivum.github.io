I need mature players who will give constructive criticism but also help the other person understand why and what they did wrong and how they can improve on it.. We are all still learning the game so everyone needs to work on everything and if you think you don&#039;t then don&#039;t apply... \r\n\r\nI need players who can put in the effort into the team, everyone needs to be able to put effort into the team or we won&#039;t get anywhere.  If you are a person to quit once it gets hard don&#039;t apply, i don&#039;t want you. I need strong and resilient players.  \r\n\r\nWe can discuss the name of the team or whatever later, I&#039;m just looking for decent players to begin our ascent into higher divisions.\r\n\r\n\r\nPlease fill out this application below..\r\n\r\nIGN:\r\nage: \r\nMic: \r\nLane:\r\nChampion pool:\r\nMain champions (3):\r\nTimes you can play: \r\nStrengths:\r\nweakness: \r\nWhy do you want to join?: \r\n\r\nThanks for reading guys.\r\n                              Have a nice day/afternoon/night?","replies":[{"poster":"Iverns Sperm","date":"2016-06-06T04:11:27.010+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"IGN: Doctor Jekyll\nage: 21\nMic: Yes\nLane: Top/JG\nChampion pool: Gangplank (Lv 7), urgot, maokai, trundle, darius, graves, gnar, malphite, lulu, hecarim (The list goes on forever, i have 377 mastery points so i play a huge pool)\nMain champions (3): Gangplank, Trundle, Maokai (toplane). Kindred, Zac, Hecarim (JG) \nTimes you can play: All day, most of the night (until about 2am AEST)\nStrengths: Very competitive and focused on growth (History in top teir Diablo 3 + WoW), very focused on the macro \"getting the team ahead\" as opposed to padding my KDA. Very willing to adapt and change my style/champions in order to suit the team.\nweakness: Frequency of checking the map - I am using an alert timer to que me to check the map every couple of seconds to improve that. I have hardly played ekko and considering the meta that is something that needs to change, tank ekko can be very usefull in many team compositions so i might need to get some time on him.\nWhy do you want to join?: Because I want a solid, consistent competitive base to climb with. I am not a weekend warrior that plays games as a secondary thing. I play to compete (as i did in previous games) and i intend to do the same with league. I have a style that is very team oriented which makes solo Q difficult, and makes 5 man dynamic absolutely amazing to play in.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Starlord V ","date":"2016-06-04T23:04:18.596+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Just wondering if you're looking for any Rookie Analysts or Management staff unpaid?","replies":[]},{"poster":"BeefyBill","date":"2016-05-31T07:05:44.309+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"ING: TSM YEILOW STAR \nAge: 19\nMic: yes i have one with decent quality awell\nLane: support main but play mid aswell\nChampion pool: every support but thresh for mid i play malz ziggs lb ori karma varuis xerath \nMain champions (3): for support its mostly trundle bard janna/or braum for mid its malz karma varuis/lb\nTimes you can play: all the time in the afternoon \nStrengths: easy to talk with, game focused, love synergy and have a very long time playing league with teams been in 3 tournaments for ool and shotcalled for a team over 2 years of experience with team ranked\nweakness: suffer from adapting out of my role due to now never being able to play anything but support due to dynamic que, i do get salt but thats on if im making mistakes and with past teams understand i get made cause im letting the team down if i don't perform, lastly i like direction if i join and theres no organization or goal i tend to not care as much.\nWhy do you want to join?: been dieing to get a team going but due to the lack of people looking for teams and people having enough skill ive done only small recruiting and making no effort to keep people together due to under performance by others but i miss the friendships made and the awesome games thats teams provide its like playing solo que but people dont have a hammer smashed in there brain people listen and make better decisions more fun and over better experience of the game","replies":[]}]}
