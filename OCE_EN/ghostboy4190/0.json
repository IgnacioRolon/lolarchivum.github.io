All his skins are just minor colour/model changes. Even the runeguard (while it does do the things Telecasterdude says) doesn't really change him 'that' much.\n\nSo no i don't think he needs more 'Skins' he needs one BIG 'Skin' othwewise you become like Teemo and Ezreal who have tons of skins that don't actually do anything to the champ. (minus the obvious exceptions)\n\nHis model texture/animation/ability effects/ability icons/everything else. is all really outdated, when you compare it with the newer champs like Jhin etc.\n\nso if he doesn't get a rework (which is a possibly for a on old champion who doesn't do much but run at/away from the enemy) then he definitely needs a Legendary skin.\n\nHis best skin as it stands is probably his Cop skin, (its the most recognisable one and in terms of colours/shape is the nicest designed) but it is a comedy skin and comedy skins while cool for some people just don't do it for others. (judging by the skins you are recommending for him (dragons layer, mecha, battlecast etc) I'm guessing you are one of those people who don't like them as much.) \n\nI am not a volibear player, and i don't particularly like or hate the champion, so you can be assured that everything i have said is said objectively, without bias.","replies":[{"poster":"ghostboy4190","date":"2016-02-03T09:03:28.283+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"i agree with you on pretty much everything you have said. i am focusing on the 2nd last paragraph on \" (judging by the skins you are recommending for him (dragons layer, mecha, battlecast etc) I'm guessing you are one of those people who don't like them as much.)\" i current play braum supp always with dragon slyer skin untill yesterday the dragon slayer poro icon and a dragon slayer poro ward because why not i also play Bear Cavalry Sejuani and Malphite with his mecha skin i am a lover of the 3 types and do agree he need one big importent skin like a legendary but like what?","replies":[{"poster":"Lord Sesshomaru","date":"2016-02-03T12:08:42.112+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I dont play coli enough to know what would suit him, maybe a feral volibear?
