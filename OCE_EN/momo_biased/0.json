Now that it’s hitting, why does it begin at 11pm? \r\n\r\nI personally had taken the day off work for playing placements and I’m aware that’s not going to be a universal experience. But it’s definitely disappointing that the season starts at a time like that; I can’t remember if a season ever started differently to the day it said in the client before. \r\n\r\nIs it possible to flip the ranked switch earlier (eg. early morning in all regions) or is it set in stone?","replies":[{"poster":"Project Xayah","date":"2020-01-08T00:06:03.924+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"If I'm not mistaken, it appears that Riot's intention is to start the ranked season at a \"universal\" time for all servers, with NA starting at 4am (PST), which means that OCE starts at 11pm (AEDT), so I would imagine changing the time for any server (particularly this close to the actual season start date) isn't something they'd do.\n\nEDIT: So, looking back at the patch notes for OCE, the time for season start has been changed to \"4am\", so I'd imagine it's probably a case where the time was incorrectly localised as being 4am PST (which would put it 11pm AEDT), rather than 4am local time (which means OCE *should* get season start at 4am AEDT if that's the case).","replies":[{"poster":"Dragonzord86","date":"2020-01-09T12:11:23.548+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Project Xayah,realm=OCE,application-id=FjGAIbRv,discussion-id=Lvq4g01N,comment-id=0000,timestamp=2020-01-08T00:06:03.924+0000)\n>\n> If I'm not mistaken, it appears that Riot's intention is to start the ranked season at a \"universal\" time for all servers, with NA starting at 4am (PST), which means that OCE starts at 11pm (AEDT), so I would imagine changing the time for any server (particularly this close to the actual season start date) isn't something they'd do.\n> \n> EDIT: So, looking back at the patch notes for OCE, the time for season start has been changed to \"4am\", so I'd imagine it's probably a case where the time was incorrectly localised as being 4am PST (which would put it 11pm AEDT), rather than 4am local time (which means OCE *should* get season start at 4am AEDT if that's the case).\n\nThat's what confuses me man. Coz OCE is such a large area. You've got NZ, then west aus. so a 4AM start NZ time is 11PM on the 9th in my time in Perth...","replies":[{"poster":"Project Xayah","date":"2020-01-09T12:22:56.556+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"OCE always runs off AEDT/AEST, since the server is located in Sydney, so a 4am start should put it at 1am AWST (if I'm not mistaken), and 6am NZDT (if I'm not mistaken).\n\nThe main confusion here seems to be because the OCE patch notes originally stated 11pm with no time zone attached (though presumably AEDT), and has since been changed to 4am with no time zone attached, which would indicate an incorrect localisation (in my opinion).\n\nI'm trying to get confirmation one way or the other at the moment, so when I hear back I'll update here with the correct ranked start time (and I'll make sure it's localised properly, time zone included).","replies":[{"poster":"Gehirn","date":"2020-01-10T04:32:09.027+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Project Xayah is correct!
