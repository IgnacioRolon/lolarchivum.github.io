When I logged back in the following day I had a leave buster notification popup, forcing me to type \"I agree\" to some conditions about leaving games.\n\n**This is the first time that Ive ever not finished a game***  I've got over:\n   350 normal wins\n   25 ranked wins\n   200 bot game wins. \n\nSo it would stand to reason I've probably played around 1000 games +/-  and 1 game I've gone missing from. That's around 0.1% games I've gone missing from and not finished.\n\nI'm actually quite offended that I had to agree to something like I was a serial game leaver. I hate AFKer's & people who frequently leave games, and I agree something harsh needs to be done to stop this type of behavior. At the same time however it is in no way fair or reasonable in my opinion to do this type of thing to people with an outstanding history and such a low leave rate.\n\nHas anyone else run into this type of thing? or was I just lucky and the exception to the rule?","replies":[{"poster":"xXPandaLoveXx","date":"2014-12-15T12:55:02.273+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Scuse me jimz.... i got a one game low priority and the timer keeps refreshing....halp","replies":[]},{"poster":"Jimz","date":"2014-12-11T04:49:29.744+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'm sorry if you feel offended. \n\nSurprisingly, not everyone understands the impact of their actions, so the aim for that message is to educate the player on the impact of leaving a game early. \n\nWe want ALL our players to be made aware of the negative impact as soon as possible, so it is triggered after your first afk.\n\n\ntl;dr it's not a penalty, and it's definitely not personal.

You don't have to be logged in to tick the box & there is only 1 agreement per application not log in. there is no way to prove who agreed to it. the player account owner or random person in the household who opened the application by mistake.\n\n2.) Most of terms wouldn't pass the fairness test more info here and would be deemed to be taking advantage of a lesser party: http://www.consumerlaw.gov.au/content/the_acl/downloads/unfair_contract_terms_guide.PDF \n\n2 a.) They could probably be enforced for a free player although even that is arguable as time spent playing could be seen as tangible investment into the game (but could go either way),\n\n2 b.)  Anyone who has spent any money with enough effort and persistence with the ACCC / small claims court would be able to overturn any account banning for any reason, temporary suspensions of the account for small periods of times would probably be seen as reasonable and wouldn't be able to be over turned.\n\n3.) He noted that the law is mostly untested in regards to online terms of service, but as the servers are based in Australia, the purchases are in Australian dollars and go through the Australian Pay Pal servers there is no doubt that Australian consumer laws would apply and however untested they are in regards to online usage and \"virtual goods & services\" they are well tested with physical services (mobile phone contracts...etc) and as there is evidence that accounts are being sold for real world money via e-bay / other services (despite being against the T&C's) it proves that there is a real physical value to the virtual products / service.\n\n4.) He mentioned until one or two of these types of things go to court and have an outcome there is no president \"there is no formal process to deal with this complaint at consumer protection\".\n\n5.) There are currently \"white papers\" being drafted with legislation specific to app purchases and in game app purchases, and whilst these will be primarily designed for iphones...etc they will also apply to internet online games like LOL as well.\n\nHe is an avid gamer as well (mainly why we've kept in contact all these years) and is quite curious and is really hoping for a few of these to go to court so he can see if what he thinks would happen will happen.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Project Xayah","date":"2014-12-12T00:05:45.753+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"This.

Sorry for the wall of text.\n\nYeah i actually read both of them this patch to see. It does say not to intentionality leave but says nothing about the new leavebuster system. However there is some old clause in them about Crowd Sourcing and the Tribunal that no longer exists, so i would go fix that up if the Tribunal doesnt currently have any effect.\n\nAnd it could be difficult to prove if there was any intention to leave the game, rather than maybe a Disconnect/Blackout/Too Laggy. \n\nI feel if players are lagging too much to prevent them from feeding, they should be able to avoid combat to minimise feeding and snowballing. The last thing you want is someone lagging and feeding uncontrollably because their net cant handle a youtube video and LoL at the same time. Instead of putting their team behind by feeding due to lag, they could sit in the safety of the fountain until the lag subsides(if it does), this way it has less of a negative impact than straight up leaving/feeding uncontrollably.","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"PervySage79","date":"2014-12-11T05:11:08.889+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Jimz,realm=OCE,application-id=Ntey9fRZ,discussion-id=U7IHNnWV,comment-id=0000,timestamp=2014-12-11T04:49:29.744+0000)\n> I'm sorry if you feel offended. \n> \n> Surprisingly, not everyone understands the impact of their actions, so the aim for that message is to educate the player on the impact of leaving a game early. \n> \n> We want ALL our players to be made aware of the negative impact as soon as possible, so it is triggered after your first afk.\n> \n> \n> tl;dr it's not a penalty, and it's definitely not personal.
