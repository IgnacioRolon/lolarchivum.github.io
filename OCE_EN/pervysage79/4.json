Sure at low MMR & bot games he will still own as no-one has any brains and everyone just charges in and dies one after another, but at higher MMR's where you have to be exceptionally strategic with your Heimer playing to get kills and make a difference for your team this indirect nerf has made Heimers donger limp :(\n\nTo balance this out, and to make Heimer viable again he either needs a:\na.) A boost to his towers base damage. \nb.) A replacement item that boosts his tower damage.\nc.) Change to the scaling of AP damage on his towers so it grows quicker and earlier.\n\nAre there any other players who main Heimer and feeling the pain of the Banner of Command change? or if you have found an item that replaces Banner as your main item & smooths the stupidly low early to mid game damage he suffers from please let me know. I'm on the verge of giving up on my donger :(","replies":[{"poster":"SkarSkarSkarner","date":"2014-11-27T17:35:36.487+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> Since the Banner of Command item has had its 15% increased pet damage removed, Heimerdinger has had his damaged dramatically reduced especially considering that his main damage item (his towers) only get 5% AP damage until level 8, and then only increases by 3.5% per level until level 18. \n\n \nThat is turret health, not damage. Anybody who mains Heimerdinger shouldn't have any problem playing him since the latest patch. If they do, they are really bad.\n\n","replies":[{"poster":"PervySage79","date":"2014-11-28T03:29:44.137+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":">  \n> That is turret health, not damage.
