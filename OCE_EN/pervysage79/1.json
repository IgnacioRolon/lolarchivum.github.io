Does anyone have any tips? he wrecks me the second he reaches level 6. Any advice anyone can offer would be gretly appreciated.\r\n\r\nThanks in advance","replies":[{"poster":"Rav","date":"2014-12-01T12:09:01.068+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Talon main here.\n\nPretty much you need to know the range of his E and W, that is the key to beating Talon as a mage or a ranged champion. His E (RIP 2soon) doesn't silence anymore so you have to have good reactions to respond to that. His ult shouldn't destroy your towers in 1 hit. That's if he's already fed and is stacking AD.  Rush Zhonyas, as soon as you see him E to you, activate your Zhonyas. Your turrets should do their work and he cannot proceed to kill you if you're under your tower. Just poke him and know the range of his E, that is extremely frustrating as a Talon in mid lane. This is even better if the Talon started longsword instead of a flask so he can abuse baddies who don't know where to position themselves. Playing Talon yourself will make you realize Talon's weaknesses too. Like the Lee Sin says, master your enemy.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Blaene","date":"2019-09-21T16:45:11.820+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Heimerdinger main here. I've always insta-died to Talon. However, I figured out last night that the strategic placement of Heim's turrets can help me stay in from on creepscore and levels. I set the my turrets and then I fight well behind them out of range.  He did kill the turrets but I just keep refreshing them and focused on last hitting. It actually worked out well because I didn't run out of mana launching grenades and rockets. I just used my rockets to last hit creeps occasionally.\n\nAnother tip if you want to be aggressive with Heim is to push hard in the first 6 levels so you well advance and out creep him. And I rush Rylais for the slow.","replies":[]},{"poster":"PervySage79","date":"2014-12-03T15:58:18.194+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"After playing Talon & seeing what you meant about his range combined with a pink ward I can now beat him in the laning stage with my donger.
