Haven't touched ranked since due to no motivation and elo decay has set me in S4 now. If you can find or know other players enough for a team i would love to join. I can pretty much main any and every role as i am equally good at all of them.\nIf i had to choose though i would prefer either adc or top.\nThanks!","replies":[]}]}
