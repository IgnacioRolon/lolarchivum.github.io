I just can&#039;t help it, I don&#039;t know what the root of it is, but even muting players doesn&#039;t work for me. I&#039;ve been playing since 2012 and have never been as toxic as I am in 2017, can anyone try and give me some tips or something to do to help out, I just don&#039;t have the patience or mental fortitude to hold myself back.\r\n\r\nProbably posting this in the wrong section or it&#039;s just a dumb question, thanks anyway!\r\n\r\n {{sticker:zombie-nunu-bummed}}","replies":[{"poster":"Easley","date":"2017-10-23T11:35:59.204+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"unbind your enter key","replies":[{"poster":"Sorry Im toxic","date":"2017-10-23T20:53:38.910+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I think you're actually a genius!","replies":[]},{"poster":"Akkordian Zoeve","date":"2017-10-23T18:50:46.407+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hmm...

Another thing is to lighten to mood by memeing a lil :)","replies":[{"poster":"Zaps","date":"2017-10-24T09:43:42.416+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"This is the advice that I personally tend to follow! Letting it out in a different context can help to relieve the tension that can come from the rough games. \n\nAnother way, (which appeals to my own sense of self interest) is to think of your chat as a tool to help you win the game.  Basically, before you send a message think \"Does this actually improve my chances of winning the game?\". Naturally, things that tend to pass this check involve tactical things as well as keeping your team on the positive side. \n\nThis is a pretty mercantile way of thinking about things - but it tends to help me focus better on the right things to say in chat.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Canc","date":"2017-10-24T05:13:01.907+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I dont mute people, in fact I read all their chat so I have evidence when I report them.\n\nI just love reporting people, I dont say anything, I report them and provide them a chance to be banned.

I don't like muting people. I'll report them after the game, but I don't like muting them. What I do is I rage *out loud*. Riot won't know, and can't ban you, plus it's much more satisfying.
