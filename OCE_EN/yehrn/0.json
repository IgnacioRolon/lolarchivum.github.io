While this happens, I have no control over my character, so they keep running in the direction they are facing, and killing minions as they go along (usually resulting in my death). Another bug I have encountered is one that does not let me open the shop, regardless of whether i click on it, or press the P button (to open shop). All of these bugs that I have encountered (from what I hear from others) only happens on Mac clients and usually lasts for between 30 seconds to a minute.\r\nPlease fix these bugs ASAP as it affects everyone&#039;s games immensely!\r\nThank you.","replies":[{"poster":"HORSE OF FORCE","date":"2015-03-26T11:10:33.565+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":">**DO NOT** post bug reports here.
