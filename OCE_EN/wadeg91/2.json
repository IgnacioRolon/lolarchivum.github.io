Upon a whole heap of different things they asked me to do, they asked me to check the Direct-X Diagnostic section and follow the instructions given. It states I have to hold the Windows icon and press R, which brings up a little window in which they&#039;ve asked me to type in &#039;crnd&#039; and it says that the code(or whatever you call it) couldn&#039;t be found.\r\nIn saying that, I&#039;m going to assume that&#039;s my issue. So can anyone help me out by telling me what I need to do/download, or whatever so that I have that file.\r\n\r\nPs: Around a week or so ago I had to contact Dell (my laptop is Dell). And there was an issue, so they manually updated my drivers for me. And I&#039;m thinking that is my issue.\r\nSo if there&#039;s anyone that knows what the issues may be, or if I need to provide more information for you to understand furthermore, can you please let me know.\r\n\r\nThanks for your time,\r\n\r\nWadeG28","replies":[{"poster":"SephirothSG","date":"2016-04-23T08:42:25.191+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey there,\n\nHave you tried everything on [this support article](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/202536660-Issues-with-the-League-of-Legends-Store-PvP-Net-) regarding store issues?\n\nAlso they asked you to run **cmd** (C M D, not rn as you've attempted according to your OP.)","replies":[]}]}
