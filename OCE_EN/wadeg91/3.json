That they should be banned from the game for a period of time?\r\nOr something.

In the new champion select you can select your 2 primary roles and be guaranteed them every time you queue.\n\nSadly you can only use this new champion select in ranked on OCE, since draft pick normals have not been enabled yet. It doesn't look like we'll have draft pick normals anytime soon either according to **Riot Sephyre**.\n\n> [{quoted}](name=Sephyre,realm=OCE,application-id=3fteLeTW,discussion-id=VdoPT9GX,comment-id=00010000,timestamp=2016-04-11T00:58:27.786+0000)\n>\n> Normal Draft is not likely to be opened up anytime soon. That said, we do evaluate for it, and if we grow to the point of being able to support it we would open it up.\n\nAs of right now your best option is to reach level 30 and queue in ranked with the new champion select system.","replies":[{"poster":"Ingénue","date":"2016-04-22T01:23:08.728+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Alternatively, You could play constantly with four friends. Playing as a 5 will definitely lessen your chances of being matched with trollers/afks/other toxins. It also allows you to become familiar with the play patterns of your teammates (so you don't have to keep adjusting your style every game) and you have way better communication. There is literally no reason not to. You also get lots of cool bonuses like extra IP, mastery points and Hextech stuff ♥","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Vanilla Bread","date":"2016-04-21T20:07:05.772+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"ranked?","replies":[]}]}
