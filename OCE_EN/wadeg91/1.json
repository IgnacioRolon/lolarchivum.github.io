I Didn't Actually Do Anything.","subforum":"Help & Support (OCE)","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I know majority of people won&#039;t care about this. But I&#039;ve been wrong done by.\r\n\r\nI have received a two week suspension on my account for something I haven&#039;t done, and have no idea about. I haven&#039;t even been banned before, and it&#039;s an automatic two week ban..? Is there any point in playing anymore?\r\nAnd it&#039;s the most pathetic reason why.\r\n1. There&#039;s no explanation.\r\n2. Two week ban for something I haven&#039;t done?\r\n3. Two weeks for a first time supposed &#039;offense&#039;. Wtf?! \r\n\r\nAs 99% of you know, when pre-game begins that majority of people will call a spot as fast as they can. Well, I&#039;ve called jungle before the 4 others joined the room, 3 others called spots which left Support available, so I&#039;ve selected my jungler champ and locked it in, and someone else called NoHope called jungle afterwards, and then started abusing me, and saying I was lying. So I posted the chat log to show I actually did say it first, to which he stopped talking, because 2 other people agreed with me.\r\nThen once the game began, he started off by saying &#039;Oh sorry, I forgot to change&#039; even though he auto-locked?\r\nSo we had 2 junglers with smite..\r\n\r\nI know it isn&#039;t ranked matches, but the fact that this happened, and I couldn&#039;t do anything about it. So I let my little nephew play whilst I went and did something else until that game finished.\r\nAnd once that game finished, I jumped on to start another game with my friends, and I was banned.\r\n\r\nRiot sent me an email with a link explaining why, yet there&#039;s no explanation in the link?\r\nI can&#039;t see what happened in that game, and my nephew said he didn&#039;t do anything too stupid besides die a fair bit.","replies":[{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2016-04-26T02:35:44.407+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It looks like you've been banned for intentionally feeding, and it should say so in the reform card (the link that was emailed to you).
