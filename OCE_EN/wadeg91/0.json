Yet I&#039;d be reported for being a jungler when there&#039;s another jungler there although I called it first.\r\n\r\nIs there anything I can do?\r\n\r\nI know I sound like I&#039;m complaining, but when it happens to you almost every single game, and you show them that you called the lane before they joined and they tell you to KYS, or get f@#ked, or something about my family.. \r\nBut I&#039;m over it. What can I do? Besides uninstall and play a different game?","replies":[{"poster":"The Spawn Man","date":"2016-05-13T15:13:21.194+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Learn to call 'Fill'. I just learnt a few champs in the two lanes I didn't main just so I could remove the hassle of calling lanes.\n\nOr you could play the real version of LoL and play ranked, where you never have to fight for lanes.
