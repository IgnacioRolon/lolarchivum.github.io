Things like degrading and/or insulting others and rank/stat shaming can certainly contribute to a punishment. Based on information provided, couldn't say I'm 100% confident that it's definitely deserved, but there could be games that haven't shown up with the reform card (which could happen depending on the time frame between offending games), and it's also possible that the term \"retarted\" may have contributed. Will have to recommend you to Support to get more info and explore the possibility of a false positive.\n\nCouple other things I want to mention, first of which is; you are being judged on your own behaviour, not the behaviour of others. No player is judged on a scale of \"you did the wrong thing, but they did something worse\", it is *always* simply \"you did the wrong thing\". It sucks to be treated like shit by someone, but it is not your place to retaliate or issue punishment to them, and doing so often puts you in a bad place.\n\nOften players who are engaging in such behaviour do so in order to get a response, and so the best way to deal with them is to deprive them of that. It's not easy, but putting the effort in can allow you to gain a better sense of control over you need/desire to retaliate against such individuals, and there are a variety of ways you can go about that. Something that can help is to have an outlet for such emotions. For example; exercise, martial arts, drawing/painting, or puzzles/riddles etc. may provide a way to channel frustration into something more constructive.","replies":[{"poster":"JasonWazza","date":"2019-09-11T08:04:29.237+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"\"but there could be games that haven't shown up with the reform card\"\n\nAlmost like this has been an issue for years upon years, and hasn't been fixed for some reason.\n\n\"but it is not your place to retaliate or issue punishment to them, and doing so often puts you in a bad place.\"\n\nYeah doing so almost always gets you banned, even though they tend to avoid bans while doing this stuff for long periods of time.","replies":[{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2019-09-11T09:10:22.182+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"You can play a game and be reported + flagged for negative activity, but not trigger the system (minor negativity, first instance of bad behaviour, etc). These games contribute to negative history but not always directly to a particular punishment, in much the same way as a prior punishment will impact how the system reacts to your subsequent behaviour.\n\nYou could consider such games as little red flags. Games that wouldn't trigger a punishment and aren't really worth a warning, but demonstrate behaviour that can become problematic if it continues and/or escalates. \n\nIncluding such games in the reform cards would imply that those games were what triggered the punishment when they aren't. The negative history prompts the system to look closer at a given player, and shortens the leeway allowed. In essence, it can impact *when* a punishment happens, but does not impact the punishment itself.","replies":[{"poster":"JasonWazza","date":"2019-09-11T09:43:37.394+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"So what your saying is Riot's whole \"we want you to reform, so we ban(/chat restrict) you instantly when the bad behaviour happens, and give you those logs so you can reflect on your actions\"\n\nMeans nothing.\n\nSince what your saying implies the above system that Riot has said is the way it's working for years isn't how it works.\n\nSo the instant feedback system is useless, and can't provide a way to reform, because you literally don't actually see the bad behaviour that leads to the ban.","replies":[{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2019-09-11T09:59:42.489+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"That's not what I said at all....\n\nE.G. You get frustrated in a game and tell someone \"go f yourself\". It's undeniably toxic, but also really not that bad and not worth a punishment on its own.\n\nWhat it can be is an indicator of a shift in behaviour, but for *the vast majority* of the population, it's a one-game here and there type deal and the behaviour will not be repeated with any sort of consistency.\n\nIt's background information that basically works like a character witness.

The whole point of having a learning system that doesn't function on keywords (other than the impossibility of that feat), is so there can be some degree of tailoring to encourage reform.\n\nYou don't achieve reformation by punishing to the utmost the slightest infractions. You understand that people aren't perfect, and aren't expected to be, but demonstrate boundaries when a behaviour crosses the line.\n\nYou don't expel a kid from school for running in the hallways, but a kid who is constantly ignoring the warnings against running in the hallways may get less leeway upon doing something more serious, or may eventually face some form of punishment in the hopes of stopping the behaviour before they seriously injure themselves or someone else.\n\nThe reform card shows what ultimately triggered the punishment because that is what is relevant to the punishment, and to the actions the player in question has to take (or not take) to improve their behaviour and avoid further punishment.","replies":[{"poster":"JasonWazza","date":"2019-09-11T12:06:16.897+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The OP has stuff that looks like it's so deserving of a ban that one of you guys had this to say \n\n\"Based on information provided, couldn't say I'm 100% confident that it's definitely deserved\"\n\nLegitimately if you think this 100% deserves a ban, i really think you need to get checked.\n\nBut assuming it is enough to deserve a ban, Riot's own systems flat out don't work.\n\nBut hey he can really reform based off this considering his chat restriction has nothing to do with the logs he was shown.\n\nAt least tribunal cards were forced to have relevant shit in them.\n\nOh which speaking of.\n\n\"It's background information that basically works like a character witness.

Even a ban maybe? Are they consistently low-tier negative or have they literally just come off a punishment? *We don't know*. Support does, hence the recommendation to ticket support. They can provide more context for cases that are less cut and dry.\n\nSometimes we can offer that context, sometimes it requires a deeper understanding of the specific *personal* history that we just don't have access to. Sometimes it's as bit of both.\n\nThe reform card shows the exact game(s) that triggered the system, and yes, in some cases it can be lacking context, but if the system were to provide every shred of context then 1. it would go the way of \"Terms and conditions\" and barely anyone would actually read it, 2. It makes it harder for players to understand what behaviour is the problem and needs changing, and what behaviour is just used contextually, and 3. It gives people a means to game the system.\n\nThe OPs entire chat log is negative. Do I think more context is necessary to recognise that and recognise it is problematic? No, which means the reform card has done its job. Do I think there is more context that can be provided upon request? Absolutely, and it is there if OP asks for it.\n\nYou give the *necessary* information first, and (ideally, repeat it last), because that is what will stick. The deeper essay length context is useful for some (i.e those that ask for it), but not for everyone, and there are those that will look at that wall and read none of it.\n\nThis is also where that vocal minority bias comes in. If a player is coming to boards, it's because they are seeking either context or validation in one form or another. Players aren't going to come to boards to say \"Hey, I got this punishment, I know exactly why and it was totally deserved\" are they? There's no point.","replies":[{"poster":"JasonWazza","date":"2019-09-11T12:44:30.666+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"\"As in, there is more to this, and we as random strangers on the internet don't have that information.\"\n\nNo as in there isn't enough information provided in the logs.\n\n\"The OPs entire chat log is negative.
