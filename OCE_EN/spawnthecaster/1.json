I also enjoy reading fantasy, currently reading the Dwarfs books, but loved Feist&#039;s Magician series, and Edding&#039;s Balgariad.\r\nI have watched every Worlds championship (AP Alistair OP) and the WCG&#039;s (RIP Rusty) and historically was a huge TSM fan.\r\nBefore esports I spent 3 years working in insurance in Melbourne - weird career change I know.\r\n\r\nSo AMA!

In the end I was never passionate enough to get mechanically good enough at the game. Never was really :) but I loved the theory crafting and public speaking so Analyst / Coach / Caster made the most sense to me.\n\nI got picked up by Riot by getting a try out through Atlus, and then trying to work on everything I could. Nowadays its probably easier, reach out to Julian (pastrytime) or myself with your work. we can get you in contact with some cool people.\n\nHope this helps and never give up <3\n\nCheers","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"KSHarrison","date":"2016-01-13T02:57:27.164+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"On a more serious note, huge fan of you and Rusty here :) I give you guys props in every reddit thread (GoDyrusGo) because your analysis is always teaching me something when I watch, sometimes small details that I'm like \"damn good point!\" Definitely hope you two get more visibility through 2016. Congrats btw on Worlds :)\n\nEven cooler that you're a fan of Raymond E Feist's Magician books and David Edding's BElgariad. Those are some of the first fantasy books I grew up with man. Did you read the Mallorian too? Belgarath was such a chief, probably my first favorite fantasy character. I still remember when he solo beasted Ctuchik in book 3. He fascinated me as a kid like a super saiyan did for others. I had to reread the passage several times it was so sick. Also liked the thief prince, Keldar I think his name was.\n\nWhat's been your favorite final fantasy? Those are the RPGs I got started on as a kid, played 4, 6, 7, 9 and 12. Tried 8 halfway but I found the Junction system too tedious and I was on a rom at that point so the game in general was outdated as a newcomer. You ever play Xenogears? If you're cooking for a retro RPG, and since it seems we might have similar tastes in style, let me tell you that the plot in Xenogears is hands down the best I've ever encountered in a video game and totally worth checking out if you're into that thing.\n\nAwesome that you're (or began as) a TSM fan too. I've been since S1. Currently doing grad school abroad in Germany for chemistry and struggling to find joy. I love esports though; it's been my consistent hobby for a couple years now. Since you made such a radical career shift yourself, could you share the details of how you managed it if you get a chance? It's hard to find time myself being busy with school, but it's still nice to read these stories.\n\nCheers man and thanks for the read.

We try to teach and entertain, and hearing people thank us for it makes our day! <3\n\nYeah I did read the Mallorian, and the Ellenium I think its called (same author new characters). Eddings is baller! Kheldar is a beast (silk the thief). Definately my favourite character from the books.\n\nFinal Fantasy 9 is probably the fave from the series. The game play was super fast and fun.\n\nHavent played XenoGears, but I will definately check it out.\n\nMy story is weird. I started on the NA server as a diamond player and made a team. A high elo player thought I would be a good pick up (he was very wrong! ;) ) and I played some local tournaments and online stuff. When I got a fulltime jobe (season 2) I went back to casual, and met Atlus through a friend. From there I casted some stuff and he recomended Riot try me out. Last year, with OPL kicking off and LPL needing a team I was picked up fulltime. \n\nTheres obviously lots more to it, but it was honestly about not giving up and chasing it.\n\nThanks for the questions and hopefully see you round :D","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"KSHarrison","date":"2016-01-13T02:42:46.173+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Why do you try to look like Rusty?\n\n(PST: It's @BeFairPlz on Twitter and Rusty made me do it.)","replies":[]},{"poster":"Smite","date":"2016-01-13T02:41:03.413+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey Spawn, love the casting!\n\nFew questions from me,\n\nWhat made you decide to make shoutcasting your career?\nDid you have any inspirations when you started?\nHave you cast any games other than LoL?\nWhy did you decide to look like RUSTY???\n\n{{summoner:11}}","replies":[]},{"poster":"Loote","date":"2016-01-13T02:19:46.810+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"can you teach me how to take selfies pls","replies":[{"poster":"SephirothSG","date":"2016-01-13T02:21:44.537+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Loote,realm=OCE,application-id=Ntey9fRZ,discussion-id=OmR9kPAB,comment-id=0000,timestamp=2016-01-13T02:19:46.810+0000)\n>\n> can you teach me how to take selfies pls\n\nI would also like to learn this essential skill.","replies":[{"poster":"SpawnTheCaster","date":"2016-01-13T02:37:29.140+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Its all about angle and the smirk. 2 core components! also helps if you have no shame of taking them in public!\n\nBut beware - friends will get jealous and try and photo bomb you, at this point you need to have reflexes of a mongoose to not be trolled!","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Dranger","date":"2016-01-13T02:20:56.415+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Well i think i'll start with the really easy one, If you could rank the OPL teams for next split, Who would come where ((Might as well do LPL as well since someone else will ask that :P ))","replies":[{"poster":"SpawnTheCaster","date":"2016-01-13T02:49:39.345+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Ranking teams is hard.
