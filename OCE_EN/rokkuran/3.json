I needed very little to do so, so little that a win or a loss would have ticked me over into Rank 5. Anyway in the game I achieved S- for Kindred and in the post game lobby it did the nice animation, then the pop up came saying you achieve rank 5 with Kindred. After I closed that tab it then said I had earned an Token for rank 6 for Kindred for achieveing an S-/S/S+ rank on Kindred. Stoked that I got one, but I only checked recently in the Hextech creation tab, I do not have a mastery token for Kindred. Is it a bug because I earned it the same time I earned rank 5? Or did I misread something? Not sure. If i knew it might been a bug I would have taken a screenshot. What do I do?","replies":[{"poster":"SephirothSG","date":"2016-06-11T09:47:09.857+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey there,\n\nWas this in hexakill?\n\nFeatured game modes do not reward mastery tokens, however you _can_ earn hextech chests/keys afaik.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Scrubing","date":"2016-06-10T11:27:26.749+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I am in the same boat my friend, in Hexakill,(which i believe is meant to contribute to masters tokens) I  got an S in my latest game, and I was credited for the S in the after game screen, however in the crafting section I did not receive a token for that game.","replies":[]}]}
