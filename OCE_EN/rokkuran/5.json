I'm fine with that. I'd prefer not to be there but I see why it has been put in place; to stop people from going afk or leaving game for particular reason. However the consequences are really ridiculous. I understand they are put in place to prevent people from such negative or toxic behaviour but to be honest, I lack the compassion to get out of low priority, or play League of Legends in general.\r\n\r\nThe punishment should make them revalue what they are doing in game, not whether they should stop playing the game.\r\n\r\nFor those who have never been in low priority, before you queue you must wait 'X' amount of minutes before queuing into a game of League for a particular number of games. (I believe) ranked play is also disabled during this time. For me the 'X' is 20 minutes. So before I can start queuing games I must wait 20 minutes each time. Now if miss queue, stop queue or anything similar, I must wait 20 minutes each time before I can queue. Every time I try to queue, a majority times I miss the queue pop because I've been waiting so long I forget I even queued in the first place. I then realise I have to wait another 20 minutes and usually go do something else.\r\n\r\nI think there about better ways to create a low priority system than the one that's in effect. For example, in Dota 2, Low Priority players can only queue against low priority players, with ranked play disabled for them. Match queues are longer because the pool of available players are smaller but there is no waiting unnecessary.\r\n\r\nRight now, I lack the compassion to play League like I did before because of this system. I don't blame Riot for enforcing this system, but I think it's the wrong way to approach the situation.","replies":[{"poster":"HORSE OF FORCE","date":"2015-02-22T02:45:49.950+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Prisoner's Island never gets good results.
