His kit seems weird to play as your kit focus you to be extremely squishy to do lots of damage with your ult or be really tanky and not really offer a whole lot. I think with the whole fiora/poppy/shen/taric reworks he has kinda slipped under the radar. Was wondering if knew if they planned to work or change him?","replies":[{"poster":"GigaPube","date":"2016-01-22T11:55:02.416+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"lost? hes consistently +50% winrate. less commonly played as support and probably his least favourable role\n\ni think its obvious his best \"kit\" is to exploit his passive, building only MR items and being against a heavy AP team. unfortunately thats when he becomes nearly OP, but other than that hes not as useful as other champs in top/mid can be. so being either OP in a game or not an optimal pick, that doesnt seem like a good \"curve\" for effectiveness in specific games\n\nhes always been under the radar, hes been the least or 2nd least played champ for nearly 2 years straight\n\ni dont think a galio rework would be higher priority than a taric one at the very least, and personally i expect to see other champs get reworked ahead of him too like aatrox/rammus/yi/tryn","replies":[]},{"poster":"Sailor Jupiter","date":"2016-01-22T07:30:00.512+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I think Galio is pretty decent at the moment. He has great base damages and a fantastic ult so you can be pretty flexible with his build. His ult isn't really about the damage, it's more about locking people down so the rest of your team can get into position and finish the fight.","replies":[]},{"poster":"SorakaXHealBoT","date":"2016-01-22T05:55:46.302+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"He is good against Heavy Ap team which obviously isn't meta right now and is probably why he isn't doing very well.","replies":[]},{"poster":"CatchTheseHands","date":"2016-01-22T04:08:35.288+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"No!
