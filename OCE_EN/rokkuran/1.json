While I was playing he said &quot;What&#039;s Grievous Wounds?&quot;. I told him what it was but I realised that nowhere in the game does it say what it does. It is just implied that people know what it is. They should expand on the description on items like Morellonomicon and Executioner&#039;s Calling (I believe they are the main two items that have it, I think some spells have it too) as all it says is that it lasts x amount of seconds. I can see as a new player, they would never had know what it was until somebody told them, as it doesn&#039;t say it.\r\n\r\nIs it possible to make changes like that? Would be a lot helpful to new/lower tier players who don&#039;t understand what the concept is or does.","replies":[{"poster":"Fitzky","date":"2016-04-08T10:30:35.928+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"When you get the debuff it appears as an icon on your screen and if you highlight over it, it tells you the effect.

Its a simple thing that isn't explained yet so many things they try to give us \"information\" about for power.
