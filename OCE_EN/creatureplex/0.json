But now with spellthief&#039;s edge, she gets a lot of gold just from dropping her aoe plus the mana regen buff it got made it op for support mages that grab it due to it making Morgana being able to spam her aoe and with thunderlord&#039;s decree she&#039;s no longer punishable when she misses what used to be the main reason she was a support is that snare.\r\n\r\nNow Lux-Lux with Thunderlord&#039;s Decree is like a loss lane waiting to happen, she went from a very annoying strong poker that did moderate damage with her aoe, to taking half your health with one aoe blast and mainly being because of her aoe that procs thunderlord&#039;s decree. Because of how strong thunderlord&#039;s decree blast with her aoe is, she now doesn&#039;t even feel the need to get a gold item, as she just builds doran&#039;s ring and goes mejai souleater and gets tons of stacks. Before her aoe didn&#039;t kill you and drain so much health it hurt and you didn&#039;t want to take a free hit but now her aoe is very hurtful and the slow is just another pain as it&#039;s easier for her to hit her snare as well. \r\n\r\nSo what I supposed, buff the other keystones, and nerf spellthief&#039;s edge so that aoes no longer proc it so that both Lux, and Morgana and any other aoe mage that abuses this can no longer abuse it, therefore no more one hit half health situations from those 2 sisters of pain. Honestly I still feel that supports shouldn&#039;t be grabbing thunderlord&#039;s decree when they have another keystone that makes their shields much stronger and lasting longer buffing that I think would even out the keystones and push a lot of supports to grab that instead of a damage dealing keystone which is completely wrong and just makes supports that grab it into other apcs.","replies":[{"poster":"shdwzone","date":"2016-09-26T05:44:01.527+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"lv 1 Bard auto with 3 chimes, with {{item:3303}}  hits like a truck, can easy do 150dmg with an auto or do 200+ if u can land a Q AA, same with zyra having her plants proc Thunderlords and the gold passive, as much as an AOE proc and them getting the gold very easy, i feel that there is no dmg involved as long as u dont just stand  in the AOE from Morgana/Lux, they are both very strong mid or sup currently and can just farm with out to many issues, but there is alot worse, as mentioned above. As nither lux/morg can do that kind of damage with out a combo. But you have other champs like lulu,sona,karma,zyra,bard  ect that can do massive damage to you with singe attacks with out the use of AOE ( brand/karma are 50/50 single target damage but can also do AOE).  I think as a item it does very well early but once you get into mid/late game it drops off and your only using the slow for the most part.   As for other abilitys depending on how you play, you will always have a choice of what mysteries you run, i have multiple pages where its set up for aggressive or def depending on the match up, and you also try to counter pick ( if your talking norms well then you cant do this )  Sorry for the book but i just cant seem to see your issues when there is obvious and simple solutions to avoiding what your talking about. Not having a Dig at you btw, maybe Im just missing your opinion on the point.","replies":[]}]}
