Apparently this season I now have 30 wins and 83 loses and am placed in bronze 4. All my friends list deleted, skin shards dusted, rp spent. \r\n\r\nChanged my password now, but still this sucks.\r\nGoing to be fun if I want to get back to gold again...\r\n\r\nDidn&#039;t receive any emails from riots saying my account had been logged into from a different computer or anything like that, no password change or anything. Seems pretty lacking on their behalf.","replies":[{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2018-04-16T10:10:49.769+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"While the lack of two factor authentication isn't great, ultimately players have a degree of responsibility to keep their accounts secure as well. The usual stuff like not using the same passwords/usernames for things and so on (in saying that I'd recommend you change the password of your attached email account as well, since you presumably don't know how someone got a hold of your account in the first place).\n\nYou can submit a ticket to player support and they might be able to help you with your shards/RP and maybe your friends list as well (they can't help with rank) but that depends on a lot of things like the amount of time it's been, how the account was compromised etc.\nhttps://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/requests/new","replies":[]}]}
