As it stands, I can only remove people from my block list (its not even sorted so I cant find someone if I wanted to look for them). The block list location is clunky to get to and layout is bad for lists too. I don&#039;t even have the option to block someone in the endgame screen. Like really, do you even **THINK ABOUT FUNCTIONALITY** at all riot?\n\nEDIT: On the 6.23 patch notes under 'client' Riot says that performance is #1 objective. IMO functionality>performance (which is why I will continue to use the legacy client until the same level of functionality has returned.)","replies":[{"poster":"Corehog","date":"2016-11-22T08:13:30.723+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Right-click on the person in question on your friendlist and down the bottom is the 'Block' option","replies":[{"poster":"9knuckles9","date":"2016-11-22T08:18:27.565+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"what if they aren't on my friendlist?
