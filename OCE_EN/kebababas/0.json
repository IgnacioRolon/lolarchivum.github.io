The thing is like when 5 player choose same region champions, they got a team buff, and there enemy regions (like demacia and naxus) get another buff to against them, for example, when our side pick 5 demacia champions, we got a team buff decreasing 10% Dmg taken, and enemy side all choose naxus champions, they got a buff increasing 10% attack dmg and 10% more ap. And in later game , there will have a mission, like kazix and rengar one, it will make this game more relative to it&#039;s world, and more fun. That&#039;s all my opinions :) thank you ðŸ˜Š{{summoner:6}} {{summoner:6}} {{summoner:6}} {{summoner:31}}","replies":[{"poster":"Project Xayah","date":"2017-05-03T02:20:10.763+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thing is, this would seriously mess with game balance. There'd be no way for Riot to effectively manage all of that with all of the things they currently have to contend with (especially considering that they semi-regularly fall short on balancing as is).\n\nThis kind of thing would be best suited as a featured mode in the RGM queue, where it doesn't affect the standard play of the game (especially ranked/pro play).\n\nEDIT: And I believe the word you are looking for is \"Suggestion\" not \"Assumption\".","replies":[{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2017-05-03T07:47:17.204+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I agree a biff of some sort would be a bad move, but I see no reason you couldn't get a little IP boost or something :P It'd be a cool little nod to the lore, and wouldn't affect balance or gameplay choices.\n\nOr OR maybe they could have an emote (like the ones that go on your mastery key) with that region/factions sigil!
