Now today I get home from work, log into my account after my brother saying he couldn&#039;t log into his and what do you know hes online playing games. So I messaged the fella asking if he was there and what not, I got a reply straight away mind you my brother is sitting right next to me while all this is going down. So now this person starts spam posting my I.P address in the chat menu along with some other bs. So be careful people as there is some people going around stealing accounts. As for how they got the account info, I wouldn&#039;t have a clue at all. \r\n\r\nPeace yall","replies":[{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2018-04-10T08:07:22.552+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"If he hasn't already, your brother should submit an account recovery ticket to support ASAP:\n\nhttps://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/requests/new","replies":[]}]}
