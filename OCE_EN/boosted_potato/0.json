After about 10 minutes i calm down, and reconect. the game ends soon after. (With no prior warning from the leaver buster system) I get 20 minutes of lower prio. queue for 5 games.\r\n\r\nYes i understand the problem with leaving games in a matchmade or ranked enviorment, but seriously why should i get punished when playing with a full premade team of close friends?\r\n\r\nI understand i will have to &quot;do the time&quot; for my &quot;crime&quot; but the problem is that my friends and ppl i want to play with do not have the patience to wait 20 minutes every time we queue up for a game.\r\n\r\nRIOT. Intstead of making skins for the currently op chamions and then nerfing them 2 patches after to milk all the money you can out of it you should be adressing this.\r\nThis should decay, if not over a week or month, then a year or season. Or maybe over 100 or 500 games.

No one in the history of League has ever been punished for that. What you *do* get punished for is breaking the rules.\n\n> my friends and ppl i want to play with do not have the patience to wait 20 minutes every time we queue up for a game.\n\nGood! That's *exactly* how the system is supposed to work. You can't say this isn't seriously inconveniencing you and leading you to the decision to reform your behaviour so you don't end up in the same circumstances again, because that would obviously be a blatant lie.\n\n> Intstead of making skins for the currently op chamions and then nerfing them 2 patches after to milk all the money you can out of it you should be adressing this.\n\nWhy not both?\n\nSeriously, people need to f@cking learn that ***Riot f@cking does both!*** The teams that work on skins are ***completely and utterly separate*** from the player behaviour teams. Learn what the f@ck you are talking about before complaining!\n\n> This should decay, if not over a week or month, then a year or season. Or maybe over 100 or 500 games. I have probobly played 200-300 games since my last punishemnt.\n\nFun fact: It does decay! Isn't that great? It just doesn't decay over short periods of time.\n\nMaybe, just maybe, if you didn't consistently DC/AFK you wouldn't be getting hit with leaver punishments. Then again, what do I know?
