I wont post it here to be clicked on, but in the text of it read: &quot;leaguefolegends&quot; \r\nDidn&#039;t contain the word &quot;of&quot;. I&#039;d just like to try to make people aware of this. I don&#039;t know if the friend who sent me the link had his account stolen or not.\r\n\r\nJust everyone beware what you click and read everything carefully. I&#039;ve already searched for this online and have seen people reporting the loss of their or a friend&#039;s account.","replies":[{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2016-08-24T18:07:02.221+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thanks for bringing it up. More than likely your friend's account was compromised. If you know them outside the game I'd let the know, as it isn't always obvious to the player their account has been hacked. \n\nIf you don't, and you feel like being a good samaritan you could submit a support ticket explaining they sent you x link and you believe the account is compromised (just submit under general questions).\n\nOtherwise, thanks for being aware.","replies":[]}]}
