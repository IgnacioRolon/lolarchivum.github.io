There is some racism there (why does it matter if he's foreign or not, he's an ass plain and simple) but imo it would not be anywhere near enough to net you a punishment as a first offence and you should have persisted with an appeal. \n\nHe more than likely got chat restricted too. I don't know how long ago that was with regards to the introduction of the no tolerance policy that escalated that kind of chat to instant 14 day.\n\nIf players are telling you those things, and are still playing (not receiving 14 days) then frankly they shouldn't be, and you should be reporting those players through support (Tier 1 support is the customised macro, if you aren't satisfied just reply to the ticket).\n\nDefending yourself isn't the same as firing back. If you are partaking in the same behaviour, then you face the same punishments. Defending yourself is fine, retaliation is not.\n\n>explaining how to win a game isn't allowed. gaining elo isn't allowed. showing how much better you are than the people that represent your region isn't allowed. explaining yourself on boards isn't allowed....liking this game isn't allowed.\n\nAll of these things *are* allowed, it's how you go about them. Telling someone they're an idiot because they ignored your baron call is very different from explaining why you made the call. Expecting people to follow your lead and then lashing out at them when they don't is very different from giving them a reason to follow. \n\nBreaking the Boards rules is not the same as laying out your point of view. You are allowed to be pissed off, disgruntled and disillusioned. You are allowed to disagree with Riot or us or other players. It is when you cross the line into abuse or break any of the other rules that you are no longer explaining or discussing and moderation has a responsibility to shut things down.\n\nPermanent chat bans are not a thing for one main reason: They don't work. It only hides the behaviour and does not encourage reform, and chat restrictions are primarily warnings. There are some players that it may benefit certainly, but that number is miniscule compared to the players it wouldn't, it's not a scaleable compromise.\n\nIt sucks having toxic players in your game, but if their behaviour is so bad why do you deserve a free pass for the same? Why should the community tolerate people creating *more* toxicity just because 'someone else started it'. Why should the community allow grown ass players (M rated) to use a child's excuse for their behaviour? Consider your behaviour from the perspective of the positive and neutral players on your teams.\n\nIf you get hit for quoting someone else, appeal it. If you get punished for saying some bs in chat, own it. If you disagree with the rules the community has set, either realise you'll have to adhere to them to stay, or move onto another game.","replies":[]},{"poster":"GoSupportUrself","date":"2018-10-08T22:44:42.979+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":4,"body":"My friend had same situation as you.
