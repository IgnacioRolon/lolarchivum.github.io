Nothing amazing in the scheme of things, but something I noticed and have heard about regarding who you get placed with is that you get set up with people of same MMR rather than people of the same rank. I understand if your MMR is equal to your current rank you get more LP and all but, this can still prove to be rather frustrating when climbing. Ranked games should be against people of your own relative rank rather than MMR. \r\n\r\nI understand the new dynamic queue doesn&#039;t help in balancing out teams really, but still (And I assume the system tries to balance it out such as, Bronze V + Gold V = Silver V or something along those lines.). I see it as a problem if someone is trying to climb but you get paired with Silver people if you are in mid Bronze. You shouldn&#039;t be paired with people in Silver if MMR is the same. You should be paired with other mid Bronze. \r\n\r\nIs a bit of a rant, but I&#039;m wondering why this system is still in play when you should really be put up against people at your rank rather than according to your secret number.","replies":[]}
