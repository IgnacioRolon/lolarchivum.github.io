I specialize in mostly Tanky Crowd control champions, especially Sejuani, and also in fighters and assasins (Lee Sin and Rengar). I gank very regularly and when possible counter-gank whenever i can. My dragon control is very good and i rarely miss-smite. I have some experience as a shotcaller on my previous team and my map awareness is very strong. Im an experienced player (Season 2\n\nWeaknesses: I don't get angry at other players even if they are attacking me, but sometimes i can get annoyed and argue when it comes to certain gameplay elements. When not communicating via Voice coms (Teamspeak, Skype), my general communication is not as good. \n\nPrior Exp in a team: I have played in a diamond ranked team called Clockwork but was removed from their roster to make way for one of their close friends.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Hippyjew","date":"2016-01-04T14:31:54.174+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"IGN: Hippyjew\n\nAge: 23\n\nRank: Gold 3 (highest is G1)\n\nRole: Top/Mid preferred. Can play jungle and support quite solidly. Not a great ADC.\n\nStrengths: Motivated, wanting to learn and continue to improve in all roles and also as a team player. Map awareness has always been a strong point. Understand each champions abilities (on my own team and when I am against an opposing champion) and also aware of majority of general cool downs on skills (know when to go in and when not to, etc). Played the game since 2009/early 2010 so I have the knowledge behind me in terms of the fundamentals of the game. Understanding the correct counter picks and builds against individual opponents and overall opponents.\n\nWeaknesses: Not consistently warding as a support, not ganking pre-level 6 as a jungler (generally depends on the champ I am playing), split pushing at the wrong time (misreading play, thinking team will defend well without me/not get ambushed), generally get out-farmed as an ADC (rarely play ADC).\n\nPrior Exp in a team: Played in some tournaments with a team called Breakdown Gaming, biggest one was SGL in Sydney, coming 3rd to Fray and MindFreak I believe. I played top lane in this tournament. This was in 2012 mostly though. Otherwise no other team experience other than just mucking around.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Nightlord99","date":"2016-01-04T12:19:22.772+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"IGN: Nightlord99\nAge: 26\nRank: plat 5\nRole: Preferred Top\nStrengths: Strong teamfighting abilitys, know how to kill the adc, huge champion pool ( have all champs), easy to get along with and wanting to play quite seriously.\nWeaknesses: my Tp plays could use work i prefer to tp with communication, Defensive laner always outraded by stronger bruiser tops. \nPrior Exp in a team: Never anything serious just always solo que or teamed with people for normal's","replies":[]},{"poster":"Dandogable","date":"2016-01-04T09:02:22.863+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"IGN: Dandogable\nAge: 19\nRank: Plat 4\nRole: Jungle/top\nStrengths: Experienced shot caller, flexible time schedule, above average farmer, accurate with skill shots\nWeaknesses: Rare lag due to slow internet, slight tendency to flame if not listened to (told that people are ganking, but keep pushing and get killed), mostly confined to my home for gaming since I'm in the middle of the outback. \nPrior Exp in a team: Nothing professional, just ranked teams here and there for the past year.
