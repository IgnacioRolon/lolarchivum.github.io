I learn a lot by being punished in lane for lazy shit... Don't get that in Silver! xD \nLaning with a high elo support is always good too! They normally teach me a lot without even saying anything!\nI like having the direction in the mid/late game too... I'm normally fine to make when I'm in the right place, I just have trouble working out where the right place is! xD","replies":[{"poster":"DA Dawnfire","date":"2016-11-12T03:01:39.581+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Alright cool!

I'm going to be grinding the ranks myself this season to come, I haven't played much solo ranked, but I need to do it for myself xD\n\nBut we can be a good opponent, some of our players have been playing together for years, for example, our bot lane duo. \nMessage me on the client whenever you've managed to get a team, most likely, the best times for **Dark Vengeance** are weekends for scrims / tournaments. \n\nAlthough **Dark Angels** is the second team, we're about the same skill as a team. We are going to test that later today with a friendly scrim against each other, see how we go and see what we can improve on as teams. \n\nIGN: **DV Silent Resent**","replies":[{"poster":"Ruke23","date":"2016-11-13T09:03:09.172+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Sounds good guys, cheers!\nWe should have a team ready soon by the looks of things =)","replies":[{"poster":"DA Dawnfire","date":"2016-11-14T09:16:31.451+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"We were going to have a best of 3 scrim, however unfortunately our support was unavailable\n\nWe did get one match in with one of our sub players as support.
