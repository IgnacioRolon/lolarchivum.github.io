However at the moment I can&#039;t really think of any good reason why Sejuani would be picked over Amumu, I feel like Amumu just fits into team comps better with his more reliable ult. Sejuani mains halp.","replies":[{"poster":"Belrick","date":"2016-07-06T07:53:07.510+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"This split i mained Sej in the jungle. I played her because i loved her kit, she is a lot of fun and a beast in team fights. Trade off is she is a slow camp clearer and her early ganks are pretty damn weak.\n\nOverall she is not a great pick in the jg. So only play for fun.\n\nHowever on one note, her play is very similar to Gragas believe it or not. Mastery of Sej carries over to mastery of Gragas and gragas is a top tier JG.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Nijel","date":"2016-07-06T04:25:47.965+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Both are similar but I think Sejuani ends up better in a few ways. \n\n* Arctic Assault (Q) can be used as an initiation, repositioning tool and an escape, where as Amumu's Bandage Toss needs a target to be able to initiate or escape (and if someone cleared that jungle camp you ain't getting out).\n* Glacial Prison (R) doesn't put herself in danger when used. As a ranged ability it can also be used to set up plays or snipe a surprising distance away.\n* Even though the duration of Glacial Prison is shorter than Curse of the Sad Mummy, Permafrost (E) is a more immediate and widespread follow-up CC than a second Bandage Toss.\n\nDespite this, I still admit it comes down to personal preference and how coordinated you are with your team.","replies":[]},{"poster":"TheSingularity","date":"2016-07-06T02:22:08.904+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Amumu has a majority of his power linked to his ult. \nEven if u miss sej ult, she still has the CC and dps to make an impact. She also ends up far more beefy than amumu while remaining reasonably equal to him in damage output","replies":[]},{"poster":"JasonWazza","date":"2016-07-06T02:20:39.478+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The main difference, is if someone is out of range of your Q, your not forced to sit and wait or flash to hit it, and the ult is easier to position to hit more people because of it not being centered on you.\n\nI think it's mostly preference, because my preference is sejuani.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Lord Sesshomaru","date":"2016-07-05T23:33:15.650+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Ammumu is fucked atm, id be abusing that shit until the next patch or two when he gets nerfed (oh wait its RIOT calling the shots, nvm they wont nerf)","replies":[]},{"poster":"Roguestoney","date":"2016-07-05T23:02:39.196+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"My personal preference is Amumu over Sej.
