Pretty much ruins my chance at getting the position I want.\r\n\r\nI thought it was a connection issue, but it occurs when no one else is using the internet, and it occurs if I used my friends internet, and he joins the lobby instantly.\r\n\r\nGame runs fine as long as there aren&#039;t other people streaming.\r\n\r\nIs there any way to fix this ? Or at least find out why it&#039;s doing this ?\r\n\r\nOn a side note, I reposted this because I got the title pretty wrong. (I hope this isn&#039;t against the rules or anything)","replies":[]}
