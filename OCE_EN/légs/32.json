Any Rioter's available ?","subforum":"Gameplay & Strategy","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"So recently Senna was featured on the newest League of Legends roadmap, and beforehand my friend and I have been having a discussion on whether she will be purely supporting, or she will be a champion who can both play the ADC role and the Support role. \r\n\r\nIf you haven't read the roadmap for yourself, here is the link: https://nexus.leagueoflegends.com/en-au/2019/10/champion-roadmap-october-2019/\r\n\r\nTo quote from the actual champion roadmap;\r\n\r\n> When we were creating Senna, we knew she should be a marksman, but we also thought she should be able to lane with Lucian.\r\n\r\nThis more or less confirmed in my mind that she will be an ADC who can also be played Support, but my stubborn ass friend has an issue with the terminology used here. Because they used the word 'marksman' rather than ADC, he concluded that therefore there was no real evidence that Senna could be played bot lane as an ADC because \"champions like Pyke exist as an assassin but was made as a support and Senna could fall under the same category but as a marksman instead\"\r\n\r\nBefore I go insane with the amount of back and forth we had, I need some kind of confirmation from a rioter to settle this debate once and for all. Is she made to only be viable as a support ? Or can she be played as a bot lane ADC and a support at the same time.","replies":[{"poster":"Project Xayah","date":"2019-10-17T05:17:32.652+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"Just to preface, I'm not a Rioter, so take what I say as you will.\n\nThe distinction between \"Marksman\" and \"ADC\" is an important one to consider, the former being a role assigned by Riot with the latter being a term used by the community to identify a specific role within a team. While not common, there are marksmen in-game that don't fulfil the ADC position in it's traditional sense, primarily being Teemo and Azir. I think what is happening here is that Senna will be a marksmen designed around supporting, and as such wont fit particularly well with the ADC position, as it is traditionally.\n\nSo far as design wise, I think it's safe to say she's *not* an ADC. So far as how it's possible to use her, I'd imagine there could be some unique ways of adapting her to the ADC position.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Broken Scripts","date":"2019-10-17T19:10:12.291+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I assume she'll be like Miss Fortune and Ashe when they were played support.
