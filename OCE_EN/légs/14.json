Is there anything in that game that is significantly different to LoL that I should consider ? Do they even have top mid jg adc etc. etc.\r\n\r\nJust really curious. One of my friends said DOTA 2 is just overloaded with crap and alot of the heroes aren&#039;t balanced and he went on and on and on but he really only played Dota for a couple days.","replies":[{"poster":"Talon12","date":"2015-10-08T11:59:48.779+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"NO\nNO \nNO\nTHE CLARITY IN DOTA2 GAVE ME HEMMERAGE\n\nDRAGON KNIGHT SOUNDS OP, REALITY IS HE IS A PEICE OF (INSERT WORD HERE) THAT DOES (INSERT WORD HERE) NOTHING, DITTO THE OTHER (INSERT WORD HERE) 99% OF CHAMPS/HERO/WHATEVER ","replies":[{"poster":"Saturok","date":"2015-10-08T21:46:44.122+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Talon12,realm=OCE,application-id=Ntey9fRZ,discussion-id=fjqEWMEM,comment-id=0000,timestamp=2015-10-08T11:59:48.779+0000)\n>\n> NO\n> NO \n> NO\n> THE CLARITY IN DOTA2 GAVE ME HEMMERAGE\n> \n> DRAGON KNIGHT SOUNDS OP, REALITY IS HE IS A PEICE OF (INSERT WORD HERE) THAT DOES (INSERT WORD HERE) NOTHING, DITTO THE OTHER (INSERT WORD HERE) 99% OF CHAMPS/HERO/WHATEVER\n\nDragon Knight was used in the International  - he is not UP he is a niche pick who is actually pretty darn good.","replies":[{"poster":"Talon12","date":"2015-10-08T23:36:30.665+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"ALL THEIR PICKS ARE (INSERT WORD HERE)","replies":[{"poster":"Saturok","date":"2015-10-08T23:57:15.552+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Talon12,realm=OCE,application-id=Ntey9fRZ,discussion-id=fjqEWMEM,comment-id=000000000000,timestamp=2015-10-08T23:36:30.665+0000)\n>\n> ALL THEIR PICKS ARE (INSERT WORD HERE)\n\nI don't get it?","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Saturok","date":"2015-10-08T21:37:23.342+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey Mate\n\nYou are going to find quite a bit of general bias against Dota on these boards simply because its a competitor. \n\nI play League, Dota 2 & heroes of the storm. I like all of them for their own unique charm. I'll list out some of my personal pros & cons with Dota 2 but it's free so why not fire it up and give it a go yourself? \n\n**Pros**\n**Meta - **way more fresh options for team comp & lane distribution then league. WAY MORE. You can run tri-lanes, multiple types of heroes in the different lanes (Mid can be any type of hero basically and can be a duo or tri lane if you want). \n\n**Jungling -** Jungling is a lot more fun & is more involved then League (creep stacking, pulling etc) Depending on the overall strat of the game it's actually open to you whether you are going to roam, gank or just farm like mad getting that sweet sweet gold for a mid/late game advantage. \n\n**Champ Skills - **These are of a larger variety in Dota 2 and heroes aren't simply a recycle of similar abilities that was a mainstay in league for a long time. I say it was a past thing because some champs are starting to get released with some fresh ideas in the past 6 or so months. \n\n**Laning - **Laning is a little bit more involved due to the fact you have to manage your mana and creeps actually hit hard early game. \n\n**Community - **Like all multiplayer games and especially MOBAS their are elements of toxicity there. However in my experience I've found the community to be much more patient & forgiving then League. In the last 5 matches I've played of summoners rift, either my team or the enemy team have had at least one person wanting to surrender when someone gets first blood and then transform into a shit fight until the surrender vote finally gets its way. \n\n**Custom Games - **Dota 2's customs games are incredibly fun and varied. Want to play tower defense? Want to do a coop survival match? Want to see what its like to vs Insane difficulty AI? Want to play 10v10? Want to play pudge wars? it's all there. \nHeroes - all characters in the game are free \n\n**L00t - **You can get a large amount of free cosmetic items to the game just by playing matches (I won an entire set for a hero just a few days ago) \n\n**Items -** A large amount of the games balance is built into itemisation (which a lot of devs forget when looking at the design of heroes) and plays a huge part in the flow of the game. I list this as pro because it creates variety & creative builds and prevents the game getting stale. \n\nClient, replays & statistics - Dota 2 has the best client out of all the MOBAS since the current one they are using. Dota 2 also has a great replay & viewing system. Finally, your statistics in how you play (farming, roles etc) are all tracked put onto your profile for yourself and others to see. \n\n**Cons**\n**Difficulty -** Dota 2 is a very difficult to learn game. They have tried really hard to get around this by very comprehensive tutorials and coaching programs. The curve to get 'good' at the game however is still very steep and can be a trial by fire at the expense of team mates as you learn the game \n\n**Animations -** turning & last hitting on certain characters varies by a huge amount and can be frustrating to get the hang of. It can take a long time to learn individual character movements. \n\n**Game Design -** I still get mind blown sometimes when I see how long stuns last for in the game (among other things) a lot of this however is countered by good item building. \n\n**PUG problems -** Some really insane lane compositions or strats are EASILY countered in Dota 2. Unfortunately you are going to receive little to no help from most random matches. Up against KoL & Axe in a top lane and they've destroyed your second tower in 10 mins? Tough biscuits. Getting ganked non stopped by a stealth character in your own jungle? Too bad. I've had the same experience in League however.\n\n**Hero design problems -** If you vs competent enemies their are a handful of heroes that are absolutely easy just to shut off and make redundant through simple means including gems of true sight, wards & dust. All of these are relatively in-expensive vs the reward they bring. In terms of eSports Dota 2 also suffers from a similar problem that League has, with certain kits being so strong that they are picked every match. \n\n**Popularity -** Dota 2 is quite popular, but you are going to find the queue takes longer to pop then League. However, the connecting time & the loading of the game is far better done then LoL (again, due to the client). \n\n**Game Length - **Matches can drag on for FAR too long in my opinion. This has just been the evolution of this genre of game and  I think it's going to continue to move towards shorter matches in terms of what players & eSports viewers want. \n\n**The biggest con - **Techies are in the game. \n\nLike I said, I enjoy both games and I would really like more people to appreciate the aspects that they both bring to the industry. Heroes of the storm is also a fun MOBA and I encourage you to check it out. The only issue I've found with Heroes is the blizzard OP of the Month style balance.","replies":[]},{"poster":"VENI VIDI VICI","date":"2015-10-08T17:18:46.593+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"From what I saw when I played- it's basically you don't know what you're doing or whjy you're doing it.. Everything does something but really it means nothing. You can walk all over the map and it takes ages.  Some mages do spells which do nothing but then they throw balls at you from ages away and it wears you down. Yet you're an archer but you do as much damage as them with your auto attacks, except the mage somehow wins and you have to deal with it. Fuck dota. Random ass mages throwing auto attacks like an adc","replies":[]},{"poster":"DragonOfTheVoid","date":"2015-10-08T15:58:54.413+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"dota 2 is in my opinion shit I like to play hots aka heroes of the storm its a fun game try it if you wont here is a YouTube channel that is focuses on it \nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UCaIG92A013x_Cuv-yQOO7Hw its a way beter game then dota","replies":[]},{"poster":"GigaPube","date":"2015-10-08T13:51:44.950+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"unlike league, the gameplay aspect of dota 2 is totally free. everyone should try it, its a lot to download though, which is the only reason im not playing it, but if you can get around it its pretty similar to league but maybe its a bit more raw in that the controls arent as responsive as they feel on league","replies":[{"poster":"Zorphiax","date":"2015-10-08T15:12:06.612+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"League is the same DL time as Dota 2 if not more...\nBut there's an offline mode :O\nand bots are challenging as they do Roshan (Baron) and gank and listen to pings (is this Challenger in ranked League of Legends) :O\nDeath timers are longer graphics are better you can control more then 1 thing, If an ally disconnects you can control then and use there spells and all allies remaining slowly gain XP and gold faster but the dc loses gold over time, after a certain amount of time. sorry but compared Dota 2 to LoL, Dota 2 is way better, but I just don't have the skill for it at the moment.\n\n\"Does anyone here play DOTA 2?\"\nYes I do, but I'm not good at it.","replies":[]}]}]}
