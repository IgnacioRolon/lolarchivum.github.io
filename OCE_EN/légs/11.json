Id be  cool if more people were like ohno its tibbers ruuuuuuun\n\nEDIT: Just to clarify, yeah he kind of does play a role in terms of blocking skill shots and tanking tower hits, but this change was kind of more aimed at changing Tibbers identity in the game, further explanation in a reply I made below.","replies":[{"poster":"Olee","date":"2015-10-08T19:46:35.987+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Or how about you just delete Annie","replies":[{"poster":"Alamo","date":"2015-10-09T01:17:39.095+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Olee,realm=OCE,application-id=Ntey9fRZ,discussion-id=M0d2eFRP,comment-id=0004,timestamp=2015-10-08T19:46:35.987+0000)\n>\n> Or how about you just delete Annie\n\nthis seems like the obvious option","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"D0W0knu","date":"2015-10-09T08:02:56.775+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Or..\nOORR\nMake tibbers huge af with fire and lava drooling from his mouth whilst his auto is him flailing and biting at the enemy, who is running in fear of the large brown figure dismantling his limbs, bone, by bone...\n\n\"but I just wanted a hug!\"","replies":[{"poster":"Légs","date":"2015-10-09T13:23:23.306+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"LOL","replies":[{"poster":"D0W0knu","date":"2015-10-10T06:22:01.177+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Maybe even allow tibbers to be targeted by champion-only targets(as if it's a 6th champ) for extra mechanical play(and lulu ult)","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"TeCoolMage","date":"2015-10-08T10:25:52.409+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You underestimate Tibber's ability to tank anything from tower shots to skillshots.
