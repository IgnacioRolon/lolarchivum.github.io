Perhaps there is some kind of compromise?\n\n**TL;DR **Will Sona's voice be removed to fit the lore revamp or will she no longer be a mute?","replies":[{"poster":"Broken Scripts","date":"2018-04-21T08:55:51.818+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Riot's lore department is an utter mess.","replies":[]}]}
