Wrong. The lag was so bad I just had to leave, my character and everyone on my screen's movement and casting animation was very slow and then at unexpected times we would like teleport to where our characters would be if we were moving at a normal speed.\r\n\r\nNo one seemed to be having the same issue lol.\r\n\r\nThen I noticed my computer was like super duper slow as well e.g it took like 5 minutes to get to the log on screen and when I pressed the new tab button on google chrome the tab would move very slowly.\r\n\r\nBUT my internet, like how fast my search results came up fast for some reason.\r\n\r\nI scanned for a virus but it didn't detect anything. I did everything I found on the internet to clean hard drives like that disk cleanup thing and disk defragmenter deleting all the files from temp but it doesn't seem like it's doing anything.\r\n\r\nI'm in the middle of the repair thing you can do before you launch the game but I doubt it will work.\r\n\r\nSo I stopped playing league because I kinda gave up hope and I was wondering if anyone had any ideas on how to fix an issue like this :(","replies":[{"poster":"HORSE OF FORCE","date":"2015-01-24T23:55:36.574+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Have you reset your computer?","replies":[{"poster":"Légs","date":"2015-01-27T07:38:44.391+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=HORSE OF FORCE,realm=OCE,application-id=ElA0rvVL,discussion-id=9uj9BE3p,comment-id=0000,timestamp=2015-01-24T23:55:36.574+0000)\n>\n> Have you reset your computer?\n\nyeah, didnt fix anything :({{summoner:3}}","replies":[{"poster":"HORSE OF FORCE","date":"2015-01-27T10:59:38.422+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Do you maintain your computer, like, defrag and malware scans?","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Leowsly","date":"2015-01-27T07:48:05.987+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"bump","replies":[]},{"poster":"Leowsly","date":"2015-01-27T07:42:20.494+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"im having the exact same issue","replies":[]}]}
