Imagine that the ball is really the champ.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Djia","date":"2015-03-23T10:46:04.321+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I love Ori! By far the best champion in my books. Honestly, there are so many different ways to play her and use her in team compositions that you really should just play what suits the occasion. She's a great utility mid with a shield, slow, speed and displacement so you can play and build her for a team that needs a little bit of help surviving long fights. At full build she can clear whole minion waves with either q+w / q+e. Which makes her really good for pushing or holding turrets. She has great burst and can easily be the team carry. If you land a 3 -5 man ulti into Q you've pretty much won every team fight. I'm not a pro player or anything but I can definitely say that she is one of the most versatile champs out there :) I hope you enjoy learning how to play her!","replies":[]},{"poster":"Essy","date":"2015-03-23T10:25:20.444+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"she have a nice burst, the range of ur Q is decent and also u can control the team fight with ur Q and also able to turn the game around if u land a good R on the enemy backline","replies":[]},{"poster":"Grimzz","date":"2015-03-23T09:33:36.986+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"i added you IN GAME msg me","replies":[{"poster":"Légs","date":"2015-03-23T09:44:27.846+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Alright :p","replies":[]}]}]}
