Morellonomicon is much more cost-efficient and has other stats which are beneficial (mana regen and grievous wounds). LeBlanc needs items as soon as possible so even without the mana regen and grievous wounds Morellonomicon is better.","replies":[]},{"poster":"A steezy Scizor","date":"2016-03-20T11:02:01.210+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Gintamino Bay,realm=OCE,application-id=Ntey9fRZ,discussion-id=fPxRFjAX,comment-id=000100010000,timestamp=2016-03-20T08:35:48.403+0000)\n>\n> +80AP and 20% CDR, that is good in anyone's book.\n> \n> The AS and on hit is good as it does let her be more than a one hit wonder.
