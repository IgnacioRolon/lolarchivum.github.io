WARNING: SEMI BIG WALL OF TEXT INCOMING.\n\nTOP LANE: I hate to see {{champion:17}} {{champion:150}} {{champion:92}}. It's not so much fear, as it is annoyance, because I main {{champion:75}} and {{champion:122}} top, and seeing those champions means that I wont be able to farm or be aggressive, because they all have escapes or out trade my Q for damage.\n\nMID LANE: I loathe seeing {{champion:127}} {{champion:268}} {{champion:7}} {{champion:55}}. I like to play {{champion:103}} {{champion:157}} and {{champion:76}} mid. Lissandra takes a massive dump all over yasuo with her massive stun and burst, and does the same to ahri and nid. Azir I can never seem to get to as he's always behind his soldiers and that means taking a huge chunk of damage just to get into his face. Leblanc you can never touch, if she's a smart leblanc, and katarina has the highest burst damage in the game. If she roams and gets 1-2 kills, or if i %%%%up and die once, she will snowball into an unstoppable killing machine.\n\nBOT LANE: I don't normally play this very much, so i'll only show the champs i hate seeing here and not go into depth. I dislike seeing: {{champion:119}} {{champion:51}} {{champion:1}}.\n\nJUNGLE: If I see {{champion:421}} {{champion:64}} {{champion:102}} with smite, I pee myself a little. They all have lockdowns, dashes, knockups, CC whatever you wanna call it. They have \"you stop now, i kill you trololol\". Of course, I only play {{champion:19}} or {{champion:254}} in jungle, so i'm not scared of them when it comes to counterjungling, but if i'm in mid lane and I see one of those approaching, I've gotta hope i've got flash or i'm dead.","replies":[]},{"poster":"RLG Shaky","date":"2015-03-07T13:18:41.024+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"vladamir... this champ is just to over powered. amazing sustain in lane, no mana, spell vamp is ridiculous, that stupid pool... arrggggg hate that champ. the sustain is just to much come mid game when he has a spell vamp item :c\n{{champion:8}} {{champion:8}} {{champion:8}} {{champion:8}} {{champion:8}}","replies":[{"poster":"kJs","date":"2015-03-10T14:54:21.072+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Get {{item:3165}} if your AP and Executioner's Calling if you're AD, oh wait...","replies":[]},{"poster":"Chicken4dinner","date":"2015-03-08T14:02:46.195+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"don't forget laundry's torment with that...","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Holland","date":"2015-03-09T21:34:22.593+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"{{champion:114}}  She is scary when she ults there is no way to stop her only zhonha but only for ap though but far i hate her ulty!","replies":[]},{"poster":"I am Qwerty","date":"2015-03-09T09:00:10.883+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"As a {{champion:238}} main, I fear him the most, simply because I know his full potential and how much he can destroy games.
