Annie's E is far from useless compared to other abilities. It is absolutely fantastic for a short range mage like Annie. You can E before starting a trade to block minion damage and some auto-attack damage. I occasionally max it to 3 points before other abilities especially for this reason. And yeah, it adds a stack of her passive so it makes it much easier to get to 4 stacks. Also, when you use it with Tibbers out, Tibbers gets the shield. This means that you can make Tibbers walk up to a melee or ADC, and get him to attack them. They either take the burn damage, or fight, and lose health because of the shield. I have killed people with Annie's E due to it's damage late game. It's like a built in thornmail.\n\nSaying Annie's E is useless is like saying Ashe's E is useless. Sure it's not exactly impactful on the game itself, but it provides great vision and can save your butt, or even provide a set up for your ult. If you wanna talk useless abilities, Rengar's standard W is a pretty good example. It's damage is not high enough to be considered a damage ability, and why would you need an MR and armor buff on a stealthy assassin? Your not tanking these days, and the only thing it really does is add a stack of Ferocity, but you don't need that, because you only really use Ferocity stacks in and after you ult, or in the jungle. \n\nThat been said some abilities may seem simple or even un-impactful but are specifically designed to set up or are good in the right situations, which doesn't implement play style to the champion, but instead adds some sauce on the top to them.","replies":[{"poster":"EzeBlood","date":"2016-05-01T01:30:13.119+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Rengorax,realm=OCE,application-id=Ntey9fRZ,discussion-id=ictNMlWG,comment-id=0001,timestamp=2016-04-16T04:58:59.936+0000)It is absolutely fantastic for a short range mage like Annie.\nDude Annie has the longest aa range in the game.

Annie's E is far from useless compared to other abilities.\nomg are you saying her e is more useful THAN ALL HER OTHER ABILITIES.\n\n\nBefore I start I apologise for using the term 'useless' which clearly isn't the correct word, but I'm still not convinced Annie's E is a great spell.\n\nFirstly just because her e can block a bit of minion damage doesn't make it an great spell. Id rather have a spell that can save me from ganks like ahri's charm or katarina's e than something that can reduce minion damage. Most of the time you have already used your E anyway to get a stack of your passive, at least that's what I see in many Annie players.\n\nI've already address the whole 'yea her e can add a stack of her passive' but so can literally any other spell if she was given one. It doesn't say much about the spell itself, its simply just helps the passive come into action.\n\nI SERIOUSLY doubt you killed someone just with your e and tibbers bear damage. Sure you can make tibbers walk up to someone and attack them, but you can avoid him pretty easily by just walking away. Besides, you can buy bloodthirster or something and make the active useless anyway. There are only very uncommon situations where her E is extremely useful in the mid to late game, which is why I don't like it in the first place.\n\nand finally\n\n> Saying Annie's E is useless is like saying Ashe's E is useless. Sure it's not exactly impactful on the game itself, but it provides great vision and can save your butt, or even provide a set up for your ult.\n\nHow on earth is this a good analogy. You literally just said Ashe's E isn't impactful on the game itself yet you say it provides great vision, and can save your life and set up a good ultimate. Not to mention you can check important objectives from base. How is this comparable to a mini thornmail that lasts like 5 seconds.\n\nFinally, as you know Riot is working on Annie in the mid year Mage update, and one of the things they want to see come out of the mage update is;\n\"Molten Shield should have value as a powerful defensive ability on a mage; especially one that’s often bear-dropping into the thick of battle.\"\nEven the people who created annie don't think her E is as good as it could be right now, otherwise they would bother reworking the ability in the first place.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"EzeBlood","date":"2016-05-01T01:25:27.991+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Sion's Shield.
