Just completely cut them out. So don't even say things like \"they're just salty don't listen to them\". just congratulate the poor innocent soul in question for good plays and encourage them after bad ones. \n\nDon't acknowledge anything the offender says and they'll usually get bored and stop eventually. If they don't well at least the poor innocent soul has a bit of a barrier between them and the toxicity. Negativity tends to stick out more than positivity, and you can't get so into it you get distracted from the game, but even just a \"nice work!\" every now and again can do wonders.","replies":[]}]}
