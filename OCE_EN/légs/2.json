I love Diana's attitude and her awkward humour, Rek'sai...well I love the xenomorphs (visually anyway :P) and she has a cool backstory, and Shyvana cause she's a half dragon and that's just damn cool.\n\nNow fav lore...that's a real hard one. I'd have to go with Kindred/Aurelion. I love Kindred's mysticism and directness and Aurelion's arrogance and hubris, and their lore really captures that. They also have my fav VOs in the game.
