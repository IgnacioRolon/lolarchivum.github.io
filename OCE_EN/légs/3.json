Gives you enough time to try out everyone you wanted to whilst not getting bored. Taric is really bad and not as good as I thought he would be. Probably the worst URF champion this time round. As for Zed, still really strong, and probably better than last year.\n\nI'm going to format this into sections for you:\n\nBEST 2016 URF CHAMPION:\nJax\n\nJax is super overpowered this year, no joke I got a triple kill before minions were in lane. His minimal cooldown jump combined with his auto attack block and a W every 2 attacks really hammers out damage when he is hybrid.\n\nWORST 2016 URF CHAMPION:\nTaric\n\nThe Taric rework is really lackluster to what you would think. Even as AP your E doesn't do any damage, and the stun is hard to hit so spamming it anyway. Your Q heal is weak compared to others, and your ultimate isn't that great. Honestly just discount Sona.\n\nFUNNEST 2016 URF CHAMPION:\nGraves\n\nGraves is really good with his rework, the low cooldown ultimate and the 2 second E when you attacks just blows others out of the water. You just W and E over a wall, take out two guys with your tanky damage build and your Q + crits, then ult them, get a double kill and get pushed back over the wall. Pool Party skin increases fun factor.\n\nMOST ANNOYING 2016 URF CHAMPION:\nFiora\n\nIt was a tie between a few others really but in the majority of games Fiora just doesn't stop blocking CC and healing, ulting and Qing.\n\nSTRENGTH OF THE CLASSICS:\n\n1. Katarina\n\nKatarina is really good this year, mostly because everytime you get a kill your ultimate resets fully, it is so easy to get 1v5 pentas, and your base abilities make even your early game strong.\n\n2. Akali\n\nAkali can be alright but over all she should just stick to ranked games this weekend, not that great.\n\n3. Alistar\n\nStill the same cow. His WQ combo and the constant healing, combined with perma tank nearly, just honestly grinds your gears playing against him.\n\n4. Hecacopter\n\nHecarim is sadly not OP this year. No one is banning him, and for good reason. The ones that do play him, always end up feeding, as much as they may fly away.\n\n5. Evelynn\n\nLet's put it simple, if I didn't pick Jax for the best champion, I would put Evelynn. So OP.\n\n6. Fizz\n\nPress E.\n\nCHAMPION WITH MOST OUTPLAY POTENTIAL IN URF 2016:\n\nTie between two champions.\n\nThe first is Zed. When you play Zed in URF you suddenly feel like Faker with your shadow placement, even though it's probably just spamming doing the work. I can't count how many 1v4 Quadra kills I have gotten when I just W in and ult, spam E and Q a bunch of times and demolish them.\n\nThe second will sound like a joke, but you must believe me. Urgot. I go into a team of 3, ult one of them out, E them all, then spam Q on a 0.2 second cooldown. PEW PEW PEW. Then I just keep chaining it until they are all running. But I don't stop there. Oh no. Instead I spam my Q as they desperately try to escape my lock on zone. BAHAHAHA!\n\nAnd there were no real bugs this year, except {{champion:121}} \n\nDUM DUM, CRASH!\n\nBut seriously he really is good this year, thanks to his E and Q. (His Q is on a 0.6 second cooldown 0_0)\n\nSo that's about it so far. I shall edit if I have anything further to say.\n\nOh and btw, you are really missing out lmao.\n\n-Rengo","replies":[{"poster":"Main Line","date":"2016-04-24T17:39:15.555+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Rengorax,realm=OCE,application-id=Ntey9fRZ,discussion-id=btBeoRr3,comment-id=0001,timestamp=2016-04-24T13:57:12.661+0000)\n> BEST 2016 URF CHAMPION:\n> Jax\n\nNah, Sona's the best, followed by Galio.
