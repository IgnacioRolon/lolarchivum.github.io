If I had to pick out a single story arc as my favourite, it would have to be the Underworld arc (second half of season 5). I really think that Greg Germann killed it as Hades, and I liked seeing a bit of a deviation from the \"typical\" villains of the series. Only thing is that the new season is a bit iffy, and, while I can't say for sure at the moment, it might have been better to leave it at the end of season 6.","replies":[{"poster":"Essembie","date":"2017-11-25T08:04:07.007+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=HeartVine,realm=OCE,application-id=Ntey9fRZ,discussion-id=K3Gn6X0f,comment-id=000200000000,timestamp=2017-11-24T23:30:08.075+0000)\n>\n> Trust me, it gets better.\n> \n> Like season 1 is nice and all, but when you really get down to it most of what season 1 is is about is setting up the rest of the series, and there&#x27;s so much to see and enjoy.
