You can make mistakes and still get away with it.  Vayne is mechanically hard but rewarding if your support always peels for you.\n\nBut cassiopeia, she is a monster. It's fairly hard to kite with Cassiopeia, but with enough practice you can 1 v 1 almost anyone. She is a late game hyper carry (like vayne) that doesn't exactly need babysitting (but can be bursted down if caught out). Her ult is a tad hard to effectively land and has a weird hitbox (however, it can make or break a team fight and is greate for initiating, engaging, re-engaging and disengaging)\n\n In short, Cassiopeia works well with any team comp (especially people who can initiate and disengage well) and she is also considered as the \"vayne of mid laners\". Play smart and jesus, you can deny farm, exp to your enemy mid laner and make them cry.\n\nAdd me in game if you want to learn Cassiopeia! I main her in ranked! Can give you a few pointers here and there :D","replies":[{"poster":"Légs","date":"2015-09-15T14:10:56.187+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Sweeeet.

Cass can deal insane burst damage is has an extremely useful ult that can turn a team fight in your favour. Vayne has high dps and great kiting potential. With proper positioning you can perform really well in team fights. I personally prefer Vayne over Cass out of these two because of the play potential of Vayne over Cass. But that's my own opinion.","replies":[]},{"poster":"BarryButcher","date":"2015-09-12T16:25:11.565+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Vayne hands down the most fun. Probably one of the most fun champs in the game.\n\nCass is fun to play every so often, but she can be punished really hard because she is so immobile. Has probably one of the strongest level 2's in the game and can all-in almost anyone if you take ignite and hit level 2 first.\n\nBut I prefer Vayne between the 2.","replies":[]}]}
