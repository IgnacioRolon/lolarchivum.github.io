Today we were in a Skype call, he hung up and starting complaining about how he feels like shit and how everyone else is better than him etc etc.\n\nI thought maybe if he just kept playing eventually he would get better but honestly his patience is running out and I KNOW that if he kept pushing he could get better but his self esteem is kind of too low for him to keep going. \n\nRight now I just throw out tips and recommend champions but is there anything else I could do to at least help him realise he isn&#039;t the worst.\n\nEDIT: I'll just put it out there that the other friend doing well with Katarina actually gets him a bit angry that he doesn't really get to find his champion and it's starting to get awkward lol.","replies":[{"poster":"Soulhavok","date":"2015-09-13T08:56:41.079+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Howdy.  \n\nThe way I was taught was by watching the pros on you tube play and listening to their tips and advice.\n\nOne of them said to practice last hitting is to starta custom game v bots only and you focus only on a cs score.  So for example you play any champion you like and go mid Lane and you don't even touch the enemy. You goal is to have ad much cs after 10 minutes. You also don't buy items.  This gets you used to last hitting along with dodging basic spells. \n\nAnother thing to do is dual him and get him used to person in a custom game. Champion wise all the champs are easy to some but hard to others. His best deal is to play as many champs as he can and then settle on the ones he likes the look and feel of. \n\nLeague of legends takes months and years to get used to as it changes every patch.  He cannot expect to bea master after a few months. It does not happen. \nNeeds to be patient and not play like world depends on it. This is what makes toxic players.","replies":[{"poster":"Légs","date":"2015-09-15T14:06:51.285+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Well {{champion:266}} just went free to play this week and he LOOVES him, everything about him, and he seems to be more excited about the game all of the sudden.\n\nSo I guess I should just sit here and watch him blossom ?\n\nThanks for those other ideas though, i'll try them.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"demonicslothman","date":"2015-09-12T14:15:33.974+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"i had the same problem he was having when i first started, i was soo close to just stopping as it just wasn't worth it but i kept playing cuz my friends were so i played as well mind you this was around the {{champion:21}} release for anyone that knows that time period there wasn't a meta and skill just wasn't a thing. but i watched some of the pro players games and picked up a few tips and tricks and learning how see the game in different ways and this was at the beginning of season 2 and i saw my level of play pick up after watching them for a while and just putting into practice for me this was learning the support role which i love and for the longest time mained {{champion:10}} in that role which I still play today and still love it. \n\nbut my advise is to let him have a break from the game for a week or 2 and then get him to play some more if you have a few buddies try playing 2v2 customs which is what my friends and i do to learn new champs try different builds and have fun with out the pressure of winning or losing (I'll just add that we have a rule when we play not to attack towers or inhibs/nexus. makes the game go too fast if one side has a better player or a better champion match up and player skill levels which is a big problem for my mates and I) \n\nI hope this helps a little. Just don't force him to play a lot at once do a best of 3 or 5 when you guys play for instance so if you win 2 games then lose 3 just call it a day  or leave it a few hours to cool off and play another game play another game","replies":[{"poster":"Légs","date":"2015-09-15T14:14:56.176+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thaanks :)","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"DW GunGale","date":"2015-09-12T13:55:00.048+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Firstly. Work on bringing his enjoyment of the game back into it. Maybe introduce him to a couple of the different game modes and maybe even some of the misc games like dodge ball or hide n seek. Then bring him back into a proper game and work on his mechanics.

Have some fun with him, play some ARAM, teach him how to lose graciously, and teach him how to dodge skillshots. Seriously, there's no better feeling than to walk out of a predicted Blitz/Thresh Q with no vision in an early level 1 invade, then walk back in and taunt (Idk if many people do this, I'm weird like that).\nSeriously have some fun, ARAM is great, because if he's new, nobody his level would really know how to play their champions. It's also fun because it's not so serious. After he brightens up to the game, maybe start teaching him how to last hit, but keep his interest up.\n\nA great way of keeping him interested, and maybe even teach him a few tips, is to watch LCS at play, get him to subscribe to the League Esports YouTube channel https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCvqRdlKsE5Q8mf8YXbdIJLw and watch their videos (they have hundreds released every week, it's crazy) \nGood luck! :)","replies":[]},{"poster":"Légs","date":"2015-09-12T13:08:58.918+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Was also wondering if he could try out {{champion:5}}, dunno if its a beginner friendly champion because I literally haven't played him yet","replies":[]},{"poster":"Freyä","date":"2015-09-12T13:01:56.105+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"***","replies":[{"poster":"Légs","date":"2015-09-12T13:07:48.392+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hmm.\n\nARAM was actually the day he 'cracked' and starting swearing and stuff, could give it another chance.\n\nHowever we did play Twisted Treeline once and he absolutely loved that so..","replies":[]}]}]}
