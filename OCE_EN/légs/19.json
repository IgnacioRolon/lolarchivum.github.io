It might probably be, I mean it seems right in my head, but it would be nice if I were to hear some of your thoughts about this.\r\n\r\nAnyways lets get on with my issue.\r\n\r\nI&#039;ll try and make this as simple as possible, but I do get carried away alot.\r\n\r\nLet&#039;s start off with this program that I&#039;m pretty sure is a pain for alot of gamers out there right now.\r\nN E T F L I X.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately I have 2 sisters and a cousin, all in uni.\r\nBefore NETFLIX, They downloaded alot of TV shows and just binged watched all the time. Like seriously, they be waking me up at 1:00am with their stupid screaming about some death in Game of Thrones or a guy going after a girl or something.\r\n\r\nBut with Netflix, you stream. Which means watching the show makes the internet slow. And movies be going on for like  1 - 3 hours, whereas their episodes go for like 1 hour. And binge watching.\r\n\r\nI could probably make a long list of every show they watch over again but cant be bothered.\r\n\r\nAnyhow this left me frustrated as I could no longer play as much as I used to, and I began to drift apart from the close friends I had back in league, but it had never occured to me that I would never have to say goodbye to League. Not until like a year after my dad gets netflix. Not until this night.\r\n\r\nI promise I won&#039;t lie to you all, but there is LITERALLY not a single time I can play when those girls be awake. It might not be netflix, maybe its because everyone is using the internet at the same time, however I realised that I could no longer play league during the day. Not on weekdays, not on weekends, not ever.\r\n\r\nIt actually didn&#039;t make as much of an effect as you might think, as my parents left the internet ON at night, I had the opportunity to have all nighters during friday and saturday to play league, and thats all the satisfaction I really need. Sure it makes me sleep deprived during the day, but who cares. Theres nothing to do during the day, all I do is sleep anyway. Although is probably bad for your body for some reason I don&#039;t know of yet. \r\n\r\nBut this night, my mother decided to confiscate my computer each night to avoid me staying up. (eyebags). And then the pain hit me. I quickly realised there was no way I could ever play this game again. Not with 2000 ping each game, I still had hope, I don&#039;t let go so easily.\r\n\r\nI talked to my parents and my sisters about this Netflix issue, but unfortunately they just get mad at me. Especially my mom. shes like&quot; IS VIDEO GAMES IMPORTANT ? IS WHAT YOUR DOING SO IMPORTANT ? DO YOU REALLY THINK WE CARE ?&quot; Yeah she shouts.\r\n\r\nI might have to just find some downloadable game and stick to that but..\r\nI&#039;ve saved and spent alot of money on this game, and imo it was worth every penny. but most importantly, I&#039;ve met some of the most amazing people on this site. Friends that I&#039;ve seriously grown so attatched to we would share some of our deepest darkest secrets together and laugh about it. I loved playing with those guys. In my opinion, if it werent for the awesome people, I would of quit a long time ago.\r\n\r\nThis whole thing just made me a sadder person overall. I get woken up during the day and slapped across the face, because I&#039;m &#039;faking my sleep&#039; and using up all the internet, and League was the perfect escape from the hell that is high school. Having my little geeky group about league in high school and talking about league all the time was the only thing that was holding my morale up, and now, now that I&#039;m probably going to be ignored during convosations or whatever, or the fact I might lose the connections I had with my friends in league, and more importantly, my love for the game and the champions, (love you ahri ;). I fear my self esteem might pummel to the ground again.\r\n\r\nI take a look back now and ever since Ive been betrayed by my bestest friend in primary, online games where I could interact with others is really all that held me together. With this netflix issue, I can&#039;t really have that anymore, and I don&#039;t know what to do. I&#039;ve tried so hard to convince my parents that I might feel depressed or whatever if this thing goes on, but they won&#039;t listen. They don&#039;t care.\r\n\r\nTo conclude, to all you summoners who get to play League, consider your self lucky. We should all just be appreciative that this game is free and all imo. It&#039;s a really awesome game. and I miss it so much.\r\n\r\nP.S Can people stop being so goddamn rude to Riot whenever they might accidently screw up or something. All they want to do is make the game more enjoyable for us, I mean thats what all the updates are for right. When the new HUD got released it broke my heart to see all thes people call riot stupid, or idiotic or whatever awful thing they had to say. Honestly I really wonder how riot staff feel when they see things like this. It breaks my heart to think about it. Can we just keep all the hate and the rank to yourself and just give them feedback for god sakes. They would probably listen to you if you did anyway.\r\n\r\nIt&#039;s a free game after all.","replies":[{"poster":"Fitzky","date":"2015-08-16T10:12:03.330+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I feel you man, with 4 other siblings ITS HELL, I even forget what 35 ping looks like sometimes....","replies":[]},{"poster":"0j0j0","date":"2015-08-14T23:11:24.780+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Well said in the PS section Brother","replies":[]}]}
