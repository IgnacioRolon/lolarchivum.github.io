My ping slowly gets worse and worse until I literally can&#039;t move my character any more, minions were moving and the other players were free to kill me but I was just standing there.\n\nI&#039;ve tried playing other games but they seem to be working fine, I even have a program with this feature that allows me to keep track of my ping all the time and it seems to be 27-30, even though in League it was at 1000.\n\nI use Optus by the way.\n\nEDIT: Fixed. The program I used to track my ping was called csfospeed uses traffic shaping. I read somewhere that traffic shaping is a big red flag so I uninstalled it, and my ping was fine !","replies":[{"poster":"Mindstar","date":"2015-07-08T00:57:33.459+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey Jencarna,\n\nThis does sound pretty strange indeed.  1000 ping is very high.
