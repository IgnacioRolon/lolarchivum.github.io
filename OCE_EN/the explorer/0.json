Now I haven&#039;t gotten one in weeks? Just wondering if anyone has the same problem or if something is wrong with my account.","replies":[{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2018-05-13T05:18:37.535+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You're at least honour level 3? If you're still H2 you won't get flairs. As for key fragments, in the old system the drop rate would slowly lower before resetting each month (from when you first earned your key, not from a particular date), I believe there is something similar in the new system.","replies":[]}]}
