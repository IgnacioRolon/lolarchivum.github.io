How many Conquest games have you played in that went pear shaped faster than a banana dying in the Australian sun?\n\nNow how many TT games have you had that were just not worth the effort? On both the winning and losing side you get those games that are just pointless to play. Maybe with the introduction of bans first to see if that makes any difference to the games quality,\n\nBut I just think that with how TT games currently pan out there is no point. It is too easy to get 3 players together to troll the enemy and win with ease making the ladder completely lopsided.","replies":[]}]}
