It was suggested that perhaps more non-casters (players/coaches etc) on the desk would be nice. Initially it was suggested to go from 2 Casters/1 Guest to 1 and 2 respectively and later suggested to just add one person and keep the two casters there.\r\n\r\nThe response was, as I understand it - is there any information that 2+1 guest is not offering that 2 guests would? In particular it was said that &quot;i&#039;m more interested in information not who says it&quot;.\r\n\r\nI don&#039;t think there&#039;s any issue with the quality or quantity of analysis from the desk as it stands. I don&#039;t think adding a second guest would add any in-game analysis that the current desk format is missing. I think, however, there&#039;s scope to look into adding a second guest for situations that might have those that ARE interested equally in who is providing the content as to what they&#039;re saying. Whether it&#039;s a marquee matchup or a race for a finals spot. It doesn&#039;t need to be permanent, there&#039;s probably not airtime to spare to get four whole opinions in week in, week out on multiple games anyway.\r\n\r\nOf course, i&#039;m sure that at least part of the reason that guests were brought in was to help connect new esports fans to teams that they can identify with as more than just a screen name - but if the team has the capacity to add a second guest, and if the situation could call for it, why _wouldn&#039;t_ you add another to help aid that benefit? Also if you can get a coach and a player, then you can dissect plays from multiple perspectives, all from the standpoint of people who are actually doing these things in their own matches. For as good as the current casters are at breaking plays down, it just takes us one step closer to being there to hear it from the guests. For instance, something like Minky + Destiny or Minky + Ryoo for tonight&#039;s game would be awesome. It covers coach + player, as well as has the intrigue of representing both a team that the current teams are chasing, and in turn a team chasing them. It deepens the narrative that can be told from the desk - this game is often more than just &quot;Welcome to Summoners Rift&quot; through to Nexus explosion and as a TV-like broadcast, a second guest would provide a richer experience.\r\n\r\nTLDR the advantages I see to adding a second guest are:\r\nCan add hype to bigger matchups\r\nAllows a variety of personal perspectives on the in-match analysis (ie coach + player)\r\nCan broaden the out-of-match context or narrative with a broader diversity of opinions.\r\n\r\nNow, again, I don&#039;t think the current desk format is _incapable _of providing the information that i&#039;m referring to, but I think it would deepen the viewing experience to have it come from a variety of contexts and experiences. I love hearing what Atlus, Rusty, Spawn, The artist formerly known as Spawn&#039;s Beard and Pastrytime have to say, and I feel like I would love even more to have, even it&#039;s just from time to time, two extra voices with them instead of just one.","replies":[{"poster":"SpawnTheCaster","date":"2016-02-10T22:55:51.051+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey Plubby,\n\nThanks for posting this. To clarify we arent against double guests, and in fact may use this in the future. However, what I was trying to ask is why people wanted that. For example if its because people like analytical desks maybe even without the player we should head in that direction. If its to experience personalities maybe they want more variety. \n\nI agree that having guests is great for OCE and I cant wait for more pros to be on, its just a huge time commitment for alot of them, and it can also at times be daunting. Being on camera is actually something I really struggled with and at times you can even tell still (voice wavers / spider hands / hotpotato) and we are trying to make the experience a net positive for everyone.\n\nThanks for your input and I may even tweet this out and kick the conversation off as I have some time today.\n\nCheers.","replies":[{"poster":"Revoke","date":"2016-02-11T01:58:39.954+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I was trying not to portray you guys as against the idea of 2 guests, more the reasoning behind it 'cos I noted yourself and Rusty in particular were very careful not to word it like that on twitter.\n\nAlso, funnily enough, I used Minky as the coach in both of my examples cos I saw you say that Jish wouldn't ever be on.

There's no negative IMO in doing such.\nMystery reveal generates interest, curiosity as to who it may be and a form of hype.\n\nWe are always looking for feedback so thankyou for the entire post, as usual we want the best for you guys, \nI think the tl;dr can be that if the guest is new or special we could look to do a secret reveal, if the guest is a local or more than one timer, perhaps even a public outcry guest.. We could happily announce it!","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"chhopsky","date":"2016-02-10T23:28:21.017+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I was against the double-guest scenario at first, but after consideration I've decided it might actually be a good thing, for one reason.\n\nTo a certain extent, Riot casters and analysts have to be fairly neutral in their analysis.  Criticism comes where criticism is due, and it's good, but overall you guys have to remain Switzerland.  When a guest comes on the show, they get to say their piece and whatever, and can be much more divisive and express stronger and less popular opinions than yourselves.  Secondary to that, there's also a certain limit to which you can counter it.  Having two guests would give a little more freedom for rebuttal when a guest has an unusual opinion.  We see this more when people are on a desk together who don't normally present with each other, and knowing there's not an ongoing show to present involving both guests could produce a more in-depth dig-through of the issues at play.\n\nOne thing I've found at Twitch is that our streams /always/ play better when we have two guests.  That said, your show is very different to ours, but perhaps the same concept might apply?  Just some out-loud thoughts from your friendly neighborhood pixel miner.\n\n{{champion:150}}","replies":[{"poster":"SpawnTheCaster","date":"2016-02-10T23:43:43.829+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey Chhopsky\n\nfirstly thanks for jumping in. I do want to say I agree we are too neutral, but overall we DONT want to be. Be neutral during a cast say your opinion on the desk. I think Frosk did this really well so shout our to her. I also want the \"caster\" and \"player\" to be able to disagree, for example when i said did the split push really fail (HLN game this week) Carbon said yes it did it was bad. This is great I love those moments.\n\nI agree that it may increase the depth of the conversation and that is something that does excite me.\n\nCheers,","replies":[{"poster":"chhopsky","date":"2016-02-11T06:49:50.055+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"As I said to Benji on Twitter, Frosk is a literal god on the desk.  She present an ultra-analytical point of view, and combined with the in-depth knowledge that you guys provide of the teams and the players, between all of you there's an incredibly powerful desk team comp.\n\nCarbon brings a great dynamic to the desk and I enjoy his guest slots more than any other player.  As he becomes more comfortable he's expanding his vocabulary and it brings a great view from the front lines as a current player.\n\nBenji's willingness to pivot and change directions to get the most improvement out of the show is commendable.  Keep up the good work boys and girl, I miss 3 hours of sleep a night for this! \n\nI, for one, am impressed at the developments.  \n\nAnd the puppets.\n\n{{champion:150}}","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Syuko","date":"2016-02-11T02:33:09.734+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"***","replies":[{"poster":"SpawnTheCaster","date":"2016-02-11T02:34:39.370+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Who are you sorry?!","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Smite","date":"2016-02-11T06:16:58.673+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Personally I'm loving the Twitter interaction you guys have going on and not even just because I got to be the first one of the season. Maybe occasionally head it in the direction of viewers asking questions rather than giving their opinions, particularly when you have players as guests on the show.\n\nFor example asking us to tweet questions for Carbon to answer. The questions could have a specific theme, such as jungling at a professional level or just left wide open like where he stands in the #spawnbearddebate.\n\nIn any case please keep featuring tweets on the show!\n\n{{summoner:11}} {{summoner:11}} {{summoner:11}}","replies":[{"poster":"littlemisscheeky","date":"2016-02-22T09:15:49.833+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"This is happening on Tuesday night's OPL broadcast based on your feedback :)\n--> https://twitter.com/LOL_Oceania/status/701693628167516160","replies":[]},{"poster":"littlemisscheeky","date":"2016-02-12T03:55:00.629+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thanks for the feedback around this Smite :)\n\nIt excites me that you guys are enjoying the increased social media & broadcast integration.\n\nWe tried questions to the shoutcasters last year and can look to re-visit it with the inclusion of the guests.","replies":[]}]}]}
