You would have to be a lot more descriptive on how the mechanics of his skills would work, so people can get a better idea of what you meant. His E - \"Shielding an ally\" is this only for allies or can it be self-cast? Passive - \"fraction of this bonus to surrounding allies\" how large would the aura be, how much would this \"fraction\" be, would it be applied before or after some effects *masteries % armour bonus*. It's nice there's still people thinking about taric, i use to play him support all the time, sometimes top, running full armour runes with full defensive masteries (5% cdr from offensive), having 100 armour at level 1 is always fun. {{champion:44}} {{item:1029}}","replies":[{"poster":"Ritual","date":"2015-05-13T10:41:37.121+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"ok nerf.. remove root from w just a little armour he already has that passive anyway but he loses it when poking","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Jezmae","date":"2015-05-13T08:07:24.538+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"why not e just flat heal instead of left over shield turns to heal?
