If you are getting deleted by an assassin, swap that BORK for a Bloodthirster. Swap essence reaver for Frozen mallet.

Their CD's are either relatively low or they are auto-attacked/lifesteal focussed.\n\nZhonya's Hourglass - Made for AP champions because whilst they're as squishy, if not squishier than AD champions, they need that few second timeout to clear their CDs.\n\nBasically these two items are like brothers. The other way around might be a bit pointless because they technically do the same thing overall. If an adc zhonya'd they'd need spells or instant sustain to bring themselves back up afterwards or kill the enemy instantly.","replies":[]}]}
