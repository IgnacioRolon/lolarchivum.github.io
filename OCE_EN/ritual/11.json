Also new players may just say \"she is a support with no dmg\" which causes me to get enraged and extremely excited since at times i go 30/10 and shock the enemy team.","replies":[{"poster":"Lilja","date":"2015-07-30T02:35:18.968+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"With a 3 second snare and a 1.5 second stun that makes 4.5 seconds of continuous cc to keep them in the puddle. She already has the ability to 1-shot most mid laners with little to no AP and giving her a HUGE buff to her pushing power would be.. not desirable for where the game is at the moment. Plus her puddle increases the damage it deals based off the enemies % of health remaining. I mean in lane you are saying for landing a rank 1 snare you deserve to get off your full puddle on the enemy champ... (also you buffed its overall ratio so it not only does its damage faster, but more of it too)","replies":[{"poster":"Ritual","date":"2015-07-30T10:50:03.270+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Yamaxanadu,realm=OCE,application-id=FjGAIbRv,discussion-id=iP598A5p,comment-id=0001,timestamp=2015-07-30T02:35:18.968+0000)\n>\n> With a 3 second snare and a 1.5 second stun that makes 4.5 seconds of continuous cc to keep them in the puddle.
