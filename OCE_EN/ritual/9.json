We should lose less LP when we have an AFK and make players who AFK lose more LP. \r\n\r\nIf someone has left the game for more than 5 minutes (there can be connection losses) then they lose % extra LP for a loss, or a win.\r\nAdditionally people lose a % less for having an afk for 5 minutes.\r\n\r\n&quot;&quot; 10 minutes&quot;&quot;\r\n&quot;&quot;15 minutes&quot;&quot;\r\n&quot;&quot;20 minutes+&quot;&quot;\r\n\r\n...\r\n\r\nLose % less LP for having 1 , 2 , 3 ,4  afks.\r\n\r\nMaking it so if someone has 4 AFKS for 20 minutes they lose 50% less LP.","replies":[{"poster":"JasonWazza","date":"2015-06-13T09:28:23.674+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"Or you could be less of an asshole, likely get less AFK's then.","replies":[{"poster":"Ritual","date":"2015-06-23T04:28:03.734+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"People start a match get into queue select a champion then ... afk its nothing personal","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"CaptainDingus","date":"2016-12-22T05:36:44.557+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"What about when this happens..
