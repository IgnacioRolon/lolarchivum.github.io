That stuff was possible due to a bug with masteries in S3, but it got fixed within the hour, doesn't work anymore... It still caused SO many account recoveries that i stopped counting after a couple months.\n\nAs i said, glitches and bugs can be exploited. Until they're fixed, after that they're only good for scamming people.\n\n(bug was as follows:\nlast utility mastery gave 5% summoner's spell reduction.\nmasteries were saved locally.\nediting the file let you have 20 points in the same mastery, allowing 100%CDR on summoner spells, as long as total mastery points = summoner level\n=\nany summoner spell had 0 cooldown. you could also do other nice stuff, but that was the simplest.\nnow:\nmasteries are server-saved, and cannot be edited)","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"mordain","date":"2015-06-22T10:21:59.975+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"On what do you base this claim ?
