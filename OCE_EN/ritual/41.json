I feel that RIOT should spend more time fixing their existing champions instead of making new ones. \r\n\r\nI understand that something like Kindred or Ekko is much more appealing to players than a reworked Yorick or Urgot, but I would like to see alot of champiins fixed.\r\n\r\nAlso some champions visuals look extremely outdated like Pantheon and Olaf who could use game play updates aswell.\r\n\r\nAs well as some champions abilities having too much counterplay where as others don&#039;t. Morgana&#039;s W only used to proc spelltheifs as a support. Morgana&#039;s W is easy to walk of without chain CC for a Mid laner, and requires her whole team to lock enemies down on it. On contrasts Shacos W gives him hard CC as a high mobile assassin with stealth (Although it only scales with AP, making it not a damage source for AD shaco)\r\n\r\nI would like to see more champions be updated this year.\r\n\r\nThankyou for taking your time to read this post.","replies":[{"poster":"Deep Terror Nami","date":"2015-12-28T18:46:34.805+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The Champ Up team works on Champion Updates (if the name didn't give it away) so their workflow and release schedule is entirely separate from new champions. I think what you really want is for the Champ Up team to simply have more manpower. Sorry if this doesn't help. This kind of discussion is more appropriate for the **Miscellaneous** board if you want to discuss it further.","replies":[]}]}
