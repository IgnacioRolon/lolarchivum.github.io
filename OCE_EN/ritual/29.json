Abilities detonate corruption dealing  ~~(15+5% AP)~~ 2 per level + 5% AP damage.  (although most on hit champions AP only have single target abilities so possible corruption can have a chain detonation effect)\n\n**Items purpose / niche **\n\nTo provide mages with on hit effects spreading like runaan&#039;s hurracane without having them invest in a pointless stat (critical strike chance). It also gives some ok stats for on hit mages to use and is tailored to their needs. The passive detonation with abilities lets them spell weave and gives them a nice little boost of AOE damage and will probably look really pretty. It will give on hit mages more to do without giving them too much insane broken damage.\n\n------------------------------------------------\n\nPatch 101 (28/03)\n\nUnique passive on hit damaged lowered to 15 + 2%AP from 15+ 5% AP\nDamage on proc changed from 15+ 5%AP per level to 2 per level +5 AP damage\nAP lowered to 30 AP\nAttack speed increased to 40%","replies":[{"poster":"Mozzie25","date":"2017-03-23T22:46:55.728+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Would be ridiculously op on champions like Kayle and udyr","replies":[{"poster":"Ritual","date":"2017-03-24T06:16:57.316+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I feel the stats are kind of weak enough for it to have an op passive\n\nUdyr is melee can't use it its an extremely niche for AP auto attackers.","replies":[{"poster":"Mozzie25","date":"2017-03-24T21:11:05.582+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Doesn't matter. That passive Witt 5% Ap scaling more than makes up for it's slightly week stats. When your talking about champions who can get up to 2 Attack speed 5% ap is a lot. And making it proc on multiple targets. You've just added a nashors and hurricane together","replies":[{"poster":"Ritual","date":"2017-03-28T00:34:14.718+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Theres always room for nerfs just like an AP AS item, i could possibly take off the 5 AP ratio on the autos","replies":[{"poster":"Mozzie25","date":"2017-03-28T05:16:42.564+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Sorry dude I just don't think it has a place in league. It's only ever gonna be good for a very very small number of champions. Not to mention you've basically just added the runnans passive to the nashors. \n\nIt's doesn't really add anything.
