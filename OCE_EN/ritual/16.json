I hate vsing her. She also doesn&#039;t bring much to the table as other champs do.\n\nI&#039;d like to see soraka&#039;s heals become less effective and a lower cooldown on equinox. overall a little more utility on soraka to make her funner to play, more effective at play making and not just a frustrating champion who completely fills her team mates life bars and ruins poking phase.\n\nI feel that her equinox damage is too high and scales too well with AP but has a too high cooldown, accidently KS.\n\nIt should deal a total of 60 AP damage or something and have a lower cooldown.\n\nher heals should not be as strong they re very frustrating especially when poking her team and then seeing them 10 seconds later with full HP\n\nHer heals could have temporary resistance increases - so receives less damage off a heal\n\nHer starcall is kind of useless besides the self healing it brings, could make the whole area slow and the middle stun or something nice like that. Also an armour shred on starcall (she alone will not benefit from it but it does open the doors for ad Soraka which is horrible anyway) (possibly lower her base ad since she doesn&#039;t need to auto attack anyway).\n\nover all soraka lacks alot of utility but her heals are extremely annoying and she can do extremely well / extremely bad depending on the rest of the team. Giving her a bit of utility and cutting back on her healing power would be nice\n\nalso a mickaels crucible ult would be nice, more decision making the player doesn't need to know how well they went. yasuo's w blocks all projectiles seems fair to me. \n\nI like playing soraka the way she is, i hate vsing her though its annoying. This is just a suggestion not saying soraka must be changed ... shes bad for the game ect.","replies":[{"poster":"TouchMyKimchi","date":"2015-07-07T13:50:24.501+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"\"it does open the doors for ad Soraka which is horrible anyway\"\n\nUberDanger would like a word with you.","replies":[{"poster":"GigaPube","date":"2015-07-07T20:48:39.172+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"uberdanger would also like to fuck all of your underaged family members","replies":[{"poster":"TouchMyKimchi","date":"2015-07-11T22:33:12.860+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Good thing I have none.

Diversity in champion selection, lack of diversity in ability selection.\n\nI honestly want to see Riot make these changes:\n\nMore AP scaling to starcall, but horrible base damage, while the self healing has amazing base but terrible AP ratios. Self healing **is affected by Soraka's magic resistance more than enemy champion abilities**. This makes AP Soraka slightly discouraged at bot to avoid kill stealing, while not being too bad at solo lane, though MPen can be used for more defensive purposes.\n\nInfusion should have good AP scaling and average base healing. So AP Soraka CAN be done, if the player is smart and aims his starcalls to avoid low health units while the ADC is around. With solo lanes, high AP lets her be the first unique champion to gank with heals only. I'd actually laugh if Soraka was reworked like this, and mid pings Soraka when she roams. \"Oh god no, Soraka is coming, she'll heal me to death!\". Reduce health costs when casted on pets and minions to work as a slightly inefficient, but still viable way of pushing, if Soraka heals all the minions in her wave until another wave comes, she'll either give a waveclear champ a lot of gold, or kiss {{champion:7}} {{champion:81}} 's towers goodbye. While it's inefficient and possibly detrimental against {{champion:101}} {{champion:115}} , etc, it has the element of surprise. \"Wtf, why is this Soraka healing her minions? Scrub can't play LoL, I'm going to roam- where'd my tower go...\"\n\nEquinox should scale like Janna's Zephyr, except terrible base damage and terrible AP ratios in exchange for AP scaling in her silence duration or slow strength. Add high cooldown and mana cost for an escape tool that doesn't actually damage much.\n\nHer ult... Well. It's global, so nothing really needs to be changed.\n\n\nThis way, Soraka top and Mid will be viable, like Lulu.\n\nI haven't given any numbers, so don't yell OP too early.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Coolbluey","date":"2015-07-07T23:35:51.975+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"\"could make the whole area slow and the middle stun or something nice like that\"\nSo basically a leona ult but on a q ability?","replies":[{"poster":"Ritual","date":"2015-07-08T11:08:27.714+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Its really hard to sweet spot them anyway alot of basic abilities stun.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"SorakaXHealBoT","date":"2015-07-08T02:28:42.357+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Soraka is very balanced now and if you want a champion with CC and Heals get {{champion:267}}","replies":[{"poster":"Ritual","date":"2015-07-08T11:06:39.107+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I want her to be op.
