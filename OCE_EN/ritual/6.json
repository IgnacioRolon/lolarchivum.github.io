Your farm is so ridiculously low in almost every game.\n\nYou probably average 2cs per minute, when the aim is to try and average 10cs per min.\n\nYou should play more normals instead of bots and customs to get better.\nYou can practice farming in custom games though, if you wanna improve. Alone in a custom game, no bots, try to get 100cs by 10 mins or as close as you can.\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------\n\nother things:\n\n\"correct runes\" - in what world are mana regen seals \"correct\" ?\n\nYour builds overall are ok, a couple questionable choices but its fine. Hydra on Vi? ok....\n\nNot one game, even when you play support, do you ever get a sweeper or upgrade your trinket\n\nI do not like almost every one of your mastery pages. You should look up a guide for better masteries.\n\nhttp://oce.op.gg/summoner/userName=Intoxication","replies":[]}]}
