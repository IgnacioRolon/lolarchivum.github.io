Unfortunately, it was a noob trap. People would attempt to mix runes together for better ones, even though it wasn't cost effective. When people didn't get the runes they want, they would be sad. Riot decided to removed this. To compensate, they made T1 and T2 runes extremely cheap, giving lower level players no reason to complain when the Recycler is removed.\n\nGenerally speaking, there's no reason to delete runes, only to buy better ones. If you don't want to see the runes, simply uncheck the Tier boxes in Runes. I'd suppose being able to delete the runes would hold similar consequences like that of the Rune Recycler.","replies":[]},{"poster":"UltraFireFX","date":"2015-05-12T13:41:09.793+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"**+1 to this**, or even if we could get something _really_ small back, say 5%-10% of the original cost back?","replies":[]}]}
