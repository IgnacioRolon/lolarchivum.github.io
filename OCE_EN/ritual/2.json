Her ult also helps catch running away enemies. Her E helps her with trades.\r\n\r\nIn team fights the damage modifier makes her W damage scale extremely well and she can heal allies and poke enemies at the same time. Her Q is a decent nuke which provides CC. Her e can be cast on the adc to amplify their damage by ALOT and her R can be a fight starter with damage or a clean up.\r\n\r\nI got the idea from Nemasis draft when I was forced to NAMI mid. I now prefer her mid over support.","replies":[{"poster":"Knuuckles","date":"2015-07-08T11:43:00.749+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Just as viable as any supp mud Laner she just has no wave clear and is rather squishy without much survivabilty","replies":[{"poster":"Ritual","date":"2015-07-08T14:53:01.789+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Really good late game, every support mage is viable thogh{{champion:432}} {{champion:16}} {{champion:40}} are likely to struggle (i havent played janna mid yet though","replies":[{"poster":"Knuuckles","date":"2015-07-08T23:58:31.181+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Reaper Soraka,realm=OCE,application-id=FjGAIbRv,discussion-id=tTamM2uk,comment-id=00010000,timestamp=2015-07-08T14:53:01.789+0000)\n>\n> Really good late game, every support mage is viable thogh{{champion:432}} {{champion:16}} {{champion:40}} are likely to struggle (i havent played janna mid yet though\n\nJanna mid is actually really strong great ratios on her q and e and heals for days with her ult","replies":[{"poster":"xFaker","date":"2015-07-10T08:59:27.854+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"JANNA's W IS ONE HUNDRED PERCENT","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"RUSTYtheCASTER","date":"2015-07-09T01:45:54.260+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I guess the major downfall of Nami is how heavily she gets outscaled, supports have high base damages to make up for their lack of gold income and item scaling.

Destroyed him, despite giving up an early first blood when he hit level 2 first and Flashed in to go all-in with Ignite. He couldn't deal with the Ebb & Flow trades and eventually I could just Q him and tear him down with E autos. While Nami doesn't have great ratios, if you get enough AP on her she does become incredibly strong- her W scales UP in damage/healing on bounces rather than down once you pass 200 AP, and the movement speed from her passive and the slow from her E becomes absurd.","replies":[{"poster":"Ritual","date":"2015-07-08T14:58:17.738+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"They extremely good for AOE abilities her E can nust be cast on the ADC.
