(not including my full tank Nasus mid which will bring the number to 16) (I alsi played a bit of master yi mid which i included in that total, and there was a sona mid game)\n\nI understand yasuo   is free this week but in all my games all I see is Yasuo  or zed  mid even in ranked, with a bit of talon  here and there.  \n\nI rarely see lux, ahri and half the time i see twisted fate he is build ad. It might be because I am in low elo but in most of my games I do not see ap unless the support decides to \"support\"  {{champion:25}} {{champion:1}} {{champion:99}} {{champion:37}} .\n\n-----------------------\n\nAlso i believe that ad mids have the advantage of a high amount of burst  plus sustained damage, which makes them much stronger than their AP counter parts {{champion:1}} {{champion:112}} . I believe AP needs a buff since AD get the advantage of 100% ratio on their auto attacks. (Except Kalista  , who builds attack speed anyway. DPS mages are not as popular as them {{champion:69}} {{champion:268}} (quite popular) .\n\nMagic resist harms a mages burst much more than an AD assassin since they have nothing to follow it up unless theyre {{champion:30}} who lacks burst anyway. DPS mages possibly lack the mobility and self peel of assassins. (not sure why)\n\n------------------\n\n\nAccording to http://www.nerfplz.com/2015/09/2015-champion-tier-list-solo-queue.html the strongest mid laners are AP{{champion:103}} {{champion:1}} {{champion:99}} {{champion:90}}  , and AP do have the ability to one shot squishies at a range but I feel that they are not that strong and a lot of them are underplayed . {{champion:45}} {{champion:134}} {{champion:30}} {{champion:34}} {{champion:25}} (as a mid laner), and Galio {{champion:3}} is very underplayed probably due to the lack of AP. \n------------------------\n\nToo conclude, I would like to see more AP in the mid lane and not see the same AD mids match after match. LOL needs more AP. (Champion diversity)\n\n---------\n\nsuggested buffs - \n\n-(Chasmpions do their AD or AP damage to a tower (omiting the 40% rule) which every one is greater / both of them combined (AD champs build attack speed anyway)\n-more AP ratios greater than 1, a buff to AP ratios (AOE is OP but not having anything to follow up with is quite frustrating)\n-Lowering mana costs (some AP abilities cost more than their ultimate {{champion:99}} {{champion:101}} . All assassins do is win a poke war and dive in when enemy has no mana / runs out of mana.\n-Buff runic blade mastery\n\n-----\n\nSorry that the article is so long there is just so much I want to get off my chest.","replies":[{"poster":"Cipse","date":"2015-09-11T14:42:11.179+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I personally don't agree with some of the things you are saying.\n\n> Also i believe that ad mids have the advantage of a high amount of burst  plus sustained damage, which makes them much stronger than their AP counter parts {{champion:1}} {{champion:112}} . I believe AP needs a buff since AD get the advantage of 100% ratio on their auto attacks.\n\nSo, the common AD mids at the moment are;\n{{champion:157}} \n{{champion:238}} \n{{champion:91}} \n{{champion:110}} \n{{champion:126}} \n\nThree out of the five are melee (Jayce doesn't count because of the fact he can swap). They have burst **because they are assassins**. The fact that they are melee means they have to stay in auto-attack range for them to allow for their sustained damage through auto-attacks - putting them at risk whilst they are doing it. Also, all bar one of their abilities puts them within melee range of the enemy team, so if they don't kill one of the enemy carries fast they're dead.\nYou might say that it allows assassins to win every fight one on one. But that's the whole point of assassins; punishing isolated players.\n\nThe only downside I can think of for Varus and Jayce (about their sustained damage) is the fact that it pretty much forces another player on their team to go AP (generally top) - unless, of course, they want to run a full AD team.\n\n> Magic resist harms a mages burst much more than an AD assassin since they have nothing to follow it up unless theyre {{champion:30}} who lacks burst anyway. DPS mages possibly lack the mobility and self peel of assassins. (not sure why)\n\nAgain, assassins don't have anything to follow up on their burst if armour is built because if they're are constantly auto-attacking they are going to get focused and killed.\nSome assassins get self-peel because of how close they need to be to the enemy when they attack (Yasuo and Zed) but others (like Talon) have none. Other DpS mages don't have self-peel (like Karthus and Cassiopeia) but Azir gets a very reliable escape and his ultimate (both of which are potent self-peel abilities).\n\n>AP do have the ability to one shot squishies at a range but I feel that they are not that strong and a lot of them are underplayed\n\nIf you farm properly and get a burst mage then you should be able to do this (you don't **have** to play Annie or Malzahar to do this. A champ like Xerath, Brand and definitely Veigar (more so against AP mages but still has decent burst against other targets) \n\n> suggested buffs - \n> \n> -(Chasmpions do their AD or AP damage to a tower (omiting the 40% rule) which every one is greater / both of them combined (AD champs build attack speed anyway)\n> -more AP ratios greater than 1, a buff to AP ratios (AOE is OP but not having anything to follow up with is quite frustrating)\n> -Lowering mana costs (some AP abilities cost more than their ultimate {{champion:99}} {{champion:101}} . All assassins do is win a poke war and dive in when enemy has no mana / runs out of mana.\n\n\nHigh AP damage against towers might get a bit ridiculous, if you ask me. But I guess that could work.\nAP ratios on burst mages are definitely fine as they are. Because, especially if you have farmed properly, you can pretty much combo a carry from 100 to 0.\nI personally don't have any mana problems against Yasuo and Zed (I am assuming you are referring to these two, as they have flow/energy).  You conserve and only use when necessary. And if they dive you when you have no mana, it's your problem because you should have gone back to base.","replies":[]},{"poster":"The Spawn Man","date":"2015-09-10T22:45:00.307+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I've been getting 40/60. I usually play AP mid, and it's nearly an equal chance whether I'm versing AD or AP. If it's AD, it's almost always Zed or Yas. But mostly it's still AP. Ahri, Kat, Annie, Heimer, LB, Lux, Viktor, Xerath; I still see them all frequently mid, so I don't think (at least at my ELO) that AD mids are getting picked more frequently.\n\nAs for how powerful they are? Well the only AD champ I find annoying to lane verse is Yas, but then he drops off later in game. I find AP champs faaar more annoying. Ahri and Lux are my grudge-hates, and Heimer, but hey, who doesn't hate Heimer?\n\nSo no, I don't think AP's as a whole need buffing. Once they build into Rabaddon's, high tier AP champs can easily hold their own.","replies":[]},{"poster":"TeCoolMage","date":"2015-09-10T16:52:29.009+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I think people only pick AD mids because assassins look cool in their opinions.\n\nWith auto attacks, either you're an ADC with a completely different purpose + attack speed, or you're a melee AD caster with burst (full AD and no attack speed, don't you dare ever build attack speed on Zed unless it's BoTRK), and no good player would ever let you get much damage with auto attacks.\n\nAP Items are generally better than AD items when you're a caster, AD items get all the icky bits that proc off auto attacks you shouldn't be using while AP items get specialized effects that only affect abilities (even AD abilities, but an AD mid can never buy an AP item without being behind unless it's really good)\n\nTowers already take AP damage, I'm pretty sure. Only ADCs build attack speed so Zed isn't the best at taking towers compared to some long range AP champs that can back off a bit and still deal damage without getting shot.\n\n\nMR does need to be more expensive. I hate MR prices, they're practically handed out like Doran's these days.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Omni Presents","date":"2015-09-10T13:12:05.762+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"AD, especially those with NO resources, mana, health, basically free farm no issues for anything but your health and CD's, are popular at lower ranks.\n\nYou can AA all day with some, like Yi, and others like Nasus can stack Q and do TONS of damage and not rely on tanking. But looking at a good AP mid, Ahri, Lux, someone with skill shots and decent range, they can out do any AD mid. I can take Malzahar mid and beat anyone in lane 1v1, period. I have seen Ahri players go mad and carry games from mid against AD.\n\nBut I have also seen a changing of the guards, not with mid, but with top lane, AP are starting to go up there. Ekko top is a good one. I seen an enemy Teemo the other day go AP top lane. Ryze does good. The AP role will always be a part of the game, it has to be. It used to be mainly mid, but yes with those free resource champs, I see more of a change top.\n\nI think it all depends on who gets first pick and what is needed plus the enemy counters. I picked Garen top the other day, Ryze went in, came top and wrecked me, first 2 picks, Garen and Ryze. This allowed the enemy to than take anyone mid, and since we picked our mid first, they countered that also.\n\nNothing is going to be done really to stop it getting worse. It is a players choice and as long as you can either win, or counter your lane, anything goes, not just mid.","replies":[]}]}
