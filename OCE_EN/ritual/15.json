I have even been forced to support since someone wasnt happy with my nami mid.\r\nI get shocked when people go crazy when I play Morgana mid which is what she was made for anyway.\r\nSomeone dodged when I said I&#039;m playing Morgana top.\r\nAnother time a person who supports warwick was told to go jungle.\r\n\r\nWhy do people force a person to play with the &quot;meta&quot; and if you get beaten in lane its like report this troll.\r\nMost importantly people dodge and do not let you play your champion.","replies":[{"poster":"Crowd Pleasa","date":"2015-07-08T14:31:11.034+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Because the majority of the time you run into a player who plays something off meta in a position that they shouldnt be playing it in (zac support), it ends up going badly, and the player ends up trolling, and when you see that, every zac support you see, you assume is going to be horrible and feed. If im in a lobby with someone playing an off meta champion, i op.gg them and check out their winrate with that champ, if its low i usually dodge. For example, your winrate on soraka is 42%, even though your name has soraka in it, so i would never let you play her anywhere other than support. But your anivia winrate is 89%, so i would suggest you play her in mid, instead of soraka.","replies":[{"poster":"Chicken4dinner","date":"2015-07-09T06:06:29.785+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yeah but that is sooo limited and lazy, my pantheon winrate was 85% at one point and I had played less then 15 games with him but my yasuo win rate is 55% and I have played 107 games with him (or around, haven't checked recently).\n\nNormals btw\n\nDoes that mean I'm a better pantheon?\n\nMore importantly old stats for any reason (your were learning the game/ champ) do not affect how you play now...\n\nThe fact that you are dodging from statistics on an elitist website shows that you are what heart vine described above","replies":[{"poster":"Crowd Pleasa","date":"2015-07-09T06:14:22.653+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"No, if i check your match history and you won 3 out of your 4 past amumu support games, i wont dodge.

I didnt know how to play her properly so lately ive been winning more than losing. Anivia is a newer champ j started to play. My old losses wreaked my rate.\n\nMid soraka is okay in lane but falls off midgane with insane heals i dont lije her mid.
