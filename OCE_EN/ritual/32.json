Very fun and interactive not very stale\r\n\r\nW - Now grounds enemies like cassiopeia W - cassiopeias W provides great team utility. Would make morgana alot stronger as a cc support since mid morgana doesnt seem to be high priority to riot.\r\n\r\nR - Stun occurs after 2.5/ 2 /1.5 (scales with level) - A squishy mage shouldn&#039;t have to stay near enemies for 3 seconds in fear of getting blown up.\r\n\r\nsorry for spelling errors just feeling a little tired lol","replies":[{"poster":"FerrousOxide","date":"2016-12-10T09:47:09.818+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Morg is fairly strong as is.","replies":[]}]}
