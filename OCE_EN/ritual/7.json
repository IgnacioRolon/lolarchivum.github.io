In addition buffs nearby enemies armor and magic resist by a percentage of you armor and magic resist.\r\n\r\nSaphire sight stone - increased mana regen and cooldown reduction ( ability power mabey). In addition basic attacks restore mana.  (essence reaver ftw) or using an ability makes next auto attack slow the target.\r\n\r\nEmerald sight stone - increased health, health regen and cooldown reduction. Using an ability on an ally buffs their attack damage or ability power by % (1 or 2 %) \r\n\r\nOpal sight stone - after placing 3 stealth wards the next ward placed will be a vision ward. \r\n\r\nOnyx sight stone - attack speed + ability power - after using an ability gain attack speed.\r\n\r\nJade sight stone - gain attack damage - basic attacks slow your target by 10% for melee 5% for ranged. \r\n\r\nthese are just examples, if you can think of any other good sight stone enhancements comment them below \\/","replies":[{"poster":"BarryButcher","date":"2015-05-12T14:34:46.934+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"its a cool idea\n\nbut if you give sightstone \"combat\" stats you will see more junglers actually build one and maybe even top laners and it would really make ganking almost impossible if the enemy has 3 sightstones LOL","replies":[]},{"poster":"Olee","date":"2015-05-12T14:01:19.176+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I actually love this idea","replies":[]},{"poster":"Riot Terra","date":"2015-05-13T00:27:13.823+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey Intoxication,\n\nI was having this discussion with a designer the other day actually! I personally like the idea as well. Similar to what you suggested, the ideas we were discussing were around other vision related upgrades - for example, rather than upgrading to ruby sightstone, you can choose an upgrade that only places pink wards, some sort of mobile ward, etc...\n\nNo idea if these items will ever come to fruition, but good thinking!","replies":[{"poster":"Olee","date":"2015-05-14T06:41:36.042+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It's always a massive problem for me when I'm Jungling and playing some massive tank (Like Sej or Gragas) and end up with only 5 tank items at the end of the game because of Sightstone. It might not SEEM like much, but when the enemy has Void Staff/Last Whisper and multiple Borks having that sightstone and NOT a full tank item, really hurts. I WANT to build sightstone on just about all my junglers but it's so disheartening to do so when you're your team's main tank.\n\nDon't make it give you super stats as you do have to sacrifice stats for vision, but let it be a little more efficient. To make sure it doesn't end up being too OP, let it only give it's holder ONE flat stat. For example keep the health that it gives you and then\n\nUpgrade X = +30 Armor\nUpgrade Y = +30 Magic Resist\nUpgrade Z = +10% Cooldown Reduction\nUpgrade Q = +30% Attack Speed\n\nI don't know, but just something that encourages junglers to buy it, as well as the supports. And Riot has always been very vocal in that they want as much strategic diversity as possible, so here's another opportunity.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Ritual","date":"2015-05-13T10:45:10.706+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hi Riot Terra\n\nare you real riot staff!

I'd rather have an active that creates a link, either \"sharing\" damage received between the two champions or granting both a buff.\nEmerald for insight. The vision ward ability you gave Opal fits better here.\nSapphire for divinity. Theming this one after spells is a very good choice.\n\nKeep holding your edge.
