It should be shortened to probably 3 seconds to make her less dependant on annoying cc. Its suration can scale by level making morgana chooose between a longer snare or shorter tormented soil.\n\nIts main use is to proc spell effects now and a bit of bonus damage for snared enemies and its duration should be shortened. \n\nIt should do 35 - 40 ap damage per sec. That would decrease the damage a bit but would make it more reliable. This will also reduce her waveclear a bit.\n\nTormented soil is probably the only lack luster spell in morganas kit and should be buffed. This would make morganas kit perfect imo.","replies":[{"poster":"Ritual","date":"2016-02-01T09:42:53.851+0000","up_votes":0,"down_votes":0,"body":"I dont know how to delete this comment","replies":[{"poster":"Deep Terror Nami","date":"2016-02-01T10:13:14.489+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"On the bottom left corner of the body there will be \"Quote, Edit, Delete\" options.\nhttps://i.gyazo.com/538cfa8889285a1095611e8f7a0bb7bb.png","replies":[{"poster":"Ritual","date":"2016-02-01T10:36:30.653+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I only have reply quote edit","replies":[]}]}]}]}
