Has no apparent humanly features what so ever. Just glows. Speaks with a very neutral empty voice which sounds  like a fizzled radio. Auto attacks look like a piece of him flying to the enemy, fizzled energy. His abilities generally share the theme of a pale wisp of energy.\n\nLore\n\nThe last shard of Aether that existed in the void had arisen a creature which is not of humanly shape. They had taken residence in Icathia hiding in fear. He had seen the hunger in other creatures eyes {{champion:161}} and did not trust other creatures. He would only occasionally go out for a piece of light.  \n\nYet eventually they could not stand his time in their chamber and wanted to go out and devour light. It was then that light had invigorated their insides. They went out bending the very Aether in speed looking for an area with alot of this tremendous light. Finally they had seen the rays. Light so much light.\n\nHe had stopped at an area of a mysterious group of people who called them selves the Rakkor. People who loved the sun, and accepted him the way he was. He had heard that one of their noble warriors had joined the fields of justice {{champion:89}} and that she has been battling other warriors, including some of the void born. \n\nHe takes this as a time to get revenge on the voidlings {{champion:96}} {{champion:31}} {{champion:161}} {{champion:121}} {{champion:421}}  for encapsulating him in darkness. He wants to spark light in the entire void by laying it out with Aether.\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nUpon selection \n\nWe will burn your dark souls with light\n\nAttacking\n\nYou want a piece of me?\nAll this light is making me feel quite strong\nWe shall spread light everywhere\n\nWalking\n\nOOOhhh all this delicious light!!!!\nNothing like a stroll in the sun\nI wonder if I can see the great solari warrior\nTime to get a nice tan\n\nStanding in brush\n\nI don't want to waste some valuable sun time\n\nJoke\n\nI exist! (physicists have disproved aether)\nThis is a piece of light! (instead of a piece of cake, they like to eat light)\n\nWhen casting Q, I have paved a path for light\n\nDance\n\nTurns into a radio wave and bounces up and down.\n\nLaugh \n\nSounds like some warm radio noise \n\nSpecial interactions\n\n-Chogath : We will burn you creature of darkness!\n\n-Leona : The real light warior!!!\n\n-Khazix : My light diet gives me a brighter glow you should try\n\n-Kogmaw : I think you will appreciate I light meal\n\n-Heimerdinger : you will not be doubting my existence after this!\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**Strategy**\n\n...This section has been removed due to too much text...\n\n**PROS and CONS**\n\n**PROS**\n-Enourmous amount of utility, has a slow, an attack speed buff, weak heal, ultimate stun, and a lot of slows\n-has a burst ability that can also be used strategically\n-extremely mobile and helps increase mobility\n-Has good magical DPS\n-good resistance to ignite\n-has sustain\n-scales good with AP\n-can escape ganks\n\n**CONS**\n-Extremely squishy\n-Lacks any good non-ultimate crowd control\n-passive benefits him self more, hard to get someone to step in your trail. \n-will have to sacrifice alot of utility to have effective damage, have to choose between them\n-Lacks a lot of burst damage\n-Has no ways other than their ultimate to counter channeled abilities\n-does not benefit from spell vamp alot, and does not have hard nukes\n-Useless unable to auto attack for any reason .\n-Can not set up ganks well\n-Heal is very weak especially to champs who have low health regen\n\nTo be honest I'm finding cons a bit hard wow!\n\n**Countering**\n\nSupport\nIf he is a support destroy his speed shrines as soon as he makes them, that will exhaust his mana.\nAll in him with a cc support, by surprise so he does not have time to set up speed shrines\noutheal his adcs poke to ensure he starts to run out of mana.\nsave shields and heals for when he buffs the attack speed of his allies\nHas no true escapes so just jump him\n\nMid\nBurst him down, he lacks burst. force him to exhaust his poke\nhis sheild is not that strong so just pop it, hell be vulnerable without it. \n\n**Skin ideas**\n\nNeon, they has different colour flames\nfire work looks fireworkey\npurple blob, a void piece of energy\nsolar flare \n\n**Trivia**\n\n-Aether is the medium which light travels through\n-I originally thought of a man who looks like mercury (the greek god) and had wielded a bow. This idea is a lot more original i guess \n-The idea was more OP but my friend a player who plays lol alot had made some nerfs\n-He idolises leona\n-He was traped in the void, he is considered void born he was made from the light which was originally in the void\n\n---------------------\n\nUpdate 0001\n\nPassive - no longer slows, instead speeds up allies, also decreased damage but damage comes out more consistently.\nQ - a speed shrine older than 10 seconds will not damage enemies, \nW - no longer gives himself increase attack speed\nE - shield halved in strength, owner of sheild now get the trail passive\nR - no changes\n\nReasons - To decrease frustration due to lack of counter play, allow him to be chased down \n                  To ensure their DPS is not too high \n                  Since the passive is permanent a permanent slow is too op, considering champions need to chase.","replies":[{"poster":"Ritual","date":"2015-04-28T11:13:05.336+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Is it a good idea should I nerf / buff them your feedback would be greatly appreciated :)\n\nAlso feedback on the layout and the information contained would be greatly appreciated... I think the 20 % tenancy part is a bit too op and there isn't a lot of counter play with this champion\n\nalso any good changes to lore and features?\n\npresentation of strategy?","replies":[]}]}
