She has extremely good poke and does not allow for counter play. Possibly nerf spear and give her another damage ability because her spear chunks me for 3 / 4 health at time and my poke is negated.\r\n\r\nShen - have not played alot vsing shen but seems fine to me \r\n\r\nSona - Complements her utility dense kit.\r\n\r\nSoraka - LoL&#039; s healer, very strong yet balanced \r\n\r\nTaric - prefer sheild since he is helping other champions tank.

Plus nidalee is extremely squishy, and her new cougar combo is pretty dependant on her landing those spears to maximise her damage output. I like that Taric's heal is strongest when used on allies, but I've never found it to be particularly unbalanced. Combined with his armour passives it makes for a decent kit. \n\nIf I had to question any of the heals in the game it would probably be that of Sona. Frequent heals and shields supported by mana regen (or a tear) and some CDR makes for pretty stale gameplay. Yeah, she's squishy but she's also pretty quick, has quite a lot of damage on her Q (people are still building sheens and whatnot for sudden burst damage) and a group stun if she gets in trouble. Nidalee may have a heal and a fair bit of burst damage but her main source of poke is a slow skillshot and she has no crowd-control.","replies":[]}]}]}]}
