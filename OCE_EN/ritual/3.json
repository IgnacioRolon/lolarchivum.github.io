Champions should be locked in before load out is locked in for last minute mastery or rune changes in my opinion.","replies":[{"poster":"Early Feed Strat","date":"2017-03-04T03:09:31.003+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I don't think Riot would put in the effort to fix a minor issue for a rotating game mode with short game lengths. \n\n Players just have to be aware of how much time there is in champ select and have pages ready to go for most champ types. \n\nIf someone hasn't tried to trade you in the first 10 seconds then it is probably safe to reroll then if you don't like that champ reroll again and get those runes then masteries sorted.","replies":[]}]}
