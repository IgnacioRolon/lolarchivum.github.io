Although I think giving her gounded on the W would overtune her kit a little. Can you imagine her W'ing people which gives you the time to walk up and point blank Q them because they cant dash... bit much imo. Esp bot if shes hiding in the bush.\nThe thing about Cass is she has no follow up CC other than her ult which is dodgeable by facing away so the grounded isn't \"op\" in the kit.\n\nUlt change would be nice. The CC hitting earlier wouldn't be a problem in terms of balancing, it would be being able to proc the 2nd round of damage faster that might prove a tad strong.\n\nMaybe thats where the W change could come in? Nerf (or remove) the 2nd round of damage but add \"anyone who has had their \"Soul Shackled\" takes bonus damage from Tormented Soil\"\n\nI think the passive change would be pretty awesome. There are a lot of older champs that need to have their passive changed. I'm honestly surprised her passive didn't get changed when they removed spell vamp from the items.\n\nThat being said, i don't think she needs a buff at all. She still pretty good and useful. A new passive for sure, just to give her something \"useful\".","replies":[]},{"poster":"FatedSaviour","date":"2017-01-13T09:25:35.950+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"yeeeeeeaaaaaaaaaahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh, no","replies":[]}]}
