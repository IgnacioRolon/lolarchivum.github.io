When an enemy damage enters that field gains a short burst of movement speed. right can only activate every few seconds. Surrounding allies have the same effects in the barrier (needs rework)\n\nQ - a target / skill shot ability which slows an enemy dealing magic damage\n\nIf a q hits an enemy twice they are snared. (slows stack)\n\nsurrounding friendly champions have their movement speed increased ( effects self)\n\nW - An enemy damaged and marked to do less damage\n \nif w hits an enemy twice the enemy is pacified (blinded and silenced)\n\nIn addition nearby allies are sheilded\n\nE - skill shot / target ability which shreds an enemies armour and magic resist % per 100 ap\n\nIf E is cast twice the enemy receives a mark which can be detonated dealing % max health to the target. (Shreds stack)\n\nAdditionally nearby friendly champions damage amplified.\n\nR -  gives him a free cast of an ability. If the same ability strikes a target before the others effect is completed surrounded friendly champions are healed and additional effect occurs.\n\nThe cool down applies to individual abilities caster twice. The same ability will not be free to cast for the cool downs duration.\n\nplease give your feedback below.\nI did not include scalings cool downs ect as it is hard to balance in the game.","replies":[{"poster":"Azirious Mistake","date":"2015-05-26T10:35:48.932+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"This has PBE Karma written all over it.","replies":[{"poster":"Ritual","date":"2015-05-26T13:04:40.944+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"they are spiritually similar\n\ni want the r to have a theme like zileans w, their ultimate was originally their w but i shifted around the utility a bit and spread it out.
