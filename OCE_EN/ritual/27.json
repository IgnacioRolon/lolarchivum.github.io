Madness. She's in a much better position now.\n\nThe reason it still deals a pretty big amount of damage is for two things. One, the hit-box of the spear is very thin. It's easy to dodge and hard to hit; anticipate it and you'll dodge every time (unless you have 200 ping or something).\n\nTwo, its scaling change. It used to be \"deals amount of damage based on distance traveled\", meaning the effect of a spear hitting you close was negligible, but one from afar would [kill you in one hit](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3FJHX-ngpaM&t=01m30s). When Nid was reworked, it was changed to \"deals a certain amount of damage, guaranteed, and then adds a bit of bonus damage based on distance traveled. Bonus damage cannot exceed a certain amount\" End result was dealing near half of the damage it used to.\n\nIf you need some help in learning to dodge, head on over to the [Gameplay & Strategy](http://boards.oce.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/gameplay-strategy) board. They'll give you a few tips.","replies":[]}]}
