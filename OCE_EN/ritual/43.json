This is a support mage who excels at controlling vision through the manipulation of their vision crystals. They can~~ also~~ possibly turn into an assassin though that part of their kit may be cut out. Their ultimate ability is a versatile one like Heimerdinger's ultimate. I would greatly appreciate feed back and suggestions.\n\n[these brackets are for extra information] (these brackets are for stats) {these are for ambiguity i don't have much experience with league}\n\n\n**Autoattack** - Ranged auto attack [like most mages]\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nExample stats can be changed quite easily.\n\nPassive : basic attacks will continue to seek invisible enemies and will reveal them for ***(0.2/0.3/0.4/0.5 seconds)*** [at levels 1 / 6/ 11/ 16 respectively]\nIn addition the first attack this champion makes on an enemy visible by a ward or a champion ability applies a {seen} crystal which will cause consequent attacks deal   ***((3/4/5/6 %) + 1% for every 50 AP) amplified damage*** [at levels 1/6/ 11 /18]. The crystal will remain active for the next*** (2/3/4/5) seconds***. The timer will only start if the victim has left the brush they were in. The passive also applies to revealed stealth champs. The crystal detonates when the effeect is over dealing (0.5/1/1.5/2)% +(1% for every 100 AP) and will deal the same percentage of AP as magic damage of the damage dealt as true {magic damage} damage to when the crystal was on. The crystals stack meaning that if an enemy goes in and out of visiblitiy they get an extra crystal with the same effects. \n\nQ - Throws a tracking crystal - (cooldown (10/9.5/9/8.5/8) mana cost (50/60/70/80/90)\n\n**[linear skill shot]** latching on to the first enemy it hits dealing ***(60/ 75/ 90/ 105/ 120)*** magic damage ~~***(+30 % AP)*** ~~*** (+40% AP) ***which grants true sight of them for (1.5/ 1.375/1.25/1.125/1.0) snaring them for ***(1.0/1.125/1.25/1.375/1.5)*** seconds dealing*** (90/120/150/180/210) *** magic damage ~~***(+40 % AP)***~~***(+60%AP)***\n\nW - Throws a smoke crystal (cooldown 15/14/13/12/11) mana cost (50/60/70/80/90)\n\n    **  On ally cast **: Stealth them for ***(2/ 2.5/3/3.5/4)*** seconds increasing their movement speed by ***(10/15/20/25/30%)*** ***(+1% per 25 AP)*** while they are in stealth dealing (5/10/15/20/25) (2.5% AP) magic damage to surrounding enemies as AOE per per ***0.25 - (100%- 2(CDR)%) (decimal) ***seconds\n\n**On enemy cast** : Blinds them for ***(0.5/0.75/1/1.25/1.5)*** seconds dealing ~~(5/10/15/20/25)~~ ***(15/ 20/25/30/35***) + magic damage + ~~(2.5% AP)~~*** (+7.5 AP) ***per ***0.25 - (100%- 2(CDR)%) (decimal) ***seconds and slows them for slowing them by ***(10/15/20/25/30%)***\n\n\nE - Pulsating crystal - ***cooldown (8) mana cost (30/35/40/45/50)***\n\n Can place a micro turret on enemies, allies, neutral monsters.

The range of the cannon equals to the ultimate's range.\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**Clarifications:**\n\nPassive Q and E will amplify damage as well as shots from E if the enemy is in a brush or the fog of war (invisible when first attacked by these abilities. The damage amplification starts straight away.  Other champion abilities that grant vision will activate this passive only if this champion attacks them. Wards will activate this passive at the first attack. The main point of this passive is to reward this champion for warding while allowing them to be aggressive. If the enemy becomes invisible then visible again and the crystal expires, a new one will be placed if the passive event reoccurs.The final detonation is not amplified by the crystal.\n\nW - ally will remain invisible unless attacked. A micro taunt will be placed on them as that if an enemy just automatically attacks (by standing) the first auto attack will be aimed at the stealthed ally unstealthing them. Already started auto attacks that connect will reveal them, as well as attacks from minions if they have no other target. spells suck as Sona's Q and AOE damages that damage them will reveal them as well as lucky skill shots. The movement speed is more used to run away from a currently attacking champion.\n\nE - If the champion is still between the times that the last shot fired and the next shot starts to fire (i.e. the first shot sprouts out lands on the enemy) then the second one is produced, the second one enjoys bonus magic damage. If they are still from the cast then the first bullet will deal magic damage as it is produced. \n\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nQuick combo ideas\n\nsupport - Q the adc then E them to take care of the support, them standing still will trigger the bonus damage wing them to slow and damage them further or stealthing the ADC.\n\nIn mid Q the enemy if they are in brush AAing them while Eing self. Since they will be snared deal bonus damage with E by standing still using W to prohibit them from recalling and last bit of damage. \n\nescaping gank q enemy then w self and run usefull for initiating ganks.\n\nsince jungle monsters are always still if fought and also can be put into brush allows for great monsters wiping out jungle camps.\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\nUpdate 001 [make the guide easier to read and change nature of champion slightly]\n* Removed alot of unnessecary information changed guieds name\n* modified damages which are just examples\n* passive slightly modified\n* changed q-s ap ratios\n* changed w's affect removed assassination\n* changed the nature of E abit, and added an effect\n* A bit more detail on the ultimate\n\nUpdate 002 [clarification of W and E]\n* w- stealth explained\n* e- stand still explained\n* passive now applies a crystal but has same effect just to clarify if the ability has taken place.\n* Added true damage and detonation at end of passive which might have to be removed...\n\nUpdate 003 [passive clarification and update to make upgrading ultimate worthwhile]\n* Provided damage amplification of ultimate and allowed greater synergy with the passive. \n* Added AP ratio to passive detonation to allow attacking hidden champions in wards good for its self.\n\nUpdate 004 [changes to r synergising with passive]\n* R's damage crystal amplification now scales with ap and R's ability.\n* clarified r and e's interactions\n* included crystal stacking\n\nFuture updates\n* Please leave comments for suggestions\n* concept arts / sketches of abilities / ability icons might come later i am busy this week\n* ~~should seen crystals (passives stack for every time the enemy is in brush? i.e. they have a crystal but go back into brush and are visible and are attacked with a crystal on them, should place a secondary crystal multiplying damages or detonating the first? A reward for multiple wards?~~\n                        ","replies":[{"poster":"BioRowshan","date":"2015-03-19T10:55:06.320+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Nice ideas, hope to see them in action!","replies":[{"poster":"Ritual","date":"2015-03-19T22:24:25.467+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Ill make some concept art and change the name how does sam the secret sorcerer sound?
