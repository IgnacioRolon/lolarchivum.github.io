Not sure if it's ever going to be fixed.\n\nBut here's what I do about it: \n\n1. Go to C:>Riot Games>League of Legends>RADS>projects>lol_air_client and then enter the latest patch folder (should be the one with the largest number). If you recently deleted and redownloaded the projects folder, there should only be one.\n2. Create a new, empty file named \"S_OK\" (without any extension) in that folder.\n3. Launch League with admin privileges.\n\nIf you use a custom volume for League, it will reset. Otherwise, you're gold.\n\nBest of luck.","replies":[{"poster":"Ritual","date":"2015-05-31T07:59:01.978+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"thanks i left it over night it eventually patched lol after the above steps","replies":[{"poster":"HORSE OF FORCE","date":"2015-05-31T10:42:31.766+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hm... did you click \"Repair\" or delete any files/folders from \"projects\" in an attempt to fix it?","replies":[{"poster":"Ritual","date":"2015-06-01T12:11:35.180+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"yeah i did both my lol works perfectly fine now.","replies":[{"poster":"HORSE OF FORCE","date":"2015-06-02T05:44:45.278+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Ah, that explains it. Usually, if you just make the S_OK file, then the patcher completes near instantly (not 'over night'), but if you had [attempted to] repair the game or delete files out of the \"projects\" folder then it would have to download the entire game again.\n\nEither way, it's good to see that it all worked out in the end. Note these instructions somewhere you can easily access them; you may need them later.\n\nBest of luck on the fields of daisies.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]}
