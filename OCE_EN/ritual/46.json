If the opponent is slain with 5 stacks gets transfered to the next enemy. (Stacks with allies bleed stacks)\r\nDarius also owns an item &quot;Darius axe&quot; which gets fused everytime he does\r\n\r\n (infusing Darius to X infuses his axe to X)\r\n\r\nDarius axe -\r\n X-ray deals ()% extra damage per stack of bleed on the enemy.\r\nAt infusion X - if Darius X-rays a karacter with 5 stacks of bleed his X ray becomes a fatality which refunds 3 bars of power.\r\n\r\nAbilities.\r\n\r\nSp1- hard attack which power drains (not part of his kit but stong ability to have on a hyoer carry. (Kenshi sp1)\r\n\r\nSp2 - attack which greatly increases power generation (like his q) (like jason Voorhees sp2)\r\n\r\nX-ray - high damage. (His item gives him passives for his X-ray.\r\n\r\nStrategy - Using darius with a character like scorge Baraka who can increase bleed stacks and piercing Mileena who seals extra damage to bleeding enemies.\r\n\r\nPoor synergies - characters with killing passives (elder god kenshi)\r\n\r\nStrong against - balanced teams\r\n\r\nCounters - resurect enemies (warlock quan chi. Jason) or evade enemies (assassin jade)\r\nCan also take a while to get enough bleed stacks","replies":[]}
