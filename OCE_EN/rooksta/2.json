No matter what time of day, no matter where you are, there are bots in EVERY SINGLE GAME. THe last match I had, both sides had 4 bots on each team. It was effectively me and another Annie on the opposing team.\r\n\r\nIt&#039;s beyond ridiculous at this point. I can&#039;t tell you how many matches I&#039;ve lost or steam rolled because of bots. It&#039;s just not fun and completely pointless. It&#039;s less enjoyable than Practice vs Bots, because you can at least manipulate them, and the AI is SOMEWHAT developed that it&#039;s not just an obvious steam roll.\r\n\r\nI wouldn&#039;t be surprised if the users of bots stole and made a facisimile of the AI code that RIot implemented in the game.\r\n\r\nI&#039;m not committing a single hour more to this game. ARAM was the only mode I really enjoyed playing, and I&#039;m glad Riot implemented it, but unfortunately it&#039;s devolved into a bot farming fest.\r\n\r\nI&#039;m just fucking done with this BS.","replies":[{"poster":"Wuks","date":"2015-11-26T05:41:13.283+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey rooksta,\n\nI found that if you can play enough games with normal players, the MMR of your games will increase, and you'll find yourself playing fewer and fewer bots. You can add me on League and we can play some games together :) Sorry about your experience with bots though.","replies":[{"poster":"rooksta","date":"2015-11-26T06:46:39.777+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The MMR doesn't matter...High/Low it's the same.\n\nBut thanks for the pre-made invite.
