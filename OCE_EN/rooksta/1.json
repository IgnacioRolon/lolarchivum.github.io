A few will instantly say &quot;GG&quot; or &quot;GGWP&quot; once the game ends and they never stick around in the post-game chat.\r\n\r\nThe past 10 or so games I&#039;ve played, there&#039;s been maybe 1 or 2 actual players on either side and the rest are just bots. I&#039;ve asked multiple times for them to verify they&#039;re human (asking them random questions like what colour is the sky etc) because I just assumed they musn&#039;t be very good.\r\n\r\nNope. This isn&#039;t just new players or bad players, it&#039;s almost always bots.\r\n\r\nPlease understand this isn&#039;t just a matter of low level games being spoiled. Where there&#039;s bots, there&#039;s an underground economy. In WoW and MMORPGs it was gold selling. In this game, I can only imagine it&#039;s account selling. That means they&#039;re digging directly into your pockets by selling high level or high IP accounts for profit.\r\n\r\nI know in WoW, although Blizzard acted quickly to implement bans and try to curb the bot invasion, there were entire servers which were abandoned because bots were so rampant that they obliterated the economy and completely destroyed certain aspects of the game (I.e. a zone in the game that got respawn camped so much that quests were undoable).\r\n\r\nMMORPG&#039;s are certainly different, but unless you want this game to become a incestual circle of elite players playing only themselves (War3 DoTA, MTG and so many others), you need to foster a healthy, competitive &quot;training ground&quot;. That&#039;s already been achieved quite well with the levelling system, and by allowing account sellers to continue to use automated processes to negate any kind of progression in this game (i.e. Selling pre-levelled accounts), you&#039;re allowing players to skip this entire process, become either bored or frustrated with meta gaming and essentially lose more players.\r\n\r\nI know this sounds a little on the pedantic side, but it&#039;s not that far out of reach to reach these conclusions. One of the key reasons why LoL exploded in popularity is due to it&#039;s integral summoner progression (Levelling, Rune Tiers etc etc). HoN lacked it, and it turned so many players off.\r\n\r\nAnyways, if at the very least, please add a category in to report this, because it doesn&#039;t really fit into any pre-existing category.","replies":[{"poster":"Ghazan","date":"2015-10-16T03:16:22.624+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I had the exact same experience before I got to level 30 after which its (to the best of my knowledge) always human players","replies":[]},{"poster":"FENTON","date":"2015-10-14T22:50:26.677+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"There are at least 1-3 bots per ARAM game that I go in and it really ruins the experience for everyone.
