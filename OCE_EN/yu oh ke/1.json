I will only play the mobile game if they make it so you can not connect keyboard and mouse. FOR FAIRNESS\n\n2. Make a mmo where you can find the champion in the open world.\n\n3. My best option is make a story telling game like telltale game where in dlc you bring out champion are stories. By end game you have all champion stories. Pick the champ and play there story. \n\n4. Open world make your own random player and explore and open world with no guiding to where to go, ships to travel on water or animals to mount.\n\nIn time i could and more concepts to these idea's or make new ones. \n\nI've been playing league for 4 years now! I truly believed Riot concept team wound do better then me seeing how they get payed.\nI've run my idea's with my friend and they truly thought it would be amazing. \n\nplease read this riot","replies":[]}
