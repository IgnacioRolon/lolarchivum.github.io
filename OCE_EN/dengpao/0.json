And now im placed in low priority queue for 5 games and a bit worried that i might get my end of season reward cancelled due to this problem since its not my fault. Any advice? I do however understand that i need to climb back to promotion again and i have no problem with it since im diamond last season as well as in Chinese Server.","replies":[{"poster":"Aractive","date":"2015-05-11T07:51:39.569+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I have the exact same problem, Had super lag and disconnected and now i have another 5 game ban, just after comming out of one.","replies":[]},{"poster":"HORSE OF FORCE","date":"2015-05-09T04:25:10.210+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":">i might get my end of season reward cancelled\n\nThe conditions are not released to the public up until the reward is distributed, if there is one at all. In order to avoid missing out on it, you should behave well in all aspects of the game at all times, not just whether you leave games or not.\n\nUnfortunately, it's the server's fault, but you won't be able to remove that leave from your profile. There isn't much that can be done. If you'd like to, try bringing it up with support and see if they can set it so it's less likely to happen again in the future.\n\nBest of luck.","replies":[]}]}
