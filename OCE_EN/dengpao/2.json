And now im placed in low priority queue for 5 games and a bit worried that i might get my end of season reward cancelled due to this problem since its not my fault. Any advice? I do however understand that i need to climb back to promotion again and i have no problem with it since im diamond last season as well as in Chinese Server.","replies":[]}
