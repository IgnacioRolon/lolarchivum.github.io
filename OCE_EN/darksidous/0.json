This is when you can play a 10game placement series and get a new rank. That being said, **you are going to be placed lower** than you ended this season. the beginning of a season starts with a soft MMR reset, where it goes down a couple of notches from where it currently is. In the past, even players with 50+% win rates that go 10/10 in placements generally get placed lower.","replies":[]},{"poster":"BananaSlayerAMO","date":"2016-11-08T01:14:53.126+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Patch 6.22 comes out tomorrow at around 6:00 pm AEST, which is when you can play the new Rengar: \nhttp://status.leagueoflegends.com/?en_AU#oce\n\nI think you should be able to play ranked when the 2017 Season begins on December 6:\nhttp://oce.leagueoflegends.com/en/featured/preseason-2017 ","replies":[{"poster":"Cyrater","date":"2016-11-08T08:12:02.250+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"6:00 AM actually","replies":[{"poster":"BananaSlayerAMO","date":"2016-11-08T09:25:42.076+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Ah, true true","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"The Wanak King","date":"2016-11-07T22:43:07.173+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"relax man you will wave to wait until the new patch comes out","replies":[]}]}
