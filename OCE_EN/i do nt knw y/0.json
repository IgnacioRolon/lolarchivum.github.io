The error message says it's your firewall because Riot didn't really think League wouldn't connect for any other reason/it can't find any other reason.\n\nJust to make sure, however, try uninstalling (if applicable) your firewall. Disabling it actually doesn't do much if it's still installed. Do the same to your anti-virus. Then test League with a custom game. If it's still not working, then you know it's neither of those.\n\nWhile you do that, can you tell me what ISP and OS you're on?","replies":[]},{"poster":"I Do nt KnW Y","date":"2015-06-04T04:27:33.272+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Help anyone?","replies":[]}]}
