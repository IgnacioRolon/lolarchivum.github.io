I have two computers down due to the avast bug. The lol files that need to be added to its exclusions are added. I have restarted computer and even disabled avast to try it and nothing works for League now. If I can avoid re downloading the game and patching I will but if not its meh for me for the night I guess for league.\r\n\r\nAny help would be appreciated","replies":[{"poster":"BeSpooks","date":"2016-03-24T08:48:58.500+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I had the same problem until 15 minutes ago,\nHere's how to fix it.\n\n1.
