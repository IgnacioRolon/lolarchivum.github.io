They had it set to one role in Team Builder and the queue times were way too long, there is already issues with long queue times in Bronze so picking only one role would cause problems. If you main support, you'll pretty much always get your first pick, if you main top, it's unlikely. Unfortunately that's the way it is. All I can suggest is to try and take it as practice to get better in your second role as well, and if you really want to play a particular role, take it into norms.","replies":[]},{"poster":"WE WUZ KINGZ","date":"2016-02-03T10:17:48.414+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"learn different roles, a minimum of 2?","replies":[]},{"poster":"Olee","date":"2016-02-03T09:05:57.098+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I used to go Mid-> Support and NEVER got Mid.
