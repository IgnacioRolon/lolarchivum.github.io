He has an arrow up his right arm, an axe stuck in his left torso and a sword piercing his right torso. His scabbard hangs behind him and he has a very noticeable red cape. His left eyeglows red. He's empty.\n\nStats:\nHealth - 406 (+21 per Lvl)\nHealth Regen Per 5 Secs - 6.5 (+1.9 per Lvl)\nMana - 401 (+20 per Lvl)\nMana Regen Per 5 Secs - 2.5 (+1.7 per Lvl)\nAttack Damage - 49 (+2.5 per Lvl)\nAttack Speed - 0.522 (+0.064 per Lvl)\nMovement Speed - 330\nArmour - 37 (+1.8 per Lvl)\nMagic Resist - 19 (+4 per Lvl)\n\nLore:\nRuneterra was battlefield, or a wasteland to many. The Demacians and Noxians fought without mercy against each other. Within the midst of the lands harboured a great but hidden kingdom, a kingdom of peace. Our king was our peacekeeper, no one dared to move against the king, simply because he was far too kind. I was a loyal knight, along side Riven and Yasuo. We had no culture in common, we were of different arts and styles.\n\nWe were found by the Demacians. They proved their worth to us by letting their two elite warriors and prince to stay within our community. There was absolutely no doubt the king would provide a warm welcome. They gave us their names. Garen, Zin Zhao and Jarvan IV. Our king printed their names into the castle&#039;s halls, remembering them with great honour and kindness. Jarvan asked for our aid in the battle of Runeterra, helping them to stop Noxus from reigning supreme and evil all over our lands. However, our king politely declined their proposal, explaining it would endanger all his people and cause a great sorrow within our kingdom. Jarvan understood our situation, and asked for the least of our help for supplies. Our king was able to accept this and signed the contract with Jarvan. They set off in peace, and left us unharmed.\n\nUndetected, a Noxian spy spotted our treaty and land. Then so forth, brought this information to the Noxian Leaders to form an ambush on us. Instead of a straight forward attack, they came peacefully, representing only Swain. He brought us a sword, explaining it was a &#039;gift&#039;. He removed the cloth used to hold the sword and passed it to our king. Our king treasured it and waved a goodbye to the Noxians. But shortly after, Darius and his men rampaged upon our city. Yasuo and I moved to the king&#039;s throne room, only to find Riven shrieking to the king&#039;s death. Yasuo moved out to the citizens to vanquish our enemies. I secured the king&#039;s corpse and Riven. Some of the people dared to reach the king&#039;s throne to make sure he was safe. They charged at us, blindly attacking us. I defended Riven and told her to get out, reluctantly she left me, as they came in harder and more violent, I couldn&#039;t handle it anymore. They had the soldiers on their side and without a hint of what could&#039;ve happened, they killed me. I couldn&#039;t forget what happened, it latched on to my memory.\n\nYears later, I woke. I found myself in a dark blue dimension, looking up at a woman&#039;s spirit. &quot;I am Kalista, the lady of vengeance.&quot; It said. I spoke with caution, but curiosity, &quot;Can you grant my wish for vengeance upon Noxus?&quot; The spirit spoke, &quot;I cannot achieve such a large thirst for vengeance.&quot; I lowered my head, angered to think such a vengeful spirit could not grant vengeance. &quot;However, I can at the least bring your only soul to life.&quot; I quickly raised my head, gleaming with hope for vengeance. &quot;I see you are eager for purpose. Very well, you&#039;ll soon find yourself alive and in an...unfit state.&quot; She started doing her voodoo magic and fired it at me and...\n\nI looked up to find a group of men scampering behind an explorer. I took them as peaceful people. I stood up, scaring the men even more. However, the explorer stood without hesitation, and proceeded to walk towards me. His men warned him to stay away, thinking I was an evil spirit. He didn&#039;t care, he continued to move towards me. When we were within arms&#039; reach, he tapped my armour like knocking on a door. However, instead of feeling the impact, I felt nothing. He dug in my armour, but still I felt nothing. I began to feel for myself, only to feel nothing. I was lost in thought, I forgot what happened between the time I died and now. The explorer decided to communicate with me, &quot;Hello there armoured knight, my name is Ezreal. What&#039;s your name?&quot; I responded to him. &quot;My name is Gaius.&quot; The men were shocked and surprised. Ezreal was satisfied with his little experiment. &quot;Noxus...evil....&quot; I murmured. Ezreals face changed from happy to serious. His men started thinking I was a vengeful spirit. They were right to think that. Ezreal seemed to have the same idea, and decided to help me do my purpose. &quot;Come with me, I&#039;ll lead you to place where you may find some powerful Noxians.&quot; I didn&#039;t care whether it was dangerous or not, Noxian danger is now where I belong. He lead me to a place called the League of Legends. I heard about Riven and Yasuo. Riven was exiled from our lands and joined the League of Legends. Yasuo disagreed with the people and set off, blindly stumbling upon the League of Legends. I gladly accepted to join the League of Legends, and hoped to let my king live away from vain. The Noxians shall fall beneath my feet.\n\n&quot;Leave no crime unjustified.&quot; - Gaius\n\nAbilities:\nPassive: Vengeful Knight\nChampions that attack Gaius and stay in 550 units of him for 1.5 seconds are marked Subject To Hate. When Gaius runs to marked enemies, he gains a movement speed buff that starts at 80/95/110/125/140/155% (increases at at level 4,7,10,13 and 16) and decays over 0.5 seconds to 15%. Marked enemies will continue to be marked until staying out of Gaius' range for 2 seconds. Only one champion can be marked at a time and it has a 45/35/15 second cooldown (decreases at 6/11/16).\n\nQ: River of Vengeance\nGaius slices the ground in front of him, dealing physical damage. A river of vengeful souls spill out after 1 second, dealing magic damage to enemies and applies a decaying slow to them for 1.5 seconds. Damaging a marked enemy instead roots them for the same duration.\nRange - 128\nWidth - 128\nCooldown - 13/12.5/12/11.5/11\nMana Cost - 70/85/100/115/130\nDamage - 30/60/90/120/150(+.5 per bonus attack damage)\nSoul River Range - 500 in a line in front\nSoul River Width - 128\nSoul River Damage - 150/225/350/475/550(+25% ability power)(+0.1 per bonus attack damage)\nSoul River Slow - 45%/50%/55%/60%/75%\n\nW: Cyclone Edge\nGaius prepares himself for a strong wind for 1 second, and spins around, dealing physical damage. Marked enemies hit by this are slowed by 25% for 2 seconds.\nRange - 400\nCooldown - 17/16.5/16/15.5/15\nMana Cost - 70/95/115/130/140\nDamage - 100/130/160/190/220(+.3 per attack damage)\n\nE: Banish Strike\nGaius hacks through the ground, launching a spinning strike. It deals physical damage to an enemy champion or the first unit hit. If the target is marked, the projectile pierces all units, stopping upon reaching the targeted enemy champion and deals an additional 100% damage only to the marked enemy.\nRange - 700\nCooldown - 7/6.5/6/5.5/5\nMana Cost - 90/95/100/105/110\nSword Damage - 75/150/200/250/275(+0.3 per attack damage)\n\nR: Act of Justice\nGaius summons three blades as remnants, making a blade trinity and providing Gaius 3 new abilities for 5 seconds each. Act of Justice's cooldown is reduced by 60% if the first ability is not used.\nCooldown - 120\nMana Cost - 200\n\nThree Actives:\nGale Drill - Dashes foward in a target direction, dealing physical damage to all enemies collided with on the way. The dash stops upon colliding with an enemy champion, knocks them up for .75 seconds and marks them. Enemies marked by this spell will have the mark stay on them until all abilities granted by Act of Justice are used. If Gale Drill does not hit an enemy champion, the ability immediately goes on cooldown.\nRange - 600\nBase Damage - 100\nAttack Damage Scaling - 50%\n\nFound Resolve - Deals physical damage plus 5/7/9% of the target's maximum health to the marked target and knocks them back slightly for 0.5 seconds.\nRange - 300\nBase Damage - 150/190/230\n\nVanquish Demon! - Gaius strikes his sword down on an enemy, dealing physical damage them and applying a 99% slow which decays over 1 second.\nBase Damage - 200/250/300\nRange - 300\nBonus Attack Damage Scaling - 30%\n\nOverview:\nGaius is a melee fighter, who makes sure his opponent can never escape his deathly grasp. His attacks are slow, but Vengeful Knight allows you to chase enemies even when getting kited and most of your spells do not cancel movement. Once you&#039;ve applied your CC on your target, you&#039;re sure to get the kill, make a really good trade or keep an enemy pinned down.\n\nTeamfights:\nIn team fights, use your ultimate and engage with Gale Drill. Dash into the fray and either pin down a peeler for the team to go in on the carreis or go straight for the carries themselves and pick them out of the fight. Either way, your team will most likely follow up because the peeler can't protect the carries or there are no carries to kill your teammates.\n\nItem Build Suggestions:\nGaius is all about diving into the team, dealing tons of damage and pinning down enemies. His spells have long cooldowns so CDR is important. Building damage is important but because Gaius' spells have long cooldowns it's much better to build tankiness for endurance in long fights. So an ideal build would be:\n{{item:3111}} {{item:3156}} {{item:3071}} {{item:3053}} {{item:3742}} {{item:3142}} \n\nRunes:\nTake AD or Lethality runes to maximise damage and armour and magic resist runes to endure some damage. Movement speed quintessences would also work well to help avoid duck hunts and run in faster to land CC.\nAttack/Armour Penetration Damage Marks 9x\nArmour Seals 9x\nMagic Resist Glyphs 9x\nAttack/Armour/Movement Speed Penetration Damage Quintessences 9x\n\nMasteries:\nGaius' ideal role is to go in, pin someone down and keep them pinned down. Going the down either the Ferocity or Resolve tree would fight the style of an aggressive playstyle. The Fervor Of Battle keystone would help to end fights midway. The Strength Of The Undying keystone would help deal more damage and sustain in long fights. The Courage Of The Colossus keystone would help tank some damage when engaging in a fight.\n\nSummoner Spells:\nTake {{summoner:12}}  and {{summoner:4}} , as you will the need to join in team fights. {{summoner:4}}  as always is a great spell for escapes or advancing. {{summoner:1}} and {{summoner:6}} are suitable spells as well.\n\nPlaying as Gaius:\n- Try to land River of Vengeance early game on the enemy before unleashing your basic combo.\n- Save your ultimate for teamfights to maximize its potential.\n- Note that most of Gaius&#039; basic abilities have a 1 second charge time. Time and aim your attacks so you can deal some damage\n- Gaius&#039;s abilities are mana expensive, use your mana carefully or get more mana.\n\nPlaying against Gaius:\n- Keep watch of River of Vengeance and Cyclone Edge, when he wastes those that is your time to strike.\n- Note that most of Gaius&#039; basic abilities have a 1 second charge time. Use this time to escape or make your move.\n- Gaius abilities are expensive in mana, make him waste his mana.\n\nVoice Lines:\nChampion Select - &quot;Once a proud knight, now a vengeful lost soul.&quot;\n\nMovement - First Time - &quot;And so the search for revenge begins.&quot;\n                  - &quot;I thirst for vengeance.&quot;\n                  - &quot;What more is there to live for if it&#039;s just vengeance?&quot;\n                  - &quot;This war has dragged out far too long.&quot;\n                  - &quot;Do not bring others into unnecessary matters.&quot;\n                  - &quot;Violence, against violence.&quot;\n\nJoke - &quot;Knock, knock.
