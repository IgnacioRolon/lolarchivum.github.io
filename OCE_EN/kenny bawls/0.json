So after I got home from work, I decided to play some league.  3rd match is against these guys.  In loading screen, their entire team&#039;s % stayed at zero for a min or so, then the game starts while i was watching youtube on another tab.  \r\nGo into mid lane, open tab to see the enemy team hasn&#039;t bought anything so I think they&#039;re afk.  after 2 min or so, the enemy morgana, lulu, and katarina comes in mid lane so I tried talking to them in all chat.  there was no response.  \r\nThey only moved in straight lines up and down the lane, nothing else.  They were csing pretty well however, when I engaged, they did not attack me back except for morgana.  Katarina even Turret dived me but ended up AAing the turret.  They used summoner spells at completely random moments.  \r\n\r\nI&#039;m not sure what they were...    Any inputs?","replies":[{"poster":"IVIemories","date":"2016-02-27T07:51:42.731+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Open a support ticket and report this, if this was a matchmade game, then there are some serious issues with either your client or the server;\nIf this was a custom game with bots, then there is a issue of champions without bot AI going into game.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Kenny Bawls","date":"2016-02-27T08:37:09.979+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Just to clarify, it was a blind pick game, not bots","replies":[]}]}
