I am pretty sure our elo or the enemy team elo were not this low. I wrote a letter to riot games to help me understand this situation but didn&#039;t really help. I really think this wasn&#039;t a fair result. Can someone please explain me clearly about this?

But if you look at who you played against.\n\n1st game: Silver players in a Bronze V ranked team\n2nd and 3rd game were against the same team: Gold players in a Bronze IV team\n4th and 5th game were against the same team: Gold/Plat players in an unranked team\n\nSeems legit that you would get high bronze since your opponents were not really that good in terms of TEAM ranking","replies":[{"poster":"angrymaori","date":"2015-07-15T05:12:57.948+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I see.

Probably has something to do with the fact that you can make a new ranked 5s team so easily if you lose a few placements or start dropping too low. It wont take you very long to climb anyway, a team of mainly plats with half decent coordination will essentially never lose to bronze/silver/gold players","replies":[]},{"poster":"GoldenTomat0","date":"2015-07-15T05:46:56.138+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"because ranked 5's mmr is different to soloq mmr.","replies":[{"poster":"TouchMyKimchi","date":"2015-07-15T06:11:10.115+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"^\nThis.\n\nI reckon every single ranked team landed fairly low ranked after provisionals because regardless of your individual solo Q ranks, your team is effectively B5 until proven to be better after you continue to win..\n\nUnless of course you happened to get matched against highly ranked teams in provisionals you would be placed higher from 5 wins.\n\nGood luck angrymaori","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"xSmokey","date":"2015-07-15T02:56:52.083+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"That's a strange one considering all of your team members are of fairly high rank, what was Riots reasoning behind it?","replies":[{"poster":"angrymaori","date":"2015-07-15T05:14:45.711+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Riot said: \"Please know that the 2015 Season is a fresh start for everyone who plays ranked games. Your last season's performance carries weight, along with your placement matches, but this doesn't necessarily mean you will be placed in the same division you ended in last season.\n\nWe made some changes to the Leagues system this season that should allow players to more quickly reach the League that appropriately reflects their skill level.
