You got no Armor VS an all ad team.\nTry getting a frozen Heart next time, for Armor, Mana, and Cooldown reduction.\nAnd you didn't itemize appropriately.\n\nYour Miss foutune games, both 40 mins each.\nyou have really poor CS for a 40+ min game as a marksman.\nSo you should work on that.\nAnd you have died alot, so work on NOT dying. CS is worth more to you in teh start to mid game.\nIt doesn't matter how low they got or were, 2.5 Minoins waves = 1 Kill.\n\nThis was an issue in alot of games.\nAnd the talon games, Poor CS for a talon, and negative or almost flat even KDA.\n\n----------------------------------------------\n\nWork on CSing about 80 Minions per 10 mins.\nThat's the minimal, and try not to die as much, the less deaths you have the less gold they earn.\n\n-----------------------------------------------","replies":[{"poster":"ThatsBS","date":"2015-10-13T23:49:30.855+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"80 minions per 10 min? Wow i thought it was 70. 80 minions is a bit harder to get and maintain especially at his elo.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"McRuthless","date":"2015-10-13T00:17:43.352+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Getting fed doesn't win you games if you don't know how to carry. Looking at your warwick and shyv builds i'm not surprised you're stuck in bronze. Doesnt matter how fed you are if you go full damage on a melee champ and the enemies can just oneshot you every time you go in lategame.","replies":[]}]}
