Got connection problem while loading (my network is absolutely fine) ----&gt; reconnect ----&gt; dc after 1-2 mins ----&gt; reconnect ----&gt; dc again. This issue happens during the whole game. Sometimes I can&#039;t cast spells or move and then &quot;attempting to reconnect&quot; message shows up. All I can do is watch myself killed by enemy and my team start to ping me.\r\n\r\nI reinstall league but it didn&#039;t work. This is a torture for people like me who only play ranked. System regards me as leaver which made me really annoyed cause its not my will to AFK. Please solve the problem ASAP.
