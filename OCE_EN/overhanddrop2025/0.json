You really need to do something about this its ruining games and making people drop ranks. It just ruins games when you get bronzies who are constantly just feeding and losing games.","replies":[{"poster":"Ingénue","date":"2018-01-31T07:37:58.169+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I went through your match history and I can see no bronzes. A few S5-4, but that's pretty normal considering its the start of season and everything is still settling while everyone gets placed.\n\nJust because people do bad in that one game you have with them, doesn't mean they don't belong at the rank they are. Low elo players are notorious for being inconsistent af with their plays, and it is not uncommon to see a player go 15-1 one game and 2-12 the next. You likely do the same.

Once you have played a decent amount of games (usually around 100) the impact of these players on your games becomes negligible.","replies":[]}]}]}
