Can anyone please tell me if what I said was actually abusive or was this Riots system screwing up? I donâ€™t think what I said warrants a ban so I want to see what you guys think.","replies":[{"poster":"Project Xayah","date":"2019-12-26T12:34:47.288+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"This seems unusual, definitely not enough shown there for a ban, in my opinion. The only problematic parts of those logs would be the spam, and that shouldn't be enough to trigger a punishment. I'd definitely recommend you submit a ticket to [Support](https://support-leagueoflegends.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/requests/new) (use the \"Discuss a personal suspension or restriction\" option) and appeal the ban, hopefully they'll be able to fix it up if it is a false positive, or they should at least be able to bring up any chat logs that weren't included in the reform card (mind you, I can't think of why there wouldn't be more there for this anyway).","replies":[{"poster":"2muchcc","date":"2019-12-26T12:36:50.506+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"ok thanks.

If Riot is trying to stop spam, you should at least only get a chat restriction, not a 2 week ban.","replies":[{"poster":"Rallick","date":"2019-12-27T01:50:49.037+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"As above.\nI don't reckon that it should count as spamming anyway considering it's not even close to a majority of game time; obviously you were pinging and calling baron while people chased in jungle or something, so trying to shotcall. No flame after when people did/didn't concur with the call either. But even if it was considered spam, that's not worthy of a 2 week suspension, or consistent with Riot guidelines on 'appropriate behaviour', spam gives a chat restriction of 10 games (assuming no prior issues). I had a dude flame me in all chat for stunning him twice then threaten to come to my house and kill my family, and judging by op.gg he played on blissfully aware for weeks with no interupption to his playing time, so if that isn't worth a suspension..... maybe you offended Riot by not saying happy holidays.","replies":[{"poster":"JasonWazza","date":"2019-12-27T03:11:19.461+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"Unfortunately Rallick, this assumes that Riot are consistent at all with their punishments, when years of proof have proved otherwise.\n\nSome people can get away with instant ban phrases while others can't.\nSome people can int 100's of games away some can only int like 10.\nSome people can abuse people every game they play, others get annoyed once by someone like this and bite back and get instantly banned for doing so.","replies":[{"poster":"Rallick","date":"2019-12-27T21:12:34.794+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Agreed.
