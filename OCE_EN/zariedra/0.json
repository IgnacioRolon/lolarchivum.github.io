Kind of not going anywhere skill wise, I&#039;m stuck :(\n\nAny help very much appreciated.","replies":[{"poster":"Nightjar","date":"2017-03-24T01:53:41.200+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Well watching support streamers would probably help.\n\nI'm bronze trash but I've noticed that you could be putting down a few more wards and maybe aim for more deep wards. Also your support picks as of recent are nice towards your teamcomp but deeper in your match history sometimes the team comp wasn't as strong. Also your kill participation and consistency is pretty solid so good job there being proactive.\n\nOverall your match history is good and I believe you will be able to climb. Your normals match history even has a few master tier and diamond players in there, so you probably just need to play more ranked games.","replies":[{"poster":"Zariedra","date":"2017-03-24T05:02:50.870+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thanks so much man! : D","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Gesteppie","date":"2017-03-23T19:16:20.824+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Getting an adc to consistently play with will help quite a bit. It's good to learn how to read peoples movements before they make them as a support, and when you're in good sync it's easier to make them epic plays :)","replies":[{"poster":"Zariedra","date":"2017-03-24T05:03:32.547+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yeah, I've been struggling to find an adc duo partner :( feels bad haha","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Dark Warrior","date":"2017-03-23T20:31:37.633+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"man i feel ya i was at same position as you, then i quit mid and spam Top shaco and now i am G4","replies":[{"poster":"Zariedra","date":"2017-03-24T05:04:20.686+0000","up_votes":0,"down_votes":0,"body":"That's the way man :P It just feels like I've hit a plateau :(((","replies":[]}]}]}
