However, we were presented a problem, and I offered my solution; players were concerned that moderation was being taken too lightly in the past, and I give the response that I would take extra care to enforce our rules against personal attacks and other Boards rules moving forward. \n\nI was stuck between a rock and a hard place- I understand that we had left posts up longer than they should have in the past, but I also believed that it still didn't condone personal attacks moving forward. As such, in the original thread, I reviewed it and surmised the following:\n\n[When you play League of Legends](https://boards.oce.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/miscellaneous/fcId228r-when-you-play-league-of-legends)\n\nThe thread in itself was making a statement upon the presumption that the Oceania servers were an English speaking server, and that players have the expectation to speak English on said servers. While I personally believe that this presumption is ignorant, it's a valid discussion within the community that doesn't attack any social/political/ethnic group. If I see an attack on another group, implicit or explicit, I will remove it; similarly, if I see an attack on another individual, implicit or explicit, I will also remove it. \n\n[Racism is OK](https://boards.oce.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/miscellaneous/XsuJqeUb-racism-is-ok)\n\nThe comment noted in this thread was extremely racist, and it did bring to light a number of issues with the way we've been handling moderation as of recent. This is also the thread that I said I'd commit more of my time working to improve the environment on the Boards. Since then, I've personally reviewed every post and comment made on the Boards, and have been able to make myself more available to communicate with, as communication *is* a two-way street.\n\nI'm not defending bigots, but I will defend respectful dialogue so long as it doesn't cross the line of racism. If you disagree with my actions, I welcome that feedback such that we can discuss this further.","replies":[]},{"poster":"JasonWazza","date":"2017-10-27T01:07:59.403+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":3,"body":">Thread here exists entirely to put down people who don't speak English - fine.\n\nI'm pretty sure no one was putting down people who don't speak english.","replies":[]}]}
