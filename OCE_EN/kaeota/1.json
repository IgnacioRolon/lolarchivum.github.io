ADC Main, because I love fighting from a distance and the clearly objective role. \r\n\r\nI was super excited for the marksman item patch - was silently hoping that we could finally either not need a support in our lane 24/7 or go somewhere else!\r\n\r\nLiterally read the &quot;all adc&#039;s&quot; section and uninstalled. Checked in on games in the last few days, and the outcome confirmed my choice.\r\n\r\nWhat did you *want* to do with this patch? You said to reduce sustain and overwhelming crit force - solid objectives - to encourage more early fighting bot lane and remove the squishy nuke effect. \r\n\r\nSustainability is our answer to the mobility of other lanes, reducing it needed something else - say adding moving through minions and extending the duration of fleet footwork, or perhaps making the defensive masteries worth picking on ADCs. Removing sustain isn&#039;t going to encourage ADCs to fight more early, it&#039;s going to encourage them to fight less because when that mid/top/jungler comes bot you need full health to have beyond an average hope to gtfo. \r\n\r\nCrits nuking squishies sucks a bit, but again it was an answer to the tank / off-tank meta we&#039;ve seen being dominant for... well a long time. If it wasn&#039;t the primary meta it was still above off-meta. I won&#039;t deny ADCs had their time there too, but tank meta was why we used crits (well, that and the fact that we can buy one or two pen items tops before we literally don&#039;t do damage). The fact that we nuked squishies with it when we were ahead was a side effect (a fun one, it made up for them two-hitting us before we got to that point, but it was unbalanced). \r\n\r\nWhat you *did*? You made ADCs not worth playing. You gutted a class to the ground then spat on it with items that benefit those assassins we&#039;re terrified of more than us. \r\n\r\nADCs had sustain because we don&#039;t have defence. We have a support with us because we can&#039;t survive alone barring a couple of exceptions. ADCs used crit because you made it the only worthwhile build path. \r\n\r\nADCs had very, very little room in their game play - we had to stick to a support for twenty minutes because to be worth our presence we needed a lot of farm - we absolutely had to take towers, but couldn&#039;t do anything about it without the team agreeing to do so. We played ADCs the way you *forced* us to play them Riot, now you&#039;ve said that the way they&#039;re played is damaging to the game? \r\n\r\n&quot;Shut up and play whats meta&quot; - is a good motto to climb with, I&#039;m not here to complain that I can&#039;t climb because of this.\r\n&quot;Play a game to have fun&quot; - losing games because at 20 minutes someone decides to AFK or troll because someone else took a canon, a support who takes CS intentionally because you picked an ADC they dont like - without asking if you had a sup preference -, a jungler who wont gank because... actually I&#039;ve no idea why the junglers that don&#039;t gank do so, they raraly talk. I took all this with the &quot;fun&quot; of playing LoL; I *want* to play a marksman, I *enjoy* being able to kite and chip people down slowly while hoping to hell that my team will come help me. I don&#039;t enjoy having you decide that an entire role is suddenly so bad they need to not exist. I don&#039;t have fun playing melee champs. And to be honest, I don&#039;t enjoy heedlessly losing game after game because you still. do. not. know. how. to. balance.\r\n\r\nI&#039;ve grown tired of you messing with balance entirely around pros - you&#039;re completely within your rights to have a &quot;pro patch&quot; you know, you don&#039;t need to balance a game millions of people play - for fun - around a couple of thousand who play *professionally*. I understand you have a lot of money tied into eSports, but balancing this game entirely around that eSport is humiliating and degrading to *your actual player base*. \r\n\r\nAm I good? Hahahahaha. No.\r\n\r\nAm I complaining because I&#039;m trash? I don&#039;t think so. I think I&#039;m complaining because you&#039;ve continuously and repeatedly made changes to the game for the sole intent of balancing around professional players, instead of the games player base.\r\n\r\nI was super excited about your ranked changes for next year btw, they sounded amazing. \r\n\r\nI&#039;m angry because I&#039;m really, really sad that you&#039;ve made this change - because it means that you either intentionally killed ADC, you didn&#039;t care what happened to ADC, or you&#039;re genuinely that out of touch with your player base and the average player ability that you think that these are good changes. \r\n\r\nI&#039;m disappointed because you wont even tell us what the intent of the coming patches is in full - &quot;oooh but there&#039;s suspense!&quot; I don&#039;t give two twitches about suspense, I want to know that the game which I play, the primary game I played, to have fun isn&#039;t going in a random direction without at least being open for feedback. \r\n\r\nI wanted to be mad and just ragequit and never come back, because I honestly think that&#039;s all you deserve Riot, but I loved this game. And for the love that others may find in it, I want you to realise what happens when you pull these patches out like this. I&#039;m not coming back, no matter what you do to &quot;fix&quot; this patch. Why? Because I don&#039;t think you care about players of my skill at all, despite the fact that I&#039;m probably around average on the playerbase count level. And I honestly cannot and will not ever trust you to work on this game for anything more than to make Worlds as showy as you possibly can. I&#039;ll probably still watch that for a few years, but after that I hope to forget about LoL. And about you Riot. \r\n\r\nSo long, and thanks for all the Fish.","replies":[{"poster":"Frost1c3","date":"2018-06-10T02:08:15.821+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"Oh look another adc who is mad that he is not the center of every fucking game, really man? There are plenty of adc's that have mobility (Ez, Trist ect) and if you think that supp needs to be there 24/7 then you sir don't understand how to play against duo's. It really is irritating when bitchy ADC's complain about this, you guys are spoilt for dmage, can easily build anti tank now (Fucking True damage) and still have access to lifesteal, free movement speed, and extra shields. adc's were a toxic part of LoL for eveyone, if the ADC was bad or lost lane, then me as a JNG/mid or top was gurenteed to lose game, the new changes somewhat fix this overwhelming reliance on Bot lane and put them back to what they are needed for, sustained anti-tank. I say good riddance from players like you who are upset that they are not the center of our fucking universe. Now to drop those bloody yasuo mains and its all good.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Socon","date":"2018-06-09T11:50:31.530+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"Nothing has changed for adcs, they literally just changed what's good on them. The moment marksmens can't kill people from range and poke down turrets is the moment adc dies. You're experiencing something that all veteran players have felt before and have either given up on the game too tired to keep adapting to the changes, or simply don't care enough to worry about the changes and just play whatever is good.","replies":[{"poster":"meganuke","date":"2018-06-09T13:25:45.998+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"a lot has changed for the adcs, no, what they changed is not good on them.\nmarksmen cant kill people if they are dead.\nthe other part is true, but thats exactly what he wrote.","replies":[]}]}]}
