Learn when to give up certain things, there&#039;s a reason i ended the game 15-2 and that&#039;s because i played smart and didn&#039;t go into a fight i was going to lose. Funny enough i still got raged at for carrying, i would&#039;ve muted but it was amusing listening to the things they were saying.\n\nAlso, message to the idiots that say &quot;im a smurf&quot;, don&#039;t say you&#039;re a Diamond smurf when your smurf has a 50% winrate with 522 games, it just makes you look like an idiot.","replies":[{"poster":"Jink","date":"2015-10-02T14:30:29.167+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"\"apparently i should've 2v5 with the Riven to defend our turret\"\n\nNah Riven should have been good and just penta'd 1v5 like a decent Riven.","replies":[{"poster":"Unseen Predator","date":"2015-10-02T16:20:28.319+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"No such thing as \"good\" in Silver.","replies":[{"poster":"Samurai Jin","date":"2015-10-05T03:08:11.600+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"or gold","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Essembie","date":"2015-10-01T21:29:36.008+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I had a malph take turret aggro at an open, uncontested turret last night and he blamed me for his death because he didn't wait literally 3 seconds for the friendly creep wave....","replies":[{"poster":"Unseen Predator","date":"2015-10-02T14:19:58.994+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You'll encounter these types of players a lot in the lower elos, some people are just that damn stupid.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Bipolar","date":"2015-10-01T17:37:52.599+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":">apparently i should've 2v5 with Riven to defend our turret\n\nRiven could have gotten a penta with that as she's broken.\nOP is bronze for playing Riven wrong.","replies":[{"poster":"Unseen Predator","date":"2015-10-01T18:14:16.352+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Enemy was full health with Baron buff, i probably should've mentioned that lol.\nAnd i wasn't the Riven, I was with a Riven.","replies":[]}]}]}
