At the time I let a troll support get the better of me; tilting myself and consequently ruining the experience for the people I was playing with at the time. Back then I was a juvenile 14-year-old, and at the time I didn’t understand the severity of words, I genuinely thought I was justified in what I said. It’s now November 2019, I dropped League for the year so I could focus on my last year of high school (it really paid of, although that didn’t stop me from watching Worlds when I had an exam I the morning :) , but I really want to get back into it. Although I have another account, this KingscopX account holds so much sentimental value to me. I made the account in 2011, marking the craze of league in Australia, to this day I cherish the memories of me playing with my friends from primary school, high school, and the three close friends I made who were from the U.S. (at the time there wasn’t an OCE server). I personally know that I have out grown my childish tantrums, and honestly knowing that makes me happy and should be enough. But knowing how much time, money and the memories behind that account, it’s hard to give up; hopefully someone from Riot reads this. I understand that Tyler1 was unbanned, and if this wasn’t favouritism to him being a streamer, I believe I deserve a second chance as well. If you read this far, thanks for your time; and I hope to see you on the rift.","replies":[{"poster":"Sallice","date":"2019-11-17T09:51:25.644+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You won't get unbanned, once its perma banned for toxic behaviour thats it, perma.","replies":[]},{"poster":"bgentle2myashe","date":"2019-11-16T03:23:11.675+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hi KingscopX. \nFirstly, I'm sure you can see for yourself I am not a mod or Rioter so anything I say can be taken with a grain of salt. \nHow-ever, I do wish to commend you on your efforts. It's not easy to stand up and admit responsibility in the face of public ridicule or even in the secluded depths of your own mind (if it is genuine). It's a big first step to not only gaining something you lost in the real world but it's also a big deal psychologically. Just keep in mind that genuine and heart felt regret for ones actions is not undone by any amount of words no matter how somber or convincing. Only actions and time can truly heal those wounds. \nGood luck on your journey =-).","replies":[]},{"poster":"BabyJ4 Da Prince","date":"2019-11-26T00:42:44.030+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"lol nice try bro, I wish you would get unbanned but I dont think you understand that RIOT is a joke and they dont care. trash company, lets go play other games, just forget it. coming from someone who has made multiple new accounts here and just trust me, its not worth it youre gonna get banned again even if you make a new account and it will probably be for some shit you didnt deserve to get banned for again. Theres plenty of other games out there why support this trash company anyways.","replies":[]}]}
