Go through support with this, you can open a ticket [HERE](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/requests/new).\n\n2. There is no guarantee they will agree, Riot has no obligation to give you anything.\n\n3. You will have a much better chance if you submit a piece of artwork (attach it as a jpeg or png)\n\n4. This is a one time deal. Riot will only do this for you once. \n\nGood luck ♥","replies":[{"poster":"KingscopX","date":"2016-07-06T08:03:17.255+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Ok thanks alot :D","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"KingscopX","date":"2016-07-05T07:28:09.447+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"[](http://file:///C:/Users/rithik.dias/Pictures/Untitled.png)","replies":[]}]}
