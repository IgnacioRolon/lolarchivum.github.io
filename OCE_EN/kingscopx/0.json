The thing is I know i have been toxic but the game i got banned from was a close ranked game where both teams could win from the slightest mistake, so the enemy team was was defending when I (full build) decided to solo baron I got it to 4k hp when my support Thresh all chatted and said &quot;wow jinx is 1v1 baron&quot; then their jarvan came and one shot me and their team got baron and elder drake. I was quite angry and dissapointed (i thought i was going to get demoted to bronze yes its sad im still silver after like 6 years of playing please dont roast me I was 9 when i started) that my support would do me like that and gave up on that game and we lost like 5 mins after that. I really hope Riot unbans my account, but everyone says if its perma banned its gone forever, but i just found that my reason for getting ban should be considered unfair. So please unban my account or at least give my rp spent on that account to my new one. \r\n\r\nBTW I have gotten 2 week suspensions before and I have learnt to not tilt as much but occasionally if my bot lane goes 0/10 or someone ints in my lane ill get toxic - but to be fair we all have\r\nGame 1\r\nKingscopX: FUCK ME\r\nKingscopX: i clicked t owalk away\r\nKingscopX: but then i hovered over cait
