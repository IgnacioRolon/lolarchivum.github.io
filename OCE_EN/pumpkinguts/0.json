Annie","subforum":"FanFiction","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"I was in the middle of finishing my truffle fries when I heard her voice. \r\n&ldquo;Annie!&rdquo; \r\nI looked around the room and saw Veigar trying to keep a straight face. Then I felt it hit me. My vision slowed and it was like I was splashed by a cognitive wave. Before I could do anything about it I had two fries stuck in both of my nostrils. Our entire group laughed as I plucked the booger-laden fries from my nose. I knew I shouldn&rsquo;t have come today. Stupid College of Magic and their preppy students. I wouldn&rsquo;t have come if it weren&rsquo;t for my parents. It would have broken their hearts.\r\n\r\nI looked across the table and saw Luxanna sit back down, beaming from the attention she was receiving. Even Ezreal had stopped talking to Ahri and was checking her out. I held Tibbers, allowing him to absorb the rage I was feeling. Her time will come, I told myself. It was one lesson my parents instilled in me from an early age and I was starting to believe it. I could obviously get her back right now, but it would make me look savage and give her time to react. She would expect it. Instead, I would wait for my opportunity. \r\n\r\n&ldquo;I hope everyone enjoyed their lunch,&rdquo; said Morgana, returning to gather us. &ldquo;This afternoon we have a special presentation from Professor Leblanc.&rdquo;  Morg was a first year student here, and was giving us a tour of the College today. You could tell this was the last thing she wanted to be doing. She moved like a bot and had less emotion than a Gromp. Every once in awhile her eyes would turn white and she&rsquo;d stare distantly, seemingly deep in thought.\r\n\r\nLike a bunch of minions, we followed her outside of the Dining Hall. It was a dark day and the clouds were red, absorbing the heat from the sun. Lots of older students sat on the grass, conjuring light above them so they could read their books. \r\n\r\nOur path led to a large pond that students lay next too, enjoying the breeze it gave off. I enjoyed being at the back of the group, because it saved me from hearing Lux likely trying to impress Morg and her horrible fake laugh. Ahri followed just behind them and then Ziggs and Veigar were between us, cackling like two hyenas. \r\n\r\nZiggs peeled off from our tracks for a second and took out an object from his pocket. With a strong toss it made it in to the pond beside us. He counted down to Veigar, &ldquo;3 2 1.&rdquo;\r\nFollowing a small explosion, a large pocket of water splashed up, soaking two students that were studying. Ziggs merged back in to the line stifling his laughter with Veigar. Morgana looked back and remained oblivious.  \r\n\r\nWe&rsquo;d arrived at the large lecture hall. On the sides of the steps were statues of different League of Legends Summoners. Two of the cooler ones were Maokai and Pantheon. \r\n\r\n&ldquo;Future students,&rdquo; said Morgana. &ldquo;Meet Professor Leblanc.&rdquo; \r\nFrom the shadows of the lecture hall, two of the exact same lady emerged. She was beautiful. They were both beautiful. Moving in perfect harmony they stopped and one of them disappeared, leaving a lady with perfect hair, flawless make up, and an expressionless face.L \r\n\r\n&ldquo;Welcome to the college of Magic,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;Believe it or not, I used to be one of you.&rdquo; After many years of practice, hard work and unlearning I have achieved what I am today.&rdquo;\r\n\r\n&ldquo;What do you mean unlearning?&rdquo; piped Lux. \r\n\r\nLeBlanc, glared at her, as if she was trying to find her way in to her mind. &ldquo;Unlearning is forgetting what you think you may know now. I can see it in your eyes,&rdquo; she continued. &ldquo;You think you are ready for things that you aren&rsquo;t&rdquo;. \r\n\r\nLux rolled her eyes and glanced to Ahri. \r\n\r\n&ldquo;How dare you disrespect me,&rdquo; said LeBlanc tilting her head sideways. Pulling out her staff she casted some chains that shackled on to Lux, holding her still.\r\n\r\n&ldquo;Sorry,&rdquo; screamed Lux, fighting her tears. &ldquo;Please let me go.&rdquo; \r\n\r\n&ldquo;Very well,&rdquo; said LeBlanc releasing her grip. I never thought Lux would show emotion like that. Everyone has their breaking point I guess. &ldquo;I suppose you are all wondering what you will learn here at the College of Magic. Deep within us we all have our natural abilities that some you may already be practicing. Not only will you work on mastering these, including your timing and precision, you will also learn to increase your ability power. On top of this you will learn how to best defend yourself from your enemies&rsquo; powers and how to counter them. Last of all, you will find your ultimate source of power here. This is something that won&rsquo;t come natural. It will happen at different times for different people. I found mine in my first year, others still haven&rsquo;t found theirs in their fourth year.&rdquo;\r\n\r\nLooking at Lux, LeBlanc continued, &ldquo;The difficult part is summoning your ultimate at the right time. Too early and your foe may get away. Too late and you may never get the chance. I suppose you&rsquo;re all wondering what mine is &hellip; of course you are. I&rsquo;ll need a volunteer.&rdquo;\r\n\r\nAfter seeing what she did to Lux, we all backed away slightly, except for Veigar. He danced right up to her. &ldquo;I will,&rdquo; he said.\r\n\r\nEntranced on the presentation about to take place I focused, seeing if I could learn anything. I paid attention to her eyes, her stance and concentration. Right as she performed her spell I felt the same whiplash I had at launch. My neck was stunned and something fell in to my pockets. Out of the corner of my eye I saw one of  Zigg&rsquo;s bombs fly up and land underneath LeBlanc. In the middle of her spell she couldn&rsquo;t react and it exploded, sending her flying back.\r\n\r\nMorgana&rsquo;s eyes went white and she looked back at our group, infuriated. LeBlanc arose from the ground, her eyes darkening with long slits forming under her lashes.\r\n\r\n&ldquo;Did that really just happen,&rdquo; she screamed. Morphing in to two people she flashed around the room checking our pockets.&rdquo;\r\n\r\nAt the exact second she reached in to my pocket, I realized what had happened. She pulled two more of Zigg&rsquo;s bombs from my pockets. \r\n\r\n&ldquo;Let this be an example for the rest of you,&rdquo; she screamed. \r\n\r\nBefore I could react I felt the chains attach to my wrists locking me in place. Then I saw the flashes. Orbs of light came flying in to my face, exploding as they hit me. If the stun from Lux was a slap this was a torture chamber. I couldn&rsquo;t see and felt more orbs plastering in to my body, stinging me. My rage infused. This was all Lux. Gaining sight, I saw two more doubles of LeBlanc flying in to me, striking me with her staff and sending more Orbs at me. I started crying but couldn&rsquo;t move from the chains I was locked in.\r\n\r\nGripping Tibbers I felt flames erupt from my body. Letting out a scream I imagined Tibbers growing and saving me. I wanted him to hurt Lux too. She did this. One more Orb hit me but this time, it wasn&rsquo;t as painful. The flame was helping to reduce her damage. I closed my eyes and this time I felt Tibbers leave my grip. I was him. Slashing the staff out of LeBlanc&rsquo;s hands I jumped and landed on Lux, pinning her down. \r\n\r\nI opened my eyes and saw LeBlanc and Lux both on the ground.\r\n\r\n&ldquo;Have you seen my bear, Tibbers?&rdquo;","replies":[{"poster":"Oneechan","date":"2016-07-10T12:43:53.727+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The ending was hilariously awesome.
