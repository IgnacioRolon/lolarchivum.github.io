A FIZZ feed in mid, i decided 'fuck it, if you want something done, do it yourself.' so i went mid next game, and i needed the win for my promos, in champ select we get a good team, but are in serious need of a tank, the last pick was our top who had Xin as their preferred champ, Xin isn't quite tanky enough, so some of our team asked them if they could go tank.... no communication at all. Then 3 seconds before the timer stopped, they switch to Quinn and lock in.. Then start the game, no communication, feed mundo then AFK for the rest of the game....\n\n\nThe universe just saves all the retards for promos.. thats just how it works.","replies":[{"poster":"WE WUZ KINGZ","date":"2016-05-07T06:35:29.014+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Some people use LoLNexus to check game stats, and they can see if you're in promos.
