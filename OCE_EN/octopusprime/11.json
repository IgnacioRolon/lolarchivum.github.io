Out of nowhere I got disconnected, then for 5-10 minutes it would say \"reconnecting\" and I'd briefly get into the game for perhaps two seconds then disconnect again.\n\nAfter giving in exiting the game to try and reload, I get to the loading splash screen and get to 100%, to which I get a message box saying;\n\nNetwork Warning\n     You have disconnected. Please check your internet connection and try again.\n\nNow, I know my internet connection is 100% fine here, because not once through either of these games did I lag, or have any issue with ping or download speed.\n\nBoth times I am unable to get back into the game, even after resetting router, computer, and relogging.\n\nProvider is iiNet. Some feedback from Riot on this would be appreciated, as I'm sure I'm not the only one this is happening to, and perhaps people are not speaking up about it and putting it down to their own possible connections before looking to the forums.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Mindstar","date":"2016-07-20T06:18:26.930+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey OctopusPrime - what ISP are you with?
