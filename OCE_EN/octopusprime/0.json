The instant i q&#039;s him, windwall would go up, inhuman reactions. Then i said &quot;scripting?&quot; in all chat and then he started to use his windwall really late in fights to try to show he wasnt (he obviously turned them off).

I have watched the clip many times and he starts the cancelling tornado windwall cast animation over half way through your channel time. Now, he was casting his tornado at the start, so it is entirely possible that he is scripting and it had a delay.\n\nMaybe he is using macro scripts for the incredibly fast cast time between Q and W. But I don't think he is windwall scripting.","replies":[{"poster":"OctopusPrime","date":"2016-05-27T13:08:51.705+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yeah he did this about 9 times though, without the q the other times, my recording software broke so i dont have the other times but riot should be able to access the replay, its pretty obvious from the others.","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"JasonWazza","date":"2016-05-27T15:33:43.811+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The biggest giveaway is when you use a champion with a boomerang ability, and then put the windwall up on the way back because it's just come off cooldown, to protect nothing.\n\nAs for this, a lot of yasuo's use the wall as they send out a knockup Q.\n\nIf you had a different video maybe it would be proof.","replies":[]}]}
