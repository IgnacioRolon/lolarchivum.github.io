I hadn&#039;t shown anyone my password or email password and stuff like that so they could act as me and do bad things. And it also says check your email that you used for the account for further details, so I went onto my email and there was no email there, I looked and looked and still nothing. So Riot could you please like check it out, see if anything is wrong, and contact me in a comment or something like that if you need to tell me about it. Thanks. Yours sincerely, SSuperLLion.","replies":[{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2016-04-02T09:53:00.711+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Sometimes they'll end up in your spam folder, did you check there?
