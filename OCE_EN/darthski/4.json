I run my own company which has branches in LA and the Bay Area, and I do everything from television production to graphic design and web development. I've played violin since I was 4 and spent my whole life preparing to be a concert violinist until I decided, the year before my college auditions, I wanted to pursue a career in film so I changed courses and started my own company in LA when I moved there at 18. I love spending my free time playing basketball, video games, and spending time with my friends and my wonderful girlfriend. My favorite types of movies are animated films like Emporer's New Groove, The Lion King, every pixar movie, etc.\n\nI've played video games off and on my whole life, mostly games like League and WoW but I also love playing old school shooters like Doom II. With league I've found that I love the more tanky champions that still do lots of damage and when I discovered  Udyr, I found the perfect champion for me. With the new developments in this preseason, I'm really looking forward to the strength of Udyr this season.\n\n\nStrengths and Weaknesses of Udyr\n\n\nOverall,  Udyr is one of the strongest mid-late game champions there is. His speed, damage and tankiness combined make him a deadly threat to almost any team comp. Let's start by looking at his strengths.\n\n\tGreat clear, very hard to be counter jungled. Maxing Phoenix Stance contributes to Udyr's incredible jungle clear.\n\tIncredible at splitpushing. Udyr's splitpushing powers are unparalleled. Once he's sated with this build, he can easily 1v1 and sometimes 1v2 or more dependent on how ahead he is, so the enemy team has to either send at least 2 people for you or just one and then you kill them and take their base. See more about split pushing in the section below.\n\tVery high mobility. Once your Bear Stance is maxed and you get the full speed boost from it, you are pretty much uncatchable since you can spam between Bear and Turtle, which gives you massive move speed and a shield every few seconds, plus the fully stacked passive  Monkey's Agility.\n\tCan solo drag early. Your early game kit is perfect for soloing drag, so make sure to obtain those objectives early, read more about when and how you should solo it in objectives section.\n\tStrong CC with stun. Your stun is very unique in that you can stun every enemy on their team in under a few seconds. Using Bear Stance on an enemy puts a 5 second debuff on them where they can't be stunned again. In team fights this can be very useful as you can help peel by stunning their frontline, and then dive the backline and stun their carries before you roast them with your phoenix.\n\tOne of the highest damage champs late game. As you'll find out very quickly, this build gives you one of the highest damage outputs in the game once you're sated with rageblade. After that you can go tanky, but once you hit your power spike around 15-20 minutes don't back down from fights, don't be afraid. Pretty much no one can 1v1 you the rest of the game unless they're insanely fed.\nHowever, Udyr has his downsides as well, specifically one major one: crowd control.\n\n\tCan be kited by champs with high mobility / cc. Unfortunately, even though Udyr has many strengths, this one thing can be a massive problem and is the main reason he is not played much in LCS. He relies on face to face combat, pummeling enemies down with his fists, but because of that, he can be locked down / kited fairly easily. Stuns, slows, fears, binds, silences, etc pretty much all remove Udyr from a fight. This is what we have items for though. The reason you almost always purchase  Mercury's Treads is because it reduces the duration of all crowd control by 20%, which is incredibly strong for you. For teams with a lot of crowd control (  Morgana,  Leona, etc ) or champions that have disable ults such as  Warwick or Malzahar, buy a  Quicksilver Sash early. That is one purchase that you will never regret as it makes you much more dangerous in team fights or 1v1s.\n\tVery mana dependent. All of your skills cost mana, and to play Udyr to his maximum potential, every fight requires you to rotate quickly through your abilities. This can run Udyr oom very quickly, so you need to keep an eye on your mana bar before entering a fight and know about how many stances you shift through before you just become an auto attacking bear. Also, always take the first 2 blue buffs unless mid lane desperately needs the second one as it will help your jungle clear and ability to gank lanes immensely.\n\tNot a strong tower defender. As powerful as you are 1v1, in order for you to wave clear you have to be in melee range of the creeps for a few hits, this leaves you very vulnerable in comparison to other champions that can wave clear from further back. This means defending a tower against a stronger opponent(s) alone will be very difficult for you.\n\nMasteries\n\n\nIf you're going devourer you want to take the Ferocity tree as it will give you incredible amounts of burst damage mid-late game. Fortunately with the new mastery system you don't have to sacrifice too much tankiness since you can still put 12 points in resolve.\n\n\nFerocity Tree\n\n\n\nTier 1 -   Fury\tvs   Sorcery\n\nFury is the only viable option with this build. The 4% attack speed is all around far better than magic damage when you're going sated devourer.\n\nTier 1.5 -   Double Edged Sword\tvs   Feast\n\nYour choice is between more sustain or more damage, and honestly this isn't a debate either: Double Edged Sword all the way. As Udyr your sustain is already crazy high. Add  Hunter's Potion to the mix and there's no reason you'd need Feast. Plus the 3% increased damage is insanely strong.\n\nTier 2 -   Vampirism\tvs   Natural Talent\n\nVampirism is definitely the right choice here. Especially with the Runic Armor talent you take in the Resolve tree, the lifesteal you gain from Vampirism is much stronger than a bit of AP/AD.\n\nTier 2.5 -   Bounty Hunter\tvs   Oppressor\n\nFor Udyr's kit, the best mastery here is Bounty Hunter. Once you kill 2 different champions, this mastery will give you more damage than Oppressor. Since you only have one stun for a short period of time, you can't make great use the 2.5% increased damage to enemies with impaired movement. This is simply sacrificing a very small amount of early game damage for a ton of damage late game (5% increased damage once you've killed each enemy champion).\n\nTier 3 -   Battering Blows\tvs   Piercing Thoughts\n\nSince we're going phoenix, you want to get Piercing Thoughts. The magic penetration will help you shred tanks.\n\nKeystone -   Fervor of Battle\n\nYayyyy 6.1, they finally buffed Fervor of Battle making it by far the best keystone for Udyr! Since you're going sated rageblade, your attack speed is already hilarious, so you build your fervor stacks from 0 to max in a matter of seconds, which gives you unparalleled burst damage that far exceeds any of the other keystone choices.\n\n\n\nResolve Tree\n\n\n\nTier 1 -   Recovery\tvs   Unyielding\n\nRecovery is the better option here. Even though you'll be building some MR and Armor items, overall you make Unyielding useful until you're pretty much full build\n\nTier 1.5 -   Explorer\tvs   Tough Skin\n\nThis one is personal choice, but I've found that the movement speed isn't very useful, whereas Tough Skin will make you a bit more tanky in the early game to help your jungle clear and ganks.\n\nTier 2 -   Runic Armor\tvs   Veteran's Scars\n\nSince you'll be maxing your  Turtle Stance second, the best mastery in this tier is Runic Armor. It makes your turtle far more powerful, as it increases your lifesteal and shield by 8%.\n\nTier 2.5 -   Insight\tvs  Perseverance\n\nThe last mastery in this tree you want is Insight, and this one isn't up for debate. The 15% reduced cooldown of your flash and smite is far too valuable to give up for 75 health.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFlash vs Ghost\n\n\nThere is a lot of debate with  Udyr as to which summoner spells you should take. In actuality, there are very few scenarios in which ghost is more beneficial than flash on Udyr. First off, you have no ability to go over a wall so any time you need a fast escape to prevent death, or a jump over baron/drag pit to steal objectives, you'll be screwed without flash. Second, in team fights there is no better way to disrupt a combo / take out the enemy carries than flash. Let's say for example that a team fight starts and the enemy team has an MF who starts to channel her ult. Instead of ghosting and possibly being cc'd along the way to her and being dead by the time you reach her, you just instantly flash onto her, stun her, and save your whole team from the ult while 2 shotting her while she's stunned. Or for another example, let's say their team has a killer wombo combo (malph/ori/yasuo) for example. If they engage on you, you won't be able to ghost out in time but you can flash their engage and blow up their carries instead.\n\nFor early game ganks, flash and ghost are pretty much even in terms of usefulness. Both have their benefits, but if you use them properly you can easily secure kills. So overall, flash is much better for team fights, objective steals, and quick escapes early game. The only time I would advise running ghost over flash, is if their team has an insanely strong team fight and yours is more of a split push / pick comp because the one thing ghost is best for is split pushing. You can outrun the enemy team for days so you can pretty much split push without any concern of being killed. But again, this is not a very common circumstance, and even then I'd be hesitant about giving up all the benefits of flash.\n\nTL:DR\n{{item:1402}} {{item:1410}} {{item:1414}} {{item:3285}} {{item:1402}} {{item:1414}}","replies":[]},{"poster":"Roguestoney","date":"2016-02-09T20:20:46.041+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Generally Maxing R is always best.
