Lets say you are blue side(your team spawns on the left of the map), its 6 minutes in or so and you see  their jungler in bot river heading to gank bot lane. You at this time are in the enemys top side jungle doing the raptor camp. Assuming their jungler goes for the gank bot but fails it, (because of the ward), he will then head back up to his bot side jungle and farm whatever camps are their, or go for a gank on mid. And from start to finish this process is going to take around 1.5 to 2 minutes. If you were to clear his entire raptor camp when he first walked over the ward in botside river, by the time he has returned to his top side jungle the camp would have respawned, so your counter jungle really had no effect. If you leave one raptor, he is forced to clear it and now cannot gain the xp or gold from that camp for another 2 minutes. It will also let him know hes been counter jungled and tilt him. Short answer, in pretty much all situations you want to leave one small one.","replies":[]},{"poster":"BarryButcher","date":"2015-06-06T10:44:02.608+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Personally I counter jungle the smaller camps, but try to clear the buffs.\n\nThat being said, it depends on who you playing, what time of the game it is and how much control you have.\n\nIf your gonna \"nunu\" it, and live in the enemy jungle, clear everything.

With buff camps you should basically always take the whole camp so you have the timer and xp, unless you really need to get out fast or something. The smaller camps you can consider leaving one up depending on the situation. If the enemy is in the area already and will just kill the remaining one soon after you leave, you're not denying them anything by leaving it up so you might as well take the whole camp (them finding an empty camp vs them finding a camp with 1 minion in it). Also if in the mid-late game your team has control over the area already you should take the whole camp so it will spawn again for your team to keep taking. Leave one up if noone is around to clear the small one and it will actually slow him down (them finding a full camp vs them finding one with 1 minion in it). The less small minions are at the camp the more xp/gold you miss by leaving one so probably only worth considering at raptors and wolves.","replies":[{"poster":"Darthski","date":"2015-06-06T09:35:12.933+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thanks this helps a lot.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"JasonWazza","date":"2015-06-06T09:16:29.500+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You have to also remember that leaving the one minion up is also a mental thing, it gets to people more then them finding the entire camp gone, especially in the early game.","replies":[]}]}
