We're aiming to always get them up the next morning. We'll make sure these get put on the site today. In the mean time you can check out the Youtube channel. They'll still only generally appear here the next morning due to the time to cut, process and upload the vids after the games.\n\n","replies":[{"poster":"Darthski","date":"2016-02-04T00:12:36.739+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thanks Cpt.
