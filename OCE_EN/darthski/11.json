If someone can't do anything in the client for 5/10/20 minutes, in sets of 5, because they kept DCing from games it gives them a reason to choose not to leave or to sort out their connection/computer issues. Having it apply to everyone who queues with them makes some people not want to queue said punished players while they've got LPQ which, in turn, results in the punished player having a worse experience.
