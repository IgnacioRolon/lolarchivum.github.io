Or mastery points and account bans. Or rank and account bans. They have no correlation either. You've still spent time earning all that stuff regardless of wether your account gets banned.\n\nSo if you get banned, they should just transfer over all your stuff right? Seeming it has no correlation. \nIf that the case... Soooooo whats the point in even banning an account?\n\nThe whole point of having your account banned, is that you have to start from scratch with EVERYTHING. Thats the incentive for not being toxic.\n\nIf you just got back all _(or even some)_ of the things you lost, how is it an incentive?","replies":[{"poster":"Scottez","date":"2018-03-14T07:41:11.976+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"you know what you do keep though, your skill level at the game, and the ability to play certain champs, which as i said, has no correlation to a ban. Rank you can get back within a week of your 10 provisional games, providing your plat or under. What you cant get back is the time spent getting mastery points. So yes, you lose everything when you lose an account to teach you your lesson.
