Even if I do ward the correct areas, ping ganks out, build appropriately for my team, peel for adc or engage fights, whatever my role in team is meant to be. As I see it most people in silver only think of supports as ward bots that&#039;s all. \r\nSo as of right not I have not been playing support for some time. Im now maining jungle for the moment because it&#039;s the closest think to a support in my opinion but still has the ability to carry your team. \r\nNow I peaked at gold 3 last season and I&#039;m confident I&#039;ll get back there with just a matter of doing the grind. But I just want to ask the other support mains is there actually a point where we are appreciated in the team and where we don&#039;t get dumbass adc&#039;s that blame us if they die.","replies":[{"poster":"Captain Fortune","date":"2016-03-22T04:28:10.133+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I am not a support main I play AD Carry but I have played in around master tier as support and here’s what advice I can give you.\n\n**Be more than just a physical support be one in chat as well.**\n\nWhat I mean by this is that when you are playing solo queue you will play with all types of players. Ones that are having a good day, those who aren’t ones who are in the middle. When you are playing support try to keep your teams spirit high and be the voice that your team needs. Sometimes people say that a simple smile can make peoples day, a simple gj in chat after someone gets a kill in your lane or another can do the same thing. While you are doing this as well you will notice that your team will start paying attention to the chat a lot more because of you making it is a positive envorement. With this in mind use this to your advantage to make shot calls for the team. Call rotations, ward placements, keep the team focused what needs to happen next so they can all follow the same goal!\n\n**Keep your champion pool short and sweet so that you can auto pilot and focus on other things.**\n\nWhen I say this I think it is best to play 1-3 champions in each role so that you can really get a grasp for how they play. Once you play them enough you will notice that you won’t have to think much when playing them and it will become natural to do what you need. When you reach this point you can play the basics of the champion without dedicating too much brain power to it and use the rest of it in other areas such as more complicated things in the game. Examples of this would be if you want to roam, rotating where your wards are around the map or thinking ahead of time in the game of what you want to be doing in X minutes.\n\n**Keep doing what you are doing and don’t lose heart!**\n\nThe best thing that you can do as a support main is keep positive. Learn from every mistake and help your team learn as well. Even in games that you think you can’t possibly win you can still learn something from it. What I would suggest is to start a journal of all your games. You don’t have to write out big paragraphs about every single one of them but write down at least one thing that you could have done better that game. At the end of the week go back and have a look at what the most common thing that you could have improved on is. Then going into the next week use the extra brain power that you don’t have to use because of auto piloting to make sure you do that well!\n\n**Final notes**\n\nAll up keep going, you can climb it just take time. Everyone hits a wall at some point in their ranked journey and that is normal. All you have to do is find what is you need to improve on change it and keep going! If you have any questions or you want to add me in game feel free to ask. As an AD Carry main I would be happy to bot lane with you in a normal game or two and tell you what I pick up on from said games that you can improve on.\n\nSorry for the wall of text and I hope you learned something!\n\n_**Elam**_","replies":[{"poster":"Darthski","date":"2016-03-22T09:50:55.205+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=LGC Elam,realm=OCE,application-id=Ntey9fRZ,discussion-id=f0m8TsM4,comment-id=0001,timestamp=2016-03-22T04:28:10.133+0000)\n>\n> I am not a support main I play AD Carry but I have played in around master tier as support and here’s what advice I can give you.\n> \n> **Be more than just a physical support be one in chat as well.**\n> \n> What I mean by this is that when you are playing solo queue you will play with all types of players.

Went from silver to plat last season playing mostly support(and not duo with anyone) so its definitely possible to carry. If you're picking playmaking supports and roaming a lot early you can get a big lead for your team in the early game, and even though they might throw sometimes, you'll win more often than not. Also look to adapt your play to your team, if your ADC isn't very good but you have a fed mid/top laner who seems to know what hes doing, make plays around him and protect him in fights instead.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Vanilla Bread","date":"2016-03-22T04:54:38.839+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Legit play yi. ez wins","replies":[]},{"poster":"Yasei Doubutsu","date":"2016-03-22T02:47:11.380+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"As a support main.\nI can confirm that it can be tough sometimes, but only if you give in.\nI also find it annoying when other supports don't rush a sightstone or buy pinks or even get any ward items.\n\nBut its not solely your job to ward, its everyone's.\nBut most of your games as a support will be, you trying to ward/counter ward with sweeping lenses.","replies":[]}]}
