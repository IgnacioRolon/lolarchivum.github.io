If you're not one of those people then please skip the bottom two paragraphs.\n\nAs someone who's been through depression and anxiety, courtesy of PTSD after nearly being crushed to death at work, the self-harm aspect comes from wanting to stop the suffering. It took me 5 years to finally beat it, I literally lost 5 years of my life to this shit and throughout that time I went through the following (which is just a sliver of the whole, and doesn't include the loss of all my savings) every single day. There were times I felt like giving it all up and it was only the thought of the impact on my family and friends that stopped me from doing it, that's right, I didn't kill myself because of a selfless motive, not because I wanted to go on living.\n\nAnxiety can manifest through panic attacks where you hyperventilate and literally feel like you are dying (I used to get these a lot in supermarkets, though the worst ones were at home, where you hope to feel 'safe/sheltered) - for some people these can happen multiple times a day. \n\nThe depression side can be a permanent feeling of dread, self-worthlessness, questioning the meaning of your existence at all, you end up feeling guilty about everyone who is close to you suffering because of you; getting understanding is one of the hardest barriers to coming through depression since as a society we still treat it as a 'harden up' issue, and that's even when you've finally mustered enough courage over weeks to talk to someone about it - my own father changing his attitude was one of the biggest 'victories' - before then I felt like an utter failure. On the topic of feeling like a failure your own mind is spamming that shit at you constantly and you grow to hate yourself. \n\nSo reading the comments here I feel disgusted at the complete lack of empathy from what seems like the majority of posters (even after you subtract the obvious trolls). I'm making this reply to you though just cause it seems like you're willing to give the issue some thought, and just maybe when someone in your life is going through this you'll be able to show some understanding and empathy, you could genuinely be saving their life by just getting them to talk about it and know they're not alone.\n\nAs for people telling people to kill themselves in game whilst raging (cause this is totally healthy, acceptable, and normal right?) in the same way you can save someone by being that one little light that suddenly gives them enough hope to not take their own life, a thoughtless insult can equally be the last straw that someone needs to end it all.\n\nFinally to these ignorant people saying that people who may take these insults seriously are weak and should just die, those same people you call weak are probably fighting harder than you ever have done in your lives to just continue another day. Also statistically between 8-12% of the worlds population suffers from depression at some stage in their life, so there's a good chance that unless you're living under a rock in your mums basement your whole life there are going to be people you know who will go through depression, and I pity them if this is the understanding they'll get from you - I hope they have other friends and family who are better than you.","replies":[{"poster":"AnArtillerySpec","date":"2015-04-29T06:06:49.020+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Very well worded mate.

This is because he believes that he survived through depression by getting help from support programs and by not complaining about the abuse they get from non-sympathetic people in virtual and non-virtual platforms of communication. He told those that are too weak to get out of depression to go kill themselves even though he himself had suffered from the same troubles.\n\nI forget his game name and I can't be bothered trudging around the archived OCE forums to find the post, but what I do remember was that I felt like he was a complete asshole and probably lied about his depression experiences. I didn't understand how he could not give any amount of shits about those that had suffered through what he had.
