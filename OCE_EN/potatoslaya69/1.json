But I was playing well in Silver 4 preseason. The first game I lost and i was put into Iron 2 wtf?? Every game since then I have had the highest dmg or been close to it but y tf am I an entire elo bracket below what it I was. Like im playing with bronze ppl most of which are just lvl 30 and are new so y have I been forced onto this abyss because I lost my first placement game. Also I lost a placement since i dodged a troll who was going cleanse exhaust yuumi jng so thats nice. But why are placement so unfair just put in a random rank and it will be fairer. This is just my thoughts who knows i might just be a b4 scrub","replies":[{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2020-01-13T09:43:47.250+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"The start of the new ranked season always comes with a soft MMR reset.

There are some things that will mitigate this drop, like climbing substantially in preseason, but even in such cases those players will still mostly place a little lower.\n\nNaturally, this applies to everyone, so you could be playing with all the same people who were in S4 with you last season, but all the visible ranks will have dropped until you settle back into your true rank.\n\nThis soft reset is applied essentially to ensure that everyone is where they belong, particularly those who go long periods without playing. Those who belong in their end of season rank will climb back pretty quickly. Those who have dropped off a bit by habit/rust/etc will remain a little lower until they brush up on their skills.\n\nThat first game placement rank is always a little jarring, but that's becasue it's substantially lower than what you are expected to reach in placements. It's the absolute minimum rank you can achieve.","replies":[{"poster":"Chopnblok","date":"2020-01-13T23:28:08.920+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Ninox,realm=OCE,application-id=FjGAIbRv,discussion-id=UIixgNEY,comment-id=0002,timestamp=2020-01-13T09:43:47.250+0000)\n>\n> The start of the new ranked season always comes with a soft MMR reset.

I pushed during pre-season into Gold 3 from Bronze 2 and last season I placed Silver 4, after I did my placements start of this season guess where it placed me, Silver 4. What I'm hearing is that there is actually no point in trying in pre-season because when the new season starts the placement system will just place you back to the similar rank you where at end of last season.\n\nPre-season is the perfect time to troll since it's meaningless to improving your MMR.","replies":[{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2020-01-14T01:55:27.964+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"As I said, most people drop about a tier from their end of season rank. The fact that you got placed *in* your end of season rank means your MMR climbed substantially over the pre-season period. That is an accomplishment that the majority of people do not achieve.\n\nIt applies to everyone, so a lot of those people in visible Silver 4 with you now are people who were Gold last season.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Exarch Leona","date":"2020-01-13T04:10:24.805+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Was G2 last season, ended s3 1LP despite going 8-2 (or 7-3, cant remember, lotta wins)\nCan confirm rito have goofed this up (like multiple other things)","replies":[{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2020-01-13T09:48:10.026+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"That applies to everyone, such is the nature of a soft reset.
