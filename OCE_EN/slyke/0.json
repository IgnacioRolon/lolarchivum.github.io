In light of this, I will be getting a VPN and routing my internet traffic through it.\n\nBut this is a problem for when playing League, as my ping will skyrocket, and I want this VPN to always be on.\n\nMy solution to this is to have a list of \"trusted\" IP addresses that will not go through the VPN and instead use my normal internet connection. Basically all traffic will go through the VPN, except when that traffic is bound for any of the IPs listed (if anyone&#039;s interested in how I&#039;m going to do this, I&#039;ll explain in an edit).\n\nSo, I need a list of all the IP addresses of the gaming servers that we use in OCE. I don&#039;t care if the client doesn&#039;t go through the VPN, I&#039;m only interested in keeping my ping down. May ask this on reddit too if no one replies here.","replies":[{"poster":"HORSE OF FORCE","date":"2015-03-27T08:31:51.873+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"They're pretty mysterious when it comes to revealing the exact URLs/IP addresses accessed by aspects of the game, but after some rummaging through the game files here's what I found:\n\nl3cdn.riotgames.com *Supposedly the \"DownloadURL\"*\nprod.oc1.lol.riotgames.com *host*\nchat.oc1.lol.riotgames.com *xmpp_server_url*\nhttps://lq.oc1.lol.riotgames.com  *lq_uri*\nhttps://ekg.riotgames.com *ekg_uri*\nhttp://frontpage.oce.leagueoflegends.com/$localeCode/client/landing *lobbyLandingURL, again, I don't know exactly how much you want separated*\nhttp://spectator.oc1.lol.riotgames.com:80/observer-mode/rest/featured *featuredGamesURL*\nhttp://www.w3.org/2000/09/xmldsig# *Signature xmlns*\nhttp://www.w3.org/TR/2001/REC-xml-c14n-20010315 *CanonicalizationMethod Algorithm*\nhttp://www.w3.org/TR/xmldsig-core#rsa-sha1 *SignatureMethod Algorithm*\nhttp://www.w3.org/TR/2001/REC-xml-c14n-20010315 *Transform Algorithm*\nhttp://www.w3.org/2001/04/xmlenc#sha256 *DigestMethod Algorithm*\nhttp://uri.etsi.org/01903/v1.1.1# *Object xmlns:xades*\nhttp://www.w3.org/TR/2001/REC-xml-c14n-20010315 *Transform Algorithm*\nhttp://ns.adobe.com/air/application/3.7 *application xmlns*\n\nAnd it uses ports 2038,  2099, 8088.
