If you take a look at passives that require death (namely Karthus and Kog'Maw) you'll notice they don't have cooldowns. Secondly, since his passive requires him to die Sion would be giving his opponent gold and experience from his death in order to use his passive, which is only useful if he manages to kill someone else. It's pretty easy to get away while his passive is activating so it becomes useless.","replies":[{"poster":"IngÃ©nue","date":"2015-02-23T02:28:52.474+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"TL;DR CC=GG","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"SkarSkarSkarner","date":"2015-02-23T02:20:02.431+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=ShadowWing99,realm=NA,application-id=FjGAIbRv,discussion-id=gKJYoQto,comment-id=,timestamp=2015-02-22T19:47:14.555+0000)\n>\n> Sion can die over and over again but people almost try to get killed early so as to use his passive.
