We expected to get bronze, but not quite that low, especially when one of the last games we had lost was against plat and gold players.\r\nJust curious if someone could explain how team placements actually work to me, and how winning didnt seem to affect anything\r\nCheers\r\nZyv","replies":[{"poster":"UnicornBaconFat","date":"2015-06-11T07:01:39.672+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The other thing is that you can keep disbanding and remaking the team if you so please","replies":[]},{"poster":"Exhausted","date":"2015-06-10T00:49:27.208+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Understand the ranks work abit differently in ranked 5's and you'll find it easier to climb is you win more..\n\n\ndon't look at the rank, its not whats important mate.\n\nwhat is important is that you have a team of 5 people who enjoy playing together and will grow as a team.\n\n\nHave fun mate","replies":[]}]}
