The only other thing i can think of is that my Norton Antivirus is being decidedly overzealous, but i haven&#039;t had a problem with it until yesterday.\n\nCheers folks and will update after repair.\n\nEdit: Repair fixed it! #Golden{{item:3157}} ","replies":[{"poster":"Riot Cochese","date":"2015-07-09T23:35:48.979+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Glad the repair fixed you up mate!","replies":[{"poster":"zyv","date":"2015-07-10T08:55:38.010+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yeah, it was weird that it stopped working, but \"if it's fixed, don't f--k with it\" is the motto im'a go with","replies":[]}]}]}
