Im'a link a screenshot of my task-manager's processes tab which has *three*, count 'em, **three ** \"running\" **League of Ledgends.exe** processes. Thats very impressive if i do say so myself.\r\nAll because i tried to exit, after the first firewall error failed to achieve anything by pressing reconnect, and restart the client.\r\nJust looking for some help, not even mad about the leaver buster i now have...
