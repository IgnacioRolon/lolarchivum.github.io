I dont know why but i have always been a mean person. all through school i was verbally abusive towards people and its part of my attitude. I find however that players who go 0-16 and are clearly trolling get no punishment and yet when i rage i get chat restrictions and bans. sure i shouldnt rage because its not helping the situation but i personally believe 0-16 is worse than me saying \"ur fken bad\". i just think the overall system is flawed and needs looking at. also the fact that 12vies come onto an online game expecting not to get flamed? like really?","replies":[{"poster":"Pretz","date":"2015-01-11T03:11:35.128+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"just honestly surprised that you got your end of season rewards","replies":[]},{"poster":"Project Xayah","date":"2015-01-06T00:58:32.021+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Just because someone else breaks the rules doesn't mean you can break the rules. Report and move on, by raging at them you're giving them the response they want, which is attention, if you just ignore them and report them Riot will hand out punishments where due (and not to you).
