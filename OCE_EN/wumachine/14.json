It just seems like a bad idea to try to 1v1 her as melee at all unless you are someone like yi or fizz or akali.","replies":[{"poster":"KingDinger","date":"2015-01-15T01:27:15.716+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"it scales with boots tier. so i think that just means tier 2 boots of any type give the same jump range. \n\nnot like it matters. she isnt overpowered. she is just good at kiting people with no way to get on top of her and 2 shot her. but wait, league of gap closers....almost anyone can get on her no worries...","replies":[{"poster":"Wumachine","date":"2015-01-15T02:03:56.343+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"\"but wait, league of gap closers....almost anyone can get on her no worries...\"\n\nno, almost no one can get on her, because once that gap closer has been used, there is nothing stopping her from kiting back with her passive, most champs have a gap closer with a cd around the 10 second mark, kalista's is an instant cooldown.","replies":[{"poster":"KingDinger","date":"2015-01-15T06:37:22.977+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"she gets cut in half by like...anyone that isnt a tank...and anyone that isnt a tank will have a gap closer enough that they can cut her in half.","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Rok","date":"2015-01-15T01:19:47.362+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"{{champion:1}} {{champion:57}} {{champion:13}} {{champion:44}}","replies":[{"poster":"Wumachine","date":"2015-01-15T02:05:41.419+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"i've seen kalista's that barely survive the burst from annie yet just kite her back and kill her.
