Being reported by a player who has been reported themselves does not count as much as a player reporting you who has a clean record.\n\nIn addition to that, you can only be perma-banned after a red reviews your case. Any ban you get from reports would only be sort ones, so hopefully you can just wait it out.\n\nIf you get banned, you can't wait it out and you believe that it's for no reason, then immediately send a ticket to support explaining the situation.","replies":[]}]}
