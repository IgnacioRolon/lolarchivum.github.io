Lke what they did with veigar stun. So instead of popping out of nowhere instantly, add and animation where she throws the teddy bear and it transforms into tippers mid flight.\n\nI actually really like that idea as well. I hate playing against Annie's because it's not like an Amumu or Sej ult you can dodge it just pops up when she gets near you.  I don't really see Annie support anymore, not since her stun got nerfed ages back, and when I do see it it doesn't tend to so well unless she shreds her lane.\nStill love Annie though, her Snow skin is awesome\n{{champion:1}}","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"BarryButcher","date":"2015-04-11T05:21:15.261+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"This change would only really hurt Annie support.
