I won 7 in my placements (S4) and got placed in Bronze 2. Similarly, I have friends who only won 5 and got placed in Silver 3. By this logic, I think the ELO of opponents/teammates has a significant effect on your placement. \n\nYou could try to raise the stakes of your placements by playing off-peak: theoretically you could go 7/3 playing in peak times (maximum low-ELO players available for MM'ing) and get placed in Bronze; or go 5/5 playing off-peak (less low ELO players available; better chance of playing with higher ELO players) and get placed in Silver. The logic behind this is that you gain more ELO for beating higher-ELO players - say Silver, and gain less ELO for beating lower-ELO players - say Bronze. The same applies to losing: you're more likely to lose against Silver than Bronze and this is reflected in ELO losses. \n\nTL;DR: The odds are in your favour playing against higher ranked opponents in your placements. It's who you play not necessarily how many you win that determines your rank.\n\nI haven't tested this theory and ultimately your placements all come down to chance. But hopefully this gives you a little head start and possibly a silver border next season. I'd be interested to hear WHEN people played their placements and if this affected their starting ELO..?","replies":[{"poster":"JasonWazza","date":"2015-06-29T11:03:40.448+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":">It's hard to say.
