Not only have you exhibited a negative attitude throughout the game (consistently declaring that you don't care about the outcome or the team) and directed abuse towards other players, mostly those on your team from the look of it (such as name calling, attacking others for their internet connection), you've also used a few terms that cover  much more serious areas, such as suicide encouragement (telling someone to \"kill themselves\" is *never* acceptable) and what I'm going to call \"disability abuse\" (using terms like \"retard\" and \"autism\" as a way to insult people is *not* acceptable).\n\nRegardless of your reasons for acting in such a manner, you are on *very* thin ice and will need to change your behaviour over the next couple of weeks if you want to retain access to the account. I'd highly recommend you go find something to put all that aggression and frustration into, an outlet that will help you deal with it in a productive manner rather than you simply being a *[expletive deleted]* to other people both in-game/online and IRL.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Roguestoney","date":"2017-11-01T22:57:45.575+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Another keyboard warrior...","replies":[{"poster":"Swolefy","date":"2017-11-02T10:47:24.223+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":3,"body":"Me >> your IRL lol don't keyboard warrior me","replies":[{"poster":"Roguestoney","date":"2017-11-02T19:09:13.903+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Sure thing bud ðŸ™ƒ","replies":[{"poster":"Swolefy","date":"2017-11-02T22:37:20.877+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"***","replies":[{"poster":"Roguestoney","date":"2017-11-03T02:54:13.446+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Sorry i don't use instagram.
