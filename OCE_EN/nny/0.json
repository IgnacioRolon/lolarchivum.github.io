Confirmed by Riot support. Only 4 lines from one game transcript nothing else. Happy to provide proof of support ticket and have a Riot employee confirm.\n\n> : enjoy your solo lane fella\n> : I don&#039;t need to support a flamer\n> : but I am happy to be out of this game \n> : i'll ff for you\n\n( Can't insert screenshot of support conversation this was included in )\n\nSo by in the first two lines telling the flamer I wasn&#039;t putting up with them and the second two lines telling a perfectly calm and rational player that I would be glad to be out of this game and would /ff to their surrender vote so I&#039;m clearly verbally toxic and in need of a 25 game chat ban restriction and my honor dropping to level 0.\n\nIf you are thinking surely that&#039;s not right and ridiculously harsh you&#039;ll be glad to know as per the reply I got in the ticket &#039;Unfortunately, I have already double-checked with my colleagues from the Player Behavior team before sending you my last reply. I am afraid that the suspension was rightfully applied by our system&#039;\n\nMoral of the story. If there is a flamer in your game wishing you and your family death as so happened in this game. Don&#039;t type anything at all on your keyboard. Don&#039;t interact with other people on your team, just soft int, you&#039;ll never get banned for that.\n\nEDIT: As per requested I have included the screenshots from the in game client and the entire support conversation.\n\nhttps://imgur.com/a/RufXD","replies":[{"poster":"LevvyLeviticus","date":"2018-04-06T03:56:36.445+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":1,"body":"instant feedback is actual bullshit don't worry","replies":[{"poster":"NNY","date":"2018-04-06T08:27:39.563+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"I am not sure about that but I am sure that it is ridiculously overturned and Riot support just ignoring the issue sucks.","replies":[{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2018-04-06T11:33:40.901+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Upload your screenshots, I'd be curious to see the full back and forth.\n\nSupport have a high workload and very little time, the result is that most people get generic responses to generic questions.

Don't get your hopes up.\n___\n\n> These were placed on the account due to the consistent trend of negative behaviour in your recent games.\n\nIn other words, this game was the straw that broke the camel's back. Yours is not a case where it is a single instance of severe negativity, rather a case of consistent low level of negativity that has been consistently racking up reports and negative marks on your account.\n___\n\n> we do not tolerate negative behaviour of any kind, including retaliating to toxic behaviour int he same manner\n\nYou bring up a lot how you were flamed, but you too were flaming. Does that not put you on the same level? If you would want to see them punished for flaming, would you not then be held to the same standard?\n\nIt doesn't matter who starts it, you're creating a negative experience for others by continuing it. More-so by actively firing back. You are being held responsible for *your* actions. The actions of the other party aren't relevant to your punishment, and they'll be held accountable for their actions in due time.\n___\n\n> Being toxic doesn't mean necessarily only swearing or cursing.\n\nI'm not sure how relevant this is to you specifically, but given you seem to feel your behaviour was not toxic I feel it's worth mentioning. You don't have to swear to be toxic.\n\nThe majority of that chat log, your purpose appears to be abusing the Jhin. No communication, just \"you suck Jhin and you should feel bad\". Was the Jhin an ass? Maybe, but you're being an ass here too, and consequentially you were held to the same standards.\n___\n\n> your last restriction just ended recently\n\nSo basically, you got a chat restriction, and almost immediately after finishing it went right back to being negative. The system is understandably more sensitive to the behaviour of those with recent punishments. You've already used up any leeway you might have had for a positive or neutral history, and unless you get your account back in good standing that will remain the case.\n___\n\n> I will highlight only a few things\n\nYou seem to have taken those four lines the agent provided you with as them saying \"this is the only instance of toxicity in your log\" when really I think you'll find the intent was closer to \"this is representative of the consistent and continued toxicity in the rest of your log\".\n\nThey weren't saying you were only toxic for four lines, they were saying those four lines are indicative of the rest of you log. If they highlighted everything negative in your log, they'd be giving you almost your entire log back, and that would be rather meaningless.\n\nYou even appear to take shots at your top laner at one point, a player who seems like they just want to get on with the game, but instead are having to babysit you because you can't seem to just mute the Jhin and play the game until you can report him, and instead insist on ensuring the destruction of the experience for the rest of your team as well.\n___\n\n> I...tried quite consciously to improve my behaviour\n\nAnd yet you received a second restriction so soon after the first ended. It's only a chat restriction, essentially a warning of your behaviour not the end of the world and not the end of your account. Perhaps you could consider instead that the steps you have taken were clearly not enough, and given that you are on thin ice you need to be much more careful about your interactions.\n\nIf you can't handle when chat turns negative, because let's be honest, eventually you'll have a game where it will, then just mute everyone when you get in. If you know that you will fall into negativity then why let it happen, and ruin not only your experience but that of the rest of your team?\n___\n\n>Rather than flaming...rather than complaining...focus on the game.\n\nIt's solid advice. Flaming doesn't help you in any way. \n\nIt doesn't relieve stress, because you know they're going to fire back and you're just fuelling the flames. It doesn't give them 'what they deserve' because I guarantee you a stranger flaming on the internet doesn't give a rat's ass about your opinion of them. It doesn't help you play better because it only distracts you. It doesn't help your team because it just frustrates them. It certainly doesn't help your account.\n\nThere is literally no benefit to you to fire back at anyone. No benefit to being negative. So why continue? Everyone gets frustrated sometimes, and everyone lashes out sometimes. I won't pretend I've never had a toxic game because that would just be a lie, but you've been negative consistently enough to get two punishments in close succession.\n___\n\n>while the player who was actually toxic... gets off scot free\n\nDid they? How would you know exactly? Riot certainly doesn't give you any information on actions taken against other accounts, and the one notification that tells you when you contributed to a punishment is both limited and unreliable. You have no way of knowing that they were not punished. They will be held accountable for their actions same as you.","replies":[{"poster":"NNY","date":"2018-04-07T06:49:36.947+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"I know you're trying to help but I'll be honest I feel you didn't even really read the chat log I posted.

I went to another lane and still tried to win the game. Didn't threaten anyone, tried to explain that if I didn't help top I wouldn't be playing to my best and would be behind in game.","replies":[{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2018-04-07T07:15:47.880+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":">used bit & pieces to fit your narrative.\n\nI used the bits and pieces I felt best illustrated why you were punished.

If you've been accumulating negative history on your account, but none previously had been enough to push you into a punishment, those games would not be included.

I read your chat log. If I was on your team that game you&#x27;d be getting reported along with the Jhin.\n\nLook each to their own and that's okay but I feel that is an unrealistic standard from my 5 years in League. You must be reporting at least 2-3 people every game you're in. I feel if the standard you hold was held to account, 95% of the population would be banned. There is a Riot tool tip that encourages trash talk. You have popular streamers even notable ones given coverage by official Riot employees with view ship in the 100 of thousands that can yell into their screen 'Kill Yourself' but it's okay because they didn't type it. If you are going to have a punishment system in place it needs to be fair and equivalent. \n \n> Not necessarily.

In that all games in which this was demonstrated were included in the in game client so I don't believe/understand why this was the case. Nor could it be as I hadn't really typed at all since the first restriction.\n\n> https://i.imgur.com/DCzh911.jpg\n\nAgain seems to be an issue, we obviously have far different expectations and understanding of what flaming is. It's impossible for us to discuss this point if you put what's there on par with what I would consider flaming, not to mention actual abuse about death wishes. Again all that was in discussion with a player that actually was agreed that Jhin messed up. \n \n> Not immediately no, from what support had said it sounded like it was much more recent. It doesn't change the fact that you were negative in chat that game, and seemingly negative in gameplay as well, since regardless of your qualms with the adc you messed up the top laner and possibly others as well by invading their lanes when they weren't prepared for you.\n\nSo what you are saying is regardless of situation or the people I am playing with in a normal game I need to stick to an accepted meta ?\n\nDo I need to give approval for my jg to gank my lane or take cs and if they don't get it, is it reasonable for me to report them ? Do I need to give approval for top lane to teleport and take kills bot lane ? \n \n>?? What I said was there is no benefit to flaming, I never said noone cared. You hurt the experience of everyone in that game when you flame AND yourself. It doesn't help your team because it just frustrates them\n\n You had said _**\"It doesn't give them 'what they deserve' because I guarantee you a stranger flaming on the internet doesn't give a rat's ass about your opinion of them. It doesn't help you play better because it only distracts you\"**_ It may have been worded poorly but this is what I was referring to. \n\n>You were punished for your behaviour, not his. Deflecting blame onto someone else for *your* actions isn't going to get you very far. Whatever someone else, did, doesn't make it ok for you to sit there complaining and screwing your team over, when you could have just muted the Jhin and played the game.\n\nThis was never at it's core about 'wah he did worse than me I need to know he was punished as well' It has always been about the fact that I feel that the ban in context of what was being said is grossly overtuned. If I received a 25 game chat restriction for what I said. Then the person wishing death on me and my family should be permanently banned from the game. Who knows maybe they were but judging from my experience of repeat offenders, I highly doubt it. I still firmly believe my punishment in the context of what I see go on in NEARLY EVERY SINGLE GAME of League is egregious.","replies":[{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2018-04-07T08:43:12.375+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"> Look each to their own and that's okay but I feel that is an unrealistic standard from my 5 years in League.\n\nI think we'll have to agree to disagree here. I'm not saying your chat is the worst I've ever seen, cause it's *very* far from it, but you also don't have the worst punishment, only a 25 game chat restriction.\n\n> This I don't understand, as I said previously I have received a chat restriction before. In that all games in which this was demonstrated were included in the in game client\n\nI say this because I've seen it before, where someone gets a *relatively* mundane chat log as the final straw but their account has been accumulating reports and negative history for weeks. I don't know if this is specifically the case with your account, but given what the agent said I suspect it to be.\n\n> Again seems to be an issue, we obviously have far different expectations and understanding of what flaming is. \n\nFlaming is obviously something that is a matter of degree, and there are people on all ends of the spectrum as to what they would consider flaming and what they wouldn't. I don't think we're going to see eye to eye here, the best I can offer is that Riot has to find a middle ground. They have a difficult job finding the medium that pleases as many people as possible, since they'll never please everyone.\n\nYour chat is far from the worst out there, but to display that negativity game after game is going to stack against you. Like I said though, I don't know if that is specifically the case here, I only strongly suspect.\n\n> So what you are saying is regardless of situation or the people I am playing with in a normal game I need to stick to an accepted meta ?\n\nNot at all. I've roamed early when I've had an ass for an ADC, I'm not blaming you for wanting to get out of the lane, but putting the burden of another champion and leeched experience on your top lane without their acceptance, refusing to consider *their* experience and then seemingly asking people to then report them as well is pretty dang bm. Perhaps I'm assuming too much but it sounded like you stayed in top lane for quite a while, not just for a gank.\n\nYou could have roamed, you could have passively supported the Jhin until 6 or whenever the point was when you weren't desperate for experience etc etc. Instead you just dumped all your problems on someone else who had nothing to do with the reason for them in the first place.\n\n> It may have been worded poorly but this is what I was referring to.\n\nMy point was if someone is flaming you they won't care about you flaming them back, it's what they want so it won't get you anywhere good with them. Other people (namely the rest of your team) certainly still care.\n\n> I still firmly believe my punishment in the context of what I see go on in NEARLY EVERY SINGLE GAME of League is egregious.\n\nThe root of your issue. Admittedly somewhere in the discussion I lost site of that. \n\nPersonally, I feel that in the context of what the support agent has said which strongly indicates a consistent and culminating history of negative behaviour, and given that you have had a previous punishment, the restriction was valid. If it was this log on it's own as a first offence, I would feel differently about that.\n\nI would recommend following that ticket up with support and asking them specifically about the negative history on your account and how that contributed to your punishment, because I feel that is what has pushed you over in this case.\n\n___\n\n>Look for better or worse I am not a robot\n\nNoone expects you to be. Everyone has a toxic game every once in a while. For most reasonable people that aren't spouting hate speech or \"kys\" it's a matter of consistency more than severity that will see them punished or otherwise. If your negativity wasn't in some way consistent I have significant doubts you would have been punished for this.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"NNY","date":"2018-04-07T08:23:17.313+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Also just a side note, you mentioned \n\n>  Because you can't seem to just mute the Jhin and play the game until you can report him, and instead insist on ensuring the destruction of the experience for the rest of your team as well\n\nLook for better or worse I am not a robot, if someone flames me and/or goes so far as to wish death on me and my family.
