I'm continuously losing games due to people making poor decisions. Or their just bad. Granted i have my bad games etc. And i'm not blaming my team as it is me as well. But it's so hard to rank up nowadays. Especially when your at the lower elos (Iron, Bronze, Silver) legit impossible to climb as you always will have that player that will be horrible and need much more help.\r\n\r\nI'm just so over losing games. I play well but we lose anyways coz nobody gets the objectives. their just either kill hungry or just have poor skills","replies":[]}
