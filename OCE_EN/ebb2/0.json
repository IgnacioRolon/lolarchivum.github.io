Right now however, he's being supressed by terrible base numbers that force him into possibly the most sink-or-swim playstyle of any assassin, since he lacks the base damages to make a comeback. He needs alot of thought and finetuning into finding an adequate solution, something that gives more counterplay, without gutting the utilities his identity is based around, and that will likely involve better counterplay around his stealth, such as a clown indicator when Shaco is stealthed within vision range for example. Giving opponents more counterplay options will give a bit more leeway to put more base damage back into his kit.\n\nHe's just about the only premeditated assassin left in league bar the infamous teemo and I really don't want to see that leave league.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Broken Scripts","date":"2019-07-06T02:53:11.909+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The top Shaco players have no issue with him.
