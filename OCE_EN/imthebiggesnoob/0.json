When I tried to reconnect to the game, the whole client once again crashed and forced me to finally completely restart my computer, when I completely finished this process and logged back onto league as fast as I could, my team had surrendered and I was greeted with a leave buster queue for RIOT&#039;s fault. I wanted to justify why do people get an obnoxious 20 minute leave buster queue for five games, (in total 100 minutes) when it was riot&#039;s client which was at fault, I admit I have afk&#039;d in a previous game due to personal things but why riot, why do we have to be punished for your poorly executed client","replies":[{"poster":"Wuks","date":"2017-04-19T21:40:29.126+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I, along with thousands of others, have been using the client over the past few months since the Alpha and Beta testing ended. The client itself is actually more consistent than the old client, especially with the phasing out of Adobe Air. Individuals' interaction with the new client and their computers, however, may be another story. LeaverBuster is in place to ensure that anyone who is encountering issues with the new client resolves the issues expediently rather than allowing the issue to persist and causing unfair matches in the games that are left.
