Does anyone know if the damage that is being diverted to Rammus applies Rammus&#039; w to reflect it back to the attacker? What are your thoughts on keystones for Rammus thus far?","replies":[{"poster":"Tele","date":"2015-11-14T21:29:52.656+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"A tip for this patch, when wondering what tank keystone to take, always go Bond of Stone. 4% damage reduction by itself is broken and the buff to 8% makes it insane. It's going to be nerfed soon though, when it is I'd probably recommend strength of ages.","replies":[{"poster":"Zaps","date":"2015-11-16T04:51:45.705+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I have a feeling that it'll still be worth taking Bond of Stone on any \"true\" tank, mostly because the whole aim of your gameplay in the lategame is to mitigate damage on your allies - and that mastery is able to do that pretty significantly even if the enemy is able to bypass you and hit your carries.  \n\nI mean, 8% of all of your allies HP is likely to be more than 300HP (8% of 2khp = 160HP per champion). Even if that was reduced to 4%, it's probably still more than 300HP. That's totally ignoring your own ability to tank being enhanced. Plus, there's a not-neglibile turn on time for Strength of the Ages as well... \n\nI think Bond of Stone might be stronger after the change on those who are likely to build into a bit more damage than full tanks like Rammus.","replies":[{"poster":"Tele","date":"2015-11-16T05:38:09.762+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey Zaps do you know something we don't? Maybe I misunderstood but, the current nerf on the PBE is 4% down to 2%, but still 8% next to an ally. I think it makes sense since people are taking it in solo lanes to out tank people. \n\nDid you accidentally confirm 8% down to 4%? :D","replies":[{"poster":"Zaps","date":"2015-11-16T08:41:28.502+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"No, I'm just making guesses like everyone else. I'm nowhere remotely close to the teams that work on balance - I work as a Live Service Data Analyst!\n\nI'm only working on a worst case assumption of where that could end up being in the realm of logic (i.e. leaving the ratio the same as it is on live now) - to point out just how strong Bond of Stone is compared to Strength of the Ages.

I wanted it to be but in the end, it's 300 health vs 8% dmg reduction in fights, and you have to sit and farm to get even that 300. Ofc if you're behind or have been ganking a lot then just maxing it out is gonna be hard. I feel that unless they tweak Strength of the Ages, Bond of Stone is going to be the better choice for a while.","replies":[]}]}
