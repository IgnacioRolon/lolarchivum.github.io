I checked every other server, they&#039;ve also disabled him.\r\nBringing me to my question:\r\n&#039;Is (insert item / champion here) disabled because a certain server has reported a bug with (insert item / champion here)?&#039;\r\n\r\nThank you for answering!","replies":[{"poster":"Riot Cochese","date":"2015-07-10T05:37:55.085+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"It's definitely painful to not be able to play one of your favourite champions and we don't take this lightly. We publish League of Legends around the world, and we aim to patch in each region, as close to the same time as possible. Meaning most regions get the same patch within 24hours. \n\nThis is great for our players, because everyone wants to play with the latest updates, content, and bug fixes, as soon as possible. Sometimes though, we do introduce a game breaking bug, and in the best interest of fair play, we disable that champ. In the case of Zed, the bug was discovered on one region, but every region that has the new patch (most, including Oceania) would be affected as well.\n\nThat is why you see Zed currently disabled in multiple regions. We are currently working on a fix, and we want to have Zed playable as soon as possible. We will update here on the boards, when this is ready.\n\nI hope that answers your question, but feel free to hit me up with any follow up questions.","replies":[{"poster":"JasonWazza","date":"2015-07-10T17:15:01.157+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"A question about the bugs, why don't you just publish what the bug actually was?","replies":[]},{"poster":"Iosua Bot","date":"2015-07-14T00:47:52.151+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"it does answer my question :D\nty","replies":[]},{"poster":"Chicken4dinner","date":"2015-07-10T06:00:13.847+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"What happened to zed?","replies":[{"poster":"proMINscuous","date":"2015-07-10T09:37:41.790+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I think he had a bug with his shadow","replies":[{"poster":"GoldenTomat0","date":"2015-07-10T09:40:14.804+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=proMINscuous,realm=OCE,application-id=Ntey9fRZ,discussion-id=9qoAFAFV,comment-id=000000000000,timestamp=2015-07-10T09:37:41.790+0000)\n>\n> I think he had a bug with his shadow\n\nit was with his q.\nif you q'd a minion wave, it would deal the same damage to the next wave.\nso if you killed a minion with your q, it wouldn't spawn and you'd instantly get the gold and xp for it.\nor at least that's what i was told.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}
