I&#039;m just wondering (knowing that it&#039;s a great idea) if it&#039;ll be an actual thing, cause that would be much appreciated and I&#039;d be happy!\r\n\r\n{{sticker:slayer-pantheon-thumbs}}","replies":[{"poster":"QAPLA","date":"2017-12-05T03:15:36.300+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"So  you only play 1 champ?
