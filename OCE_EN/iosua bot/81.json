Yes that&#039;s what I do when I&#039;m bored. And I found it very annoying that the only history behind LoL was found anywhere but on the League Of Legends website.\r\n\r\nSo what I want to know (or what I want) is if LoL is going to get a &#039;History&#039; category?\r\nI know that Riot made a timeline on LoL, but I really want something more than that, cause I just want to know more about something that I actually like (and sometimes hate).\r\n\r\nThanks very much if anyone replies, if not then just think about it. If there should be a &#039;History&#039; category, just like how there is a &#039;Universe&#039; category.\r\n{{sticker:slayer-pantheon-popcorn}}","replies":[]}
