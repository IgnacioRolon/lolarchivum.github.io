Because I know that LoL will be there, according to friends who are going.\r\nAlso the are some people that are going to cosplay there! Rooty Hill I believe where it&#039;s being held (NSW).\r\n\r\nNot only will LoL will be there, also there will be Manga, Anime and something called &#039;Maid Cafe&#039;, I&#039;m warned not to go into the Maid Cafe alone because it&#039;s very weird if you go in alone, seriously, you have a chick calling you &#039;Master&#039; or whatever you like, which kinda puts out the &#039;Maid&#039; part.\r\n\r\nAnyway main question: &quot;What events will Riot Games be holding for LoL @ Smash?&quot;\r\nAlso if you&#039;re going to Smash, or have gone before, please tell me what it&#039;s like! Because I&#039;m wanting to go, but seeing a Samoan there is quite weird, especially when your the ONLY Samoan there.\r\n\r\nTHANKS 4 YOUR COMMENTS (If there are any)","replies":[{"poster":"Maraudaur","date":"2015-07-17T03:15:23.368+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey Zen Bot,\n\nJust to clarify League of Legends/Riot Games will not be at Smash.
