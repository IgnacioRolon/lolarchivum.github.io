I was mid agasint a kat as ekko and as we were playing i asked for a gankl. my aatrox literally didn&#039;t do anything but i was like ok. I died as i got pressured and went back to lane. asked for a gank again and he still didnt do anything. Me and kat fought under my tower and she barely lived. Now aatrox wanted to do something and tried to get her. He failed then started to push my lane but not further engough to go into tower. I was like wtf, wut r u doing. thats trash. don&#039;t come to my lane only when im not there to only steal cs and push. he told me to stop feeding and  as thier renekton out of nowhere called me trash, garbo etc. Realizing how this game was going to turn out as i was the only person negative i was like f off or ill leave i don&#039;t want to deal with ur shit today. they and blitz spammed k and i left. like 2 mins later i realized that was a heat of the moment decsions and i recently left a game due to an actual real life event recently and i probably will get low prioirty if i stay afk. So I went back in and they basically all told me to leave. somehow aatrox died 3 times whitin that short peroid of time and I was like stop feeding aatrox. I then went back to playing and ingored everyone and responding to insults with a tradional goodfellas qoute tommy used to spam. Basically the game was going and i wound up being postive and our aatrox died 9 times. guess this dude got pissed and was like 1 v 1 me. I said no i got better things to do, i gotta finish my rank promo. Basically got taunted by the rest of the team and premade into doing the 1 v 1 which i proceeded to win. Shortly after I got a 2 week ban ntoficiation over this one game. I&#039;m, not a expert but after some research i found it should be  Chat restrictions, low priority queue, 3 day ban, 14 day ban then perma ban. I have gotten low priority q from leaver buster before, can&#039;t remeber if i ever had chat restrictions and im not sure what that even means. But I do know i never had a 3 day ban before. This is all based on one game too. I&#039;m pretty sure this is a instant feedback bug because it skipped like 9 steps. \r\n\r\nTDLR; I was toxic and got in trouble for it in one game. Over-punishment because of first incident in the recent memory. I dunno if riot is digging  up s3 stuff to put it agasint me.","replies":[{"poster":"SEKAI","date":"2017-04-22T13:44:25.882+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"This is OP's thread on NA.\n\nhttps://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/player-behavior-moderation/UeudexiP-one-game-instant-2-week\n\nStay tuned in for the updates there, if that's your thing.\n\n..........\n\nTo OP,\n\nUsually it needs to be pretty drastic use of words and such to get instant 2 week bans from a single match, you can always ask Riot Support to provide why exactly the system had decided to ban you which they will reply with chatlogs summary and stuff I believe. You can also request for an appeal through a support ticket too.\n\nThat said, since you're already on 14 days ban now, your next punishment will be a perma if you ain't careful. So I suggest you to stay very low for the time being in-game.","replies":[]}]}
