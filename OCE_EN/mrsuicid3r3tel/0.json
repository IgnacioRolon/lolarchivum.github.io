This is the lowest your rank can be once you are properly placed, so it'll only go up from there.  Only you can see this rank, it isn't public on your profile until you complete all 10 matches.","replies":[{"poster":"MrSuicid3R3tel","date":"2018-12-09T00:32:17.987+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"but usually we can see how many match we have to complete but in this case i can't see that.
