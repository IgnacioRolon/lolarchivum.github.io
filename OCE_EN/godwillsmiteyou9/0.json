Riot regularly update their bot detection system and quite a few of the accounts get banned, although because it is a profitable business, the people running the bots are continuously updating their scripts so they are one step ahead of detection. It's a pretty vicious cycle. \n\nYou and other players can do your part to assist Riot in their war against bots/botted accounts and report these accounts in the end of game screen under the 3rd party software option. Keep in mind that these punishments are permabans on first offence, however are not instant punishments. It may take a while for the ones you are seeing now to be punished, as bot bans usually come out in waves.","replies":[]}]}
