Nope Triple kill plz riot fix this {{champion:420}} she is way to strong and her scalings are ridiculous! \r\n\r\nMoving on to {{champion:133}} this champion with her no cd ultimate and increased speed is ridiculous because she can ult in then her passive will mark you then she will Q then passive again then E then passive again. This champion is so broken when in top lane because she will not let you farm and for you it will be a nightmare! Please just nerf her especially her Passive (Harrier)!","replies":[{"poster":"Ghazan","date":"2015-12-19T09:45:01.346+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"when she ults there will be a lot of tentacles, but they target the person hit by her w. so spread out when you gank her to be less likely to all get hit, or go in 1 after the other so she either ults late or the duration won't last for the full duration of the gank. quinns passive has a low cd and is only guranteed to mark you every time if youre alone in which case thats one of her strengths anyway as being an anti split pusher. just group up so she cant engage on u. plus her ult has like a 2sec channel which is interrupted my dmg so if u see her try to ult near u just aa her or whatever.  neither of these champs are that op ur just not thinking as to how to counterplay","replies":[]},{"poster":"ViolinMaker53","date":"2015-12-19T16:47:10.366+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"shes a natural tank top just crush her all game and snowball out","replies":[]}]}
