Maybe consider using a different font for the lyrics on screen and perhaps some sort of fade or blend effect on them so they are not so harsh also maybe try mashing up the song you used (which i do like that song) with some sounds from the cinematic's such as when you transitioned into jinx from the 'get jinxed video' a drop in the song was the perfect opportunity to use the sound effect of the bullets hitting the ground, just my two cents but i really did like what you put together","replies":[{"poster":"Omega Shenron","date":"2016-01-02T22:34:55.634+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"thank you i will try some of that on my next video","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Fitzky","date":"2016-01-02T11:53:23.749+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Nice montage collab, in my personal opinion I didn't like the song","replies":[{"poster":"Omega Shenron","date":"2016-01-02T12:08:00.374+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"finding music for montages is the hardest thing since everyone likes different things","replies":[{"poster":"Fitzky","date":"2016-01-02T12:16:10.435+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yea I guess :/","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Tele","date":"2016-01-02T11:45:57.896+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Good montage, song is a bit annoying, probably just me though.","replies":[]}]}
