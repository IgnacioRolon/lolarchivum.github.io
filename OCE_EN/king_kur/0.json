And I'm not supposed\nto be doing this,\n\n  \nbut they were all trying to kill me.\n\n  \nAnd if it wasn't for you...\n\n  \nI had to thank you.\nIt's just how I was raised.\n\n  \nThat was a little weird.\n\n  \n- I'm talking with a bee.\n- Yeah.\n\n  \nI'm talking to a bee.\nAnd the bee is talking to me!\n\n  \nI just want to say I'm grateful.\nI'll leave now.\n\n  \n- Wait! How did you learn to do that?\n- What?\n\n  \nThe talking thing.\n\n  \nSame way you did, I guess.\n\"Mama, Dada, honey.\" You pick it up.\n\n  \n- That's very funny.\n- Yeah.\n\n  \nBees are funny. If we didn't laugh,\nwe'd cry with what we have to deal with.\n\n  \nAnyway...\n\n  \nOan I...\n\n  \n...get you something?\n- Like what?\n\n  \nI don't know. I mean...\nI don't know. Ooffee?\n\n  \nI don't want to put you out.\n\n  \nIt's no trouble. It takes two minutes.\n\n  \n- It's just coffee.\n- I hate to impose.\n\n  \n- Don't be ridiculous!\n- Actually, I would love a cup.\n\n  \nHey, you want rum cake?\n\n  \n- I shouldn't.\n- Have some.\n\n  \n- No, I can't.\n- Oome on!\n\n  \nI'm trying to lose a couple micrograms.\n\n  \n- Where?\n- These stripes don't help.\n\n  \nYou look great!\n\n  \nI don't know if you know\nanything about fashion.\n\n  \nAre you all right?\n\n  \nNo.\n\n  \nHe's making the tie in the cab\nas they're flying up Madison.\n\n  \nHe finally gets there.\n\n  \nHe runs up the steps into the church.\nThe wedding is on.\n\n  \nAnd he says, \"Watermelon?\nI thought you said Guatemalan.\n\n  \nWhy would I marry a watermelon?\"\n\n  \nIs that a bee joke?\n\n  \nThat's the kind of stuff we do.\n\n  \nYeah, different.\n\n  \nSo, what are you gonna do, Barry?\n\n  \nAbout work? I don't know.\n\n  \nI want to do my part for the hive,\nbut I can't do it the way they want.\n\n  \nI know how you feel.\n\n  \n- You do?\n- Sure.\n\n  \nMy parents wanted me to be a lawyer or\na doctor, but I wanted to be a florist.\n\n  \n- Really?\n- My only interest is flowers.\n\n  \nOur new queen was just elected\nwith that same campaign slogan.\n\n  \nAnyway, if you look...\n\n  \nThere's my hive right there. See it?\n\n  \nYou're in Sheep Meadow!\n\n  \nYes! I'm right off the Turtle Pond!\n\n  \nNo way! I know that area.\nI lost a toe ring there once.\n\n  \n- Why do girls put rings on their toes?\n- Why not?\n\n  \n- It's like putting a hat on your knee.\n- Maybe I'll try that.\n\n  \n- You all right, ma'am?\n- Oh, yeah. Fine.\n\n  \nJust having two cups of coffee!\n\n  \nAnyway, this has been great.\nThanks for the coffee.\n\n  \nYeah, it's no trouble.\n\n  \nSorry I couldn't finish it. If I did,\nI'd be up the rest of my life.\n\n  \nAre you...?\n\n  \nOan I take a piece of this with me?\n\n  \nSure! Here, have a crumb.\n\n  \n- Thanks!\n- Yeah.\n\n  \nAll right. Well, then...\nI guess I'll see you around.\n\n  \nOr not.\n\n  \nOK, Barry.\n\n  \nAnd thank you\nso much again... for before.\n\n  \nOh, that? That was nothing.\n\n  \nWell, not nothing, but... Anyway...\n\n  \nThis can't possibly work.\n\n  \nHe's all set to go.\nWe may as well try it.\n\n  \nOK, Dave, pull the chute.\n\n  \n- Sounds amazing.\n- It was amazing!\n\n  \nIt was the scariest,\nhappiest moment of my life.\n\n  \nHumans! I can't believe\nyou were with humans!\n\n  \nGiant, scary humans!\nWhat were they like?\n\n  \nHuge and crazy. They talk crazy.\n\n  \nThey eat crazy giant things.\nThey drive crazy.\n\n  \n- Do they try and kill you, like on TV?\n- Some of them. But some of them don't.\n\n  \n- How'd you get back?\n- Poodle.\n\n  \nYou did it, and I'm glad. You saw\nwhatever you wanted to see.\n\n  \nYou had your \"experience.\" Now you\ncan pick out yourjob and be normal.\n\n  \n- Well...\n- Well?\n\n  \nWell, I met someone.\n\n  \nYou did? Was she Bee-ish?\n\n  \n- A wasp?! Your parents will kill you!\n- No, no, no, not a wasp.\n\n  \n- Spider?\n- I'm not attracted to spiders.\n\n  \nI know it's the hottest thing,\nwith the eight legs and all.\n\n  \nI can't get by that face.\n\n  \nSo who is she?\n\n  \nShe's... human.\n\n  \nNo, no. That's a bee law.\nYou wouldn't break a bee law.\n\n  \n- Her name's Vanessa.\n- Oh, boy.\n\n  \nShe's so nice. And she's a florist!\n\n  \nOh, no! You're dating a human florist!\n\n  \nWe're not dating.\n\n  \nYou're flying outside the hive, talking\nto humans that attack our homes\n\n  \nwith power washers and M-80s!\nOne-eighth a stick of dynamite!\n\n  \nShe saved my life!\nAnd she understands me.\n\n  \nThis is over!\n\n  \nEat this.\n\n  \nThis is not over! What was that?\n\n  \n- They call it a crumb.\n- It was so stingin' stripey!\n\n  \nAnd that's not what they eat.\nThat's what falls off what they eat!\n\n  \n- You know what a Oinnabon is?\n- No.\n\n  \nIt's bread and cinnamon and frosting.\nThey heat it up...\n\n  \nSit down!\n\n  \n...really hot!\n- Listen to me!\n\n  \nWe are not them! We're us.\nThere's us and there's them!\n\n  \nYes, but who can deny\nthe heart that is yearning?\n\n  \nThere's no yearning.\nStop yearning. Listen to me!\n\n  \nYou have got to start thinking bee,\nmy friend. Thinking bee!\n\n  \n- Thinking bee.\n- Thinking bee.\n\n  \nThinking bee! Thinking bee!\nThinking bee! Thinking bee!\n\n  \nThere he is. He's in the pool.\n\n  \nYou know what your problem is, Barry?\n\n  \nI gotta start thinking bee?\n\n  \nHow much longer will this go on?\n\n  \nIt's been three days!\nWhy aren't you working?\n\n  \nI've got a lot of big life decisions\nto think about.\n\n  \nWhat life? You have no life!\nYou have no job. You're barely a bee!\n\n  \nWould it kill you\nto make a little honey?\n\n  \nBarry, come out.\nYour father's talking to you.\n\n  \nMartin, would you talk to him?\n\n  \nBarry, I'm talking to you!\n\n  \nYou coming?\n\n  \nGot everything?\n\n  \nAll set!\n\n  \nGo ahead. I'll catch up.\n\n  \nDon't be too long.\n\n  \nWatch this!\n\n  \nVanessa!\n\n  \n- We're still here.\n- I told you not to yell at him.\n\n  \nHe doesn't respond to yelling!\n\n  \n- Then why yell at me?\n- Because you don't listen!\n\n  \nI'm not listening to this.\n\n  \nSorry, I've gotta go.\n\n  \n- Where are you going?\n- I'm meeting a friend.\n\n  \nA girl? Is this why you can't decide?\n\n  \nBye.\n\n  \nI just hope she's Bee-ish.\n\n  \nThey have a huge parade\nof flowers every year in Pasadena?\n\n  \nTo be in the Tournament of Roses,\nthat's every florist's dream!\n\n  \nUp on a float, surrounded\nby flowers, crowds cheering.\n\n  \nA tournament. Do the roses\ncompete in athletic events?\n\n  \nNo. All right, I've got one.\nHow come you don't fly everywhere?\n\n  \nIt's exhausting. Why don't you\nrun everywhere? It's faster.\n\n  \nYeah, OK, I see, I see.\nAll right, your turn.\n\n  \nTiVo.
