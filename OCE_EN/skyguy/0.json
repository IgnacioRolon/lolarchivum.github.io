It really was. Draven was already out in the backyard training area, throwing wooden axes onto the test dummies. Darius wanted a piece of the action. &ldquo;Maybe I could have a go?&rdquo; asked Darius. Draven replied, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know bro, this is some serious stuff. Are you sure you&rsquo;re Draven enough?&rdquo;. Without hesitation, Darius grabbed the wooden axe, throwing it in a horizontal motion, like a boomerang. The axe completely missed the target of course and came back to hit Darius in the face. Blood ran from a line of which the axe had hit Darius&rsquo; face. &ldquo;God dammit!&rdquo;. Darius began to call for his mother, who was in the kitchen preparing Noxian pancakes with a special syrup that Singed was distributing (It was completely poison free, Singed can make more than just deadly poisons). Darius didn&rsquo;t shed a tear whilst the blood was now pouring from the gaping hole, Noxus saw crying as being weak (excessive crying would later lead to banishment or in some cases death). Darius&rsquo; mother ran over to Darius, holding a tissue to the wound. The tissue filled with blood quickly, the wound was too large to go without stitching. Darius&rsquo;s mother (Deandra) ran to get singed&rsquo;s special blood clotter spray solution. The spray stung, but at the age of ten Darius was already taught how to handle immense amounts of pain. The solution stopped the bleeding, however, the scar remained&hellip; (Back to present). &ldquo;Ah, I remember now. You know, I think it was good that you threw that axe, you look a bunch more badass with the scar&rdquo;, responded Draven to Darius&rsquo; flashback being told. &ldquo;Whatever, want to go throw some hoops bro? The winner can be the Dunk-Master&rdquo;, Asked Darius. &ldquo;Oh yeah, bring it on!&rdquo;, retorted Draven... The game went on for 12 hours, but everyone knows who won...","replies":[]}
