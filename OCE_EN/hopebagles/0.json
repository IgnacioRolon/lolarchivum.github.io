THE ISSUE IS THAT IT IS DONE BY A FRAGGING BOT! \nWe use to have tribunal on NA when there was no OCE.\n\nThe tribunal was okay but if you just did what I use to and BAN EVERYONE. You would end up with a 80% rate. The bot on the other hand.. Only goes with key words.\nNot context. So lets say I ring my mate and I use LoL client to do it. Then he picks up the phone and I say \" Hey dip shit. How are going to eat dk today \" the bot is will automatically think this is toxic and ban me for it.\nBut with Tribunal and players doing the judgement. They won't ban me for it as it is just 2 mates giving shit to one another.\n\nToxic player's going by google since Riot has never nor will weight in on this so we have no real basic idea what toxic is.\nToxic in gameplay mechanics refers to something that in loosest terms \"is only fun when you play it, and totally unfun to play against.\" It usually refers to mechanics that have very very costly counterplay, or limited counterplay in general. When Eve could come up to you under incredibly fast movespeed with her R and stun you on the first hit from stealth, this is an example. You couldn't have the whole map pink warded all game, and you couldn't have oracles on the whole team all game.\n\nQuoted from [here](http://forums.na.leagueoflegends.com/board/showthread.php?t=4017082) as you can see for your self it was a player not Riot.\nSo the other issue is.. \nWHAT IS TOXIC? Just because someone said you are a joke.. Doesnt make it toxic. Heck if that was the case. Everytime someone said to me I was unskilled / Bad or just dumb. I would have them ban for toxic.\nSo really how do you stop something when you have no idea what it is.\n\n{{sticker:zombie-brand-mindblown}}","replies":[]}]}]}
