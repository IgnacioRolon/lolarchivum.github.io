You can kill the 3 back casters for a quicker push, or if an objective is coming up and i like to contest it, i reset the wave and kill of a single caster minion for a slow push. With the slow push you will have more minions collide with the tower at a later time compared to a smaller wave hitting the tower earlier. Since your fighting over an objective, more people tend to hang around it rather than resetting the wave. This means that while your fighting over an objective, your lane is pushing really slow at first which at first glance looks like its doing nothing, but over time it builds up unexpectedly which can make up for if you lose the objective.","replies":[{"poster":"Exhausted","date":"2014-12-23T00:20:02.322+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"This is also true.\n\nGLHF!","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Sulbatamol","date":"2014-12-22T09:43:55.183+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"if u wanna push the lane. u need to make sure u have at least 3+ more mage like looking minions (MLM) in ur minion wave compared to enemy minion wave.\n\nif u wanna freeze  lane or ur lane pushed to deny enemy from farming when enemy minions are pushing  (say when ur winning), take dmg from minions and make sure ur tower dosent attack them. just about when ur minion wave arrives, u hide in bush and come out again when ur minion and enemy minion start to attack each other so mitigate dmg from enemy minion.\n","replies":[]},{"poster":"Justify","date":"2014-12-22T07:28:01.604+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"yes bronze 5s cant do it i know","replies":[]}]}
