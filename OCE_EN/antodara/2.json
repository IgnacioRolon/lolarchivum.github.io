My MMR might be slighty high (which I don&#039;t get, I barely ever play against any teams that have higher than bronze) due to me winning norms a bit, but is there a reason i&#039;m dumped into Silver 3+ tier games for my 5v5 ranked promos? I just hit 30 yesterday, and went to ranked to try and better myself and learn how ranked play works, and I got put with really good players and couldn&#039;t really keep up due to not having really stuck to a champion In a specific lane that&#039;s good in ranked play. I&#039;ve always stuck with darius/nasus for top but i&#039;ve heard they&#039;re not good at ranked play and so I&#039;ve stayed away from them because I don&#039;t want to bring down my teammates because I have a bad pick.","replies":[{"poster":"JasonWazza","date":"2015-04-07T05:09:32.185+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You start Ranked with a silver 4 MMR, this is to make sure that people who are good but just starting ranked don't have to climb from bronze 5, but it means that newer players generally struggle with their first 3-6 games.","replies":[{"poster":"Antodara","date":"2015-04-07T06:02:16.321+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Oh ok awesome. I guess if I play what i'm comfortable with I could keep up a silver ranking, it's just i'm not used to the ranked atmosphere so I don't know if it's like normals where if you go in solo you spam \"TOP TOP TOP\" to get your lane and work it like that, or if everybody tries to be civil and hand lanes to whoever sounds like they have more experience with said lane and champ.\n\nAlso still working out matchups and which champs to ban (I was captain both of my ranked games..), and which champs to counter pick.","replies":[{"poster":"JasonWazza","date":"2015-04-07T06:17:40.612+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Pick order rules in ranked, while there are still dumbasses that think they can call whatever they want from whatever pick and get it, it's a general fact that pick order is the order that decides roles.\n\nAs for bans http://www.lolking.net/champions/ gives a general idea as to where champions sit and what's generally being banned, (for example, Sejuani is sitting in basically insta-ban right now)\n\nCounter picks don't mean much in lower elo, play the champ that you know over the champ that counters the other laners champ.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Wumachine","date":"2015-04-07T04:24:09.998+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"ah the noob trap, dont play ranked till you reach 700-1000 wins in normals","replies":[]},{"poster":"Saldean","date":"2015-04-06T15:32:22.100+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I think that you just explained your own problem there. In ranked, the competitive environment either creates the player to play seriously or not and that depends solely on them.  Since you have just said you hit level 30 yesterday I believe that you are not ready to play ranked yet. You told me what you play and that is top lane with nasus and darius however think of them that as bad picks to discourage yourself from picking your main champions and playing them. It's better being comfortable with a champion that is played 20-30 times than trying it once in a ranked game. Overall just practice and you will be fine to play ranked games for your provisional, be patient. :>","replies":[]}]}
