Sure, I can't expect my ult to finish, but it was never used to finish. It was always a lockdown and gapcloser sot hat my next two auto's would finish.\r\n\r\nVi is still great at clearing the jungle, and can gank like nobody's business. I suppose if Rito wants to say they're nerfing her and people stop picking/banning her i'm happy, but I feel she hasn't changed much. Which also makes me happy, I enjoy her play style.","replies":[{"poster":"BarryButcher","date":"2015-03-15T03:18:56.704+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"They only nerfed her to say \"hey look, we know Vi is annoying to play against, but we don't want to change her since we like her. So here are some nerfs that won't really change her at all\".\n\nI don't think Vi is any more overbearing to the game than a fed Zed or Fizz. Fizz and Nidalee, now there are 2 cancerous pieces of sht LOL","replies":[]},{"poster":"Mar3thyu","date":"2015-03-15T02:40:14.511+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"They only did this nerf because they think her kit and damage output is fine atm the reason they nerfed her ult was the damage it did early not many bruisers have a 200 damage lock on ult that can do aoe and I agree with the ms nerf as it will make her slower early so she does take a bit longer to get to a gank","replies":[]}]}
