He hits like a truck consistently throughout the game, and has a pretty decent kit for staying alive and chasing kills. I can&#039;t work his ult for the life of me, but I am enjoying the Spinning Axes mechanic. {{champion:119}}\r\n\r\nAnybody got any good videos/links they can post me to? I&#039;ve take a standard build of rushing {{item:1053}} and then {{item:1001}} , then buying a {{item:3031}} , finishing my {{item:3072}} , and then {{item:3035}} {{item:3006}} {{item:3046}} {{item:3046}} . This gets me some pretty good damage against squishies and allows me to fight tanks to death, albeit I would swap a PD for BORK if I need to fight a tank heavy team. This also allows for 90% crits, and the AWESOME thing about Draaaaaven&#039;s Q is that it can crit causing [tons of damage](http://s3.roosterteeth.com/images/ahwaffles51a817f125583.jpg).","replies":[{"poster":"JasonWazza","date":"2015-05-05T12:26:50.307+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Off the wiki\n\n>Critical strikes will not interact with Spinning Axe's bonus damage. \n\nMeaning the bonus damage doesn't crit.\n\nGenerally the aim for draven is to have a BF first back, otherwise a pickaxe, Life steal isn't necessary that early considering no one but Vayne (maybe twitch but i don't see them) builds lifesteal first.\n\nBuild is IE>BT>LW then your choice.","replies":[{"poster":"Antodara","date":"2015-05-05T12:49:57.504+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I just read that too. Ah well, guess i don't do AS much damage :c\n\nI was hitting somewhere in excess of 1.2k crits with Q's. It was ridiculous. I think his q somewhat works like Kaista's Martial Prowess too.","replies":[{"poster":"Jink","date":"2015-05-05T13:17:45.200+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"-","replies":[{"poster":"Antodara","date":"2015-05-05T13:26:59.297+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'm not entirely sure what that's directed at. His Q does sort of work like that. I've found by throwing my axe, then clicking somewhere to move in the split second afterwards, i'll go towards exactly where the axe will land.","replies":[{"poster":"McRuthless","date":"2015-05-05T22:48:03.902+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The axe landing position is determined by the where you're moving when it hits.","replies":[{"poster":"Antodara","date":"2015-05-06T01:22:59.098+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Excellent, so I was right, sort of. I'll need to rejig how I position a little bit now, Draaaaaven's pretty intense in micromanagement, if you don't have that Q up you don't generally have damage.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]}]}
