If Voice Comms were to be introduced, these factors really would make a majority of people turn off the voice function altogether reasonably quickly. Then you have a situation where half the team has muted comms and half the team is doing it. This causes further frustration and confusion from both players just due to the fact that not responding to calls may frustrate the voice players, and not responding to text/pings frustrating the other players. Until we can find a way to solve some player behaviour issues within the community it wouldn't be worth it to invest so much of Riot's resources into something which could be very easily a large miss. \n\nOne core form of communication really tells you a lot about the game is through the Smart Pings system. I've done a lot of lectures on communication in-game at the University of Auckland - LoL Club, and pairing a couple of short words with smart pings can communicate all you ever really need in a game. Such as pinging** Enemy Missing **(over your lane), **Danger **ping over the other lanes or direction believed to be headed in danger and then  type \"Care for __\" If noone is in your lane, spending 3 seconds or less typing and pinging that could be the difference of a double kill and could completely waste their time giving you an advantage. The reason I'm elaborate with multiple pings and chat is because it gives more information. \n1. Exactly who is missing\n2. Where they could potentially be going\n3. To play more careful\n\n If you're wanting to do voice chat, you can use a discord channel and invite people in the lobby. People who are **_invited _**tend to be nicer and less toxic than being forced into a chat with someone.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Ing√©nue","date":"2016-04-14T13:29:01.532+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Voice chat would be pretty difficult to implement at this stage of the game's development. \n\nHere are some immediate issues I see with your idea:\n\n* People are toxic and will flame, flame, flame (you're gonna end up muting 90% of players)\n\n\n* It is unbelievably skewed towards the assumption that everyone is gonna speak english. On most servers (OCE included), players come from a wide range of backgrounds and quite a few don't want to, or can't speak english. This could result in more flaming from teammates (e.g when I accidentally type in french in chat, people get really uppity and start saying they'll report me.) Voice chat would make thins like this so much worse. \n\n\n* Despite Riot making big steps towards making the league community less homophobic, racist and sexist, these are still pretty big themes when it comes to harassment. Even having a feminine summoner name, it opens me up to so much trash talk and creepers. Imagine this, but with voice chat when someone decides you sound like you fit the stereotype. \n\n[This ](https://ask.fm/RiotLyte/answers/130833690818)is what Lyte said a while back on the whole idea\n\nFor the meantime, play with 5 friends and use one of the comms out there. You can even have a discord server with your instant invite on copy-paste so you can invite randoms in your game to come talk (have tried, 10/10 would not recommend).","replies":[{"poster":"Rivalry","date":"2016-04-15T08:10:00.197+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"But people aren't going to be acting the same and you can have the option to talk or not? Think about how much time could do with this, you could also be temp banned from voice comms if you're too toxic? The language thing won't be a issue. People would stop treating others like monsters and actually speak to each other like humans, you could also reward players who lead their team to victory and communicate well and maybe adjust the honor system. Time does a lot to people, maybe it seems like it's impossible right now but it's really not and you need to do something to make oce competitive actually a competitive mode.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Rivalry","date":"2016-04-15T08:05:27.926+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Just add voice comms so the other 80% of people that are actually good at the game can climb to diamond, these people are impossible lol.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Knuuckles","date":"2016-04-14T15:33:22.204+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Let's give the most toxic game full of 12 year olds a voice communication tool, if you want Comms so bad get a pre made 5 and use ts","replies":[]}]}
