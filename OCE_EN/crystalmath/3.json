All I&#039;ve had lately are people that are pure salt and toxicness.i just don&#039;t feel like people should feel the need to gloat about making a good play and getting toxic because i made a good play or even worse explaining how bad i am at the game and why i should &quot;kill myself&quot; because i&#039;m a &quot;failed abortion&quot; and a &quot;excuse of a league player&quot;. i don&#039;t know if riot will ever do something about this but it really gets old dealing with it game after game\r\n\r\ni really do love league ............... theirs just no motivation to play anymore. i used to get so happy when i did something in my pre-thirty days but now i&#039;m just more worried that if i do something i&#039;m either gonna get flamed or laughed at for failing.\r\n\r\ni don&#039;t think this will actually help or do anything but it doesn&#039;t matter. i just think that people actually playing the game without the salt and the toxicness would be better than any new game feature that riot could add to this game \r\n\r\n- crystalmath       {{champion:1}}","replies":[{"poster":"JasonWazza","date":"2016-02-03T13:02:22.478+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":1,"body":"Just a thing i think you might enjoy doing\n\n/mute all","replies":[{"poster":"crystalmath","date":"2016-02-03T14:28:39.865+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"yeah but team communication can be a good thing","replies":[{"poster":"JasonWazza","date":"2016-02-03T17:21:08.337+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Honestly, if you have to just tell everyone your muting all, people should communicate by pings anyway, as spending any time typing is a waste.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"WE WUZ KINGZ","date":"2016-02-04T07:13:45.714+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"do premades?

Bronze 1 though, there's a whole bunch of low Silvers you get in your games that trash talk, and think they are so good at the game because they're not Bronze.\n\nWe all have periods of tilt too, sometimes I take the toxic talk too seriously, other times I can just laugh it off. Just mute the offending players if you feel that they are constantly hostile, not just a few toxic statements here and there.","replies":[]}]}
