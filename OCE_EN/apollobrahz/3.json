I&#039;m just wondering how meany reports dose one need in a. Single game to be noticed my the tribunal , I had written a long speech about why this perfect should had been reported  stating a few response like , the player did not have the intent to play the game , he just wanted to make us feel bad and he was calling the enemy team out to go kill him hell even some times he would just run into there bace and die by tower or champion . So what&#039;s up ? Can&#039;t one single report bann someone , this report I had submitted was proper , I had a reason ,I had the prufe just go and look at his score hell watch the replay and bystanders just go ask the enemy team and y team and ask them if this person was trolling  ( I just re read the discussion and I didn&#039;t tell u what champion he was playing well he was playing nonther then {{champion:9}} support) what some good last game this turned out to be","replies":[{"poster":"Project Xayah","date":"2016-10-19T00:27:33.394+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"To be picked up for negative behaviour in any given game, only one report is needed. That means that, as an individual, you still have the ability to help Riot detect troublesome players. It's important to keep in mind that false reports will negatively impact this ability by decreasing the validity of future reports, so it's always important to avoid reporting others out of spite (and if you're ever unsure if something is report worthy, you can simply explain so with the \"additional information\" feature below the list of report options). Multiple reports against the same person in any given match will simply add more validity to the reports ( 9 individuals reporting someone suggests a much more valid report than 1 person).\n\nIn order for a person to be banned for negative behaviour, it requires several games of consistent negative behaviour. The reason for this is that Riot understands that players occasionally go on tilt and/or have a bad game. They don't want to punish players for a single instance of \"losing their cool\" and want to do everything they can to avoid false punishments. If a player you reported continues their behaviour, they (should) end up being punished in some form (depending on the severity and consistency of their offences).\n\nAs for the instant feedback system, you will only be notified if a player you reported gets punished *if* you were the most recent report before that player got punished (Riot is looking to change this at some point, if I'm not mistaken). So if the player you reported went on to play another game, got reported in that and then got punished it would be the person in that game who would be notified, not you.\n\nHope this helps clarify things.","replies":[{"poster":"ApolloBrahz","date":"2016-10-19T06:41:36.751+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thanks","replies":[]}]}]}
