Cuz there in the same team ) and he quoted&#039; there sopport is a sopport &#039; then after that I stoped talking 3. And also I think it&#039;s from a few other games I had befor idk how the report system works but maybe cuz of a few other games , and just to state we had a {{champion:92}} mid and like that person afk&#039;ed , ok after all this the message told me that it was exiting the application, it existed then I reopen it and tryed to log in and then it was like your account has been suspended u till 11 of November. And like I&#039;m just not sure why I got banned sure I was a bit toicx but I haven seen any on get banned from that like what the hell I get banned for saying a few things towards my adc . There&#039;s people out there that swear the room up and I get banned ! . ,!
