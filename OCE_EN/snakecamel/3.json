But just like in mid lane when Ekko was about to use his stun the enemy knew so they would all back away to safety or go all-in. So most Summoners that actually play Ekko now, are in jg so you can't see his stun very well until its to late.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Alamo","date":"2015-08-18T22:57:30.528+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"no pls, not gnar support","replies":[]}]}
