In my experience there is rarely an issue with someone not wanting to play support, most people I get matched with are capable of accepting it or even want it (and I'd say there are more who actually want it). When I play TB support is the first or second position to be filled, usually it's ADC/Top/Jungle that I end up having to wait on, I even wait on mid more than on support.","replies":[]}]}]}]}
