I tried restarting my computer and it's the same issue, what do I do?","replies":[{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2019-08-21T11:36:36.877+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Submit a ticket to player support: https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/requests/new\n\nOr:\n\nLog into the banned account on the website and change the password. The client will need you to re-login after the password change, so you can then switch accounts.","replies":[{"poster":"xoRiven","date":"2019-08-21T11:39:55.256+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thanks for the quick reply, I changed the password on the website and that rectified the issue. I do feel as if you should just be auto logged out of the client though if you a make a mistake like this as it does seem like a bit of a hassle changing your password / contacting support.","replies":[{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2019-08-21T11:47:29.276+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It's because the new login flow (with the option to stay logged in) is being rolled out slowly to ensure everything is running as intended (i.e not everyone has it). The client itself isn't updated to reflect the new login flow (again because it's being done in stages) so it's lacking the option to sign out (because the old/current client doesn't need it). \n\nThe result is anyone who leaves on (or turns on? I don't have the new login so I'm not sure) the \"stay logged in\" option who has multiple accounts or is in a situation like yours is running into a bit of drama.","replies":[{"poster":"xoRiven","date":"2019-08-21T11:50:22.577+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I see, thanks for the clarification. \n\nI didn't even intend on having the new client myself, I'm not really sure how I ended up with it honestly, I usually don't turn my PC off but one day I had to restart it due to an update and when I logged back in and opened league I ended up with the new client, without downloading anything prior.","replies":[{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2019-08-21T11:54:49.485+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It's a random roll-out not an opt-in system :) It will eventually go out to everyone, but it's a substantial change so they don't want to dump it all at once in case things go wrong.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]}
