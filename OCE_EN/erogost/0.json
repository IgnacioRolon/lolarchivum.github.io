The matches are over within the first 5-10 minutes since teams snowball so fast now, I&#039;m aware that the meta changes and that&#039;s part of what makes the game what it is and why it&#039;s good. \r\nBut i know i&#039;m not alone here in thinking that the game has gone off the rails a bit. What my friends and I used to love and resort too as our &quot;go to social game&quot;, We now despise and want to avoid like the plague. What we used to enjoy on a daily basis has turned into a once a week nightmare. \r\n \r\nAnd please, I am well aware that a single person crying out on the forums wont do anything, but as I said, I feel this needs to be said. So with that being said i&#039;d love feed back, suggestions, even tips or thoughts on this matter, do people agree that the game is just too fast and feels a bit stale now? Or are we the only ones who don&#039;t like the changes","replies":[{"poster":"Noracto","date":"2016-02-20T13:31:14.039+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"League is A piece of crap now\n\nI have been playing since season 3 aswell\n\nIn season five it was fun and you had a chance even if you were 10 kills behind NOW the enemy gets 2 kils up and it's gg cause the Snowball champs have been buffed to out of controll with all these new items and masteries and the tanks ... the freaking TANKS! out damage the adc's...\n\n\nTHEY ARE SUPPOSED TO BE TANK! TAKE DAMAGE NOT DEAL IT\n\nRiot you have ruined the game in season 6 it freaking sucks now","replies":[]},{"poster":"Bambooze","date":"2015-12-03T23:24:03.682+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Tbh, I have had pretty long games the past few i've played, especially in ranked. The last 3 I think, were around 40 mins each average. You just gotta play right and not make silly mistakes in laning phase, since it is a snowball meta.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Corsage","date":"2015-11-29T08:56:51.400+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yes, you are correct that game do tend to snowball faster and game generally ended faster, but the game is taking a different perspective now, it used to pick late game and scale champion where a lot of high scale champion used to be played ,  which was when champion take a bit to ramp up etc. \nBut changes are needed, not everyone prefer to sit in front of League games where both team just stall for ridiculously long amount of times, I have played in Bronze/Silver elo where games tend to last for 40~50 minutes because both team don't know what to do, and it's very frustrating. Game being at faster pace is not always fun but it's more enjoyable then two mage waveclearing and both team don't know what the hell they are doing. I don't prefer neither but do want most game to be closed out a bit sooner.\nJust like Kha'Zix said \" Change...is good\"","replies":[]}]}
