But recently I&#039;ve been watching a large quantity of videos on League of Legends, and I&#039;ve being feeling tempted to return to the game. However, I feel like League of Legends will have the same effect it had on me previously. The first major effect that League had on me was my toxicity/anger issues would begin to grow and cause troubles in my everyday life. The second effect was the amount of time I sunk into the game, I&#039;d often hold off school work and essays just to &#039;improve&#039; at this game, thinking I would become a high elo player (I wish). The last effect the game had on me was the lack of maintaining relationships between others, over a game... \r\n\r\nI&#039;ve been told I should come back as the game has improved since I lasted played, and I be told the opposite as well. In the time I&#039;ve taken a break I&#039;ve been trying other competitive games so fulfil my crave for a rank system. Its been great so far and I&#039;ve managed to reach Diamond. \r\n\r\nThe 6 month break has a had a huge impact on my life. In the first month I really struggled to not play League but I managed to not press play log in button. I&#039;ve noticed changes to my everyday attitude, I&#039;ve been feeling more positive on a daily basis, and seem have lost my problem of getting angry easily. I&#039;ve found that I&#039;ve made a lot more new friends and have rebuilt some of the relationships which I lost due to the game. \r\n\r\nI&#039;m interested to hear all of your thoughts on the game currently, and whether its worth returning to consider where I am now. \r\n\r\nHave a wonderful day.\r\n{{sticker:slayer-pantheon-thumbs}}","replies":[{"poster":"JasonWazza","date":"2018-01-26T06:34:34.141+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"***","replies":[{"poster":"Klavinmour","date":"2018-01-26T12:01:46.713+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Well jungle is better and doesn't require a specific path to make even dedicated jungle champions viable.\n\nZoe can fuck off though.","replies":[{"poster":"JasonWazza","date":"2018-01-26T14:46:10.884+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"Lmao, apparently i'm not allowed to hate on Zoe.","replies":[{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2018-01-27T00:42:01.186+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":2,"body":"I looked at the comment, Zoe was very much irrelevant to the deletion.

I'm not saying for them not to moderate, they have to moderate consistently. If you want to remove personal attacks, don't only remove some that you don't like, remove all of them.  Seriously this is moderating 101.\n\nNot even close to a logical fallacy, Your asking them not to moderate YOU. They delete comments on a daily basis but the only ones you ever complain about are yours. They spend half there damn time addressing your \"arguments\" \n\n> Except i wasn't being racist, even the volunteers told you guys that.

But hey, why should i expect that people would think logically about what is and isn't racism.\n\nNo the volunteers said you were allowed to report what you wanted. There is nothing in the rules that says you have to speak English, You reporting people cause they use other languages is racist. Sweet so your gonna report Australians because they aren't speaking English. Your literally that guy on public transport complaining about people not speaking English. \n\n> \"you disagreeing with Riot isn't being constructive\" The fuck is this argument? I don't even think i need an argument against this.\n\nYes you do. You never suggest anything they could do, other than \"Hurr durr Tribunal.\" or literally the opposite of whatever balance change they just made. How is that constructive. \n\n> Yes because the arguments are just generally bad, example being your own post. Because hey let's bring it back again to just really have this point hammered home. \"you disagreeing with Riot isn't being constructive\" Fuck i love that point, it's an amazing showing of the general argument.\n\nSweet man, you really made your point here. Definitely added something to the conversation. As I have told you a million times. I don;t agree with everything riot does. Most people on the boards don't. But when YOU spend your entire time disagreeing with literally every decision they make. People end up taking there side. Not cause they agree with them, but cause you treat them like a fucking super villain. \n\n> The reasons we aren't getting tribunal back may have been explained, but they weren't ever good reasons.\n\nHow is \"The bans were always extreme and every single one needed Riot review\" an unacceptable reason.\n\n> OOOOOOOO YEAH, 40 people determines the entire community's opinion.

You don't have one? How shocking, I honestly can't believe you would make such wide ranging statements without any proof to back them up.

Like i said you only complain when your moderated. Even the mods mentioned while they should have caught his first comment, your response was unacceptable. \n\n> Because that issue falls to pieces when you realise that not a single person reviews the bot bans, and yet that's alright, but the tribunal can't be used to work out what is/isn't ok as DETERMINED BY THE COMMUNITY.\n\nAs far as my understanding bans still get reviewed. Its just the hate speech ones that go straight to two weeks. that's right it can't, from what Riot and the volunteers have said it was essentially a witch hunt. The tribunal would always hand down over the top punishments. Which Riot would then have to manually review and change. How does that help? Ok I get it you don't like the bot, but the tribunal was worse.\n\n> Because the burden of proof is meant to be on me for these shitty generalised arguments of \"the community want's X\" Me saying, how do you know the community agrees with you, and then saying \"where's your proof they don't\" isn't an acceptable argument.\n\nExpect your entire argument has been the community is against these bans. If you were urging caution or just voicing concern I wouldn't ask for proof. In fact I never even indetend it in this thread. You both this on yourself dude.\n\n> And not only that, I'm fairly sure the community as a whole, wouldn't be up for people being escalated like they are for 1 word offenses, that a decent amount of the time are said as a quote.\n\nThat's your statement, back it up. Seras has a survey which i agree has a small sample size but it shows most people are for or ambivalent towards the bans. Burden of proof is on you sunishine, and you have none.\n\n> Find me a single place where i told them not to moderate me (the funny thing is, if you look you'll find a post where i asked them to ban me off boards).\n\nLike the last three places where you complained your posts where deleted.
