I&#039;ve seen a lot of changes over the years, some good, some bad. But this truly takes the cake as the worst change I have ever seen. The entire point of ranked league of legends was that you had to be a good, flexible player. Able to play any role required well ENOUGH that you would be able to climb the ranks.\r\n\r\nWith this new system that is now dead, it is going to become league of one trick ponies where more people will be less skilled at the game because they are not forced to actually try. What a horrible, casual environment in what is supposed to be a competitive game.\r\n\r\nAdd to this that you can now queue with as many people as you like. Solo queue was already flawed by allowing duo queues because it skewed the true skill level of everyone in that game. But it was not QUITE impactful enough to matter. Now the game truly has no way to measure individual skill and ranked is now just a mode to mess around in as friends. Like Ranked 5v5 was for everyone but the highest end of players except less restrictive.\r\n\r\nLeague of Legends competitive side has ALWAYS been about solo queue, despite the huge showcasing of its competitive teams. Because it must be understood that the team side of competitive League is one watched and not played. For over 99% of competitive players in this game the experience has and always would be Solo Queue, which is a completely different game to high level competitive 5v5 play. This game is officially dead for all of those players, blind may still be fun for some but anyone who enjoyed playing this game competitively has been pushed to the side. I can see no way how these people can possibly enjoy this game any more.\r\n\r\nYou have literally slapped aside everyone who ever took this game seriously to cater to the people who preferred to play casual mode. Because ranked is has essentially taken the place of the casual mode. There is no real reason to play casual any more when you can play with all your friends in a system that will rank you AND get the roles YOU want to play. I am being completely serious when I say you may as well just delete the casual mode altogether.\r\n\r\nGood job Riot, you&#039;ve really outdone yourself. On the bright side my HDD is 20GB lighter. I won&#039;t be back unless this gets split into another game mode because there&#039;s nothing here for me now.","replies":[{"poster":"BadLuckFollowsMe","date":"2016-01-20T09:40:14.535+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"You lost me when you implied Ranked is the queue you should be in to improve your skills in a role.\nRanked is where you bring your A game, and show your skill in your particular niche. Normals is where you learn champions and improve your mechanics. You don't play Ranked to practice and improve, you play it to win and advance. You should know your stuff BEFORE you get there, not learn on the go.\n\nAs has already been mentioned, even pros and top tier players have their roles and champions where they're good, and when forced out of their comfort zone they range from struggling to utterly abysmal.\n\nThis new system simply stops your fellow idiots from forcing you into a position you don't excel at, then complaining when you fail at it. That's an improvement in every way.","replies":[{"poster":"Ghosthree3","date":"2016-01-20T16:09:50.243+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=BadLuckFollowsMe,realm=OCE,application-id=Ntey9fRZ,discussion-id=7RncTIpf,comment-id=0004,timestamp=2016-01-20T09:40:14.535+0000)\n>\n> You lost me when you implied Ranked is the queue you should be in to improve your skills in a role.\nI never said that. In fact I implied that Ranked is the queue you should be in to improve your skills as a player over all.\n\nI'm sorry you still think Normals are where you learn how to play.

FYI I had 3 accounts in Diamond of my own skill and had leveled an account to 30 for this year. By the way, most top tier players do play more than one role, there are a handful that don't play more than one that well, but they are few and far between and it merely seems that way to you because of streamers. Most of these players can still play other roles to a not awful degree however.\n\nThe fact that people troll with last pick has nothing to do with the system and everything to do with people being people. You honestly think this kind of shit won't still happen, albeit on a lower scale? It was annoying when it happened but it didn't happen enough to be a true issue as far as climbing went.\n\n> [{quoted}](name=UnicornOnAcid,realm=EUW,application-id=Ntey9fRZ,discussion-id=7RncTIpf,comment-id=0003,timestamp=2016-01-20T09:40:07.349+0000)\n>\n> You know they already plan to add a solo que in a couple of weeks strictly for solo no duo/dynamic.\n> \n> http://boards.euw.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/announcements-en/GlxsVpAm-the-2016-ranked-season-updates-on-dynamic-ranked-and-your-feedback\n\nIf solo draft returns as was then I was misinformed and everything I said can be dropped. I simply read the news from within the client which never implied the return of a solo queue.\n\nHowever this is OCE so I wouldn't be surprised if we only get one of the queues regardless because of our population. Similar to why we never got draft.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"UnicornOnAcid","date":"2016-01-20T09:40:07.349+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"You know they already plan to add a solo que in a couple of weeks strictly for solo no duo/dynamic.\n\nhttp://boards.euw.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/announcements-en/GlxsVpAm-the-2016-ranked-season-updates-on-dynamic-ranked-and-your-feedback","replies":[]},{"poster":"Klavinmour","date":"2016-01-20T08:38:00.799+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Well you wont be missed.\n\nIf you can't see why the new queue system had to be implemented, then you're likely part of the reason it needed to exist.\n\nReally, SoloQ is about being able to play all roles? Then why is it if you watch a high tier player that they fail in any aspect that isn't their main role?\nSeriously go watch a Diamond ADC main play Mid or Top. Go watch a LCS Top Laner play Jungle or ADC.\nThey wont represent this ideal that you're bitching wont exist anymore.\n\nThis new system stops people from AFKing in champ select.\nIt stops trolls from forcing a double mid or top lane because they are last pick and refuse to respect the pick order.\nit stops trolls from not banning a champion in order to force that champion to be played.\n\nRiot has NEVER catered to the casual players, this is evidenced by the game balanced being centered on Diamond to Challenger.\nConsidering you've been in Plat and Diamond the past three seasons you SHOULD understand everything I've said here.\nBut I wouldn't be surprised if you're just an arrogant arse that paid for ELO and boasts like you think you know what you're talking about.","replies":[]},{"poster":"GunflameSmurf","date":"2016-01-20T07:09:40.061+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'm very happy with the changes and I play ranked almost exclusively since season (I started playing LOL before Mordekaiser was released).\n\nIf you don't like the changes just find another game.  6 years is more than enough to enjoy a game.","replies":[]},{"poster":"the4nr","date":"2016-01-20T06:16:53.659+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"i understand how you feel about the situation since i only just got into ranked and almost all the ones ive played have been people who duo que, its not a problem per say but it can be when there is a literal divide between players who know each other and players who dont. they suddenly stop talking to the team or they both start to flame someone because they cant point fingers at each other.","replies":[]}]}
