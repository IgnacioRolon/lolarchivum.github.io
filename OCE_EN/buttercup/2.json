You took a skin line I didn't think would work too well and made something great out of it!\nEdit: In terms of feedback, I'd say that you could probably make some of the mechanics references more subtle, mainly when fighting Akali. For example, writing \"And blocked her knife swipe with his shield\" instead of mentioning autos. It's up to you, though, if you feel your way works better, then it probably does.\n","replies":[]},{"poster":"hook line sinka","date":"2017-03-13T07:10:17.750+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"\"By the by,\nLet me know when the chefs are employed.\"\nI don't know if its just me, but that part seems a little off in terms of how i say it over in my head. just my opinion.","replies":[]}]}
