From outside?,\r\nCan you take off your mask?&rdquo;\r\n\r\n&ldquo;Yes and no&rdquo;, I reply,\r\nFeeling slightly annoyed,\r\n&ldquo;I was born of this Earth,\r\nBut was forged in the Void.&rdquo;\r\n\r\nI found myself trapped there,\r\nA century ago,\r\nWhen I fell through a chasm,\r\nThat was hidden by snow.\r\n\r\nI lamented my fate,\r\nA death so contrived,\r\nBut before it could hit me,\r\nThe ground opened wide.\r\n\r\nPurple darkness consumed me,\r\nAround my mouth, smoking,\r\nAnd like Bjergsen at Worlds,\r\nI found myself choking.\r\n\r\nWhen the Void let me go,\r\nI was surrounded by monsters.\r\nInsects, and genies,\r\nEyeballs, and lobsters.\r\n\r\nI fought them all off,\r\nWith the last of my strength.\r\nLost both of my legs,\r\nBut kept them at arm&rsquo;s length.\r\n\r\nI was still stuck in the Void,\r\nRecalling a story from Mom:\r\n&ldquo;When you are in trouble,\r\nStar Guardians will come.&rdquo;\r\n\r\nI prayed for decade,\r\nAnother, and more,\r\nRepairing my body,\r\n&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll escape here&rdquo;, I swore.\r\n&emsp;\r\nWhere were the Guardians?\r\nHad I been abandoned?\r\nMy body was fixed,\r\nBut I still remained stranded.\r\n\r\nI wandered the Void,\r\nAimlessly, like a wight,\r\nWhen one of my walks,\r\nFrom the ceiling, shone a light!\r\n\r\nA voice called towards me,\r\nShe called herself Ahri.\r\nA Star Guardian at last!\r\nElegant, and starry.\r\n\r\nI called back to her,\r\nAnd pleaded for help.\r\nShe said she could not,\r\nAnd I was like &ldquo;Welp.&rdquo;\r\n\r\nShe told me the void,\r\nWould remove all her powers.\r\nI realised at that point,\r\nStar Guardians were cowards.\r\n\r\nAhri, repulsed, said,\r\n&ldquo;It&rsquo;s more than just sparkling!\r\nIf you think it&rsquo;s so easy,\r\nYou try being a Guardian!&rdquo;\r\n\r\n&ldquo;Maybe I will!&rdquo;\r\nI yelled in distress,\r\n&ldquo;Could you guide me through\r\nThe application process?&rdquo;\r\n\r\nShe showed me a star,\r\nA tiny gold jewel,\r\nAnd threw right at me,\r\nShouting &ldquo;Try it, old fool!&rdquo;\r\n\r\nIts power moved through me,\r\nThe stars pierced my mind,\r\nMy metal legs shook,\r\nI saw a light and went blind.\r\n&emsp;\r\nWhen my vision returned,\r\nI examined my body,\r\nWhite clothes, and blue ribbons,\r\nI was dressed just like Poppy!\r\n\r\nI aimed my mechanical\r\nArm at the sky,\r\nAnd knew that the star,\r\nGave me the power to fly.\r\n\r\nI fired a chain,\r\nStraight through the ceiling,\r\nAnd pulled myself up,\r\nMy heart rapidly beating.\r\n\r\nI&rsquo;d finally escaped,\r\nMy trial was done,\r\nEach one of my six legs,\r\nWas now also a gun!\r\n\r\nSo now I&rsquo;m here writing,\r\nThis poem in a Word doc,\r\nSaying &ldquo;Look out, world!\r\nHere comes Star Guardian Urgot!&rdquo;\r\n\r\n_Fin_","replies":[{"poster":"Wim Tinton","date":"2018-03-09T00:33:44.156+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I enjoyed this!\n\nBe careful of your comma usage. Your third stanza for example:\n\n\"I found myself trapped there,\nA century ago,\"\n\nyour first comma is unneeded. Without it, it would look this this.\n\n\"I found myself trapped there\nA century ago,\"\n\n\nThis would be called enjambment, where one line runs over to the next. When this happens, the last word on the end of the line is automatically given extra attention by the reader. So, instead of having the reader focused on the word \"there\" you could have them focus on the word trapped. ie:\n\n\"I found myself trapped\nA century ago,\"\n\nNow whether or not this works for this line is up to you. It's just something to keep in mind.\n\nAlso, if lines are end stopped, ie. they start and end in one line like \"I was surrounded by monsters.\" It gives them more emphasis.\n\nBest,\n\n~Wim","replies":[{"poster":"Buttercup","date":"2018-03-09T01:14:56.619+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Wow, that is legit feedback, I'd never even heard of enjambment before, and your comments about attention to ending words is something I haven't considered before!\n\nThanks a ton, I'll incorporate this in my future works!","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Fluff ewe","date":"2018-03-08T10:32:26.673+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"So much cheek. Very clever. I really liked this! though I'm not a poet at all, so I can't give very remarkable feedback.\n\nOne thing I can offer: dialogue grammar, please <3 \n\nThings like\n> \"Yes and no\", I reply,\n\nshould be\n> \"Yes and no,\" I reply, \n\nLikewise,\n>like \"Welp.\"\n\ncan be one of the two, depending on what your sentence wants to be\n>like, \"Welp.\" \nlike \"welp.\"\n\nThat said, people will rarely realise these even are mistakes, much less have objections towards them (especially considering your reader base), but they might be handy for any writing in the future! Dialogue tags & their punctuation are very commonly wrong and can instantly put off more picky readers because they work as very reliable red flags. Reading up on them will always be helpful. \n\nGlad to hear you had fun writing it, though. Good luck!
