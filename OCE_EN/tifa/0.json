I usually run it at 144 fps, however since the latest patch, it's been dropping to 80, 90 and is all over the place. I've tried running on lowest settings and I've had the same issue.\n\n\"but it's over 60fps, should be fine\" - It's not, dropping 60 frames in a second is very noticeable and makes the gameplay chunky.\n\nI reinstalled League onto my SSD (was on HDD), reverted my Graphics Card Drivers to older ones and it's still happening. I have no issue with other games which makes me believe the latest patch has been causing this.\n\nAny ideas?\n\nEDIT: Just tested ARAM Map, no issues.","replies":[]}
