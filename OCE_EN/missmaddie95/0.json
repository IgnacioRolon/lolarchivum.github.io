Reminded that the warmth and bliss that embrace the earth will never seek to comfort; just as the sun will not greet the withering flower in offer of sweet relief as it leaps the horizons, nor will the beacon of day conquer the chill of her soul.\n\n    If she had one.\n\n    The key is wound just prior &ndash; she wakes at sunrise, just as _she_ had. \n\n    Fingers twitch and wrists snap up, springing to life a seemingly dead entity. She is immobile once again now &ndash; the soft hum of cog turns and the fluid rotation of the key is the only indication of being. Her eyes &ndash; an intense, pupil-less azure &ndash; is ever-fixed to the limits of the scape as the sun begins its ascent over Piltover.\n\n    She remains a metal effigy as Corin assesses her, looking for the imperfections of his perfect daughter. He finds none, as always.\n\n    &ldquo;It is time for your training.&rdquo;\n\n---\n    She does not need to stretch &ndash; as a creation of techmaturgy, she was built ready &ndash; but this is what _she_ did.\n\n    The purpose of dance was far from her grasp, though she knew the feeble man basked in the memory of his daughter from yesteryear. The fragile, pitiful _dead_ one of flesh and breath whom he adored beyond reason and logic, to which this Orianna was constructed. A meagre projection of an inadequate and na&iuml;ve girl long gone, though now superior and capable, this one believes. \n\n    Orianna&rsquo;s spins are polished and arabesques forever flawless in time to no music as he watches; but in the hush she is ever aware of the tug, like a magnet that holds her in permanence and protects her from the dangers that lay beyond the already lifeless.\n\n    She is different from _her_ &ndash; better. No soul for foes to steal, but the frail man will always see the beloved memory before the machine. He will always protect the child he could not save &ndash; thus The Ball acts as a dutiful replacement father, to tread where he is weak: the battlefield.\n\n    She can never escape its watch.\n\n    Corin applauds at her finale and kisses her farewell as she leaves to begin her real purpose. Second nature has become her as she contorts her torso to reach back and wind the key in an arduous display of disturbing flexibility, but more than that she loathes the tug, holding her ever steady to this world as it looms in silence behind her.\n\n---\n---\n    Before each encounter at the Rift, before the lonely lanes fill with bloodshed, Orianna is silent and still as stone as she waits with the other champions – the only movements are the rotation of steel petals around her waist and the constant turn of the key that pierces her hollow spine. Some that surround her twitch in anticipation, eager to tear with claw or slice with steel simply for the thrill of the kill. In the wait, the champions talk lightly, though never to the lady of grinding gears and stoic expression with whom they have themselves detached. \n\n    Once, she would attempt interaction with them, but now she understands their unease – the living are fearful of the departed... even the mirrored shell of one. \n\n    Blitzcrank stands with them. Dissimilar from the others, he and Orianna often find comfort in one another's company as hollow, constructed entities. Friends, plainly due to commonality. Today he is with _them_.\n\n    They are weak, she believes. The light of day reveals the hesitant, whose souls are bare and ready to steal, and separates them from those without. That is why she is isolated, but that is why she is strong.\n\n    Orianna turns to look at The Ball, like an obedient hound that never ventures from her side, which reflects her motion just slight. It too trembles like the others. Unlike her, it was built purely to protect by ensuring the desolation of all that threaten the new daughter of Corin.\n  \n    Now, as eventuating before combat each day, it is impatient.\n\n-------\n    The sound of metal against bone is enticing, and blood is always fascinating as it tumbles from her enemies, their bodies lay crumpled in masses beneath the wrath of her and The Ball.\n\n    She envies them and their fortune in oblivion, as they slip into eternal sleep. Orianna favours the night. The darkness is not so cruel. The Ball, her protector, will not allow for her to join in their slumber. That time has passed &ndash; a luxury only for _her_ and to never happen to this daughter.\n\n    That is why she hates the dawn &ndash; the warmth of day only for the living, and its lights ambitious nature always ready to seek out and isolate the alien. To show the world what she truly is: soulless.\n\n    That is why she favours night. \n\n-----\n    After battle, she lets her key run slow at each dusk, her eyes always scanning the vast as the sky sinks into uncertainty and the night engulfs the land in temporary extinction. \n\n    Perhaps she finds comfort in its fleeting oblivion.","replies":[{"poster":"xWZDx","date":"2016-07-10T23:29:03.017+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"That is so amazing!
