And the new passive is just terrible i cant keep bloodwell up long enough for is to work and die my question is why is Aatrox not team based.","replies":[{"poster":"Essembie","date":"2017-03-09T09:26:39.162+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"Suspect the change in kit will take some getting used to. Been around long enough to know that the day after major changes to a champ the purists come out and whine about it (I did the same vocally with xerath and taliyah and less vocally with ali - turns out I just needed to practice the new kit a bit more).\n\nI reckon give it a run for a week to get used to it, perhaps even in norms, then come back with a breakdown of why it sucks / is bearable / is good.\n\nI have faith enough in rito to know they've got some bright minds working on this stuff and they wouldnt cripple a champ just to piss people off.","replies":[]},{"poster":"NIghtshadowb","date":"2017-03-09T02:53:31.998+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"Aatrox is completely turned into trash.

What you did to aa over the last year or 2 is fuckin sad.. at least i know i dont play him now","replies":[{"poster":"Alakazamo","date":"2017-03-09T06:34:19.338+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"and to think that this rework was to address his \"health issues\"","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Talon12","date":"2017-03-09T01:02:57.052+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Build him as more of a tank than an assassin.
