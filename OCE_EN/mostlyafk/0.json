Currently there are some helpful searches especially for ADC mains such as \"marksmen\" and other role specifics that filter champion select for you, however I feel for certain roles, Top and Jungle in particular where they feel left out in this regard.\r\nMostly for Top you would need to search for \"\"Fighter\" or \"Tank\"etc to filter however I don't believe this is the best way.\r\n\r\nWould anyone else be excited to see player generated search filters available in profile much like the current item build system?\r\nI for one would enjoy the ease of being able to create a list of the current champions I use for each lane so that I don't have to search through every champion each time to decide between them.","replies":[{"poster":"FuyuMoro","date":"2014-12-24T14:04:00.099+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The problems then becomes the player sticks to whats there rather than trying things tat are different, i personally champions with a strange build in an abnormal role, like when eve is first introduced as jungles in professional play, this kindda things wont happen if that was the case. some players also develop their own play style in game, meaning that regardless of what role they are playing, they will pick a champion and play them uniquely to adapt them to the role, of course some champions are better than others at those roles, but with a good mechanic, you can overcomes some of these problems and still do well.\n\nI do however like the idea of a personalised favorite list, it would help for picks, bans, etc. rather than having to rely on experience.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Olee","date":"2014-12-23T19:29:05.737+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I too would love this.

Even if its just like a checkbox for \"add to list\", nothing complicated like being able to make custom lists and certain champs on them etc...","replies":[]}]}
