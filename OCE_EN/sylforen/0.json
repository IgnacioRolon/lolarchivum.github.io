{"poster":"Sylforen","date":"2015-05-17T04:04:05.126+0000","title":"Zed Changes","subforum":"Gameplay & Strategy","up_votes":2,"down_votes":3,"body":"I read about why you recently changed Zed, to open more opportunities for counter play from his ultimate. I understand the intent but the execution is not right. Zed feels clunky now. Riot claims that Zed can kill a target until a turret in less than a second and get out without repercussions. This is only true come mid and late game, the only time this will happen early game/lane phase is if the individual doesn&#039;t back and has low hp. That&#039;s not Zed being OP, that&#039;s an individual being stupid.\n\nThere is two items already that heavily counter Zed, QSS (and Mercurial, but they active is the same so same item in my head) and Zhonyas. Not to mention certain champion abilities that negates/revives Zed&#039;s damage (Kayle, Zilean, Aatrox), but others champion&#039;s abilities that give a lot of movement which somewhat counter Zeds that don&#039;t think (Ezreal, Corki, Caitlyn to an extent, Katarina). Yes Zed does a lot of damage, but for Zed to poke in lane phase often it costs him so much energy and the cool down on his W is in such a good spot that you will be punished if you use stupidly (get ganked if over extended).\n\nIn summary, I&#039;m just saying that Riot seems to be appealing to the Bronze demographic. Appealing to people who, I don&#039;t want to call them dumb. But are too dumb to buy a certain item, both AD and AP users have an option (QSS, and Zhonyas). My questions are; Why hit Zed with this, he is in a good place at the moment (feels clunky now, and maybe a bug with his ultimate. I can&#039;t seem to use, have to press 4-5 times). Why no nerfs to Katarina, Le Blanc, Diana, or any other mid lane power house?\n\nZed isn&#039;t dead, yet. He is still decent, but that change just destroyed his chance against certain champions. (Ahri, Orianna). Zed is a champion about outplaying your opponent and he has the kit to do so, but this change is just stupid.\n\nPlease be considerate of other people if commenting here, don&#039;t just say \"you&#039;re wrong\". Just evidence to back up your point of view, I think it is because of x and due to y.\n\nEDIT1: Would just like to say, a massive thank you to the first few people commenting. Not just saying \"Fuck you, you're wrong\" or \"err maahhh gerdd zerddd errrrrppppp\".

Before the nerf, you could ult and Ahri and shadow swap to dodge charm (Most Ahri's throw charm behind them when Zed ults, which is smart). It just seems stupid to lock out for one second, Zed is only as good as the person playing him. That applies to every champion, but Zed relies on his shadows to out play his opponent, you cannot use shadows defensively now as well. \n\nI'm not saying he's gimped and never playing him again, he just feels clunky.","replies":[{"poster":"JasonWazza","date":"2015-05-18T09:55:51.278+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":">Before the nerf, you could ult and Ahri and shadow swap to dodge charm\n\nSo in other words, you weren't getting punished for not waiting for a cooldown, which you should be.\n\nI'm sorry but if your actually bitching because your ulting people while they have a major cooldown up (the example being Ahri charm) then that's your fault for fucking up.\n\nThere is no reason their shouldn't be a lockout on the ult.","replies":[{"poster":"Sylforen","date":"2015-05-18T15:28:34.847+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"After a few more games I actually see this as a buff, people seem to be thinking \"Oh Zed can't go back to his shadow now so I will follow him forever\" Nek minnit. Lockout timer just means stupid people are just going to get juked, no lockout timer means that stupid people are going to get juked. So I see no point in the change. Zed's ultimate is not what makes him strong, it's his ability to dive your front line and assassinate your squishy. But, three items exist which heavily counter this (QSS, Zhonyas, and GA). \n\nBut your reply will be something like \"In other words you are forcing someone to build an item that they don't want to have, I'm sorry but you are bitching that there is a lockout because some people are too dumb to buy an item\" But on that same token, there are whole champions which counter Zed.\n\nYou see an enemy first pick, insta-lock a Zed. You pick Kayle. Suddenly Zed can't harass you (Kayle heal/better poke with Q + E), Zed can't kill you (R). Or pick up a Lissandra, Zilean, Annie, Diana, Leona, Taric, Wukong, Jax, Irelia, Malz, Vlad, Nasus, Syndra for your team. But people don't try and counter, they just go OH THEY HAVE A ZED OKIIES IMMA PLAY LUX.\n\nBefore people ask why does x champion from that list counter Zed. Annie, Leona, Taric, Malz, Lissandra all have point and click stun/lock down abilities. Kayle and Zilean and either stop damage from being dealt from Zed, or revive someone back to life. Jax and Wukong have very easy stun/knock up abilities which is godly for peeling. While Zed's pop can still kill Vlad while pooled, he can dodge A LOT of Zed's abilities while pooled, and his ultimate increases all damage, meaning Zed dies faster. Diana has a shield, longer range poke that goes through minions, and a pull back, not to mention her ultimate. Finally, Syndra can stun lock Zed very easily forcing him to either blow a shadow or a flash, even if Zed all ins Syndra, she can just ult and she does a magic trick.\n\nThat's just some of the champions which go well against Zed. I could continue the list for days. \n\nI'm not complaining that I ult someone when they have a major cooldown (Ahri Charm). I'm complaining because before hand a lot of skill shots were well SKILL shots against Zed. Keep your calm and land your stun on Zed, suddenly he has lost a 1:30cd and is in balls deep. Combine that under a turret, and Zed's dead baby, Zed's dead.\n\nThe BIGGEST reason I am complaining about this change is because of champions like Le Blanc, when you max W on Le Blanc it's only a five second cooldown (Where is outplay/counter player there?) there is no lock out on that as well. Katarina doesn't give a shit how long you hold her head under water, you can shit on her in lane but she will EVENTUALLY get items and destroy your team faster than you can sneeze. Not to mention Katarina's E gives her damage reduction, like seriously on an assassin (I know they have ideas for Katarina, but nothing has been said in a while about them). Again, just two examples of many. But that's the thing, you cannot perfectly balance a game. As a wise man once said \"Balance is weakness\".","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"IVIemes","date":"2015-08-12T04:54:12.033+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I agree with this all the way.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Iosua Bot","date":"2015-08-12T00:57:37.094+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"As a Zed main (30.1 thousand Mastery Points if your gonna bitch about me).
