{"poster":"JinHae","date":"2019-08-28T17:29:38.531+0000","title":"Helmet Bro - The Champion","subforum":"Player Creations","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yes that title is a double entendre \r\n\r\nNow we see helmet bro taking some punishment in many splash arts. It's time for him to fight back. Sort of. \r\nI wanted to make a champion that hasn't been done before, and allow helmet bro to really shine in his own way, even though he's always taking a beating!\r\n\r\nPassive - The helmet: Helmet bro gains 150% of his armour and magic resist as max health. When helmet bro dies, he drops his helmet. Allies can pick his helmet up to reduce his respawn time by 50% and added homeguards on respawn. \r\n\r\nQ - Courage!: Helmet bro's next auto attack becomes empowered dealing 150% of his auto attack damage and stealing 50% of the enemies armour and magic resist (Damage is applied before stealing the defences). Within the next 1.5 seconds you can reactivate this ability to instantly strike again, giving back the stolen stats but dealing another 150% damage (Damage is applied before giving back the stats). If the target is out of range, helmet bro will leap into the air and strike them. If helmet bro doesn't strike back the second time, he will keep the stats for the next 6 seconds.\r\n\r\nW - Rally to me!: Helmet bro becomes a beacon of hope for his team. Himself and allies within range gain 20-40 adaptive force. While this is active helmet bro loses some mana per second.\r\n\r\nE - Pay back!: Helmet bro begins to guard the damage he takes from champions and cannot attack over the next 2 seconds. He then swings his sword and unleashes all the damage he would have took back in a 360 degree radius around him. This works through crowd control. Any enemies hit become silenced for 0.5 seconds.\r\n\r\nR - True form: Helmet bro removes his helmet and becomes a demonic entity that floats and emanates power for 6 seconds. While in this form all his abilities are replaced with \"Reckoning\" and share the same cooldown. If helmet bro dies during this form he does not drop his helmet upon death.\r\n\r\nReckoning: Fires a beam of energy in a straight line. All enemies within the line take 7/12/14% maximum health true damage. Helmet bro heals for 25% of the damage dealt. If reckoning kills a target the duration of \"true form\" is increased by 3 seconds.\r\n\r\nExample build: Iceborn gauntlet, Merc treads, spirit visage, thorn mail, death's dance, GA/Adaptive.\r\n\r\nEven if this gets no attention it was fun to make and theories.","replies":[]}
