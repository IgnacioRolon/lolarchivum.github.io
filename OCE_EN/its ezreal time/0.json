A bit of background information, I was a bronze V player in season 4, because I trolled rank games to no end, although my skill level was somewhere around silver V. When I finally decided to climb during preseason, I made it all the way to gold V after a couple hundred games, during my climb from bronze to silver, i believe I had 30 game win streak somewhere. Then season 5 started. I dropped down to bronze 1 going 4-6 in my placement matches, I shot up to silver 2 in no time. However, this is when i hit a snag. After being frustrated about not being able to achieve my former Gold status, losing promotion series after promotion series, believing that I was still capable of of gold, I went on full tilt. I lost game after game, until finally, I was in silver V with bronze 3 MMR. This is where I would be stuck in for the next _**700**_ games.\n I would blame my team nearly every game,  with a win rate of about 50% at my now former rank and MMR. I believed I was stuck in elo hell. I mean, how could a **_&#039;GOLD&#039;_** player have a 50% win rate in bronze 3.  I kept asking myself, why on earth do I keep getting bad teams, why is x player feeding so much, what did I do to deserve this, I&#039;m sure many of you can relate.\n Then, I hit a revelation. I was complete trash at this game, somehow, over the course of those 700 games, my skill level had decreased from gold to bronze. Something had to change if I was to climb back to where I wanted to belong. I started listening to calm music, and focusing only on my own game play. I would assess after every match, sometimes even after making a mistake, I would ask myself, \"what could I have done better here\" or \"what could I do to help my teammate that is struggling\". Slowly but surely, I started to climb. I even achieved a win rate of 90% in 20 games at one point, and in another couple hundred games, I finally achieved Gold.\n Why am I writing this, there are many threads about elo hell, the one and most common response is that, \"Elo Hell does not exist\" I however, believe that Elo Hell does exist, it is different for every player, but the same. We create it in our minds, because we as humans are naturally proud, and would rather notice the flaws of others than our own. I am not the perfect person nor am I a good LoL player, hell I still get angry at this game. However, through the process of climbing, I have realized that, If I am not where I want to be, it is entirely my own fault, and I must personally improve. I hope this post helps another player in their journey, not only through LoL, but in life as well.\n\nI wish you all good luck.  \n-Its Ezreal Time","replies":[{"poster":"ShuffledPancake","date":"2015-05-10T04:54:04.099+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"Dont do promos - ez win","replies":[]},{"poster":"Arcane Azmadi","date":"2015-05-10T02:15:34.140+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":2,"body":"No, Elo hell COMPLETELY exists (although it should probably be called \"division hell\" now, but that doesn't have the right ring to it).\n\nThe most infuriating thing I hear about this game is \"if you're in bronze it's because you're bad\". This is a clueless and idiotic statement with absolutely NO basis in reality. Let's look at it a bit at a time:\n\n**POINT 1: It IS actually possible to lose a game through no fault of your own.**\nDo you believe that it's completely impossible for a player to lose a game for ANY reason other than their own incompetence? That ANY game they lose HAS to be their fault? Yes? Then you're a cretin.\n\nIf one of my teammates never connects and we lose the inevitable 4v5, if one of them is a hideous troll who spends the entire game intentionally feeding, or if several of them are just _so cluelessly bad_ that they shouldn't even be allowed to queue for ranked, does that make the loss my fault? Of course it fucking doesn't! If I fulfill the requirements of my role as well as should be expected and someone else on the team doesn't, you know what that makes the loss? _Their goddamn fault._\n\nAfter all, I'm 1 man on a team of 5. What makes it MY fault rather than any of my other teammates' faults? Oh, so we split the blame evenly and all accept 20% of the responsibility? But how is that fair when I performed much better than one of my teammates (and I don't just mean better KDA, I mean doing my job and not being stupid)? You can't just say \"you're all equally at fault\" when every player's performance is not equal, that's simply not reasonable. That's like a clueless kindergarten teacher saying that both kids are at fault so there should be no hard feelings when one stupid little brat stole the others' lunch, pulled his hair and pushed him over in the sandbox. That's called the [Golden Mean Fallacy](http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoldenMeanFallacy).\n\nThe first thing we have to accept is that _it IS actually possible to NOT be responsible for the loss of your team._\n\n**POINT 2: \"But, but, you should just be able to carry harder!\"**\nTechnically true. But riddle me this: how goddamn much better do I have to be, huh? Personally I rate my skill as silver/gold level or so (which is not actually that high considering this is OCE we're talking about here), largely because I have better than average game knowledge and awareness. If I'm not good enough to carry a bronze game with feeders, idiots, trolls and afks, how much better do I have to be? Platinum level? Diamond? _Challenger?_ I'm not THAT good and don't pretend to be. So tell me why I need to be _a goddamn Diamond_ to win games in _Bronze!?_ Even being a mere Silver-level SHOULD, by all rights, be enough because if you're a Silver-level player you \"should\" be in SILVER!\n\nAlso, I don't always get to play carries. That's the way the game goes. When I'm support and my ADC sucks, I'm basically dead weight and there's nothing I can do. Had a complete waste-of-time game recently where the Jinx I was futilely trying to support couldn't last hit for nuts and rushed (although I use the term loosely because it took her _twenty minutes_ to complete it) an Essence Reaver as her first item (incidentally that game was followed by a Caitlyn who rushed BotRK and then Triforce and also had the map awareness of a dead sloth). I'm a naturally supporty player, maining supports and tanky initiator junglers (although I also play a very mean Karthus, Corki and Rumble). EVERY player does not have the opportunity to carry EVERY game. Sometimes you're relying on your teammates to carry for you as long as you support them. That's why certain roles and champions are called _\"carries\"._\n\nBasically, it's stupid to say that any player who can't carry their team deserves to lose.\n\n**POINT 3: Your opponents are trying to win as well.**\nThis isn't beginner bots, boys, even if some of the players may play like it. Say you're a silver, or even a gold-level player stuck in a bronze game and doing your best. What if your counterpart on the opposing team is a _plat_ level player who is simply better than you? You get dominated by the better player and your team loses. Does that make you a bronze-level noob just because you came up against a worthy opponent? (HINT: the answer is \"no\".)\n\nSomething a lot of people don't understand (among other things) is that you can only solo carry a bad team if you are considerably better than the ENTIRE enemy team. Just because your bronze team are noobs doesn't mean that the opposing team are too, and if they're not, you're screwed, because overcoming overwhelming odds in LoL is based on _capitalising on your opponents' mistakes._ Someone has to win and someone has to lose every game. They don't magically \"balance out\". Speaking of which...\n\n**POINT 4: \"If you deserve to get out of bronze, you will eventually rise.\"**\nOK, how does that follow? The logic seems to be that, as long as YOU personally are better than a bronze player, karma will magically lift you out of bronze hell (not the champion, the universal concept). But if, as we've already established, it's possible for you to lose a game through no fault of your own, HOW does it then follow that this cannot happen to you REPEATEDLY? \"Oh, based on the law of averages-\" Do you even know what you're talking about? Let me explain it: if you have _bad luck_ and happen to get repeated terrible teams (and I mean REALLY terrible) _you will repeatedly lose._ Why is this concept so hard for people to grasp? If you can lose 1 game through no fault of your own (and you can), then you can theoretically lose SEVERAL games through no fault of your own. There is absolutely NO universal law stating that you cannot get trolls, feeders and afks in back-to-back games. You do not \"earn karma\" for having a bad team that guarantees you will get a good team in the next game. If you toss a coin 20 times in a row, there is NO guarantee that you will get 10 heads and 10 tails; in fact, it's highly unlikely you will.\n\n**POINT 5: How do you get placed in Bronze in the first place?**\nAs the OP himself explained, he ended the preseason in Gold V, but started this season in deep Bronze. The placement system for this season was _garbage,_ basically amounting to \"play 10 games then get randomly dumped somewhere in Bronze regardless of the results or where you started from\". So I think it's fair to say that there are a LOT of people starting in Bronze who never deserved to be there in the first place. Once there, though, you're subject to all the whims of fate outlined above.\n\nOK, so did everyone follow all those points? Good. Now go on with ignoring everything I said and telling me how I'm just a QQing noob who deserves to be in Bronze forever.","replies":[{"poster":"Its Ezreal Time","date":"2015-05-10T03:58:19.082+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"In general, the players you are placed with are of equal skill to you. The only two scenarios that this fact would not be true is, 1. You're smurfing, 2. Your skill is either greater, or inferior to those placed in your matches, resulting in you climbing, or dropping divisions until you reach a division suited to you, where your win rate should be, give or take, around 50%.  As you mentioned, LoL has many factors associated to how 'skillful' a certain player is at this game. Where as one person is better at securing kills during the lane phase. another may have superior map control, through warding and map awareness, a third player may lack skill in both these areas, however wins his matches through clutch decision making, baron/dragon/objective calls.\n\nThe beauty of this game is that, every player has their strengths and weaknesses, however combined as a team, they can chose to capitalize on every individuals strengths and help bolster their weak points, or fall apart by failing to acknowledge what they are good at, and only picking at their weak areas, (most of the time, through flaming, \"omg nunu, y u so noob. u no gank\" Meanwhile, nunu has secured 3 dragons 20 minutes into the game.) Something I've noticed is that, the team with better synergy, not through champions, but through the players themselves, will be more likely to win. \nExample:\nhttp://matchhistory.oce.leagueoflegends.com/en/#match-details/OC1/89272870/200202888?tab=overview\n\nWe pretty much had two options in this game, where we were getting smashed in the early to mid game, 1. encourage each other to play better, and win the game through stalling, and listening to one another whether it be through chat or pings. 2. Flame, and crumble apart. and have a guaranteed loss. We chose option 1. The result? A victory where many players would've /ff'd at 20, hence denying a chance of victory all together. I later discovered (due to flaming in all chat/postgame) that the opposing team, while having a considerable lead on us, took option 2. as soon as things started to turn south for them. This game could have gone both ways, as both teams made errors during the late game. However, the one that stayed positive, won the game. \n\nYes I understand that this doesn't happen every game, and sometimes you lose through AFK's or people that troll. However I assure you, once you get to mid silver, the trolls are basically nonexistent. I have won games 4 vs 5 and lost games 5 vs 4, so the AFK factor, may be crippling, but it doesn't mean you cannot win the game. Sometimes you may lose a game where everyone is positive, due to simply being outplayed. I also know that you cannot control five other players, however generally your calls will be taken into consideration if you're doing well. The last thing I know is that, the most consistent factor in ANY game of LoL,_** is yourself**_. \n\nHow you chose to conduct yourself in game, based on your attitude, and the decisions you make, has a MASSIVE influence on the resulting outcome of the game. Someone flaming? Mute them, and  encourage the rest of your team, especially the one the flame is directed toward. The last pick teemo that threatened to feed if he didn't get top going 0-3 at 15 minutes? Help him out, maybe he has been keeping up in CS, say \"nice job keeping up in cs bro\". It's little things like that, that build trust and encourage teamwork. \n\nI myself try to abide by this in each and every single match, note _**TRY**_. Sometimes I still argue, sometimes I still flame, however in most of my matches I don't. But for me, that's a massive improvement from flaming in nearly every match. After all, we're only human. \n\nAlthough I am only a low gold player, sometimes I duo queue with my friend in low silver, needless to say, even though I play champions that I myself have little to no experience in. We win through decision making and map awareness and haven't lost a single game so far. This, is enough to prove to me that, you don't have to be far greater than your opponents to win, you just need to play smart, have a positive attitude, and be a tad better.","replies":[{"poster":"Arcane Azmadi","date":"2015-05-10T05:28:37.021+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Its Ezreal Time,realm=OCE,application-id=FjGAIbRv,discussion-id=tPOQVyui,comment-id=00010000,timestamp=2015-05-10T03:58:19.082+0000)\n>\n> In general, the players you are placed with are of equal skill to you. \n\nOK, so if your entire argument is based on this single assertion, then it falls flat on its face at the first hurdle. What's your basis for claiming this? You've never been teamed with players so bad they can't find the QWER keys without spraining their fingers? As I pointed out, MOST players got dumped in Bronze at the start of this season (yourself included) so belief in any kind of skill parity among Bronze players is absurd.  Also, your claim that \"Your skill is either greater, or inferior to those placed in your matches, resulting in you climbing, or dropping divisions until you reach a division suited to you, where your win rate should be, give or take, around 50%.\" only makes sense if you're comparing your skill against your _opponents,_ COMPLETELY missing the point that your skill may be superior to _your own teammates._ So what happens when your skill is superior to your opponents, but the rest of your teammates are inferior and you lose anyway and fall divisions? Why, I believe your entire theory falls apart, doesn't it?\n\nFinally, you said that \"The beauty of this game is that, every player has their strengths and weaknesses,\". Come on. You and I and EVERYONE all know that some players ONLY have weaknesses. We've all been there. Yes, it's unpleasant. But it's also TRUE, just like global warming and the fundamental unfairness of life.","replies":[{"poster":"McRuthless","date":"2015-05-10T17:35:45.755+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"And what happens when your team mates skills are superior to the enemy team?

You only need a 50-55% win rate to climb, and a player only slightly better than the people he's playing with gets that by tipping the scales in the close games, not the games where one team is vastly superior to the other.
