Instead I get into the loading screen everyone is loading up normal except me and akali. I was waiting for about 2 minutes, I got upto about 70% and akali was on 0 so I ALT TAB to play some music while i wait and then I see an alert saying something like, game failed please try again press ok, i press ok go to the after game screen and then it says leavebuster 5 games 20 minutes. So yeah it would be sick if you could fix this up cause this is just that triggering. &lt;3","replies":[{"poster":"BigSheep","date":"2018-11-06T13:55:31.232+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"no reply fair fair.
