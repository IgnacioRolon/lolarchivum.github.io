So you will earn key fragments much faster in your earlier wins than you will in your later wins. Or said another way, each incremental key fragment drop is harder than the last (on average... there is variance). This resets on a monthly basis for each player individually. \nThe goal is to create a nice ebb and flow. \n**Grade does NOT impact key drop chance. **\n**Premades DO increase drop chance. **\nHope that helps clarify \"\n[(source)](http://www.surrenderat20.net/2016/03/red-post-collection-hextech-crafting-on.html#6)\n\nThe only way to increase your key fragment drop rate is to play in a premade. A [user on Reddit estimated that the rate increased by as much as 5%](https://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/4atwfj/hextech_key_fragment_drop_rate_statistics/) when playing in a 5man (not definitive, drop rate varies for each player).  \n\nThe reason behind the low drop rate is to make the system appeal to casual players as well as hardcore players, as explained by Telecasterdude [HERE.](http://boards.oce.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/miscellaneous/tFRfHH2M-key-fragment-drop-rates-and-suggestions?comment=0001)","replies":[{"poster":"BigSheep","date":"2016-04-27T11:19:18.324+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"cheers for the help man!","replies":[]}]}]}
