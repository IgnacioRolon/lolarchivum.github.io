Just like free champs of the week, perhaps award a free skin or a number of free skins temporarily each week for players who have an honor badge.\nRewarding people with an icon is not enough, but a skin may be.\n\n* The other possibility which would have a much more profound effect on people&#039;s behavior, would be to offer an actual in-game buff for honorable players. Nothing OP, but something that gives them an edge.\n\nI&#039;m aware RIOT mentioned they are &quot;experimenting&quot; with the idea already, but I haven&#039;t heard anything since this announcement...","replies":[{"poster":"Akkordian Zoeve","date":"2017-06-16T04:39:31.389+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"I still reckon anyone with an Honour Level of 0 (and perhaps even 1) should have Ranked Queue disabled for them.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Chronicc","date":"2017-06-18T12:25:42.884+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"No, you are stupid.","replies":[]}]}
