We have all been in the position where we put our personal score over the good of the team to get that 1 last token. lvl 7's have been out for a while now and the game hasn't shut down yet.\n\nThis isn't a fair test either, we are in the middle of one of the bigger league events of the year, there are 5x more missions than would be normal, and the missions contribute directly to the event's progress. So theres always going to be more mission hype in this type of event.\n\nAlso, no one is going to farm missions in ranked with no intent of winning. _(not to mention you cant even get 4 people in a group in solo queue.)_\nIf you care so little about ranked that you'd put a couple of mission points above winning, you're just not going to play ranked in the first place! \n\nSo I think encountering this kind of behaviour in ranked would be so rare it probably isn't even worth considering. \n\n________\n\nYou also have to consider the long time players, people who play 4+ games every day, and have done for years and years.\nIt gets to a point where you start thinking _\"Why do I actually play?\"_ you've got all your champs to lvl 7, theres nothing left to strive for. Having little side-missions is a nice boost to these players, it adds a bit more purpose to their games.\n\nI think the missions are good. Personally I've haven't seen any players throw away games to complete missions, but i have seen lots of enjoyment from people trying to earn rewards and try champs they wouldn't usually play.\n\nand the missions are not intense enough to impact games too much.\nNormal missions are like \"Get 5 kills in the next 12 hours.\" Well.... you don't even need to try for that, most champs get that in a single game, not to mention you could just play ARAM if you are that desperate.\n\nI see where you are coming from, but I personally don't think it'll be a problem.","replies":[{"poster":"Tommo020788","date":"2017-06-24T10:14:09.107+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I dislike the whole \"You won't find this issue in ranked, so who cares\" attitude a lot of people have toward issues that come up.\nIts not like normal games don't matter. It matters to me that people try even in normal games.\nI don't play ranked, because I have no interest in putting in heaps of effort to earn a score, just to have it taken down by a raging couple of flaming trolls who can't get along (that DOES happen in ranked as you are climbing). Its not worth the stress.\n\nWhat I'm saying, is normal games matter too. Just because they don't count toward your public score, doesn't mean it should not matter if people put in less effort to teamwork.\nI think surrendering is a great option, because it allows a team to restart a fresh game in cases such as when you have gone 0/40 and its an obvious loss, and two of your lanes are flaming, and one has gone afk because of the flaming etc.\nOr if someone leaves, then comes back, then leaves, then comes back, then leaves. so you can't recall the game because its not picked up as a leaver.\n\nI get all the positive aspects of missions, and I was quite excited about that too, but its super super frustrating when I get players who are just like \"lol idc, I'm just getting my mission. gg\".","replies":[{"poster":"Lord Sesshomaru","date":"2017-06-24T11:01:52.307+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I see what you mean, but I never said normal games dont matter.\nI was just responding to your comment about _\"what if in solo queue...\"_\n\nI actually fall among the people who play more normal than ranked. I probably play 6 normal games for every 1 game of ranked. and I do get disappointed when people ruin my games with their silliness. \n\nHowever, if you are not striving to climb the ranks, then obviously you don't play for the competitive aspect of league, therefore the main reason you play must be for Fun. \n\nBut Fun is different for everyone. \nFor players like you and I, fun means a good close game with fairly meta positions and strategies, _(basically ranked but without the stress)_.\n\nBut for other people who play ranked a lot, are bored of it, and just want to chill. Trying out _AD Crit jungle Bard_ might be their idea of fun!\n\nSo there needs to be a place where people can try AP Yasuo, Crit Bard and AD Thresh without ruining peoples hard earned rankings, and we only have 2 game modes, Ranked and Normal. and if I have to play with an _AD Crit jungle Bard_, id hella prefer it happened in normals than ranked. Likewise if someone is chasing lvl 7, or trying to get a mission 30 minutes before the deadline. \n\nSo as much as we might want it to be, we can't expect normals to be an exact replica of ranked but just without the stress, because we aren't the only players looking for fun. \n\nSo no, normals is not unimportant, but you cant expect it to be taken as seriously as ranked. Because there needs to be a place where players can just have fun, in whatever form that takes.\n\nMissions might be the absolute best thing about league to certain people, and they cant think of anything more fun then chasing down quests with your favourite champs.\nWould you tell them _\"Sorry you cant do that, because you doing it means I can't do what I want!\"_?\n\nIf you choose to play normals, you do have to accept that people want do do different things for fun, and occasionally it wont be what you want them to do. The only things that aren't acceptable are toxicity and intentionally ruining the game for others. \n\n_________\n\nThe crux of it is this:\nThere will always be people who are just dicks at heart.\nAnd they will always be there causing trouble no matter wether missions are there or not.\nmissions just happen to be a way for them to channel it. If you took missions out, they would cause just as much trouble trolling or chasing lvl 7 support Zed or whatever. \n\nIt's like religion. \nReligion doesn't make violent extremists. Violent extremists just use religion as a way to channel their violent natures.\nIf religion didn't exist, bombers would just kill people in the name of political agendas or global warming or whatever they can find.\n\nJust like league, people will be dicks no matter what, missions don't cause it, it just happens to be the easiest way for them to channel their inner dick.  Take missions away, and the same people will do the same kind of thing, but about something else.\n\nIt is better for us to focus on the players themselves. \nIf they are really being a nuisance in every game, then the system will take action.","replies":[]},{"poster":"dragon poo","date":"2017-06-24T10:53:36.540+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Normals count, but ranked is where you should be going to tryhard, even if it's flex, if i play normals, im playing attack speed blitzcranks jungle or something dumb, or rapidfire cannon hecarim.","replies":[]}]}]}]}
