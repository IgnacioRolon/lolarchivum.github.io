Don&#039;t bother giving me that hollow answer. This is a team game, and if I am forced to &quot;mute&quot; a player on my own team, because they are flaming players on our team, that makes my gaming experience worse. period.\r\n------------------------------------------------\r\nWhere Is The Tribunal?-\r\n------------------------------------------------\r\nI remember reading a while ago that RIOT was looking into &quot;making adjustments&quot; to the tribunal, and in the meantime they would remove it and add an automated system.\r\nThe reason they had for taking down the tribunal, was because apparently people weren&#039;t getting swift enough punishment...\r\nI remember seeing that glorious popup saying &quot;a player has received disciplinary action for their unsportsmanlike behavior thanks to your report&quot;, and that would happen sometimes soon after the report.\r\nBut ever since the tribunal has been removed, I NEVER get to feel like something is being done about players like this, and I have noticed MORE negative players since the removal of the tribunal.\r\n\r\nAre we actually ever going to get the tribunal back? Or was this new &quot;petty rewards for honor&quot; system supposed to be test grounds for phasing it out completely?\r\n\r\nThis is a great game, but the culture of thinking its cool to insult and flame people needs to be expelled like the cancerous tumor it is on this game.\r\nI have not experienced this level of bad behavior in ANY OTHER game.\r\nI get that sometimes people get upset, and say nasty stuff in the moment, but this plague is more than that. its a culture that is being created due to  tolerance.\r\n\r\nPlease RIOT, take this issue seriously, and show us you are serious about it, because nothing else has worked since you removed the tribunal.","replies":[{"poster":"Lord Sesshomaru","date":"2017-06-25T09:17:26.769+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"You say that the system isn't working. Everyone always does. \nBut no one ever has any proof of this. \n\nMostly because the system has never been turned off, so they have no idea how bad it would be without it.\nI think you would find that in the absence of the player behaviour systems, the game would be a hell of a lot worse.\n\nPeople expect Riot to 'fix' the problem.\nBut they don't realise that the problem isn't something that can be 'fixed'.\nLeague of Legends is both **anonymous** and **highly competitive**. \nIn any aspect of life, if you have just 1 of the above categories, you will have toxic behaviour, and league has an excess of both. \nThere will always be people who display unsportsmanlike behaviour, that is just a fact. \n**There is no solution to that.**\n\n\nThe best Riot can do, is weed out the worst people, in such a way that doesn't disadvantage ordinary players. \n\nA Tribunal can't do that, a Tribunal isn't impartial. Players want vengeance not justice, a tribunal is just an avenue for players to punish other players.\nEven you yourself say how 'glorious' it was seeing the popup saying your enemies have been punished for crossing you. \nThat feeling is no less than vengeance. They ruined your game and now they're gone! Justice has been served!\n\nJustice? No.\nPersonal gratification? Yes.\n\nJustice is blind. \nSo is an impartial system.\n\nAn impartial automated system doesnt operate with the prejudices of a Tribunal, it treats everyone equally and without the vengeance players want to inflict on each other. \n\nYes it lets a few players off the hook that would otherwise have been punished, but it means that innocent players don't fall victim to the prejudices of others.","replies":[{"poster":"trolledallmylife","date":"2017-06-25T12:48:25.454+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":2,"body":"no solution? \n\nI will give you a few with NO FLAWS OR NEG SIDE EFFECTS BESIDES RIOT MAKING LESS MONEY \n\n1.

No one likes ID verification. I won't make accounts on many websites purely because they ask for too much information that isn't needed for the function of the site _(E.G. you don't need my phone number and address to let me access academic papers in the public domain... so I'm not going to give them to you.)_, and no one wants to give their life story just so they can play a free online game, that'll put a lot of potential players off. It also means you can't make a low-level account to help friends who are just starting, or make an account in another region.\n\n2. This means there is no room for reform, and players need the chance to be punished and give it a second go, a great many of them do improve, this will stop that, not to mention completely screw over players who aren't usually toxic but just happen to go through a really bad week or two.\n\n3. Somehow I don't think that'd be a great idea in a semi-strategy game that requires lots of communication.\nIt'll also screw over ranked queues. Duos will communicate over discord, giving them a huge advantage over solo players who can't communicate at all with other platers. Not to mention this solution only stops verbal abuse, it does nothing against trolls and smurfs and the like. \n\nSo there are plenty of negative side effects you haven't considered.\n\nPlus riot making less money is a big side effect.\nDon't forget that if they didn't make so much money, we wouldn't have as many _(or as quality)_ skins and champions, not to mention no fun events like ocean week or VS. and I think music videos from famous bands like 'Imagine Dragons' for worlds would be a no no as well.\n\nThere is no silver bullet to completely stop bad behaviour.","replies":[{"poster":"trolledallmylife","date":"2017-06-25T13:29:21.747+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"No one said they will completely stop it? \n\nIt would help A LOT!

Solve implying the end of the problem. \n\nAnd they aren't doing nothing, their systems work quite well.\nAnd doing 'nothing' is better than disadvantaging innocent players. Which is the inevitable result if you ramp up the punishments.\n\nSure it's unlikely that a person telling someone's family to die will reform. However that isn't the only thing people get reported for.\nRiot wants us to report people who say \"GG EZ\". Which of course isn't a nice thing to say, but they should hardly be banned for life because of it. \n\nEven then, someone's pet died, they failed their exams, their GF broke up with them, theres many reasons why a perfectly respectable player might lose it in game. Do they deserve to be banned for life because they've had a terrible week and made a mistake? Have you never lost your cool on a bad day?\n\nIm not sure what you use chat for, but I use it every game to communicate with my team, coordinate dragons and pushing, as well as general motivation.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Main Line","date":"2017-06-27T05:03:26.654+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Lord Sesshomaru,realm=OCE,application-id=T8eq2lFQ,discussion-id=ki2mmeKe,comment-id=000000000000,timestamp=2017-06-25T13:07:22.612+0000)\n> \n> There is no silver bullet to completely stop bad behaviour.\n\nBut if you consider what happens in Korea, it's quite good that they need an ID of some sort, cuts out a lot of issues. Players are more serious about improving at the game, and that's why their soloqueue is by far the highest quality of the regions.\nWhen players sign up for the game, they agree to a terms of service. Reforming is fine, but they can do it on a NEW ACCOUNT if they got banned.\nIt's because the other regions are band-aided to continue Riot's revenue service that the game is constantly on a higher level of toxic.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Bad Place Touch","date":"2017-07-20T13:35:59.472+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I think I've played with this bloke before.

You will notice lol is far worse than most.\n\nI mean come on, saying \"there's no proof\" is just silly, its pretty damn self evident and everyone knows it. That is why everyone says so.\nAlso, you want proof, and say \"everyone always\" says the system does not work. That would be stating that everyone agrees the issue is there, and is witness to the issue.\nWitnesses in such a large number would serve as the proof you need.\n\nAnyway, moving on from that pointless aspect of your comment,\nYou say there is an issue with feeling glorious when someone is punished for being outright abusive toward you.\nIf you wanna be all lawyer like, this also is an important part of \"justice\". If you ever sit in on a trial of say an armed robbery charge, the victim wanting that person to be locked up is a large part of the decision to lock them up or not.\nWhat the community wants as a whole also weighs heavily on the decision.\nWould you say the victim would feel good when that person is punished for abusing them? Sure. Does that mean the system is impartial? No not really. It works.\n\nAgain, pretty pointless argument there.\nYou can nit pick at the wording in what I said, sure that's fine, but the substance of what I'm saying is true, and most people agree with it.\n\nYes, a tribunal would allow players to punish other players.... But not the players who you reported yourself obviously.\nIt takes the automated aspect out of the picture which causes people to get banned for unfair reasons, and it puts a number of humans (just like a jury) in the decision making chair, and if there isn't unanimous agreement, no punishment is passed. That is fair, and it works. An automated system that banns people based on an algorithm is not going to be effective with a MORAL issue.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Exarch Leona","date":"2017-07-09T17:06:56.484+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"You're...........you're joking right?\nNo way the system is working, if you played (HA, im funny, i know) you'd see it in action (well lack of), tonight ive had a number of people int feed and troll solely because \"LUL SCRUWYU, KEK, EDGEY AF\" and just making the game look like a public toilet after someones gone in with explosive diarrhea .","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"blued","date":"2017-07-17T03:34:24.743+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"LoL (especially OCE region) has the worse community of players.
