I&#039;ve racked up around 1.1k hours, along with 500 hours more of my other account (which i forgot email, password, username to). Somehow, League just doesn&#039;t have that pull to it anymore. I remember staying up most nights to play league, and I often would stay up until  1 or 2, playing with my friends. I would be ecstatic every time my parents let me play. However, those days are over. League just seems so... repetitive. Maybe it&#039;s because I&#039;ve played it for a decent amount of time, but I don&#039;t know. Like, if I play it with some friends, on the weekends for an hour or two, than it would be sort of fun. But playing it for many hours, dedicating yourself to the match just doesn&#039;t seem worth it anymore. I&#039;ve tried other MOBA games like DoTA 2, Smite, H.O.T.S, and they all seemed more interesting. (especially DoTA when you can just smash the shit out of trees and whack people with it; yes, I judge games for those small moments)\r\n\r\nNow don&#039;t get me wrong, I still love League.  But let me just ask you guys a question:Are there any people who feel the same as me? If so, is there any way I could sort of get back into League? Because playing other games just feel weird. Like FPS games. Especially FPS games.\r\n\r\nThanks!","replies":[{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2018-08-22T14:14:18.581+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Personally the League experience has changed a lot since I started back in season 3. There came a point about 2-3 years in when I wouldn't even think of playing the game on my own anymore, it became a much more social experience for me. I was never super competitive to begin with and rarely bother with ranked even now, but where I used to play games on my own because there was that discovery element to the game, now I play it to be friendly.\n\nI still very much enjoy the game, just in a different way. The pull is less \"look an exciting new thing to discover or try!\" (though that feeling still comes back with events and the like) and more a great way to hang out with the mates, have fun, tell each other how bad we are. Like any other social sport really.","replies":[{"poster":"Siv HA","date":"2018-08-23T00:53:06.216+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thanks!","replies":[]}]}]}
