Tried leaving it over night & still nothing. Gone through and done every single thing thats under player support and still nothing.

Anyone got any solutions either would be much appreciated.","replies":[{"poster":"HORSE OF FORCE","date":"2015-01-17T05:49:10.165+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Getting the exact same problem, and I have tried many, many things (DNS, ISP change, admin mode/disable UAC, reinstall/download)\n\nSeems like nothing sort of just getting a new computer will fix this.","replies":[{"poster":"kers 225","date":"2015-01-17T07:58:39.822+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Look man I went down to a friends place and his patch installed just fine. Copy and place it onto a USB and delete all of your Riot Games files from your c drive or wherever you put it and replace it with the ones you have obtained from a friend.
