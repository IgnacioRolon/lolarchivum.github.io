You're probably not going to kill many different people and Oppressor works well with Teemo. Rylai's is pretty common and shrooms are increased damage by default.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Wuks","date":"2016-02-03T09:18:20.594+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Bounty hunter, in my opinion. Teemo late game should be able to secure a bunch of kills in the early to mid-game, creating some pretty heavy nuke mushrooms. However, if you don't seem to be getting kills with Teemo or tend to lose the early game pretty hard, Oppressor is definitely a safer pick at the cost of a potential 2.5% in the later stages of the match.","replies":[]}]}
