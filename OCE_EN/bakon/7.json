I'm not a Shaco God or anything, but I do know a couple of tricks.\n\n- Shaco is probably like the best invader in game so always look for opportunitys to surprise your enemy jg with a smite steal.\n- Remember that you always start at a buff and start placing your W at 44 seconds for maximum affect, don't smite the buff as you will need it for my next strategy\n- I usually get my Q second, then use it to quickly get to the enemy buff and either A) Steal it with smite if they are currently taking it, then try to go for first blood if you are in a good position to do so B) Just simply take it if they started at the other buff.\n\nSo yeah when I usually do these things as Shaco I either end up setting my enemy jungler a shit ton behind or snowballing or both. Then continue to make people tilt as you half their health with your E :)","replies":[]},{"poster":"Requiemsfire","date":"2016-08-03T10:50:29.011+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Well I'm not a main, but from what I've seen......\n\nAP Shaco\n>Relies on Boxes and clone dying to deal damage, easier to bait with the clone and watch it take half an enemies HP\n>Stacking boxes in a single area works to insta kill someone\nCrit Shaco\n>Crit shaco works because of his passive on his Q and deals a substantial amount of burst while losing some in sustain until later on that is\n\nAD Shaco:\nLacks as much burst as crit shaco but makes for it in sustain and movement speed, good in CC comps. \nTips include:\nFocus on positioning yourself behind the enemy, \nplace a box behind you or somewhere close so that you can bait enemies into them and ambush them easily,\npotentially cheese dragon at level 6\nUse boxes for jungle clear\n\nJust by looking at his kit i would reccomend warrior into youmuus into infinity edge or statik shiv","replies":[]},{"poster":"Łæoña","date":"2016-08-03T10:47:18.924+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I don't play shake but I have a friend who does. Apparently AD shaco is really strong. He goes with AD/Attackspeed/crit so something like the blue jg item enchanted by warriors with statik shiv + i.e. Most shaco players go with ignite and smite since you have your Q but you can go with flash and smite.","replies":[]}]}
