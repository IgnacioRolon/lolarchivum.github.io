Double Edged Sword is great for 1v1 dueling but only gives YOU the 3% bonus damage. \n\nExpose Weakness is an amazing mastery point! 3% on your entire team in a fight is significant!","replies":[]},{"poster":"Olee","date":"2016-03-12T05:20:25.905+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"lol","replies":[]},{"poster":"WE WUZ KINGZ","date":"2016-03-12T03:46:49.816+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yes, because I read patch notes.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Deep Terror Nami","date":"2016-03-11T23:16:04.317+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"They added it in 6.4.","replies":[]}]}
