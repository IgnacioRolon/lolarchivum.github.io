Your mushrooms are alot weaker with this and serve mainly as a slow and vision control but you become a major pain in the ass for the enemy team and your stealth becomes the stuff of nightmares because this not a teemo build you can 1v1. You're somewhat tanky and a few of the items can be changed depending on your matchup. If they don't stack magic resist, rylias is better than mallet.","replies":[{"poster":"Nightjar","date":"2016-07-22T07:15:23.365+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"oh and it's funny as hell to run around the map, slowing people and moving at the speed of light and being chased around the map after coming out of stealth and deleting someone on the enemy team.
