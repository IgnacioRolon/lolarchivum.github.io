His/her&#039;s q could be that he/she does heaps of slashes (in melee form) and shoot something abit like ezreal (ranged). Finally this champ could have his/she&#039;s ult to either give him/her a completely new weapon or kinda like heimerdinger&#039;s ult can upgrade the weapon that is equiped. This champ would probably be based around basic attacks, so his/her biggest counters would be Quinn and Teemo. So in my opinion this would be a fun champ and could go top lane and ad carry","replies":[{"poster":"Urgot Bot","date":"2015-05-09T16:09:07.265+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"he/she his/her he/she his/her\n\nthis is all im seeing and its annoying the hell out of me.","replies":[{"poster":"ShuffledPancake","date":"2015-05-09T16:17:47.706+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"there are words called there and it or them idk just options Kappa","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"ShuffledPancake","date":"2015-05-09T09:12:44.274+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"So Jayce?
