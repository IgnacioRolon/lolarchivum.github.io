This light you have known all your life, it has resided within you, and it has surrounded you, everyone you have ever seen, ever come in contact with has this light within them also. It is so much a part of you and your world that you barely register that it is there.&rdquo;\r\n \r\n&ldquo;But now imagine it is gone.&rdquo;\r\n \r\n&ldquo;You are alone; you don&rsquo;t quite remember why. But that has been taken from you without your permission. The people around you have disappeared; the once warm glow is replaced by a chilling darkness that floods your every sense. You can&rsquo;t walk for your muscles are frozen, you can&rsquo;t speak because the air that fills your lungs feels like it has somehow turned to liquid and chilled to ice. You cannot see, as there is no light.&rdquo;\r\n \r\n&ldquo;You feel a presence. You know, instinctively, that because of this presence you will never feel that warmth again, never see that light. You are forever trapped in the darkness with this presence that causes every inch of you to shiver, not because of the cold, but because of the fear. This fear does not coil around you. It does not gently gnaw upon the edges of your subconscious. No, this fear devours you whole; this fear digs its claws deep into your mind and drags you down into the inky black abyss of loneliness and despair.&rdquo;\r\n \r\n&ldquo;The presence draws ever closer, you know it has come for you. You can almost, even in this pitch black nothingness, see its lanky pale figure looming above you. How his long black hair hangs down over its face, obscuring the soulless, endless pits of its eyes. You hear how almost every ragged breath is a death rattle in and of itself. The figure&rsquo;s long fingers, more bone than flesh, reach out toward you. You cannot run. You cannot scream. You can do nothing but succumb and wait for it to claim you.&rdquo;\r\n \r\n&ldquo;This being welcomed all when the light faded and failed. He took them into his embrace. Everyone will met this being, from kings to slaves, the strongest warriors and most powerful magicians to the humblest of farmers. But he was alone and without a friend, for all he claimed feared him above all else. He was forever tormented by the lingering warmth that soon drained from all who came to him.&rdquo;\r\n \r\n&ldquo;Tired of the endless darkness and the rejection, he reached through the darkness and plucked an axe from the world of light. Already he could feel the wood that held the blade in place rotting in his grasp. So, with a swift and mighty swing, he cut himself in half.&rdquo;\r\n \r\nDo you know why the being did this, Dearest Wolf?\r\n \r\nSo he would never be alone.\r\nSo he would never be alone.\r\n \r\nSo we would never be alone...\r\n\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\nThe large shadow beast stood triumphantly over the body of an old man, his long white hair matted with blood and his dark toned skin torn from his flesh. Wolf looked down upon the kill, &ldquo;The hunt was long and exciting little Lamb!&rdquo; Lamb however sounded sombre and quiet, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m glad you enjoyed your hunt dear Wolf.&rdquo;\r\n&ldquo;Then why do you sound so sad? Did you wish to hunt this one?&rdquo; Wolf questioned, sniffing at Lamb, &ldquo;You may take the next one then!&rdquo;\r\n&ldquo;There will be but one more hunt, dear Wolf. There are no more but us in this world.&rdquo;\r\n&ldquo;Then how can we hunt again?&rdquo; The wolf&rsquo;s eyes widened as he came to realise he had taken the last kill; no more could he hunt through the trees and concrete jungles. No more would he feel the snapping of bone and the tearing of flesh in his teeth. All at once he felt a crushing despair.\r\n&ldquo;There is but one more hunt.&rdquo; Lamb repeated as she caressed her companion&rsquo;s shaggy black jaw with her own delicate silver hand.\r\n&ldquo;Will you run from the hunt, little Lamb?&rdquo; Sadness crept into the powerful being&rsquo;s voice.\r\n&ldquo;I will never run from you, dear Wolf. Will you take my arrow peacefully?&rdquo;\r\n&ldquo;I could never accept the silence without you Lamb. I do not want this hunt. I do not want the quiet.&rdquo;\r\n&ldquo;But we must. You know we must.&rdquo;\r\n&ldquo;Run Lamb, run across the deserts and seas, over mountain and through cavern so that we may always be together. I do not wish to see your shining beauty stained.&rdquo;\r\n&ldquo;We would never be truly together dear Wolf, I do not wish to see your howl silenced, nor your hunt brought to an end.&rdquo;\r\n&ldquo;But no matter the outcome we will only see one more hunt.&rdquo;\r\n&ldquo;No matter what, Wolf, always remember... We are never one...&rdquo;\r\n&ldquo;Without the other....&rdquo;\r\n\r\nWolf stood over his successful hunt once more, however there was no triumphant glee, only a crushing darkness that he could feel encroaching. Lamb however, lay upon the ground her beautiful silver wool, once pristine and shining in the moonlight, now was dull and fading.\r\n&ldquo;Do not leave me Lamb. We promised. We would always have a friend. I do not want to be alone...&rdquo;\r\nLamb once more caressed her friend&rsquo;s powerful jaw with her own weak and now trembling hand, &ldquo;Fear not Wolf. Perhaps we will find one another once more. There is always a chance.&rdquo;\r\n&ldquo;I am afraid, do not leave.&rdquo;\r\n&ldquo;Shall I tell you a story before I go?&rdquo;\r\n&ldquo;One close to your heart?&rdquo;\r\n&ldquo;One closest to my heart.&rdquo;\r\n&ldquo;I will listen...&rdquo;\r\n&ldquo;There was once a mighty Wolf... His muscles strong, his fur as black as night... He had claws that could tear skin and mighty teeth that could rend flesh...&rdquo;\r\n\r\nThe once great and mighty Wolf sat back and tilted his head toward the great silver full moon. Wolf whimpered at the memory of his dearest little friend and howled long and loud. There was no more Lamb to hum to him when there was no hunt to occupy him, no Lamb to talk to about the world that had for so long confused him.\r\n\r\nThe sorrowful howl tore through the deafening silence; it rolled across the vast desert and wide oceans, it reached the highest mountain and pierced the deepest cavern, so that no matter where Lamb was, she would hear him calling and find her way back...","replies":[{"poster":"Blizzard Fang","date":"2016-07-21T08:46:33.918+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"good read","replies":[{"poster":"Kindr3dSpirits","date":"2016-07-27T16:19:59.391+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thanks. <3","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"MagiKyubi27","date":"2017-01-25T02:38:08.090+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"pretty nice. i made one where a energetic and carefree child meets them at a young age, then kindred mysteriously dissapears for 80 years, only to be found that fate meets them again, but not for a friendly visit. it's like double the contest thing though, grant i bet that's already up XD","replies":[]},{"poster":"The Wanak King","date":"2016-09-29T00:01:26.351+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Kindred Yorick Confirmed :D","replies":[]},{"poster":"BurningAvalanche","date":"2016-08-25T09:16:50.564+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"amazing, love the story, 10/10","replies":[]},{"poster":"CourtJesster","date":"2016-07-25T01:59:22.527+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I loved this so much.
