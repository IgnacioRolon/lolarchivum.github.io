The worse is when you get your role and someone decides to dodge cause they had a champ ban or taken from them, but when you get another pop, you're the one that gets auto filled after having your lane for the last draft. Can you actually make it that if someone dodges their que that when you get into another match you actually get your same role you were given before. I don't care if it take another 2 minutes to find that role. This is actually forcing me to dodge and jump on my other account cause its frustrating having been auto filled when it says that i have protection at times.","replies":[{"poster":"bgentle2myashe","date":"2019-12-16T06:50:54.381+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I don't pretend to know much about the queue system but I know the more factors you add to any system the more complicated it gets. The more complicated it gets the more bugs occur and equally more people complain and so on. At some point you have to weigh up the pro's and con's of luxuries compared with necessities and consequences for both. \nI'm faily certain that auto fill is a last resort to a point. As I said I don't know the math but riot would be trying to cut queue times by a certain percentage to justify making someone auto fill because not so long ago queue times was one of riots biggest issues by feedback.\nHaving said all that your experience might be different but you shouldn't get very many auto fill occurrences when you are selecting a specific role.  If you are then maybe it is a good opportunity to work on every role so it becomes a strength rather than a weakness. I know it's not ideal or as much fun but if you have an issue you can either bang your head on a brick wall to fix it or do something productive.","replies":[{"poster":"Nightjar","date":"2019-12-17T08:05:45.238+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I just wish when I queue duo for ranked with my friend, and he picks Top/Mid and I pick Sup/Jg, that I don't get autofilled Top and he get's autofilled Support.\n\nLike I know we can just swap because we're premade, but it just feels like a small change could have made it so much simpler, and I do wonder how often this occurs to nonpremades, and how much it makes autofill feel worse.","replies":[]}]}]}
