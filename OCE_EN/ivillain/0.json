The final week will be the playoffs where the top 2 teams of that tournament will be invited to play in OCS promotion tournament and ultimately a spot in the OPL.\n \nEarlier this year we saw an average of 57 teams playing each weekend throughout the split. It is the training grounds for which teams can hone their expertise in a competitive environment as well as gain invaluable experience for the future.\n \nAnyone can enter the OOL, and not every team will have to compete every week. However, competitive teams will gain a natural edge if they play every week consistently for maximum amount of circuit points to make playoffs.\n\n\n**How can I sign up?**\n\nYour Path to Pro can be found on Battlefy here!\nhttps://battlefy.com/riot-games-oceanic-open-ladder\nTeams are capped to the first 160 registrations so grab your team and sign up for the tournaments now!\n\n \n**What is the schedule?**\n\nWeek 1 Tournament (July 1 ~ July 2)\nWeek 2 Tournament (July 15 ~ July 16)\nWeek 3 Tournament (July 29 ~ July 30)\nWeek 4 Tournament (August 12 ~ August 13)\nWeek 5 Playoff Tournament  (August 26 ~ August 27)\n\nDates are also available on our Leagues Page, or our OOL Battlefy website (Where you also sign up) \n\n**Is there Prizing?**\n\nPrizes shown are per player:\n\n1st &ndash; 3200 RP + Triumphant Ryze\n2nd &ndash; 2800 RP\n3rd &ndash; 2100 RP\n4th &ndash; 1100 RP\n5th-8th &ndash; 800 RP\n9th-16th &ndash; 500 RP\n\n**How do I qualify to the OCS?**\n\nIn the simplest terms by gaining circuit points! Each week your team plays in OOL they&rsquo;ll grab the chance to earn points to qualify for end of split\nplayoffs and then for a spot in the OCS. The more tournaments you play in the more points your team stands to win; note that although only the\ntop 2 teams of each group from day 1 preliminaries will move onto day 2 playoffs, every point counts so every game matters!\n\nAfter the four weeks the top 8 teams with the most circuit points earned throughout the split will play in the playoffs and the top 2 will play in the OCS promotion tournament.\n\n\n\n**Preliminaries (Day 1) Points**\n\n1st &ndash; 20 points\n2nd &ndash; 15 points\n3rd &ndash; 10 points\n4th &ndash; 5 points\n5th &ndash; 0 points\n\n**Playoffs (Day 2) Points**\n\n1st Place &ndash; 90 points\n2nd Place &ndash; 60 points\n3rd Place &ndash; 40 points\n4th Place &ndash; 30 points\n5 ~ 8th Place &ndash; 20 points\n9th ~ 16th Place &ndash; 10 points\n17th ~ 32nd Place &ndash; 5 points\n\nFor those who need to find the rules for competing within the OOL, they can be found [here](http://bit.ly/2sC116S)!\n \nIf that doesn&rsquo;t quite cut it, the Battlefy website once again has all of your needs fulfilled\nhttps://battlefy.com/riot-games-oceanic-open-ladder\n \nYou can find the current standings for circuit points here! http://bit.ly/2tBV9cq\n \nWe&rsquo;re excited to see this split of the OOL kick off and both old and new summoners returning to the rift!

Contact them through the discord group!\n\n\nCheers,\n\niVillain","replies":[{"poster":"Doomskull","date":"2017-07-17T07:02:29.757+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"anyone else notice that week 1 and 2 of this tournament has already passed, and this announcement came out 9 hours ago?\nis anyone noticing this or am I reading it wrong, and if so, I'm sorry.","replies":[{"poster":"Hymir","date":"2017-07-17T07:38:51.664+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"it's been up for 21 days, but they only put it on the ingame launcher today..

Myself and a bunch of my mates were looking forward to this split, and stupidly expected it to be advertised through the client. \nI know OPL (and the leagues leading up to it) are relatively minor leagues through the eyes of Riot and the rest of the world, but with a lack of attention for stuff like OOL, it's no surprise we aren't growing.\nHopefully we'll have more notice next time around.","replies":[{"poster":"belquin","date":"2017-07-19T00:54:22.399+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'm a big believer in the pathways to the OPL and the amateur leagues which allow participation. There's currently quite a large gap between solo queue and professional play due to the nature of solo compared to playing as a 5 man unit. Things like the OOL and OCS really help to bridge this gap and set up new players to grow into the OPL.\n\nSo yeah, I definitely agree that we need some more attention on the path to pro to ensure sustainable growth and development at the highest level. Thanks for taking the time to reinforce that message - we hear you.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"belquin","date":"2017-07-18T00:01:47.473+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"{{summoner:14}} Totally fair comment Turlo.
