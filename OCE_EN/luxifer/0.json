I&#039;d love to hear ideas to improve it though.\r\n\r\nSo, what if team spirit skins were rewarded for teamwork (team spirit) honours? It&#039;d be a nice reward, and the players would strive to have better teamwork skills because they get more than a label. There could be skins for Teemo {{champion:17}}, Ezreal {{champion:81}}, Anivia {{champion:34}} (a team spirit skin for her is already made but unavailable), and Malzahar {{champion:90}}. (I spelled team in that if nobody noticed)\r\n\r\nWhat do you guys think of this, and should we change the champions?\r\n\r\nThanks for reading :D","replies":[{"poster":"Essembie","date":"2015-08-25T19:08:20.508+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"For stinky players under 20, kurt Cobain approves","replies":[]},{"poster":"CryptozoicMan","date":"2015-08-25T16:43:44.680+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The team spirit anivia has nothing to do with 'team spirit\" its a legacy skin which was released for the winter olympics im pretty sure.
