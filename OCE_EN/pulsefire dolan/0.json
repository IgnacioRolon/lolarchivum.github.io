Badassss!\n\nNo of course this game isn't about whoever is the biggest \"badass\", but if someone told you to kill yourself would you just turn around and walk away? If you are THAT nice of a person maybe but not everyone is like that, if someone said that to me I would get up at the guy.\n \n\"Hey dude, what the fuck, that was rude\" \n\"What is wrong with you?\" \n\"Wow this guy is such an ass\"\n\nAll perfectly humane responses to something like that but Riot would see it as flaming in chat and you get punished for it.\nSure you say \"don't fight fire with fire\" but there's a difference between responding like:\n\"Haha stfu you little bitch I'll beat you up irl\"\nand\n\"What the fuck is wrong with you asshole, how could you say that\"\n\nI feel as though the feedback report system needs to consider situations like this.","replies":[]},{"poster":"trolledallmylife","date":"2017-08-23T09:16:23.443+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":2,"body":"Yes Riots solution to everything is to \"MUTE THEM\" lol!\n\nWhat a JOKE!\n\nIf someone is beating your mother on the street Riot devs would tell you to \"MUTE THEM\" lol!\n\nGlad I stopped playing this game!","replies":[]},{"poster":"opL RPNUP","date":"2017-08-28T22:29:59.107+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Tomblade,realm=OCE,application-id=T8eq2lFQ,discussion-id=Lx6YuUuo,comment-id=0003,timestamp=2017-08-23T04:57:26.198+0000)\n>\n> Hi Pulsefire Dolan!\n> \n> As others have mentioned, you should have received an email with the specific chat lines that triggered your ban.

You offer a half ass solution when you should really stop it before it becomes a bigger issue. One would think after all these years that OCE has been running you would've learned, adapted and improved. Since the start of OCE I've only seen minor changes or improvements. Re-evaluate your punishment system to intercept toxicity from the start.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Project Xayah","date":"2017-08-22T12:42:26.255+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Can you tell us what the ban was for? You should have been notified which category it falls under when you received the ban.\n\nIf it is a chat related ban, then without a look at the chat logs, it's impossible to tell whether it was unfair. There's no indication whether you truly were a victim or whether you started as a victim but then contributed to a bad situation by being toxic yourself. As Aidan has already stated, you should have received an email and/or notification with the relevant chat logs, which you can feel free to post here for the community to discuss.\n\nIf you truly think the ban is unfair or made in error you can submit a ticket to [Support](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us) to appeal (you can also contact them if you have not received the relevant chat logs, or if you're unsure what you were actually banned for). They will take you through the process and make a decision on whether to revoke the ban or not.","replies":[]},{"poster":"trolledallmylife","date":"2017-08-23T09:19:31.441+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"\"You have previously been banned for consistent, moderate to high levels of negative and unsportsmanlike behaviour, including - what I gathered from skimming the chatlogs - intention to tilt or grieve players on your own team for amusement.\"\n\nLOL another troll that has IQ of 1 lol! \n\nI tell trolls not to cry on forums when I tell them they will be banned for trolling/feeding/etc \n\nLove seeing threads like this \n\nToo bad this troll can just take 10 secs to create another account and troll/feed/etc again!\n\ngg riot","replies":[]},{"poster":"Aidan7787","date":"2017-08-22T11:45:19.779+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You would have recieved an email with a list of what you said.
