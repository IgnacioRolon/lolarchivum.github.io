We we're in champion select about third pick for out team. \r\n(I had already selected a champion [Mantheon - lol i know ;) ] )\r\nWhen my computer decides to turn off, I'm thinking okay, power has switch because of a fuse. \r\nIt turns out that my whole block lost power, So I figure well shit it'll be a couple of hours I'll just go to sleep.\r\nOnly to find then next day when I go to play, I have received a leave buster penalty because the Riot client couldn't for \r\nthe life of itself figure out that I have disconnected before the game had even begun. (stab at efficiency)\r\nNow I'm waiting in 20 minute queues for probably a minimum for 5 games and it is hell; (worse than the \"ELO\" kind)\r\nIn no way am I expecting anything from this except maybe to laugh at someone else 'Missfortune' that they share.\r\nSimilar stories anyone? Laugh at my pain. \r\n\r\nRegards \r\nStaples","replies":[{"poster":"Project Xayah","date":"2015-01-30T03:53:55.600+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"***","replies":[{"poster":"Bluestaples","date":"2015-02-03T00:24:32.337+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You should also note that I was just sharing and not particularly having a 'go' at their Leave Buster system. \nYou missed the point of the post, here's 5 points take them to the lamens section of the forums.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Rok","date":"2015-01-30T04:52:05.589+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=HeartVine,realm=OCE,application-id=Ntey9fRZ,discussion-id=VAXsQR1N,comment-id=0001,timestamp=2015-01-30T03:53:55.600+0000)\n>\n> How the hell would it figure out that you exited the client due to your comp turning off due to a blackout? Just please tell me that. Even if it could do something along those line such a system would be highly abuse-able as people could just disconnect their comp from power or shut it down or disconnect their internet connection when they want to dodge. Think about things before you complain about them.\n\nWell here is the thing, he says that he was 3rd pick, meaning the Pick and Ban phase was still in progress. At this point ***someone who leaves the queue REGARDLESS of reason***(be it, Internet DC, Comp Shut down, Exit Client, Power Outage)***the queue should automatically drop the game before it starts*** (meaning that in theory, it is meant to stop this exact thing from happening and having an impact on the game, obviously the system FAILED to pick up that he had disconnected and did NOT drop the game like INTENDED.)\n\n>Think about things before you complain about them.\n\nLikewise, you should re-read what has been written before you make an ass of yourself. His post was not about having a system that can detect the SPECIFIC outage reason, rather, why the system failed to abort the match when it was meant to.\n\n>because the Riot client couldn't for\nthe life of itself figure out that I have disconnected before the game had even begun. (stab at efficiency)\n\nThis is what OP was having a go at, which i concur, it SHOULD have figured out that he had disconnected before the game commenced, and by protocol, aborted the match before it started.\n\nI would send a Support Tickets saying, \"Hey, i think there was/is a problem with this part of the matchmaking system, could you investigate.\"","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Fog","date":"2015-01-30T01:57:38.763+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Better than seeing this on your main.","replies":[{"poster":"SumCoolAid","date":"2015-01-30T02:18:54.423+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Not even that far off now.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Slim Chaedi","date":"2015-02-03T01:04:19.065+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'm rather sure you can be punished for leaving queue too much as well, so you could have been punished even if it did realise you were gone, It is ridiculous that the game still went ahead though, and that is an issue with the client itself. Have you noticed when you close the game it sends data to the server beforehand though? Your computer has to tell the server that it is disconnecting otherwise it will not know this for an unspecified time. Maybe this is something Riot should address though, since this is something which I'm sure has not affected only you. Not sure what they'd do about it though.","replies":[]}]}
