I have the last 5 Minutes of my desktop when i got home and seeing the banned message (From shadowplay)\n\nEDIT: Found out the reason why most people got banned was for MkLoL which i used 5 months ago and uninstalled after i was warned.\n\nWhy did riot wait 5 MONTHS until they send a perma ban for a software that gives you CLIENT SIDE SKINS its just so saddening that after using $80 dollars on a game to get banned for using a software (Which Btw didn't know was illegal until 24Hr ban. Riot you have a alert system use it people don't check there emails) that i stoppped using when told that it was illegal is just such a bad practice to use as a company.\n\nI've made a ticket only getting bot responses {{sticker:zombie-nunu-bummed}} \n\nEDIT 2 : I got unbanned the help support ticket said i got a false ban.
