Very sorry. \n\nI am defiantly not amazing by ANY stretch of the imagination.

That said veterans of the game, especially those above gold should still have a bit more credit for their previous rank.","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"King Crow","date":"2016-12-08T12:47:29.990+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"i won 8/10 and landed on b3... i don't mind really, just means i gotta work harder to get back my ranking and surpass it.
