He had walked this path for years and years. The path lead through an endless stretch of tall, shadowing trees that towered over the small rocky path. He was approaching the temple as he heard the footsteps of another within. No one other than him had come this way for 15 years, ever since their master had been killed. Shen, anxious about who was inside the temple, drew his sword and inched closer towards the footsteps. He heard the sound of priceless items shattering on the floor, and the angered yelling of someone he knew very well. Zed&hellip;\r\n\r\nHe quickly dashed into the temple, catching Zed off guard, or so he thought. Zed&rsquo;s body was no more than a shadow by the time Shen threw his attack. &lsquo;What are you here for?!&rsquo; Shen yelled, hoping to pinpoint Zed&rsquo;s location from the direction of his voice. Despite Shen&rsquo;s efforts, Zed&rsquo;s voice echoed from every corner of the room. &lsquo;I&rsquo;m here for the last of the shadow&rsquo;s secrets, it will allow me to posses and transform hundreds of shadows at the same time.&rsquo;\r\nAnnoyed at his response, Shen swung his sword with such destructive force it tore through the brittle wood of the temple, revealing Zed, who had been hiding in the Master&rsquo;s private room. Shen leaped over the piles of rubble towards Zed. Dodging the attack, Zed ran into the forest, with Shen trailing close behind.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nZed and Shen had been fighting for 2 days straight. One strike after another, neither could penetrate the defense of the other. Tirelessly they continued, strike after strike, blow after blow, and neither was feeling any fatigue or any desire to surrender. They dodged in and out of each other&rsquo;s sight, attempting to catch the other off guard while they each looked hopelessly through the fog.\r\n\r\nThe vast forest was scattered with pine trees, shrouding anything other than that which lay close in front. The sunlight was completely absent, replaced with the stretched out surfaces of the leaves above. The ground modulated in height, turning into what seemed like valleys and mountains. Zed was decorated with blades: a seemingly infinite amount. His sandals, glowing blue, seemed to shroud itself in the fog, as if it didn&rsquo;t really exist. Shen was surrounded by an orange glow of heat, moving in a tidal motion, as if it were a tangerine sea.\r\n\r\n&lsquo;Is this really all you&rsquo;ve got?&rsquo; Zed whispered into Shen&rsquo;s back. For the hundredth time, Shen swung his sword viciously, ripping air apart in an attempt to deal the killing blow on his opponent. Zed cackled maniacally from a position far away from where he had previously been, almost as if he had teleported at the press of a button. &lsquo;You can&rsquo;t slash my shadows.&rsquo; he mentioned, with an undetectable hint of sarcasm. &lsquo;But I can dash them.&rsquo; Shen replied, with an equal amount of sarcasm.\r\n\r\nOn and on they fought, Zed&rsquo;s rapacious manner and Shen&rsquo;s unbreakable will to defend his culture kept them going for copious amounts of time.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n&lsquo;Well, well, what do we have here?&rsquo; A deep voice spoke over the clashing of blades, as if amused. Out stepped a dashingly handsome man, laden with giant pink gems flying above his shoulders and his sparkly chest bare. His boots were covered with pink fur, and he wore a headband, decorated with a small rose quartz. &lsquo;Whatever it is, I&rsquo;ll cleanse it with my gems!.&rsquo; Quickly, he rose his mace, summoning cosmic energy from the sky to protect the two ninjas from continuing any further in their quest to destroy each other. \r\n\r\n&lsquo;Taric. Leave.&rsquo; Zed ordered. Taric stood stock still, as if he hadn&rsquo;t heard a thing. He continued with his ultimate ability, with the prospect of turning both parties invincible and unable to fight.\r\n\r\nFrom the sky, a sudden pink light erupted from the skies, very similar to a falling feather, falling slowly to the ground towards Taric and the fighting pair. Glowing fluorescent lights in a circular shape appeared on the ground beneath them, their surroundings dazzling with bright pink and sparkles. \r\n\r\nThe light touched the ground and exploded, creating a glittery forcefield, cleansing all within and ridding them of hurtful thoughts. For the time being, anyway. Taric sighed, walking away from the fight, knowing what he had set out to do was done. &#039;Must I take care of brave and young fighters like these every single day? I must say though, these gems are truly outrageous, truly, truly outrageous. Now, where&rsquo;s the exit?&rsquo;\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nTYSM for reading!!  &lt;3","replies":[{"poster":"FranticFerret","date":"2016-07-10T06:02:01.165+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Outrageous.{{champion:44}} {{champion:44}} {{champion:44}} {{champion:44}} {{champion:44}} {{champion:44}} {{champion:44}} {{champion:44}} {{champion:44}} {{champion:44}} {{champion:44}} {{champion:44}} {{champion:44}}","replies":[]}]}
