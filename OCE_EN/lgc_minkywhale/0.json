To be honest I think coming second all the time realistically isn't as bad as the other places. I'm sure there are a lot of teams who would like to be second and play on stage. But that being said, from my perspective, coming second really does feel like losing only because we've done it so many times. We can't seem to progress and so it does feel like we may as well have come last. How other teams do it? I don't know honestly haha, I'd never really though about what they think.
