Especially when the enemy team drags the game out by another 5 minutes. \r\n\r\nObviously the nature of arams is that the roll decides the game 70% of the time. But in some of those extreme situations where one team can just play however they want it really stops being fun.","replies":[{"poster":"HORSE OF FORCE","date":"2015-02-12T04:50:51.056+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"http://boards.oce.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/player-creations\n\nThis ain't the right board to be posting something like this.","replies":[]}]}
