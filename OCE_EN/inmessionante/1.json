You can check my match history in OP.GG. My name &quot;Inmessionante&quot;\r\nAs you can see, after afk in a normal game as Tristana (It was a remake game), I played 5 aram game to take the leaverbuster, I&#039;ve just finished it.\r\nThe reply of my ticket was about how to fix the problem(the problem that made me stuck in the loading screen and disconnected and afk), not about cancel the leaverbuster or my behaviour.\r\nBut today when I want to login in and have a look about the Worlds mission, I just discovered that my account is suspended.\r\nNow I have some questions to ask.\r\n1. Is suspended same as banned? (Is it becasue you are doing some fixing on my account, or I got banned?\r\n2. When will it finish?\r\n3. What&#039;s the reason?\r\nI promise I didn&#039;t have any negative attitudes apart from afk, and I told you the reason, I didn&#039;t suppose to do that.\r\n\r\nI suppose to post the text above by support ticket, but it showed that my CAPTCHA failed, I don&#039;t know why that happened. So I post here.\r\n\r\nAND NOW I know it is a permanently banned.

Regarding the issue you've encountered with the captcha, you could try using alternate browsers (just tested it on my end, worked for me on Google Chrome and Firefox, but Internet Explorer doesn't seem to like the \"submit a request\" page). You should have received an email to the registered address regarding the ban, that might have some more info on why it's happened, so I'd recommend checking for that.\n\nGiven we're talking about a possible compromise, I'd also recommend you do a scan using some anti-virus software (Malwarebytes Antimalware is a good free option [in my experience], if you need it), just in case. Checking your match history for games you didn't play yourself could help identify if there was a compromise. If you find anything suspicious (particularly from an antivirus scan), it would probably be a good idea to go through and change some of your log-in details for things you've used recently (emails, online banking and such in particular).\n\nJust as a note regarding the LeaverBuster side of things, it's a policy that Riot will never remove Low Priority Queues. LeaverBuster typically doesn't result in suspensions, either. You can find more info regarding the LeaverBuster system in the LeaverBuster FAQ (Link: https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752714).","replies":[]}]}
