Started testing interactions with him and nunu&#039;s attackspeed slows in a custom with my mate. When we left, reconnect button appears, but the game didnt end. We clicked it, button went grey. Decided to close league and try to relog, and then we couldn&#039;t log in. It would just display the &quot;Logging in...&quot; window without any progression. Now it says im in a queue, position 1. and every 30 seconds or so, it adds 1 minute to the queue. Whats going on?","replies":[{"poster":"SephirothSG","date":"2016-02-02T05:49:44.717+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey there,\n\nThis is currently a known issue and is being looked into by Riot.\n\nSee the pinned thread in this forum for more info.","replies":[{"poster":"datredphoenix","date":"2016-02-02T05:51:57.503+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yeah, just refreshed the boards now.\nThanks.","replies":[{"poster":"SephirothSG","date":"2016-02-02T05:56:44.744+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"And we're live.\n\nSee you on the rift.","replies":[]}]}]}]}
