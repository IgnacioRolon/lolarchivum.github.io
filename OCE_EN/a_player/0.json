So first one at the end of a game that my team won i only gained 10 LP and this is the first time i ever only gained 10LP normally id gain 20LP and then the enemy team said in chat that they didnt lose any LP and in my head this really pissed me off how normally if id try my best and win a game id get 20 but i only got 10 and not only that also the fact that if i lost that game i would of lost nothing like whats the point of playing that game then. next issue is i had a veigar on my team that randomly complained about a lee on my team tilting him when lee didnt say anything in chat or do anything in game to affect his playing style but then veigar decided to troll by buying ad items we then lost the game and at the end i reported this veigar but once you report someone that person who you reported you dont want them to be in your games ever again right and riot should add a feature like that if u report a player then next couple of games you wont play with them however next game i was stuck with him again and yet he feed the mid laner and i lost because i had a player on my team twice in a row who fed soo much that i cant stop the enemy please riot fix this","replies":[{"poster":"Roguestoney","date":"2017-05-09T23:20:49.630+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"There were issues so loss prevented was enabled.
