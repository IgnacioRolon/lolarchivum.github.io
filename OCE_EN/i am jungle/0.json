Hopefully tomorrow!\n\nDefinitely gonna buy that Ekko skin it looks soooooo cool.","replies":[{"poster":"TwoHeadedFreak","date":"2016-07-29T02:02:06.349+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I got a virus at the perfect time (or so I thought).

Its frustrating when Riot takes forever to release shit to the live servers.
