It all went smoothly until we entered the actual game where the tutorial occurs and then nothing would work. My internet was fine my computer was fine just nothing was working I couldn&#039;t click on the shop to get the starting item (As the tutorial told) all that would happen is when I would hover my cursor over things it would give me a description, After around 10 minutes of sitting around the message that said I&#039;ve been disconnected for too long and the game will now exit. even though my ping was low and the game wasn&#039;t trying to reconnect. This has happened multiple times. I&#039;m not sure if it&#039;s the new client or just my computer.\r\n\r\nCheers.","replies":[{"poster":"SephirothSG","date":"2016-11-14T07:34:15.994+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey there,\n\nI just tested and am able to complete a tutorial game just fine.\n\nAre you still experiencing this issue?","replies":[{"poster":"TrexChompey","date":"2016-11-18T05:27:08.162+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It was really odd I think the game froze or something cause after around 1 hour of waiting I was able to continue and finish it","replies":[]}]}]}
