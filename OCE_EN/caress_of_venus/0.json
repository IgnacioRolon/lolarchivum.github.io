I have gone by many names during my time on OCE  servers and many know me by &#039;Caress of Venus&#039; (the name I used when I was most active).\r\n\r\nIts not a hidden fact for the last 3 seasons I was a bronze scrub, and I can say -now- that I&#039;ve finally gotten off Bronze&#039;s wild ride. \r\nThis morning I finished my promotion into Silver 5. It&#039;s not much, but its a start. \r\n\r\nI love this game, specifically Nami and Kindred -but whatever- and for a long time I just felt like the stigma of being bronze was getting me down. There were so many jokes about how terrible being a bronze player was. I looked at hundreds of videos on how the prop players and so on had climbed through the tiers to their rightful place but it always felt a little alienating to me, I was a player who doesn&#039;t follow the meta, which is probably why I&#039;ve spent such a long time in Bronze. \r\n\r\nSo I guess what I&#039;m trying to say is, that the relief of finally meeting the expectations of those who had supported me while I was in bronze, saying really encouraging things like: &quot;your supporting is definitely not Bronze Level,&quot; or &quot;wow [Champion] how are you bronze&quot; really encouraged me to do my best to prove that I could break free of the chains that bronze has so tightly wrapped around me.\r\n\r\nA lot of the old GDers spent a good deal of time playing games with me, giving me tips (and me being an ass to them telling me I was wrong, sorry) and generally encouraging me, and I&#039;m really thankful for it.\r\n\r\nSo this post is really just a thank you to them, because preseason 2016 has been the ideal time for me to be playing ranked. The meta suits the way I love to play, and I&#039;ve managed to pull a lot of my wins on two of my old favourite champions - Miss Fortune and Sona -\r\n\r\nSorry about this boring as post, I just needed to get this off my chest I guess. Thanks everyone!\r\n\r\n{{champion:267}}","replies":[]}
