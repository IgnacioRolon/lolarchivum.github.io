Every time i try to pick someone i don&#039;t have a page for i either get kicked because im building runes/masteries while needing to lock it in because there is no noticeable sound que for when im going to need to do it or im running out of time to setup the runes and masteries because im in last pick or just taking a while to decide and end up losing the game because i only have half a mastery page or the wrong page and runes. \r\n\r\nsome solutions would be can we get dragged out of the mastery page or have it open in a second window AND get a noticeable sound que Or can keep the lock it in button visible inside mastery selection for when we need to click it or be allowed to lock in earlier perhaps without showing what champ we have locked in to the enemy until later.\r\n\r\nBig unorganized sentences because im frustrated with my 30 minute que dodge timer that isn&#039;t entirely my fault and happens to a lot of people and could be fixed within like half an hour and added to a regular patch.","replies":[{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2017-09-03T03:05:17.068+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Set up masteries beforehand. Even if you can't get too specific, if you set up pages such that you only have to change one or two masteries in a page in select, then you won't have any problems. Select isn't designed for you to be able to make whole new pages, but you are given the chance to edit them so you can tailor your more general pages to a specific matchup.","replies":[{"poster":"REX PIMPWAGEN","date":"2017-09-03T06:19:00.149+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Setting up masteries for your favorite and common picks is what everyone does im talking about when you want to play a champion you don't normally play or when you need to adjust masteries or switch champion near the end of que if you get countered or want to counter someone. There is not enough time and the warning you get is barely audible over the games music plus it keeps you in the mastery selection and you cant hit lock in while its up. It is designed so you can do that or at least it was designed so you could do that. Going into a game and forcing a pick onto yourself like that is stupid and a terrible idea especially for solo que where champion choice can win games by themselves.\n\nQue dodges are actually WAY more common than they were before and im pretty sure its because people are timing out due to this lock in feature and i wouldn't be surprised if most of those cases they were in their mastery page selection screen.","replies":[{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2017-09-04T01:31:27.737+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Which is why I say create generalised pages. You'd presumably have more specific ones for the champions you play often. I mean set up general ones for the champions you don't. If you have a basic mastery page for the type of champion you are going to play, then you'll only have to change a few mastery points in select which takes about 5 seconds. If you don't have a page you can quickly tailor to x champion you might play to counter then make one.\n\nBeing prepared is a free advantage to you over anyone who isn't, and it doesn't take long, so if you're going to be playing ranked there's no reason not to. Better to have a page and not need it, than to not have it and have to try and make the whole thing in 10~ seconds.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"iLLz","date":"2017-09-05T02:54:18.347+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"make the following pages \nap \nad\nsup\ntank \njg \njg2 \nyoull be all good no matter who you pick","replies":[]}]}
