This would let you spam it and burn through mana really fast to have full use of attack speed items just for fun or just help out in clutch fights where you have to choose between death before your auto completes and hitting q but end up canceling the auto meaning the other guy gets to finish his next auto first as well. Its not really a meaningful buff just an extra option that has niece chances to win you an extra fight every now and again if you make the correct choice with it or a buff to his more for fun type builds.\r\n\r\nAre there any weird interactions I might be missing here that would make this broken?","replies":[]}
