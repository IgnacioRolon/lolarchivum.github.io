For me it&#039;s {{champion:75}} W (Wither) and/or {{champion:23}}  W (Mocking Shout) because they both act very similar. Now you might be asking me why only slowing abilities? Why not something like {{champion:13}} W (Rune Prison) where it actually stops you from doing anything, and to that I&#039;ll ask you again: What is the SCARIEST ability a champion could have? Not, what is the most bullshit ability a champion could have (cause this post isn&#039;t a rant). Still don&#039;t get it? Imagine running from one of these two and they slow you (and if you&#039;re well aware these slows are BIG), as you try to run away they come closer and closer and when they finally get in range... BAM! Your health is gone. Through that whole process you do your very best trying to kite as much as possible only for it to be nothing as they 100-0 you and your mind breaks slowly. At least with {{champion:13}} you&#039;re mentally prepared you are going to die, but with these two? They are basically toying with your emotions and it&#039;s just dirty and wrong. So again, what ability/abilities do you guys find terrifying?","replies":[{"poster":"Maraudaur","date":"2016-12-13T11:27:22.338+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":0,"body":"One that always gets me is Nocturne ult =D \"DARRRKKNNEESSSSS\"","replies":[{"poster":"Mozzie25","date":"2017-05-30T08:55:49.744+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Second this.
