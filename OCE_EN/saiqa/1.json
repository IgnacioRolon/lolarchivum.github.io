I ask my team if I can lane swap but no luck. My team asks for a tanky jungler so I pick Hecarim because he&#039;s pretty busted. We lost that game because they had a fed Yasuo and I was flamed for many reasons alongside a Top Singed. One of the main reasons I was flamed was because I was building Trinity Force on Hecarim, my teammates accused me of trolling for building it because I was negative with a KDA of 5/7/6. I would understand if they flamed me because I was negative but that didn&#039;t even matter to them. They were so upset of me for building the item over my overall performance. This wasn&#039;t just one person, it was everyone except the Singed accusing me of trolling. Other reasons they flamed me was because I banned Poppy over Yasuo and I couldn&#039;t &#039;jungle&#039; (no shit, Sherlocks). Can someone tell me if building Trinity Force is bannable because I was negative?","replies":[]}
