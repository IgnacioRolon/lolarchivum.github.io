Of course, I thought I might just be having internet issues and such but it seems almost every game I go in someone else has it worst with 500-1000 (or even more) ping. I might just be stupid and this is probably something that ALWAYS happens but for me it started when patch 6.24 hit. Any thoughts?","replies":[{"poster":"SephirothSG","date":"2016-12-11T01:21:10.106+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey there,\n\nCould you do the following for me;\n\n* [Download WinMTR](https://sourceforge.net/projects/winmtr/files/WinMTR-v092.zip/download) and run a traceroute to the following IP.

I can't, but I definitely posted it.\n**Edit 2:** Is it okay if I just copy and paste the results?
