I just started playing yesterday and had no clue what it was until like 3 minutes ago, does anyone know how to get unbanned I wasn't doing it on purpose, I just suck at the game!","replies":[{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2019-03-10T11:34:33.972+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Intentional Feeding bans are usually pretty conservative. The system takes more steps before punishing for intent feeding precisely to prevent people from being punished just for bad games. That's not to say false punishments don't happen, though.\n\nIf you weren't intentionally feeding, and that was the only reason given for the ban, then your best bet is to submit a ticket to player support detailing your situation. If it's a false positive then player support can reverse the punishment.\n\nhttps://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/requests/new","replies":[]},{"poster":"Judgementhascome","date":"2019-03-10T08:49:42.710+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Sorry buddy but there isn't a way to get unbanned. Intentionally feeding is pretty much just intentionally dieing to the enemy team because you just don't care for the game anymore. Just create a new account and start forward. I looked at your match history and you went 0-27. Honestly in all 9 years in playing this game, I never really saw that many deaths when a person is actually trying. Might be wrong but it does seem like you were inting. ","replies":[]}]}
