I finally managed to crack silver but after that I was just losing having bad games and throwing a-lot. \r\nProblem being now its 2016 and apart from watching worlds and following the LCS and LCK i haven&#039;t had much hands on with league. So booting it up now i&#039;m looking at champs and the new and wonderful stuff, and i feel like i did when i started back in 2012 ahaha i&#039;m so lost so out of interest. \r\n\r\nWhats the current meta main champions being used for each role and is Ezreal a viable pick for ADC, also the team comps are still TOP, JUN, MID, ADC, SUP\r\n\r\nIf anyone can point me in the right direction I&#039;d appreciate it, it&#039;s about time i re-entered the rift and try hit Gold this year :D\r\n\r\nThanks all","replies":[{"poster":"SpawnTheCaster","date":"2016-01-12T00:58:07.519+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey AnimeSFan\nAnswer your question on Ez first, I think hes pretty good at the moment. I build him blue build (manamune, IceBorn Gauntlet, Merc Scimitar) bottom lane and trinity essence reaver mid. \n\nAs for what the meta is, generally still the same as worlds with the exception that GP and Morde got hit, and you will see Quinn Ez and graves jungle from time to time.\n\nBans are generally Trundle (tank shred), Mundo (great jungler), Soraka and Tahm, with what ever else you dont wanna play thrown in there. #banrengar!\n\nIf you have any other questions let me know.\n\nCheers, Spawn","replies":[{"poster":"Bambooze","date":"2016-01-13T04:00:23.907+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I don't like people who #banrengar\n\nI tend to find those people\n\nwherever they are\n\nand do stuff to them\n\nnot nice stuff\n\nnot nice at all.....","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"AnimeSFan1","date":"2016-01-12T01:12:57.333+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thanks heaps ill go over everything and hopefully be able to ease back into League ^_^ feel more confident now.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Tele","date":"2016-01-12T00:59:40.388+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Not much has changed really. I'll go over the basics.\n\n+ **Top: **\n Teleport is still a must to be honest, but you might be able to get away with ignite if you get ahead and take Rift Herald. \n \n You're going to see super tanks like Dr. Mundo with Grasp of the Undying mastery, it's super annoying to deal with.\n\n Sion is a beast BTW, try him out!\n\n\n+ **Jungle:**\n Remember Feral Flare? Well we have something called devourer now. It gives you double on hits, every second hit. Basically Master Yi and Jax love this item and build it all the time with Guinsoo's Rageblade. \n\n But apart from them the jungle is very early game heavy, Lee Sin is a top pick again. You can still play tanks well though, due to how important teamfghting is. \n\n Oh, and Nidalee is a jungler now.\n\n\n+ **Mid: **\nKassadin is long gone from the meta. Silences are soon becoming a thing of the past. AD assassins seem to be the top picks there, but AP are great as well. Just anything that you can snowball early on. \n\n Oh, and people are taking Teleport mid lane sometimes. ROA is broken as well IMO.\n\n\n+ ADC: There's literally too much to go over for this one. We had a massive rework to everyone. I suggest you read through [patch 5.22](http://oce.leagueoflegends.com/en/news/game-updates/patch/patch-522-notes) where everything changed.\n\n Oh and Mordekaiser is an ADC now. He can possess and control Dragon as well.\n\n\n+ Support:\n Honestly about the same. Blitzcrank still OP. \n\nNow for general stuff. \n\n1. Take the new blue trinket when you can.\n\n2. Green Wards don't exist anymore. Buy pinks. If you want Green Wards get Sightstone or use a trinket.\n\n3. Rift Herald > Dragon.\n\n4. Towers = butter. If you get aced expect 2 - 3 turrets gone early game.\n\n5. Take the Thunderlord's mastery on everyone unless you're going Grasp of the Undying. This will change next patch though.\n\nI probably missed a lot, but that should be enough.

Play loads of normal's, experiment and pay attention to what everyone else is playing. There has been a huge about of changes since you have been gone and an especially big one being the pre-season changes. Most people are still not used to these changes yet and they are still imo incomplete. they will be tidied up in the next week or so when the new 6.1 patch hits so make sure you read up on the patch notes when they become available. \n\nAs for Ezreal adc; I firmly believe he is still viable. He has a flexible build path and with the new mastery changes the 45% CDR cap rather than the old 40% is a wonderful thing on Ez. \n\nAs for the new mastery's practically the only one worth running at this time is thunderlords. This is the strongest at this time and more often than not everyone in every game is running it. I do prefer grasp of the undying on someone like Shen top but that's just me.\n\nHope any or all of that was helpful =)","replies":[]}]}
