I am glad OCE finally has normal draft pick for practising. I am comfortable macro shot calling for teams and is how I win games even when my mechanical skill is off for the day, I am lacking in my team-fight shot calling however and it is something I would love to learn. I am a jack-of-all trades player but my most comprehensive experience on a single champion is Irelia (600ish games across multiple accounts over 4 years) and Riven (300ish games across multiple accounts over 4 years) which I spent many many 100&#039;s of games learning then piloted a alt account in season 6 to gold 1 maining those two champions. I am most comfortable in top lane however in solo queue I have found brand support is my most reliable champion for carrying games.\r\n\r\nI currently reside in silver 4 but have made little to no effort to climb this season so far. I was placed bronze 3 and through the games I have played comfortable climbed out while teaching new players. I can swiftly pick up new champions and perform on them allowing me to enhance the strength of other more specialist players on a team or craft win conditions in team comps.\r\n\r\nI do not have any role preferences and have played everything but mid lane comfortably at high silver / low gold.\r\n\r\nI have experience playing in teams before and this has taught me to be Kind and forward thinking in game and constructive and critical post game. I am also happy to review matches played in my own time to help give constructive feedback so we can all improve together. I have played with diamond and master tier players and bronze players alike and I am willing to put in effort to improve mechanics if that is what is necessary however I prefer to alter my play-style to be able to work around our strongest and most reliable players. Be it picking up a champion to shove and assist for invades to assist the jungler or playing a support that can set up an ADC for success or even playing nunu to guarantee map control.\r\n\r\nI enjoy support, jungle and top lane the most but would be happy to pickup ADC once more for a fun team (see my kogmaw winrate last season that got me temporarily banned because they thought I was scripting &gt;_&gt;)\r\n\r\nI have sport commitments on monday evenings and Tabletop RPG commitments on some other evenings but I am happy to move my schedule around for a good group of people that enjoy the game :). I live in SA.","replies":[]}
