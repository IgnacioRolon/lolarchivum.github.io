Idea for Teamname\n2. What attitude you bring to a team\n3. Your general availability\n4. What is your favourite play style or team comp\n5. Your best league related pun/joke/meme\n~NOTE: Champ pools and roles least important its about making a team or community that can improve together\n\nIf there are a lot of people (there are from what I see on the boards) maybe we can start an OCE low-elo community so we can get some good games with people who want to improve and have fun while doing so.\n\nSudsyMcGee","replies":[{"poster":"Gragozz","date":"2018-03-20T10:37:33.960+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"This sounds fun aha \n\n1.

Team name could be decided when the team is formed/ everyone has gotten together.\n2. My attitude could be best described as keen, and flexible as to who I am dealing with.\n3. Available at pretty much all times of the day.\n4. My play style is split between support mage roles, either mid or support. I can play all roles to a pretty decent level. My favorite comp up to date is the classic two mage support players mid and support, peeling an adc with an engage tank top and jg.\n5. My best meme to say would be that I used to be a Yasuo main until I got an arrow of shame to the knee one day.","replies":[{"poster":"SudsyMcGee","date":"2018-03-21T06:24:12.578+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey\n\nSounds great join up to the discord when you get a chance we are just chatting in general.

Im sure most of us will be older but as long as you are focused on improving i'm sure people wont mind the high pitch voice ha ha.

No idea, maybe we can pool some names and pull 3 from a \"hat\" see what we get.\n2. Very chill, i dont rage or get toxic dont see a point to, I do however get a little loud and excitable during 5man fights and ganks\n3. Mostly late nights, after 1am onwards. (unless got an RDO)\n4.
