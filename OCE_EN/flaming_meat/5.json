I have sent in a ticket and had an automated response sent back (I have replied politely asking for them to look into it). However I would like to echo my points in the ticket here incase I get lucky and a gallant knight peeps into the thread to save my account:\r\n\r\nI theorize that I have been reported due to myself ranking up the account in flex queue, I am an Illaoi one trick and wanted to bring the account up to Master where my other one sits due to the fact that this account was in Silver for a majority of Season 5-6 to mess around in ranked with friends, however they are still bronze and so I could not ranked with them on this account. I have never touched anything that could remotely impact League of Legends. Like, never used curse voice overlay, no op.gg add-on&#039;s, nothing. If there is anything I can supply as evidence I will gladly do so. Attached is a list of all of my installed programs, let me know if any false flag.\r\n\r\nAnd thus I attached my list of installed programs. The ones that stand out to me and have been echoed through other threads are razor synapse, curse voice, and cheat engine. Possibly my Japanese language doo dad but that is from Microsoft.\r\n\r\nBut yeh I had the account since season 2, no restrictions, no suspensions, nothing; the same for my others; it was the first account I made and held a lot of memories and $$$. I play my other accounts on the same computer but 100% they don&#039;t get reported as much, I&#039;m currently ranking up https://oce.op.gg/summoner/userName=MSK+Meat from what was bronze I, so I&#039;ll keep the thread up to date with the status of that one.","replies":[{"poster":"Flaming Meat","date":"2017-05-13T02:19:38.838+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Greetings Summoner:\n\nAccount: flamingmeat\n\nWe are writing to let you know that we’ve done some additional case review, and your account was incorrectly identified as having violated the League of Legends’ Terms of Use.

Ticket No. #30244883 . But in all honesty I'm just peeved that something like this could happen. Not too big of a road block but really damaging to my moral and image of League. I mean, that's a metric assload of time spent on the account and has a bunch of memories and old friends attached.","replies":[{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2017-05-12T15:59:50.501+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I responded on your other post, but just replying here so I don't double up :) Just let me know what happens with the ticket and if there is trouble I can help you further.","replies":[{"poster":"Flaming Meat","date":"2017-05-12T16:03:01.353+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Get some sleep m'dude and let me know if there's an easy way to contact you lol\n\nI'm gonna head off till tomorrow so I guess I'll see what happens.","replies":[]}]}]}]}
