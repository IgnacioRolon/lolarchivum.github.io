So, for example, we look at Annie mid differently to Annie support.

My score warrants an A rank apparently. So, if I include the object assists, which was the 2 bottom turrets and one mid, and the 2 dragons. That's half of the map's objectives in turrets (of the destroyed ones I participated in 6/10, Graves would have been in the mid lane 3, he was dead for the final push of the last 2, didn't touch inhibitors and was present for the first dragon, not the second), 2 inhibitors which never re-spawned, and both dragons taken. Ward placement was as soon as it was off CD after level 9 as you can see, you hold yellow trinket most of the time to stop people resetting creep aggro in lane. CS was the only thing lacking and was due to rotating and taking said objectives from the kill lead like any good player would.\n\nIf we were to follow this reasoning than every S ranked Draven would have over 20kda, taken every tower on the map, bought a sightstone, and not missed one creep in lane. I believe the system should be based on individual performance, and even in this case it is soooooo hard to believe that this is a slightly above average game for a Draven.","replies":[{"poster":"Shana Rei","date":"2016-05-02T22:56:07.376+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It is kinda of annoying but only if you play champs where they are \"supposed\" to be played.
