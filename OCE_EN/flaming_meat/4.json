However I lost a lot more than access to my account that day; my university team kicked me as they didn&#039;t want to take any risks, my reddit account blasted, but most of all my credibility as a player or a coach was destroyed.\r\n\r\nI emailed support if they could provide a statement for me to, like, show people IRL that my account was false flagged. They&#039;re not allowed to speak on the system&#039;s behalf.\r\n\r\nOk.\r\n\r\nHow about me not walking away empty-handed? Some gift card or RP would be almost equivalent to the empty apology of making a bread basket; atleast I would have something from the ordeal:\r\n\r\n&#039;Unfortunately, we are not providing compensation for this incident&#039;\r\n\r\n... Nice.","replies":[{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2017-05-14T04:41:49.209+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"It's one of those things they just don't do, but as far as your credibility is concerned, would it not be enough to show them your correspondence with support?
