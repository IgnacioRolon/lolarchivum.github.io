However I don&#039;t get why a permanent? I mean I paid a fair amount of money to riot for skins, champs, RP etc, only to have them revoked.\r\n\r\nI Did have a 2-Week suspension about a two months ago, and have only ever had a 20 minute timer for 5 games once during that time and now. Now during the last two matches i was a little bit toxic yes, which is why i agree with the suspension. But i DID try to stop myself by muting my team. Only to unmute and apologize for my toxicity. \r\n\r\nHere are the chat logs.\r\n\r\n&quot;Game 1 \r\nVerinity: great \r\nVerinity: just great \r\nVerinity: ur support \r\nVerinity: im the adc \r\nVerinity: u dont get kills \r\nVerinity: gg \r\nVerinity: fuking stupid support arfnt ya \r\nVerinity: lol \r\nVerinity: least i was doing something \r\nVerinity: u stood in bush doing nothing \r\nVerinity: at all \r\nVerinity: useless \r\nVerinity: useless \r\nVerinity: ggwp \r\nVerinity: report amummu \r\nVerinity: lol, you chose amummu support \r\nVerinity: he cannot support \r\nVerinity: plus he stands there doing nothing \r\nVerinity: fuk sake u stupid support \r\nVerinity: &#039; \r\nVerinity: why the fuk do you focus their support?
