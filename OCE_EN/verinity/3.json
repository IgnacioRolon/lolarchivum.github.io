Yasuo is designed for 1v1 fights, he wins those easily, he loses to multiple enemies easily. That penta kill was killing them off from the allies and splitting up the ones he killed himself, Garen went in low hp and didnt even bother to get a hit on the yasuo. the leo was stolen from teemo(good job), the kha and rammus went in together, with a rammus as well easy kill, but rammus instead of taunting froze and left draven alone after yasuo's dash, which made it a 1v1, the after kha died he still didnt do anything(what a useless team member), too late by then, the yasuo dashed past him and one again left it as a 1v1, where yasuo was left to kill rammus, yasuo decided he would come in and take pressure from 2 and die to the yasuo (who was already fed). Then garen was too low to do anything because he decided to fight low instead heal.\n\nAs was seen he managed to peel every enemy away from him and keep the fights at a 1v1 to kill them. Also the lux qwer helped, and a fed anything is strong.  He was fed before the fight, he was lv 17, their average was 13. Also is any of them hit a single form or cc at all yasuo woulda likely died, draven didnt press e, rammus didnt press e, leo pressed nothing because she was screwing around with a lux, garen didnt get a silence and yasuo didnt play it and stack a tornado, he just ran in from well and died.\n\nWas also a lucky game, considering they have a 32% performance rate, and their win rate for him in ranked (where skill relly matters) is also 32%... In bronze... Says a damn lot.","replies":[{"poster":"PuncakesssR","date":"2016-10-28T23:28:10.470+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Well it is a bronze game but hey atleast he's not going 0/15 right","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"PuncakesssR","date":"2016-10-28T23:26:23.969+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Good job man!","replies":[]},{"poster":"Talon12","date":"2016-10-28T22:03:12.837+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":">Not all yasuo's are bad!\n\nI know they are not.
