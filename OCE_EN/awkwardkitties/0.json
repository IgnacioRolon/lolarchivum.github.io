What was meant to be a s1/g4 game turned into a slaughter with no chance of winning for my team (stole drags a couple times but the enemy jg didnt really stand a chance). Other factors of course played a roll such as my top and mid being a yas and riven who need more practise on those champs but that's not the point. The point is that my account is around 2-3 years old and somehow I'm getting matched with brand new, not placed yet players. This is stupid imo. They should take into count the age of a lol account when matching players together. This would put players of equal skill together as the actual ranked placement isn't the best indicator of skill.","replies":[{"poster":"Sesilan","date":"2019-08-26T22:32:38.826+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The reason you get against those players is due to the mmr system, IIRC the base mmr for all accounts is Silver, 1250, you play your 10 games to go up or down and see where you're landing, just because you're playing with a fresh level 30 doesn't mean he doesn't have the skill required to play with you, he may have just had a bad game or been against someone who just happens to outclass him, 1250 mmr is the base level for silver, Silver 4 these days, meaning if he was able to get into your Silver 1/G4 games, it means either someone on the enemy team is also fairly close to that 1250 mark or he's happened to gain enough mmr to be around the S1/G4 bracket, in which case, he deserved to be in that game.\n\nTime played really doesn't factor for anything, I've played this game since Beta and I am a hot pile of rubbish at this game these days. (I do happen to have some very nice aged skins though {{champion:4}} )","replies":[{"poster":"ThatsBS","date":"2019-08-30T08:23:55.287+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I dont agree, if a new guy comes in. They only need a luck of placements to be in the elo of s1. They may (probably won't) have the actual skill be at the elo in the game. Yes 1250 elo is the base for s4, but you dont even need to win most or all of your placment games to get there. So do we need more placment games for new summoners for the first time entering ranked? Should it be 50? \n\nThat may make it more accurate.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Orange Caramel","date":"2019-08-22T02:06:26.535+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"There are kids with 1m mastery points who are hardstuck in bronze.\nTime means nothing.","replies":[]},{"poster":"ThatsBS","date":"2019-08-18T04:03:04.664+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"My account has been around since the beta.... Trust me you wouldn't want me on your team. So I'm the reason why you're opinion may be flawed..  I'm what you would get over a new level 30 player. I.e the most likely alternative would be my account being pushed up instead of a new lvl 30. They (The new lvl 30 acc) most likely would be naturally better, but still be able to learn. Where as im such an old dog...

You would be placing people switching to League after 5 years of DotA or have played League since beta but have made a new account with people who have never played a MOBA or RTS before in their life, at which point you have a phenomenal skill disparity, that hurts every single player in that separate queue (assuming the population of OCE is even big enough to support such a thing).","replies":[{"poster":"ThatsBS","date":"2019-08-26T20:26:05.132+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"That sounds better than what is currently happening.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]}
