When creating new runes if you haven&#039;t saved the page and the game starts your page is closed and you are presented with a pop up that asks if you wish to save your changes. Obviously you would click yes, thank rito for having your back and making sure you don&#039;t take fleet on a mage. Except this button doesn&#039;t work. When making any changes to a page and you fail to click save you are stuck with what was on that page from the last time you clicked save. The popup doesn&#039;t save your runes when it should. Now you may say it&#039;s my fault for not looking at the timer and I rebut that by saying if I was last pick and I wanted zed, I would have a rune page set up for him. Then the previous pick picked zed. Now I have to select a new champ and get new runes for them. All this is less than one minute. So in 60 seconds it is unfair to make players find a new champion, lock in, select new summoner spells and finish a rune page all within the time limit or else tough luck you lose the next 20 mins getting slammed because you don&#039;t have proper runes. Welcome to season 9 summoners where shit still ain&#039;t fixed.{{sticker:zombie-brand-facepalm}}","replies":[{"poster":"slxw","date":"2018-12-06T04:28:31.591+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"these options are legit","replies":[]}]}
