So now that I can keep up in items with the fed enemy I have just as high a bounty and that&#039;s supposed to be fair? How is it a &#039;comeback&#039; for the enemy because I spent laning phase actually last hitting and not kill trading but as soon as the first team fight breaks out I have to worry about feeding more gold to the enemy? Bounties based off cs is incredibly stupid when someone has no kills and only cs&#039;d well for 10 mins. Bounties should increase based on cs AFTER they stacked up some kills. It&#039;s not fair to get 4 man dove top and feed 500g to the enemy because you&#039;re not as boosted as the other 9 apes in game.","replies":[{"poster":"Leylin Farlier","date":"2019-01-09T12:34:44.331+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"You might be missing the point here friend. Bounties are made to give the chance of comebacks, that you are right. But to have this comeback one side must first have an advantage. Advantage is identified as someone having more gold than the rest. If you farmed perfectly then that meant you have obtained a lot of gold with relatively low risk. The only risk being that you have \"apes\" for a team. Your method of obtaining gold or advantage is just different from the other team. They have to make plays or take risks to get ahead and push your team behind, while on the other hand you farmed. While farming doesn't push your enemies behind you do it so with relative safety as compared to what your enemies did - they took a gamble and it paid off. Remeber, ranks are there to put players of equal skill, although we know thats not true 50% or more of the time >_>.\n\nImagine this, if someone can farm to get ahead because they had a favourable match up, this player can pretty much strangle the enemy laner and deny them gold (gold = more items = more DMG - ofc you knw this). According to you the only way for them to make a comeback is through the bounty system which is implemented by the enemy having lots of kill. If the bounty system worked on a KDA system, then the game becomes a farming simulator. Why, you ask? Because taking risks wouldn't make sense. If I was the dominant lane and have full control of lane, I can just freeze the lane then shove. I take cs advantage and item advantage, by the time I itemize, there would be no-way for you to make a play on me and come out on top. If you did try to make a play, I can just shit on you since I'm the dominant one. I'll make a scenario where your jg would have to babysit you just to cs, this will open up opportunity for the rest of my team. Where's the comeback in that for the losing team? They can't get bounty since according to you, bounty should be implemented on a kda system and not gold advantage through farm.\n\nThis is why pros say \"cs is king\" a lot. But I'm just low elo though, so I dunno.","replies":[]}]}
