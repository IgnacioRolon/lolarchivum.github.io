I am genuinely curious as to how they do and am hoping to get some insight into how you go about balancing different champions over different scenarios.\n\nI know balancing this sort of game with its extreme diversity must be a daunting task so how do you do it? I am imagining something along the lines of analysis of data, change of some numbers and then playtesting across multiple senarios. So how do slip ups like the recent Galio buffs male it though all your contingencies and the pbe? \n\nAre there other processes on how you decide what gets needed or buff aside from straight analytics? How do you decide what numbers to fiddle with?\n","replies":[{"poster":"BarryButcher","date":"2017-11-11T10:58:24.492+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ii_Q4OCoHvU","replies":[]},{"poster":"JasonWazza","date":"2017-11-12T05:13:31.566+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"Because PBE isn't for testing the balance, it's for \"bug testing\" even though a decent amount of bugs still make it to live, they manage to iron out a lot of the major ones.\n\nAnd the balancing team is a bunch of people who don't understand the game or balancing, as was proven by what they said about Galio in that he was expected to build some AP and some tank, they show a massive misunderstanding in what happens in league of legends.\n\nNot only that, but a calculator could have told you that the ratios were going to be really high and abused, but Rito is too poor to give their balancing team calculators.","replies":[]}]}
