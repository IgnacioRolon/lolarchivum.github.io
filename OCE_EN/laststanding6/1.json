Not the range, just the fact it can pop on-hit effects like lich bane make it so it is an upgraded fizz q. Soooo much damage as well as an instant teleport. I think if you remove his ability to proc on hit effects like the lich bane on the e, it would make him balanced.","replies":[{"poster":"JasonWazza","date":"2015-05-31T05:46:18.009+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":0,"body":"A) it's an auto.\nB) the E is fine, taking off on hit effects is a stupid and extremely unnecessary nerf, and honestly, would probably just change the build instead of the champion.","replies":[{"poster":"Olee","date":"2015-05-31T06:48:07.531+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Give this man a medal","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Alamo","date":"2015-06-18T00:01:17.886+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"lol, reminds me of a couple of days ago, this ekko just escaped my irelia combo with his flash, he proceeds to ult back to his previous place so I can combo him, how convenient!!","replies":[]},{"poster":"Olee","date":"2015-05-31T06:48:32.858+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"He just ridiculous ratios, patience.","replies":[{"poster":"Excited","date":"2015-05-31T09:12:44.598+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"He is high risk high reward.\n\n","replies":[{"poster":"Robin Song Robin","date":"2015-06-17T10:13:56.028+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> \"High Risk, High Reward\"\n\nAoE Slow on Q for insane kiting/chase\nAoE Slow/Stun on W for insane kiting/chase WITH a 0.8AP scaling shield\nA dash AND blink on his E for insane kiting/chase\nInstant blink and self-heal ultimate so if he happens to get caught out he can just press R and walk away.\n\nWhere is the risk???","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Lauricella3","date":"2015-06-01T03:54:17.147+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"his e's fine it's the rest of the kit thats unbalanced/ his\n passives's 3 second 80% slow for one","replies":[]},{"poster":"sparklefart","date":"2015-06-01T01:38:27.768+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Take on hit effects off an auto attack...\n..\n..\n..\nUMAD?","replies":[]},{"poster":"ShuffledPancake","date":"2015-05-31T06:21:33.785+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"OR they could remove the dash xD bcz you know Vel koz was the perfect champ and he has no dash (lel)","replies":[]}]}
