One feature that isn't being immediately brought over from the legacy client are item sets. However, your existing item sets will still continue to work and our third-party API will sitll allow you to download custom item sets from community developers for in-game use.\n\nHere's a list of things which will be missing at the start of open beta (but which we'll work quickly to add):\n\nAccount transfers\nSummoner name changes\nEnd-of-game gifting\nBattle boosts in ARAM\nSpectate friends (and spectating custom games)\nSearching for and joining open custom games\nWard skins in your Collection","replies":[{"poster":"RebirthKnight","date":"2016-11-11T03:13:11.035+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"First off, thank you and well done to you and the team for what you have all accomplished so far.\n\nFrom what I remember there was an article published a while back, maybe 3 weeks or more saying that Item Sets will be removed for the Alpha and onwards because of a minority of people using them. Would you happen to know where that article is, because I would like to share it around for those who keep asking about it. It is a shame not many people read the devblogs.\n\nAgain, thanks for everything\n\n-RK. \n\n{{sticker:slayer-pantheon-thumbs}}","replies":[{"poster":"Maraudaur","date":"2016-11-11T03:19:21.450+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"Never popular when we dont implement something, but it usually comes down to priorities and resource constraints. \n\nHere's a link to a relevant thread - http://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/alpha-client-discussion/xYiHismR?comment=0001","replies":[]}]}]}]}
