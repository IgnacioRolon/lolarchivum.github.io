It's pretty well thought out, and as last years worlds and msi showed us the wildcard winner often struggles against the more established regions. Not sure how the wild card runners up would go but I'm not sure it would be pretty. \n\nWe are seeing an improvement in the wildcard teams, as the regions progress and gain talent. Eventually I'm sure riot will give the regions who have grown to be competitive a permanent spot.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Wolves","date":"2016-04-10T07:01:27.247+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"If you qualify for worlds you get a minimum of 25,000 as a price pool money for participation. I dont think every region should get a spot since if you are good enough as a region you will qualify regardless even in saying that , a well performing wildcard team can be considered to get 3 spots to worlds for its region if and only you make it to the finals announcing that you are a dominant region and potential contender for worlds tittle. SO riot will invest money into that region for it to develop further talent like that.\n\nIf that doesnt happen there is no need to invest money into a (yes I said it ) lesser region.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Eimer Troll","date":"2016-04-05T23:20:21.335+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Even if new teams come to a new region where are you going to find the players for the teams? Will you dilute the already small pool of players that some of these regions already have? Or will you import players even then how will you know that the organisation will be successful and have any longevity in the area?\n\nWorlds this year will once again be won by somebody from the LCK, NA vs EU rivalry will be on full display but just a sideshow attraction to the main event, China will be interesting to see how they progress through rest of year to worlds as they had an average showing at the recent international event. And wildcard teams could possibly cause an upset like they did a couple of years ago but will more than likely just get stomped. \n\nFor the wildcard regions to grow and be more competitive they need to have the infrastructure to support them, not just the shot at a free ride to worlds","replies":[{"poster":"The Mark Show","date":"2016-04-06T11:17:47.546+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"In order to have the infrastructure to support them the opportunity at a worlds ticket creates this by bringing in bigger, richer teams from the dominate regions to compete in these smaller regions improving the infrastructure, and its not a free ride to worlds, its the same ride that the bigger regions get, its fairer","replies":[]}]}]}
