Account sharing or B. straight up boosting by using the account directly or DUO boosting.\nthe other reason I feel players who are higher come to bronze is simply to have a \"relaxing game\"\n\nWhat does bronze offer higher players?\n\nbasically a draft pick with no repercussions if they win or lose.\nstress-free due to our atmosphere, No toxic yelling or whatever. you aren't called out on your shit.\nEGO issues.\nalso\nTo me, it feels like the ladder gets compressed sometimes...\n\nchallenger goes into diamond. so diamond goes into plat, plat goes into gold.. etc. etc...\nthis could be due to server size but if it is, I question the amount of boosting further.. is most of the high end of the ladder just show pony accounts rarely played?\n\nWhy isn't this looked into..?\n\nTo those saying but but.. smurfs don't harm anything. or playing a high ranked player is fine... No, it isn't.\n\nit's like asking a 5yr old white belt in karate to vs a fully grown black-belt in his/her prime... it's not going to end well and we get beaten so badly we shut down and don't analyse what we did wrong. it's very destructive to positive development \n","replies":[]},{"poster":"LetsTwitch","date":"2017-04-25T07:05:13.717+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Honestly, gold is more toxic than bronze. Sure players might be better on average, but if you make a mistake or have a rough game, they come down hard on you. Bronze are way more forgiving of mistakes\n\nOh and to those of you who keep trying to argue with someone about their build or a play, if their first response is \"no\" or something like that, give up. You will never convince them otherwise and it just sounds like, to put it bluntly, two autistic kids screeching at each other","replies":[]},{"poster":"Klavinmour","date":"2017-04-25T06:54:27.922+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The biggest issue I'm having with Ranked is the inconsistency with Match Making.\n\nMost games I play have horrible miss match of players, from the extreme inexperienced, to actual Plat/Diamond players that are somehow in Silver Elo games when their MMR is obviously good enough to have them in their Rank's Elo, and then you have the obvious WTF is this shit a Warwick with Windspeaker's Blessing Blue Smite and Runic Echos as his only damage item.\n\nThe worst part is this inconsistency is during PRIME TIME! The peak hours, the optimal time to be playing the game since most amount of people are on.\n\nThere is certainly more than enough players in Silver to be making practically every Silver ELO game SILVER ONLY, yet somehow Riot's match making fucks this up.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Slowdownn","date":"2017-04-25T06:09:24.092+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Smurfing may be a problem but these people will soon climb out of sight of that division. The real problem is the huge inconsistency in levels of players in the same division(bronze to gold). It seems the only way to climb is teaming up so you know the level your team is at. Riot's match making is broken and if you are peaked at a division then the only way to go is down when you solo.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Oliverr Queen","date":"2017-04-25T05:15:21.897+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Half the reason people flame and troll, is because they know nothing will happen. they don't care because riot wont do nothing. and yeah sure i can record or screen shot things of people trolling, but who really wants to go through all the effort to email riot, and then wait a week for them to get back to you with a result. its really unfair.\n\nI think they could come out with Perma mute for people or are consistently toxic and flame. also they should put a system in where if you troll in Ranked, make it so u can only play 2/3 ranked a day. for a certain period of time. teach people a lesson because its never going to stop.{{summoner:14}}","replies":[]}]}
