This is a champion concept I&#039;ve been tossing around for a few days, and I figured I&#039;d post it to see what you guys think. Hope you like!\r\n\r\nRobin, Elemental Grandmaster\r\n\r\nVisual design: An androgynous young person wearing a concealing hood and a long dark cloak. Noxian-style clothes. Holds a book that resembles a Fiendish Codex. Has a passing resemblance to the Avatar from Fire Emblem: Awakening (but with their distinguishing features concealed by the cloak).\r\n\r\nLore: The academies of Noxus produce the finest mages in Runeterra, but rarely do they produce someone with talent like Robin. Raised from birth in one of the highest houses of the bloody state, Robin has lived a blessed life by Noxian standards. Demonstrating an aptitude for three different forms of elemental magic - fire, wind and lightning - Robin was quickly set apart from the rest.\r\n\r\nThat was when Jericho Swain took a controlling interest in Robin&#039;s life. Now as the Grand General&#039;s apprentice, Robin has been stripped of a life of luxury and set on a dark path of the Master Tactician&#039;s devising. Little does Swain know that his manipulations do not go unnoticed...and they will not go unavenged.\r\n\r\n[](http://i.imgur.com/edwvJZE.png)\r\n\r\n&bull;\tMovement Speed: 335\r\n&bull;\tAttack Range: 450\r\n&bull;\tAttack Speed Growth : 2.3%\r\n&bull;\tBase Damage:  55.04\r\n&bull;\tDamage Growth :  3.2\r\n&bull;\tBase Armor: 19.22\r\n&bull;\tArmor Growth : 4\r\n&bull;\tBase HP: 511.68\r\n&bull;\tHP Growth: 76\r\n&bull;\tBase Mana: 324\r\n&bull;\tMana Per Level: 50 \r\n&bull;\tBase Magic Resist: 30\r\n&bull;\tMagic Resist Growth: 0\r\n&bull;\tBase HP Regen Per Second: 1.08\r\n&bull;\tHP Regen Per Second Growth: 0.11\r\n&bull;\tBase Mana Regen Per Second: 1.2\r\n&bull;\tMana Regen Per Second Growth : 0.16\r\n\r\nComments: Robin&#039;s base numbers are a hybrid between a burst mage like Annie and a tank mage like Swain. The general idea is that Robin&#039;s slightly less prone to exploding in a fine mist when looked at, but not able to wade directly into the fight either.\r\n\r\nAbilities\r\nP - Elemental Mastery\r\nWhenever Robin hits an enemy champion with an ability, he gains a stack of Elemental Mastery for 6 seconds. When he has two stacks of Elemental Mastery, his next spell will expend his stacks of Elemental Mastery to add additional effects and deal (+10 per level) pure damage to all enemy champions hit.\r\n\r\nComments: I actually came up with the &#039;three stacks that grant additional effects&#039; long before Tahm was announced, funnily enough. The difference here is that Robin builds stacks rather than applies them. The pure damage per level is meant to improve Robin&#039;s level scaling, to encourage solo laning.\r\n\r\nQ - Fires of War\r\nRange: 550\r\nCost: 70/80/90/100/110 mana\r\nCooldown: 13/12/11/10/9 seconds\r\nActive: Robin shoots out a torrent of elemental fire, dealing magic damage in a cone in front of him.\r\nElemental Mastery: Fires of War burns away at its targets, dealing magic damage over 3 seconds based on the target&rsquo;s maximum health.\r\nMagic Damage: 60 / 105 / 150 / 195 / 240 (+70% AP)\r\nDamage over Time: 2%/3%/4%/5%/6% of maximum health per second\r\nConic area of effect\r\n\r\nComments: Visually I imagine this spell is like a short, fast Rumble Q. It does somewhat less damage than Annie&#039;s W in exchange for a very powerful Mastery effect that shreds tanky enemies.\r\n\r\nW - Stroke of Genius\r\nRange: 500 (100 AoE)\r\nCost: 120 mana\r\nCooldown: 16 seconds\r\nActive: Robin calls down a thunderbolt, dealing magic damage in a small area and heavily slowing enemies hit.\r\nElemental Mastery: Stroke of Genius stuns its targets for the same duration instead of slowing.\r\nMagic Damage: 50 / 75 / 100 / 125 / 150 (+50% AP)\r\nSlow: 50%\r\nDuration: 1.1/1.2/1.3/1.4/1.5 seconds\r\nGround-targeted area of effect\r\n\r\nComments: If you&#039;ve ever played Zeus in Dota, I imagine this spell to be visually the same as his Lightning Bolt - a terrific crack of noise and light. It&#039;s a shortish, small-AoE CC effect that becomes a brutal stun when empowered by Robin&#039;s passive.\r\n\r\nE - Winds of Change\r\nRange: 700 (150/200/250/300/350 width)\r\nCost: 100 mana\r\nCooldown: 17/16/15/14/13 seconds\r\nActive: Robin lets out a powerful gale of wind in a straight line, pushing enemies back and destroying up to one projectile travelling towards him. Destroying a projectile with Winds of Change gives a stack of Elemental Mastery (no more than one stack can be gained by casting Winds of Change, however). Winds of Change pushes enemies further back the closer they are to Robin.\r\nElemental Mastery: The gale of wind lingers for 2 seconds, blocking enemy movement and all projectiles for that duration.\r\nGround-targeted area of effect\r\n\r\nComments: So this isn&#039;t a Wind Wall as much as it is a knockback that happens to work on projectiles. The push-back works similarly to Vel&#039;Koz E, where it pushes away from Robin&#039;s casting point. When empowered, it actually does become a wall, both Wind and otherwise - considering you&#039;re passing up on his other empowered effects, this seems like a fair trade off.\r\n\r\nR - Masterstroke\r\nRange: 300 (250 AoE)\r\nCost: 100/175/250 mana\r\nCooldown: 180/160/140 seconds\r\nActive: After a short delay, Robin channels ancient Noxian magic to create a vortex of dark energy near him, heavily damaging and slowing enemy units inside it for 2.5 seconds.\r\nElemental Mastery: Enemies caught in the Masterstroke are supressed instead of slowed, and they are drawn into the centre of the vortex over the duration.\r\nMagic damage: 75 / 150 / 225 (+45% AP) per second\r\nTotal magic damage: 225 / 450 / 675 (+135% AP)\r\nSlow: 80%\r\n\r\nComments: Oh boy. This effect probably looks familiar as the ultimate ability of a character in a MOBA. All I can say is that I think big game-winning spells should be more common in League then they are now, and this one has plenty of trade-offs, in between its short range, channeling requirement, and needing to be empowered to be proper hard CC.\r\n\r\n----\r\n\r\nThanks for reading!

And when he appears in most battles as a mage or even in SSBB for the Wii U, his name is Robin and he holds a book... He also features several spells of different elements...\n\nOn the other hand, I'd love to see a mage like this, I'm not sure how his skills would combo but he'd have to use all 3 in quick succession simply to proc one ability. I think the best combo would be R W Q E, for the most damage, putting a hard CC before and after the combo to doom whoever gets hit. Definitely make some elemental masteries stronger than others. I think Q should be weakest as solo laning requires the most damage and making Q the strongest or even worth the same and E, W or R would make it a no-brainer choice.\n\nE elemental mastery needs a lot of work. It's a straight line coming from Robin so the longer part will be hard to take advantage of if you want to use the knockup and elemental mastery gain too... It'll have to be a pretty fat AOE (like arcanopulse or Vel'koz's rift or larger) to match up the Q elemental mastery.","replies":[]},{"poster":"urbandonut","date":"2015-06-28T14:38:14.922+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"WOW i would love to play this champ :)","replies":[]}]}
