You write your name on the ticket, and you put it into one of five barrels. You can buy as many tickets as you like. Proceeds (or at least most) go to a charity nominated by Riot.\r\nEach barrel represents each role, top, jungle, etc.\r\n\r\nThen at some point either before or after the actual game starts, two tickets are pulled from each barrel to make two teams. Completely random skill levels. Random people get to play on the world stage for charity.\r\nI&#039;m sure there&#039;d be some more technical parts to it like contracts to not punch the screen when you feed or whatever, but how awesome would it be?\r\n\r\nI can&#039;t see anything wrong with it, except for maybe having a mega toxic diamond ADC with a bronze support. \r\nBut it&#039;d be cool, right. A man can dream.","replies":[{"poster":"Qweeeeerty","date":"2015-11-21T07:41:19.743+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'll give it to you bit of thought went into it, but as you said the most common worst case could be a bronze gets put in mid with a challenger mid.\n\nBut in all good faith it would all go to charity in the end which would be most welcomed I assume.\n\nIt would totally be a nerdgasm if I could get my name into that barrel and win if it was to happen though.\n{{sticker:slayer-pantheon-popcorn}}","replies":[]}]}
