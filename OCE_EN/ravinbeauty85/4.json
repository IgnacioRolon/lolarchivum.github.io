You are letting all your fellow ranked team members down. \n\nHere are some tips to take into consideration: \n* Stop relying only on the support to ward for you all... on the whole map - each player can place up to 3 stealth wards and 1 vision ward on the bloody map!! \n\nAt 20minutes into the game, Baron will spawn, he will have 6400 base health BUT he will gain 180 health every MINUTE you arent killing him. If you get to him with 2-3 team members you could have him killed in 15-30 seconds especially with the 2nd dragon stack of +15% damage to minions and monsters.\n\nNot only does he gain health he accumulates damage. Baron base attack damage is 240 +8 per minute. Has 120 armor and 70 magic resist.\n\nSo the new object of the game is to get in front of enemy team! so to make sure you can do this you will need two dragon stacks for your team - giving all your team players a permanent buff of  +15% damage to minions and monsters. \n\n* the adc, tank support and jungle should look into all having teleport making it easier to teleport to your turret, dragon, baron, other team members turrets, wards placed in enemy jungle, wards in enemy base to win the bloody game!!!\n\nThe players you want up at baron is adc,jungle and TANK support OR tank champion on your team BECAUSE Baron will attack the champion who is physically closest to it and you will want that to obviously be the TANK!\n\nthen continue to communicate to each other when dragon respawns every 6 minutes and baron 7 minutes.\n\nThe longer you wait to kill baron the more health and damage he has making killing him longer and harder.\n\nfor the newbie junglers here is some info to consider which monsters you are going to start with, and with a leash if need be\n\n**********************************************************************************************\nKrugx1/14 gold/50 exp – 540 health, damage output 35. 12 armor & -10 mag resist\nKrugx1/60 gold/150 exp – 1440 health, damage output 73. 12 armor & -10 mag resist  \n\nRed/36 gold/100 exp – 1800 health, damage output 80. 20 armor & 0 mag resist\nRed x2/20 gold/50 exp – 400 health, damage output 12. 8 armor & 0 mag resist\n\nRaptor/41 gold/140 exp – 1200 health, damage output 55. 15 armor & 0 mag resist\nRaptorx3/9 gold/20 exp – 250 health, damage output 20. 5 armor & 0 mag resist\n\nRift scuttle/35 gold/35 exp – 750 health, 60 armor & 60 mag resist\n\n*************************************************************************************************\nWolf/42 gold/142 exp – 1320 health, damage output 42. 9 armor & 0 mag resist\nWolves x2/12 gold/30 exp – 420 health, damage output 16. 6 armor & 0 mag resist\n\nGromp/62 gold/200 exp – 1600 health, damage output 90. 15 armor & 0 mag resist\n\nBlue/36 gold/100 exp – 2000 health, damage output 73. 20 armor & 0 mag resist \nBlue x2/20 gold/50 exp – 400 health, damage output 12. 8 armor & 0 mag resist\n\nRift scuttlee/35 gold/35 exp – 750 health, 60 armor & 60 mag resist\n\n**********************************************************************************************\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n","replies":[{"poster":"WEETBIX 4 BREKKI","date":"2015-01-19T14:39:24.325+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Even worse is people who tell people how to play a game designed to have fun?","replies":[]},{"poster":"Zero Infinity","date":"2015-01-18T16:39:34.674+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Excuse me Mr. Keep Updated but isn't 2nd dragon buff Tower Damage not Minion Damage?","replies":[]},{"poster":"SEKAI","date":"2015-01-18T11:23:47.666+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> you stubborn idiot know it all bronzies \n\nSuch as, you?\n\nOr your main is something like Silver 2 so you bring out your B5 acc instead?\n\nReally except the buff and Baron/Dragon timers and cycles everything else hardly matters, copy paste things you google'ed doesn't make you a pro at controlling the jungle.\n\nAm I saying that I am a Challenger pro? No no no, not at all. But you're an idiot if you think you are instead.\n\nThe only thing that I actually agree with you in this post is this\n> Stop relying only on the support to ward for you all...\n\nEDIT: Also killing Baron as soon as possible without accessing the enemy situation at all is asking to lose the game. And too many Teleport can backfire before Baron even spawned.","replies":[]},{"poster":"yoitspaul","date":"2015-01-18T09:59:14.409+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I LEIK, THUMBS UP!{{item:3710}}","replies":[]}]}
