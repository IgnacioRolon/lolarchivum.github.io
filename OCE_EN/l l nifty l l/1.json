In Gnars mega form he would be some sort of large white yeti/abominable snowman type creature and his 'q' (Boulder Toss\" might become a large snowball.\nThis is just a general idea, open for adaption, would greatly appreciate a response.\nThankyou.\n- NiftyNinja (OCE)\n\n**EDIT 1**: Would really appreciate it if after reading through this you either up/down-**vote**d the post in regards to your thoughts on the idea, thanks.\n\n**EDIT 2**: Just found somebody posting a very similar idea on Reddit about 2 months ago which wasn't exactly what I had in mind but managed to recieve over 2400 up votes. http://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/2hpjzm/art_abominable_snowgnar_skin_concept/\nHe/She has included an image of their idea which has been now been attached to this thread.\n\n**NOTE**: Credit for image goes to Reddit user **IfishIII** and/or \"Carlo Spacone\", as far as I know they/he/she made it.\n\n**EDIT 3**: Ty Rito (Gentleman Gnar is strikingly similar).","replies":[{"poster":"StrawberryVirus","date":"2015-01-19T14:49:36.941+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"This Looks Awesome!{{champion:150}} For the WIN!","replies":[{"poster":"l l Nifty l l","date":"2015-01-19T19:42:43.420+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Icybluecat,realm=OCE,application-id=hIjvqaz6,discussion-id=1NssfMmi,comment-id=0005,timestamp=2015-01-19T14:49:36.941+0000)\n>\n> This Looks Awesome!{{champion:150}} For the WIN!\n\nThankyou !","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Garens Harem","date":"2015-01-04T03:49:46.836+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"maybe nec year","replies":[]},{"poster":"Benjaten","date":"2015-01-04T03:48:39.024+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Like it!","replies":[]},{"poster":"FetusDeletus1","date":"2014-12-26T13:16:07.413+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Cool idea.","replies":[]},{"poster":"l l Nifty l l","date":"2015-01-07T10:42:30.153+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thanks for the positive comments :3","replies":[]}]}
