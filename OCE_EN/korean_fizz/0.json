'gg ez'","subforum":"Gameplay & Strategy","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I&#039;ve seen a couple streamers saying &#039;gg ez&#039; &#039;gg ez af&#039; etc. I ain&#039;t no snitch and don&#039;t want them to get banned etc, but my question is, is it actually bannable? I see chat spamming &#039;BANNED&#039; etc. Say if you were to not talk all game and simply say &#039;gg ez&#039;, is it possible for a perma ban? Would really like if a Riot employee could answer, would be more &#039;convinced&#039;?\r\n\r\nNote: I know its toxic bla bla, i&#039;ve said it before, people have said it to me. Personally I don&#039;t think it&#039;s that toxic, maybe a bit unsportsmanlike.","replies":[{"poster":"QAPLA","date":"2018-01-30T01:12:18.098+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"It's fine to have \"gay\", \"%%%\", etc in your club name, but \"gg ez\" is considered bad, lmao.\n\n[edit] The moderated word was a bundle of sticks.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Mozzie25","date":"2018-01-29T23:05:11.820+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Not bannable but annoying as fuck","replies":[]},{"poster":"QAPLA","date":"2018-01-29T22:12:10.050+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"If anyone is offended by \"GG EZ\", then their skin must be thinner than rice paper.","replies":[{"poster":"00shots00","date":"2018-01-30T03:37:12.320+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"have you played on OCE before? everyone is soft","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"catch this work","date":"2018-01-31T13:48:35.272+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I mean, it's effectively you taunting the other player and going against the summoner code of being \"sportsmanlike\".

Yea its not nice, but it also makes you look pretty pathetic when you get deeply offended by it.\n\nSome people are bad losers, or bad winners, if you took away all those people, league probably wouldn't have enough players to survive.\nI for one would rather have a few bad eggs in the bunch, \nthan not actually have the bunch at all.","replies":[{"poster":"JasonWazza","date":"2018-01-30T07:52:58.020+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":">Personally I think that it being a reportable offence is the bridge too far\n\nI mean, usually it's said by the tosser that was being a tosser in team chat, which i think comes into it.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"ThatsBS","date":"2018-01-29T22:45:00.908+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Its something you wouldnt say when your shaking hands at the end of a sport.
