I can&#039;t get over the lockin function and how infuriating it is.\r\n\r\nThe fact you actually have to lock in a champion now is pissing me off, my behavior is so locked in to the old ranked system and when you don&#039;t hit lock in you get kicked with a 5 minute ban even though you&#039;ve chosen a champion... I wait until the clock ticks down to make a decision and not realizing you have to lock in now.. 30 minute ban yesterday for doing it twice in a fucking row.  And u even get marked as a loss in promos...\r\n\r\nI don&#039;t know if its been changed in this new patch but i used to browse around FB or youtube until it was my turn to pick and the client would come to the front of my screen.\r\nNow it&#039;s pay attention all the way through lobby or eat a 5 minute ban.","replies":[{"poster":"Lord Sesshomaru","date":"2016-02-24T07:10:45.655+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"http://boards.oce.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/miscellaneous/QJEnqkvc-time-to-face-reality-serious-point-though\n\nits ridiculous","replies":[]}]}
