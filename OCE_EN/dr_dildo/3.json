I find it very annoying having to play games with toxic players it really ruines this whole game. I feel as bringing the tribunal back could possibly reduce these type of players as they will know. they will be punished rather then getting away with it over and over again. Riot please take this into consideration as I really think it will help.","replies":[{"poster":"Glow","date":"2016-08-23T00:37:10.700+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I really liked the tribunal too but I don't think it will be brought back as it was previously. Riot is currently updating it (features like reform cards are part of this) so hopefully in the future we see something similar that we can use! \nIt's never fun to encounter a toxic player, but I don't think you're supposed to call them out by name on the forums - reporting them after the game would be best :)","replies":[{"poster":"DR DILDO","date":"2016-09-21T07:34:13.504+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"well seeing as their is a forums where you report a player i thought i'd add his name so in future if anyone plays with him they know what to expect.","replies":[{"poster":"JimmyBoy","date":"2016-09-21T07:47:28.336+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Dr. D here are the rules for the forum, just in case you are unsure of something.\n\nhttp://boards.oce.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/announcements/BjArMH2B-boards-universal-rules\n\nHave a good day bud","replies":[]}]}]}]}
