I'm not going to speak in absolutes because we don't have the full story here.\n___\n**Negative History:**\n\nNegative history is cumulative on an account. If you get reported a lot, but for minor offences, eventually you will be punished for the culmination of those offences. This negative history can leave you on thin ice, especially if it continues between actual punishments. You allude to your last three games being negative, so this is definitely a factor here, just a matter of how much.\n___\n**Prior Punishments:**\n\nIf you had no prior punishments this would not have been a permanent suspension. The nature and number of those prior offences has a big impact on the why of this one. While this wouldn't be a punishment worthy log for someone with a clean slate, it may well be for someone with an extensive negative history and prior punishments. Not knowing the state of your account I couldn't tell you.\n\nYou would have also been made aware from those punishments that continued violation of the ToS would result in harsher punishments. If you received a 14 day ban at some point you would have been made aware that your next punishment had every likelihood of being a permanent suspension.\n___\n**False Positives:**\n\nThere is of course the possibility that this was a false positive. You quoted the Karma in context, but it may have been misinterpreted by the system as you simply saying what she did. If this is the case you **_might_** have a case to have the punishment revoked or reduced. This depends entirely on the other factors surrounding the punishment.\n___\n**Severity vs Consistency:**\n\nThis comes up a lot. Just because you were punished, doesn't mean they weren't. If they were saying the things you claim they were, then I can pretty much guarantee they faced consequences for it. Severe behaviour is a quick way to get punished yes, but consistent negative behaviour will see the same result, only much slower.\n\nTo use a metaphor, filling up a bath one cup at a time is a lot slower that just dumping a bath load of water in all at once, but you will still eventually fill up the bath. Never having used homophobic or racist language, or told someone to 'kys', doesn't mean your behaviour hasn't negatively affected others. \n___\n**Refunds:**\n\nIn short, the answer is no. If an account is legitimately banned, you will not receive any refunds. You agreed to the ToS and the EULA, and do again most patches. In doing so you are agreeing to the terms of using (get it) the service (your account), and in breaking those terms forfeit your right to that service. \n\nBefore it comes up again, whether from you or someone else: No, it isn't illegal. Yes, Riot have every right to do this. No, Riot have no obligation to compensate you in any way for preventing the use of your account.\n\nIf an account was illegitimately banned, Riot will restore access to the account.\n___\n**Appeals:**\n\nNow, with all that said, this *could* still be a false positive given the nature of the log. The negative history and prior punishments mean it might also not be. If you wish to appeal your punishment, contact player support and they will investigate the punishment: https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/requests/new\n___\n**When contacting support:**\n\n1. Submit one ticket and one ticket only. Do not reply to the ticket until you have received a response from support unless you absolutely have to add more info. Doing either will bump you back to the bottom of the queue.\n2. Support will typically respond within 24 hours, but depending on their ticket load it may be close to two or three days so keep the above in mind.\n3. Be specific. Support are busy, and if you ask a yes or no question like \"will my account be unbanned?\" you will get a yes or no answer. If you want more, you will have to ask for it.\n4. Be respectful. Support is far more likely to dig a little deeper and give you context if you are mindful of them being actual human beings. They only have to answer your query, anything extra they do in the way of context is because they want to help.","replies":[]},{"poster":"QAPLA","date":"2018-05-14T21:21:15.302+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Although I would consider that 'toxic' chat, I don't see it as ban worthy.\n\nGood luck on your appeal (but I don't know what you said in other games, which is probably what got you banned, not this).","replies":[]}]}
