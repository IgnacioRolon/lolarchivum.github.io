O_o\n\nBut yea, the number of times I get S/S+when im lvl 5, and S- when Im level 6 is infuriating. Just pure luck that those games happened that way round, sometimes right after each other.\n\nIf/when they do the next levels, maybe they should have some kind of goal, like get 10,000 CS and 300 kills, and 700 assists. That way people can just constantly be working towards their goals, completing bit by bit. That way when you see a lvl 8 you can think \"Daymn, that guy has over X kills with that champ.\" Rather than \"Maybe he got lucky 2 games?\"\n\nGetting an S should be a good thing, but when you're lvl 6, an S- is the most demoralising score you can get, and that shouldn't be the case.\n\nI wouldn't say it's all luck, but it definitely has an influence.\nAlso I have no idea how you're supposed to use \"Money\" to get the mastery?","replies":[{"poster":"slxw","date":"2018-12-07T14:35:16.442+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Well to get the mastery you must have tokens / shards / essence / ... some of these can be bought.\n\nwhen I say that lvl 7 mastery is a joke, I say it because I know.\nI say it because I have it, I know its dumb luck because I'm b5, getting a few 's' scores is just going to happen.\n\nmastery lvl 7 is not an indication of a good player, nor per say is the persons rank,\n\neg - \" I have 46 lvl champs\"","replies":[{"poster":"Lord Sesshomaru","date":"2018-12-07T15:10:47.311+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"> tokens / shards / essence / ... some of these can be bought.\n\nI was sympathetic of your point at first, but now I can see this is a mindless rant.\nYou're clutching at straws with this comment.\nYou can buy chests, chests that when opened give you the possibility of getting a shard or blue essence. Both of which can be obtained freely and easily through playing the game.  The one thing that requires you to get an S for, cannot be bought. You're talking through your teeth.\n\nYou have it? Cool We all have Mastery 7 on multiple champs, and most of us like having it.\nYea sometimes you get lucky and get the perfect situation and get an S. Sometimes you work damn hard and don't get one, and sometimes you work damn hard and do.\n\nNo one has ever said that having a mastery 7 champion proves you're the best. It's a nice flair to show that you've played the champ enough to get lvl 5 and have continued playing long enough to get some S's. \n\nIt's not a big deal.\nYes it involves some luck, but no more or less than ranked. No more or less than winning games.\n\nHave a think about what Mastery 7 is supposed to actually be. Is it true 'mastery' of a champ? no of course not, then only a couple of people in the world would have it.  So what is it? it's supposed to be a little reward for people who put time into a certain champion. Does it fulfil that role? Yes.\n\nCould the system for earning it be better? Yea probably.\nIs it hurting anyone? No.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"DarkSoul1994","date":"2018-12-07T13:28:52.826+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I have 46 Champions at Mastery 7.

Learn the champs with the most favorable effort-to-benefit ratio first - work your way up to the tricky ones.\n\nMost importantly, know the champions that aren't worth mastering - they probably need a rework anyway.","replies":[{"poster":"slxw","date":"2018-12-07T14:11:22.897+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"this is what I mean, your telling me that your a true \"master level player\" at 46 champions?\n\nit feels more like every body gets a trophy day, with the new ranked system should come mastery  lvl 8.","replies":[{"poster":"DarkSoul1994","date":"2018-12-07T23:59:38.622+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"If we wanted a mastery system that actually showed mastery, it would make you play ranked and force you to play X number of games before it showed what rank you earned your mastery at.\n\nWould be a good way to deal with 1,000,000 Mastery 7 players who are hardstuck Bronze after 700 games.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"DarkShade918","date":"2018-12-09T08:44:33.398+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"**Is mastery 7 with 48 champs, and 19 further at mastery 6**\n**Also have over 400000 mastery points on all bar 2 mastery 7s**\n**Still not indication of skill**\n\n{{sticker:slayer-jinx-unamused}}","replies":[]},{"poster":"slxw","date":"2018-12-07T16:00:31.503+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"um, yeah, looking back at my account, lvl 7 mastery is old bronze at best.","replies":[]}]}
