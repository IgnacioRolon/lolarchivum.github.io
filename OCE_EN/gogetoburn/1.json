It increases every 4 lvls\r\n\r\nSo, to talk about the most crappy passive in the game is sad but how about make it better,\r\n\r\nSo lets see lvl 4, {{champion:29}}  twitch would generally have more trades and seeing the passive after landing 6 aa(impossible unless a=enemy is afk) you deal 108 true damage but lets see{{champion:51}}  caitlyn passive at lvl 4(since we ask for 6 aa we will have {{champion:51}} cait in a bush just more possible tho) we deal 2 headshots in bush that is  surely more than 108 true dmg\r\n\r\nLate - Game, this passive is said to scale but it becomes more useless, 216 true dmg can easily be sustained back up by enemy adc items so it doesnt scale but actually becomes more useless. Not only that if any {{champion:29}} twitch lands 6 aa, he is surely to lane in some cc as to aa them 6 times even with ult range that would give enemy nearly 2.5 to 3 seconds to cc u and in higher elo&#039;s the will aim for that\r\n\r\nI play twitch and its only and only use is a 5% chance to steal the camp u are leashing( for me its like 50%-60%) \r\n\r\nI have nvr seen it grant a kill and hope some buffs are given to this passive like maybe u reach its max stacks in 3 aa as that is possible without getting cc&#039;ed or u can give him bonus ad when passive procs on enemy champs(like  {{champion:122}}   darius just that  {{champion:122}}   darius has a 100 times more better passive) or also make is scale off ad or attack speed or crit or somethin like that, any buffs welcome u can aslo make it physical damage and give it HIGHER damage so {{item:3071}}  might be a good option on him\r\n\r\nI also want to tell u on twitch where this passive has some great synergies that is red smite + passive + red buff and it ticks leona passive but nothing i have seen apart from that\r\n\r\nPlease dont say that x champion has a worser passive, if u want to know this post&#039;s objective is to raise awareness on twitch passive and by no means {{champion:122}} darius or {{champion:51}} caitlyn nerfs","replies":[{"poster":"CHEESYLEEKS","date":"2016-01-10T02:21:39.494+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Not the worst imho","replies":[]},{"poster":"DragonOfTheVoid","date":"2016-01-09T23:32:36.461+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"{{champion:67}} 1k true damage","replies":[]}]}
