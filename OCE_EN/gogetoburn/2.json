You don&#039;t only get the same damage from the same gold but you also gain additional mana to use even more spells.\n2. The Mana you bought will later on give you even more damage when you finally upgrade your Tear Of The Goddess to Archangel Staff.\n3. Enemies will get mind blown when they see how low your Ability Power is and actually UNDERESTIMATE your damage output.\n\nSO PLEASE WHATEVER YOU DO BUFF HIS MANA RATIOS\nAND ALSO PUT A FEW OF THE OTHER RECOMMENDATIONS IN IT","replies":[{"poster":"Bambooze","date":"2015-11-03T10:20:42.193+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"If you saw Faker play Ryze in Worlds, you'll know he doesn't need a buff at all :p","replies":[]},{"poster":"Azirious Mistake","date":"2015-10-18T21:36:56.364+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"as a champion who is retarded late game I feel that Ryze's win rate is fine as is in the League of Early Game meta.","replies":[{"poster":"Gogetoburn","date":"2015-10-19T07:01:23.954+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Well you must know that ryze mid has a 41.56% win rate.

His aim is literally to survive the laning phase and get his roa and tear stacking. He is not meant to be strong early. \n> \nbuff his mana ratios to what it was earlier\nmake his passive like on casting 4 spells so you can actually use it\ni am ok with the fact that he has no gapcloser but you can makes his q slow or increase the root on his w so that he doesnt die to every single gank\nlower his w cooldown actually all his abilities cuz if the lane is shoved he can ult the wave so he aint miss all of the cs\n>\nBuff his mana ratios?  You understand the concept of being able to kill a ryze don't you, he already does enough damage in my opinion and if he gets crushed in lane he should be able to just have a fully stacked tear and roa and be able to one combo people.\nHis passive is fine, there is actually strategy to it, being able to manage it and not having it activate in one rotation is a part of what makes it balanced. You don't even need to hit your q to activate it you know? not that hard to manage.\nSlow on q. No, just no, point and click snare is enough.\nLower his w cooldown? DID YOU EVEN SEE ****ING PERMA SNARE RYZE? its not getting lowered ever.\nTl;dr, ryze is a hyper carry and should lose the laning phase to most champs except his counter picks, Hes in a alright spot at the moment and has fair counter play, imo he is one of riots balanced champions at the moment.\nFYI, if you have 40 cs and two deaths by the end of the laning phase you probably either picking him into a lane bully which he is meant to lose to or you are really bad at ryze.","replies":[]},{"poster":"SorakaXHealBoT","date":"2015-10-19T17:43:29.134+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Gogetoburn,realm=OCE,application-id=FjGAIbRv,discussion-id=03ERwyTi,comment-id=000100000000,timestamp=2015-10-19T06:53:33.286+0000)\n>\n> He is op late game but is he is the most extremely item dependent ap top laner.
