I've tried running the repair, restarting, checking my IP configurations, disabling my firewall and disabling anti virus completely. I've tried looking elsewhere but no other threads have an answer on how to fix? Can anyone please help me?\r\n\r\nOn top of other recent tries for solutions, disabling P2P, disabling IPv6, flushing DNS, releasing/resetting IP, reinstalling .NET framework 3.5, 4.0 and 4.5 as suggested.\r\nNOTHING HAS WORKED.\r\nRiot, please. Help.\r\n\r\nAlso, I've tried this on TWO different internet connections. Still no luck.\r\n\r\n\r\nAfter deleting the folder \"lol_launcher\" in Riot games > League of Legends > RADS > projects > lol_launcher\r\nThen running the repair again and still having no luck..My friend suggested trying to see if it would update when i tried swapping to NA region. When I went to change my region, I noticed the region wasn't properly set? It said Brazil. So after everything I've done today, then noticing the region wasn't set correctly, it went on updating perfectly fine after i set it back to OCE region. (Note that even though the region wasn't properly set, the logs STILL said it was in region oc1, but still wouldn't allow the the launcher to update).\r\n\r\nAlso, earlier in the day, i refreshed my settings with both of my internet connections to \"drop ping\" with regedit and MSMQ enabling. I you haven't done this, it may be worth a try to stop the error. Just google it. \"Lower ping with regedit\".\r\n\r\nHope this helps some people, remember to double check your regions every time it opens.","replies":[{"poster":"HORSE OF FORCE","date":"2015-01-29T10:56:55.458+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Now that's something I haven't seen before.
