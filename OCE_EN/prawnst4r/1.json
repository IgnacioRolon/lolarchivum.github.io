I have already formed a club of Nunu mains in OCE and currently have 23 members. If you wish to join, you must have Nunu in your top 3 champions for ranked or show some dedication towards maining it. We invite people from ALL ELO as long as you are a main. You must also sleep in a refrigerator. \n\nIt is a fun and ACTIVE club where we post memes, chit chat randomly, brag about stream sniping IWD, discuss builds and play styles. We answer questions thoughtfully and with clarity. I as the leader have a diamond 1 (70% wr Nunu) and diamond 2 account (main) as of right now, I have hit Masters and can be of some help if you need. \n\nFeel free to add me. \n\n_Prawnst4r_","replies":[]}
