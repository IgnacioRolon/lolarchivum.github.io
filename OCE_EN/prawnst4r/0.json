My ping is normal for all that time. This is a weird connection problem, I encountered it at about 3:30am and it seems to happen only to me. I am still using old client. Does anybody know what is going on? I feel bad for giving my team a lose they didn&#039;t deserve. I dont think it is my net it has something to do with the game itself.","replies":[{"poster":"crackshot ","date":"2017-01-28T10:27:03.022+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"yep getting something similar, more often than not i keep moving the direction i last clicked. but this is only for like 1-2 seconds. its so anoying. ping just say 34 whole time. like hasnt moved from 34 all month","replies":[]},{"poster":"SephirothSG","date":"2017-01-25T07:37:57.557+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Could you do the following for me,\n\n* [Switch to a public DNS](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues#wq5)\n* [Download WinMTR](https://sourceforge.net/projects/winmtr/files/WinMTR-v092.zip/download) and run a traceroute to the following IP.
