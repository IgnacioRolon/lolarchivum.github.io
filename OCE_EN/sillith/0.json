Not 50%, not 75%, it&#039;s 100%. There will always be people spamming in chat from the first death till the end.\r\nAnd there&#039;s nothing to be done to resolve this issue. Riot takes no action at all to even mitigate the issue. They just let it happen to continue building their fancy &#039;League universe&#039;, as if their main task is making movies rather than an actual game.\r\nI&#039;m fed up with this shit. I can&#039;t believe I&#039;ve had enough even before ranked and I can&#039;t imagine how ranked game will be like in Oceania.\r\n\r\nSaying &#039;why don&#039;t you just mute them all&#039; is like when there&#039;s a fire in the building and, instead of urging the firefighters to put it off, you tell the others &#039;why don&#039;t you just ignore them and take a detour?&#039;\r\n\r\nYou might as well remove the chat function as a whole.","replies":[{"poster":"TheDemonEmperor","date":"2018-09-13T09:43:12.357+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Or...
