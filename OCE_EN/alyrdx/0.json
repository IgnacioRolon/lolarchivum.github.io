Was hard to tell if it was just a visual bug or actual damage bug, because our team was so far behind when I realised. But I feel it wasn&#039;t applying bonus damage.","replies":[{"poster":"SephirothSG","date":"2016-09-04T00:09:37.823+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey there,\n\nI saw a report of this a couple days ago, it does seem to be a visual bug only however it is persistant, afaik.\n\nYou should head over to the [Report a Bug](http://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/bug-report) board and post about it there, please be sure to read the [How to Report a Game Bug](http://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/bug-report/3mQGBEjA-how-to-report-a-game-bug) thread before posting :).","replies":[]}]}
