(insert excuse&#039;s below you know you want to)\r\nsurprised riot mentioned bringing back honoring the enemy. like they could fix a lot they been leaving since season 1, 2 etc. but i guess thats a nice gesture.","replies":[{"poster":"Niji","date":"2018-01-06T06:47:07.723+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Oh also having a non-smartcast mode wouldn't do anything against these bots if you understood how they work.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Niji","date":"2018-01-06T06:46:04.780+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Smartcasting actually makes hitting skillshots harder technically due to not having the indicator. It just exists to make skillshots non-clunky feeling. A lot of times players want to hit something hard to hit they regular cast it due to it being easier to judge the travel distance and exact path the projectile will take.\n\nAlso personally yeah I never surrender but if 1 person could outvote 4 people then just one player alone could literally hold his entire team hostage for a long ass time. I really fucking hate being the one who votes no but still has to surrender personally but its completely logical how the system works.","replies":[]},{"poster":"TheDemonEmperor","date":"2018-01-06T06:10:30.119+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Uh, what? you cant tell if some 1 is scripting or not, and you think smartcast is the cause? You do realise you still have to aim correctly; Smart cast or not right?\n\nSurrender vote is for the majority of the team to decide on. Ussually it is used in hopeless situations such as: players are behind massively, or people just hate each others and dont cooperate. There is a saying, a sign of exprience is knowing when a battle is lost. If you think admitting defeat is weak; Then all i'll say is, you're not smart enough to lead.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Psylock1234","date":"2018-01-06T07:42:30.142+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"about the surrendering are you Darius or something also it is a valid point about lowering honour but I think when you surrender it is more accept defeat before you start to get really tilted but remakes are just dishonorable","replies":[]}]}
