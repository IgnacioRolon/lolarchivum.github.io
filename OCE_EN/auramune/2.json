If you received a punishment before you went inactive and received a punishment after you came back, the system can't determine that you actually made progress on reform. This is likely the reason you received a permanent suspension rather than any other punishment. \n\nIf you feel like this ban was given in error, you always have the option to have Riot Player Support to re-examine your suspension:\n\nhttps://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/requests/new","replies":[]}]}
