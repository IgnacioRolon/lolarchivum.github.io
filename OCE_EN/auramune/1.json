After losing a game with my mains getting banned and having a really fed Kayn on the other team and finding out your account got perm banned after a game, does things to you.. But yea thanks.","replies":[{"poster":"Fitzky","date":"2017-10-24T03:22:09.214+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"Wrong mindset? Doesn't matter what happened in that game mate, once your account is perma banned THATS IT. There is no chance, no matter how hard you appeal for it, that it's EVER coming back. No perma banned account HAS EVER been unbanned with the exception of a few people who have been incorrectly banned because of script accusations.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Wuks","date":"2017-10-24T13:23:20.703+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey there! I responded to your other thread here:\n\nhttps://boards.oce.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/help-support-oce/15rrWP5x-help?comment=0000\n\nI will note, however, that spending money on the game doesn't excuse toxicity. Players who have received a punishment are expected to adjust their behaviour to more closely align with community-acceptable behaviour. Let me know if you have any questions.","replies":[]}]}
