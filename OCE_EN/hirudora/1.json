Regardless Primary or Secondary.\r\nIf you see this game from my perspective there really isn&#039;t a lot of freedom for players to do what we want.\r\nFeels like i&#039;m forced to pick support for players who don&#039;t want to play support. Makes sense ?\r\nSo why should I gain so little LP for a victory and lose more from a defeat ?\r\nShould I wait up to 5 minutes. Who wants to wait that long for a match. \r\n\r\nI think there should be a new lobby page. Have our own individual lobby and we can see everyone else\r\nand allow players to select any Champion and read it&#039;s strength and weaknesses. \r\n\r\nThere needs to be more to this game. I&#039;m kinda lost with the whole skins thing and the naming of Champions.\r\nPlease save your guys energy time and money on Champion names. Talking about &quot;Pool Party&#039; or &quot;SKT&quot; ect...\r\nWhen you change a Champions name tittle you change the back ground story line and not only that a lot of the skins now looks like another Champion.\r\nPoppy and Tristan look basically identical.\r\nFrostblade Irelia looks like Ahri due to Irelia&#039;s eyes and short hair. \r\nDo they even care about how skins look ?    \r\nMiss Fortune. She&#039;s a pirate bounty hunter not an arcade character. \r\nMake better pirate skins perhaps ?\r\n\r\nDota 2 you have the option to customize your Champion to suit the story line and keep the original name. \r\nCreate Champions from any time frame, past, future or present and stick with that world. \r\nYou guys are already doing it, just in the wrong kind of way. \r\n\r\nI understand this is a money making business I get that. But where&#039;s the player to profile experience ? \r\nWe have our own summoner profile but can&#039;t do much with it other than setting runes and mysteries.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWe need a new MOBA who can offer us the full gaming experience.","replies":[{"poster":"Darthski","date":"2016-02-09T19:16:22.594+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"This post is all over the place man.

Your complaint makes no sense. You have just as much chance to play jg/top/mid as any other player. Also you will be losing LP overall because your winrate is not very good over some time period. That's the real purpose of ranked. It's not an 'only climb' system. It's for placing you in the correct skill ranking. ","replies":[]}]}
