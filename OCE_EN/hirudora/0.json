How i know this is because every single time i lost i added those players to see how many normal matches they had played and it was always between 100 and 160 normal wins, then i remove them.\r\n\r\nBefore i stated rank i won 860 normal games that's probably hitting 2000 games in total give or take.\r\n\r\nThese days as soon as you hit level 30 or have 100 normal wins under your're belt you can play rank. I don't even know if a player has a full set of rune pages dedicated to each role and lane or champion at 100 normal wins, \r\n\r\nIt honestly sucks and playing League of Legends now is just not fun anymore. The benchmark to enter rank is way to soft or to low. \r\n\r\nPlayers need more game time in normal matches and maybe have the normal win limit of 100 wins set to 500 wins before you can even think about playing with the big boys. \r\n\r\nFrom here on i'm posing every single game that i lose from an unskilled player in my team. I have lost more games than i have won due to other players in my team that are unskilled.\r\n\r\nIt would be nice to see more stats on other players also before or after the match, how many normal wins each player has played, maybe give players achievements for the amount of normal matches they win. \r\n\r\nI also think every player should start off in bronze no matter what, and work their way up from there. And you can't drop from a class.\r\n\r\nIf a player is new to rank and was lucky enough to win 6+ wins for his placements and was put in silver and had no idea the skill level involved would only ruin  the game for his team, as this constantly happened to me.\r\n\r\nEvery game i'm about to start i'm expecting to lose, it doesn't matter what lane or role i play.\r\n\r\nI'm not looking for any arguments as such, this is how i'v seen the game through my eyes.\r\nPlease don't make smart cheap shot replies, this is clearly an issue.\r\nLearn how to carry a team is not an answer to what i have written down.","replies":[{"poster":"Lord Kylar Alice","date":"2015-01-26T04:33:40.675+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":0,"body":"> Every game i'm about to start i'm expecting to lose, it doesn't matter what lane or role i play.\n\nThis is the biggest reason you're losing.","replies":[{"poster":"Hirudora","date":"2015-01-26T04:44:56.803+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"This is a computer game like all other games out there, you learn from your mistakes so you can clock the game.\n\nThere is no joy being teamed up with unskilled players before the game has even started \n\nThere is no joy in my matches when i lose after trying  everything i can to help\n\nGoing back to bronze is a real kick in the guts","replies":[{"poster":"Project Xayah","date":"2015-01-27T05:55:37.329+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"***","replies":[{"poster":"Hirudora","date":"2015-01-27T09:07:48.916+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Whats your definition on suck ?\nAs support i can go through a whole game and not die whilst having the most amount of assists in the match as Leona of course.\nSorry man but if you want to add me and find out for yourself, i'll show you i don't suck.\nThe ranking system is crap\nTo many noobs in rank\nWhats the point having normal matches then ?\nWhats the point having bot matches ?\nRiot should just have rank play and forget about normal and bot matches, everyone else is","replies":[{"poster":"Project Xayah","date":"2015-01-27T09:50:08.683+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Jinuku,realm=OCE,application-id=Ntey9fRZ,discussion-id=I7faPlz5,comment-id=0001000000000000,timestamp=2015-01-27T09:07:48.916+0000)\n>\n> Whats your definition on suck ?\n\nBronze/Silver/Gold players.\n\nAnd I say that with a main in Silver.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Nature","date":"2015-01-28T09:25:40.827+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Just quit the game if you can't handle what's been happening for years.

I agree with you in part on that fact. However, some people learn at different rates due to a whole heap of factors, such as that person's willingness to accept their mistakes. Are you accepting your mistakes? It does not seem so, as you seem to only accept that your teammates are bad. Maybe you don't belong in bronze at all. Some people do get placed there. You aren't necessarily stuck there though. What should you do then? Both teams will be of around equal MMR, and if your MMR is lower than it should be then you can make that an advantage for your team. The other option is duo queuing with someone higher to play with the people you feel are on your level. This could mean one of two things: you'll be winning games fine and you won't be a burden to your team, and you will be gaining LP faster for playing against people higher than your MMR. The other possibility is that you will be a burden. Maybe you will be a burden (I wouldn't know, I don't play with you). However, that isn't necessarily a bad thing. It is what you make of it. It could be a humbling experience that shows you that you need to make changes and learn before you can get yourself out of where you are.\nI have played with people on 100 wins who are better than those with 1000. In addition, the general consensus is that playing ranked is the best way to improve. What you are saying is that you want people to improve without using the queues that are generally best for improvement?\n\nWe're always going to be held back from time to time by teams who can't work well with each other, and people who are not performing to the expected standard. However, if you deserve to be higher, you should be winning more games than you are losing. Even if you are held back a lot, you can climb, even if it is slowly.

Don't ever expect anyone to carry you. Only weak minded people do that. I just gave some suggestions that you might like to try and see if you yourself could carry.\nYou won't always be last pick, btw.\n\nIf it is of any interest, i am nearly bronze IV ) And yes i'm on a losing streak like you. :)","replies":[{"poster":"Hirudora","date":"2015-01-30T07:31:16.294+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hi man, i'll always do my best, having a girlfriend, job friendships and even gaming i give it my all and learn to be a better player and friend.\n\nNo matter what lane i go i do my best, when i'm support and were retreating back to base from enemy base i always ward behind us, i don't see that a lot. \nI don't expect people to carry me, it's just sad having unskilled players constantly.

I can prove to you what i mean would take a lot of screen shots but if i have a zed mid he fails yet if the other team has zed mid he owns us like wise with riven, fizz, kat etc...\n\nI'v played 5 games today all 5 losses, when i was top i really tried to help my team but was absolutely nothing i could do, i was 4/0 me being Panth verse Fiora and i know i can destroy Fiora which i did so she was lucky to be carried by the rest of her team unlike myself i was unlucky to have this team basically.\n\ni base it all on luck, people disagree with me which is fine but how i see it i'm the unlucky one to have being placed with these players organized by the bot system, i was unlucky to have a unskilled support rather than a skilled support.\n\nI do mute people man, to be honest i'm at the stage where i don't even have sound coming from the game anymore i just listen to George Fm in the back ground.\n\nFor me and how i see this game i would say the first 10-15 minutes is the most crucial part of the game and decides the out come of the match, NOT all matches are the same and the turn of the tide can happen at the end, don't get me wrong i have won matches where we were behind in kills due to out team comps being that little bit better. But often for me and only me first ten minutes tells me if were going to win or not. \n\nNobody rages at me because every game i don't actually do anything wrong, i may make a mistake but who doesn't. At least i know what i did wrong and do better but the players i'm with they don't know what they did wrong and continue to do it.\n\nI hope you have more luck than i do because after 3 years playing, this year going on my fourth and i'm back where i started it's not a nice feeling.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Bookbash","date":"2015-01-28T12:01:46.680+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"OK Jinuku, I am going through what you are also going through atm. But I have a plan.\n\nI think playing support you will not be able to carry your team unless you are a good leader and people listen to you. ---> Youtube \"Pakushy - How to be a captain\" for ideas.\n\nOther youtube videos have ideas on how to escape solo queue \"hell\" by suggesting that you learn some champions that can carry, i.e. mid laners. \n\nThis is my first season in ranked (started LoL in June 2014), and in normals my MMR for games were around 1200-1400 most of the time. In provs I started with 5 losses, then 4 wins, then a loss, mostly due to the kind of idiots you mention that are either not ready for ranked or afkers. It happens. My MMR for those games were around 800-900. I was put into Bronze I. After a few games the next day I was in Bronze III. So I understand what you are going through. So you could wait until the season settles down and then play ranked, and then most of the noobs will be in Bronze V. In the meantime train up your mid lane skills?\nOr you could do what I'm doing now, and just continuing to play, focusing on your own game, and seeing how it goes. I also created a ranked team and so far we have 2/2 with average MMR for the games around 1500. Ranked teams may solve your annoyances :)\n\nAs a final resort you could google, \"LoL elo boosting\". Costs about $US150 on average to put you back in silver division I, if you would pay for that, and then you could just carry on at your normal level, if that is your normal level.\n\nGood Luck!","replies":[{"poster":"Hirudora","date":"2015-01-28T22:24:36.117+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'm support a lot of the time because i let others call their lanes and i just fill, like most skilled players would say in lobby \"fill\"\nSo many times players call their lanes mid top jg and then end up being 0/5 in ten minutes, so what was the point in calling a lane ?\nThey might as well take on a new role and they might actually like it if they never played adc or support before, but not in rank go learn a new role in norms.\nThanks for the comment \nHappy gaming","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Niji","date":"2015-01-28T09:36:04.246+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"OP must be a crocodile{{champion:58}}  cuz he is in da Nile xdxd, a few games here an there yeah it may be unrealistic for you to carry but if you smell %%%% everywhere you go check your own shoes first before jumping the gun and blaming everyone but yourself.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Arcanopulse","date":"2015-01-26T04:28:54.003+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Jinuku,realm=OCE,application-id=Ntey9fRZ,discussion-id=I7faPlz5,comment-id=,timestamp=2015-01-26T04:05:08.121+0000)\n\n> \n> Every game i'm about to start i'm expecting to lose, it doesn't matter what lane or role i play.\n\nEnd of thread.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Hirudora","date":"2015-01-31T04:50:40.564+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"I hope i'm not the only one but does anyone have bad luck with duo bot players, i mean over the years i'v had a lot of duo bot matches, not me other people and i always get the fail duo bots everytime.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Hirudora","date":"2015-01-31T02:03:47.486+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Would you believe it hahahaha, i won my first match today, that is five games 1 win. \nI was GangPlank Support, hey they had Azir support so i was like F it i'll go someone with decent poke and has heals and our bot lane owned.\nSo funny clicking on GP for the first time in like two years or so his voice just cracked me up lmao","replies":[]}]}
