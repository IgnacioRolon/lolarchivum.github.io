Orders are not processed after business hours or on weekends. Any orders placed during this time will be processed on the next business day. Please allow up to 24 hours for online updates. If a significant amount of time has passed and you have not received a tracking number yet, please Contact Us.\n\nShipping Cost: Your shipping cost is generally determined by the weight of the item(s) and the shipping address. As a service to customers, we offer flat-rate shipping in many countries. Your final shipping cost can be calculated from the Shopping Cart and will be displayed during Checkout.  Residents in certain countries may also have tax and duty applied to their shipment per their country's import laws.\n\nPackaging: Most products will ship in a durable cardboard box. Clothing items are typically packaged within an additional polybag for protection. Art and posters are rolled and shipped in a sturdy poster tube.\n\nMultiple Shipments: You may have ordered items that could not be packaged together (i.e. Clothing and Art), and therefore had to be shipped separately. If all shipments have not arrived within the estimated delivery times, please Contact Us.\n\n\nI guess 3 days to ship and 9 days to land.\n\n1st I'm like this{{summoner:6}}  then im like{{summoner:3}}","replies":[{"poster":"Cabbage Girl","date":"2017-11-12T03:00:58.965+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thank you very much!
