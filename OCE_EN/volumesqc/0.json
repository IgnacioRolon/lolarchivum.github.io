I feel like I have the potential to be a Gold but it seems so difficult to do more than 2 wins in a row... I&#039;m sure there&#039;s a lot of people with the same struggle!\r\n\r\nI need tips, need advices, need anything you can give me that could help me get out of there! Dropped a link above with my Match History/Info etc...\r\n\r\nTell me guys what I do right and what I do wrong. I want to improve myself a lot this year.\r\n\r\nThanks in advance.\r\n\r\nKind regards, VolumesQC. :)","replies":[{"poster":"Ingénue","date":"2016-04-29T12:18:08.283+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Being the smooth kidlet I am, I managed to get to gold from silver 4 over urf weekend. \nI can give you a couple of tips that helped me ;)\n\n* **One thing I have noticed, is that you are a \"fill\" kind of guy.**\nI totally get it, its fun and you are always kept on your toes. Just like the reason you aren't a Nasus one-trick, you don't want to get stuck playing the same thing over and over again. \nA big issue with this, it that you become a jack of all trades, master of none. There aren't any champs or roles you will know like the back of your hand, which can put a bit of a damper on your ladder climbing. \n\n>Dynamic queue allows you to choose two roles, so you have 100% chance of getting of your fave/best roles. Pick up a few comfort champs in each, learn all there is to know about them so you know things like build paths and matchups like the back of your hand. Fill is your worst enemy. Leave filling roles to normals. If you really want, you can switch your main roles every couple of months so you don't die of repitition. \n\n* **Sometimes your CS is great, other times if leaves a bit to be desired. **\nHappens to all of us, but with a bit of work, your CS can start to become pretty consistent (more cs=more gold= more damage= more wins).\n\n>Here is a specific guide to [CS](http://imgur.com/orWUCKH). While you're at it, why not spend some time to brush up on other important league skills such as:  [warding](http://www.mobafire.com/league-of-legends/build/support-guide-map-control-warding-344910), positioning, [teamcomps](http://www.liquidlegends.net/forum/lol-strategy/476270-picks-and-bans-understanding-team-compositions), and [being a nice person and encouraging your team](http://gameinfo.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/game-info/get-started/summoners-code/). If you need help with some of this, you could[ consider hiring a coach](http://www.lol-coaching.com). \n\n* ** Be super aware of your improvements, strengths and weaknesses by keeping track **\n\n>Most of my improvement comes from my ranked diary. After every game I write down who I was playing, my score, CS, wards placed, LP gained/lost and a quick summary of the game. I also like to write down 3 things I did well, and 3 things I need to improve. That way, you are really processing the game and learning from your mistakes. It also gives you something to consciously work towards improving in the next game. \n\n\nSmaller scale tips:\n\n* Learn when you are tilted. If you notice you aren't having fun/are losing more than winning, take a break. Play a few arams or a completely different game. No use playing ranked when you aren't at your best (I learnt that the hard way)\n* Spam ranked during URF weekends. Games are more challenging and fulfilling due to most casual players playing the urf. \n\nGood luck, may the elo be ever in your favour ♥","replies":[{"poster":"VolumesQC","date":"2016-04-30T05:03:08.850+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It was acutally a nice read.

Its better knowing the people your playing with are good players instead of getting 3-4 bad players and i find it a lot more fun so while you play nasus even if u find playing him is boring you still manage to have more fun with them as you connect and chat with them more each game","replies":[{"poster":"VolumesQC","date":"2016-04-30T19:57:14.089+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You're right. I should do it more often. I do have few friends that I know IRL and they're good but I feel like there's a lack of communication (voice program).
