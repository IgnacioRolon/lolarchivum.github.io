The enemy turret before the inhib was taken down. I had zz'rot placed down beforehand (which is what helped us take the tower but the think is, instead of going for the inhib it went straight for the tower dealing damage to its healthbar. \r\n\r\nWhat im getting at is you can damage the nexus towers without taking down the inhibs.
