If the issue continues, please provide your connection details to me by downloading the [WinMTR Network Diagnostic Tool](http://winmtr.net/download-winmtr/). Use that to run a traceroute to the following IP's (allow this to run for 5-15 minutes);\n\n> 103.240.227.25\n103.240.227.5\n\nExport the results to a text file and paste them here.\n\nLet me know if anything helps.\n-DTN","replies":[{"poster":"JERRAM","date":"2016-02-10T21:09:37.394+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"thanks for the reply i will see if it works.","replies":[]}]}]}
