Granted he had a lot of kills, but that still doesn't mean he should be doing that amount of damage THAT quickly.\nAnd as Nightjar just pointed out below it seems to be a base stat scaling issue that resulted in such stupidity.","replies":[{"poster":"Talon12","date":"2017-03-25T00:59:45.966+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"You specifically said he did 2k PHYSICAL DAMAGE with 1 ad item.  Searching your history, it was a game vs Alex Li. He had a SHEEN and a BORK. Your items were literally nothing but mr and hp, which does nothing versus armor (again state you are an idiot for complaining about ad when you have nothing but mr.) \n\n\nIf he was at level 18 and full build he has 162.05 ad (unless had fire drake, but as that is not specified by the riot API it is assumed not)\nYou were level 17, with extremely dodgy runes, containing no bonus hp or armor, with merc treads, warrior enchantment, visage, black cleaver and titanic hydra.\n\nHe had a sheen which made his damage jump to 271.05 physical damage on the first hit. Your runes have 0 bonus armor, so your armor was sitting at 80.9 which his her base, granting a damage resistance (using the rule 100/100+x) your resistance is only 44.7% damage reduction.  From your items you had 3269 HP, which means bork did an additional 261.52 damage, totalling the first hit's physical damage at 532.57(without reduction), as such the damage dealt would only be 238.0588, as such the second attack would not have the advantage of full bork damage or sheen, therefore only doing 180.823, the next hit even less as his aa speed is 1.2, meaning he gets off 2 attacks per second, meaning the third attack would only do 174.357, meaning after approximately 1.5 seconds had passed he has done a grand total of 593.2388, if this is true, it would have taken him approximately 5.23 seconds to kill you if he used his other spells for the sheen active (on point as soon as sheen was off cd, without landing those spells, as you said only physical), or 6.79 through the first use of sheen and no more thereafter.\n\nThis \"fizz\" \"one hitting you\" has only been in one of your last 60 matches, he was fed, and you had a brilliant idea to build no armor whatsoever, relying solely on your base armor, then complain about him doing a lot of physical damage. \n\nYou cant come and complain about him being strong because you are stupid, the math punches that in your face, he cannot even do 600 damage in 3 attack, even with the sheen effect and 10% hp effect of bork, which means ever hit after the first does less and less. That wasn't even counting the fact you get a shield to absorb a lot of that damage as well. \n\nSo quit complaining, you were proven wrong.","replies":[{"poster":"Nightjar","date":"2017-03-31T00:23:38.739+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"you have to realise that when people make these posts, they are of course including some embelishment, more likely he means 2k damage total, not just pure ad, or maybe he didn't check his death recap. \n\nWhen I posted I was talking about how tank fizz can do alot of hybrid damage from his base stats and I didn't really read the posts. Upvote for the math though man, I love when people use math in their arguements. Tank Fizz is much more manageable right now, but I don't like assassins building tank (though I do this quite often).\n\nThe 700burst with no ap, was likely due to the iceborn proc, seastone magic damage trigger and bork active, but 2k damage is something that would generally occur over about 6-8s, and it would be hybrid damage including his ult, not pure ad.","replies":[{"poster":"Talon12","date":"2017-03-31T09:39:57.494+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"He was very adamant on it being 2k physical.","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Nightjar","date":"2017-03-24T13:53:29.970+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"except he's sticky and tanky and the build gives him full cdr pretty early on, so he just sticks to you and kills you in around 2-3s if you are squishy and 8-14s if you are a full hp tank.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Nightjar","date":"2017-03-24T10:54:35.454+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"he still does magic damage though. The problem is fizz's base numbers are designed as a catchup mechanic, but realistically he can build tank and still use those catchup numbers. It's the assassin dilemma that has plauged riot's balancing board for the last few seasons, an assassin should be strong when ahead, but often since assassins are snowbally, they can fall behind and riot doesn't want the assassin to be a burden when behind. Hence they give assassins higher base numbers than alot of comparable mages. \n\nHowever this creates a problem when assassins build tank, so that they can use the base numbers to do damage and still be tanky.\n\nThat's why things like full tank shaco, tank yasou, sunfire tank akali, tank ekko, and full tank fizz are or have been huge problems at various points in the game's history.\n\nThere are ways to counter assassins building tank, but the issue is that when it's viable and the base numbers are sufficient, it's really easy to play, powerful and alot more reliable, and it is such cancer to play against if your team isn't well coordinated.","replies":[{"poster":"Talon12","date":"2017-03-24T11:02:08.708+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Problem wasnt that yasuo was tanky, it was frozen mallet made him so damn sticky so he could chunck out tanks while still giving him enough damage to kill squishies quickly.

It's the most cancerous thing in the world, especially if your backline isn't very mobile. There are a number of reasons this works, mainly the stealth, the ult's flexibility and execute damage. It's not as good as triforce lethality right now, but it's actually pretty strong if you know how to play it.\n\nTank shaco should not be allowed to exist, but it's actually pretty decent, especially in low elo.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}
