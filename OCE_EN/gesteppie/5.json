An engage champoin, but not. A damage soaker, but way too squishy for it.\r\nI can&#039;t seem to find the right build for him and he is incredibly reliant on your teamates not legging it in teamfights.\r\n\r\nIt just feels like hes missing something?","replies":[{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2017-04-22T15:22:39.231+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I mean, I can't speak to anyone else, but I've had a lot of success with him (mostly with Xayah ADC ofc but also with Vayne, Jinx and Cait so far).\n\nHe's one of those champions that has versatility over focus. Instead of being really good at one thing, he's decent at a lot of things. He has a hard engage, and the escape power to cover his relative squishyness. He has mad peel for his ADC as well as some sustain to keep them alive. If I had to give his playstyle a name it's distraction. He's great at baiting, because you can make them think you are overextending, when really you are just setting up for your ADC, though this is ofc a lot easier with a Xayah because of the E range.\n\nNow obviously this is only how I've been playing him, but here you go:\n\n___\n##Skills:\nQ > W > E > Max E > Max W > Max Q\n\nLevelling Q doesn't increase the heal, and he really doesn't get any damage on it so it's not worth levelling. You could Max the W first if you wished, It reduces the CD and does have decent damage, but I'd really stick to E. It's pretty much the core of his kit since it's his way in and out of fights as well as most of his utility.\n\n___\n##Runes/Masteries:\nhttp://i.imgur.com/LPLjmvu.png?noredirect\n\nhttp://i.imgur.com/n8ICU4x.png?noredirect\n\nI don't by any means think my Runes/Materies are good. I don't have anywhere close to all the runes so I'm just using one of my standard and pretty damn average support pages that hasn't changed in a year. It's not something I care enough about to really tryhard it, but t works well enough for me. Same goes for Masteries really, it works well enough that I haven't been bothered to change it.\n\n##Items:\n{{item:3301}} {{item:3340}} {{item:2010}} x3 > {{item:2049}} + {{item:3096}}  > {{item:3069}} + {{item:3047}} or {{item:3111}} > {{item:3107}} > {{item:3109}} OR {{item:3190}} (vs AD or vs AP) > Whatever other tanky items are appropriate. Honestly most of my games ended before or just after I finished Redemption.\n\nBasically, tank utility items.\n\n___\n##Playstyle: \nQ first, play it safe at lvl 1 and leave poking to your ADC. If the enemy comes in for poke, Q them and pass the health to your carry. It doesn't cost that much mana so as long as your ADC isn't too reckless you'll pretty much negate anything the enemy does. Biggest thing to remember is that he is not a poke champion. The Q does next to no damage so really should only be used for sustain.\n\nW second, if your ADC has some form of CC (Xayah Q>E, Jinx E, Cait W etc) then you can honestly kill here, or at least blow multiple summs. W in, ADC gets their CC, Q cc'ed enemy then run back to your ADC to pass them the heal. Having your passive up when you do this is a big bonus. If your ADC doesn't have CC, then I'd recommend just saving it as a defensive disengage or counter-engage.\n\nE third. This is when things really kick off. There are two big combos here. W to engage > Q to grab the heal > E to disengage + protect your ADC > E again (ideally after the first shield has been used up) all while your ADC is pumping out damage. The other is E to position > W to engage > Q > E. The E is a real fast reposition so if your ADC is close enough it's a great way to surprise your enemies with the W.\n\nOnce you get your Ult the combos are the same just chuck your R in before the second E. R > W is great too if you are close enough cause it means they can't escape the knockup by flashing or dashing etc, but it does mean you lose duration on your already pretty short ult to use on others. The R > W is a strong combo but you shouldn't use it if you need the R for their whole team as opposed to one or two grouped enemies.\n\nThe E CD especially is fair short, and you'll rack up CDR pretty quick too, so you can be jumping in and out of fights a lot. The biggest thing is to watch for enemy CC. If you know they're going to blow CC on you then you shouldn't be engaging if you aren't close to full. Compared to other tanks you are quite squishy, and once your in CC will keep you in so you really have to be aware of what they have available. Second or third W in fights I'd typically save as defensive but if the fight is obviously in your favour then you may as well be aggressive.\n\nIt's also worth noting that he's very good at tower diving, since he has an easy and quick way out.\n___\n##Final Notes:\nHe's not a support that's for everyone. He has less damage than even utility heavy/damage light supports like Nami or Braum, hell, even a Raka would probs beat him in damage. He's very reliant on his team. He's actually a pretty decent top in my experience but he's reliant on the jungler being at least a little present, and has almost no kill potential on his own.\n\nHe can be very very strong, and can carry even a very average ADC if played right, even more so than Nami, which is high praise from me because I've carried some pretty dodgy ADCs as Nami. That said, obviously being so reliant on his team means he's pretty much useless on his own, though as support you shouldn't really be on your own anyway.\n\nIf you favour heavy tank supps like Leona/Braum or heavy damage supports like Lux/Zyra then he may well not be for you, but if you enjoy heavy utility supps like Nami/Lulu then you'll ikely enjoy him a lot once you get the hang of him.\n\nBoth Xayah and Rakan have the smoothest animations and combos of any champion I've played to date, and they're a real pleasure to play (even though I am a trash tier ADC). But, all things considered, I enjoyed Rakan fromt he very first game I played him, so if you aren't feeling it, maybe he's just not for you.","replies":[{"poster":"Gesteppie","date":"2017-04-22T20:26:00.513+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Holy Moly that was helpful! ^_^ I'll try playing more you're way, as yes I do love utility champions :)\nI really do love what Rakan can do, but I guess I'm just used to being a little more damage when needed rather than just hopping about like a delicious looking chocolate bunny >_<","replies":[{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2017-04-23T05:36:52.172+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":":) Glad I could be helpful!

Forget the positive comments, the inside word is that he is getting significant buffs.\nCompare to Nautilus, same level of peel/cc yet half as tanky and actually does about half as much damage. Really pitiful champ right now except he is fun to play.\nOh and his heal is less than Nautiluses too as he is a ranged support and cannot use relic shield","replies":[{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2017-04-28T11:06:50.645+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Having played Nautilus support, I would not call Rakan underpowered, especially compared to Nautilus. Nautilus' knockup is far less likely to hit more than one person, and is much easier to avoid. Nautilus also has a fraction of Rakan's mobility (provided there is an ally nearby) which is Rakan's substitute for the tankiness Nautilus has.\n\nRakan's set ups and disengages are incredibly strong, and unlike most other supports (especially tank supports) don't really put him at much risk comparatively. His cds are also short enough that if the enemy insists on chasing he can just disengage again.\n\nHe is extremely effective in the assassin/dive/gap closer heavy comps of today, where other tank supports like Nautilus struggle to provide the same degree of distraction that he does.\n\nDo I think he could be stronger? Sure, especially as people learn to play against him more, maybe a small damage buff (at least on his Q, you really can't poke at all in lane) and maybe a small health buff (not resistances, those are in a pretty good place with his build paths imo), but realistically I think he's in a pretty good spot. I don't think I've actually lost more than one or two lanes with him yet.","replies":[{"poster":"Belrick","date":"2017-04-29T10:11:09.959+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Nice comment.\n$10 says im right and you are wrong though.

Rakan's got some learning curve to him, and when he screws up it's painful and obvious, which means he can look weak. We've seen him be really effective as well though when played well, so if anything would be more cautious of him being too strong than weak. We'll see where they sit after mid-season lands.\n\nhttps://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/developer-corner/Bq7mzELo-quick-gameplay-thoughts-april-28?comment=00110000","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Nijel","date":"2017-04-28T16:33:02.803+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yesterday I managed to play Rakan for the first time (because he was either banned or I forgot) and I've got to say he's really refreshing. \n\nTo seemingly go off on a tangent, for some reason I recently ended up reaching Mastery 7 with Alistair. Even though I've been a long time Ali player I've felt he's been missing something for a while, even with his abilities being somewhat rearranged patches ago. Now that I've played Rakan, I now realise that Ali is missing a _whole lot_ of something.\n\nIt's from this perspective that I appreciate what Rakan brings to the table.\n\nRakan has range (a wonky 300, but it's better than being melee right now). Rakan has an aoe knock up but he also has a way to get out, besides _and_ in addition to flash. He offers a heal _and_ a shield. His ult gives him mobility _and_ a brief moment where he might as well be near invincible. Most of all, Rakan feels like he has depth, that there are ways I am able express myself that's different to someone else.\n\nEven though he's got a lot of utility, I play Rakan as a \"tank\". I mean, **Stoneborn Pact** going through every Armour and Magic Resist option. Armour reds, Magic Resist blues, Health and Health per level yellows, and Cooldown quints. My build starts Ancient Coin then goes through Eye of the Oasis to Redemption and Locket. It's really fun.
