Not just from OCE, or NA, but EVERYWHERE. Even customs!\r\n\r\nSo, due to Rito&#039;s own lack of maintenance, support and basic needs for the gamemode, they&#039;re just ditching it?\r\n\r\nYou can give whatever excuse you want about it, lack of resources, not viable, not enough players, yadda yadda yadda, but truth is, players from every region have voiced their concern, displeasure, and even rage about the death of this gamemode. \r\nSo where&#039;s the real justification?\r\n\r\nGive it to us simple Rito; you wanna cut the strings and focus on Summoners Rift. Because that&#039;s where the LCS (money) is.\r\n\r\nDon&#039;t bs and bm us anymore Rito. You&#039;re player base is not appreciative of it.","replies":[]}
