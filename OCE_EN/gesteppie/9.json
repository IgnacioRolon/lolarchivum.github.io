I know he sits under the mage/ tank role, but there are plenty of tanks out there that can cast more than 2 spells without going oom on lvl 2. lvl 3 its worse, coz you gotta wait for your mana to regen before you can cast off the third and potentially a fourth spell. But this leads to you needing incredible timing skills, which are very unforgiving if you dont play it right.\r\n\r\nAnyway, the main thing is, you either have to play Galio as a full ap mage, to get the mana regen and pool you require to do the damage. Or go a badass body blocker and hope your teamates can survive with just your q w e combo, coz you aint gunna have enough for that ult.\r\n\r\nFood for thought. Also why is he still a 4800 champ?","replies":[{"poster":"Plasmarine","date":"2016-09-03T15:15:53.420+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Great news is he is getting reworked!! It has been confirmed\nBad news is it won't be until next season at the earliest.\n\nI agree 100% though. Love Galio, but I have only played him on the rift a few times. Stopped for a few reasons\n\n1. Mana issues are seriously ridiculous (Missing a Q+E Combo made me want to kms cause it almost always sent me OOM)\n2. AD Mids also became insanely popular\n3. Grail change. He doesn't benefit from the passive being able to -shield- an ally his W doesn't actually count as a shield. (I understand this, since it doesn't block damage it's more of a buff to defenses but it's still upsetting). Grail was absolutely perfect and core on him before {{item:3070}} \n\nIn the change I really hope they add a small shield to his W. I would 100% main Galio Support then with a Grail + Windspeakers if they did\n\nStill my fave champ to get in ARAM + play in URF though <3","replies":[{"poster":"Gesteppie","date":"2016-09-05T03:38:03.842+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"him in URF XD = unstoppable XD\n\nif only you could spam that sheild in regular games :P","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Talon12","date":"2016-09-03T17:34:49.423+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"\"great kit, nice bits of damage, so much potential for counter plays\"\n\nHe is soon on the rework list because his kit is bad.","replies":[{"poster":"Gesteppie","date":"2016-09-05T03:37:28.751+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"His kit isnt bad, just the fact Rito hasn't been paying attention to his balancing.\n\nIf he had proper mana and ap scaling, he'd be a viable champ, but they didn't, so he isnt.","replies":[{"poster":"Talon12","date":"2016-09-05T09:16:42.712+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Gesteppie,realm=OCE,application-id=FjGAIbRv,discussion-id=ttxOEoBV,comment-id=00050000,timestamp=2016-09-05T03:37:28.751+0000)\n>\n> His kit isnt bad, just the fact Rito hasn&#x27;t been paying attention to his balancing.\n> \n> If he had proper mana and ap scaling, he&#x27;d be a viable champ, but they didn&#x27;t, so he isnt.\n\nhis q offers literally nothing but point and double click damage. His e is meh, low damage and a little movespeed. His passive. most teams dont have enough agic damage to warrant more than 1 magic resist item.

Just Rito hasnn't been balancing anything about him, hence his uselessness. there are plenty of other champs in the league with point and click damage abilities, but they've been scaled appropriately, because people play them more often.
