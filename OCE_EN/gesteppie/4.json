Long gone is the easiness of jungle play though. Long gone are green wards and the ability to buy as many items that stack as you want because of the new caps.\r\nI admit the new system makes it tighter and cleaner; much harder for people to do trolling things, BUT it&#039;s sapping the fun.\r\nYou can&#039;t play champs in other roles anymore unless you know exactly what you&#039;re doing. So unless you&#039;ve been practicing, say, an ADC support champ which is originally intended to be AP for a long while, you wouldn&#039;t have much hope of pulling it off in the new seasons.\r\nEverything is becoming too rigid, and subsequently, too boring because of this competitiveness!\r\n\r\nThink of it, how many times in Season 5 and this preseason have you tried a completely different build on your favourite champion and have it worked, and used it more than once? Such as an AP playing AD and vise versa.\r\n\r\nThat&#039;s what I miss about the earlier seasons, the flexibility of it and the fun. I like to think of seasons 2 and 3 were like a jumping castle, fun and easy to muck around without anyone being tragically hurt. But seasons 5 til now, more like just a castle; impressive and fortified, but no fun with those cold stone walls.\r\n\r\nWhat are your thoughts? Are you suffering from the &quot;balancing&quot; (rigidity) of League these days? Or are you happy with where Leagues ideology is going?","replies":[{"poster":"chezwickcheese","date":"2016-01-10T07:19:38.851+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"You're spot on with everything you've said. I really wish we could go back a few major patches. There is definitely less diversity in the game at the moment even though we have a massive champion pool and items to choose from not to mention completely new masteries which feel way too constricted (thunderlords or don't bother). I praying something can be done to return this game to its former glory where playing was a fun experience.","replies":[{"poster":"Gesteppie","date":"2016-01-14T09:54:43.484+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yea I agree. Maybe if they made a separate client for the original game for those of us who actually want to play league for fun purposes instead of putting Victory numbers beside our names :)","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Narvuntien","date":"2016-01-18T11:32:54.587+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I think the difference is that you have gone up in MMR even in normals. Put simipily you are better at the game your opponents are better at the game. So unless you play your best you'll lose. \n\nI cannot play any bruiser champions, I am pretty much useless at top lane but I can't even try to learn to play them without feeding because it is calibrated to my best games. \n\nthe only soultion I know is to make a smurf account and dick about again, you'll see it's just like it used to be... no runes no masteries no rules.\n\nalso playing with premades is where you want to play your cheese comps and silly builds. I was just playing AP kog failed horribly, I have been playing it with friends and was doing great.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Er√∏se","date":"2016-01-10T02:33:41.033+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"It would be good if a rioter actually replied to this.
