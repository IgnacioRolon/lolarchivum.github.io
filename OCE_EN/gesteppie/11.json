NOT FUN.\r\nProblem is I have no idea how to fix it.\r\nI&#039;ve done everything on the League troubleshooting site, I have set my &quot;priority&quot; for the process up to high, I am running off SSD for the game. So what has happened?\r\nI have no fps issues in any other games I have, so it seems to just be a league problem. I don&#039;t want to miss out for the ARURF weekend. \r\nI would like to use reinstalling league as a last resort preferably.\r\n\r\nAny help is appreciated!","replies":[{"poster":"         Swhyper","date":"2017-08-12T10:42:24.035+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Windows 10’s Game DVR feature can slow your gaming performance by recording video in the background. If you don’t care about recording your gameplay, disable Game DVR for performance reasons.\n\nUnfortunately, Game DVR takes system resources. On a slower computer–or if you just want maximum graphical horsepower for your games–it can noticeably slow your in-game performance and lower your FPS. If you don’t care about recording your gameplay, you’ll want to disable this feature. This Game DVR feature may or may not be enabled by default, depending on your PC’s hardware.\n\nPlease disable both Game DVR and Game Bar.\n\nTo disable Game DVR, head to Settings > Gaming > Game DVR. Ensure the “Record in the background while I’m playing a game” option here is set to “Off”.\n\nTo disable the Game Bar, head to Settings > Gaming > Game Bar. Set the “Record game clips, screenshots, and broadcast using Game bar” option here to “Off”.\n\nHope this helped :D.","replies":[{"poster":"Gesteppie","date":"2017-08-13T22:39:50.525+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I feel a bit silly now, I should have posted some specs with it xD\n\nI'm on Windows 7 64bit professional\nNvidia 660 graphics card\nSSD boot drive.\n16GB ddr3 RAM\n\nI fiddled with Nvidia settings to the extent I had to remove the drivers and clean install them x)\n\nThe only thing that seems to \"resolve\" (i say this because it doesnt actually fix the underlying issue) is to remove the framerate cap, let it go up to 200+ fps, then watch as it jumps down to 80-100fps.\n\nEDIT: I turned the \"arcade mode\" visuals off, and it has restored about 20 of my fps. I'm still getting the inconsistency though.

No worries, I am here to help you. Can I ask if you could go on your task manager (cntrl + alt + del) and tell me what is running in the process tab? \n\nAlso, can you please try and right click on your League Of Legends and ensure that full screen optimisation is disabled.\n\nCheers\nSwhyper","replies":[{"poster":"Gesteppie","date":"2017-08-29T00:55:53.145+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I've switched up to a gtx  670. \nI'm still getting the same problems but my uncapped frame rate is high enough so when it dives down it isnt as big a problem.\nI think it might have something to do with arcade mode as i have never had this bad an issue with frame drops before in league.\n\nI'm very tedious when installing new things on my computer and very aware of new things that should not be running, so don't worry, there is no malicious programs running in the background.\n\nI must ask though, where do i find the \"full screen optimisation\" option? because its not in any right click menus.","replies":[{"poster":"         Swhyper","date":"2017-09-06T00:56:29.547+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey,\n\nSorry for the late reply.
