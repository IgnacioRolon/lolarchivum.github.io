That said, some arguments for both sides are valid. Since most of vocal people in this thread are against the changes, I'll start with what was enjoyable about the new Quinn.\n\nPositives of the New Quinn\n\nOne of the most surprising things about playing the new Quinn was how much her strengths have changed. Before the rework, Quinn and Valor were extremely different from other ADCs: Quinn had a strong early game, not only for an adc but as a champion in general (given her E, massive harrier damage, and blind), had qualities of other roles (assassination and split-push potential with ult, dueling potential with blind), and lacked qualities of traditional ADCs (steered away from the typical early-game punching bag to late-game, team-fighting, dps machine power curve).\n\nThe Quinn rework fixes this alleged \"identity crisis\" by successfully molding Quinn and Valor into a more stereotypical ad carry. The scaling on her passive, CD refund and execution damage on Q, and removal of Valor as a fighting utility shifts Quinn into a clearly defined role: a roaming ranged carry, which is exactly Riot appears to have set out to do.\n\nUpon testing, I noticed her passive becomes vitally significant in the late game especially. Harrier does decent amounts of damage (still obviously less than it used to), but given that her Q applies her passive, she can proc it several times in a row, leading to massive amounts of dps. Quinn still retains most of her ability to chase down targets, but now has a greater emphasis on wearing down targets with multiple autos in quick succession rather than huge burst. Her changes to her passive and Q create a nice and new feeling to Quinn's late game. If I were to try to describe it in words, she just flows so much more now, and everything feels very smooth.\n\nThe changes create a power curve for Quinn similar to other ADCs in that she is generally weak early game with Q and harrier doing little damage, but by late game (especially with a lead) her constant passive procs and Qs equate to a load of damage and plays like most other AD Carries.\n\nThe rework is bearable and actually pretty fun to play, but has it's own problems as shown below.\n\nSo What's Wrong with the New Quinn?\n\nLet's start from the view of the Quinn mains, or more accurately, the Quinn and Valor mains.\n\nBack before Quinn was fully released, when IronStylus was asked about how \"satisfying\" Quinn's auto's are, he replied:\n\n\"I find her auto attacks EXTREMELY satisfying. Some of that is animations and VFX, other parts of it are sound, crisp and snappy, and the other part, the novel part, is the special sauce that's a cornerstone of her auto attacks.\"\n\nAs a Quinn and Valor main, I couldn't agree more. Not only do Quinn's autos have a \"crisp and snappy\" feel, but most of her kit does on live right now. The sharp sound of a crit or proc-ing harrier, the snap-back sound effect of her E, and her Q all have a feel similar to paper or a wing being flapped sharply in the air. Add on a shiv-proc or Skystrike, and you have an attack that not only feels strong and sharp, but has the damage to back it up.\n\nThis is where the problems start with the \"new Quinn.\" There's something inherently satisfying about extending and finally proc-ing harrier and watching your target's health get nuked by a strong auto, similar to the sound of Vayne's W. That upfront damage feeling makes harrier \"feel\" important, so when Valor marks your next target, it really prompts you to extend for it, leading to meaningful decision-making. Unfortunately, this feeling is something that the new Quinn rework lacks. Both harrier and Quinn's Q fail to provide any significant damage when trading in lane, leading to a very wishy-washy and weak feeling. In fact, this Quinn feels similar to Talon right now in that until at least mid-game, you feel useless. It isn't until late game that your Q damage makes using the CD refund actually feel worth it (clearing with Q in lane just leads to Quinn being oom), and harrier starts really hurting. Even then though, harrier's damage doesn't seem to compare with how it does per hit on live right now, which makes sense. This unfortunately has the affect of making Quinn's gameplay feel too stoic and smooth compared to her sharp, bursty feel on live right now.\n\nThis, combined with a lack of Skystrike damage and diving potential that ult used to provide, makes playing Quinn pretty boring by contrast, and dreadfully so in the early-to-mid game. You're not really doing anything but trying to last hit and avoid trading for at least the first 10 minutes of the game, and having an ult that doesn't deal damage isn't helpful at all. Removing the blind from Q also removes the necessary protection Quinn needs to safely engage and disengage in trading.\n\nQuinn also still suffers from terrible range for an ADC, resulting in very sub-par team-fighting, in which to proc any of your marks you must overextend, often leading to your death. Your main focus switches to isolating targets and wittling them down before you finish them off with Q, again a very gradual process lacking any crisp feeling until the execution with Q. This gradual feeling may just be common between ADCs, but that doesn't change that Quinn used to have a more enjoyable play-pattern.\n\nThis leads me to my final point, addressing the ult changes. Oh boy.\n\nFirst of all, it's important to understand that Quinn's ultimate is important not JUST from a gameplay perspective, but also from a lore and thematic perspective. There's been a lot of talk about that already, but I'll summarize my feelings here.\n\nOn release, Quinn was named Quinn & Valor in game and in the loading screen (this is obviously where my name comes from). This had huge implications, as it was the first time a champion had ever had two names within the chat and loading border. This had the effect of really depicting the two as a team: Valor was just as important to the champion as Quinn was, and the two were a team that worked together. For what I remember being an issue with name length or spaces, this was eventually shortened in game to just \"Quinn,\" which took a lot away from the champion and was an unfortunate change.\n\nThis aspect of a \"two-for-one\" champion is what made Quinn and Valor unique and fun for many (me included). Their original kit was perfect at portraying this, and it was amazing how much playing as Valor felt like playing as an eagle: you became a swift predator. Carries would do anything they could to get away from Valor, and using E to swoop down on them before Qing and using Skystrike to claim your prey feels simply amazing. Even if you were using the ult for other purposes, such as the out-of-combat movement speed or attack speed increase, you still felt like you were flying. Valor's auto attack animations are some of the most fascinating in the game to me, and I'm sure I'm not alone when I say the thought of never seeing them again is saddening. The entirety of Valor's kit kept this crisp feeling from before too: the sharp dash from E, the sound of Valor's autos, Skystrike itself - everything felt powerful.\n\nThe fact that the new kit throws all of this to the wind in favor of . . . more mobility(?) is really sad, as it portrays Valor as more of a tool than a half of the champion.\n\nTaking away Quinn's blind and early game damage completely change her style of play. In many ways, taking away the blind feels more like a lazy solution to a sometimes-buggy ability, and limits Quinn's potential for meaningful decision-making greatly. The difference in timing when using the blind could make or break a Quinn player, and if you used it when you didn't need to and the enemy flashed away, you then had little take them down with from a range. That said, taking away the blind, while worrying and disheartening, is bearable (rip \"Gouge'm Valor\" though). Throwing Valor to the wind (heh) is not though.\n\nQuinn's ult is what defined her, and gave her a great amount of opportunities to cope with bad team-fighting. The ult was one of the most meaningful decisions of all: using it too early ended up in wasting it. Using it to escape a fight meant not having it for an assassination, split-push, or escape later. Committing and using ult for an assassination left Quinn and Valor with little for an escape. Tag Team was great, and it's use defined a Quinn player. Now instead, players don't have that decision to make, as there is little cost for using an ult, and it's pretty obvious when you should: are you gonna be walking for awhile? Press R. Tag Team originally provided more-or-less the same mobility, but came at a meaningful cost and was FUN to use and helped give a thematic foundation to a great champion.\n\nIn Conclusion\n\nDoes this rework give Quinn an isolated identity as a roaming ADC? Yes\nIs that identity preferable to Quinn's previous state? Possibly?\nIs this reworked Quinn more unique and fun to play than the old Quinn? NO. NOT BY A LONG SHOT.\n\nThis rework changes a lot of what people loved about Quinn. While some of the changes are understandable, completely redefining half of a champion into a tool is saddening, and the rework greatly limits meaningful decision making and makes playing Quinn a long and repetitive (almost autopilot) process of procing your passive and pressing R to reposition so you can proc your passive some more. Ultimately the new Quinn feels less unique and closer to a blander cookie-cutter ADC.\n\nEdit: Here's some food for thought: \"In terms of Quinn, I'd probably really re-explore why she has to be an ADC. I'm not sure we fully explored the melee version with enough rigor or time. I'd love to break her back down, find that core fundamental and build upon that.\" - IronStylus\"","replies":[]},{"poster":"Nijel","date":"2015-10-30T01:44:54.336+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I think Quinn having a blind is the same as Kassadin having a silence.

Picking her Top or Bottom has slightly less value (now) than picking her Mid, and I would argue that removing her blind actually decreases her ability to be picked in _all_match ups - at least before you could blind AA reliant champions, or decrease ranged harass. I'd imagine that she would remain a situational pick mid lane, anything more would be too difficult to say without experience playing her on PBE. I'd be most interested in seeing how well she roams with the ultimate changes (such as no execute or Q/E/AA pulling you out of your ultimate).","replies":[{"poster":"Nijel","date":"2015-10-30T05:41:51.615+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":">I still think Riot might be overly optimistic if they expect people to successfully blind pick Quinn. \n\nThat's not Riot's thinking, it's mine. No champ is designed to be blind picked but some can because they have safe laning and farming (like GP). Obviously we don't know how mana reliant she is, so who knows.\n\n>Picking her Top or Bottom has slightly less value (now) than picking her Mid, and I would argue that removing her blind actually decreases her ability to be picked in _all_ match ups - at least before you could blind AA reliant champions, or decrease ranged harass.\n\nI disagree. The blind has been best against melee ads who she can reliably land the blind on. In other lanes it has little use really, especially when ap or ability reliant. Can't really say a blind makes it safer for her to farm compared to the new q in most lanes.\n\nShe's getting so much in return though. She can land harrier, q a champ and kill a minion to reset, harrier again, q again, harrier etc etc. It has the possibility to be so strong especially when you consider q will hit harder the lower the enemy gets and apply vulnerable every single time alongside the normal cd.\n\n>be most interested in seeing how well she roams with the ultimate changes (such as no execute or Q/E/AA pulling you out of your ultimate).\n\nWe still need to see how much more damage the q does but it's her new execute. Also, she won't be going melee anymore so I think you just arrive in lane and start fighting.","replies":[{"poster":"Gesteppie","date":"2015-10-30T09:37:37.836+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I reckon they should have focused further in on her melee side.\n\nInstead of conforming her to a \"marksman\" role they could have even made her more viable as a jungler.

What they're doing is entirely turning her into a \"traditional\" marksman. Her new q is a damage % scaling ability and she relys little to nothing on her passive. Her Valor form has no skills anymore, which means she no longer has the bruiser/ assassination ability. Her Valor form is purely for movement speed.  Any use of abilities in Valor form immediately revert her back to Quinn form.\nShe has no ability to 1v1 duel anymore due to the harsh removal of her blind and being a champ of already short range, wont be very useful in teamfights; being able to get caught out so easily from having to be so close to the enemy.\nSure her ULTI makes her a viable mid laner, but what adc mains mid lane? Any mid lane adc usually has some sort of AP power they can use so they are so reliant on AA in mid, otherwise its just rush Zhonyas for the enemy mid laner and gg.","replies":[{"poster":"Nijel","date":"2015-11-01T00:02:55.228+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Not sure I actually agree with that.

I'm not making this up, I'm reacting and relaying what I've heard and seen.\n\nWhat I've seen is her go mid or top, with constant commentary of how she has no place bot at all. I've watched her rely constantly on her passive in lane and her ult at all parts of the game post 6 to be relevant. She is primarily a roamer and there's nothing traditional about that. She's unique right now and she's unique after the changes. Maybe not unique in the same ways but unique nonetheless.\n\nSure, she won't be unique by having the choice of being a bruiser or an assassin or duelling 1v1 as well as she could. You will still have other adcs who can do that. Urgot is a bruiser, Twitch is an assassin, Vayne and Tristana can already 1v1 (with morde doing all of these). I would go so far to say the idea of \"traditional marksman\" won't exist after the patch lands. Beyond all going bot lane there will be very little overlap within the role.\n\n>Sure her ULTI makes her a viable mid laner, but what adc mains mid lane? Any mid lane adc usually has some sort of AP power they can use so they are so reliant on AA in mid, otherwise its just rush Zhonyas for the enemy mid laner and gg.\n\nLook, I said mid/top (possibly bot) as a flexible pick. Just because you think no adc mainly goes mid doesn't mean you can confidently rule out the opinion. By that logic, if she ends up going mid won't that make her unique? And again, I never said she would main anything, I commented on her flexibility being more focused and reliable.\n\nI understand that you are referring that the way she will play is like a \"traditional\" adc instead of a form swapper. That's undeniable. I'm saying that she still won't be traditional because she still won't be 100% going bot lane.\n\nI'm tired of discussing Quinn at this point. I'll never convince Quinn fans that the changes might be interesting and I'll keep getting downvoted for what are actually fair and open-minded statements.
