OH YEA BABY!!!!\n\nOnly trouble is, I don&#039;t want to play because I&#039;ve been put off by 1 champion... Fiora.\nLast Year for URF teemo was banned because of his ridiculousness with the shrooms.\nThis year it should be Fiora. Her ease of parry, catching up and doing TONNES of true damage in less than 3 hits AND gaining a massive heal less than every 20 seconds is also ridiculous!\nIt&#039;s almost impossible to kill her unless you&#039;ve got the right champs to 5 man her, so it&#039;s a basic guarantee win for your team.\n\nWhen every game I&#039;ve played URF every Fiora has gone 20+/10-/?\n\nWell if she doesn&#039;t at least get disabled, there should be a draft mode so people can choose whether or not to get the luck of the draw with the crazy lady or not.","replies":[{"poster":"Seen","date":"2017-03-06T03:04:00.337+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Trynamere AD would work against her.

BUT, Fiora isn't. When she has the ability to block EVERYTHING for a 0.75 time frame every 4 seconds (even Sion's UNSTOPPABLE ult) with 2 dashes every 2 seconds AND a massive heal (even though there is supposed to be healing reduction in AR URF). Most OP champs you can catch out by mashing your keyboard and hoping to hit them whilst SOMETHING of theirs is on CD. You can't with Fiora.\nPLUS Fiora has the true damage so you've limited options in itemisation against her, and in AR URF, when you want to have fun, most will just go full damage.\nI know most will say \"it takes skill to play her\" but after hitting 6, most people would have figured out you can w everything and stomp with her, no matter your skill level >_< especially with everything being so spam-able.","replies":[{"poster":"TM06ASF","date":"2017-03-07T21:01:57.900+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"from what ive head ar urf was riots answer to balancing urf","replies":[{"poster":"Gesteppie","date":"2017-03-08T20:34:13.849+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It wasn't really a \"balancing\" issue, it was more to stop the gm from stagnating with people playing the same 10-15 champs over and over and over again >_<","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}
