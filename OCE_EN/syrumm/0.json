We're not specialists on this, but we'll do our best to help.\n\n_**Here's what I need you to do for me:**_\n\n+ We'll need your ticket number before anything can be done. It should have come with the email Riot sent to you, I believe it's the Request #000000000 number.\n\n+ Think back. \n_Did you let anyone use your account?_ \n_Did you give anyone your password?_\n\nReply to this with the info, and I'll forward it to some Rioters who might be able to give you a hand :D\n\n**One more thing**, did you change your summoner name very recently? What was it before?\n\nAlso, you said you left for holiday on the 2nd of January. Yet we have a game where you played ranked on the 5th of January as **Pantheon**. Were you aware of this game?","replies":[{"poster":"syrumm","date":"2016-03-10T11:09:22.170+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"hey man \n(#20190993)\nthats the ticket number\nand i do not remember that im pretty sure i did not play as pantheon on the 5th of january?  \nand i did download this addon for world of warcraft (that is a mmorpg and you can download addons for it) and i think i got a keylogger maybe? can you check please, last time i played league was like before my holiday... please help me they dont understand that it wasnt me and just keep telling me that it is against the ToS to sell your accout i know that but they dont want to cooperate with me and understand that i may have been framed or something... and on the other hand my world of warcraft account got hacked aswell but i got that back, i told them about the keylogger and i had to change the password for eveything, then i forgot about league of legends and forgot to change the password of that. please help me, ive spent over 500 dollars i think on this account, and no i havent changed my name lately. i repeat i did NOT play on the 5th of january...\nplease reply","replies":[{"poster":"Tele","date":"2016-03-11T04:53:02.620+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"So I had **Riot Maraudaur** look into your ticket for me. He says that Riot support has good evidence to think you're guilty of selling your account. \n\nSadly he can't tell anyone (even me) what that evidence was, since they need to keep their detection methods in some secrecy so that sellers can't avoid them so easily.\n\nI still believe you're an honest guy though, so here's your best shot at getting your account back:\n\n+ Open up a new ticket with Riot support, or follow up with the old ticket. It depends on how constructive or helpful you feel the old ticket was. \n\n Personally I feel opening a new ticket will help your chances a bit ;)\n\n+ Tell them about the keylogger! Bring forth all the evidence you can, tell them about the keylogger and the unauthorized games played on your account (there were 2 BTW, **Ranked Pantheon**, **Normals TF**).\n\n+ Be extremely respectful. No matter what the outcome is, or how it's looking to pan out, you should be really appreciative of them helping you. A little kindness can go a long way.\n\nI hope this helps.","replies":[]}]}]}]}
