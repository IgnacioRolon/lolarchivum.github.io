This has pretty much stumped my attempts on trying to new changes, though I can very occasionally get a game. but that takes a good 10 minutes of constant lobby creation. Wondering if anyone else is having the same issue??","replies":[{"poster":"QAPLA","date":"2017-11-10T21:04:18.091+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Keep clicking it and it'll work eventually.\n\nHalf a dozen tries or more and it'll work.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Deoxyrib0nucleic","date":"2017-11-10T12:13:51.054+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yep, I've been having the same issue!
