I have been waiting for this patch specifically for what seems like a long time. And now that it&#039;s out, I&#039;ve noticed that it hasn&#039;t really &quot;settled&quot; in. The runes are still the same, the new champion and skins aren&#039;t in the shop, and the new items aren&#039;t in the item shop during the game. I&#039;ve never seen a patch like this where it&#039;s there, but not really.\r\nAny thoughts?","replies":[{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2018-05-31T05:14:20.993+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Was NA even patched when you posted this? I was under the impression we (OCE) get the patches pretty much first and NA is closer to last.\n\nIf you just means Pyke and the new skins, they'll likely be activated when the event is rather than straight away.","replies":[]}]}
