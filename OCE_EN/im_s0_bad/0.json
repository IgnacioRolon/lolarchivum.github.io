It is possible that this lag is just a reverberation of that lag through the system.\n\nYou can attempt sending in a support ticket to Riot about this, but they'll probably argue to you that \"it only happens to players who consistently leave games\", so be prepared to deal with that.\n\nIf you want to be more sure that future games you have won't lag out, come by the boards and check to see if anyone's made a recent post about mysterious lag. Could help you avoid some nasty situations.","replies":[]}]}
