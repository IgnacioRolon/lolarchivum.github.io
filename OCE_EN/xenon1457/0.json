For one thing, it means you (more than likely) will get punished, because they *will* report you and that kind of thing (in this case, \"suicide encouragement\") is taken very seriously by Riot, and can often lead to escalation of punishment tiers. Not only that, it gives them the exact response they're looking for, which will only reinforce the behaviour. I know it must suck like hell to risk a ranked game, especially a promo game, because some c*nt is \"holding the team hostage\", but you'd only be making things worse for more players in the long run by \"buying into\" their toxicity, as well as risking your account.\n\nDefinitely report such players in the post-game lobby, and even by submitting a ticket via [Support](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us) if you feel you need to (I'd recommend it), explaining the situation as best you can, and providing screenshots if possible.","replies":[{"poster":"JasonWazza","date":"2017-11-28T11:54:11.696+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":">Not only that, it gives them the exact response they're looking for, which will only reinforce the behaviour.\n\nThe behaviour that Riot doesn't feel the need to stop.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Essembie","date":"2017-12-04T08:32:54.124+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You will get punished for the other person trolling. #Riotplayerbehaviour2k17","replies":[]},{"poster":"Exarch Leona","date":"2017-12-04T07:29:14.824+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Why would it matter if you say that?\nRiot wont care, they support that kinda bull. \n\nI reckon the dude that was gonna afk got freebies and a handy from riot.","replies":[]},{"poster":"CritTheClit","date":"2017-11-28T09:32:44.693+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"that doesnt sound good open a support ticket with support tho if you are worried","replies":[]}]}
