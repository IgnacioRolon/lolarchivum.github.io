I do relatively well, probably around  65%-70% win rate on said champions. I wish to play ranked to better my skills, but i only have 166 normal wins in total playing league. I want to enter ranked in a state where i wont be completely thrashed due to inexperience. \r\n\r\nWhen is the optimal time to enter ranked? A certain amount of champs and rune pages? Or just head straight into it and see what happens?","replies":[]}
