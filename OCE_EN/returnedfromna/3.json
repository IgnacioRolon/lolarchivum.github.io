I've kept the main ingredients for his kit, including:\n\n- Powerball!\n- Returning damage like a living thornmail.\n- The taunt, of course.\n\n***\n\n** - This is just a very basic concept. The figures aren't made fully balanced, it's more about how the kit plays together. Let me know what you think below in the comments. Enjoy! -**\n\n ***\n\n**Innate Passive:** Tremors\n**First Ability:** Powerball\n**Second Ability:** Seismic Slam\n**Third Ability:** Quake\n**Ultimate Ability:** Epicentre\n\nhttps://i.imgur.com/XFn2MOD.jpg[img/] **Innate Passive:** Tremors\n\n- Whenever Rammus is attacked by a large monster, large minion, or enemy champion, he releases a tremor in a 350 Area of Effect around him. Enemies hit by the tremors take **6 (+Champion Level) (+7.5% Armour)** magic damage (Deals 150% damage to Monsters).\n- While Epicentre is active, the range of Tremors extends to 600 Area of Effect.\n\nhttps://i.imgur.com/08eipkt.jpg[img/] **First Ability:** Powerball\n\n- **[First Cast]:** Rammus begins spinning on the spot, becoming unable to move. The range on the second cast ramps up over 2 seconds, and Rammus can hold the first cast for up to 5 seconds. If he is Immobilised by any means, he cancels Powerball and the ability goes on cooldown.\n- **[Second Cast]:** Rammus shoots forward in a straight line, stopping upon colliding with an enemy champion, large monster, or reaching maximum range (600 - 1000 range, depending on time spent channeling). Upon colliding with a target, he strikes all enemies within 175 range of him for 60/90/120/150/180 (+60% Ability Power) magic damage and knocking them up for 0.25 seconds.\n- Rammus can **ricochet** off of walls with Powerball. Each ricochet increases the damage and velocity of Powerball by 35% and increases the total range of the ability by 150. Rammus can ricochet a limitless amount of times, but the damage, velocity, and bonus range only stacks twice per cast.\n- If Rammus ricochets at least once, enemies are knocked outwards 100 range and the knock up is extended to 0.75s.\n- Non-large minions and monsters do not cancel Powerball, but they still take 100% damage.\n- Cooldown: 18/16/14/12/10s.\n- Mana: 60/65/70/75/80 mana.\n\nhttps://i.imgur.com/bCFZwqn.jpg[img/] **Second Ability:** Seismic Slam\n\n- Rammus jumps towards a target point up to 350 range away and slams into the ground, dealing 40/70/100/130/160 (+25% Ability Power, +15% Armour) magic damage to enemies within 275 range of Rammus and slowing them by 60% for 1 second. \n- If Rammus is in Powerball, he jumps forward in a straight line while continuing to Powerball. The range of the jump is increased by 50 (+50 per ricochet, maximum of 500 jump range total). If Rammus lands on an enemy, they are knocked up for 1 second before being slowed by 60% for 1 second. If Rammus directly hits an enemy with a Powerball + Seismic Slam combo, they are instead knocked up then stunned for 1.5 seconds upon landing.\n- Seismic Slam can jump walls, even while Powerballing.\n- Cooldown: 14/13/12/11/10s.\n- Mana: 50 at all ranks.\n\nhttps://i.imgur.com/XFn2MOD.jpg[img/] **Third Ability:** Quake\n\n- Rammus sends out 5/6/7/8/9 Tremors from his passive over 2.5/3.0/3.5/4.0/4.5s, striking enemies within 350 range for **6 (+Champion Level) (+7.5% bonus Armour)** magic damage. The Tremors passive still works while Quake is active.\n- The cooldown of Quake is reduced by 0.5s for each Enemy Champion and Large Monster hit per Tremor.\n- The range of Quake increases to 600 while Epicentre is active, just like Tremors.\n- Cooldown: 20 seconds at all ranks.\n- Mana Cost: 30/35/40/45/50.\n\nhttps://i.imgur.com/bCFZwqn.jpg[img/] **Ultimate Ability:** Epicentre\n\n- Rammus hides in his shell over 0.75s before taunting all enemies within 600 range for up to 2 seconds. Rammus can be interrupted during the casting time, but while the taunt is active he becomes immune to Crowd Control effects and takes 30/45/60% reduced physical damage.\n- Rammus can still cast Quake while Epicentre is active, but casting Powerball, Seismic Slam, Summoner Spells or Item Abilities will cancel Epicentre early.\n- Cooldown: 140/110/80s.\n- Mana Cost: 100 at all ranks.\n\nhttps://i.imgur.com/aBKW0Xt.jpg[img/]\n\n**Thanks for reading!**\n\n- **ReturnedFromNA**","replies":[]}
