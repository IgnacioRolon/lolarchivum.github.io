I am REALLY looking forward to {{champion:51}} and {{champion:145}} arcade skins, those are looking really nice! Even the new champs Arcade skin looks really awesome!\r\n\r\nBut....why...why why why why WHYYYYYYYYYYYYY did out of alllllll the champs in this game....why did YASUO get a battle boss skin?!?!\r\n\r\nDid Karthus not pick up the phone when you called him? Couldn't find Velkoz anywhere?? Was Nunu or kindred or even Swain so undeserving of one of the most visually colorful and aesthetically pleasing looking theme of skins?  \r\n\r\nYasuo already got his attention when you gave him a legendary skin along with that Odyssey themed skin, why is he getting more attention now?? \r\n\r\nThere are soooooo many other champs you could have used like Heimerdinger, you could have made a cool space invaders skin with him. Make his turrets look like the little ships. Give him pixelated missles and grenades\r\n\r\nHeck you know what, lets turn right back around to Vel'koz and Karthus. 2 champs that haven't gotten a skin in 3 YEARS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!\r\n\r\nKarthus' Q and E are very visual spells! It would have been amazing to see him as a battle boss!! His R? Why not like 5 big pixel beams or like laser tag beams?!\r\n\r\nNow let's look at someone like vel'koz. HELLO!!!!! ALL HIS ABILITIES WOULD HAVE BEEN AMAZING AS PIXELATED LASERS AND WHAT NOT!! WHY WOULD YOU SKIP ON THAT!!\r\n\r\nSeriously, all of Yasuo's abilities are so quick and short you don't even get to enjoy the visual's of his abilites, it's not worth 10$.","replies":[{"poster":"Kuzja1","date":"2019-06-21T21:17:31.113+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"They just want to profit out of players who keep using the same champion, over and over and over again.

Vel a little as well.\nNunu and Kindred less so though.\n\nYasuo doesn't really share these traits either in my opinion.\nAnd the skin definitely looks force-fitted.  Their thought process looks like this:\n**[Popular Champ + Popular Skin Line = Money.]**\n\nHowever it has to be mentioned that he is indeed a popular champion, and he's damn cool _(I despise the little sh*t, but even I have to admit that a wandering spell-blade samurai with a dark past isn't at least a little cool.)_  He has a large player base, and thats a lot of players to ignore if you don't give him skins.\n\nAlthough in saying that, like you said, he has received two very solid skins in the relatively recent past.\n\nAre there other champs that are more deserving and fit the theme better? Yes.\nDoes the Yasuo skin detract from the game? No. _(apart from the increased number of Yasuos)_\n\nIt's definitely not the most fitting skin, but theres nothing fundamentally wrong with it.
