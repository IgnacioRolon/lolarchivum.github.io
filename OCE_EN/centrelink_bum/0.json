When i force it to close down, i log back in and I get penalized (it is not 1 hour wait time). This is fucking bullshit as I did not purposely dodge champ select. \r\n\r\nAlso, whenever i finish a match, there would be a maestro error. These problems doesnt happen to my other computer and I have installed and uninstalled and also tried repairing the client and non of it works.","replies":[{"poster":"SephirothSG","date":"2016-07-29T12:03:33.433+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey there,\n\nStill experiencing this issue?","replies":[{"poster":"Centrelink Bum","date":"2016-08-02T01:24:51.218+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"yes i am","replies":[{"poster":"SephirothSG","date":"2016-08-02T07:05:37.553+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Are you launching the client through the patcher?\n\nHave you tried launching the game as Administrator?","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Centrelink Bum","date":"2016-07-29T15:40:19.796+0000","up_votes":0,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey,\n\ni am still experiencing this issue, but i also have other issues in my life which further affects this issue (one being a centrelink bum and unskilled noobs in this game).\n\nanyways, i dont know whats happening. help plz","replies":[]}]}
