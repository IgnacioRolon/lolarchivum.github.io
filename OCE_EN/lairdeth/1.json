Though getting the split gold mid to lategame is really great for rounding off that support build, it's not always the best idea to give this gold to the support rather than say the jungler.","replies":[{"poster":"CHEESYLEEKS","date":"2016-07-19T13:01:29.053+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"yeah its a really flawed system for supports, basically if you take {{item:3301}} or {{item:3303}}  have to get a crazy number of assists, and keep either a perfect kda, or keep 2 or 3 kills above negative ive found , most people just play carry mages and build 1 support item these days anyway. i rarely play against actual supports anymore","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Nightjar","date":"2016-07-19T12:13:58.822+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"As the current system stands, playing selfishly is the easiest method to get an S.\nIf you need that S for hextech boxes or a higher mastery then try your hardest not to die, go back alot, don't try to sacrifice yourself so the adc can get a double or even triple kill. Because in the end of the match if you can keep your deaths to 2 or less and still have over 15 assists+kills you are almost always going to get an S. \n\nFor some reason the system doesn't really weigh objective taking or kill participation as heavily as it should and so basically if you want an easy S as a support you will have to be an *sshole.\n\nThey need to fix it but it's very achievable. Alternatively, if you don't want to be selfish, play a mage support that fights really farback like zilean, zyra or soraka and ward alot.","replies":[]},{"poster":"LlamaLegend","date":"2016-07-17T21:42:40.675+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Since last patch, I have gotten S and S+ On a variety of supports, I see it as warding as much as possible, getting those assists, saving your ADC and team.

I have had the same problem. I have been told that the rating system is that you're game is compared with all the other Soraka games played recently and only the top how ever many % get accredited. I personally don't like the system because it has nothing to do with you're actual game and the stronger meta type picks have to work harder than the not so strong meta picks to get a reward. Anyway what can you do.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Er√∏se","date":"2016-07-20T05:11:36.973+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Riot bases the system on how many soraka supports there are and how good they do.
