When sitting for upwards of 10-15mins waiting for a game, I always play a youtube clip or a flash game on my other monitor waiting, I find that the Length of the Accept Timer and the Volume/Interrupt of the Game found ping is not enough to get back to the game in time. Spending that long only to then be removed from the queue is a MASSIVE pain if I miss the ping, or can&#039;t get back to the Accept button in time.\r\n\r\nCan something be done about increasing the accept timer or is this a previously rejected concept?","replies":[]}
