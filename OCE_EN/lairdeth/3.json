Now, I&#039;m just another Rank 2 with EVERY other player and no-one can tell what kind of player I am.\r\nI am fairly friendly, I try not to get into arguements or feed trolls. I mute instead of fight. I try to be understanding of other people playing poorly.

The fact that it's actually quite hard to get makes it even more meaningful when you finally get it.\n\n__*\n\n> _Yeah, but I have zero feedback, when am I going to get level 3 already?_\n\nI recommend you read **Riot Simurgh**'s [full response](https://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/6kfp1f/i_love_the_new_honor_system_but_i_feel_like_a/djmf3tn/) to this question. But essentially there are two reasons:\n\n+ The system doesn't have a simple leveling system. It's not _\"get X amount of honours for level 3\"_, it's a series of complex algorithms. If Riot gave you a 'progress bar', you would most likely be struggling to understand how it's actually working and why it's increasing or decreasing sometimes.\n\n\n+ The second reason is that they really didn't want the honour system to be an intense grind of collecting tons of honours, but rather a reward which comes one day to honour your good behaviour.\n\nA good analogy for this whole system is the [Silver Star](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silver_Star) medal in the U.S military. \n\nYou don't go asking your General's _\"how many more people do I have to save in combat to get a Silver Star?\"_. Because it's not a linear progression at all, it's up to each General to make a complicated judgement to see if someone deserves it.\n\nAnd you don't \"grind\" to get one either. You just do the best job you can, and at some point you'll be recognised for it.\n&#x2063;\n\n> Other people could see my banner's and tell what kind of player I was. The new system doesn't do this.\n\nThat's true. Now you just have a banner for being level 3+. Players won't know if you are helpful, a team player or just friendly anymore, they just know you're honourable.\n\nHowever, [Riot will be adding a percentage breakdown](https://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/6kfp1f/i_love_the_new_honor_system_but_i_feel_like_a/djmo2tu/). Which would solve this issue to some extent if it goes on your profile.","replies":[]}]}
