Previously, I was playing enough to get 3-5 of the Hextech Champ things a week. So I was just rerolling all the champs and getting an avg of 1-2 champs a week, I&#039;m about 20 champs from finishing the current champ pool. However, under the new system, I can no longer purchase Hextech champ crates, nor reroll shards. I have to &#039;save up&#039; BE to buy the champ or get lucky enough to get the shard and get it a slight bit cheaper that way. However, with champs being worth a whopping 90-300 shards, that&#039;s going to take forever. Since the changeover, I have been able to afford **-1-** new champion. \n\nRiot is really not thinking of newer players getting into the game unless they&#039;re willing to fork over cash and buy champions, cos they&#039;re sure not going to get them through BE.\n\nI&#039;m bitterly disappointed, as a completionist I was REALLY looking forward to finishing the set of champ&#039;s in the coming weeks. Now that will be sometime in the next 12 months unless I buy RP and just pay for the champs, which I refuse to do. The point of MOBA clones is to pay to make them pretty, not to pay to play them.\n\nI started playing in June of 2010 and in all that time, this is the first move Riot have made that has **=truly=** saddened me.\n\nPoor form Riot, Poor form.\n\n[EDIT]\nForgot to mention that I'm only really proficient as a support and I've learnt a few Top/Mid/Jng's so I have max'd out my crate wins until they unlock.","replies":[{"poster":"QAPLA","date":"2017-12-01T23:03:45.431+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"new system is shit, everyone knows it.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Wean","date":"2017-11-30T20:54:20.961+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I really wish that Riot gives us Blue Essence in some way, other than just leveling up.\nCurrently Riot gives us Project Missions, and once we complete it, we get Project icon, and inside the Project icon, you will see Blue Essence, earn tokens by completing missions, and exchange them for Blue Essence, 1 token gives 20 Blue Essence.\nBut even with this way, you won't get as much Blue Essence anyway, \nThey also give 50 Blue Essence for First Win of the Day, but it does not help much, you still have a long way to go to get enough Blue Essence.\nIf Riot can give us straight up Blue Essence for completing missions, and if they give us missions that would grant us tokens, and if they can increase the amount of Blue Essence per token (like 150-200 Blue Essence per token) would be sufficient, also, giving us missions that would earn us even more tokens like 24-32 tokens, would be good idea too.","replies":[{"poster":"Arkangyle","date":"2017-12-01T02:19:20.161+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Wean,realm=OCE,application-id=Ntey9fRZ,discussion-id=kXg8IiIH,comment-id=0000,timestamp=2017-11-30T20:54:20.961+0000)\n>\n\n> If Riot can give us straight up Blue Essence for completing missions, and if they give us missions that would grant us tokens, and if they can increase the amount of Blue Essence per token (like 150-200 Blue Essence per token) would be sufficient, also, giving us missions that would earn us even more tokens like 24-32 tokens, would be good idea too.\n\nProject missions give you 96 tokens.
