People seriously need to get over the fact that their teammates are human just like them, and as humans, we make mistakes. I know this has been said a million times, but no one is perfect.\n\nI can't speak for everyone here, but most of the time I have decent teammates that can carry their own weight, and 1/10 I'm matched with someone who isn't having the best game.\n\nSo basically, my message to players such as yourself is; shit happens, time to move on, and play the game.","replies":[]}]}
