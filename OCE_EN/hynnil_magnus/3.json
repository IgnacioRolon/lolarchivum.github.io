I just wanted to share a few resources that I have found that I have found useful that may help other bronze players in a similar position.\n\nhttp://bronzetodiamond.ga - Shared to me by a friend, a relatively new site by the looks of it. But I found the information on it useful. Particularly regarding last hitting. The creator is a Diamond player and appears to know what he is talking about. The website is free and personally I will continue to monitor this site.\n\ntwitch.tv/trick2g - Tricks stream can be entertaining from time to time but it is also pretty informative. He talks a lot about why he does certain things in certain situations. He teaches things that can be easily applied. His spectates and subwars are quiet good for learning too as he often points out mistakes and what they should be doing. \n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UChBb5BEX36y-DXK7uISYbzg - Pants are Dragon - Challenger player that creates great you-tube videos the information he shares is priceless.\n\nAnyway I hope these sites help you guys as much as they are helping me.","replies":[{"poster":"Cupidism","date":"2016-02-17T06:23:34.077+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You tube has a few players who coach others and post the videos. I found these to be hugely helpful for me last year. I used to just play for poops and giggles doing whatever i wanted. once i was i told there were free goodies to be had at the end of a season i started up ranked. languished in bronze for ages until i watched a few of these coaching videos.\n\nI think Veggematic was one. but pick a position or champ type that 'adc coaching' into you tube and watch a few videos they point out some very basic stuff that i had never considered before and got me into gold last season. I found vegge and.. lastshadow good because they would pause and draw on the screen to explain all the things.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Darcy","date":"2016-02-16T08:08:16.088+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Don't try and get good by watching twitch streamers... They almost always know what they're doing and you won't understand the context behind any of it. You just have to keep playing, don't get salty and learn from your mistakes. Don't be a dumbass, but don't be a pussy.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Z3npachi","date":"2016-02-16T01:29:43.048+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Trick is more entertainment than teaching IMO. A lot of the streamers information will be lost on lower elo ears because they just don't understand the very basics of the game but what information they can decipher and pickup will be very useful.\nPantsaredragon is a really good source of information but sometimes may be too advanced for low elo players to implement.\n\nLow elos should focus on , last hitting, warding, checking the mini map every 3-7 seconds to keep an eye on what is happening on the map.\n\nPlay safe, build safe, take safe runes/masteries, as you slowly progress in mechanic execution and learn the limits of your champion and the capabilities of other champions , you change your play style to be more aggressive. \n\nAt the end of the day it doesn't really matter, enjoy the game, have fun. If you really want to rise through the ranks, then put in the required effort. Watch videos on youtube, read guides, watch lcs, watch streamers, but most of all play a lot of games. Everything will fall in place and you will find games progressively get easier and easier to win.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Alfawarrior3","date":"2016-02-16T00:56:30.080+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"\\>trick2g\nhahahahahha\n\nbronze is piss easy to get out of. just pick one of the many OP champs and spam them in ranked. you'll be out within a week.","replies":[]}]}
