However, I do have a strong concern with the queues priority with the **assignment** of roles. \r\n\r\nLately, \r\nI&#039;ve been actively spectating numerous ranked games that my friends play in, majority being ROLE/LANE OTP&#039;s (_One Trick Pony&#039;s_), and see them being forced into their secondary far too often. \r\n\r\nI understand that from a wider perspective, they should be capable of playing other roles to at least a decent standard, but watching them lose consecutively because they&#039;ve been forced into their off-role 6 times in a row doesn&#039;t appeal to me as a balanced choice making system. \r\n\r\nCould anybody with the knowledge, or a Riot employee shed some light over this; as to why the firm majority of my friends are seen to have the weaker priority after being placed in their **Secondary** more often than the **Primary**?\r\n\r\n_**TL;DR: Friends constantly getting assigned their Secondary more often than being assigned Primary.

Yes I get that supports are much more rare, but I feel like the algorithims should at least see \"Oh, this person has gotten X role repeatedly, we should probably chuck them in their other role this time,\" otherwise what's the point in a primary pick?\nI'm sure they'll work something out eventually though.

Because it's common for S2-G4 players to play together, and the S5 most likewly was higher last season and had bad placements (but good mmr). Them being plat last season doesn't necessarily mean much. They both have negative W/L in ranked so likely they are much closer to where they should be now.\n\nForgive me if I'm missing something, but I don't see anything wrong with this match.

They were also placed on the red team indicating they had a higher MMR overall anyway even if their ranks weren't enough.

I've seen this a lot in my own games as well as in others where the higher mmr team was on blue side.\n\nIf you specify what exactly it is you are looking at maybe I could try to explain it for you, but I don't see anything wrong. There are a multitude of reasons those two might have been plat last season, but it doesn't mean much when they have a negative winrate in low Gold. The skill difference between high silver and low gold isn't that big.","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2016-02-25T13:05:48.078+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It comes down to how popular a role is. The system will try to give you your primary within limits. Supp > Jung are the easiest roles to get, as they are the least popular.

The Dynamic picks is good but needs to be dynamic solo only mode to make ranked mean something. I may not even try in games where its a group of friends vs a smaller group of friends or just solos. riot says It is suppose to mirror the lobbies so that if there is a duo on one side, it should also be a duo on the other team, that is not the case for me.\n\nSo if the match making makes it unfair, I make its 4v5.
