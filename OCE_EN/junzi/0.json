Nightblue tilted in champ select after Nubrac asked if he wanted to duo. Then instead of playing the game, he repeatedly threatened Nubrac with bans then afk'd, Nubrac didnt really retaliate and continued to play out the match. I would say that Nightblue is the main reason they didnt win that game. His ban linked to that game, in which he should not have been banned.","replies":[{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2019-06-25T04:15:08.169+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Not the whole game, which I why I didn't want to get too in-depth. I didn't comment on NB3's behaviour at all. This was about Nubrac, and as I understand it, this was one of many games where Nubrac specifically targeted a certain set of players (streamers) with the intention of getting a negative reaction. I.E griefing.\n\nShould he have had more than this one game linked? Probably. Does that change what he did? No.\n","replies":[{"poster":"Outis","date":"2019-06-26T01:45:46.700+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"firstly , what was the evidence that it was intentional to grief? was it chat logs? vods? why was this not found in the prior investigation if now apparently there is evidence.\n\nsecondly, he has a big match history of playing this 'strat'. so why is it only deemed bannable if he plays it with streamers and upsets them but it's fine (and there is direct quotes from riot telling him it is fine to play) to play with 'regular' people?","replies":[{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2019-06-26T09:03:00.137+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"It was in his VODs, but there's a lot of second-hand, sometimes wildly inaccurate and often conflicting information being thrown around. From the (seemingly) reliable information I've found, to the best of my understanding they both were deserving of punishment and were both eventually punished.\n\nAs to why it wasn't found in the first review, I would say it's likely the publicity. One person doing a review, particularly one who probably isn't watching the streams, and is more likely looking at replays and chat logs, may well have missed or not been looking in the right places for appropriately incriminating information. Now there is an entire community invested in this, and many among that community will find and submit to Riot the appropriate evidence without them having to comb through dozens of VODs themselves.\n\nThe strat was never deemed bannable. The strat was never the problem, and the strat was not why he was punished. He was not banned for what he was playing, or who he was playing with. He was banned for intentionally targeting and trolling a specific group of people in a way he knew would generate a negative reaction.\n\nIf I played his exact strat in a regular game, told my team what I was doing, and played to win, then that's a-okay, *because that's not why he was banned*.\n\nIf every time someone in my lobby has a capital C in their name I decide \"let's piss this person off\", and play something they explicitly asked me not to (for a reasonable reason) *because* they didn't want me to, and generally make an effort to make their game a miserable experience, then that is a problem and is deserving of a punishment.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Asriel As U Get","date":"2019-06-22T01:31:18.381+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It's also supported by the fact that he has a 48% Winrate with this strat in 400 games.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"damageguy69","date":"2019-06-25T11:15:41.188+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"NB3 can get banned as long as Nubrac did too the dude actually just griefs high elo","replies":[{"poster":"damageguy69","date":"2019-06-25T11:17:09.822+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"its actually astounding people defended the teemo in this situation","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"leaferreafer","date":"2019-06-22T01:41:05.971+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"why did nightblue get banned? did he win a game?","replies":[]}]}
