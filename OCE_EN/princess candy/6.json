If you join and you already have some friends on facebook who are girls who play league feel free to add them too, the more the merrier. From the guys, please no hate, I&#039;m in no way being sexist, plenty of my friends are guys, but this is just so that girls can make other girl friends who play league on OCE.","replies":[{"poster":"Miicka","date":"2017-09-12T00:49:53.433+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"What is a grill?","replies":[]}]}
