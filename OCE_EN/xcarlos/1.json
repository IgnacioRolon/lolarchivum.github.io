Queued up in ranked soloq, after a long wait a match was found. All was good until someone dodged in champ select. Then I was no longer in queue, I couldn&#039;t play (the play button was not working). I had to restart the client and now I have to wait another 20 minutes. (This was in alpha client). After you&#039;ve waited in low priority queue, you should not wait it out again unless you leave, am I right?","replies":[]}
