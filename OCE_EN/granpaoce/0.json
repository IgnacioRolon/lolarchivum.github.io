Take it personally. Ruin your game.\n2. Don't take it personally. Enjoy your game.\n\nPeople who are easily offended seem to find a hell of a lot more 'racism' and 'sexism' in the world than people who aren't. Now I'm no mathematician, but I don't think that's a coincidence.\n\nIn all my years of league, I have yet to see one person that I thought was **genuinely** racist or homophobic. I've seen plenty of less-than-appropriate jokes, and lots of people saying something nasty in a moment of frustration. But I've never had the impression that once the game has ended, a player has gone and started throwing darts at a picture of a black person's face on the wall. \nMore likely they've gone and thrown their mouse across the room because they failed flash and died and you didn't, and they care a hell of a lot more about that than whatever colour skin your wife happens to have.\n___________\n\nLee's behaviour is well within the limits of being defined as Toxic, and I'm sure he will inevitably relieve a punishment for it! but unless you think that he genuinely abhors the mere sight of a black person, I think blowing it up into a 'racism' charge is over the top.\n\nThere is a lot of toxic behaviour in the world, and it is impossible to change every single person on the planet's behaviour to align with your morals. You can weed a lot of it out with systems like the one Riot has in place, but there will ALWAYS be some negative behaviour that seeps though. And you can either choose to be offended by that or not.\n\nYour wife hasn't changed, she's still the same person she was before some 12 year old called her names on an online game. So why is it a problem?\n\nOffence isn't given, it's taken.\nAnd your best defence against it in life is a thick skin.\n\n___________\n\nI know all this sound a bit harsh, and I don't mean to be insensitive.\nBut me saying: _\"Oh no thats terrible, I hope they get banned!\"_ doesn't actually help anyone here.  It doesn't help them get banned, and it doesn't help you enjoy the game next time someone says the N word.\n\nBecause the real problem here isn't the fact that they didn't get banned for saying the N word, the problem is, you're not enjoying the game when people do. And that is more important to me than if some random kid gets banned. So I'm offering my solution to try and make your games more enjoyable.\n\nSometimes a slap in the face is more helpful than a pat on the back, even if it's not what you want at the time.\nSo this is my slap. :P\n\nIm not saying racism isn't a problem when it happens!\nIm saying that a lot of the time, it isn't actually 'racism'.\n\nAnyway, this is just my personal view on the subject, and views are always subjective. :P\nWhatever the case may be, I hope you enjoy future games more than this one.\n{{sticker:slayer-jinx-catface}}","replies":[{"poster":"Smoke Kush","date":"2017-09-21T05:16:47.013+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"***","replies":[{"poster":"Lord Sesshomaru","date":"2017-09-21T09:20:25.521+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Maybe if you did read it, you'd know it is the exact opposite of leftist xD","replies":[{"poster":"Hi Im Dream","date":"2017-09-22T14:23:12.342+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Now seeming you have no control over other people's behaviour, you only have two options:\n1. Take it personally. Ruin your game.\n2. Don't take it personally. Enjoy your game.\n\nThis is irrelevant because, I could argue that the game would already be ruined from the Lee sin, for example I get demotivated to play the game if we are behind and someone starts abusing another player for NO reason and so do a lot of other people.\n\nI played 10 games on an old smurf I gave to a friend a long time ago, (I reclaimed it because he quit and wouldn't care if I took the account back) only to skip a 1 week ban and any chat restrictions into a 2 week ban, for just getting frustrated in 1-3 games, a 2 week ban over 10 games is just ridiculous, especially when what follows is a perm banned, guess what! after 2 days of playing (I think I went 15-5) overall out of 20 games I got a perm ban, the final game which I got perm banned in, all I said was \"%%%%%%%%%%%\" directed to my friend, a Chinese player on my team took offense to this and decided he wasn't going to lane bot with my (duo) and instead chose to troll the game, I didn't even abuse him, I will admit I got a little frustrated over the fact that someone could be so sensitive over nothing, but I refrained from attacking him personally or using vulgar language as I knew that there would be a chance that I could be banned.\n\n\nGame 1\n%%%%%%%%%%%\n: cya\n im jg\n: HAHAHAHAHA\n im also asian\nr: rofl\n: i wasnt even talking to him\n: wtf\n: ahahahaha\n: vlad\nfor cdr\n: %%%%%%%%%%%\n im chinese too\n: ..\n: ni hao\n: ask sivir\n abc\n thats not very nice\n: cn not dog\n :(\n i love china\ni love how we're almost\n: 3v5ing\n but nasus vlad\nstill not grouping\n oh wells 2late now\n: we were literally 3v5ing mid\n: like 5x in a row\nand they live\n: low hp\n and neither of u come\n: we have sivir\n ult\n: rofl\n: i wudnt have even ganked top\n if i knew u wudnt gank\n: u got a lead and did nothing\n\n^This is the whole chatlog on my ban card, now tell me does that constitute a perm ban? especially when the guy made it 4v5 by constantly roaming around the map instead of laning bot, also I carried this guy the game before, and had no problems.\n\nBut na the real toxic player (That actually ruins games) remains unbanned because he doesn't type and if he does abuse people it's in Chinese, but why bother typing when you can just ruin the game for them? He called me a dog because I said I was chinese (Which I am, my duo is also asian hence why I was just picking at him) I told him chinese pple aren't dogs and that I love china to try and make him play as we were still winning despite it being 4v5.

This strikes me as a HUGE example of silence lends consent.  If nothing else slap a 1 week ban on the account and specify it's for racist remarks and comments/behaviour and maybe the slap on the wrist will force the 12 year old (if he is one) to re-think his position and you'll have done something nice for the world, and just maybe made the community a bit nicer for everyone.  And if he's not one then that's a first offense and if he continues it gets nastier. You don't reward someone behaving like a little sht by giving them an ice-cream.","replies":[]}]}]}
