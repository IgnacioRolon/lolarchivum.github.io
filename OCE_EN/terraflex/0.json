If you want to see what they were but can't find it there, I'd suggest submitting a [Support Ticket](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/requests/new) and they can pull that information.\n\nOtherwise, I agree that the client needs something more like this.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Horizonn","date":"2016-01-18T22:34:42.495+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"If you go to purchases you can see a list of items you have purchased from the store.","replies":[]}]}
