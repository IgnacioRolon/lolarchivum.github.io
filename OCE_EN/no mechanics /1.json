They then decrease to 270 which is constant for the rest of the game. The ping spikes about once every minute and it&#039;s becoming a bit unbearable. I thought it was to do with being in China but I talked to some guy on the other team and he said that he&#039;s lagging in Australia too because of servers. \r\n\r\nWill there be any fix if theres a problem or is it just because I life in a shithole?","replies":[{"poster":"SephirothSG","date":"2016-12-11T01:25:14.833+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey there,\n\nCould you do the following for me;\n\n* [Download WinMTR](https://sourceforge.net/projects/winmtr/files/WinMTR-v092.zip/download) and run a traceroute to the following IP.
