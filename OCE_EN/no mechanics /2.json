It always ends with a message saying &quot;Connection Failure: Unable to connect to the PVP.net server&quot;.  We have checked with other servers (NA, EUW) and we can log on normally. This may be because of the increasing amount of censorship in China, and that China wants to promote it&#039;s own league of legends server, but we highly doubt it due to the fact that NA and EUW have not been banned. This is not my first time posting a thread seeking help for our current situation, and I would appreciate it if someone could troubleshoot the problem for us. \r\n\r\nThanks, \r\nLexPlode","replies":[{"poster":"no mechanics ","date":"2015-07-22T06:58:06.004+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Bump moderators","replies":[]},{"poster":"no mechanics ","date":"2015-07-19T19:39:22.685+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Haha... I did start an account on China but my chinese is just cancer.

It's the most toxic of them all, it always has connection issues (I swear I can connect to NA better than OCE from Australia), and most of the people who play, play to a standard that's less than the rest of the worlds, say, Diamond 1 OCE is same as platinum 1 in NA, and no one listens to reason, their judgment gets clouded easily.\n\n我是澳大利亚人。\n我叫爪。\n对不起，我的中文不好。\n\n哈哈 the only sentence I'm sure is right is the last one... and maybe the 哈哈, which is haha?
