The ranking system is still stuffed there is still no balance in solo/duo. The champions are all over the god damn place. you guys bring out new champions and can&#039;t seem to fix the ones that are out. I honestly don&#039;t understand where the money i have put into skins and champions goes, because its barely put into the game. was gold 3 last season and this season the unbalance runes and unbalance small champion meta is driving this game into the bin.","replies":[{"poster":"Fitzky","date":"2018-02-13T12:54:17.774+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"Smite is looking pretty cool you should go try it out","replies":[]}]}
