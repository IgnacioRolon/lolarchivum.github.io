Loss forgiven is a tool (as Riot states it, \"button\") that they can activate which makes *all* current matches not count if the player loses, ie. the loss is forgiven. It is server-wide and they sparsely use it, only for huge issues that's affecting most players irrelevant of if it's a group or not (meaning if there's an ISP issue, loss forgiven is not activated). To think that it's activated on a single player basis is just absurd.\n\nWhat this board is here for is helping, and that we can do. What ISP are you with and what OS are you on? Does this occur *only* in ranked games?","replies":[]}]}
