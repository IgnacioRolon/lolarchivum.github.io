All game she basically spewed out racist remarks and did not stop abusing my team, so I just muted her but this is what she said in the end game chat.

You said something then he replies calling you bad then you keep dribbling then he keeps calling you bad then that repeats for the whole game then when you finally lose you decided it would be a great idea to try and get a reaction out of him so you can screenshot and post on the boards?\n\nAlso you muted this person so why would you stay in post game chat long enough to be abused and even accept their friend request?","replies":[{"poster":"DinoMuncher","date":"2015-01-20T12:15:30.177+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Actually I never said anything to him all game, after we won he started bragging about how he carried and I basically said he didn't. It escalated from there and I wanted to see how far he went before he went pretty crazy near the end of the game with his racism. I only stayed to see where he would go with it and screenshot it to upload it here and on the ticket that I sent. I accepted his friend request to basically see what he would do like I did with the end game chat.","replies":[{"poster":"RNG Remilia","date":"2015-01-20T14:10:15.405+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hmmm stop dribbling we can tell from the screenshot that you were trying to get a reaction the whole time.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"GoldenTomat0","date":"2015-01-20T05:26:22.150+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=DinoMuncher,realm=OCE,application-id=Ntey9fRZ,discussion-id=jKGxHsQT,comment-id=00000000,timestamp=2015-01-20T05:12:35.808+0000)\n>\n> Don't name and shame?
