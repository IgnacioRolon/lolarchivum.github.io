It wasn't my keyboard, it was the game itself. I recorded a couple minutes of the game where I tried to kill raptors but I could only use my w and e. Thankfully we won the game but it was so odd because I literally couldn't do anything.","replies":[{"poster":"HORSE OF FORCE","date":"2015-02-05T07:32:06.426+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It was an implementation by Riot. They decided that late game Katarina was simply too powerful. They changed her spells to work on a charge system, where she can only use her abilities thirty times or so, and then she can't use them again for the rest of the match. It encourages Kat players to use their skills wisely, and it's an amp substitute for mana cost (which she still lacks).\n\nlol jk\n\nThis is a bug with the game, and hence should be posted on the [bug report board](http://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/bug-report).","replies":[]}]}
