I contacted Support and they basically sent me an email saying that they have no proof of me being toxic, but because I've been reported multiple times they just automatically think I'm toxic and just give me a chat restriction, which takes me out of the draw to get any future cool things that reward good players that riot will give like the random skin they gave a few weeks back. I would just like to say, you might wanna work on your system riot, and what I mean by that is actually make it functional before you start to depend on it. If I could talk to a Riot member, that would be great. I know it won't happen but if a Riot member does see this, Please contact me through my email address.","replies":[{"poster":"HORSE OF FORCE","date":"2015-01-21T06:59:07.398+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I thought it was that if the people are in a party, then their reports only count as one.\n\nThe OCE reporting system is stupid, though.
