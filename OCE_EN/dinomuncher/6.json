Which is why it takes multiple instances of leaving games to trigger a punishment (Although ranked games are treated more serious).\n\nFor more information regarding the Leaverbuster system and how it functions check out the [Leaverbuster FAQ](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752714-LeaverBuster-FAQ).","replies":[]}]}
