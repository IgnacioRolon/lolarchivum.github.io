I brought it up to myself to be nice in every single I've played and I have been nice, but with the league community you do get random reports because the enemy team is either salty or just mad. I'm not asking for you to remove every bad possible thing that has happened on my account, I'm just asking for you to remove the chat restricted thing from my account so It doesn't prevent me from getting good stuff like the free random skin that we got from Riot. Hell, if you remove it but I still have to have the chat restriction I'm still fine with that!","replies":[{"poster":"HORSE OF FORCE","date":"2015-01-17T05:46:15.936+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":">for a legitimate reason\n\nWhat's not legitimate for you may be legitimate for others.\n\nAdditionally, the skins were already gifted.
