Help Please","subforum":"Miscellaneous","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"So my friend told me about the whole free skin from Riot, and at this point I didn't know about it so I checked my account and I didn't get one....thats fine, he said it may take some time since his brother didn't get one either yet so I waited. I don't know the full details but the more I wait, the more I think I'm not gonna get one. He said something about Good Behaviour, and while I haven't been the best league player over the years I know I'm not such a nuisance to the community. Do I not get one because I've been muted before? or is it just some glitch? If it is because I've been muted before, I really think Riot should re-evaluate their reporting system. I'm not saying I should've never been muted because I'm the nicest person in the world....I'm just saying that a pre made team can get you muted by reporting you just because one of them don't like you, it's happened to me plenty of times so I would know + It's happened to my friends as well. If it is because I've been muted, I'd be pretty disappointed because I missed out on a great opportunity to get a free skin from the Company that made the game I love to play, but oh well I guess thats what I get lol","replies":[{"poster":"Garens Harem","date":"2015-01-10T04:13:46.177+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"patience....\n\n\nso many people are so impatient\n\n{{champion:79}} {{champion:79}} {{champion:79}} {{champion:79}} {{champion:79}} {{champion:79}}","replies":[{"poster":"DinoMuncher","date":"2015-01-10T05:19:39.731+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You didn't answer my question, does getting muted affect it?","replies":[{"poster":"Slim Chaedi","date":"2015-01-10T05:25:39.915+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=DinoMuncher,realm=OCE,application-id=Ntey9fRZ,discussion-id=GtjNN02o,comment-id=00000000,timestamp=2015-01-10T05:19:39.731+0000)\n>\n> You didn't answer my question, does getting muted affect it?\n\nlol no.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Jehovahs Witness","date":"2015-01-10T05:33:00.517+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You won't get one is you have been either:\nChat Restricted\nRanked Restricted\n14 Day Banned\nPermanently Banned\n\nin 2014.\nAlso, you are only eligible is you are:\nOver Level 5\nYou have a minimum of 10 skins that you don't own.\n\nOther than that, be patient.","replies":[{"poster":"DinoMuncher","date":"2015-01-10T08:48:26.849+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yay, so no skin for me since I've been muted before.
