I want to learn how to match up against them so they don't get easy wins in ranked. Does anyone have any advice on how to improve in the game besides just playing it for a really long time? I usually play top, then mid then jungle then support. I don't play adc because I'm horrible at it, the whole kiting thing and using your mouse heaps just doesn't appeal to me. I'm more of a melee type guy (Trynd). I'm also pretty bad at jungle but I can make it work some games, some games I smash the enemy team and others I just get wrecked.","replies":[{"poster":"Essembie","date":"2015-02-17T01:15:21.545+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"rage\ntroll\ninstalock\ngive up after first blood\ncall duo, then suck\nsay you're plat 1 so you get the lane you want\n\n\nall strategies that work well in bronze.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Schakle","date":"2015-02-17T00:34:55.166+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"So you want general tips?

Buy wards literally each time you base if you have the gold for it, vision can win games believe it or not. (Stops those dumpsters on your team facechecking the enemy jungle and throwing the game.)\n\n2. Don't go spending %%%%loads of gold on hp/mana pots, if you're deadset buying 4+ of either and using them all in lane then your playstyle is some low elo stuff bro - play a lil smarter.\n3. IF YOUR LANE OPPONENT GOES TO ROAM THEN ALERT PING THE PATH THEY ARE TAKING SO YOUR TEAM KNOWS THAT SOMEONE IS COMING AND **WHERE FROM**.\n4. If you can get your team to group before the enemy team then you'll have a 76% chance of winning that game.\n5. \"Fool me once, shame on you; fool me twice, shame on me.\" LEARN TO EXPECT CHEESY %%%% FROM PLAYERS LIKE **BUSH CAMPING**, 2:19 **GANKS** FROM SHACO VERMIN, AND THE MOST COMMONLY COMPLAINED ABOUT!!!! A LEVEL 2 FLASH + IGNITE **ALL IN**. \n\n6. If you're confident you can win a lane matchup then go ahead and try, if not then play for cs since the chances are your champ's probably lategame focused and theirs is early - mid game so don't feed em the lead they need to win before you power spike.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Maraudaur","date":"2015-02-14T00:43:52.948+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCeGtVfZD9LVttCJzjIJLY1g \n\nThese lectures are a good watch!","replies":[]},{"poster":"Knuuckles","date":"2015-02-13T22:32:15.886+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"best advice is to not die in lane, cs, roam in this elo roaming will put enemy team on tilt because they don't call MIA 80% of the time and then they get mad at the laner","replies":[]},{"poster":"VENI VIDI VICI","date":"2015-02-13T18:43:48.354+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Watch the pros! http://www.twitch.tv/directory/game/League%20of%20Legends","replies":[]},{"poster":"Sacharissa","date":"2015-02-13T17:31:22.489+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Don't think about winning.
