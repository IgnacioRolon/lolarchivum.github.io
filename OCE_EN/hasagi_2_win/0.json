(RIOT PLEASE READ)","subforum":"Help & Support (OCE)","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Ok, so i was just playing League of Legends minding my own buisness until i had to go somewhere. Then i thought it wouldn't take as long so i kept LoL on and no i did not go AFK in the middle of a match, i went AFK in the home screen. But then when i came back its said something about a error or something with a red triangle near the play button. Because it wouldn't go away i just exited the game and tried going back on, but this is the part which led me to making this thread. When i pressed my League of Legends shortcut this is what it said...\"Could not connect to the HTTP server, please check that your internet connection is enabled and that your Firewall is not blocking access\" I really want to play League of Legends again soon but have no clue on fixing this error. If you could tell me how that would be amazing! Riot please read this and respond or fix this error. Any tips on the Firewall part you can tell me. Thank you in advance. -Nagasaki Reborn","replies":[{"poster":"Strat","date":"2015-01-09T09:56:40.946+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"I tried a bunch of things and it didn't work, but it seems like the problem has been resolved for me now. Flush your DNS and try your client, it'll probably work for you too now.

Some people just want to sit down and play the game.\n\nIt the same vein that it doesn't take much effort to search up instructions on how to do it yourself, it doesn't take much effort to instruct someone else on how to do it. If not that, then at least link them to instructions which they can follow.\n\nWhat is the point of the help and support boards?","replies":[{"poster":"Strat","date":"2015-01-17T12:56:34.189+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'm not going to reward laziness. I didn't deny that it wouldn't be hard to just help him out, but it does not take computer savvyness to type \"how to change my DNS\" into Google. If he learns to seek out answers himself, he'll save countless hours of his own time in the future, and not waste others' time. You literally made his life worse in return for short term gratification by giving him the information.\n\nI pointed him in the right direction. That's what a help and support board is for. If he wants to be spoonfed, he should contact Riot Support and not the player base. Riot is using people like you as free labor, I hope you enjoy being used.","replies":[{"poster":"HORSE OF FORCE","date":"2015-01-17T22:46:22.919+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"What if you don't use Google? Don't make the presumption everyone just loves using search engines, giving away all their personal details so that a wealthy internet company can sell them to third-party advertisers to gain a lot of profit for espionage.\n\nugh\n\nWhat I'm saying is that the help and support boards is to help and support people, not just redirect them. And hell, if you are really that lazy yourself, you could at least link them to Riot's support page. The reason of this boards existence is so that people can try to get an answer instantly from people who may have already fixed it themselves.\n\nAnd I don't consider helping others out to be 'labour'.","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"HORSE OF FORCE","date":"2015-01-10T23:50:10.088+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"[Riot's official instructions.](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues#wq4)\n\nIn summary, go to Control Panel>Network And Internet>Network And Sharing Center>Change adapter settings.
