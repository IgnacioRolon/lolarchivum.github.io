Here is my feedback,\r\n\r\nI went to the Hoyts viewing for the World Championships at Melbourne Central in Victoria. While I thoroughly enjoyed the world final (go Samsung!), I was very disappointed by the way in which the viewing at Hoyts was hosted. Firstly, when I entered the cinema at around 5:30pm, I was greeted by a sea of people who had League of Legends thundersticks and League of Legends drawstring bags. However, when I got to my seats with my 3 other friends, there were no goodie bags to be seen at our seats. I would assume that they were there but when people started to come in others were taking multiple bags from other seats in order to get more free stuff. This was very sad and left us disappointed. It wasn&#039;t necessarily that we didn&#039;t get free stuff, it was mainly that whoever organised the distribution of these bags thought it would be a good idea to have them on each seat, not expecting for people to just take more than one. I feel like this was really poorly organised and not much effort really went into making sure the customer would enjoy their experience. I also noticed that there were no staff present whatsoever throughout the event. When I went to the 2014 viewing party at Village Cinemas in Crown Casino, they had staff at the door of the cinema handing out the goodie bags as people were entering the cinema. They also had a host, who was interacting with the crowd in between games and really setting an enjoyable and interactive mood throughout the night. This was much more enjoyable than just walking into the cinema, watching the games and then leaving. I hope that there will be improvements to future hosted events, as I would not consider going to another viewing party without any changes being made. \r\n\r\nPlease feel free to contact me if you have further questions/feedback for this event.","replies":[{"poster":"Jason","date":"2017-11-05T10:47:27.930+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"Sorry to hear the disappointment Rexx. I'll pass this on to the group that ran the Hoyts Central viewing party. \n\nI hosted the Worlds 2016 as well as the OPL Finals at Hoyts this year at Central, and this year I was at Victoria Gardens for Worlds instead of Central. It was a much smaller venue, super cosy. A lot less stressful than the 100+ capacity of Melbourne Central. Seems like manpower was streched thin this year for Worlds, and they tried something new for swag bag distribution. The 2014 style you saw was more my style of running things, but different organizers have different methods and ideas.\n\nWith feedback like this, we can tell when ideas work well, and... when they fall to pieces. So, thanks for vocalising the problem, so we can work towards it not happening again in the future. \n\n:)","replies":[]},{"poster":"belquin","date":"2017-11-07T23:56:16.679+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Really appreciate the feedback Rexx - that's really disappointing to hear that people decided to take extras :( \n\nWe are sitting down today to review the viewing parties today and will definitely bring your feedback up.\n\nCheers!","replies":[]}]}
