I have tried literally every troubleshoot option provided by riot and the internet, nothing has worked and I have lost so many games because of it. Clash starts in 2.5 hrs and I feel that I am going to cost my team the game simply because I am going to dc. Everything works internet-wise besides league, so it must be server side(discord, youtube, web pages, reddit, etc.) I have not updated anything on my computer and I play regularly. This problem just started happening randomly yesterday. Please help","replies":[{"poster":"0riginalName","date":"2018-05-25T07:09:32.056+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"A friend and I have been having the same issue. We always DC at the exact same time but it only effects league. Everything else that we have on our computers can still use the internet perfectly. We do have the same ISP (Telsta) how ever we weren't the only people in our 5man to use telstra but it was only us DCing. It has happened in my last 5 games or so without fail and there is nothing we can do on our end to fix the problem.","replies":[{"poster":"Hawaii","date":"2018-05-25T07:58:06.880+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"exact same thing yep, I too have Telstra but everything else works, its not the isp","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"GroveruK","date":"2018-05-27T05:56:23.378+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"problem still persists can someone help please","replies":[]},{"poster":"GroveruK","date":"2018-05-26T02:27:10.805+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Can we please have a red response on this literally every game i disconnect for no reason there is an issue with telstra users and it's not the isp please let us know whats going on","replies":[]},{"poster":"GroveruK","date":"2018-05-25T14:14:00.074+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"yep can confirm i also have telstra and random disconnects are occuring for me in ranked. drops out for around 2 minutes then comes back. everything else works reddit, teamspeak etc but league server dc's.
