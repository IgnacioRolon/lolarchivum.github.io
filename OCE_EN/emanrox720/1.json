I told them both to stop because it wasn&#039;t worth arguing over. I also said to BOTH my friend and the other players that they are BEING the kind of assholes that make league annoying to play sometimes. They then proceed to verbal abuse me and challenge me to a 1v1 I accepted the friend request to Try talk to one of them named skuxxbrazz saying Look man I didn&#039;t mean to make upset and I&#039;m sorry for my friends but there is no reason to be angry with me. He then threatened to hack me which would be fine if my league was filled with skins from my friends, which it is. he said things like better watch your acc because if you log out you won&#039;t be able t log back in. at this point i got a bit worried, right. so i go to talk to his friend who also was involved [7:28] Emanrox720: Dude what is it??\r\n[7:31] sUp0rT3r: you gonna get hacked man my mate is allread doing it listen dont log out of your acc or u wont be allowed back in\r\n[7:32] Emanrox720: Yeah man Look about that I wouldn&#039;t mind if it was Just my money spent on the game but it&#039;s my friends money could actually not do this?\r\n[7:33] sUp0rT3r: its not my proble, you where trash talking\r\nhe has allready banned like 13 ppl in like 2 months he is the hacker\r\n[7:34] Emanrox720: I did talk trash I was sikent for most of the game\r\ndidn&#039;t*\r\n[7:34] sUp0rT3r: you did at the end  oh dw he is banning ur mates\r\n[7:35] Emanrox720: I was referencing Kill la Kill the anime man :P\r\n[7:35] sUp0rT3r: no you wernt \r\n[7:35] Emanrox720: what did i say?\r\n[7:36] sUp0rT3r: idk well i have nothin to do with this you getting hacked \r\n[7:37] Emanrox720: You said he was your friend?\r\n[7:37] sUp0rT3r: he s is\r\n[7:37] Emanrox720: So you can tell him not to I&#039;m pretty sure I said you were being the assholes that everyone hates on league, I didn&#039;t say you are assholes.
