It is MMR now.\nThe issue is that Riot keeps the MMR system under lock and key.\n\nThis in itself causes issues. Let's say I said to you { For a point of reference } I will give you $1000 every time you did something for me. But then never told you what you had to do for it.\nYou would give up and just not worry about it??\n\nWRONG.\n\nYou will ask over and over.. Keep trying to work out what it is and so on.\nBut then again I could just be telling you a lie for the sake of trying to make you think that elo is gone when it isn't.\n\nSee the issue really isnt that elo is or isn't gone. The issue is with the MMR system itself.\nMost of the time you are in matches that are one sided. \n\nLike last night. I had a game that went for 40+ mins and it was great. WE WERE EVEN.\nBut the 10 games before that was one sided. Either I owned them or they owned me. The fact people are even talking about the MMR or elo points to the fact that there is a big issue with MMR.\n\nBut when you point this out everyone jumps on the wagon of \" GET GOOD \" or \" YOU SUCK. \"\n\nCase in point\n\n \n> [{quoted}](name=Arkangyle,realm=OCE,application-id=T8eq2lFQ,discussion-id=coEtRJwI,comment-id=0004,timestamp=2017-05-13T14:50:13.859+0000)\n>\n> Just looking at your match history, in your last 5 ranked matches your direct lane opponent went:\n> \n> 13/7/4\n> 10/2/11\n> 18/6/4\n> 17/0/2\n> 10/2/0\n> \n> In those games you also had an average cs/min of 4.3\n> \n> I&#x27;m not saying these losses are your fault, but I&#x27;m thinking you might want to review your own performance before just blaming your team.\n\n\nThis is a moronic mindset to have because from the start you have taken the idea you are better then them. \nInstead of the mind set.. We see 100+ post of this every week. \n\nmm MAYBE there is a issue. Might be time for some rethinking. \nWhen you think about what is really going on and the matches you have.. They shouldn't be one sided. They should be fun and hard to win. \nYou shouldn't have one player that is just melting everyone.","replies":[]},{"poster":"CHEESYLEEKS","date":"2017-05-14T20:28:14.198+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The thing about elo is it was designed to rank a player for there win loss rate in chess\n\nThe thing about league is there are 5 players and no individual scoring system so your always going to be held back by the short comings of your team mates and be penalised for it.\n\nIts a shitty system for a team game","replies":[]},{"poster":"King Crow","date":"2017-05-13T08:09:01.012+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It's not impossible to climb the ranks with the increasing numbers of toxic players or bad players in general. If you're determined enough to find a group of friends who are decent at the game you can improve your rank significantly. \nAlso, perhaps the best solution is to work on your own game. You will be able to improve your ranking much faster if you play skillfully well above your current rank.
