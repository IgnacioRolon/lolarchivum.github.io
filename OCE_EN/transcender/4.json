Koreans follow it because it's the most optimal usage of them to get the highest possible win % and it's changing quite a bit (runes and masteries wise) to keep being the optimal setup, that's why you should copy it.\n\n> I have reached a fairly high standard relative to the average gamer in basically every game I have played, yet after about 5 years, the only games I cannot seem to \"perform\" in are those which rely on others to increase my rank.\nI do however wrongfully assume that others are able to easily do what I can do, this has been proven.\n\nYou only rely on others to an extent and I would assume you know this but as you said yourself, you won't pay for chall level coaching because you're sceptical. You can *easily* carry in your elo even on adc but you just simply don't know how to. In your elo, it's possible to go 5/0 with a constant 20+ cs lead 12 minutes in almost every single game and win by 25 minutes. Every single time you die in a game it can always be lead back to you doing something and you're not good enough to be able to tell if it was the correct decision or not, platinum level coaching can do this for you. \n\nOn your top 3 champions, your average death total is 7. In that elo where diving is less prominent/well played and they don't know how to push leads etc, you should be able to average 1-2 max if you're playing it correctly. Having your average deaths this high shows that you are fucking up, a lot. \n\n> 1000+ games on ashe, 1500+ games on twitch and maybe 100-200 games on caitlyn.\nDid I mention that I am looking for a challenger player to teach me how to adc and get 80% win rate in low elo solo queue?\n\nOn wasted-on-lol, I've over doubled the amount of time you've played. I'm quite worthy on the game knowledge side and I have managed to get Diamond 1 and have been an adc main for 3-4 seasons so I do know what I'm talking about. I am telling you a lot of useful information, especially the setup stuff and mentally knowing you can carry every game in low elo (unless 3 afk's or something crazy like that). I've been coached extensively and been on competitive teams and have been diamond+ for years, you should really take my word on a lot of this, I mean I'm not chall, but i'm better than most you will get.\n\n> I have been doing all of this, for approximately 100% of my games.

It is not simply your fault, especially in a team game. It is a matter of risk vs reward.\n\nWhat i do is focus solely on myself, what it is possible for me to do and everything that can be classed as a mistake on my end for whatever reason I fix if necessary. I strive to be the perfect player, making the correct decisions 100% of the time and never making a misplay or even a slight miss-click. I constantly try to push the boundaries and question everything. If I die, what could I have done differently? What could I have thought about prior to this to save myself or make the correct play? Why did I think the way I did? I fix the mistakes and I move on. Know your win condition and follow, ping a lot, don't miss-play, cs efficiently and never be afraid to push yourself to maximise the training and knowledge you can gain from every situation so you can do that next time. It is easy to improve from the level you are at and you should be able to. You can carry 90% of the games in your division and you aren't because after all that time, you're still  making stupid mistakes and playing like a silver but you don't see it.","replies":[{"poster":"Ryoukan","date":"2017-01-09T17:40:05.169+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Nicely said.

Seriously, everyone is saying mages are taking over the adc role, it is bad enough they have taken over the support role, next thing you know you are gonna be seeing ziggs and lux in the same lane (already happened to me).
