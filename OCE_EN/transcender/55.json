The trick is also communication (positive communication, i feel like you would be a flamer), communication with pings on the map and helpful and encouraging communication in team chat. \n\nUnderstand that you are in bronze (like me) and that *everyone there is probs gonna be mechanically under skilled*. What you have to focus on is taking objectives, seeing rotations and other shot calling, all while maintaining a positive attitude.\n\n *In bronze champ select everyone wants to carry*. To counter this, you should suggest some players play a different type of champion like a tank, mage, poke support, etc (but only if they are comfortable with it, don't force people) so that you actually have a good team comp and you will be surprised how many people will listen to you. 9/10 the enemy team will not have a good team comp to stand up against you. \n\n\n**On the plus side:**\n\n* Your CS has improved\n* Your KDA is somewhat improving \n* You have had some really good games\n\n**Some things you could improve on as an individual:**\n\n* Stop thinking you deserve a higher elo\n* Look at you items and build orders so you can amplify champs natural power spikes\n* Stop blaming everyone else\n\nYou have 120 wins in low bronze with a win rate of 49%, meaning that ***YOU*** need to improve your game in order to climb.","replies":[]},{"poster":"TrashDonnut","date":"2015-03-08T20:38:44.789+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"This is a team game.\n\nHow many can't understand this?","replies":[{"poster":"Transcender","date":"2015-03-09T00:28:45.121+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Apparently 99.9% of players think that in solo queue the games end result is determined by one person and not 10.
