He want to go professional and he want to bring his ideas to the Professional scene. You see \"as refered by Rectum\", this is what a frog in a pond is. Knowing so little yet think he has what it take to make it to the top. He cant even get into plat + or high gold. \n\nTo be even consider for pro play he need to demonstrate in solo Q he has the ability to reach challenger. And stop blaming team, a smurft would have **no problem** getting to challenger, so why does he think he is that good when he cant even climb the ranks? \n\nPro play, yea right.
