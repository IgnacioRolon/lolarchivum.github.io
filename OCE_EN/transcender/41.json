The other 30% my team ACTUALLY did their job better than the enemy and I went from bronze 4 to silver 4 in 3 days. Why all of a sudden have the past 10 games been next to impossible again?\r\n\r\nThis can&#039;t be luck, I just want an explanation as to why i got put with my whole team lower division than the entire enemy team when i was bordering demotion, that is meant to be the sort of thing you deal with in promotion games, not demotion. You give me a blitz that lands 10% of his pulls and is bronze 1 and we are up against a silver 1 enemy. My team never engages and we just slowly lose the game.\r\n\r\nI thought the curse had been lifted and i was finally getting out of bronze/silver!\r\n\r\nIf i get demoted once more this will be the 5th time I end up in bronze and with over 3000 games under my belt that shouldn&#039;t be a thing. I should have at least been in gold by now even if I wasn&#039;t the mvp of most of my games. Even the enemy admits it, yet my team just talks trash to me.\r\n\r\nThis has been going on for far too long and for someone who takes this game seriously it is just unacceptable that this is still how poorly matchmaking can be.","replies":[{"poster":"HORSE OF FORCE","date":"2015-04-09T11:29:09.926+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":">You give me a blitz that lands 10% of his pulls\n\nIt's not like there's some guy on a computer at Rito head-quarters that's like \"Yeah, let's give this sucker a bad Blitz player on his team.
