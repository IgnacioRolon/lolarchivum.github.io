If what you say is true then Elo booster would be out of business lol. jokes :)\n\nJokes aside, I had the same issue last season. I would climb upto Bronze 1 (- to Silver promos) and then I loose the promos and drop all the way back to bronze 4. Then the cycle continues again, climbed to bonze 1 promos , then dropped again back to bronze 4.\n\nBut this season I went from bronze 3 to Silver 5 so ridiculously easy. What I noticed is because I was getting better team mates than me every single game. I mostly play adc, I most got gold players as my supp. They peel nicely for me, I get fed, then I take objectives by myself, i solo drag, solo turrets and inhibs, Solo 2vs1 the enemies, while the gold supp helps the rest of the team.\n\nSo I think ranked is mostly based on luck (if u get afkers, trollers, unskilled etc and the enemy team is really good).\n\nJust give it time dude, you will get lucky soon too like me.\n\nGood Luck :)","replies":[{"poster":"Transcender","date":"2015-02-08T00:51:43.980+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I once went from silver 1 to bronze 3 in under a week.\n\nI have yet to have a support that even supports within the last 10 games as adc.\n\nWhen they do go a real support they don't know how to position or poke or play at all and i have to wait til late game to do anything.\n\nI am just purely over it, because I know it is also like this at gold and platinum level as well and working through that is just too painful.","replies":[{"poster":"godsmustbecrazy3","date":"2015-02-08T04:40:16.824+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"You see, I saw your match history before I made the previous post.\n\nYou had 59 percent win-rate with Twitch and that is a great thing. I would honor you anytime.\n\nYou could have carried that  game easily as an adc if you were Jinx, Corki, misfortune or even gnar etc. Gnar must have been a better pick since your team already had 2 adc carries. It was a troll game from the champ select itself and not your fault too, but if u were fourth or 5 th pick you could have gone someone tanky or with CC. Since cait is very vulnerable too like twitch but she is strong at all points of the game. \n\nWhat you don't realize in the screenshot you posted above is that you played Twitch in that game, and you need good luck to get a decent support to protect you. Since Twitch is really squishy, and his power peaks after 25 mins mark. \n\nIn the mean time if your team feeds in the first 20 mins, each death gives the enemy team 30 percent advantage in gold and experience. But feeding after 45 mins gives them only a 3-4 percent advantage. But the spawning time increases in the late game to 60 secs or more that could give time for adc like Jinx to end the game. You see the point? You or your team chose the loosing game from the champ select itself. It is better to dodge those games and you loose only 3lp. If you play Blackjack, you will know it is better to surrender and fold a weak hand than to risk and loose all the money. Solo queue is similar to Blackjack in most. Know the odds or your chance of winning, loose less while you surrender. Do a quick search of your team mates on champ select in op.gg and should give you an excellent indicator as well.\n\nDoing all this improved my winning rate. \n\nFor one game, I never ever played Nasus before, but my team needed a tank. I heard from people that Nasus was easy to play. So all i did was last hit with Q and got 250 stacks and carried my team after 30 mins. \n\nSo twitch is a very dangerous, risky and very situational pick in Solo queue. Only pick twitch to safe guard for late game if your team has early power champs like Jayce and Pantheon. Then Twitch is an insurance that you wont loose in the late game in case you could not end the game quicker, you can keep farming in the mean time :)\n\nI am really surprised you have 59 percent Twitch winrate with 30+ games :), good on you.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"HORSE OF FORCE","date":"2015-02-08T09:42:51.171+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":">These games are 100% unwinnable.\n\nThat's just a poor attitude. Every game is winnable. For all you know, the enemy might just suddenly decide to do dragon, allowing your team to Baron, for instance, and hence you can push down their structures and win, no matter how far behind you were. Point is, no game is impossible to win.\n\n>Either people need to be told and made aware that solo queue is not a representation of ones ability, but is simply a randomly matched game where the outcome is not even moderately determined by a single player, but the collaboration of all of the players in the game as a whole which does not give an accurate representation of ones ability as a player.\n\nSolo queue was not meant to reflect your individual skill as a player. Most often, one player in a team is not enough to sway the outcome of a battle (that's if they can't communicate or initiate teamwork) It shows how well you can work with strangers of varying skill levels. The point of it all is that it's five strangers working together to defeat five other strangers working together (excusing duo queuing for the moment).\n\nIf you're better than the strangers in which you're being matched with, then chances are that you'll win more games than you'll lose, so inevitably it will only be time until you rank up. If you're still finding that you're losing games you should be winning, then you might want to invest in how to communicate your strategies to these strangers in brief messages in order to decrease their chance of a poor performance. Just keep in mind that they're human beings.\n\nBest of luck with your climbing!","replies":[]}]}
