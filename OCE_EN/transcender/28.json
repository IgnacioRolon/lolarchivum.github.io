For one to achieve a desired win rate, they will need to be 5 times the win rate in effectiveness relative to the average of every player in their game.\n\nFor example, to achieve an 80% win rate, they will need to be 30% over the average which is 50%. So 30% multiplied by 5 is 150%.\n\nbeing 150% more effective than the average of the players on your team means you will have to be a total of 250% effective to the average of your teammates.\n\nI believe ridiculously strongly that luck plays the initial part of winning the game, if the luck is too far out of your favour, then your actions do not become relevant to the relevant outcome of a game. (win or loss)\n\nOver 3 years it has not been proven to me exactly how and why everyone claims that luck is mostly about skill and has very little to do with luck.\n\nSo I would like video evidence of how an ADC can play out and STOMP a standard bot lane while their support is severely handicapped, in essence, a 1v3.\n\nI have been told it is easy for them to do, but I have looked up and could not find any video evidence of this event occuring.\n\nI have been told they consistently can achieve an 80% win rate and this is basically the requirement to achieve it.\n\nWould someone kindly take the time to prove me wrong with video evidence?","replies":[{"poster":"AnÄ±ma","date":"2017-01-12T06:52:44.624+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Even challenger players have came along and shat on all of your arguments to the point where you can't respond most of the time.

But 100% that was always with an advantage, like they were low health or my turret was killing them. It's not a sustainable lane state.\n\nMatchmaking is accurate but it doesn't use LP or rank, it uses the mmr algorithm based on the elo system and bets for you or against you. You'll likely never have a 50/50 chance game to gain 20lp or lose 20lp. It's probably more like '40% chance of winning against this stronger opponent, for 50 points of their elo (+50 you, -50 them), and 60% chance of losing, giving them 25 points of your elo (-25 you, +25 them)'. If you win, you get the higher share cos odds were against you, but if you lose, you only lose a little. Then Riot tries to make it less confusing by slotting you into divisions with an Lp rating.\n\nIt could just be at the moment matchmaker is betting against you because it thinks you should be a lower elo.\n\nPlayers who start losing games find they just cant seem to get a good matchup over a whole series - from 10 to 20 games even - they start blaming themselves and their teams - but really its because matchmaker keeps slotting them into 40/60 games and betting against them. Eventually you'll start playing games that you just can't lose cos your opponents are so bad, and matchmaker will start a reversal of 60/40 games.\n\nIf you get into a 40/60 game you need to be calm and focused - the upset win could be yours!

You start 1200 elo and 1200 lp. You win a stacked game against you. You get 50 elo but only 20 lp. you lose a game stacked against you. You are now 1240elo but only 1200lp cos you lost what you gained in lp. You play the next game. Now you're like 'why am i still playing 1250's (gold) when im only 1200 (silver)'.
