It&#x27;s sad how delusional he is tbh.\n\nThose losses you see in my match history are games I have to de rank, just so I can make sure I don't reach gold so I can play with my team due to rank difference, which includes my 61 year old mother who I taught how to play the game, who right now is better than every mid laner I have ever had in solo queue. Just so we can continue the 92%+ winrate we were having skyrocketing up the ladder.\n\nIt is hilarious how in your delusions you think I am the one who is delusional and yet basic logic and maths just goes right over your head. I had to train my 61 year old mother to do a job you guys can't seem to do. Think about that for a second.","replies":[{"poster":"ErÃ¸se","date":"2016-08-15T07:59:01.844+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"The bullshit on this one is strong hahahaha.\n\nMate, if you can reach gold easily then you would not need a support who follows your every command to win the game.
