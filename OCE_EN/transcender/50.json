That would ironically suggest that you are relying on luck being in your favour to support your claim, in a game that literally relies on luck before your own actions even become relevant. I mean, I have already climbed out of silver and have peaked at gold 4 which already invalidates your first sentence. Which means you assumed it. You then assumed that I play poorly, you must think so badly of all the gold-plat-diamond teams I seem to consistently perform against. Then you try to give me tips as if your previous statements were true in the first place, then you give bad advice which I have already been obliged to test in the past and it failed. After all that garbage you then claim that the comment was on behalf of all the people who simply do not like me because of my opinion which has yet to be disproved which further devalues your statements.\n\nDo yourselves a favour and stop wasting your time trying to cut down what you don't understand.","replies":[{"poster":"Anıma","date":"2017-02-14T02:14:38.750+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":">Consistantly perform against\n\nhttp://imgur.com/a/af5nH Oh yeah baby","replies":[{"poster":"Transcender","date":"2017-02-14T03:05:30.842+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Ryuku,realm=OCE,application-id=mR0UmRrp,discussion-id=YgF4EHYt,comment-id=000100010000,timestamp=2017-02-14T02:14:38.750+0000)\n>\n> http://imgur.com/a/af5nH Oh yeah baby\n\nWell done, you managed to pick the only game I went negative.\n\nLike I said, consistently, not always.","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"CapKebab","date":"2017-02-13T16:09:06.249+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Well That Escalated Quickly.{{champion:78}}","replies":[]},{"poster":"Roguestoney","date":"2017-02-11T12:24:08.643+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":5,"body":"Idk why people are downvoting this.
