But you are saying 90%+ of your teammates are outmatched in everyway which, statistically, makes no sense at all. In a sample size of over 3000 games, that is borderline impossible. And if all of this is true, then how is it that you have a win rate higher than 50% for ranked games this season?\nFind someone you know who is competent to climb with and you'll have an easier time, but there are gonna be games where both of you are outclassed too.","replies":[{"poster":"Transcender","date":"2015-02-09T01:12:28.465+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Exactly my point, I calculated that without any win streak mmr bonus or other factors streak based factors, the amount of which I would have climbed given the rate of teammates at 20% unwinnable games I could have gone from bronze to diamond 6 times over with the points I would have won.\n\nThis is specifically why I have been posting this and trying to enquire about it to Riot for some time now as to why this is happening.

With basic game knowledge you can gank another lane at level 6 and nearly always secure a kill.\n\nIf you're set on playing AD Carry, though, get onto champions like Ashe or Sivir or something else with high kill potential at level 6+. Either duo with a jungler or support main and hard farm until 10-15 minutes in then call the jungler bot kill the enemy bot lane and the turret then go dragon then back then siege mid.\n\nThis will set your whole team up very well coming into mid game and give them incentive to stick together as a team and try to snowball their advantage.\n\nI used this exact strategy back in Season 3 to get from Bronze III to Silver III using only Annie and Quinn.","replies":[{"poster":"Transcender","date":"2015-02-10T06:59:33.800+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"This game is a team game, I have tried every champion I own every possible way of carrying, the common factor stopping my progress is my teammates do not realise how badly they are hindering my ability to carry.
