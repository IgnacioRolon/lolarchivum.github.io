If you want to join this team you have to trust what I am asking from you even if you do not agree with it. I will explain it all in depth if you want me to. We are going to be playing every night when possible from 5pm (sydney time) til late.\n\nThere is no rank requirements but you must have a mic and the ability to use teamspeak.

I understand that due to the social and community standard that it would seem impossible to get that from a silver leader but I have already given information which negates those beliefs. Basically if something can happen no matter how it may seem at the time it can happen as long as it has what it needs to make it able to occur.","replies":[{"poster":"Wumachine","date":"2015-01-29T07:34:27.421+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"get diamond then talk about \"playing professionally\"","replies":[{"poster":"Transcender","date":"2015-01-29T08:52:32.569+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"I am not going to repeat myself from others threads, it is purely up to the players who see this thread whether or not they want to take a chance with playing for my team.","replies":[{"poster":"Wumachine","date":"2015-01-29T09:03:40.498+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"i'm going to break out the harsh truth to you, no one will want to join your team because:\n\n1) You're taking command and forcing people to do things that YOU want and forcing them to play champs that YOU chose \n2) No one wants to go pro with a silver 'leader'\n3) You're silver\n4) Your troll 'comps' are stupid and and will never work vs a meta team\n\n{{champion:26}} {{champion:25}} {{champion:3}} {{champion:29}} {{champion:10}}  Looks just like a cluster%%%% of champions with absolutely no synergy that  a few  level 10 players chose.....","replies":[{"poster":"Transcender","date":"2015-01-30T01:10:42.547+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I know everyone thinks its troll, we have a positive win/loss ratio and we have been using trialers the whole time so we have never had a chance to get a full team together to practice it and use it properly.","replies":[{"poster":"Istehz","date":"2015-01-30T02:45:13.545+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"When you play solo duo and want to win you want to be playing your best champion so why do you make people play champions that you like/think would be a team comp.\n\nA good team comp would be but these could be champions that no one in your team is familiar with so you should re make your thread and say something like this\n\nGnar\nOrianna\nLee Sin             \nThresh\nGraves\n\nor\n\nLissandra\nYasuo\nJ4\nLeona\nCorki\n\nYou should re make your thread and say something like this\n\nTranscendent is looking for players\n\nWe are currently unranked and need to feel all positions, we will be using (what ever voice chat) and practicing every day if possible.\n\nWe currently have\n\nIn Top\nMe WhitePumah in Mid lane\nIn Jungle\nIn Adc\nIn Support\n\nIf you could leave in the comments this. \n\nIGN:\nRANK:\nFAV ROLE:\nAGE:\nVOICE CHAT:\nTIME AVAILABLE:","replies":[{"poster":"Transcender","date":"2015-01-30T04:57:16.742+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"OR, i could make my thread as to accurately describe what is going to happen in the team so people dont waste their time trialing in a team they cant handle playing in.
