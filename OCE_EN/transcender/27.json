You could email through support, but they'll tell you the same thing as anyone asking about jobs. They don't do volunteer anything regarding the actual game, there's way too much sensitive info there for them to not train and pay you, at which point you're looking for jobs in that area, at which point the pathway is to make yourself visible and apply when something comes up.","replies":[{"poster":"Transcender","date":"2018-07-25T10:02:50.708+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hmm that is a shame, the game would be dead before I got into the position relevant for being able to take action to make a change.\n\nOh well, it will just take an extra 100 generations to make the same intellectual progress as the solution I could manufacture would.\n\nGGWP","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Transcender","date":"2018-07-24T10:20:46.440+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"http://voyagemia.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/Gatling_gun_salesman_cartoon.gif\n\nExcept I'm giving this away for free","replies":[]},{"poster":"Transcender","date":"2018-07-24T04:12:56.149+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I am not looking for employment, or for a support position.\n\nNo I have not seen what they say at all.\n\nThey really need someone as a ranked system analyst to implement the correct solutions in place, or this game will turn to dust really fast and I am willing to prevent that for free.","replies":[]}]}]}
