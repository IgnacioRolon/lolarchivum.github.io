As you stated, league is a team game. A group of 5 average players working well together will generally beat a team consisting of a couple of high skilled and low skilled players that are not communicating or are flaming. \n\nTo encourage the \"team dynamic\" of the game, Riot implemented dynamic queue. Allowing players to team up with however many friends they wished and to play competitively in the ranked system. The further encourage people to play together in teams with incentives such as extra IP, extra mastery points and hex tech stuff. On top of this, playing in an organised team is way more fun, and way less toxic. The only \"downside\" is that you will be against premade enemies and that games will be a bit harder (but if you want to get better, this is how you do it).\n\nThe issue with basing LP gain on the grading system, is that it would probably create an environment that is way too competitive in the team (as more people will be actively trying to KS or afk farm for the high grades). It also makes players more conscious of only looking out for themselves and their own scores and the whole \"teamwork\" thing would suffer.\n\n[I would suggest creating a team so you can work together and climb together.](http://boards.oce.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/team-recruitment) (I am very aware that you try creating a team every season, and would suggest you be more chillax in your leadership position in order to attract and keep players).","replies":[{"poster":"Transcender","date":"2016-03-24T07:31:06.280+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"why would i want to keep bad players?\n\nThe current environment is taking everything for yourself in order to try carry your team.

We need to differentiate between your **true skill** (which we will call \"_impact points_\") and your **estimated skill** (which we will call \"_matchmaking points_\"). **Matchmaking points** are used to decide who to match you against. So if your **matchmaking points** = 20 then ranked will try and match you with players who on average will also be at 20.\n\nBut let's say that, as you suspect, your real skill is higher than that. So your **impact points** (your impact on the game) is higher than 20. Let's say it is 30. So you will win more games than the system expects. So it will increase your matchmaking points to 21 and see how that goes. You still win more games, so it will keep increasing your points and eventually you should win as many games as you lose. Well, it might arc you above that but you should fall to that point.\n\nIt's a clever system that Elo invented, but one dumb thing about it is ultimately it is attempting to make the outcome of your games a coin flip :)","replies":[{"poster":"Transcender","date":"2016-03-26T08:25:31.379+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"\"ultimately it is attempting to make the outcome of your games a coin flip :)\"\n\n\nThis is the very thing I am trying to point out to everyone AND the very thing I am begging to be changed.

Currently any system that rates your solo performance in a team game is better than randoms being the major impact on results that are supposedly the players ability to play.\n\nWell, the problem there for multiplayer with humans on both sides is that a system that improved your chance to win would do so by decreasing someone else's chances. Say for example it was tuned so that your **matchmaking points** would stay below your **impact points**: meaning you can be predicted to win more often... at the cost of more losses to those poor players below your skill level who are forced to face you.\n\nThe mitigating factors are that for one thing the arc of your improvement via practice will be long, and for another the skill you turn up with on the day will always differ from your expected skill. Sometimes you'll play out of your skin. Other times you'll under-perform.\n\nFWIW the way to manage the system is to practice outside of ranked or with another account. Then your gains in true skill won't be known by the system. So you will be matched against players below your skill level based on **matchmaking points **that are out of date (due to your extra curricular practice).","replies":[{"poster":"Transcender","date":"2016-03-27T06:10:06.479+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"So basically you are telling me I should be more consistent and to get better.\n\nThat I was bad before and that is why I am still in low elo.\n\nThat the longer you play on an account for, the harder the games are meant to be for that account, and the key is to play on a different account and get better before you play on the main account?\n\nCause if that is true that would explain why people get a new account and go unranked to diamond in 100 games.\n[\nMe at season 3](http://i.imgur.com/Y1zxe0R.jpg)\n\n[Me now](http://oce.op.gg/summoner/userName=whitepumah)","replies":[{"poster":"vonklaude","date":"2016-03-28T03:10:04.027+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=whitePumah,realm=OCE,application-id=FjGAIbRv,discussion-id=1ErgEln1,comment-id=000200000000000000000001000000000000,timestamp=2016-03-27T06:10:06.479+0000)\n>\n> So basically you are telling me I should be more consistent and to get better.\n> \n> That I was bad before and that is why I am still in low elo.\n> \n> That the longer you play on an account for, the harder the games are meant to be for that account, and the key is to play on a different account and get better before you play on the main account?\n> \n> Cause if that is true that would explain why people get a new account and go unranked to diamond in 100 games.\n> [\n> Me at season 3](http://i.imgur.com/Y1zxe0R.jpg)\n> \n> [Me now](http://oce.op.gg/summoner/userName=whitepumah)\n\nI guess I'm not trying to advise, but rather describe the system as I understand it. It relies on receiving data points (each time you finish a game) to update its estimate. So if you deny it those data points while you are practising then its estimate will remain static while your ability improves. Therefore its estimate will be wrong (too low) and it will mismatch you. Therefore your win rate will increase for awhile as you are matched against players below your true skill.\n\nAnother important factor is that the system is designed to try and home in on your true skill as fast as possible. So when it first sees a player it gives them a lot of points per win/loss. Because by doing that it can quickly test where they sit. As its confidence improves (it homes in on their true skill) it will give fewer points per win loss. You can take advantage of that new-player swing with a new account: **starting a new account makes sense**.\n\nBut I think if I was advising, I'd point out that the way practice works is something like this\n\n1. You will see quick gains in the first stages of practice, then it will take more effort to make each further gain. You can exploit that by deliberately varying what you practice: becoming good at every aspect of the game rather than grinding away at just one aspect of it.\n\n2. Improvement isn't a smooth trajectory: at some points you will see quantum jumps to a new plateau of ability. Graphed, it looks something like an initially steep curve up (early practice) flattening out (grind) then a hop up to a new plateau. You can exploit this by begging for games with people that have already made that jump. Playing with them will help you make it yourself.\n\n3. A really hard thing to do is continue taking risks to learn new things. What happens is people find a strategy that they have initial success with, and stick to it because it generally works for them. What happens is that following that strategy will carry them so far and then they will plateau. Out of fear they will reject trying new things - too risky! You have to force yourself to break old habits and try a new way. You can get ideas for what new ways will be productive by watching other people. Or by just forcing yourself to play a new role, or do something you don't do much. If you follow the plan of having two accounts, you can make one your take-risks-and-try-stuff account and the other your serious (both ranked).\n\nHope this makes some difference. I'm very low ranked myself and in that respect I can point out that as you age, your skill at League will fall off. That tracks with the graph for human cognitive development: over about 25 you plateau and then for most cognitive functions you decline. League demands attention, processing speed and visuospatial ability: those all decline with age.","replies":[{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2016-03-28T04:01:52.554+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Oh I wholeheartedly agree. Even if you are refusing to practice in normals, when ranked becomes more about improving, and less about winning you see a significant improvement. \n\nTake as an example active items. For the longest time, I was total trash at remembering to use them, with the exception of something like Hydra which is up every 10 seconds and just becomes part of the combo. I was still winning games though so I didn't bother with them. I'd have items like Zhonya's or BotRK and never actually use them. \n\nEventually I said you know what, I can do this better, why aren't I? So for a few games, I just constantly reminded myself to use my actives. That's all those few games were about for me. It wasn't about winning or playing well it was about remembering to use my damn actives. And after just a couple games of breaking that habit and being rewarded for it, I was using actives pretty reliably. Now I actually remember to use them almost all the time (yay me!).\n\nIt was the same with using portraits for things like heals/shields, for placing wards, for placing pink wards and for self cast (still working on that one) with Alt+Q/W/E/R. \n\nDoing the same thing over and over and expecting a different result is pretty silly. If you want to get better you have to reinforce the good habits and break the bad ones, and attitude plays a massive part in that. You have to WANT to change something before it becomes even remotely possible.\n\n_________\n\nThinking \"I'm good enough to get out of Bronze\" is pretty shortsighted and not the right attitude to have. Rather you need to think \"What could I have done better?\". There is only one constant from game to game and that is ourselves, so if we can't carry a shit team hard enough, if we can't force knowledge and experience down our teams throats in the span of 20-50 mins then _**what CAN we change?**_\n\nThe answer is US. We can change the way we play. Even if it seems like something small or insignificant, finding something that you did wrong or that you could do better and fixing it gives you a finite and very visible improvement.\n\nWe go on and on about how attitude is so important in climbing with out fancy green names but perhaps there is a reason for it? If you stop focusing on the actions of others which you CAN'T change, and getting tilted by them, and instead focus on our own actions which we CAN change/improve, then even if we don't make it out of x div we'll be seeing an improvement in our skill.\n\nIf you think \"I'm good enough to get out of Bronze\" well ok. You make it to S5 but then? Guess what, now you're stuck in Silver. Climbing in ranked requires winning, but winning requires improvement. You can't expect to win without improving or you won't get very far at all.\n___\n**tl;dr If you want to get anywhere in ranked then you need to focus on IMPROVING rather than WINNING.

[http://www.lolskill.net/top/most-games?filterChampion=29&filterRealm=\n](http://www.lolskill.net/top/most-games?filterChampion=29&filterRealm=)\n\nin 200 games, I could only climb 1 league and I struggled doing that.\n\nI currently have a 59% win rate with twitch.\n\nTell me how much impact points I have, and how much I should have climbed from it. Keep in mind you can't use how much I have a climbed as an indicator for my impact points.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"PubgamerAU","date":"2016-03-26T06:07:29.099+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I mostly agree with you, however:\n\n>A group of 5 average players working well together will generally beat a team consisting of a couple of high skilled and low skilled players that are not communicating or are flaming.\n\nNo, lol. High skilled players carry games, regardless of flaming or communicating. This has been shown consistently by players that drop to bronze intentionally then carry themselves right back out.","replies":[{"poster":"Transcender","date":"2016-03-29T15:44:36.695+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"What happens when they get CC'd?","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Omni Presents","date":"2016-03-28T00:48:58.104+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I have been stating this for along time now, but it won't change anytime soon unless we get more players, a lot more players asking for it.\n\nCurrently due to how the high ranked players are doing, joining premades and actually getting results based on team play, the lower ranked players just follow suite. And if you don't join a team well, you, like myself and many others, can suck eggs.\n\nIt is blatantly unfair for us in the lower ranks who have to deal with the worst of the worst and no matter how well we play, find ourselves in games that just can't be won because we refuse to join as a premade.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Yasei Doubutsu","date":"2016-03-24T04:51:11.134+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"When new players first reach lvl 30, they have to play promo games.\ntheir first 10 ranked games.\n\nEven tho this is silly and I feel like the ranked restriction should actually have a minimum of normal wins to do.\nIf they are decent at the game they will win most of their games, if not lose most.\nAnd be placed accordingly.\n\nNow, some people learn a lot faster then others.\nSome take forever to learn anything.\nTheir is no system in the world that can judge on how quickly someone learns.\n\nYou play a game match with up to 4 randoms on your side and 5 randoms on the opposing side.\n\"League is a team game but you not the team\" - No if you are 1 in a team you are still the team.\nAll sports including soccer, football, rugby, basketball have a their own group performance.\nWhich decides on how the team moves and acts (Yes they know each other and are not randoms)\nBut its the same as street version of these sports.\nYou take 10 random people together and play a game of soccer.\n1 team might have 1 guy that's never played before, so they either ignore him or help him understand the rules.\nthe other team might have a \"Ball hogger\" who always takes the ball and tries to play the game solo.\n\nWin or lose, both teams will be decided and measured on who won and who lost.\nPreferably, they might decide that someone needs more practice.\nOr is better on the Left/Right fields, or is better on the center/Mid fields.\n\n----------------\n\nIn league you need to have the adaptability to be what your team needs.\nLets say, that you are the only one on your team that has a brain or actually has played thousands of games and etc.\nAnd all 4 of your team mates are brand new, just hit lvl 30.\n\nAnd lets say the enemy team is mixed up of Bronze 3 players to Silver 4.\n\nIt doesn't matter what role you get/are.\nIts now your job to help 4 people, This could seem like a drag but guess what its a Team Game.
