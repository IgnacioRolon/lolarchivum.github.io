That is an insane amount of people purposely trying to lose ranked games. Out of 3000 games at least 90% of those go through several surrender votes.\r\n\r\nI highly suggest to riot that either this becomes a unanimous vote in order to initiate the surrender or take out surrendering completely. If I had accepted every surrender vote I would have NEGATIVE mmr right now and that shouldn't be possible for someone attempting to play this game professionally.\r\n\r\nI have posted on a similar matter to this one regarding my solo queue matchmaking experience and I have got almost no assistance from riot previously except for one riot staff member (Riot Cochese) who was unable to help me due to being in a different area of expertise. I have also submitted a support ticket which gave me absolutely no help whatsoever.\r\n\r\nIf I do not receive personal help for this then at least look deeper into the surrender vote system.","replies":[{"poster":"csm","date":"2015-02-26T07:49:41.329+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"Yep, it really sucks when you aren't really that far behind, and one good team fight could literally put you in the lead, and your team just surrenders.
