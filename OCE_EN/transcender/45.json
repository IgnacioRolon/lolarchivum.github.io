I have got myself out of bronze to silver 3 times now, so if I didn't have these bad teams or this mmr decay I calculated that I would be around diamond-challenger by now (instead of bronze 3). So you guys might want to get your stuff together because its impacting a lot of potential in the OCE scene.","replies":[{"poster":"HORSE OF FORCE","date":"2015-01-29T03:33:47.911+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":">Is the reason for the lack of issues being solved due to lack of staff or just not giving a damn about peoples direct game problems?\n\nI'd say lack of staff/organisation.\n\nAt least we have OCE, be thankful for that.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Dengpao","date":"2015-01-29T02:36:03.270+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Get good and play better, this is oce, the home of trolls and afks.
