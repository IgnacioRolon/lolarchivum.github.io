Here is what you are not being told and shown.\n\nI manually input all of this info of every single random teammate in each ranked solo game over 3 different accounts. I compared the random teammates of Apdo&#039;s games to the randoms that I had in my own games and averaged the total kda of every random that each account played with.\n\nHere is the spreadsheet I whipped up: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1iIK7KBC1wM0qL24zMxIcZ1-hxfHwMtrV7b9ltgbfy9g/edit?usp=sharing\nFeel free to check my work\n\nAs you can see, the random teammates that Apdo was given on average performed pretty damn well, I do not believe Apdo played support in any one of these games, so 1/4 of his teammates played as support, which usually have low kills medium deaths and high assists, which would lower the average Kills to deaths ratio. Despite this disadvantage of his teammates KDA potential being lower due to supports usual kda ratio, all of his teammates pulled out on average, 36% more kills than they had deaths.\n\nWith these teammates he achieved a 100% winrate over 45 games. Despite not performing in every game he still won them all.\n\nI made my own smurf account to test out whether or not a different account puts you on the better team more often. With only having played the 10 placement game so far, the average kda of my teammates was only 5% more kills than deaths. I ended up with a 70% win rate.\n\nOn my main account however, in my ranked solo games I only ended up with a 44% win rate over 52 games despite a positive kda on average.\n\nSure enough, when I averaged up all of the KDA of each random teammate, they had 18% more deaths on average than they had kills.\n\nOn both my accounts I have almost **the same KDA**, one with a 70% win rate, and one with a 44% win rate.\n\nNo personal scores were apart of the teammates KDA.\n\nThe end result is Apdo&#039;s account was given 36% better teammates than the average and managed to achieve a 100% winrate.\nThe whitepuma account was given 5% better teammates than the average and managed to achieve a 70% winrate.\nThe whitepumah account was given 18% worse teammates than the average and only achieved a 44% winrate.\n\nI understand that KDA does not equal the result of each game, but based on these statistics, it paints a pretty clear picture as to how KDA of 80% of the team directly relates to the winrate on each account.","replies":[{"poster":"Anıma","date":"2017-01-27T00:34:19.861+0000","up_votes":9,"down_votes":0,"body":"We meet again my old friend. \n\nI can understand how your statistics can seem like they perfectly prove your point but if you take the time to think about it without any bias then you would realise there are other factors in play. I was going through the statistics and your graph for a while since it's quite interesting but I do still believe that you aren't thinking about this in a non-biased manner. You seem to be looking for something to prove you right, rather than prove you wrong which you should strive for.\n\n>Despite this disadvantage of his teammates KDA potential being lower due to supports usual kda ratio, all of his teammates pulled out on average, 36% more kills than they had deaths.\nWith these teammates he achieved a 100% winrate over 45 games. Despite not performing in every game he still won them all.\n\nThere are some important differences to consider. \n\nApdo's division was high gold > low plat = teams and enemy higher skill (less deaths avg)\n\nWhitepuma's division was silver I ish\n\nWhitepumah's division was silver IV ish \n\nApdo mains MID\n\nThe other 2 main ADC\n\nNow his teammates played better than yours did... why? I have answers.\n\nFor one he plays mid lane and that is a role that can impact the game more than ADC. He can invade, roam and solo the enemy laner whilst being able to get better vision down (enemy jg camps) support his jungler and generally be more of a menace than an ADC would. There were some jungle games as well but that is arguably the best carry role at least in higher divisions. ADC CAN CARRY but it does become more difficult unless you are very good and creating leads and carrying teamfights which anyone less than diamond would not be able to do well.\n\n\nThe reason why Apdo's team played better than yours is because he helped them. He warded, a lot. He can roam to help all lanes AND jungler and he can provide massive pressure and be able to rely on his godlike decision making to help him in any bad spot he is in (3v1 etc). His most played champion by far is Corki who has insane poke and can roam VERY well especially with things like Package. He would ping a lot and something that you can't do which he does is if he ever gets leads, he doesn't often die. If you are ahead the worst thing you can possibly do is die. You give them some of your massive chunk of EXP and gold. Your KDA's on WhitePuma AND WhitePumah were both less than 3. Frankly that's horrid.\n\n**You can get ALLLLLLLLLLLLLLLL the kills you want but if you feed them back every single game your teams gonna have a fucking hard time.**\n\nLook down your champions, most KDA's are laughable and the ones that aren't are 1-2 games played. Apdo's KDA's are enough to get a hardcore LoL player off tbh. I guarantee you don't ping enough. You die like you were born to do it and you feed back all the kills you get in gold and experience. You don't know when to go to take objectives like Baron, Dragon or even turrets. You don't know HOW and WHEN to lane swap and WHY you do it. You don't know how to itemise or build your champion. You don't know how to carry games and you have the strongest case of the Dunning-Kruger effect I've ever fucking seen and my ex was a shocker let me tell you but damn.\n\nHis teams are better because he is better and provides for them. His pinging, csing, warding and knowledge of EVERYTHING incl small things you've probably never thought of like positioning in laning phase and being able to accurately predict the game. He won't let his bot die for free. He won't feed back his 4 level EXP lead and Legendary shut down gold. YOU WOULD. Your KDA's show it. \n\nYour team has to verse stronger enemies than his team's do because you are fucking terrible at knowing how to control the game and what to do with a lead and you die. YOU LITERALLY AVERAGE 5.0 MORE DEATHS A GAME THAN HIM AND YOU COMPLAIN THAT YOUR TEAM DOES 30% WORSE.\n\nwhitepuma having a higher win % than whitepumah even though teams are a bit better is because of 1 of a couple of reasons. You're playing against worse people who can't abuse your shitty positioning and knowledge thus you don't die thus your team has an easier time. You're lucky, yeah, lucky. Win streaks and lose streaks are a thing IF YOU AREN'T SMURFING but I don't know the people you versed in provs with it so I had to add that as an option. You give me a level 30 bronze account and I tryhard on it and my teams will be 50% better than yours or w/e cause I won't die. I will ping and I will set up my team for victory, something you can't do.\n\nAs a side note, there were no real games Apdo didn't perform well. Only 2 games were average (by his standard) but he still had great CSPM, lower deaths than you and warded like a season 3 jungler (a lot) + his damage was the highest in the game by far.","replies":[{"poster":"Transcender","date":"2017-01-27T07:20:08.514+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":4,"body":"Come back to me when you can provide facts, not assumptions.\n\nI put in the effort to provide statistics, and all I ever get met with is being told I am wrong without ever being shown WHY I am wrong.\n\nI am open to being shown exactly how apdo manipulates his teammates into winning their lane without being anywhere near it.

It's all well and good for you to kill four of them and then die, but if the one you leave alive can then ace your team, it doesn't really work in your favour. Ofc ADC only has so much control over this, but even just your life or death can have a massive impact on a game, and some deaths can mean a lost game. Without watching your replays, I don't know how much of this is relevant.\n\nVision and map awareness are probably the biggest things that people insist they are good at, and hate on people for being bad at, but often gets lost at points of the game, especially fights. Doesn't matter how good your map awareness CAN be if it isn't consistent. You have to remember that even in fights you have to be aware of your surroundings, and vision this is obviously key to knowing that. I don't think there's ever a game when someone couldn't have done map awareness better, no matter how high you go.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Aegis EnGarde","date":"2017-01-25T23:25:04.275+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> I understand that KDA does not equal the result of each game, but based on these statistics, it paints a pretty clear picture as to how KDA of 80% of the team directly relates to the winrate on each account.\n\nYou know that Apdo probably had something to do with his teammates' KDA, right?\nJust compare your KDA to his, you'll notice a huge difference.","replies":[{"poster":"Transcender","date":"2017-01-26T00:09:05.659+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Aegis EnGarde,realm=NA,application-id=FjGAIbRv,discussion-id=liHY5B94,comment-id=0000,timestamp=2017-01-25T23:25:04.275+0000)\n>\n> You know that Apdo probably had something to do with his teammates&#x27; KDA, right?\n> Just compare your KDA to his, you&#x27;ll notice a huge difference.\n\nWhat about his teammates having something to do with his KDA?\n\nEspecially since there is 4 of them and only 1 of him, it would make more sense that they impact his KDA more than he impacts theirs.\n\nEveryone seems to have a rather biased outlook on this instead of looking at every factor.

You actually have Silver MMR so if you lose more and drop to Gold 5, there's a serious possibility that you'll be demoted to SIlver.

Is this because the server cannot handle 2 queues at the same time?\nI still think at each end of the elo (mmr) spectrum there are many abnormalities. For example for matchmaking in flex queue, you'll see one team have a bunch of (soloqueue ranked) bronzers and another have a bunch of soloqueue ranked bronzers with the odd gold thrown in. Flex queue possibly does not take into account soloqueue rank, and so newbies to flex that are gold in soloqueue but got placed lowly in flex queue will still be paired with bronze veterans.
