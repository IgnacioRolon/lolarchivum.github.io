E.g when you argued with me about Apdo that one time awhile ago or something around that time.","replies":[{"poster":"Transcender","date":"2017-07-07T09:07:44.220+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"Yeah, the problem is I have had tons of experience with playing these setups and I know its possibilities way better than anyone in this entire game. People are arguing against something they have next to no experience with so naturally I am not inclined to blindly believe INSANELY biased perspectives due to almost no experience and it is clear that they have no experience by the examples of the \"flaws\" it has like \"what happens when zilean goes up against X champion, he is obviously screwed then\".\n\nWhen people actually try to find out more about the team comp by asking me questions I can literally explain everything and then they acknowledge its potential. Most people have a lot of questions as well, so telling me everyone understands it all, let alone better than me when I have had like 1000's of hours more experience than anyone with my setups is a bit hopeful to say the least. It is like having thousands of players who had been playing runescape come up to you and be like, \"you guys are playing it wrong, soraka is meant to deal damage as ad carry and draven is meant to be support, noobs.\"","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Roguestoney","date":"2017-07-07T00:19:30.777+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"You ain't gonna trick me sir.
