Those are the sorts of changes you bring everyone right back to the lower rank to be on a more even playing field. Changes of information that Riot literally hands out to the public for viewing does not justify manipulation of the rankings. If players do not read the patch notes they will be the ones who drop in rank as their lack of the new game knowledge will cause them to fail more often, those who did read the patch notes will be just as prepared as they were previously.\n\nThere is nothing more demoralizing that losing what you have worked stupidly hard to achieve, EVERY SINGLE SEASON.","replies":[{"poster":"Nightjar","date":"2016-12-07T11:47:21.376+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"to put it in a more direct way, the rank reset gives players more incentive to play ranked since they want to climb to the rank they were before the reset or higher and it gives hope to those stuck in the bottom of bronze mmr.

Not luck or teammates.\n\nFirst of all just because you are the only person in every one of your games does not mean you are the only one who affects them. You will always have 4 teammates to play against and 5 enemies to play with. If you think that only constant variables affect your rank, then think about this. Only your performance affects your rank, which is not a constant variable, your performance will change every game, and your teammates performance will change every game, and your enemies performance will change every game. If you continue on this logic then nothing actually affects your rank.

I understand that if you are better than you have a slightly higher chance for your whole team to be better than their team including yourself. All that matters is whether or not the enemy team performs better overall than your team.\n\nLet me give you another perspective.

It doesn’t prove what you think it does. You’re comparing the stats of your gold team mates to the stats of Korean challenger players. To do this properly you would compare the stats of your gold team mates with the overall stats of players in OCE Gold. Comparing the statistics of Korean Challenger players to OCE Gold players only proves Korean challenger players are better, which we already knew. The other reason you need to use an average of all OCE Gold players instead of APDO’s team mates is to take ADPO out of the mix. He’s considered to be one of the best players in the world and makes his teammates better through his play. If you did this that would prove how your teams ranked compared to the average OCE gold player. Then if they ranked substantially worse you might have a case. If you wanted to be through you could even compare your team mates against the average stats of OCE players in general. And before you say it, APDO was not Challenger because he had better team mates, his team mates were better because he was challenger, just like his opponents were. Michael Jordan didn't make it in the NBA because he had better team mates, he had better team mates because he was in the NBA. He also had better opponents, just like APDO.\n \nEven then that would only prove so much, KDA is not everything in League of Legends. Someone with a 75% win rate could end with a bad KDA through your team getting stomped and show up as a bad team mate. Even if he played well during the game.\n \nThat is why large sample size matters over time each individual game performance forms a pattern. Tom Brady and Michael Jordan are considered the Greatest of All Time in there sports because of their play over a number of years. They’ve had terrible performances and great ones but overall there ability was beyond world class. The same applies to you, you might have bad games and you might have fantastic games but over the thousands of games you’ve played the level you’re at shines through.\n \nThat is not how anything works. Just because you are 20% of your team doesn’t mean your rank is 20% accurate. The whole point of large sample sizes is to even out the performances of the other variables so that your performances shine though. Faker is only 20% of his team but his rank is damn sure 100% correct.","replies":[{"poster":"Transcender","date":"2018-01-17T08:34:14.399+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"I am not sure you understand the purpose of the spreadsheet.

The difference is, his teammates can be helped, they understand why he is there, they do not misunderstand his purpose there, where as mine do.\n\nKDA isn't everything but as you can see by the statistics, at least 90% of the games outcomes correlate to the scores of the players.","replies":[{"poster":"Mozzie25","date":"2018-01-17T10:35:33.209+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"No your not.

You have no control group, you have not listed any assumptions made, you have no data on the other teams or game length or gold and damage per team mate. But the biggest mistake is the failure to account for the difference between challenger games and gold games.

I'm watching a Pro game right now and its 25 minutes in and theirs been a total of 3 kills over both teams and despite that one team has a 3k gold lead. Seeing a stat line like that would be incredibly rare in OCE gold. You can't compare challenger team mates and gold team mates because the way the games is played between the two levels is different. All you have is some KDA averages. \n\nAnd you know what I see in those averages?\n\nYour team mates are closer in average to the Korean Challenger players than you are to APDO. \n\nAll that spreadsheet proves is that you don't know shit about statistics.","replies":[{"poster":"Mozzie25","date":"2018-01-18T23:59:51.652+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Correct however it is convenient short hand for the Korean Region and it is entirely acceptable to call the regions by their leagues.\n \nBecause that’s what you are doing. It doesn’t matter if they are playing against opponents of the same skill level the stats aregoing to be different. Challenger players will always have different KDA’s to gold players because the play at their level is better. Yes a 2.0 KDA at challenger is the same as a 2.0 KDA at gold. However due to the fact there challenger there likely to have better overall KDA’s that’s the damn point. I’ll give you an example, an NBL (Australia’s Basketball League) player is always going to have different stats to an NBA (Americans Basketball League) player. Yes they both can score 20 points and yes they are playing against players of similar skill levels but the stats in the games are different. Because the NBA is so much better than the NBL which is the same problem comparing gold players and challenger players. \n \nNowhere in that spread sheet did you break down the KDA tothat level, it was always 5/3/6 your just making shit up now. You’re justcomparing KDA to KDA. If you broke down KDA to that level IE the above scorewould be 3.0, it would be better. However my point is that by comparingdifferent ranks, that difference could be the reason for the differences in KDA you find. The rank difference is a variable, and that variable stays even ifyou break down the KDA. The rank variable could and is likely to be the reasonfor any difference. \n \nNo where did you correlate the KDA of your team mates to the outcome of the game. You just listed KDA and win rates. Your spread sheet doesn’t prove anything. If you handed that over as “evidence” to prove your point atuniversity or in a business you’d get laughed out of the room. Again you’re pulling shit out of your arse, no where you show that “the outcome of the game is about 98% accurate to the expected outcome of a game based on the teams KDA”. In fact that statement doesn’t even make sense and that percentage is 100% fucking made up. \n \nNow this is where I know you’re not a scientist or a statistician.YOU DON’T GET TO DECIDE WHAT PEOPLE TAKE FROM YOUR SPREAD SHEET. A study should present its methods, assumptions and results and a well explained piece on why these results are statistically significant and back up your hypothesis. Youcan’t just wave around a spread sheet and tell everyone they need to see things your way. That’s why research papers are peer reviewed before they’re published. You present your results and your findings from those results butyou have to prove to your peers that they make sense. \n \nNo one is arguing that your team mates don’t have an effecton the game, what we are telling you is over time the effect of your team mates evens out and if you were good enough to climb you would. League is a game where you can straight up hard carry your team if you get a lead, so stop with this only 20% of the team bullshit. If I put Faker in a bronze OCE game he might be only 20% of the team but he will definitely have more than a 20% impact on the outcome of the game. \n \nWhy would I go to all that effort when you have nothing to disprove.That spreadsheet doesn’t prove anything!! Not to mention given your failure tounderstand basic scientific method and the basis of statistics you would dismiss anything I gave you out of hand.

If you were comparing Gold OCE KDA’s to LCK Challenger KDA’s at least you might have been able to note the level of difference between the two and APDO would be playing against opponents of similar skills. Instead you comparing a whole bunch of different leagues that might be worse or better than OCE Gold and APDO is playing against people he is much much better than. Of course his team mates are doing better, because APDO is slaughtering his lane the majority of games and knows the correct decisions to make.\n \nIt was 2 – 1 the team with the 3k gold lead had the 1 kill. Kills are not the only form of gold in League of Legends. In fact the higher you go the less gold in games comes from kills and more comes from CS and objectives.\n \nBut it completely misses all context.

That’s why statistical studies take so long and are so expensive. You need to gather the data, you can’t just get one side of the story and then decide to mirror the other off that one. We’ve all won games while down in kills compared to the enemy team. Your spreadsheet does nothing to take that possibility into account. A bad KDA does not necessarily indicate a bad team mate, alternatively a good KDA does not equal a good team mate. Correlation does not equal causation.\n \nBecause I enjoy watching League of Legends, maybe if you watched it from time to time you’d understand there’s a ton more to league than kills. Your correct solo queue and professional play are very different, however so is solo queue inside the different regions and the different ranks. You shouldn’t be trying to compare your team mates to theirs. I know you’re not trying to compare solo queue to LCS but my point is you might as well be. Low level Ranked is as different to Challenger as Solo Queue is to Professional Play, if not more.\n \nIn statistics you’re supposed to limit the number of variables that can have an effect on the result. You want to be doing your best to ensure if you find a difference it’s because of what you think. You have a whole bunch of variables interfering and the difference in those KDA’s could be due to any of them. For example the difference in APDO’s teammates could come from any of these variables and you have no way to prove it’s because your team mates were bad.\n                Different leagues – Gold compared to                                              silver/gold/plat\n                Different Region – OCE – LCK\n                APDO – APDO smurfing influences the results\n                Win Rate – He won 100% of his games therefore                          the score of his teams is likely to be better\n \nYou can’t compare the NA challenger to APDO’s for the same reasons. And how on earth is 4.5/4.3 = 4.5/3.3. That’s a huge difference right there. There was also a difference in assists 7.7 – 8.1 and a humongous difference in Win rate 100% - 60%. Any differences in the scores of the game are much more likely to come that difference in Win rate than the specific team mates.\n \nTo do this properly you need to compare your team mates KDA to the average KDA of an OCE Gold player and the games you take your team mates from have to be on a similar win rate as the average win rate for OCE Gold. Then and only then you will be able to compare your team mates. BUT even then it doesn’t tell the whole story because KDA is only a portion of the game. It would be much better with other stats like gold earned and damage done and taken; and to be through you should compare them at different win rates. Ideally you would also include the statistics from your opponents as well.\n \nThere is nothing to understand in that spread sheet, it’s just some averages. It doesn’t actually show anything.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Transcender","date":"2018-01-18T15:36:18.198+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Okay, first of all LCK is not a region, it is a championship.\n\nSecond of all, you seem to be stuck with the idea that I am comparing gold players to challengers.\n\nLet me simplify this with an example for you.\n\nIn a 1v1:\nGame 1(gold):\nPlayer A (gold) = 10 kills / 5 deaths\nPlayer B (gold) = 5 Kills / 10 deaths\n\nGame 2(challenger):\nPlayer C (challenger) = 6 kills / 3 death\nPlayer D (challenger) = 3 kill / 6 deaths\n\nOutcome:\n\nPlayer A (gold) = 2.00 KDA (expected winner)\nPlayer B (gold) = 0.50 KDA\n\nPlayer C (challenger) = 2.00 KDA (expected winner)\nPlayer B (challenger) = 0.50 KDA\n\nSummary:\nThe KDA is equivalent because they are the same relative skill level as their opponent. You will notice the challenger with a negative KDA does not have a KDA higher than the gold with a positive KDA because his **RELATIVE** performance is worse due to the opponent he is playing against.\n\nIt is purely to record the kda of the teammates I have had and other accounts have had and correlate the kda to the outcome of the game to display as evidence that the system that riot is using as matchmaking is flawed and very inaccurate. It actually disproves itself but everyone seems to blinded to see it. So I try to literally show people a more detailed unbiased set of data to show how the outcome of the game is about 98% accurate to the expected outcome of a game based on the teams kda.\n\nThe end result everyone SHOULD have gained from this is:\nThe teammates KDA has a very high correlation to the outcome of the game due to them being 80% of the team and therefore 4 players will have more affect on the 1 player than 1 player will have on the other 4.\n\nWhat I want to see is a hard reset instead of a false reset.\n\nIt looks like Riot is claiming to give lower level players a chance to climb while actually not resetting mmr at all which means the challenger players do not need anything higher than a 50% winrate to get back to the exact same spot they were in challenger the previous season.\n\nWhich either means Riot isn't as smart as they would like to be or they have purposely deceived everyone into trying to climb so that they play the game and make them more money. Essentially making Riot another money hungry, greedy business that is going to die the moment something better comes along rather than evolve to become better than whatever comes out next.\n\nOn another note if you want all of the data such as gold cs etc, then feel free to look those accounts up on opgg and look at the match history to find anything you want to try and disprove me, I beg you to try and prove these stats to be too inaccurate to use as evidence.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Transcender","date":"2018-01-17T11:43:23.114+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"You do realise that the only korean challenger player in that spreadsheet is Apdo?\n\nIn your \"pro game\" what is the score of the team with the gold lead?\n\nIf you go 0-5 the enemy team has 5 kills and your team has 5 deaths. You can extrapolate the missing data from the information given. Therefore it is relative based on the teammates kda that the enemy has gained the opposite kills deaths and assists from them.\n\nAlso why are you watching a pro game, that is an organised 5v5 with both teams having team chemistry and a game plan.

To ensure you actually deserved the rank you ended up on and it wasn’t the result of boosting or one of your main champions being overtuned that season. If you belong at gold and get reset into bronze and silver you will climb back up. Ranked play is a process just because your earned Gold last season does not mean you earned the right to stay there permanently.\n\n2. To partially re-set MMR based on how you performed. So if you’re winning a ton of games but not gaining ground because of your MMR the season reset would partially help with that.\n\n3. To ensure the ranks don’t stagnate and new players have a chance. If everyone stayed at their current ranks they would have a massive advantage over players just starting. One that would be very difficult to overcome, even now you have an advantage as it’s a soft reset not a hard one. Not to mention the bag log of players you’d get sitting in the 5th division of every rank surviving on the minimum number of games required to avoid being demoted by decay.\n\nAll in all the soft reset helps the health of the game. It ensures that you earn your rank each season instead of just inheriting it. For the last three season’s I’ve been placed in bronze 3 and climbed to bronze 1 or 2. Then I usually get deterred by how much of a hard slog ranked is and how much the games tend to take out of me (Normals are just so much more relaxing). Just because I made it to Bronze 1 once doesn’t mean I deserve to sit there forever. And if I manage to start climbing (fingers crossed) I’ll need to prove I earned that rank.","replies":[{"poster":"Transcender","date":"2018-01-17T01:11:30.404+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"Actually MMR can't be reset, the ranks can but the MMR can't be.
