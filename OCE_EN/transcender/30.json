Saying you wont lose any games below your rank is stupid because even challenger players who duo with another challenger player cannot hit challenger with above a 70% win rate consistently, thats with 2 players playing much below their level. \n\nHe did get very unlucky and yes he did lose the game. But playing this way he will still win 90% of all his games and easily climb very quickly.","replies":[{"poster":"Transcender","date":"2018-11-13T21:30:16.322+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Hawaii,realm=OCE,application-id=FjGAIbRv,discussion-id=MEc4UjEE,comment-id=0001,timestamp=2018-11-13T20:43:06.073+0000)\n>\n> I think this video does show that rank is pretty accurate\n\nWhat part?\n\nHis high amount of kills?\n\nThe enemy running into a fed darius 1 by 1?\n\nThe graph at the end?\n\nGotta give an explanation if you are going to make a statement, otherwise it has no value.","replies":[{"poster":"Hawaii","date":"2018-11-14T01:08:56.884+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Okay. I think the fact that he can perform extremely well and put his team in a position to possibly win despite it literally almost being a 1v9 shows that rank is in fact accurate and everyone saying they're stuck at their rank because of their teams are full of shit. \n\nHis high amount of kills? No. Kills are a result of his proper play, not something by itself that you can evaluate game play by. Hence- KDA means something, but that something is very little. \n\nThe enemy running into a fed darius 1 by 1? Its bronze 5. What did you expect? I could probably watch some of your games and make similar remarks like, \"You did well? Enemy isnt even building optimally? Theyre not even capitalizing on poor rotations? You won? Game took 40 minutes when your team was up 10k at 25 minutes\" etc. Thats a poor argument and it goes back to the idea of controlling what you can control. If this is what happens in low elo, then why doesnt everyone get this many kills every game? Why didnt the enemy have someone doing better than him? His team wasnt even trying, the whole enemy was. \n\nThe graph at the end? No, actually it did not even come to mind as I dont give a shit about stats. Stats are cool and all, but stats are a by-product of his game-play(obviously). If you watch games, you can see whether a player is making good decisions, be efficient, giving him team opportunities to succeed. \n\nThe way I look at this game is that it clearly shows that he was better than the opponent. Riot has said many times that it takes more than a few games to reach your proper rank. What are the chances that he has teammates like this again? Or that is isnt able to carry teammates again? Did he play perfectly? No. I think some of his decisions late game could have been better and given them a better chance to win, but he was right in many cases and made a risky assessment that mightve worked out and then we wouldnt even be having this conversation. This is all to say that there is nothing wrong with matchmaking. At the end of the day, league is a team game. You cannot win it on your own. But consistently playing at a level above your current rank will allow you to climb. The law of large numbers tells us that for every game you have a shitty teammate, in the long run, you will have just as many games against shitty opponents. You have to be the differnce maker. You can climb with a 50.00000000001% winrate easily. It just takes more games than someone with a 70% winrate. This video showed me that the system works, plain and simple. If you expect smurfs or even the top players to never lose in low elo then you just dont understand how this game works.","replies":[{"poster":"Transcender","date":"2018-11-14T03:28:24.889+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"This is a perfect opportunity for you to provide examples from the game so that people can know what to look for and then understand in their own game how they should be playing the same or similar situation.\n\nYou are telling me that these games are rare where your teammates feed and then try to lose on purpose to end the game quicker?\n\nI have been traumatized into duo queuing just so I don't get outvoted in the surrender votes and forced into losing a game we are ahead in.\n\nI noticed someone else on his team voted to not surrender. He should've lost the game right there on the spot.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}
