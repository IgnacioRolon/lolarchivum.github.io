Currently I am being told I am the only soldier in the war and if the war is won i get LP/MMR and if the war is lost i lose LP/MMR. If that sounds wrong then maybe the message being sent out about ranked has to be changed, or the actual results of the game have to be changed.\r\n\r\nI would recommend using the current grading system to determine point gain/loss while a better system is worked on.","replies":[]}
