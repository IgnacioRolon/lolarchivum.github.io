They give Pro Players Unranked accounts, but then tweak the MMR so that it is Diamond+ level. That way, they don't have to grind through 30 games of Gold and Plat, and can quickly get to the level where they are facing other Pros.\n\nRemember, they are overseas for a Pro tournament. Grinding through Silver, Gold, etc. isn't going to help them. They need to get up there with the other Pros as soon as possible.\n\nI hope this helps :D\n{{sticker:sg-ahri-2}}","replies":[{"poster":"Transcender","date":"2017-10-09T09:44:45.816+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thanks.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Outis","date":"2017-10-09T08:56:44.403+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"pretty sure they did. they and riot employees were given accounts with basically unlimited RP. \n\napparently it is no longer the case for riot employees so it may have changed for pro players also but don't know for sure.","replies":[]}]}
