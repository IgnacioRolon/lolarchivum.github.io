I see absolutely no reason as to why players would be getting demoted when they win more than half of their placements and get placed several divisions lower. It is not like it is a division or two and should be overlooked I have seen players including myself get dropped an entire league. Makes for some super hard climbing when it could possibly take a whole season to get out of a league simply due to bad luck, only to be dragged back down. I personally got dropped back in season 4 to 5, from silver 4 to bronze 4. I had never been below bronze 3 until the end of my placements which i won like 5/10. Based on how many leagues i have climbed i should be gold or plat but I and everyone else i have seen keeps getting dropped back heaps every start of season. I have yet to see someone end up above where they finished last season.\r\n\r\nPlease look into this.","replies":[]}
