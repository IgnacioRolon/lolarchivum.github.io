Main reasons were map pressure, trading, and the fact that the team composition is 80% AP (especially top half of the map). I would say that in the current meta this team composition would get stomped even quicker than back in those times.\nIts like going to war with the same strategy every time, despite what the enemies do... doomed to fail.\n\nBut the problem that you currently face is players taking orders... nobody likes that. If you can't convince players that this strategy will work, then its not gonna happen. Perhaps if you offered some incentives to some bronze-silver-golds to play this in flex queue they could try it out {{sticker:slayer-jinx-wink}} ","replies":[{"poster":"Transcender","date":"2017-06-29T14:39:32.176+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"Well the map pressure is lacking only in the early game, and we specifically have anti map pressure like zilean to go to whatever lane is being split pushed at the time.\n\nLack of trading is only a disadvantage if you are only stronger in the early game and are trying to win lane to make up for the mid-late game where you would otherwise fall behind.\n\nThe team composition being 80% ap is actually the solution to the problem of the enemy building heavy armour because twitch is doing insane amounts of damage. If they dont build the armour twitch alone will shred the entire team.\n\nMost enemies build either damage because they are winning lane so that must go really well right, because the meta tells them to, or they build 1 defensive item vs laner and the rest depending on how the game is going. If they go straight for the anti twitch and build heavy armour then they are going to end up struggling vs the ap champs. Kayle also reduces armour/mr with passive and amumu does max hp % magic damage.\n\nThe problem I face is that people not only do not like taking orders, but they seem to struggle with following it all correctly, as if they dont have it all clear in their mind. The other problem I face is who the foork even plays champions in the setups let alone the way they need to be played in the setup.\n\nThe compositions were never the bigger problem but the way players have to adjust so drastically from playing individually and trying to solo carry every game themselves like the meta suggests, to playing a more controlled timing based team comp that focuses more on mid-late game while sacrificing early game to do it. As a starcraft 2 zerg player who focuses on macro and prepares for mid-late game and scouting+defending all early agression, it comes easy to me to think this way and starcraft 2 (and 7 years of counter strike) has given me the mechanics to be able to execute what I would want other players to be able to. So what I perceive as easy for me, others are not even close to comfortable with.\n\nI knew this was a long shot from the start, but the potential rewards from it were too hard to pass up so I have been trying to grind away at it for years, training players up to play the style I need them to. I have even thought about playing with 2 mice with binds on them to control Q W E R A D F so I could support myself, but that in itself would be a monstrous task for myself to work towards which would probably take 5-10 years to develop to a point where it can be used in a tournament.\n\nInstead of attempting it, all I have got from the majority of this community is toxicity and abuse about how bad they all think it is. Probably because I have also come in and said all of your ranks which you believe you worked so hard to acquire were mostly not of your own input. So naturally instead of thinking what if he is right, maybe we should give him a chance to prove himself. I got nothing but everyone putting on their thornmails and trying to return damage back to me which was probably my own fault in the first place.\n\nI never actually intended to put anyone down or try to act superior, but from what I was experiencing, there was no way I was ever going to get anywhere playing solo queue and therefore I was never going to get a reputation for being respected as a high level player. So instead I had to try to get infamous to get any sort of potential acknowledgement. Which actually kinda worked because just recently, Vibes tried to put together a team of challengers to play my team comps and have me as the adc shot calling it. This was quite obviously an attempt to prove how bad they thought my strategy was, but while half of them quite blatantly trolled and the other half were unprepared but followed on as best as they could on the fly. I don't know this for sure but I think they might have started to realise the potential of the setup because they did not go any further with trialing to actually get it right.\n\nOther than that, 4 years and no results.\n\nSo I have been getting back into starcraft 2 recently where I don't have teammates so it is purely up to my own strategy and mechanics to determine my relative ability compared to others.","replies":[{"poster":"Main Line","date":"2017-06-29T14:59:38.653+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"After watching that video and reading this post the only conclusion that can be made is the Gold is definitely the new Bronze in OCE.\nTerrible lack of understanding of how the game works, really.

I have found some amazing things which I have tried to share, and only very recently is it starting to be explored like the master yi and kayle cheese combo. Now I had built an entire gameplan around that sort of style 4 years ago and I have many other team comps with similar team based dependencies. Individually, those champions are not as strong as meta champs, but paired together they are insanely stronger than meta comps.\n\nThis information is completely irrelevant to everyone though because humans apparently are perfect and can't be wrong about anything.","replies":[{"poster":"Anıma","date":"2017-06-30T04:42:09.439+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"A lot of the reason (myself included) that people don't even give you much of a chance anymore is because of your views and seemingly strong Dunning-Kruger effect. \n\nFor instance, you say that \"...all of your ranks which you believe you worked so hard to acquire were mostly not of your own input.\" You say this yet boosting exists. When pro players go to other regions for tournaments and such in 100 games they can get masters/chall easily (with high starting mmr to be fair, low platish probably). \n\nYou say things that simply aren't really true such as \"Well the map pressure is lacking only in the early game, and we specifically have anti map pressure like zilean to go to whatever lane is being split pushed at the time.\" Let's say you're versing a fairly popular split pusher such as a Fiora. You send Zilean to try and clear the waves or whatever and you get dove, you use your ult on yourself, then Fiora kills you when you respawn. In what world would Zilean be good in that scenario. If he verses someone less popular such as a Shen right, Shen will just ignore you and take turret. You try to double bomb him he will just e to dodge or sidestep. You try to ignore him and clear the wave he will simply engage on you and tanks like that have high enough base damage to kill you if you try to repeat that more than once. If for some reason you're fed and he can't kill you, he can bring _anyone_ else on his team and just kill you then.\n\nIf you play a very weak early game comp such as your comps are and your defense of it is \"just play defensively and wait for twitch to farm\" or something along those lines you can win some games, of course you can, but as soon as you verse anyone who's good at the game, they will ravage you. \n\nIf all 3 of your lanes are losing due to versing a good early game team and the enemy jungler makes your jungle his own, they will just snowball and win in 20~ minutes. If your jungler is a good duelist such as Shyvana, it doesn't mean shit. The opponents laners will always be able to roam faster than yours would and they will punish her. Their laners will shove in, ward the living shit out of your jungle and make sure most of Shyvanas camps are contested and she can't do anything but lose camps and get behind.\n\nYour entire team comp relies on Twitch becoming relevant, but what happens when your Twitch is 30 cs 10 minutes in because he can't farm. What happens if the enemy adc knows their wave management and keeps his wave his side of the map 80% of the time and zones you off not only cs, but experience. What happens if as soon as you step forward that little bit to try to hit level 5 when the enemy adc is already level 6 and the jungler ganks you and the enemy top tp's into your lane as the mid roams down to 5 man you and your early game is bad. What happens? You get absolutely massacred no matter what you try to do.  You can try to match the 5v5 but you're not an early game team and theirs is so rip you. They will be aware that all twitch wants to do is farm so they will do everything in their power to stop that from happening.\n\nThat is some of the reasons why people think your comp is bad. You might be able to pull this off against teams who aren't good or knowledgeable enough to know this or put this into action, but as soon as you do, you will fail, badly.\n\nWhen I versed you in open ladder with a relatively decent team who didn't actually think much about your comp who laughed at you when we saw you in brackets, we bet you in 28 minutes. 21-5 in kills.\n\nImagine versing a team who not only was decent like we were, but cared enough to try and counter your comps or whatever, you'd be devastated.\n\nThe point I'm trying to make is. What you say is stupid to most people, at least the ones who know the game well enough to debunk your stuff. Good on you for trying to find new things and such, but you seem so cocky, condescending and ignorant sometimes it's very difficult for people to take what new things you say seriously.","replies":[{"poster":"Transcender","date":"2017-06-30T05:59:49.934+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"The thing is everyone thinks they know how the game works regardless of if they actually have thought it all through or not.\n\nI have both experienced it THOROUGHLY and I have even posted videos detailing EXACTLY how it should be played out. Clearly you did not watch the videos because if you did without a biased perspective, you would realise that we have literally everything we need early game to defend against everything they could POSSIBLY throw at us.\n\nThere is a reason I have so many other team comps with similar playstyles because I have also planned ahead of the scenario where people actually realise how broken the comp really is and ban it out in tournaments.\n\nThere is a reason I am constantly looking for new players to test how well they can play out the team comps. I simply have not been confident in the players ability to execute the strategies.\n\nGive me a whole team who can play it to a minimum required standard and ONLY then can you dismiss it after you have seen the results of it.\n\nAll I have been asking is to be given that chance to prove it, regardless of how terribly stupid it looks to people. Once they start to ask questions about it and listen to my answers, they actually begin to start thinking that maybe this has been thought out properly and could work.\n\nI do want to seem cocky, because that shows I have strong confidence in what I am stating. Would you really consider what I am saying if I said I wasn't so sure if it was any good or not, and since you believe it is ridiculous in the first place that would give no challenge for you to acknowledge that there is a possibility and it might be worth looking into.\n\nSorry but you haven't the slightest clue about how the setup can play out against certain things, which is understandable because you have not experienced it as I have. The answer to this particular issue is you having an open inconclusive mind about things and only until you have solid proof that it can't be done better than you perceive it can you confidently state it to be true. I have not been able to test it against a team who has tried to counter it so despite my knowledge and tons of hours put into trying to think of a way to counter my own team comp, I cannot conclude that it will go as smoothly as I am suggesting, but I have a strong belief towards it based on calculations of my own game knowledge.\n\nTest thoroughly before concluding anything.

If my team could play the composition properly and hold until late. I've succeeded so many times with such strategies myself and had full faith that they would work but you seem to fail to understand how wrong you can be. There will always be another team of players, or team comp to knock you down. I played with teams and comps which I thought to be nearly perfect when I was more novice to professional play, but it took me versing OCS+ teams for me to realize how hilariously easy it is to be abused by players who know what they're doing. They could see holes I couldn't. You can't be so confident in something which hasn't been proven to work in a high level environment. If it can't work in a high level environment, there are problems which can be abused.
