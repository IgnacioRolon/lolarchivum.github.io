He got his first kill by himself, and then his jungler gave him his next 3 kills, his top lane was 1-0 before apdo even roamed top which he only did once and got a kill. Overall his teammates never had more than 2 deaths and they really just played passively. He didn&#039;t ward up their lane or ward deep in the enemy jungle. The enemy jungler never even ATTEMPTED to gank him so he could play agressive as he liked and roam wherever he wanted.\r\n\r\nThe key ingredient I want to know, is how I can help my teammates in such a way without being in their lane or anywhere near their lane, so that they rarely ever die.\r\n\r\nOne factor that might play a possible role is that he is on the korean/chinese server, and they play a more smarter and passive style of gameplay, but I would like to hope the same methods can be applied to the OCE server with the same result.\r\n\r\nHowever I really want to know exactly how the average deaths of his teammates are 3.5 over 45 games with a 100% winrate in low elo.\r\n\r\nIf anyone has any information regarding this specific aspect of Apdo&#039;s gameplay that can shed some light on his solo queue success that would be great.","replies":[{"poster":"Tele","date":"2017-02-07T07:23:40.651+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"You'll probably want to check out LS's stuff then if you haven't already. \n\nIn terms of high elo analysts he's one of the best.

But not luck dependant on whether you climb or not. Basically if you are better than the division you are currently in, you'll climb. It may be a long grind, but you'll climb.\n\nA performance based system would be nice, but it would be hard to implement because performance is subjective. \n\nI'd like to see tiers removed and just a simple unhidden MMR value attached to players but I guess they will not go back to this system for a few reasons. For one, a lot of players are more attracted to getting borders and rewards at the end of the season. It's psychologically rewarding to players when they climb divisions even if their mmr remains at the same level. And Riot's matchmaking would come under more scrutiny if they made that change.\n\nAlso I would like to see tougher qualifications before people go into ranked mode. Something like you need 200 wins in normals + mastery level 6 on champions. Just to raise the skill level in ranked. This probably will also not happen, because Riot wants as many noobies on the scene to buy skins and merchandise etc. The current system of getting to level 30 is way to easy, promotes botters and account selling.","replies":[{"poster":"Transcender","date":"2017-02-11T06:00:11.159+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Main Line,realm=OCE,application-id=FjGAIbRv,discussion-id=8eo1glxk,comment-id=000200000000,timestamp=2017-02-11T04:29:46.863+0000)\n>\n> I would say that in OCE, soloqueue games are luck dependant in the sense of who you get paired with yes.
