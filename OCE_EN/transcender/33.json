Riot can experiment and monitor its progression to determine however they think would be best to enhance and expand on its potential, and be the first company with a ranking system in a team game that doesn&#039;t make people want to bomb their headquarters.\n\nI would also highly recommend removing people&#039;s ability to dodge and force them into champion select and if they dont ban because they were afk, then they miss out on the ban and their pick becomes randomly chosen from a pool of the champs they have based on their role(just to keep things relatively fair). This would only be fair for the solo performance ranking system as those players who were afk wouldn&#039;t be able to affect others with sub optimal impact towards the outcome but still have the chance to perform well and you wouldn&#039;t have 20 minute queue times from people declining or dodging.\n\nIf they queue up for a game, they can cancel before they are put into champion select but they are committing to a full on game once they are in. This should also mean that surrender vote cannot be initiated before 30 minutes.\n\nIf people still think that having 80% of your team affect your rank is more accurate than you having almost full control over your own rank (80%-90%), then when they create a team they can use that rank as their indicator for recruiting.\n\nAt least it will give people a choice of measurement when recruiting rather than having to trial everyone and everyone being mentally affected by a rank they shouldn&#039;t be at.\n\nIf you think we should have the option to choose then +1 this post.","replies":[{"poster":"Dream of H0pe","date":"2018-11-15T12:46:20.719+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"I hate duo queue and i hope it gets removed. really unfair and annoying when two people on comms abuse their advantage, or you have two people on comms on your team griefing you by being in their own delusional world.\n\nadditionally, i think ranked gap for duoing, if it needs to be kept, needs to be a lot smaller. like 2 division gap, not an entire tier lol.

Every midlaner would have to get used to having no blue buffs (affects the junglers creep score and clear speed).  No tanks, a vast unwillingness to adc with no peel in sight.  'Supports' are taking every cs they can themselves, and flashing out when the adc is in danger (expect 'supports' like leblanc, Nidalee, etc to be common).  \n\nNo one wants to teamfight with no tanks, and key ults and summoners are routinely burned to take a kill from a teammate to pad your score.\n\nThe game usually ends to bad splitpushing, as no one wants to stop the fed top laner 1v1, and no one will go in first as they are likely to die and wreck their score, so the trynd/yorick/nasus/jax etc, will knock over the base while the jungler is trying to get a few more enemy camps, and your top and mid are pushing lanes to get a slightly better CS score before game over. So we all just let the enemy wreck our base unless stopping it can be done solo.","replies":[{"poster":"Transcender","date":"2018-11-16T07:42:46.152+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"You realise that you just perfectly described how my average ranked game is played out right?\n\nI can't actually tell if you are being sarcastic or not, partially because you didn't specify which queue you were talking about, so I have to assume you are referring to the one I recommended implementing (solo performance based rank).\n\nOn top of that, you are once again assuming that you know how the system will function.\n\nFirst of all, why in the actual fuck would the support roles performance be impacted AT ALL, by how much gold/cs/kills they got?\n\nSecond of all picking a champion that excels at being a tank would mean that your performance would be more based off how much utility and tanking you do (specifically in teamfights/skirmishes/1v1). So there would have to be a minimum range that teammates would have to be in relative to the number of enemies in a slightly larger range due to the normal positioning requirement of the frontline relative to the enemy and teammates. Deaths would also be a slight negative so people dont just run into teamfights and int. They will try to deal their cc, and tank for as long as they can before baiting the enemy who is trying to kill them passed their\n\nTeamfights don't need tanks and if neither team has tanks and your role is based off dealing damage you are going to want to be dealing damage to try to raise your score whilst avoiding deaths.\n\n\"key ults and summoners are routinely burned to take a kill from a teammate to pad your score\"\n\nHave you seen the support role lately?\n\nFlash+ignite+electrocute on a burst combo mage with 0 defensive abilities. Honestly I don't know why zed isn't being played support instead, he does the job they are trying to do but better.\n\nThere are various ways to easily implement role specific features that are already in the current games mechanics and would easily be within the scope of the games functionality to create an awesome ranked system that ENCOURAGES teamwork and teamplay in order to increase each others performance.\n\nNow can everyone stop being so quick to assume they think they know how this is going to play out?","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Transcender","date":"2018-11-19T09:14:57.725+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Cmon guys we need more votes for the opportunity to explore a new era in team based ranking systems.","replies":[]}]}
