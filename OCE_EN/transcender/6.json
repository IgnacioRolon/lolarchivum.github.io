It has holes that lead to false information clearly defined in the equation. You cannot rely on the information you can only hope that it is right. Teams try to get players of a particular minimum rank and refuse to trial anyone below that level because they think it is a waste of time, but they still trial players who potentially could not even be up to that level. This is where I have the problem. If you are going to trial anyone, then trial everyone because rank is too unreliable for a source of information.\n\n> You believe yourself to be on par with Challenger players, yet are in Silver yourself so why is that?

From coaching experience, some players are just not worth the effort to be coached, because they come in with all kinds of preconceived nonsense. No amount of coaching changes their mind. And essentially its not really coaching, just finding a sparring partner to prattle off some ideas.\nThat being said, if you pay someone the right amount of money for their time, they might spend some time with you!","replies":[{"poster":"Transcender","date":"2018-02-08T01:32:23.372+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"If I was rich enough to pay people money to attempt to teach them things, then I would have just bought a challenger account.","replies":[{"poster":"Joiksu","date":"2018-02-08T06:32:20.960+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Well I mean, people's time is valuable, you don't get coaching in other realms for free.

One cynical game won't teach you much at all. If you want to learn another perspective, you have to accept it as it is, and try it properly before saying you don't like it or it's wrong.","replies":[{"poster":"Transcender","date":"2018-02-07T14:58:14.787+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":6,"body":"Incorrect, according to everyone, I am missing something, not dismissing something.\n\n\"it is the mark of an educated mind to entertain an idea, without accepting it.\"\n\nFunny thing is that I am entertaining the idea of teammates not affecting your rank just by trying to solo carry which I have been attempting for many years using all different strategies, but people are not entertaining the idea that they do affect your rank.\n\nEveryone seems eager to make claims, without any real evidence to back it up. The worst part is they are not willing to prove it.\n\nAlso, you didn't actually answer my question, you just stated what you thought I conclude with. Which is funny because I never conclude anything. My mind has been changed many times by experience and research and I am not even considering the possibility that there is nothing more than what I have perceived. The very fact that I am human means I am prone to making a ton of mistakes. The biggest difference I see is that I am more openly willing to admit that I could be making mistakes. Which is also the reason I am so eager to be proven wrong, because I know that I am so open to being proven wrong and I am just begging to be shown what I am missing. I am told that 95% of my games are winnable and as that is a win rate that is alien to me, I would very much like to explore it, but no one is willing to show me and I can find no evidence anywhere to support anything close to it. So based on my experience dealing with humans, I can only thus far conclude that they are talking out of their ass.","replies":[{"poster":"JasonWazza","date":"2018-02-07T15:46:59.560+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"And that is exactly why no one want's to play with you.","replies":[{"poster":"00shots00","date":"2018-02-08T00:50:50.677+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"why? he had many points in there and you haven't said which one is the reason.","replies":[{"poster":"JasonWazza","date":"2018-02-08T03:17:26.125+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"***","replies":[{"poster":"Mozzie25","date":"2018-02-08T04:08:27.747+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Holy shit I’ve never seen that interview before.
