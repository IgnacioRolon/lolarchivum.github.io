The argument could be made though that it adds game depth in the sense of another thing that you have to keep track of in the game, \"separating good players from the great\". \n\nOne thing that a lot of pro players will talk about is DI or direct input and I think it could be applied here. DI is where you click as close to your champion as possible to gain as much influence as you can over how they move around the map. This can be used to move around minions making for less time/movement loss.\n\n---\n\nOn the other hand the alternative is that Riot could have it so that you moved through minions without colliding with them being able to move through them as freely as you want. This could lead to complaints from the community about the game engine \"not being realistic enough\" since it doesn't factor in minions with movement.\n\n---\n\nA possible option is to try learning to factor minion movement into your gameplay. [Riot did a dev blog on the specifics of minion movements and AI rules](http://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/developer-corner/qRHotV9k-minion-ai-rules-documentation), so if you want to learn more about this, I would highly suggest giving it a read. \n\n---\n\nWhat do you think of the thoughts that I have brought up? I am curious to see your input. If there is anything I can expand on or any other questions you have let me know, and good luck in your games.\n\n~Elam","replies":[{"poster":"Transcender","date":"2017-02-04T12:37:23.698+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"I think you have valid points IF minion AI was predictable, I consistently see unpredictable behaviour from minions. Everything from a minion running past another minion wave and even ignoring the turret, to things like minions bering randomly stuck on a tower. When I get attacked by a wave of minions, when I disengage, some will chase me right back to the tower while others instantly go back to attacking other minions without even letting off attacks on me/others. I have even seen a minion wave literally push my friend up against a wall and hold him there while the enemy freely killed him.\n\nIf they made minion AI consistent and predictable, THEN it would be a reliable variable to outplaying someone or being outplayed. Until that time, it should not be interfering in such ridiculous ways.","replies":[]}]}]}
