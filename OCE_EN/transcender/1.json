Yet I have won 59.1% of those games.\n\nCould someone please compare this to a diamond smurf cause apparently they get 65% win rate or higher, so I would just like to compare the scores of them to mine, from this we should be able to determine the comparison of teammates that they get, and those that i get.\n\nLast season I had a 60% win rate over 336 games as twitch.\n\nI have climbed out of bronze 3 times and now for the 4th time I have been put back into bronze 4 from the reset winning 5/10 of my games from silver 4.\n\nIf I were to have balanced teams, I should be winning over 80% of those games even with the occasional team being unable to find their keyboard during a teamfight, or the tanks sitting behind me as the entire enemy team engages, or my adc who thinks its their job to run through an enemy nasus jarvan and blitzcrank to try kill a malzahar. Maybe even with my support who thinks their role is to copy the adc, thereby taking farm and kills from me as thresh. Even when I am maxed build by 33 minutes and my teammates average score is 2-7 and think they should sit behind me when I am the adc. Even if my volibear did initiate a fight by throwing the fed pure armour/devourers udyr on top of me as I unstealth as twitch to teamfight.\n\nIf those things were to occasionally happen in my games, I would be diamond by now if the rest of my games were balanced and the teams were evenly skilled according to me right?\n\nSo apparently I keep getting told that it is up to me whether I get out of low elo or not, so according to absolutely everyone, I should be diamond+, and yet according to everyone I apparently need to get better, because going 22-12 as the ad carry and not having anyone peel for me is my fault and I should be able to stop that from happening because apparently this is not a team game and it is purely up to me whether or not my teammates can do their job in the situation that is given.\n\nPlaying over 3000 games and being able to do my job effectively in at least 90% of those games should effectively give me around a 70% win ratio with 20% of my games having teammates who are not able to do their role as effectively as the enemy team I should have won 2100 games, and lost 900.\n\nSo I should have 1200 wins over even win/loss ratio.\n\nSo lets say that I had no bonus mmr gain from winning streaks and no negative for losing streaks.\n\nIt takes 140 points approximately (5 wins and 2 promo wins(3 for league promos))\n\n1200 x 20 = 24000 points\n\nSo I should have 24000 points lets say from bronze 5 (I started at bronze 3).\n\nLet's say I had to win all 3 games in each promos so we get a stable even amount across all promotion requirements.\n\n24000 ÷ 160 = 150\n\nSo if I were to have 1 in 5 of my games as unwinnable due to teammates, I would have gone up 150 divisions from bronze 5.\n\nI would have gone from bronze 5 to diamond 5, 6 times.\n\nIf I were to have only played and done my role correctly only 80% of the time with only 1 in 5 teams being too hard to get a victory with.\n\nI would have only gone from bronze 5 to diamond 3 times.\n\nIf I were to have only done my role correctly 75% of the time, I should have gone from bronze 5 to diamond 1 time and another account to gold.\n\nWith twitch alone, this season I have lost 40% of my games with 100% of those games having a strong positive score and being able to do my job.\n\n40% of my games are unwinnable due to my team being unable to correctly play their roles to an equal standard to the enemy team.\n\nThis is an average of my season 5 solo queue experience.\n\nIt just so happens that with twitch last season of 336 games, I have a win rate of approximately 60%. Coincidentally that means 40% of my games I lost.\n\nGo ahead and keep telling me that I am the reason I cannot climb to diamond, because if i were you I would've done it 6 times by now and ill keep laughing about it.","replies":[{"poster":"Patyfatycake","date":"2015-02-01T17:21:56.052+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"Just reading this I can see you are overly arrogant in your own abilities.\n\n\"tanks sitting behind me as the entire enemy team engages\"/\"think they should sit behind me when I am the adc\" - Or you are just infront of them?

OF COURSE NOT.\n\"support who thinks their role is to copy the adc, thereby taking farm and kills from me\" - If you can't out last hit a support you have a problem at last hitting.\n\"Even if my volibear did initiate a fight by throwing the fed pure armour/devourers udyr on top of me\" - If you ultimate should have not enough range to attack you, also if you expected that it could happen why did you not position accordingly?\n\"Playing over 3000 games\" - Still happens? For sure its you not being good enough.\n\nBtw if you were me you would have reached platinum not diamond.
