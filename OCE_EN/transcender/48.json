That is an insane amount of people purposely trying to lose ranked games. Out of 3000 games at least 90% of those go through several surrender votes.\r\n\r\nI highly suggest to riot that either this becomes a unanimous vote in order to initiate the surrender or take out surrendering completely. If I had accepted every surrender vote I would have NEGATIVE mmr right now and that shouldn't be possible for someone attempting to play this game professionally.\r\n\r\nI have posted on a similar matter to this one regarding my solo queue matchmaking experience and I have got almost no assistance from riot previously except for one riot staff member (Riot Cochese) who was unable to help me due to being in a different area of expertise. I have also submitted a support ticket which gave me absolutely no help whatsoever.\r\n\r\nIf I do not receive personal help for this then at least look deeper into the surrender vote system.","replies":[{"poster":"HORSE OF FORCE","date":"2015-02-26T10:01:17.942+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"This seems more like a feature suggestion than a request for help. Personally, I think that the surrender system as it is now is flawed, and very much like the idea of a vote for a vote, as redundant as it seems.\n\nPerhaps head over to [Player Creations](http://boards.oce.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/player-creations)?","replies":[]}]}
