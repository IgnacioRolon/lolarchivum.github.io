I am 100 percent sure if we don't have luck then we can't climb lol.\n\nI was stuck in bronze 3 last season, after I get to bronze 1 every time I get the problem where 90 percent of my mates are outmatched and I drop to season 4.  Then I climbed again and this a repetive cycle as I always lost the promos.\n\nThis season though Lady Luck smiled on me, most of my team mates are last season Gold and I get carried every game hard this season and now Silver 5. But Since the firewall bug with the last patch I got frucked and someone kidnapped my Lady Luck, I think it must be Rito and their disgusting fiddly and restless hands that killed the servers.","replies":[{"poster":"HORSE OF FORCE","date":"2015-02-08T09:27:04.413+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":">I think it must be Rito and their disgusting fiddly and restless hands that killed the servers.\n\nThat's the most logical thing I've seen you write.","replies":[{"poster":"godsmustbecrazy3","date":"2015-02-08T23:02:26.669+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=HORSE OF FORCE,realm=OCE,application-id=ElA0rvVL,discussion-id=heojJEZU,comment-id=000000000000,timestamp=2015-02-08T09:27:04.413+0000)\n>\n> That's the most logical thing I've seen you write.\n\nYa I know, I was half brain dead when I made that reply because I never had enough sleep lol.
