I am not sure that is the reason everyone uses it for but that is ideal in my eyes for an all round good summoner for a carry.\r\n\r\nHeal on ADC I think is a waste of a summoner spell exclusively on ADC. Now I hear a lot of people state the reasoning behind Heal on ADC is that it not only heals you but you would normally also heal your support as well and therefore the total healing overall for both you and the support is more than barrier plus movement speed buff etc. If the support was the one taking heal on the other hand, this would make your heal almost half as effective (speed buff still at full strength). I also see people say that if the support has heal then if the ADC is alone, they wont have that heal available to them. Barrier however would block more damage if the ADC is alone. Ignite on ADC would also allow more kill pressure from the ADC, and would more often allow the kill to go to the ADC instead of the support. Barrier would be better defensively against assassins and nukers and ignite would be better offensively for securing kills and anti heal.\r\n\r\nFlash on support is more champion AND objective dependent than anything else. For example it might be better on an alistar who can flash knock up and then headbutt an enemy into his ADC/tower/team rather than an exhaust or a heal. However if you were focusing purely no your ADC and trying to keep them alive above all else, It might be better to take heal with exhaust just to make sure those nukers dont still have enough damage to kill your ADC through your exhaust.\r\n\r\nIgnite on support I understand is because people think that ADC should not be in range of people to ignite them, but according to league wiki, ignite has a 600 range which is more range than the AA range of most ADC, if you are never in range to auto attack your enemy you are either ezreal, or you are not a carry. Therefore I would say the support should never have ignite as it should not be their job to negate healing effects (certain carry items do that anyway). Leaving them the best option of usually going for heal + exhaust.\r\n\r\nKey information:\r\nPeople say that the support would get focused down hard because they dont have flash etc.\r\nIf the enemy if focusing your support with their core abilities, as the ADC you should be using your main abilities to trade damage with them and if they do not stop trying to kill your support, you should both be going all in on the priority target. Even if your support dies, this will guarantee a kill for your ADC 99% of the time. \r\n\r\nNow for some maths.\r\n\r\nAt level 1:\r\nIf the ADC takes heal, he can potentially have 90 extra health from heal plus movespeed.\r\nIf the support takes heal as well, they can potentially have 180 + 90 total health between the 2 of them (135 health for each). Unless they spread the heals out so the debuff doesnt take effect, in which case 180 + 180 health when not used in the same fight.\r\nIf the support takes heal and the ADC takes barrier they can have a total health pool increase of 180 + 110. (200 for the ADC and 90 for the support).\r\n\r\nAt the end of the day it is more about what your game plan is as opposed to a one fits all. Which means not only should no one be complaining about summoners, but they should be trying to play around their teams strategies as well.","replies":[{"poster":"Tsundere Support","date":"2018-10-10T11:17:15.184+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"As a start, as long as something like flash Q on {{champion:12}} (Q flash is actually better btw) is good, flash on any support is good because you can dodge it with flash as well. Reposition to hit/block key skills, to cancel animation, to survive longer for more rotations on skills.  Also ganks do exist, its not a 2v2 lane game... \nAny good jungler would camp bot if you don't take flash simply because you have less ability for escape.\n\nOn ignite for supports, it depends. If you don't have kill pressure in lane, exhaust is a lot better then ignite.  Exhaust does a better job late game. A well timed exhaust can shut down an entire assassin combo. This depends on the meta.\nIgnite's heal reduction is good early game because you do not have 800g to buy {{item:3123}}, getting an ADC buying {{item:2055}} is already hard enough....\nAn ignite before a heal cuts 40% off the heal effect to enable you have a better all in, as well as providing an extra source of burst, which is why you take it, not for securing the kill....\n\nAnd because exhaust does the job for barrier, why not take heal on ADC . Heal is a much better skill to kite bruiser then barrier.\nIgnite on ADC is bad in teamfights, a ignite thrown on a front line is much less effective then on a ADC\nA support also has a better chance then an ADC to utilise ignite. And that's what ADC will be hitting most of the time during a fight.\n\nIgnite-support barrier-ADC certainly is fine IMO.\n\nA side note:\nA support doesn't necessary need to babysit the ADC the whole game,  I'll normally ditch my ADC if he is bad and go roam, if my mid laner mage is fed and my ADC is not, I might protect and peel my mid rather then my ADC even my top laner or jungler. My goal is to win the game, not to make the ADC happy.","replies":[{"poster":"Transcender","date":"2018-10-12T04:53:13.419+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I understand ignite wouldn't be very effective on ADC in teamfights with the exception of an enemy mundo frontline.\n\nIn terms of utility, it would be more effective to rely on ghost or exhaust to kite instead of heal.\n\nLike I said, the supports summoners would be dependent on their game plan. Personally from my experience, supporting me correctly will result in a win 99% of the time depending on how much the randoms are intentionally feeding and trying to ruin my game.","replies":[]}]}]}
