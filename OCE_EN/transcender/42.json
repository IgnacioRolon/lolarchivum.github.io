Yet I have won 59.1% of those games.\n\nCould someone please compare this to a diamond smurf cause apparently they get 65% win rate or higher, so I would just like to compare the scores of them to mine, from this we should be able to determine the comparison of teammates that they get, and those that i get.\n\nLast season I had a 60% win rate over 336 games as twitch.\n\nI have climbed out of bronze 3 times and now for the 4th time I have been put back into bronze 4 from the reset winning 5/10 of my games from silver 4.\n\nIf I were to have balanced teams, I should be winning over 80% of those games even with the occasional team being unable to find their keyboard during a teamfight, or the tanks sitting behind me as the entire enemy team engages, or my adc who thinks its their job to run through an enemy nasus jarvan and blitzcrank to try kill a malzahar. Maybe even with my support who thinks their role is to copy the adc, thereby taking farm and kills from me as thresh. Even when I am maxed build by 33 minutes and my teammates average score is 2-7 and think they should sit behind me when I am the adc. Even if my volibear did initiate a fight by throwing the fed pure armour/devourers udyr on top of me as I unstealth as twitch to teamfight.\n\nIf those things were to occasionally happen in my games, I would be diamond by now if the rest of my games were balanced and the teams were evenly skilled according to me right?\n\nSo apparently I keep getting told that it is up to me whether I get out of low elo or not, so according to absolutely everyone, I should be diamond+, and yet according to everyone I apparently need to get better, because going 22-12 as the ad carry and not having anyone peel for me is my fault and I should be able to stop that from happening because apparently this is not a team game and it is purely up to me whether or not my teammates can do their job in the situation that is given.\n\nPlaying over 3000 games and being able to do my job effectively in at least 90% of those games should effectively give me around a 70% win ratio with 20% of my games having teammates who are not able to do their role as effectively as the enemy team I should have won 2100 games, and lost 900.\n\nSo I should have 1200 wins over even win/loss ratio.\n\nSo lets say that I had no bonus mmr gain from winning streaks and no negative for losing streaks.\n\nIt takes 140 points approximately (5 wins and 2 promo wins(3 for league promos))\n\n1200 x 20 = 24000 points\n\nSo I should have 24000 points lets say from bronze 5 (I started at bronze 3).\n\nLet's say I had to win all 3 games in each promos so we get a stable even amount across all promotion requirements.\n\n24000 รท 160 = 150\n\nSo if I were to have 1 in 5 of my games as unwinnable due to teammates, I would have gone up 150 divisions from bronze 5.\n\nI would have gone from bronze 5 to diamond 5, 6 times.\n\nIf I were to have only played and done my role correctly only 80% of the time with only 1 in 5 teams being too hard to get a victory with.\n\nI would have only gone from bronze 5 to diamond 3 times.\n\nIf I were to have only done my role correctly 75% of the time, I should have gone from bronze 5 to diamond 1 time and another account to gold.\n\nWith twitch alone, this season I have lost 40% of my games with 100% of those games having a strong positive score and being able to do my job.\n\n40% of my games are unwinnable due to my team being unable to correctly play their roles to an equal standard to the enemy team.\n\nThis is an average of my season 5 solo queue experience.\n\nIt just so happens that with twitch last season of 336 games, I have a win rate of approximately 60%. Coincidentally that means 40% of my games I lost.\n\nGo ahead and keep telling me that I am the reason I cannot climb to diamond, because if i were you I would've done it 6 times by now and ill keep laughing about it.","replies":[{"poster":"HORSE OF FORCE","date":"2015-02-02T07:55:15.915+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Win-rates and score isn't really reliable things to gauge your skill or prowess, due to the sheer amount of other contributing factors that apply to winning a game. It's so complicated that I doubt there'll ever be an electronic tool that can be used to accurately gauge a person's skill at the game.\n\nBut anyway I'll indulge you.\n\n>I have gone very positive in 95%+ of those games (one game I had a negative score). Yet I have won 59.1% of those games.\n\nThere are five members on your team. You having a good score doesn't do much, as you're only one fifth of your entire team. It's what you do with that small advantage that decides the game.\n\n>Could someone please compare this to a diamond smurf cause apparently they get 65% win rate or higher\n\nThe key word here is \"apparently\". And of course they'd be getting higher win-rates, because they're versing people who just aren't their calibre.\n\n>I have climbed out of bronze 3 times\n\nSo you're proven to be inconsistent?\n\n>If I were to have balanced teams, I should be winning over 80% of those games even with the occasional team being unable to find their keyboard during a teamfight, or the tanks sitting behind me as the entire enemy team engages, or my adc who thinks its their job to run through an enemy nasus jarvan and blitzcrank to try kill a malzahar.

Even if my volibear did initiate a fight by throwing the fed pure armour/devourers udyr on top of me as I unstealth as twitch to teamfight.  \n\n>**the meta**\n\nCome on, that's the meta, it doesn't *need* to be stringently followed to win games. What you need is some more communication. Make clear your intentions and what you'd like your team-mates to do, politely of course.\n\n>If those things were to occasionally happen in my games, I would be diamond by now if the rest of my games were balanced and the teams were evenly skilled according to me right?\n\nYou've only had twenty games. That's not a lot. You can't go from bronze to diamond in twenty games. And hell, you've never been above silver, what are you even talking about here?\n\n>So apparently I keep getting told that it is up to me whether I get out of low elo or not\n\nThat's not true. There is always an element of surprise and unexpected circumstances, be it your opponents or your team-mates, due to how the game is designed. And the way it's designed is to be fair to everyone, so these imbalances will both be in your favour and against it. Of course, you still have a huge influence over the outcome, so don't despair.\n\n>because going 22-12\n\nIf you die you give the enemy gold, and the more gold you have yourself (cumulatively), the more gold you reward. A score of 4/0 is *way* better than a score of 22/12.\n\n>it is purely up to me whether or not my teammates can do their job in the situation that is given.\n\nTeam-mates are not forced to do particular jobs for you. If the game was like that, it wouldn't be very enjoyable. Communication is vital.\n\n>So lets say that I had no bonus mmr gain from winning streaks and no negative for losing streaks.\n\n>It takes 140 points approximately (5 wins and 2 promo wins(3 for league promos))\n\n>1200 x 20 = 24000 points\n\n>So I should have 24000 points lets say from bronze 5 (I started at bronze 3).\n\nFirstly this isn't how it works. Secondly no one knows how it works *for sure*. The rough concensus is that it's based off of your situation, and whether you were expected to win or not (most websites claiming to \"calculate\" your elo just give you the average of the opponents you've versed based on their division's average MMR).\n\n>So if I were to have 1 in 5 of my games as unwinnable due to teammates, I would have gone up 150 divisions from bronze 5.\n\nYou can't be saying that you'll play perfectly every game and not make mistakes.\n\n>Go ahead and keep telling me that I am the reason I cannot climb to diamond, because if i were you I would've done it 6 times by now and ill keep laughing about it.\n\nThat's not a very concise conclusion, but I'll guess you're meaning that there's a force which is hell-bent on making sure your team-mates are preventing you from winning games.\n\nThe way match-making is configured, you'll get some games where this is true and some where it's not. It's completely random, and because of that, it's fair. If you were truly a diamond player stuck in a bronze player's account, then you would be winning more games than you're losing due to your higher knowledge of the game. That would eventually get you to your diamond, surely.\n\nIt's a very negative way of looking at it. I just play and play to the best of my ability. I know there will be games I lose and games I'll win, but it's the influence I have over them that I focus on. Making sure that I'm controlling objectives which benefit your entire team, like Dragon, I find is more effective in guaranteeing a win than anything else.\n\nHope this helps.","replies":[]}]}
