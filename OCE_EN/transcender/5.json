I notice Apdo playing tf helps his team by being a deterrent for the enemy team when it is a bad situation, he would go through his cards in front of them to threaten a gold card stun if they engaged on his teammate. The difference is, his teammates are smart enough not to see it as thinking they should go in cause he has their back.
