If my teams were even I would not mind, but I dont understand why it is already almost impossible for me to climb and then after we won 5 out of 10 games in provisionals I get demoted by an entire league.\n\nI am making every attempt to play professionally and I just can't get past my own teammates let alone the 4 fed enemies I have to outplay after that. Why am I being put down an entire league?\n\nI have done quite well to not shroud this entire post in inappropriate language.","replies":[{"poster":"HORSE OF FORCE","date":"2015-01-23T10:27:00.509+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":">I have been in bronze 3 times and I have got myself back up to silver 3 times,\n\nDoesn't this just prove that your skill is inconsistent?\n\n>I get demoted by an entire league.\n\nYou weren't demoted. The season reset and that's where you were placed.\n\nThank you for refraining from the abusive language, I appreciate it.\n\nThis game is a team game, where ranked is a place you can go to have a fair game with other people. If you're getting team mates that supposedly \"can't do their job\" or \"steal the kills\", then you can be assured that there are also players like that on the enemy team.\n\nIt's all about perspective, you know?","replies":[{"poster":"Transcender","date":"2015-01-23T18:00:12.523+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I play starcraft, used to be masters, I am now diamond close to being masters again.\n\nMy skill would be relevant only if I was the only player on the team, but even if I screwed up my team should be able to pick up the pieces half the time right?\n\nIf I am doing my job effectively in every situation then I should be racking up the wins right because my team should be evenly skilled with the enemy team more often than not right?\n\nI just do not think it is fair that while I am trying to get to challenger, I am repeatedly having to strain myself trying to get out of a league for an entire season only to be placed back in there when I have been winning more games than I have been losing.\n\nI know all about perspective and I know when the enemy team is detrimenting their own team.\n\nShouldn't my placement be determined on last season and by a small amount during preseason, not just massively dropped on the start of a new season?","replies":[{"poster":"HORSE OF FORCE","date":"2015-01-24T09:36:00.262+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"And that's how it is.\n\nI'm sorry about, your placement is determined by the opponents you verse.

That is just in my lane, the rest of the team is losing the living crap out of their lane so I am unable to carry them when they cant do their job, this makes it literally impossible to do anything from that point because there is no outplaying the enemy at that point.","replies":[]},{"poster":"sewb","date":"2015-01-22T15:38:31.953+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I completely agree with you man, but if you have the skills you'll get there.
