I can play every role but every role is designed to do different things in the game. Why force me to play something I wasn&#039;t planning on playing? My whole team ends up tilted because I got autofilled into a role I don&#039;t main.\n\nwhy make us pick roles if we are not guaranteed to get them, that just throws out the entire balance of ranked. It is like every 5 games you play in sc2, 1 of them you have to play another race other than your main. Your mmr would be fucked and that is in a 1v1 game.","replies":[{"poster":"LetsTwitch","date":"2018-01-15T10:35:05.058+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I can play every role but am extremely single-minded. If I set out to play Top/Mid and get support, which is probably my best role, I will 99% of the time lose all interest in playing the match","replies":[]},{"poster":"Fitzky","date":"2018-01-13T02:38:37.537+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"It sucks for low elo players who need to focus on getting good at 2 roles to climb but Riot doesn't care, fast queues times are all that matters apparently. Even though waiting an extra 5 mins to get ur role is better than playing out a 30 minute game of fucking support and losing. Another shit decision to add to the list.","replies":[{"poster":"Transcender","date":"2018-01-13T03:01:47.375+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"Yeah it isn't just bad for low elo players though, if you have to wait 30 mins for a game in challenger and end up getting autofilled into a role you don't main, then you are not exactly able to perform at your best and therefore are not given the same chance as everyone else in the game.","replies":[]}]}]}
