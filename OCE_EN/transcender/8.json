Looks about 20% more on that web graph but It is in fact over 90% more damage share. That stat is literally off the chart relative to the &quot;best twitch player oce&quot;.\n\nTry give me someone to compare my stats to who surpasses mine.","replies":[{"poster":"BarryButcher","date":"2018-08-15T07:05:10.130+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"But you're playing against Silver/Gold opponents who don't stop to think \"i shouldn't over extend because twitch will stealth on me\".

In saying that, you're implying that players at your rank are going to act more or less the same as players at the other players rank, which just doesn't happen when you're several tiers apart. The average bronze player will act differently to the average silver player, who will act differently to the average gold player and so on.\n\nThere's a very good reason why players at higher ranks tend to have what some may consider \"relatively low stats\", and it's because of the very nature of high rank. Players at those ranks have *vastly* superior skill, knowledge and mechanical ability. They don't make many of the mistakes that are common in low elo, they know what they are doing and how to do it at *least* most of the time, which subsequently results in those kinds of stats. Comparing low elo to high elo is kind of like comparing under-12s footy to the AFL, it just doesn't work.","replies":[{"poster":"Transcender","date":"2018-08-15T14:00:06.145+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=HeartVine,realm=OCE,application-id=Ntey9fRZ,discussion-id=AXEBqL7x,comment-id=000000000000,timestamp=2018-08-15T12:07:49.672+0000)\n>\n> Except that&#x27;s kind of the issue with this comparison.

That is why I am not comparing a silver player playing in diamond to a diamond player playing in diamond, or a diamond player playing in silver to a diamond player playing in diamond.\n\nI am comparing a silver player playing against silvers, to a diamond player playing against diamonds.\n\nWhich is why my stats should be closer to the average of my rank, rather than the web graph displaying my stats incorrectly because it is off the scales.\n\n\n\n> There&#x27;s a very good reason why players at higher ranks tend to have what some may consider &quot;relatively low stats&quot;, and it&#x27;s because of the very nature of high rank.

It is the same game but at different levels. Your analogy is referencing 2 different games, like comparing league of legends silver to high mmr dota.\n\nThe identical same rules apply from my previous comment you replied to which answers your question.\n\nRelativity is still being left out of your equation.\n\na silver player doing something getting killed and the enemy doing something and getting themselves killed to that same player, is the same as the high elo not doing something stupid and not getting killed and his enemy doing the same thing. It is an equally balanced outcome from both sides. Which means, that if I get kills, I should also be equally getting killed by those players who are at my rank, it cancels itself out.\n\nYour point is just not valid.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}
