Accounting for travel time and assuming you eat 2 minute noodles for every meal, and are really quick with your bodily functions, that gives you around 4 hours to work a job to earn enough money to stay alive. And no job that will let you work 4 hours a day, is going to provide you with enough money anyway.\n\nClearly, education takes up more than 4 hours a day, so if you are still in the education system, you won't have enough time to practice your way into the pro leagues.\n\nNot to mention that a pro-gamer's career doesn't last long, and they come out the other end with virtually no real life skills at all, and still have 60 or years left of life to get through. _(remember that League's life as a game is also limited, so its not like you can coach your way through the rest of life either)_.\n\nBut something tells me that this is all irrelevant anyway, seeming you were threatening to switch games to startcraft just because you were autofilled a couple of times.

A constant reminder that the word 'planet' is a man made concept we use to try and label the universe, because its man made, there is no 'all-correct' distinction, we can choose to make it mean whatever we want, which is why it changes often.\n\nAs we find other 'planets' out there in the universe that take on forms we haven't considered yet, the definition will quite probably change again.  Pluto may well become a planet again, who knows.\nIf we find a planet out there that is exactly like earth with water and life and orbits a sun etc. Except that this planet is distinctly oval or elliptical shaped instead of spherical through some unique gravitational effect (something similar to Io maybe). Would that be considered a planet? According to the current definition, no.\nIt'd be safe to bet the definition would change again should a discovery like that be made.\n\nTo simply believe wholeheartedly in something purely because 'thats what it says' \nis hilariously simple minded.","replies":[{"poster":"Transcender","date":"2018-11-29T02:38:43.408+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"I wasn't referring to the idea of whether or not Pluto is a planet.\n\nApparently we have 32 servers according to your statistics.\n\nhttp://leagueoflegends.wikia.com/wiki/Servers\n\n\n\"Do you have loving parents?\"\n\nCan you please elaborate on what this is meant to refer to?

Thats why pro gamers train as a 'team' and don't just play solo queue all day.\nThose players who do well in solo queue are those player that understand this, and rather than trying to carry their team every game, they play to the teams strengths and help everyone succeed as a cohesive group.","replies":[{"poster":"Lord Sesshomaru","date":"2018-11-30T09:15:42.895+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> Money isn't a service though, it is a resource used to exchange for a service.\n\n1. I never said it was a service.\n2. You expect to get this money how exactly? (Without participating in society.)\n\nNo. Money has no value at all _(short of whatever the value of used paper is)_\n\nReal world objects have innate value, but money doesn't. Money is something we all 'pretend' has value, so that we don't have to pay for the groceries with our kitchen table, or so surgeons don't have to perform an operation on the cashier every time they want a chocolate bar.\n\nAs population grows, and various goods/services go in and out of demand (i.e you won't pay as much for a home phone now as you would have 30 years ago.) hence how much we 'pretend' the paper is worth, changes with all these different factors.\nDo I really need to give you a 3rd grade economics lesson?\n\n> Can you elaborate more on how this is possible\n\nThe whole is greater than the sum of its parts.\nI explained it already I won't repeat myself.\nI'm not your economics teacher or your english teacher.\n\nWhat is your obsession with servers?\nAccording to riot, there are about 32,500,000 registered accounts, which means you have to be better than almost 32,500,000 recorded players to be in the top spot. And virtually no one other than the top spot earns _millions of dollars_. It literally couldn't be any more simple.\n\nYou are 1 person. There is 1 top spot. There are 32,500,000 'players'.\n\nWhy you keep wanting me to say 'there are 32 servers' is beyond me.\n\nNot all the servers are equal, being challenger in OCE doesn't make you challenger in Korea, and if you're after 'millions of dollars' its not the OCE ladder you should be concerned with, its the global ladder _(ie. you gotta be better than everyone in all servers)_\n\nI really don't care what you call the bare minimum of playing. \nYou talk a hell of a lot about being good, and having these basically unbeatable strats, and from what I see, you have nothing to show for it except a plat account and a gold account. Neither of which are anywhere close to earning 'millions of dollars'.\n\nIt's like saying _\"Im really really good at speaking french. I just haven't learnt it yet, or spoken to any french people.\"_ Cool bro, tell me when you are fluent, not before.\n\nWhen you're earning millions of dollars, make another post and tell me I'm wrong all you want. Until that day however, any claim you can possibly make is hollow.\n\nAnd with that, i'm ending this farce.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"DarkShade918","date":"2018-11-28T09:05:03.422+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Lord Sesshomaru,realm=OCE,application-id=mR0UmRrp,discussion-id=EENpgAtE,comment-id=000200000000,timestamp=2018-11-28T08:45:41.135+0000)\n\n> Clearly you&#x27;ve never played with good Thresh/Taric/Raka/Leona/Blitz etc mains.
