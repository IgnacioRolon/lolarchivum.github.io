As long as you can actually coach the team, there will be no issues. We are currently Silver 2 on average across all members. We are looking at really smashing out the end of season 7 and finish it on a high, and then looking to pre-season to try new things and start off season 8 really well. We are holding a boot camp in Adelaide during the first week of January 2018, so if you could make that it would be great.\r\n\r\nPlease leave comments here or add me in game to further discuss it.","replies":[]}
