Did not play any more ranked after that. At least it was better than my Silver 3 in Season 4 (also only 10 games).\nI haven't touched ranked this preseason. Originally it was just because I didn't want to get caught in the rush, but then these \"miss-matching\" issues occurred and I just figured it was best to avoid it all together for a while.\nI deeply prefer ADC, even though I could seriously work on my last hitting. Preferred champs for ADC are Quinn, Kalista and Sivir, in that order.\nI'm also partial to Top. Preferred champs for Top are Quinn, Maokai and Teemo, in that order.\nShould be fairly obvious by this point, but Quinn is a bit of a favourite of mine. So consider that a deal-maker/breaker.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Deep Sanity","date":"2016-11-19T08:26:53.494+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Summoner Name: Deep Sanity\nSeason 6 rank: Silver 4\nCurrent flex rank: Bronze 3\nBest Champions for Role: Vayne, Lucian, Twitch / Hecarim, xin Zhao, Reksai\nRole: Adc/Jg","replies":[]},{"poster":"Krauser San","date":"2016-11-19T04:41:20.991+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"What rank are you guys?
