Also, will need to be competent with doing solid draft phases.\r\n\r\nIf interested, just chuck me a DM detailing your coaching experience, and what you believe you can bring to the organisation!","replies":[{"poster":"TheDemonEmperor","date":"2018-07-12T05:40:43.480+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You are not paying for the position.

Truth isn't in the OCS or OPL, and we just compete in amateur tournaments. There is no money involved for players or staff, and there isn't a reason for there to be considering it's purely amateur competition at the current point in time. \n\nCurrently, the team acts as a space for us to learn about teamplay, improve on macro and micro strategy, and for fun. I don't speak for everyone, but I'm pretty sure a few of us would like to play in the OCS at some point. Amateur tournaments and teams act as a sort of \"scouting grounds\" outside of SoloQ for that.\n\nIn terms of \"experience\", he's just asking people to detail what past coaching experience they have. They don't necessarily need to have any, it's just to gauge whether both parties would be able to work together well or not. You wouldn't submit a resume without listing where you've worked in the past, right? Same concept, minus the job and getting paid part. Coaches aren't expected to be Challenger, commit 40 hours a week + overtime, and drop everything for the team. We just want someone that knows what they're talking about to give us a hand with drafting better and maybe working on some mistakes for an hour or two after a week of scrims. \n\nIf someone wants to be paid for the position, then we'd just look for a paid coach. This is a position for someone that wants to have some fun and work on their coaching skills, learning some stuff on the way. No harm done if no one wants to, no harm done if someone does. It is what it is.","replies":[{"poster":"TheDemonEmperor","date":"2018-07-13T14:41:36.761+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"What you've said about the **extent **of a coach's responsibilty and abilities; It's missing from the context of the thread. \n\nFrom an outsider point of view, it seem you guys are asking for a qualify \"Proven working background\" person to take the postion.

The coach would have to forgo many leisures to ensures things are going well. Aswell as having a high degree of ability to assimilate rapport\". The way this thread was context, it is in no way an intern friendly position. \n\nThe poster should've put what is required from the applicants. ASWELL as introduce the organisation and explain reasons why working for the org would benefit the person. Perhave give a little insight on how things are now, and a realistic \"direction\" they would like to move toward.
