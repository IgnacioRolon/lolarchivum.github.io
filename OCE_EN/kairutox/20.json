We need AT LEAST 12 teams to make this happen, with a maximum of 24 for the three divisions.\r\n\r\nDivisions will be 6-8 teams in each. This league will be a 12 week event, continuing into a gauntlet style finals series, very much like the OPL.\r\n\r\nWith this being an amateur league, there will be opportunity to be promoted/relegated in order to freshen up the different teams in each division. These games will be played at the end of each league.\r\n\r\nDivision 1, which will be the highest division, will be played on Friday nights, with Division 2 being Wednesday nights, and if we get enough teams for 3 divisions (which I really hope we do), Division 3 will be played Monday nights.\r\n\r\nThere will be 3-4 games each night, with each team only playing once a week. We do plan on streaming all these games over two streams.\r\nIn order to keep this as an amateur league, we will not accept full challenger teams.\r\n\r\nWe are currently opening up applications for the Tesla Placement Tournament.\r\n\r\nSpread the word, get your friends and their teams involved!\r\n\r\nOnce joining on Battlefy, please join the Truth Gaming discord, and talk to a Leader in order to get your teams role made, and get given your role.\r\n\r\nThe discord link is https://discord.gg/4XPAhNt.\r\n\r\nThe Tesla Placement Tournament will be played on Friday the 25th May with a start time of 5:00pm ACST.\r\n\r\nEnter here! https://battlefy.com/truth-gaming/tesla-placement-tournament/5ae828161fa8b303830d89ac/info\r\n\r\nThe placement tournament will have no prize, as the Tesla League will hopefully be receiving Riot prizes.","replies":[]}
