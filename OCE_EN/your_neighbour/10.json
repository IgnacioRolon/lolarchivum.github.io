Its the same as going supp yasuo getting 0/0/0 23 still get S, because its better than other supp yasuos. Same jungle yasuo, thats really easy to get S on, because every1 is bad at jg yasuo","replies":[{"poster":"Your Neighbour","date":"2016-11-06T07:12:35.089+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Ahh I see I will test this out a bit more. Come to think of it in both cases they have been feeding = a lot of damage taken, and also using class not common for top.\n\n","replies":[]}]}]}
