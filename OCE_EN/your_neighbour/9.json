But back when I still actively played, the ones I saw typing entirely in Chinese is either mostly talking about the game and the teammates' performances like any other player would, or that when they have premades they just ramble about whatever trivial things they've encountered irl and having a laugh at each other. I mean, they are all in the end of the day, just players like everybody else, some are cool people while others wouldn't be so much, a language difference is not going to change the fundamentals much if at all. \n\nIf they do type insults that are legitimately just vile and bad, and that if you do understand the severity as well as the meaning of the said insult, feel free to report. But making the generalisation that they \"more often then not they are spouting insults at you\" is un-cool, even as a generalisation.","replies":[{"poster":"Talon12","date":"2016-12-19T01:49:39.408+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"They do, as you said they talk about your gameplay, and the chinese judge that very hard and usually negative about your gameplay.

But your intent for requesting that seems to be a bit screwed. You're requesting for an in-game feature not to provide or improve general service and/or experience, but to forward an assumption or otherwise an agenda on your part, that's not how things are done here.","replies":[{"poster":"Talon12","date":"2016-12-19T05:50:35.264+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'm not saying it's only chinese people who do it, what I'm saying is people can get away with insults, even death threats scott free by using another language because the game doesn't pick up on it","replies":[{"poster":"SEKAI","date":"2016-12-19T06:14:37.736+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Talon12,realm=OCE,application-id=FjGAIbRv,discussion-id=N6gP6EhN,comment-id=0002000000000000000000000000,timestamp=2016-12-19T05:50:35.264+0000)\n>\n> I&#x27;m not saying it&#x27;s only chinese people who do it, what I&#x27;m saying is people can get away with insults, even death threats scott free by using another language because the game doesn&#x27;t pick up on it\n\nIn that respect, as I've said, I agree that having a foreign profanity filter is okay, and that severe abuses should be reported. \n\nBut do note, we don't have filters for more elaborate kinds of insults such as death threats for English as well, since they come in various forms and sizes making it not possible to do without being too restrictive. However blocking out the usual and common profanity is easy to do and should be done anyway.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Łæoña","date":"2016-12-19T04:16:09.680+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I haven't seen any chinese profanity myself, even tho I am also asian which I've not thrown any insults whatsoever, unless it was constructive criticism. \n\nIf anyone is reading this then I would recommend to just pretend you cannot understand like anyone would do and just play.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"SEKAI","date":"2016-12-18T11:08:32.999+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":1,"body":"LOL you have to post 2 threads in a row for this shit?\n\nWhy aren't you complaining about toxic players on forum 24/7 then?

There was no hacking, there was no breach of rules, there was no griefing or whatever, it was just a bunch of Chinese players rushing into that game like everybody else and having fun in the game as intended, but they're guilty because?\n\nI mean, the \"outrage\" was so massive and so undeserving it literally got articles criticising the players' reaction.
