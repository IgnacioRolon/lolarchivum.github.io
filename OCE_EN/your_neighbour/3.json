(with the exception of Nasus who realy needs his stacks limited in some way ffs) \nIts Mages and ADCs are so fragile.","replies":[{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2016-12-29T15:30:23.047+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Well some tanks are rather disproportionate, but the way I see it is their survivability:damage ratios are way better than mages/marksman. In the time it takes an average tank to lose half their health to a squishy carry they can kill an average squishy carry (0.5:1), whereas mages/ADCs can kill a squishy carry just as quickly as they can be killed by one (1:1). The difference which I find is the key thing to balance around is the time it takes. Sure 1:1 looks worse than 0.5:1, but when one happens in 1-3 seconds and the other takes 10~ it makes a big difference.\n\nObviously some tanks can get pretty ridiculous if they get ahead (Nasus, Xin, Lee) and be impossible to kill with ridiculous amounts of damage, but if it's a mid laner getting ahead most reasonable people won't start calling \"OP\" just because they got blown up faster than usual.\n\nDo I think some tanks and \"tanks\" need tweaking? Absolutely. (Especially you Xin you unkillable way too much lifesteal for one LS item frustrating ass champion). Do I think some tanks snowball too hard in the damage direction? Yep. Do I think that immediately means all tanks are bullshit? Hardly. \n\nI have to agree with you on this one. There's much more to it than just \"tanks are OP\".\n\nIn fact if you asked me for the one key thing we could tweak to balance all the problematic tanks without destroying them I'd say it was CDs. Up the CD on things like Lee SIn's R, Nasus' Q (then half it if he uses it on a minion which I think might already be a thing but I'm not sure), Xin's 'reduce's all his other cds' bs one and so on and so forth. I'm fine with tanks dealing damage, but they shouldn't be able to do so with such consistency if they can also soak a butt ton of damage.","replies":[{"poster":"Valor Carrys","date":"2016-12-29T16:50:43.586+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":">most reasonable people won't start calling \"OP\" just because they got blown up faster than usual.\n\nSomeone doesn't remember Assassin's, and all the complaints we get when they are OP and are like this.\n\nAlso Squishy's shouldn't really complain about this since most of the time when they are taking too long to kill a tank it's because they have forgotten to buy the Last whisper set of items (either that or it's too early in the game.), which basically makes tank stats worthless.","replies":[{"poster":"Nightjar","date":"2016-12-29T17:35:32.535+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"you know or you could buy some lifesteal or even though I don't play adc much, sometimes when the enemy has a 3 tank bruiser type champions like having a darius, zac and leona, I feel that bork might be a good pickup even though you're an adc. Personally I feel bork and lastwhisper is a good combo when the enemy has alot of tanks and maybe a mercurial if they have alot of cc, and items like maw, edge of night and blackcleaver","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Valor Carrys","date":"2016-12-29T06:33:22.638+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"First, this is from early this year when Spirit Visage+Iceborn+Sunfire basically meant a free win for a tank (as you can tell from the date of the video.)\n\nSecond, he is being a smartass because he built those items on draven, who it doesn't work on.\n\nThird, because he is a draven main, this screws him over more then most ADC's as he has no mobility and struggles against these types of tanks, he was one of the worst champs in the meta, and he kept playing Draven.","replies":[{"poster":"BarryButcher","date":"2016-12-29T07:37:41.424+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"which is why Iceborn got nerfed and almost no one builds that combo anymore except maybe Poppy and Trundle.","replies":[{"poster":"Valor Carrys","date":"2016-12-29T07:41:43.472+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I mean there are still champions that synergize well with that combo, they just tend to want a botrk/Tri force and then into those items.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"SEKAI","date":"2016-12-29T06:51:42.720+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":2,"body":"\"Riot likes to make fking tanks, deal more fking damage, than AD carries\" - Tyler1.\n\nBecause clearly we never had the time when there were broken item balancing that benefited 1 specific type of play way more than others, making them OP.\n\nBut it's only a subject of complaint when the benefited are tanks.\n\nDidn't he remember the fking Black Cleaver nightmare a while back?
