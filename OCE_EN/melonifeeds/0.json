You have to afk/dc from quite a few games to even see a 5 minute LPQ.\n\nShit happens, everyone knows that, which is why the occasional leave won't be punished. At a point though, you (and Riot) have to consider the impact on other players. Every game you leave, intentionally or otherwise, negatively influences the experience of 9 other players. Riot can only give you so many free passes.\n\nIf you're having consistent connection troubles, it might be worth switching to ethernet/reducing interference/talking to your ISP. \n\nScoring 90% on the connection rating isn't the be all and end all. Maybe your connection is unstable at certain times of day, or under certain loads, or with certain brick walls between you and your router.","replies":[]}]}
