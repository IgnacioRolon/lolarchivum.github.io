Keep in mind that your chances of getting this request is higher if you can submit some of your own player-created content like a poem, song, picture, etc. This request can only be granted once per account per lifetime, so make it count! :)\n\nGood luck!","replies":[{"poster":"Sona Support","date":"2015-12-29T07:03:13.867+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"thanks mate ill do that now","replies":[]}]}]}
