Want to take it seriously again in the Support role. Looking for a decent ADC, or Jungle so that we can carry games and level up.\r\n\r\nI play Thresh/Bard mainly and this is why I&#039;m interested in Jungle players too, as I often make lantern and magical journey gank plays, which Silver players don&#039;t expect or know how to react to.\r\n\r\nAdd me in game if you wanna play some games.
