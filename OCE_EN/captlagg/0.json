His win rate is currently trending just below 60%.\r\n\r\nRiot: You advise the community that you want to increase counterplay, then how about you take a look at Warwick.\r\nReason: Once he hits level 6, Warwick has alot of the tools to initiate a gank, secure/pickup the kill, lifesteal through the whole afair and then go and take an objective. In this current meta he has very little counterplay against him other than run away. His ult's rnage is greater than flash, greater also than alot of champions displacement ability.\r\nI think it would be helpful if you **removed the on-hit interaction with his ult** and just had it deliver base+ AD scaling damage.\r\nOr\r\nDisable him from champ select until such time that you have a viable direction for his rework.","replies":[{"poster":"ArcticHorizon","date":"2014-12-04T05:48:06.046+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It's not Warwick, it's how his kit compliments the new jungle item. All that is required are a few tweaks, not an entire rework. Next patch (coming very soon) has nerfs to both WW and the feral-flare-style jungle item to balance things out. His win rate will level out after that. It's not worth disabling him now since the patch is imminent.\n\nsurrenderat20.net/p/current-pbe-balance-changes.html#balance for more details.","replies":[{"poster":"KingDinger","date":"2014-12-04T06:07:53.760+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"it is WW. anyone can get the item and stack it as fast if not faster than him. its the interaction between the 2. FF wasnt quite as bad for some unknown reason....might be the fact he starts with 40 base damage x 5 at lvl 6 ult without much interaction with anything till lvl 6 and that gold amount required for the item.\nWW was always a pain, its just other junglers could impact the early game effectively enough that his lvl 6 cancer ult power spike wasnt quite as foreboding. and WW has always been a big threat late game, and with the changes to MR itemization that has slightly helped WW further.\n\nan option would be to change the on hit to physical damage, same with WWs ult. that would help with both early and late game damage reduction counterplay by forcing WW into an almost pure physical damage dealer.\nthe slight nerfs to his early game ult damage wont change much apart from requiring an extra hit or 2 for kills. lategame the change seems so minor its almost non existant and he may still be able to 100-0 anyone who doesnt correctly itemize against him. (GD chat still has people asking if AR is good vs WW ult. streamers regularly incorrectly explain WW ult and why it works so well with the new jungle and items)\neither way, the lack of early game pressure allowing lvl 6 power junglers to just calmly build up to their power spike with very small interaction with the rest of the game, because they can just do a certain pattern of clear for a fast lvl 6 and then powerspike here we come.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Vexus","date":"2014-12-06T04:54:48.016+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"i just wanan know how the fark that even made it through pbe","replies":[]},{"poster":"Rav","date":"2014-12-04T08:05:55.907+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Wow, this idea is worse than what /r/leagueoflegends comes up with. Jesus christ OP. Remove his on-hit ult interaction? That's how you Olaf a champion.\n\nBest change would be to nerf Skirmisher's Sabre (the item that synergizes with him so well making him strong). Making it not on hit so high AS abusers like Udyr, Fiora, Yi and Warwick can't abuse it but instead making it a DoT (like red buff).","replies":[]},{"poster":"Slim Chaedi","date":"2014-12-04T06:04:20.698+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"While I agree that it sucks, it is preseason, where Riot admits stuff will be broken. He will be rebalanced before long anyway though.\nHowever, your suggestion of removing the on-hit part of his ult is an interesting idea. However, he'd need greater scaling perhaps in order to keep him from becoming too weak. Where he was last season was really good. He synergises too well with that single item though...\nIf anything though, even if the patch was far off I would not say disable Warwick. I would say disallow Warwick from purchasing that item (the red jungle item, I forget its name!).","replies":[]}]}
