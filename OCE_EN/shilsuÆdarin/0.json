He was about outplay and if people took 5 min to learn that players yasuo patterns they could win easily every time.\n\nFirst of all, most Yasuo's do walk up to enemies and start spamming away once they reached their first 3 levels. Their kit literally encourages that. Yasuo also doesn't have to always rely on outplaying to win, because it has enough flexibility and power budget to rush down many champions just fine in early levels, and in later stages of the game, he much like other carries, could kill anybody with 2 clicks.\n\nChampions designed specifically to \"outplay\" are made on the basis that their kit is inherently larger and/or more flexible than the others. And in order to balance that correctly, champs like these have to have limited scope of direct presence on the field. However, this is not what Riot usually does, and so we run into problems because of it. Yasuo's early isn't weak at all, because it's still hella better than say Yi (a champ with very similar overall concept) with ranged pokes, no resource management, low to non-existent CD across the board and vastly higher versatility than the 1 trick wuju, all while still scaling just as hard as him.\n\nOne can't argue that using \"ah it's okay because noobs can't do it well\", then what about those that could indeed execute the champs better? Do they get access to more possibility purely on the basis of their choice of champions?\n\nBeing able to \"outplay\" should be a downside and an upside, but it's not the case here in LoL, and so we shouldn't treat it as such purely because of principle reasons. There is a reason why you almost don't ever see the likes of Garen or Yi in Challenger or pro matches, and it's precisely because that they can't \"outplay\", as their kits are just handicaps in comparison to the likes of Yasuo or other \"outplay\" champions even in theory let alone in practice. I mean hell, Yi is essentially an inferior version of Yasuo at this point. \n\nNow as a disclaimer, I don't hate Yasuo, nor am I posting this for the purpose of bashing him or whatever. But I want to point out that \"XXX champ is all about outplay\" does NOT work in League because here, being about to \"outplay\" gives no disadvantage besides having more interactions to learn on the player's part as Riot has always been pretty unsure about how to balance the budget between flexibility and raw power. There is a reason why meta champs have dominated the pro scene for so long whenever there isn't a blatant OP balancing in the mix, because they're just fundamentally better across the board as merely having more rules to learn and play with is not a disadvantage, it's the opposite.","replies":[{"poster":"Talon12","date":"2017-01-01T10:49:38.301+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Oh I see the issue here.

What does that mean? Because he's absolutely useless there. It's not that Garen players can not climb to high elo, it's that high elo players can't play Garen because playing him is literally a self-handicap for the player in that level of play, due to the Riot's long-term poor balancing between versatility and raw power that gives the \"outplay champs\" high versatility by their virtue but also comparatively to just outright high raw power as well. There is a reason why the supposed \"outplay champs\" could still just spam buttons and still get kills in low to mid-tier matches just fine, and it's not because they lack raw power as a drawback from their high versatility. When their complexity is no longer a requirement nor does it come with a drawback, but instead the higher complexity is just a bonus, then there is a very real problem.\n\nI am not sure if I made it clear, the point was to refute the claim that \"only good yasuo's get snowballed as it was by outplaying\", which I explained in detail on why exactly the ideas may be so but it really isn't that in practice.\n\nBut whatever, let's just get on with our lives.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}
