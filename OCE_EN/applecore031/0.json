Have you tried restarting your client since the purchase as this usually helps.\n\nIf the RP still isn't showing up and you're sure you were charged you're going to have to [submit a ticket](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/requests/new) to player support as they're the only ones who can help with account related issues.","replies":[]}]}
