DON&#039;T BE SALTIER THAN THE BEARDED LADY&#039;S ARMPITS.\r\n\r\nOkay. Camille feels like an assassin. Even her name says it, Steel&#039;s Shadow. Seriously though, does every assassin have to be named after shadows?    {{champion:238}} is literally a shadow, so &quot;Master of Shadows&quot; makes sense.\r\n\r\n{{champion:84}} &#039;s title is &quot;Fist of Shadow.&quot; She has a shroud... I guess that&#039;s okay? she doesn&#039;t even really use her fists to fight though. (Can&#039;t Akali&#039;s title just be, the Twilight&#039;s Fists/Blade since her feel is about balance anyway). \r\n\r\n{{champion:91}} &#039;s title is &quot;The Blade&#039;s Shadow.&quot; I guess that also makes sense since he turns invis with his ult...? But doesn&#039;t it sound extremely similar Camille&#039;s title. &quot;The Blade&#039;s Shadow&quot; &quot;The Steel Shadow&quot;.\r\n\r\nZed&#039;s title, &quot;The Master of Shadows&quot; would sort of make him look like he&#039;s the master of all these shadow rip offs. \r\n\r\nI get that Camille works in the shadows and she&#039;s made of steel, but really... titles give feel to a character and repetition in titles sort of make them feel less special. I mean look at {{champion:40}} &#039;s title. What in heaven&#039;s name made you think she&#039;s furious and called her &quot;The Storm&#039;s Fury.&quot; She&#039;s a support for phreak&#039;s sake. \r\n\r\nWhat I would say is a wonderful example of a champion&#039;s title is {{champion:133}} &#039;s &quot;Demacia&#039;s Wings&quot; or {{champion:245}} &#039;s &quot;The Boy Who Shattered Time.&quot; I&#039;m not saying Camille&#039;s title isn&#039;t good. It really shows her working in the shadows and her being made mostly of steel, but maybe change it to something that fits her more. Maybe I&#039;m just really tired of seeing &quot;Shadows&quot; everywhere. Maybe it just annoys me how so many league titles don&#039;t match their champion&#039;s theme or lore.\r\n\r\n&quot;Camille, the Cog of Equilibrium&quot;\r\n&quot;Camille, the Steel Justice&quot;\r\n&quot;Camille, Piltover&#039;s Blades&quot;\r\n&quot;Camille, the Cog&#039;s Blades&quot;\r\n&quot;Camille, the Steel Stabilizer&quot;\r\n\r\nYou know, cuz she keeps the delicate balance in Piltover.\r\nThat&#039;s what she is. A hidden cog that keeps the delicate balance of the machine.","replies":[{"poster":"Lord Sesshomaru","date":"2016-11-22T05:12:07.421+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"**Moral of the story:** Theres too many fucking assassins in league.","replies":[{"poster":"xDarkRavenx","date":"2016-11-22T07:05:21.898+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Be amazed how many ninja and samurai like champions there are.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"DarkShade918","date":"2016-11-22T09:39:11.269+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Assassin's are known to hide in the shadows, how hard is that to understand, an assassin won't just casually walk into a throne room and fuck you up, s/he will sit in wait till the right time usually undiscovered by guards etc","replies":[{"poster":"Lord Sesshomaru","date":"2016-11-22T10:45:04.923+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=DarkShade918,realm=OCE,application-id=Ntey9fRZ,discussion-id=VvMUFAL3%%%%ment-id=0002,timestamp=2016-11-22T09:39:11.269+0000)\n>\nan assassin won&#x27;t just casually walk into a throne room and fuck you up, \n\nYou ever played Assassins creed?\nWalk into the middle of the room, chain-gun your pistols.
