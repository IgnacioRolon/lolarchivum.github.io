I&#039;m interested with how people use their cameras.\r\n\r\nI&#039;m a mix of the two. Locked most of the time because it&#039;s easier to follow my champion, but I often unlock to check parts of the map and observe the lane. I keep it unlocked in some situations where the distance between me and my laner is a bit far but I still have vision of them. Example is at bot lane (playing from blue side) when positioned near the red side bot brush and the laners are near the turret with minions out of range from the turret but just a few steps away from its range. I tend to position my camera  in between me and my laner, but with enough vision from the river in case of ganks.","replies":[{"poster":"TheHungryPerson","date":"2016-01-23T22:32:36.777+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Always unlocked with focus on champion bound to 'T'.

Once you're in the habit of using unlocked theres essentially no benefit in ever having it locked because it just limits your vision and awareness of the rest of the map, and would presumably make it harder to aim skillshots or click accurately while your champion is moving (which should be pretty much all the time). I also never use the function which centres the camera on your champion, though I can see how that has its uses.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Z3npachi","date":"2016-01-22T23:18:13.997+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Never have it locked.
