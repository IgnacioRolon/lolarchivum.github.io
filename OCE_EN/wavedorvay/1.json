Fishes (and a dude?) out of water. How about a water mage. Seriously you&#039;re not going to give one of the most powerful element (arguable) a mage? Nami ain&#039;t a mage. She can do a fair amount of damage, but no. \n\nThere are 7 Ice Champions. SEVEN. {{champion:20}} {{champion:34}} {{champion:201}} {{champion:127}} {{champion:48}} {{champion:113}} {{champion:22}}. What. Seriously. 2 Ice Mages, 3 Ice Tanks, and 1 Ice ADC. Frosty.\n\nWe have {{champion:1}} {{champion:63}}. Both Mages. Any thought of making a fire fighter (punz), or a fire tank, or a fire support 0.0? \n\nWe have 2 wind champions (I won&#039;t include Riven&#039;s &quot;wind&quot; magic or Galio&#039;s wind thingy). {{champion:40}} {{champion:157}}. We need more of these. Maybe a wind mage? Janna is a wind mage... but seriously... she has no daMAGE. Xerath is not a lightning mage.{{champion:101}}  is a mage mage. His magic is pure energy. (plasma? but that&#039;s not energy, that&#039;s matter. game logic.) Seriously though.. he is sort of a lightning mage. \n\nPlant champions 2. {{champion:143}} {{champion:57}}. Pretty good actually. Earth champions. I could say 3{{champion:54}} {{champion:44}} {{champion:72}}. All tanks. Makes sense. No other classes? Makes total sense (no sarcasm). They use rocks so yeah... So hard. That&#039;s what she said. \n\nJust some thoughts.","replies":[]}
