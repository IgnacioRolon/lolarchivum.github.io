I mean it doesn't even have to work on enemies for it to be a cool design it could just be used to swap allies in and out of battle IE Darius (Jump in, bait them to engage then swap positions with him and boom). The Champion could be balanced around that capability (weaknesses based on other situations that mean having that Champion and having them able to do such a strong thing would mean they would have to be squishy or something and maybe have less strength than 50% of Champions or something (balanced).","replies":[{"poster":"Zorphiax","date":"2015-10-17T03:02:58.736+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yay, more troll plays with switching allies into some retarded position while I get away free.\n\noh no, were getting chased I'll shove my ally behind while I keep running faster\n\nI'm sorry but thresh's lantern is the best way of transport for me. or bards magical journey.","replies":[{"poster":"Jink","date":"2015-10-17T03:46:27.978+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"So make it so that if you hit the #1 Key within 2 seconds it switches you back as a special feature of that Champion.\n\nThat way if someone trolls you, you are in control instantly and can deny them their troll.\n\nI know that might mean the potential for more balancing as it might make the Champion more powerful but it'd avoid the trolling potential.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Gravelord","date":"2015-10-17T01:18:02.812+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Drowranger?","replies":[{"poster":"Jink","date":"2015-10-17T01:22:12.290+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Arrows that slow have been in hundreds of games.\n\nJust like half the skills people say are stolen from Dota - are present in hundreds of different games.\n\nI think a Champion with a swap ability would be sick (but one like Vengeful Spirits, not Urgots swap) as in one that lets you swap with allies as well.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Æ’amous","date":"2015-10-16T21:56:21.083+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I don't think Riot would add a champion from another game, especially DOTA.","replies":[]}]}
