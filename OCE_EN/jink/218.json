Increase its AP scaling in early levels and reduce her other Ratios or something. It&#039;s unplayable and I like non-traditional playstyles so I&#039;m really disappointed in her as an AP right now, even though it used to be tremendously fun.\r\n\r\nIs there any chance we may see her buffed as an AP now that Deathfire Grasp has been removed? It wasn&#039;t always a core item on her but it helped her single-target combo immensely and now that it is gone and with the recent changes to her kit she is sub-viable as an AP =C","replies":[{"poster":"Lord Kylar Alice","date":"2015-04-24T02:54:32.172+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The point of changing Explosive Charge was to lessen the amount of AP Tristanas.
