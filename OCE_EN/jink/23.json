Flat AP outdoes it in pretty much all cases.","replies":[{"poster":"BarryButcher","date":"2015-05-03T17:25:59.777+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"it is literally the most cost efficient item in the game.

Which is what has been happening for years now, talking about BORK and TF btw, ever since Atmas was nerfed BORK and TF have replaced it.","replies":[{"poster":"sparklefart","date":"2015-08-03T02:52:43.797+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"undo, with that e, you are the new ad carry with many fasts","replies":[]},{"poster":"Jink","date":"2015-05-04T10:34:51.784+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"It was core on Sion because it gave AD based on HP and he had infinite HP gains and massive lifesteal so he could tank and still sustain effectively.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"kJs","date":"2015-05-04T00:48:18.964+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Yasuo built it sometimes when versing against Zed whilst not being fed. \nI think it worked well on Volibear as well.","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"sparklefart","date":"2015-05-04T04:56:53.385+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"{{champion:28}} Isn't it decent on her?","replies":[{"poster":"Chicken4dinner","date":"2015-06-28T15:40:41.219+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"and aatrox in certain builds","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"oops","date":"2015-05-04T06:56:08.011+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I forgot that item even existed to be honest.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Unseen Predator","date":"2015-05-04T00:45:20.014+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Actually the item has some good stats its just that other items provide better stats and are more consistent, the problem is there are no champions that will utilize both AP and AD, now you may say champs like Jax and Kayle which is true to a certain extent but it is much better to get an item that focuses on one stat, if i bought an AD item i would most likely get double the stats of what Rageblade's AD stat would give same goes for the AP, in other words why get a little bit of both stats when i can get a lot of one stat? A Jax benefits a lot more from buying BORK, TF and then tank than he would by buying Rageblade.","replies":[]},{"poster":"TouchMyKimchi","date":"2015-05-03T13:52:19.793+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"Just remove it me thinks Cousin.","replies":[]}]}
