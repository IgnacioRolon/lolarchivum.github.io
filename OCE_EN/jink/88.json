I guess by \"Aggressive play\" they meant \"Instantly one sided now stale for the rest of the game\" play.\n\nAlso in what should be an enemy laner with an advantage playing aggressively, Riot did not forsee that people would simply use this now heavily reduced farm benefit to: Rather than play aggressively; just abuse it and go ward hence making for incredibly stale matchups and gameplay.\n\nFair trades etc are more aggressive playing than simply zoning and warding and there's not a lot of itemization and countering to be had against \"zoning\" to make for: interesting play rather than \"I will zone you for the rest of forever cause that's more interesting than what was previously actually aggressive play\".\n\nThere is literally 0 fairness to it. Or fun.","replies":[{"poster":"Exhausted","date":"2015-06-16T02:55:59.227+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"WTF is this?","replies":[]}]}
