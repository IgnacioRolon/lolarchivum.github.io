You can&#039;t. You may as well tell them youre going to kill their family for feeding or whatever I mean it&#039;s basically just as offensive to me. I am actually less offended if someone starts flaming me and threatening to kill my family than if they tell me to go play bots because it&#039;s basically the same comment just worded differently.\n\nI mean where do you draw the line at something being abusive? Condescending, belittling, defaming - vilifying. The lines are all blurred when it comes to peoples method of expressing things because in all seriousness people can be saying to go play bots as a serious comment. I mean who intends things to be detrimental to another persons well-being?\n\nI know some of the most evil things in the world have been done with the best intentions but clearly if people have the mentality that being detrimental to others happiness or well-being is a good thing or enjoy it are mentally deficit and reporting them isn&#039;t going to cure their mental distortions so there&#039;s literally no point doing it; we&#039;re just doing it because of the 1 in a million chance that a report will wake them up to reality and fix their mental deficit or because we think they&#039;re mentally fine for doing/enjoying this kind of thing or don&#039;t have the best intentions in mind and aren&#039;t simply trying to express the seriousness of how much help you need. It&#039;s a bit hard to point out ten failings of an ally whilst playing a game and even after the game it&#039;s easier to say \"go play bots\" or \"Ez; you&#039;re sh*t\" than to sit there and explain 20 different item combinations and when to take what against who and almost just as complicated to say 5 different things they should practice or 20 different things they should learn about and \"get good nub\" is the only thing you can actually say in few words that indicates that you need to get better or could have done better.\n\nI mean what&#039;s the difference between saying \"You could have done better\" and \"You did sh*t\".\n\nThere is no difference - one just uses an expletive. I mean why not just say \"You did bad\"?\n\nPeople just use these words and Riot punishes people for them - much like they punish people for saying \"go get cancer\" and stuff like that and it&#039;s sad that people react so violently and emotionally towards comments that between friends are basically just fun antagonisms to criticise each other. People get comfortable using them or simply just use them and there is literally no reason they shouldn&#039;t be acceptable.\n\nThe people that say stuff like \"Go away\" in game actually annoy me more than the people that tell me to \"Go get cancer\" because they are literal and actual b*tches and try to fly under the radar as if they&#039;ve been successfully oppressed by society which I find saddening (like looking at a creature that&#039;s will has been broken) and honestly I hope the people that belittle and look down on others for using expletives and sayings that transfer literal and accurate points and opinions or feelings (You&#039;re sh-t - I hope you go get cancer etc):\n\nGo.\nGet.\nCancer.\n\nAlso f*ck Teemo I hope he dies in a fire.\n\nIt&#039;s really sad that people can&#039;t decipher what others are trying to express or don&#039;t understand the feelings they are expressing and why they are expressing them because really they&#039;re just pointing out your failings or calling you a failure.\n\nI mean if you disagree then by all means - point it out; and if you are: do something about it.\n\nStop crying to Mommy and the Riot police.\n\nI mean what&#039;s the worst that can realistically amount? Someone tracks you down and they can&#039;t decipher that when you said \"Die in a river\" they meant: \"Your build is sh-t\" or \"you play sh-t\" and \"go do something about it\" because if they&#039;re wrong - you should know and if they&#039;re right then you should do something about it hence their words should have no or a constructive impact and if someone in a worst case scenario tracks someone down because of something they said online and bashes them over it: grats - you just got bashed by a retard who couldn&#039;t decipher the meaning in your words: I bet you wont be doing that again (Talking to retards that is) which is why I have translated this \"Camouflaged language\" even though I probably needn&#039;t have - in the hopes it a) avoids this kind of outcome (can&#039;t do anything about retards though and Riot defends them for obvious reasons) and b) so that people will lighten up.\n\nI mean really. If Riot wants to defend retards and can&#039;t guaranteedly defend us from retards: they are retards hence shouldn't be allowed to implement power over our gaming with banning etc (affecting our input rather than giving output hence Illuminati).","replies":[{"poster":"Niji","date":"2015-06-23T15:00:40.763+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"***","replies":[{"poster":"Chicken4dinner","date":"2015-06-23T23:22:17.096+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Niji,realm=OCE,application-id=Ntey9fRZ,discussion-id=ozdJFhs6,comment-id=0002,timestamp=2015-06-23T15:00:40.763+0000)\n>\n> tl;dr for people who can't be fucked to read this\n\nYour forgot this bit\n \n> \"**_My_** Insults are actually constructive criticism so I shouldn't be banned for telling someone to get cancer\"","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"kJs","date":"2015-06-23T16:53:39.754+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Possibly the dumbest logic and person on the planet?
