Warmogs - out of combat heal (useful /sarcasm and he has %HP dmg) Deadman&#039;s - slow and he has anti-slow plus HP which he % dmgs and armor which he ignores with his true damage (Seen it before, armor is basically useless).\r\n\r\nThorn - ignored (and it was nerfed to crap) the return damage is 100% useless.\r\n\r\nGA - only option - trash tier item. (This item is overpriced, extremely situational and even then he ignores the armor and the passive is rarely useful unless all 5 people have it) plus that stats are bad.\r\n\r\nFrozen heart: situational and the slow is pathetic in most cases. Randuins - the slow is ignored by his ultimate (plus the attack speed slow since its a debuff not an aura) and the reduced crit dmg is useless plus the armor is ignored and the HP gives him more %dmg).\r\n\r\nSunfire: barely useful.","replies":[{"poster":"Corsage","date":"2015-12-13T10:42:41.410+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"And suprisingly Yi only have 50.32% win rate in the entire OCE sever.
