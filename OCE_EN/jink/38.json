He sits in a brush, wall flashes or Ghosts you in team fights - that's the extent of his skill ceiling, dodging skills is not necessary because everyone's just running because you become untargetable then kill someone in 0.2 seconds, or you occasionally do use your Q to dodge a skill, or intercept incoming nukes with W and that is the extent of the complicity of Yi.\n\nGhost or wall flash right click AFK.\nQ reset right click run around hitting people.","replies":[{"poster":"SEKAI","date":"2015-08-24T11:43:44.153+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Skill doesn't just lie in pressing buttons, for Yi, most of it are invisible.\n\nTo give you an idea, \n**If you have mastered Zed you have mastered the game, if you have mastered the game you have mastered Yi.**\n\nYi is a no brainer in B5, sure, but anything reks there if you have an idea on what's going on. So what about outside of B5?\n\n* Yi's engage, disengage, invulnerability and main damage source are all combined into 1 single spell with a gigantic CD unless he AA fast enough or kills somebody (after lvl 6). Determining how Q would be used requires comparing risk and reward.\n* His W can used to reset his AA, which can also be useful during duels to land that extra hit while blocking one, or as a general heal. But his heal stuns him, another risk and reward.\n* Yi can activate his E to get true damage, but he would lose its bonus AD when the spell in on cooldown. Another example of risk and reward.\n* He can activate his R and be unstoppable for a few seconds, but if he can't at least kill somebody during its activation to refresh his skills, he has no chance of escaping, Once again, risk and reward.\n\nYi's entire life is a constant risk and reward evaluation starting from level 1.\n\nLet's not even bring up how vulnerable he is pre 6, how fast he dies to a single CC that isn't a slow and the fact like half of the game's itemisations directly counters him.\n\nYi takes no skill?

It is like 1% of the game and you and Riot base so much on it, when in solo queue and with non-Skype teams, Yi is a noob champ and an OP champ that doesn't make it to LCS for the above reasons so Riot do nothing because not enough people are honest.","replies":[{"poster":"SEKAI","date":"2015-08-24T14:40:07.667+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Level1Pentakill,realm=OCE,application-id=Ntey9fRZ,discussion-id=tWvtkZwZ,comment-id=000500000000000000000000,timestamp=2015-08-24T14:07:03.148+0000)\n>\n> So they only play noob champs in tournies?\n\nYou do realise pros only play the most broken champs right (in tournaments)? Pros don't join tourneys to play games, they are there to win it.\n\nThe reason why Yi isn't picked outside of a few occasions (such as when he really was broken due to poor balance) is due to him not being effective and too easily exploited/shutdown. When Yi rolls high, he dunks everybody. And when Yi is countered, he becomes a garbage who happens to run very fast. That's Master Yi in a nutshell. He is way too high risk high reward centric no one is bothered to risk the chances in tourneys with him.\n\nAs a side note, there is also a reason to why pros almost always go for the most overloaded champs in tournaments. It's not because they are the \"most skillful champs\" for the sake of your entertainment but because those are the most effective and powerful, and it's not like Riot is unhappy keeping things that way. It's no conspiracy or rocket science to understand the situation.\n\nPros are not as noble as you might think, they are the same as wild animals when they are on the Summoner's Rift. It's not a bad thing, it's a good thing in fact (at least in the context of competition), but just don't give them too much credit for it.\n\n> Games not always about pro play,\n\nExcept games are meant to be balanced around high levels of play. It's not \"top\" level as it would be elitism and it can potentially push new-comers out, however every single game in existence generally strives to balance around a level that is relatively high, especially when it's supposed to be competitive. Otherwise the game isn't balanced at all and would just be a joke.\n\nThat's why Yi destroying nooblords in Bronze should not hinder his balance state, and he is by no means OP just because he rekt some people who don't know how to deal with him.\n\n___________\n___________\n\nYi is a fine champ and is perfectly healthy. Except in the very bottom of the elo ladder but that's to be expect, no one is balanced there anyway.\n\n**So get off your high horse and accept that there is nothing wrong with Yi.**","replies":[{"poster":"Jink","date":"2015-08-24T14:59:55.017+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"He hasn't been seen in pro play because he's not OP?\n\nLol they just pick chain CC comps and CC someone to death or AOE CC comps and wombo people to death.

Etc.\n\nNon pro play people don't do this.\n\nIn non pro play Yi is OP.\n\n1 He doesn't fit their Chain CC people to death ideology.\n2. He gets chain CC'd to death.\n\nBalancing around pro play in a game with 23 Quadrillion matchups in blind pick and over ten trillion skill combinations is like stabbing non pro players in the back by saying you should be skyping too with random people every day (millions of players) and that you should be doing this chain cc people to death setup too and it's also saying f*ck you to people who wanna solo queue without having too many OP solo queue champs to ban and without having to deal with Champs like this that require too much synergy and too many boring chain cc teams to beat.","replies":[{"poster":"SEKAI","date":"2015-08-24T16:19:01.761+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Level1Pentakill,realm=OCE,application-id=Ntey9fRZ,discussion-id=tWvtkZwZ,comment-id=00050000000000000000000000000000,timestamp=2015-08-24T14:59:55.017+0000) \n> In non pro play Yi is OP.\n\nStrictly speaking, only in low tier solo queue.\n\nBut yes, thanks for explaining why exactly he isn't OP. Even you acknowledge that he is especially vulnerable to any form of CC that isn't slow, and how when faced with too much CC he has no choice but to give up. Hence he isn't OP.\n\nI don't quite get what you're trying to talk about in the last paragraph considering there are no punctuation marks in the entire paragraph, making it near impossible to comprehend. But if you're arguing that games should be balanced around lower tier instead of high tier, then you're wrong. Because video games, like anything, should have a fair competition environment (unless it doesn't do pvp), which includes tournaments, it's as simple as that. Having a game purely centers around low tier matches would only make the game in pro scenes so hilariously unbalanced we might as well call them rigged. I am sure you understand.\n\nGames being unbalanced in low tier matches is not taken seriously because the \"unbalance\" there is always the result of player execution errors instead of simply the result of biased balance policy. Whereas if the game is unbalanced in high elo, it only means the game's balance state is trash. That's why games are balanced around higher plays instead of the lower one.\n\nYi really isn't broken, but I guess whatever.","replies":[{"poster":"Jink","date":"2015-08-24T16:33:31.407+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yi will be nerfed, calling it now.\n\n1. I merely said he isn't good against these comps, which are boring as f to play (malphite top is the worst) and these comps are a rarity through all leagues and poplularized in high tier play (a tiny fraction of its millions of users) hence he isn't popular there. Through all other tiers and divisions he is OP, throughout 90% of matches he is played in he is OP.\n\nI said games shouldn't be balanced based on high tier play because they really don't think outside the box and as soon as someone presents themselves as doing good damage they get nerfed and they slowly ruin all imbalance which is what makes the game about picks (picking people out and killing them quickly) and more about who can AOE sh*t storm the best or fastest while their is a tiny pick element remaining and DPS will vanish to CC and champs with good damage that aren't OP will get nerfed.","replies":[{"poster":"SEKAI","date":"2015-08-24T17:02:43.049+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Level1Pentakill,realm=OCE,application-id=Ntey9fRZ,discussion-id=tWvtkZwZ,comment-id=0005000000000000000000000000000000000000,timestamp=2015-08-24T16:33:31.407+0000)\n>\n> Yi will be nerfed, calling it now.\n\nLet's be real here tbh, you hate him not because he is truly unbalanced but because you got rekt by him in the past. \n\nFine nerf him, it's not like Yi is virgin to being nerfed unjustly by noobs, in fact he has been raped by them so many times I am sure he got desensitised already.\n\n> I said games shouldn't be balanced based on high tier play because they really don't think outside the box \n\nAgain let's be real, LoL is never known for its brilliant state of balance. It's not that pros don't think outside the box, they simply aren't allowed to in their level as the balance up their is 1 dimensional-ly broken, considering Riot is actually balancing the game according to low tier matches just as you wanted, making top tier matches 0 in diversity and no one can do anything about it. \n\nOf course, you can always try other comps there, sure, enjoy losing though.\n\n_____________\n\nI doubt any amount of nerfs would appease your nonsensical prejudice against him, you clearly just want him gone, even though he is one of the most balanced champ in the entire game. \n\nHigh vulnerability, high damage.
