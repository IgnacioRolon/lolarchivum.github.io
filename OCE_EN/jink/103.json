I don't have room for more than 2 support pages even though there's lots I would use, I have a tank jungle page (1) and that's like - barely useful on a lot of the Champs I would like to be able to play.\n\n\nNot having specific rune pages sets certain Champs back so much I wont even play them in normals while I have a certain set of pages up...","replies":[]}]}]}
