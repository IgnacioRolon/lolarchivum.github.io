After they nerfed the Deathfire Touch mastery, it left most mages (and some other champions) with no other viable keystone mastery except Thunderlords. Maybe once the meta develops more, we'll see a shift away from it, but for now, it doesn't look like much will be changing unless the keystones are tweaked a bit.","replies":[{"poster":"Olee","date":"2015-12-23T04:41:08.242+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Deathfire Touch so far, has recieved a buff and a nerf. It took a hit to it's damage over time period, making the damage come in slower, hurting you in all ins. But, it got a slight damage nerf. To be honest, Deathfire never stood a chance against Thunderlords for the majority of the mages in the game. It's a niche pick for sustained single target champs and DoT champs.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Bookbash","date":"2015-12-23T00:54:47.198+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Olee,realm=OCE,application-id=Ntey9fRZ,discussion-id=N4tKMmkZ,comment-id=0001,timestamp=2015-12-22T22:33:27.486+0000)\n>\n> Ok, firstly, I think Thunderlord's is balanced.
