I mean it&#039;s basically saying &quot;remake&quot; or &quot;I&#039;m out, you guys queue without me&quot; whereas leaving in game is saying &quot;screw you guys&quot; or &quot;im a fkn noob at interewebs&quot;.","replies":[{"poster":"Jolyne Cujoh","date":"2015-09-09T08:40:52.624+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"People kinda don't like having to sit in champ select for a minute in norms or 3 minutes (or whatever it is) in ranked just to get kicked out because of some guy who decides he doesn't want to play","replies":[{"poster":"Jink","date":"2015-09-09T09:22:14.581+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"People kinda don't like being punished for dodging trolls especially when you are banned for 20 minutes if you have 2 troll queues in a row - just so that people feel better about waiting another 3 minutes for a team knowing that someone got a personal f-ck you from Riot.\n\nWhere the f-ck is the fairness in that?\n\nThen you get back and there's another f-cking troll and you may as well just not play for the whole day - yeah, that's really fair.\n\nAll so the people waiting another 3 minutes for a game feel good, knowing some poor c-nt who had an obligation or duty to dodge got punished for it, for dipping in and affecting 3 minutes of your life.\n\nWow.\n\nNo wonder africas starving - people don't give a f-ck as long as their own sh-t keeps turning.","replies":[{"poster":"Veryhungryperson","date":"2015-09-11T16:12:50.733+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Originally queues had no dodge punishments. However they were implemented because it would take upwards of 30 minutes sometimes to find a game that everyone was happy with. People weren't dodging to avoid trolls they were dodging because they didn't get the champion/position/teammates they wanted. It also led to situations where lobbies were held hostage to the will of 1 person because they would just dodge and re-queue.\n\nAdmittedly the current system is not perfect but I doubt any system Riot implements will do much better. I've seen suggestions for disband lobby votes but that becomes open to abuse, creating massive skews towards the power of premades in normal queues, ie Don't play that or we kick you, and reducing competitive diversity in ranked queues, ie First pick didn't ban (Insert current OP here) gg, troll, kick!\n\nAs for Africa, it is true, people are less affected by events outside their environment, you can read more about the concept [here](http://www.cracked.com/article_14990_what-monkeysphere.html)","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"GigaPube","date":"2015-09-10T05:13:16.456+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"because then everyone would dodge queue when they didnt get their lane. but man ive seen this shit so many times and its been going on for how long and riot still dont do anything about it. they just chuck out more shitty chroma packs for us to throw our money at","replies":[]},{"poster":"Essembie","date":"2015-09-09T08:28:48.351+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I agree.  There needs to be a system in place to discourage trolling by repeated dodging but boy it escalates quickly (5 30 60 for ranked).\n\nMyself i get limited windows to play so if i dodge one or get a dc at the wrong time then my evenings play is over.\n\nAgree with some sort of system to discourage dodging but man it is unforgiving.","replies":[]}]}
