There are so many users in League of Legends, so it is pretty unrealistic for Riot to be able to weed out the bad guys, but what do you really want to do; punch them in the face?\n\nAre they abusing you because they know you? No, they&#039;re abusing you over a Video Game.\n\nWhat losers. Why would you let this bother you to the point that you tell your friends about it?\n\n\"I got abused on the interwebs today\".\n\nHoly f-ck welcome to the real world, I get chased down the street with Cricket bats because people decided to try and rob me and my friend. That&#039;s a real world problem. Getting all amped up and sooky about someone calling you a sh-t c-nt over a video game is pathetic.\n\nYou should be left to fend for yourselves. If anything, your anonymity should be taken away and I guarantee you half these dogs would bust their wholes lest I rock up to their house and I&#039;m pretty sure half the f-cking losers would stop sh-t talking if there were real world consequences - but there aren&#039;t.\n\nNo one wants some deranged psychopathic twelve year old kid rocket up to their house with a pencil because you walk out that door and you now have a pencil in your eye because you called him sh-t and he didn&#039;t like it.\n\nThis is what people are like. The more you antagonise them - the worse it gets in the world because people can&#039;t express themselves personally over the internet so they are forced to bottle things up and when it comes to real world sh-t - like you taking pokes at them as a person rather than their in-game choices (you make things personal) you deserve to be permanently banned by your I.D - but you cannot be, you will merely have to start from level one again so it is literally societies job to ignore them and move on because you will never give them the reaction they want (They hate you and want you to feel bad for being sh*t at the game and costing them ELO) and all they want is to upset you or drag you down with them so if you just shut your mouth, stopped crying which antagonises people and reported them and moved on there would be no problem.\n\nThe reason crying about people doesn&#039;t help is because your only solution is that they are a retard and you are 100% perfect and did fine in game and there was nothing wrong with you and they are some deranged twelve year old who wants to stab you in the eye with a pencil and you are so low that you have to f-cking cry to someone about a deranged twelve year old abusing you over the internet threatening to stab you in the eye with a pencil.\n\nIf what they say has no merit, why are you complaining about a deranged twelve year old who wants to stab you in the eye with a pencil when you should be feeling sorry for how pathetic they are and moving on.\n\nInb4 deranged twelve year olds who want to stab people in the eye with pencils want to stab me in the eye with a pencil for calling out that their only fun in life is having people react to their bullsh-t and seeing you crying on the forums (those sweet tears) about how they said you f-ck your mum every night makes their f-cking day because your tears are so sweet.\n\nPlease stop feeding them.\n\nGrow the f-ck up.\n\nStop crying, it&#039;s their f-cking sustenance.\n\nRealise who the f-ck you are dealing with, don&#039;t f-ck with the deranged twelves year olds who want to stab people in the eyes with pencils, just keep your f-cking distance, accept the ELO loss, report them to the nearest mother-cker who has eye protection and a TAZER and a waiting kennel and move on with your lives for f-ck sake.\n\nEvery f-cking day I swear there are more tears and less intelligence on the boards about ranked trolls and sh-t and it&#039;s making the trolls worse because they are so sustained from the tears and so in tune with your suffering that in their deranged pencil stabbing in the eye personalities somehow they have received attention, hope or a reminder of who they are, or somehow you are the sustenance of their deranged mentalities because obviously they want to abuse you so it makes sense that they f-cking enjoy unless they&#039;re just that deranged so you&#039;re either wasting your f-cking time trying to deal with their distorted mentality when you should just shut the f-ck up and move on, or you are encouraging them.\n\nAnd please don&#039;t f-cking encourage them.\nPlease don&#039;t f-cking cry about them because it is probably a form of sustenance to see you suffering since it is on their list of things they do, so they probably do f*cking enjoy it and seeing people on this board crying just f-cking pi--es me off because I know they enjoy being deranged twelve year olds so they probably enjoy the outcomes which are either tears or anger and if they don&#039;t enjoy it and are just that mentally distorted that they abuse people for no reason, why are you crying to other people like they&#039;re gonna care that some deranged twelve year old has it in for you - because if you are that f-cked up that you let a deranged twelve year old get to you - I&#039;d hate to see how you deal with the other mother-ckers in the real world that actually will bash you for 20c, or will break into your house and beat the sh-t out of you on a whim, because while you are here getting sooky because deranged twelve year old number 56 f-cked up your elo, or f-cked up your game - people are dying and getting bashed in the streets over comments, over nothing - and you are basically completely safe on the internet so it&#039;s the perfect place to analyse the human race and all I see are f-cking cry babies and ragers 24/7 with no one learning and all I see is a world where all your rights have been taken away, because not only are you so low you bash people for money, or for fun - even when you are on the internet, 100% safe you even start getting abusive and start crying over a f-cking video game.\n\nGrats bro, it could earn you money and they could be in the way of that.\n\nSo how exactly do you plan on dealing with people f-cking up your day over the internet, when these are the same people from the real world - with 0 actual consequences to their actions?\n\nYou don&#039;t - because if people want to f-ck up your day they will just do so under the radar and get the same enjoyment out of it and the internet empowers them.\n\nCrying doesn&#039;t help. You&#039;re either feeding them their sustenance which is your tears, or you&#039;re wasting your f-cking energy so please just stop.\n\nEvery.\nF-cking.\nDay.","replies":[{"poster":"raluca2","date":"2015-09-01T14:50:19.261+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"TL;DR ~~soz~~\n\nBut I understand the point you are trying to convey, and I agree with you entirely, although there are some people that can be sensitive to these things and we've got the respect that.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Essembie","date":"2015-09-01T14:00:05.823+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Tldr","replies":[]},{"poster":"KrimsonDeath","date":"2015-09-01T14:47:05.551+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"TL;DR {{champion:17}} {{champion:74}} {{champion:223}} {{champion:432}} ","replies":[]},{"poster":"SEKAI","date":"2015-09-01T14:29:07.283+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Idk about you but this OP seems like it could have been reduced to a quarter or more while still maintaining its effectiveness without sounding too whiny.\n\nI can agree with what you're trying to say however.","replies":[]}]}
