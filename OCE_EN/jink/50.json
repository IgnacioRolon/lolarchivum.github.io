With Righteous Glory+Stun+Tibbers it's a massive AOE stun that **almost impossible to dodge** <--- that's the reason she's so popular as a support. Ranged point and click stuns aren't abundant in League, but they are ridiculously good and reliable, which is why Annie is often played in the support position. You can flash Sej, Gragas, Braum, Leona ult. Have fun flashing Annie stuns.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Chicken4dinner","date":"2015-06-03T13:57:35.866+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"zyra and lux duo is hilarious, they just keep you in one spot while zyra's plants get her kills","replies":[{"poster":"SorakaXHealBoT","date":"2015-06-03T14:04:00.188+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Morgana and Lux tho","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Bipolar","date":"2015-06-03T11:57:35.457+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Have you ever versed a Leona + Braum lane?
