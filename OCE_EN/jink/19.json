I can&#039;t trigger it in between roaming because you need an ally nearby so come mid-game it&#039;s basically a useless item: This is why I normally don&#039;t get face of the mountain; because I feel like a Major part of that item is having the 4 procs on minion waves and I feel like by the time you&#039;ve got it - in most games; laning phase is over and you could have had a banner, Locket, Righteous Glory or a tank item - with far better statistics instead and all that gold for just 1 extra proc with no change to the gold acquired like by upgrading relic into Targon's - seems wasted when considering the stats other items provide.","replies":[{"poster":"Jehovahs Witness","date":"2015-09-15T02:14:31.557+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It can be a life saving item.","replies":[]},{"poster":"BarryButcher","date":"2015-09-14T22:32:44.634+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Most supports can 1-hit caster creeps mid-late game with targons execute.
