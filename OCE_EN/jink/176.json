It felt unfair and he obviously steamrolled us completely but surprisingly, even though he was that ahead, if we bring some good cc and lock him down so he cant pick his axes up, we can easily 3v 1 him. Keep in mind, this is a snowballing draven so a 1v1 or even a 2v1 is out of the question. Without his axes, his damage is mediocre.\n\nAlso draven's trading power is really strong but he's like a completely single target melter. Sure his stand aside and his ult is multi target but those arent the reason why draven is so strong. Shut him down early with a gank from your jungler and he wont be able to snowball. You see the longer draven goes without dying, the more dangerous it is to die to him. And draven's snowball potential is only really unlocked with kills because of his passive. Meaning he *has* to play risky to snowball in any way. He also has very little utility.\n\nLaning against him is a pain but if he got nerfed he wouldn't ever be viable. Picking draven into a game means you're either really confident with your skills and you believe you can snowball, or it means your bot lane is gonna feed hard.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Azirious Mistake","date":"2015-08-12T22:45:49.025+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hes feast or famine, much like some of your most played champs, Riven, Kat or, too a lesser extent, Vayne. If he gets ahead then he will steamroll you and theres nothing you can do to stop it but hes somewhat short ranged and if you have a pick champion like Morgana, Blitz or Thresh aim your skillshot to where his axe is going to fall and its a free kill or if he has a brain in his head he won't risk it and he loses 85% of his main damage output and it gives you a window to engage on him. Lets put it this way, Draven is only OP if his Spinning Axes are up.\n\nEDIT: I had to stalk your lolking to pluck a few examples","replies":[]}]}
