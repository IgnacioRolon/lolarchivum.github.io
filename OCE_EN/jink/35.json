There are things you can do to prevent dying to them, it's not as if Riot makes champions to troll people and say \"hahaha look at them, they can't do anything against them.\" I understand some champions are a pain/hassle to deal with, but you're saying a select few are OP? No. As stated before, every champion is OP in their own unique way, every champion is good at something another is not, and every champion lacks something another has. Learn to deal with it and have fun, otherwise don't play League. You can't go around saying \"nerf this champion, nerf that about that specific champion\" otherwise what's the incentive to play that champion?","replies":[{"poster":"Talon12","date":"2015-10-03T09:16:47.140+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"*Remembers juggernaut skarner release*","replies":[{"poster":"Zorphiax","date":"2015-10-03T10:31:08.910+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"remove his crystals and no one will play him for a while expect like 50 people.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Zorphiax","date":"2015-10-03T08:11:43.825+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Even Yorick is op.","replies":[{"poster":"Talon12","date":"2015-10-03T09:17:31.806+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yorick is broken in a sense, he is just so underrated no one says anything","replies":[{"poster":"Zorphiax","date":"2015-10-03T10:30:00.220+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"When versing Yorick:\n\n1 look up guides on how to beat yorick for 30 minutes.\n2 get flamed at for being afk and not going to lane.\n3 complain Yorick is op and suffer with 20 min bans for being afk in game.\n\n:(","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Jink","date":"2015-10-03T08:57:22.169+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"How do you buff the unplayed Champions?
