The same with Itachi/Kisame in naruto, Kisame looks like a big brutish warrior, and itachi is a thin little guy, yet he is by far the more terrifying.\n\nThe same is true for lamb/wolf, It'd be a lot more eerie and freaky to turn around and see lamb sitting still on a rock right behind you staring at you, than see wolf running through the forrest at you.\n\nLuckily we don't have to think about this because they are always together.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Azirious Mistake","date":"2015-10-20T22:28:13.553+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Lamb seems the logical choice unless you want to die a slow and painful death.","replies":[]},{"poster":"KoiSarina","date":"2015-10-20T15:54:16.179+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Lamb chops and Wolf packs.","replies":[]},{"poster":"GigaPube","date":"2015-10-20T14:20:28.660+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"list of champs id rather see pop out of a brush in the jungle over kindred\n\nsoraka\nsona (if nobody ends up backing her up)\nsame with taric\nyorick\n\n\nthat is all","replies":[]},{"poster":"SEKAI","date":"2015-10-20T14:09:18.513+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Ofc you wanna see Wolf, they taste better than Lamb.","replies":[]}]}
