(Last whisper).\n\nI'm not as educated about Liandry's but I disagree on it only being for Champions with DoT's (Teemo and Brand) because Brand gets engaged on heavily and Teemo has to have map dominance for it to be effective and as such these Champs miss out on having as much benefit from it as others who can utilise it more effectively but with a little more effort (like kat poking for example or Ahri as she can poke a fair bit and get a few procs - especially on tanks - during trades etc) and as such I think it is a good buy as you can easily grab Haunting Guise which adds nice stats and eases pressure on AD's as enemies have to consider buying mixed resistances - and as a precursor to Luden's, Deathcap or Morello's/Chalice it is easy to build into once enemies have built HP or can be left in it's earlier stage - and adds a lot of impact to team fights and poking etc once built - which is much needed in League atm - and with many tanks and a lot of AP bursters nerfed and with deathfire removed and with a predominance of and significant danger because of the impact Tanks/bruisers can have if they aren't taken down relatively quickly or poked/deterred from engages or heavy engages etc I think it's an item that's often overlooked and at the expense of games.\n\nEasy to build early - easy to upgrade if need be - and still a good item if left unfinished - and in relation to blade of the ruined king - great stats added, significant impact on tanks and bruisers and still useful in ADC trades etc, great with a lot of supports taking HP related items too and even still - good if they don't because it has such nice and balanced stats. I don't know why anyone would not consider taking these items when vs'ing 2 or 3 tanks, tanky bruisers, potential tanks, HP benefitting champions or when general teams tank up late game and if you have a lot of burst its often a good idea as a pre-emptive and it's often easy to see tank teams incoming - the item does a lot more than a lot of other item choices, its a generally safer choice and almost any ADC can take it with ease - and many AP's can take Haunting Guise and almost always gain a lot out of it - and if not it is still better to have in a lot of cases where enemies look like they may tank - and I know there are a few tank buster Champions or Champs that deal % HP damage or have %HP missing Executes (Poppy, Riven, Garen, Lee Sin, Mundo, Elise - but in cases where you are vsing 2-3 tanky champs and don't have 2 of these Champs on your team - Items like Liandry's and Blade of the Ruined King are great early or even late additions to your builds - and even if you do are still often greatly beneficial.","replies":[{"poster":"JasonWazza","date":"2015-04-24T11:11:52.076+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Tank =/= Health Tank\n\nWhat your not taking into account in any of this is the fact that your only\na) talking about health tanks with 0 resistances\nb) not even considering resistances.\n\n>6% of 1000 is 60 dmg on hit at the point at which they're at 1000 health - once they hit around 2000 to 2400 that's 120-145 dmg so for the duration of chunking them down from 2.4K health you'll be doing 145 dmg for the first few hits, then about 100 once they start losing hp then about 60 bonus dmg once they hit around 1K health - and you have an execute based on max HP which helps you kite as well (useful vs tanks).\n\nHere's a more realistic example\n\n2400 health, 100 armor, this means your dealing 72.5 bonus damage, take into account the fact that 100 armor is actually a small amount (an AP mid building Zhonya's can get them to 100) and you start realizing that your talking out your ass.\n\nI'm not saying blade is a bad item, i'm saying that your being truly bronze in your assumption.\n\nLets take the same sort of enemy and consider the 35% armor pen and give them a last whisper instead\n\n2400 health, 100 armor dropped to 65, assuming you have 200 AD, your looking at going from 100 damage, to 121 damage, and this scales harder off your AD, and procs on things OTHER then Auto's\n\nFact is several champions don't scale as hard off the AS blade gives, and for them Last Whisper is the more realistic option to being able to shred tanks, especially if you take into account the armor that they are going to have.\n\n\n\nAs for Liandry's, it's a completely gold inefficient as an item, which is why you need DoT's to proc it effectively (the fact that you only mention brand and teemo is just pathetic.)\n\nDo you want to know what the difference between liandry's and Haunting Guise is?\n\n5 AP (because you need to buy an amp tome which can be turned to something else)\n100 HP\nThe Liandry's Passive\n980 gold\n\nRead this a few times.\n\nNow that it's sunk in lets go to what you actually get from the passive.\n\n2% current health per second for 3 seconds.\n\nLets bring back in 2400 health assuming you do a proc on someone with no MR and they stay at full health, you did 141 damage over those 3 seconds\n\nFor that 980 gold i can get a blasting wand for 40 AP and probably do more damage with the flat AP scaling off my ability's on nearly any mid laner.\n\nUnlike the blade that actually ends up paying for the stat inefficiency, Liandry's doesn't unless you are a Malz, Cassio, Singed, Amumu, Brand, Rumble, Swain\n\nAll of these can proc the Liandry's for a prolonged amount of time, and actually make the item become cost efficient.","replies":[{"poster":"Jink","date":"2015-04-24T12:36:04.660+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I know I was talking about before Resistances but it's easy to see that your endgame damage output is better vs tanks with Blade of the ruined King than its counterparts.\n\nIt's a counter to tanks and you're basically saying don't buy it -

I'm not surprised her win rate in games where last whisper has been purchased is higher than her blade of the ruined king games as Last Whisper is most often a late game item - which is where Vayne shines.\n\nBlade offers stats useful versus non-HP heavy Champions too which is also why it is often taken earlier; as a deterrent to HP stacking, as an item to deal with Champions with high HP scaling or to counter those who will buy HP regardless - as even if they don't - it's stats are still great.\n\nYour blade will only be doing sh*t all if you don't pick up a last whisper as well versus 2 or so armor stackers with high HP or HP items.\n\nI can guarantee you your Infinity Edge will be doing sh*t all versus a 4K HP Mundo and a 3K HP Jarvan - and to add importance to the item, Champions like that often buy Thornmail and the lifesteal on Blade helps counter thorn - so there is an added bonus to taking it as most HP stackers consider armor - thorn being a common choice - and blade deters and helps deal with this and thorn doesn't return the %bonus damage- however on the flip side; that attack speed from blade is less useful against a randuins however on the flipside again as randuins is a sustain type item Blade is still more useful versus it in a lot of situations than an Infinity Edge as randuins adds a lot of HP adding to your blade damage.\n\nInfinity Edge is often an item taken if you are leading, being replaced by bloodthirster in games where you need more duelling potential, to be able to stick in lane longer vs powerful harassers and as a more defensive option for if you are struggling in lane - it being a high win rate item is probably simply because it is often an item taken once you are in the lead - hence probably more likely to win that game.\n\nI don't know why you're comparing Void and Liandry's - the items work well together - It's an item that will often replace a low AP item in your inventory and I'm not saying it's great but it shreds tanks and I think it and blade are items often not considered as useful -
