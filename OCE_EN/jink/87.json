I think it overheats from the constant usage and after 2-3 years it just fails to connect to our own network, which I had to find out the hard way. We switched it up to the newly upgraded Belkin, which to be fair wasn't much better. It's starting to act up again *sigh*.\n\nAnyways back to the Singed changes, he's definitely going to be a menace top lane, but at least Riot didnt buff Teemo. Of wait, the Ap changes buffs Teemo as well. Great.
