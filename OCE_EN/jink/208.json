It is Unholy, I know but I personally don't like Archangels, preferring early aggression (I take Double Doran's on a lot of Mages) and feel a lot of Money is wasted on Morello's and in building the stats you lose a lot of Early game - and often it's the only CDR & mana option suitable (if you aren't versing a lot of magic damage if any substantial magic damage at all) and Mikael's stats really don't live up to AP Mid's requirements.\r\n\r\nI think an AD vs'ing CDR & mana item could be balanced (without ruining AD's early game too much where they need to be able to farm and trade with you) but with a decent mana pool late game for Champions who need the CDR and mana for quick bursty pushes down mid \r\n(Ahri, Azir, maybe Morgana - etc) and maybe even another AD CDR item could be added to balance this out, with a tanky heal/time item and maybe a heal shred item for supports that isn't so mana intensive and maybe some form of hybrid AP or sustain type item for AD/AP assassin (IE spell vamp on an AD item and lifesteal on an AP item or something like that).\r\n\r\nI don't know, I think it's worth a thought as I've found AP Mids often need this form of item and the other item types I  mentioned might help balance it out.","replies":[{"poster":"Fog","date":"2015-03-25T22:46:38.315+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Double Morello AP Ashe Mid. 2 Second W OP.","replies":[]},{"poster":"She Loves Me","date":"2015-03-26T04:27:05.096+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"you dont need mana items if you have double dorans and you can last hit.
