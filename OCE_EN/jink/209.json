Having to put a level into a skill before you can see if taking a differnt skills is more appealing is a bit annoying (In case you don't have their per level increases memorised or whatever).","replies":[{"poster":"Zero Infinity","date":"2015-03-26T01:34:38.884+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I like this idea.\nSo maybe when you hover over it's a Lol Wiki style were the stats are 1pt /2pt/ 3pt /4pt / 5pt","replies":[]},{"poster":"Lord Kylar Alice","date":"2015-03-26T06:35:19.190+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It's because when you first level up the skill, you're learning it, and it's showing you what learning it will give you.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Daen","date":"2015-03-25T19:15:10.255+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'm confused as to what you're asking.  When leveling an ability, you can hover over the plus sign to see what numerical changes will happen.  It'll show you everything from damage to utility to cooldown, and each available ability will show this information.","replies":[{"poster":"Jink","date":"2015-03-25T21:46:06.506+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Not when first levelling up the skill, it doesn't show bonuses on extra levels in the skill when you mouseover (say you're comparing out of 2 skills; which to level 1st and you want to know how it scales with levels) until you are mousing over on putting a 2nd level into the skill (then it shows scaling ie what bonuses you get for each level in the skill).","replies":[{"poster":"Daen","date":"2015-03-25T23:55:32.723+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Ah, I see what you're saying.  A feature like that might lessen clarity since that would be a ton of information to see when levelling a skill, and people generally start with certain abilities due to their function rather than their scaling.  By level 3 it's irrelevant regardless, I just have trouble seeing the value-add here.\n\nWhat are some scenarios in which you would need to see that information to make an informed decision?  As an example, if I were playing Lux I'd start with whichever ability I feel like I want then get the other two as I go.  Maybe I want my snare first for an early engage and my slow second for faming, then my shield third; the scaling of those abilities doesn't matter, I just want whatever innate functionality it provides.","replies":[{"poster":"Jink","date":"2015-03-26T02:11:16.511+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yeah, it might be too much info on the screen but it would be mainly so that I can quickly level a skill at 4 and have double checked and know the boost I will be getting so that I can go for clutch outdamage or out-movespeed scenarios or baits etc and not being able to double check values impedes this, you have to know the Champions values and scaling 100% or simply wait for later levels to check whether those values would have saved you or whatever and sometimes I might clutch level a different skill than normal to do this.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}
