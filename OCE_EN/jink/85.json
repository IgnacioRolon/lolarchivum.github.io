You don't have to follow the cookie-cutter Hurricane build just because it's usually strong. When you know you're against Malph + Maokai from the start, consider rushing BotRK into Ghostblade and LW. Also, your CS was terrible. You should have had 2-3 times the farm you ended up with in a game that length. If you had twice the CS, you would have had at least another item. That would have made a large difference in damage.\n\nIt's easy to scoff and claim \"this guy was too tanky, of course I won't be dealing damage to him\" but sometimes you need to consider whether or not you could have made a difference through your own actions.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Unseen Predator","date":"2015-05-13T12:39:00.585+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"# #  Tankmeta","replies":[]}]}
