And well done with the new jungle; played it a fair few times and found it very cool; and last but not least, thanks for providing such a great game and maintaining it - free of Charge!\n\n-Kistorm.\n\"Buff ADC's, Supports OP!\"","replies":[{"poster":"Sackboy","date":"2015-03-15T14:36:24.178+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"Start playing freelosandra, you'll be outta bronze in no time.","replies":[{"poster":"Jink","date":"2015-03-15T14:46:07.790+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I play her but not sure whether to Top or Mid, got good level 6 presence in mid but as a top laner I think her kit dominates lane but leaves her in a boring game.","replies":[{"poster":"BarryButcher","date":"2015-03-15T23:44:48.501+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"thats why top laners take TP and TP bot a lot.
