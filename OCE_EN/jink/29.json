Either way he is either going to have to fight Renekton or run in and take Harass while he tries to kill a heap of minions or miss out on XP and each wave meeting will stick around that point 1000 units from his turret and Renekton can keep the wave bigger than his own to maintain it stays around this point by simply doing nothing but stop Darius being able to push it, or get away with pushing it.\r\n\r\nThis usually doesn&#039;t end well and if Renekton quickly kills a few minions in between standing between them and Darius he can keep the lane this way - for a very. long. time. Basically indefinitely.\r\nDarius is either forced to sit back and he will gain 0 experience or fight Renekton who has a Gold and Level advantage from the gank.\r\n\r\nSo if you&#039;re going to play League of Legends I highly advise you learn about things like this and practice lane freezing and zoning because even though it isn&#039;t always in this kind of scenario where an ally causes an opponent to gain an easy lane freeze - people will often implement this strategy and it can cause you some serious difficulties and if you are aware of it there are many ways to avoid it. Once it&#039;s too late for you to counteract you may as well suicide dive the minion wave to clear it and cause a lane reset (Where the minions are equalized and the enemy can&#039;t zone as effectively or has to choose between killing minions or missing minions to be able to keep you from gaining XP. This is a highly effective strategy and simply ramboing a creep wave to force yours to push in repeated efforts (often costing you your life) is about all you can do to counteract it because once it&#039;s happened you basically have to push your wave under their turret so that their turret kills your minions quickly and then their wave will be bigger and push to your turret - counteracting their ability to zone and allowing you to at the very least force them to take turret aggro to be able to harass you or stop you from gaining minion XP and occasional minion kills safely.\r\n\r\nAlso being lane frozen sets you up for easy ganks if they do choose to keep the lane frozen and aren&#039;t excellent at zoning and counteracting it sets the enemy up for easy ganks however it can be difficult to maintain the freezing of your own lane once you have counteracted it by killing their small wave and forcing yours under their turret and you will have to most likely tank some minion aggro or harass to keep it frozen or counteract the freeze and against an enemy with an advantage this can be very difficult.\r\n\r\nPotions can be worth their weight in gold for helping you - in unfavourable or out-scaled and dis-advantaged matchups against lane freezing and at the very least help you gain levels and a few possible minions. The advantage of making your enemy overextend or have to take turret aggro - to be able to harass you or last hit minions and have to fight you or take your harass to be near minion experience range is incredible and perfecting lane freezing can help you absolutely destroy your lane opponents and being familiar and practiced in when and how to do it can help you win many games and matchups.","replies":[{"poster":"csm","date":"2015-06-28T05:30:03.947+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"You can most definitely still gain EXP while the lane is frozen.","replies":[{"poster":"Jink","date":"2015-06-28T07:52:50.450+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The point is if people know what lane freezing and zoning are they are more likely to avoid the entire conundrum in the first place and not cause other people or themselves to be in a situation where they are going to miss out on minion kills and most likely experience as well.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Only Heimer","date":"2015-06-28T00:09:34.044+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"tl;dr","replies":[{"poster":"Jink","date":"2015-06-28T07:51:37.588+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"tl;dr.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"McRuthless","date":"2015-06-28T01:18:28.676+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"While I agree with most of what you said, suiciding to unfreeze the wave is a terrible idea. That will just put you so far behind that you're gunna get zoned even after the wave has reset. You should ask the jungler to come help you push the wave in. Failing that, roaming to get your teammates ahead can sometimes be effective. Giving the enemy more kills for minimal benefit to you will make it much harder for your teammates to make up for the deficit and carry you","replies":[]}]}
