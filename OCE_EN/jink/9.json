Or the Asian culture of eating dog meat.\nBut I guess if I disagree with those, I'm a racist, and if that is the case I'm proud to be one.","replies":[{"poster":"Omni Presents","date":"2015-12-14T07:40:23.039+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"How dare you think to assume the white supremacy race is better, we don't assume, we are!\n\nAnd on another note, why on earth would anyone think the average Australian is not racist? We are terrible down here, and not just the whites, but there are areas where the Aboriginals are racist, there are blacks in West Melbourne who are racist to the whites, the list goes on, but much better than some parts of the world.\n\nBut I do agree with you, once you learn the meaning of racism all of us are racist in some way, can that can be viewed as a good thing in the right context.","replies":[{"poster":"Order 66","date":"2015-12-14T09:42:46.579+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"To be completely honest, if anyone spent enough time with me, they would figure out that I am very 'politically incorrect'.
