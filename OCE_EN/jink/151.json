Yes gj making a perfectly (solo queue) viable champion broken beyond the imagination. Usually I think riot does a decent job of balancing but this new 'juggernaut' thing...not a fan.","replies":[{"poster":"Holland","date":"2015-08-21T12:09:03.286+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Ikr he is so broken and sooo bloody hard to kill he has damage without any damage items he just built tank items. I just played against a Skarner and he went 21/3 couldn't even kill him he litterly went 1v3 and killed everyone.","replies":[{"poster":"Jink","date":"2015-08-21T12:16:39.565+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"It's just too hard to capture his nodes.\n\nLike him not being able to capture them for 15 seconds means nothing because he's still just as dangerous when you're contesting stuff because of ulti and his map wide presence is insane.\n\nHe's insanely difficult to punish and strong at all stages of the game.\n\nHe's hard to duel, his ganks are strong, he gains automatic node control and to top it all off his stun mechanic is a bit strong because he is easily capable of nabbing some CDR, coupled with how fast his jungle clears are about all that beats him is a strong CC comp where people can follow up his engages but those kind of teams aren't good at controlling nodes so I think he might be nerfed aye.","replies":[]}]}]}]}
