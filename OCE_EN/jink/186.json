Like I E'd and right clicked and was 3/4 of the way through and then she E'd - but like is it because hers is on target and mine isn't or something? Because the animation of knocking her back had applied before she was close - it's just weird that her knockback cancels mine so I was wondering what the mechanic was, because she had the E applied to her and her E is really the same, where each applies a knockback but mine was in animation and application before hers (he was doing the charge then she E'd - so does E'ing later counteract or something?).","replies":[{"poster":"Riot Koalifier","date":"2015-12-09T18:24:55.772+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yeah I think it definitely has to do with the animation timing.

I devastating charged her and it was animating and she heroic charged me and she knocked me back instead of the other way around. Her W was on cooldown (The aoe that stops dashes) we just both charged each other, her with her dash knockback and the tiny little Yorlde outdoes my giant pony knockback on my E as I dash in and knock them back and apply damage.","replies":[{"poster":"Riot Koalifier","date":"2015-12-09T18:23:43.169+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Ohhhhhh that makes a lot more sense. Yeah in that scenario her E should \"win\" over your E. Basically, her E knocks you back before you can knock her back, I think due to the long animation/knockback timing of Hec's E. As far as I know, Hec E basically loses most knockback fights with dashes (like vs. Sejuani, Vi, now Poppy). It just feels weird because Poppy's E is targeted as opposed to a skillshot.\n\nMy guess is that this is working as intended, and just an unfortunate result for Hecarim :(","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Lord Sesshomaru","date":"2015-12-09T01:03:07.838+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"i think he means they both dashed at eachother, and her dash knocked him back ignoring his dash.\n\nso unless she had W active at the time (which is entirely possible) its just the E he means.. i think.","replies":[{"poster":"Jink","date":"2015-12-09T01:26:48.309+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Lord Sesshomaru,realm=OCE,application-id=Ntey9fRZ,discussion-id=3eMnGx4G,comment-id=00020000,timestamp=2015-12-09T01:03:07.838+0000)\n>\n> i think he means they both dashed at eachother, and her dash knocked him back ignoring his dash.\n> \n> so unless she had W active at the time (which is entirely possible) its just the E he means.. i think.\n\nYeah lol why does her E outdo my E.

(Attacking the target applies his E too so if you have attack clicked them then hit E it knocks them back like straight away which can be useful but you miss out on the skills damage boost for how far you travelled during it being active).","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Project Xayah","date":"2015-12-09T00:58:37.977+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It probably depends on who uses theirs first.

I think the other person was right though, if my knockback is going to knock her back further and she casts hers a little late, her's over-rides because it's going to knock me back a shorter distance so it's a sort of \"first in worst dressed\" mechanic.
