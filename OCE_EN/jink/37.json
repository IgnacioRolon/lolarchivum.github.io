Used to play on a crappy comp so ended up in bronze 5... as soon as I got a new comp it was pretty easy to climb, I just mainly played Champions I played a lot and it's pretty easy. It's sorta hard to climb outta gold atm because I tend to play for fun a lot more and mix up my picks which isn't the best but I get bored of maining Champions...\n\nThe hardest part about climbing is when you're forced into less favourite champs to counter teams or go with your own team lol but if you make sure you are countering or picking into your teams Champions or making safe 1st picks or early picks etc the game can be a lot easier.","replies":[{"poster":"Talon12","date":"2015-12-20T06:36:50.236+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"big head. i did same thing (but better) dont see me bragging","replies":[{"poster":"Jink","date":"2015-12-20T11:47:05.188+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Talon12,realm=OCE,application-id=Ntey9fRZ,discussion-id=oLIEhA0z,comment-id=000100000000,timestamp=2015-12-20T06:36:50.236+0000)\n>\n> big head. i did same thing (but better) dont see me bragging\n\nBut u just did.\n\nAlso don't necro my threads, it's embarrassing.
