I mean realistically trying to even out that amount of combinations to become more skill related seems like a joke to me and I honestly think you shouldn&#039;t bother and I think it&#039;s unfair that you&#039;re nerfing Champions because honestly it mostly seems to be based on people whinging and I&#039;m sick of the nerfs to certain Champions while others that are incredibly annoying 9 times out of ten are getting buffs.\n\nI mean I&#039;d jump on the whinging bandwagon and point fingers and name names excessively but there&#039;s no point although I have a few example. The nerfs you implement are either non-impacting or hugely impact the Champion and then just worsen certain matchups and people don&#039;t bother whinging even though a Champion that was already a 6/10 in levels of power is now 8/10 because your Champion got nerfed and is now less safe to pick against that Champion possibly being taken or because that Champion is taken so you just move on and main someone else until the sequential buffs to Champions that counter that one that is now an 8/10 against yours are increased enough that it becomes apparent the 8/10 needs a nerf because Riot employees are getting smashed by the 8/10 Champion so they nerf that Champion then people just move back to the one that wasn&#039;t safe to pick anymore but is now then smash everyone because the Champ is fun to play and then the cycle repeats, Champions that counter that one get buffed or that Champ gets nerfed and then people move on until everyone else is nerfed into the ground and that Champion becomes playable again or is indirectly buffed or a few 7/10 Champions get nerfed and it&#039;s relatively safe to take that Champion or they become a safer early pick and you can just play safe and let your team help counter by counter-picking and smashing the 8/10 in team fights.\n\nSkill plays a very minor role in the game and you&#039;d know this if you played certain matchups - and these matchups are the reason a lot of Champions aren&#039;t played very often because ending up in certain matchups is a waste of a game so you may as well just pick safe Champions and the problem is people whinge when they lose to a Champion that becomes strong and is effective yet don&#039;t whinge when they get in a bad matchup they can do nothing about - because there&#039;s no point; Riot loves the competitive scene too much and the Competitive scene main 2 or 3 different Champions and do nothing Original and stick to a Meta 9 times out of 10, breaking it once in a blue moon and when they do break it; it&#039;s not playing an underpowered Champion: It&#039;s an OP one -in certain matchups- and the Champion cops a nerf (Like AP Yi) when it&#039;s basically instantly countered and most of the pros that lose to it lose simply because it&#039;s a Champ that can be in one of 3 or even 4 lanes and they didn&#039;t counter-pick because it was a first pick and then their whole team gets dunked on and they cry to Riot for nerfs by spamming how strong the Champion/style is but Champions that are actually overpowered from the get go, frustrating or matchups that are literally nothing to do with skill (Poppy vs Teemo) are ignored entirely and no item in the world will help you deal with a Teemo as Poppy but we better nerf Yi because he dunked a few proffessionals.\n\nThis is the worst logic because there are sooooooooooo many ways people can instantly shut down or dunk on an AP Yi but there is literally nothing a Poppy can do to a Teemo yet because people did good with it in pro matches you deleted it yet you don&#039;t delete Teemo.\n\nI don&#039;t understand.\n\nIf I'm Poppy vs Teemo - I can't do anything. If we both have a CC Gap closer jungler - yaya I landed a skill on him and he just auto'd my Jungler 3 times and now he's going b. Awesome.\n\nLost during Champ select. I lose during Champ select 3 games out of 10 and roughly 5 games are skill matchups and 2 are snowball competitions in bot and top.\n\nNerfing Champions did nothing to change this averaged statistic. All you did was remove fun things.\n\nAP Yi outskilled people.\n\nTeemos just a lane bully like Lucian.\n\nIf you counterpicked Yi he became less useful than a Poppy with 0 farm and 1 item so why remove it almost entirely?","replies":[{"poster":"Klavinmour","date":"2015-06-25T20:17:09.414+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"You obviously never played, or played against AP Yi. It had no reason to exist, other than to be completely broken.\nYou ask anyone who has played when AP Yi was a thing, they'll tell you it's just like Pre-Rework Karma, it literally ruined the game.\n\nIf you ever paid much attention to the pro matches you'll noticed when it comes to picking champs it's a combination of rock/paper/scissors and individual skill with the champs.\nSomeone good on Rock might be counter picked by someone playing Paper, but the person who picked Rock now has a team mate that picked Scissors.\n\nBut then skill also comes into play here.\nSometimes when you see someone pick an \"off-meta\" champion in the pro scene it's either because they know that champion can beat what is current \"in-meta\" and they've had some practice with it, or they've had some practice with the champ and they want to throw the enemy team through the loop with a pick that is neither strong or weak against the opponent's pick.\n\nNow here is a non-pro example for you. The other day I was trying out Ekko, had played a few matches trying him out, found I love his kit, hate the champ and his personality.\nNow I eventually ended up in a match facing off against a LeBlanc. I sat back and went \"Okay, this is going to be tough, Ekko is weak against LeBlanc, but it's okay I mained LeBlanc back on EUW I know her in an out, and she's just had a nerf\".\nI had a horrible laning phase against her. I quickly realised my opponent has played less LeBlanc than me, and had studied SivHD's moves and was trying to use some.\nDespite having a terrible laning phase, and my champ being weak against the enemy champ, not once did I die to LeBlanc, infact I scored two kills against her in that match.\nHere is the match in question http://matchhistory.oce.leagueoflegends.com/en/#match-details/OC1/94203564/34224016?tab=overview\nUnfortunately still lost (no thanks to the intentionally feeding Kennen) but I had fun coming against a champion my champion was weak against, and while not coming out on top, somewhat coming even before totally losing.\n\nWhy do Riot only \"balance\" the popular champs, because there is enough data on them to do so.\nIt's like how people say Riot intentionally make new champs overpowered on release so people buy them for FreELO.\n1) Champs are free, you'll find yourself at a point where you have 100,000 IP and nothing but new champions to spend it on.\n2) The PBE is too small to actually offer any real amount of usable data in terms of balancing a champion, only when a champion is on the Live client and popular will Riot know where the issues lie and be able to work on them. Ryze is a good current example of this, and you can hear that talked about in the latest Patch Rundown https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=feCeOcI8GZ0","replies":[{"poster":"Jink","date":"2015-06-27T11:06:14.828+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Ryze was pretty brokenly OP.\n\nI understand where you're coming from but Turrets offer a lot of Gold to the enemy team and a Teemo with map control is a nightmare and I find that even with the whole rock paper scissors thing, if we don't have a lot of late-game strength I need to be at least able to last hit 1 minion in a wave yet will get abused to hell for even trying and theres literally - chance of doing anything in this matchup of poppy vs Teemo and while I understand the concept of ganks it's just sad that there is literally nothing you can do in this specific matchup but sit back and not get a minion which kind of reminds me of a pro match I watched where the pro player Jax basically just sat there dancing as Darius farmed and then late-game wrecked their entire team and to me this kind of thing needs looking at because it happens occasionally (terribad matchups) and it makes for a bad game - this never used to happen because the starting items were better and there were more good options and more options full stop and now Riot has created a \"level 1 GG\" meta wherein pro players are forced to gank which makes for cool spectating but when you're in that situation and not all 5 of you are skyped (duo/solo queue is a majority of Leagues players) you can't really co-ordinate this - let alon co-ordinate a lane swap and it basically sucks.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Azirious Mistake","date":"2015-06-26T00:08:41.381+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Riot defines counterplay as \"What can you do when the enemy's x champ is played to their fullest potential?\" \n\neg. A perfectly played Poppy will eventually outscale a Teemo, and a perfectly played Poppy will freeze the lane to their turret and the enemy Teemo will place himself in danger of a jungle gank if he plays wrong, so the Teemo is forced into overextending in order to gain xp from minion kills, and an overextended Teemo is what is known as \"gank bait\". All the Poppy needs is a Spectres Cowl and a Trinity Force to start taking control of the matchup, then Teemo is forced to play passively, because one mistake and Poppy will make said Teemo's life a living hell.\n\nNew champions generally have very clear counterplay in their kits, one example is Rek'sai, Rek'sai has extreme mobility and map pressure, but her map pressure is negated if her tunnels are located and destroyed, also her one escape mechanic has to be used offensively as an engage, so in a skirmish she is no more mobile than a Teemo, in fact, even Teemo is better at creating distance than her until about 8 seconds of fighting (When Rek'Sai's tunnel opens up and she can retreat) and even then her one chance of escape can be stood on and destroyed. Additionally, outside from Chilling Smite, Rek'sai has no sticking power and has a very low vision range, so she is prone to getting kited, so a well played Rek'sai will have to be opportunistic at picking a time to go in, also taking into account enemy CC.\n\nAP Yi when played to his fullest potential offered no counterplay. Don't hold me to this though, I was relatively new when AP yi was a craze but I have a rough understanding on what makes him good. His Q-lich bane combo did tons of damage and full build was enough to one-shot a squishy, and on top of that, highlander reset all his ability cooldowns so he could do that same combo again, dealing another 1000 aoe damage, lather rinse and repeat for penta, and even if it didn't he could then meditate and become literally unkillable with the bonus 250 armour and magic resist and the heavily scaling heal and by the time meditate finished his Alpha Strike would be up again.\n\nI appreciate the effort you made into posting this but this is pretty heavily biased.","replies":[{"poster":"Jink","date":"2015-06-27T12:11:51.781+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"He could heal for like 2K with ease, however because his Q puts him in range he was easily countered by Champions like Malzahar - Riot (And I) just don't like Champions that require specific counters mainly because he could be taken into the Jungle as AD or even played as AD top or AD mid instead (different style and counters) to bait out counterpicks then shut down the counter - with nothing you could do about it and also because hands down he was strong but Riot gutted him rather than leave it as a style - yet there are still heaps of OP Champions right now but Riot doesn't even take a second glance when these Champions wreck 90% of their matchups because they're not penta based.\n\nThat logic.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"LUPIN lll","date":"2015-06-26T02:43:47.222+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Fucking.
