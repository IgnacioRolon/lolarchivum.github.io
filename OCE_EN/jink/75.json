His whole life story revolves around walking into lane and stacking Q.\r\n\r\nHe does nothing.\r\n\r\nJust tries to stack Q.\r\n\r\nDunk on him early and he does nothing.\r\n\r\nNot only is he boring to lane against, because even once you&#039;ve won lane you just have to show up to lane again to stop him from being useful, but even when he is useless he just shows up to lane again.\r\n\r\nHe doesn&#039;t do anything for the team, but go top and try to farm some more.\r\n\r\nIt&#039;s sad. I actually feel sorry for Nasus players, watching their little brains work while I sit top and deny them any chance at life - so not only are they boring to verse because you can&#039;t actually do anything but sit top against him, he&#039;s trash because he will refuse to even try and do anything but hope he can sneak a few more Q stacks once he&#039;s been rendered useless.\r\n\r\nDouble kill - on making a sh*t Champion.\r\n\r\nHe&#039;s boring to verse and then he bores you some more because once the &quot;versing&quot; is over he actually has the gall to sit top and look like he&#039;s a Champion that contributes anything to the League or does anything but attempt to be a carry - while having absolutely no chance unless you are bored to tears at him and want to actually do something in the game, besides oppress an opponent after abusing them.","replies":[{"poster":"Fruitlewp","date":"2015-05-18T05:42:21.759+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Another rant?
