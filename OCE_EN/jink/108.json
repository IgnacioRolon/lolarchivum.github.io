All the ADC has to do is wait for the support to CC and bam kill.\n\nIdeally **both teams have supports**. If your support is shit at helping control dragon then too bad. \nI'm pretty sure the jungler is idealistically the player that should control dragon. Are you going to say junglers are the bane of League because they control dragon far more effectively than any other role?\n\nI wouldn't see any difference if your same logic was applied to any other role.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Ghazan","date":"2015-05-04T18:46:28.873+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"both teams have a support so theres an equal chance of u getting a good one or bad one and so for the other team. chances are u made this post after the enemy had a good support and their team beat yours while your support was bad","replies":[]}]}
