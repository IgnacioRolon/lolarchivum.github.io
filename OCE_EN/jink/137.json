He can actually run down Hecarim with Righteous glory which is basically what makes him stupidly strong because if he fails his engage with it you can&#039;t actually counter engage because of the massive AOE slow so he gets to fail his engages and not actually be punished for it.\r\n\r\nHe has a stupidly safe harass free lane phase and you can&#039;t actually farm because if you stop for a spit second to auto he can grab you with ease and you can&#039;t actually harass him or the enemy carry because you need to sit behind minions. Without a strong engage he&#039;s impossible to deal with and even with a strong engage and lockdown he&#039;s still a better engager and counter-engager.\r\n\r\nHands down needed a nerf from the start, not a buff. Play against a good blitzcrank and tell me otherwise.","replies":[{"poster":"Niji","date":"2015-06-12T23:42:32.100+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Is this thread a joke?","replies":[]},{"poster":"ESP Azamalaza","date":"2015-06-12T14:15:43.145+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"\" he has the strongest engage in the game \"\n\nhi, umm my friend that title would go to someone like leona or malphite, sej, amumu... glad i could help - ur welcome","replies":[{"poster":"Jink","date":"2015-06-12T17:12:11.134+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yeah but they actually make themselves vulnerable, blitz just drags you into a 1v5.\n\nHonestly which is worse, being blitz grabbed or being malph ulted?\n\nYou could say it's the same but Malphs ult forces you to flash or whatever because it allows them to engage yet at the very least you can counter engage without the whole team having to flash in and/or have gap closers to turn that 1v5 into a 5v5 and even then they are at the disadvantage of having used flashes or simply because even if they do flash and gap close in; whoever got grabbed has basically just eaten 5 rotations of spells and is now unlikely to be able to fight for long if they are not dead within 2 seconds so it's basically going to be a 4v5 shortly after the fantastical scenario of an entire team flashing or gap closing to counter engage.\n\nYou can say Malph ult counters someone being grabbed too but then he's missing out on hitting their backline and is basically just making it a 2v5 instead which is honourable but isn't really going to change the outcome much.","replies":[{"poster":"ESP Azamalaza","date":"2015-06-12T22:16:58.767+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"hi, and blitz doesnt make himself vunerable pulling an enemy straight to him? so many times have i seen blitz pull someone like morgana, leona, alistar and end up screwing himself over and blitz grab is waaaay easier to dodge than malph ult","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"kJs","date":"2015-06-12T17:54:28.839+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"*wicked fast*\n*wicked fast*\n*wicked fast*\n*wicked fast*\n*wicked fast*\n*wicked fast*\n*wicked fast*","replies":[{"poster":"Jink","date":"2015-06-12T19:46:10.724+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Rocket Grab : RANGE: 925; Projectile speed: 1800\n\nMystic Shot : RANGE: 1150; Projectile Speed: 2000\n\nOnly difference being Mystic shot isn't instantly a 1v5.\n\nShouldn't have to flash just because he cast a 20 second CD 100 mana skill when with 40% CDR it's 12 seconds and heaps of his items give mana which synergize hugely with his kit and shield and 100 mana becomes nothing to him and he doesn't really use his mana elsewhere at all and gets % Mana regen from Support tree so he can just grab at people every 12 seconds and as soon as he shows up to lane with a few items you are forced to play passive for the entire time he's there, likewise in mid.\n\nRiot is against passive play and you can't actually go aggressive on him in most cases at all and he gets away with playing super aggressive around early-mid to mid game and can even take pot shots early with just a few mana potions and you're forced to sit back for the whole game basically.","replies":[]}]}]}
