Not a warning system. I shouldn't have to put in an effort to report these people and if I do it should be checked on and be an instant ban. If I am upset, I wont report someone because I'd rather continue on and do something else other than dwell on their scumbag name while I report them. It's a life skill. Learn it.

It gets reports, checks the chat logs of the game in question and, if the person who was reported use abusive/offensive language, it punishes them. In fact, in the first few days, there were 3 people who came to complain on the boards about it, claiming they didn't abuse/did \"minimal\" abuse and got punished at which point Sephyre came round and talked about how they were abusive in the games, offering to go through the chat logs with them if they were willing to post them and, big surprise, not one of them took up that offer.\n\nIf you don't believe me, here's the links:\nhttp://boards.oce.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/miscellaneous/AsuHrKhn-bans-are-to-harsh?comment=0006\nhttp://boards.oce.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/help-support-oce/QiQGxn3l-suspensions-and-banning?comment=0002\nhttp://boards.oce.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/miscellaneous/Mtbk5OpB-the-double-standards-set-by-riot-are-a-joke?comment=0007","replies":[{"poster":"DragonOfTheVoid","date":"2015-07-12T21:58:24.449+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"look at the end of the day the world is just like this if your sugar cup baby filings cant handle it  then goo away and do wot you sed you gona do last knight littil baby","replies":[{"poster":"Project Xayah","date":"2015-07-13T06:47:27.538+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"It's not about people not being able to handle it though, it's that people shouldn't *have* to put up with it.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Jink","date":"2015-07-13T20:12:50.238+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"http://apollo-uploads-oce.s3.amazonaws.com/1436818375/cool-thanks-guy-thumb.jpg","replies":[]},{"poster":"DragonOfTheVoid","date":"2015-07-12T21:57:25.756+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=snakeowen,realm=OCE,application-id=Ntey9fRZ,discussion-id=2FymhUbq,comment-id=000200000000000000000000000000000000,timestamp=2015-07-12T21:58:24.449+0000)\n>\n> look at the end of the day the world is just like this if your sugar cup baby filings cant handle it  then goo away and do wot you sed you gona do last knight littil baby\n\nnow good day this is the last time any one will come to jour sad littlie site","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"GoldenTomat0","date":"2015-07-13T01:08:03.458+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=snakeowen,realm=OCE,application-id=Ntey9fRZ,discussion-id=2FymhUbq,comment-id=0002000000000000000000000000,timestamp=2015-07-12T13:44:45.601+0000)\n> they cant just ban people with out the prof\n\nyes they can.\nread the TOU.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"GoldenTomat0","date":"2015-07-11T20:17:13.841+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"so because someone was mean to you online and hurt your special snow flake feelings, they should be instantly banned?\ngrow the fuck up.","replies":[{"poster":"Jink","date":"2015-07-12T05:08:34.735+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You're telling me to grow up?
