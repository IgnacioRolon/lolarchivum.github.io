The purpose of why there are two tabs is so that the first tab that shows the champion splash art, and the skills, is to represent just a small amount of information so that players can understand what the champion does and how it is affected.\n\nAlso I do not think riot would do something to change it so that we can see the action of the ability in just the first tab. The action preview is only just a click away to see what it does, although I would like to see the scaling information on the ability icons in the first tab. Maybe even in the abilities tab.","replies":[{"poster":"Jink","date":"2015-05-05T15:54:33.739+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yeah adding the scaling abilities would be cool. You used to be able to mouse-over in Champion view to see what the ability did and they removed it. No idea why, now it just takes longer because you have to go to the abilities tab.","replies":[]}]}]}
