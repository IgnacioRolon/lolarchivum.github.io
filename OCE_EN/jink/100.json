When it dragged him he didn&#039;t even come close to the wall so not sure if it was a bug on Poppy&#039;s side or Zeds.","replies":[{"poster":"GigaPube","date":"2015-10-28T16:21:12.816+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"the weirdest thing about this is, you played poppy? lol jk gj m8","replies":[{"poster":"Jink","date":"2015-10-28T17:37:43.346+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Lol.\n\nYeah. Ended up mid too because Riv stole my lane but I went like 16-8-14 or something.\n\nCarry dies instantly. {{item:3153}} {{item:3078}} {{item:3046}} {{item:3031}} {{item:1324}}.\n\nWas working on {{item:3146}}\n\nI'd go {{item:3072}} but her Q every 4 seconds converts her attack into magic damage and I feel that Vamping 20% off a 1200 damage Q exceeds missing out on vamping off it at all with a BT just for 10% more lifesteal on 350-800 damage autos and think missing out on that 20% of the 1200 or so damage Q's is less useful and feel like I kite things out to some extent and fight more with cooldowns than just autos so it suits my playstyle of re-engaging with Q etc and in doing so vamp off it and find it better than being able to lifesteal a bit more in the autos between Q's.\n\nPoppy's just low play rate for me because she suffers mana problems in top and poke mages are hard to verse in mid. Seen good poppy Junglers with heal smite tho lol. She has good trading mechanisms top but they're very expensive mana-wise and in mid lane your damage is better and mana is less of a problem but you get outranged heavily with no way of trading and its hard to all in them and your W is armor so you benefit less from it.","replies":[{"poster":"GigaPube","date":"2015-10-28T18:41:32.421+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"yeah i cant stand mana problems. if i went that build id have gone essence reaver over bt","replies":[]}]}]}]}
