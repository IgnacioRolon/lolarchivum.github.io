There are tonnes of champs that dominate in 1v1. Hell any champ can dominate in a 1v1 depending on each players skill. This is a pretty poor complaint since I have used Shyvana myself and due to my skill I can only sometimes 1v1 a player. There was a time though where I was just on a massive roll with her and dominated in the game. It all depends on the player but she is by no means to OP, she can of course be OP and when used with a skilled player on a decent team she can come across as a to OP character. But again there are so so so so many other champs way more OP than her it's just silly to call her out, plus if she was as OP as you say she would get used a lot, but in all the games I have played I have only seen her used a few times. She is a good champ but like I said there are way more champs who do way more damage and way more champs who can own in a 1v1.","replies":[]}]}]}]}
