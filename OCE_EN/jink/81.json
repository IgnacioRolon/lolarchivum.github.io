(I should know the order by now I know but I still double check) [ I know being able to upgrade faster isn&#039;t hugely important it just feels better to be in lane faster]\r\n\r\nAlso in Item sets it doesn&#039;t show you the stats of the Runeglaive enchant (I was just going to double check to see whether its a worthy buy on Jungle Akali but it doesn&#039;t show the stats of what damage it deals in aoe, only the Jungler gold bonus and regen effect.)\r\n\r\nAlso, do you think we&#039;ll ever see Energy items? I understand they&#039;d probably be hard to balance but is there any chance we&#039;d ever have Champion specific itemization for Energy Champions IE in the jungle or otherwise or would it be a consistent nightmare to balance?\r\nI&#039;ve used Energy Runes before and found them rewarding for certain playstyles and builds but find I miss out on a lot of stats taking them and they&#039;re a bit hit or miss and because I use such a big variety of runes it isn&#039;t really an option for me to play all the Champions I do if I have a multitude of pages dedicated to having energy runes for specific match-ups (The builds I go with them are very specific to matchups and I&#039;d need a lot of pages with different setups and that&#039;d be purely for Akali and wouldn&#039;t translate to other Champions so its a big investment - rune page wise.\r\n\r\nDo you also think we&#039;ll ever receive an addition to the number of rune pages we can have? I think it would be awesome but I don&#039;t know what Riot&#039;s stance is on this.","replies":[{"poster":"Crowd Pleasa","date":"2015-07-04T16:37:12.594+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"The pictures for each jungle enchantment are all different, the colour of the gem changes.
