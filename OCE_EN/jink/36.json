I mean where is the trade off lol. No one has played Skarner in ranked more than once since 2 weeks after his release - probably because of the nerfs (This is in Gold though) and Darius is still a 100% requested ban and a popular and very strong Champion.\n\nLike Mordekaiser has trouble sticking to people but has some crazy damage but has a huge trade-off in that he can&#039;t stick to people, Garen has to trade off having decent CC and Darius just gets the best of everything, plus his synergy with Cleaver applying from his bleeds so he is like an AOE death zone for everyone and splits everyone 100%, Dead man&#039;s gives him everything he needs, Titanic Hydra makes him a joke and while his DPS can scale off after this - because of his innate tackiness with later itemisation and his heals on Q&#039;s his whole kit makes him a complete nightmare to deal with lmao.\n\nI understand his weaknesses but holy crap he is waaaaaaaaaaaay over powered in a lot of scenarios.\n\n{{item:1324}} {{item:3071}} {{item:3742}} {{item:3143}} {{item:3065}}","replies":[{"poster":"Talon12","date":"2015-10-03T08:52:03.957+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thus the power of 3 sec 150% ad heal scale and 350% ad true damage and the power of free 200 or whatever ad on passive was revealed","replies":[]},{"poster":"Klavinmour","date":"2015-10-01T17:40:45.526+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Have you seen Susan with 700 stacks and {{item:3053}} {{item:3742}} {{item:3078}} ???","replies":[{"poster":"Shyvana Bot","date":"2015-10-01T22:22:30.558+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"but susan needs work to get that far.
