I would greatly appreciate if such a mechanic weren't also used on a Champion with such low attack speed - overall, it sucks in big fights and this is where Akali needs to be quick and have found her mid-late game fails because of it and rather than simply not being FOTM Assassin, she has been buried 9 feet deep and Zed continues to dominate, with very few counters other than huge poke teams and simply taking other similarly OP Champions to counter him.","replies":[{"poster":"sparklefart","date":"2015-03-17T22:24:12.463+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"But when you auto attack and get that Q proc along with lich bane...","replies":[]},{"poster":"Lauricella3","date":"2015-03-17T10:41:55.166+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I agree there was no reason how have akali's e not proc q, it is now nearly impossible to proc is pre 6 without cc from another champ.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Sackboy","date":"2015-03-17T10:00:54.878+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I know the thread is sarcasm, but I agree, she needs buffs.","replies":[{"poster":"Jink","date":"2015-03-17T10:44:18.675+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"She doesn't need buffs man it's a true story, I'd be happy with a nerf but this mechanic reverted because it ruined my oversight during team-fights and doesn't do much about her in-lane and whilst Riot argues otherwise it was intended as a nerf and to open up counterplay.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"GoldenTomat0","date":"2015-03-17T10:08:43.487+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"so revert the e nerf. ezpz.","replies":[]}]}
