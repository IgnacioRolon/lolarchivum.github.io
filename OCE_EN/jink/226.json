It pops during fights with other bruisers (5 seconds is perfect timing) and basically makes you win that trade in a way far superior to Randuins minor defensive stats in comparison.","replies":[{"poster":"JasonWazza","date":"2015-08-21T03:03:18.203+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"This is assuming the enemy team has any burst damage whatsoever, let alone that the burst will be directed at you.\n\nConsidering the major point of the Randuin's change (Crit damage reduction) it's likely we will see a removal of Crit heavy ADC's, meaning BotRK and AS over damage.\n\nThis coupled with the fact that AD bruisers recieve a half decent buff (more expensive armor) and AP casters have a nerf (Cheaper MR) mean's that we are probably also going to see Utility mage Mid laners come into the meta (less burst again)\n\nAnd those tanks are dealing sustained damage.\n\nSo how are you planning on taking this damage exactly?","replies":[{"poster":"Jink","date":"2015-08-21T03:12:38.922+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It's usually not worth taking the Crit reduction mastery over the AOE reduction mastery, excepting a game where they have a Vayne, Trynd and Yi - where it is likely you will take crits (even though Yi and Vayne are bad examples) as is, let alone have Randuin's dedicated to it. In a balanced 5v5 team comp, Sterak's will still pop if you plan on a 2v1 engage or plan on engaging with one of these Champs that can hit 2.5-3K HP (Bruisers/Assassins played this way).\n\nIt absolutely craps on randuins and is easy to make use of and will still pop in a lot of 1v1's late game.","replies":[{"poster":"JasonWazza","date":"2015-08-21T03:24:46.769+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"a) better examples for Crit include: Draven, Jinx, Ashe and Quinn for ADC.\n\nb) The reason to not take the mastery has a completely different reason behind it (the fact is your less likely to be taking crit in lane/in general over AoE damage), Randuin's in the current state is a 1 item kick in the pants against ADC's that build Crit, while letting the rest of your build be fluid.\n\nc) i feel your really overselling the item, The stat's given are mediocre the build is honestly trash (that 1190 gold upgrade cost.) and it's only really gold efficient if your procing the Passive nearly every fight (which would say more about your opponent's then the item.) and honestly there are better alternatives, your best reason to buy it is if your being camped and dived repetitively, and in that case buy wards and play smarter/safer.","replies":[]}]}]}]}
