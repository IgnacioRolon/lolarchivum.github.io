{"poster":"Jink","date":"2015-05-17T09:15:02.241+0000","title":"I'm too scared to point out that your build is sh*t.","subforum":"Miscellaneous","up_votes":1,"down_votes":4,"body":"Or that you made a stupid choice.\r\n\r\nMight hurt your feelings and get a report.\r\n\r\n&quot;He said my build was sh*t&quot;\r\n&quot;He said I made a bad choice&quot;.\r\n\r\nBant.\r\n\r\nThe internet is anonymous: why should you be banned for verbal abuse without any possibility of repercussions?\r\n\r\nIt&#039;s not like it can amount to real life violence.\r\n\r\nOh wait, it can - but because the people doing it are anonymous; obviously these people who snap at others would do it anyway: just a matter of time, right?\r\n\r\nWrong.\r\n\r\nBeing abused anonymously fuels more potent aggression than normal confrontations: but with no one to react to: there&#039;s nothing you can do but shut up.\r\n\r\nThere is literally no way you can use online abuse as an excuse for your violence in the real world: so how does what is said on the internet matter?\r\n\r\nI mean really?\r\n\r\nI&#039;m fully in support of a no tolerance policy: yet I don&#039;t understand it: everyone is entitled to their own opinion and if you aren&#039;t smart enough to know when someones wrong: you&#039;re stupid and if it isn&#039;t inherently within your intuition that people talk sh*t: you should learn the hard way through self-questioning after copping abuse repeatedly as there is no other way you will become smart.\r\n\r\nI know this might seem drastic: but this is literally how things would be, if the world weren&#039;t biased towards shutting down abuse forever.\r\n\r\nSo please help this Riot by continuing your greatness at dealing with noobs/feeders/leavers/afkers/trash-talkers and trolls but don&#039;t forget the subtle and sly trolling like when people say &quot;WTF&quot; after you have made a mistake and died, because arguably they may simply be questioning your decision: yet this is a criticism and we can&#039;t have criticisms because they are dwelling on the past in what is most likely a sarcastic way: for example, if they say &quot;WTF&quot; and are criticising the fact you died, perhaps because you got Morgana Snared: they are basically saying &quot;Don&#039;t do that again&quot;.\r\n\r\nYeah no sh*t. I&#039;m a retard.\r\n\r\nThanks.\r\n\r\n100% of games have people that do this, whether it be through pings, attitudes during talking or direct comments and it is all a form of discussion, attitude or expression with underlying negativity: sub-radar toxicity - and the sad part is, it will never be dealt with because that person can simply argue that they did not know you were legitimately aware you made a mistake after you made it and were simply making conversation about the fact you made a mistake: because this is useful as it can offer them a chance to offer advice: for example: &quot;Don&#039;t get morg snared&quot;.\r\n\r\nYeah no sh*t.\r\n\r\nBan these trolls please.\r\n\r\n100% of the community.\r\n\r\nLiterally everyone does it. What you gonna do? Come at me.\r\n\r\nI&#039;m better at this than you, there are 15 year olds that can trigger nerves beyond levels you could even comprehend, within just moments.\r\n\r\nThey know they&#039;re doing it. People know they&#039;re making call-outs on people in the game. Everyone knows when someone refers to a mistake made by you, pings you like you&#039;re a retard or spams the f*ck out of you with pings etc and/or sees you make a mistake they&#039;re making judgements: so why does saying it matter?\r\n\r\nPeople might not say you&#039;re a retard, but they&#039;ll still think it and sheltering people from reality is just saying it doesn&#039;t matter.\r\n\r\nI say let the abuse flow, because it&#039;s unlikely to equate to real harm - unless people are affected by anonymous hatred in which case they&#039;re stupid for caring what bad people have to say and I&#039;d be happy to see them gone.\r\n\r\nCall me evil for saying it, but I think sheltering the world from a sandbox environment is more likely to equate to a human race filled with naivety and dimwittedness than letting people destroy each other in the sandbox world because the only casualties are retards that don&#039;t see a sandbox - as a sandbox. These people are either insane or see the future as consequential and have no proof thus in the sandbox world affecting their future have disproved this consequentialness of their own lives outside the sandbox as the sandbox has taken reign and I say good riddance.\r\n\r\nPeace.","replies":[{"poster":"Olee","date":"2015-05-17T09:25:26.882+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"That was way too long, and did not read it\n\nIf only there was an internet abbreviation for that...","replies":[]},{"poster":"xDarkRavenx","date":"2015-05-17T12:00:49.200+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"TL;DR\n\nYou should write a Fanfiction about Summoners getting bant and ranting about this type of indigestible shit.","replies":[{"poster":"ShuffledPancake","date":"2015-05-17T12:03:29.971+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=xDarkRavenx,realm=OCE,application-id=Ntey9fRZ,discussion-id=z9hPYZfy,comment-id=0004,timestamp=2015-05-17T12:00:49.200+0000)\n>\n> TL;DR\n> \n> You should write a Fanfiction about Summoners getting bant and ranting about this type of indigestible shit.\n\nI would rate that 10/10","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"SEKAI","date":"2015-05-17T15:33:45.064+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"This is the response from me just reading the title.\n\nThere is a difference between using a suboptimal build due to personal preference/playstyles and using a really shiet build that simply doesn't work on this particular champ under the current situation with the mastery/rune he is running.\n\nWhen you wanna criticise, don't be the guy who judges on the former, and provide insights and possible solutions when you're raising some concerns, or at the very least don't go on about it forever.\n\nEDIT: Alright so I now have actually skimmed through your thread, by the end you're sorta talking about how Riot should let people abuse each other in-game with no consequences?
