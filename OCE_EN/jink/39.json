I think it would be great if Bruisers etc had a non-AD item for dealing with HP Stacks and it would be great for versing teams with 2 tanks and a Bruiser if you were the solo tank - to be able to pick up such an item so you can sort of help deal with heavy engages and withdraw back to your back-line to try and help deter opponents from jumping your carries.","replies":[{"poster":"oops","date":"2015-05-29T06:09:58.564+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Bruisers/tanks already deal more damage than they should.","replies":[]},{"poster":"JasonWazza","date":"2015-05-28T18:07:23.526+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yes let's put more %HP items in the game, this seems like a good idea.\n\nExcept for the fact that people won't use it as only a tank item.","replies":[{"poster":"Jink","date":"2015-05-28T19:59:58.717+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"A Scaling per level increased % of Current HP Damage item would be balanced and not do significant amounts of damage to AD Carries and AP Carries but would be great against Tanks and semi-effective against Bruisers.","replies":[{"poster":"JasonWazza","date":"2015-05-28T20:22:22.412+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"is BoRK/Liandry's not enough?\n\nWould you rather a marksman meta?\n\nI don't think you understand how % HP damage items work if you honestly want another one.\n\nFact: %HP damage items still work against non tanks, meaning it'll likely become a staple (especially in solo lanes)","replies":[]}]}]}]}
