Lmao\nIn all seriousness (if you are being serious) I've never really thought that before and I play them both.\nLux, Morg, and Nami however all feel so damn similar to me.. Snare ability, Damage Ability and a Shield yourself/ally ability. Their ults are a little more diverse but I guess they all do damage and have pretty good range. They're also all female and supports/mages.\nIf you're gonna call any champs the same I would have gone with them.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Infected Walnut","date":"2015-09-01T12:45:17.061+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Level1Pentakill,realm=OCE,application-id=Ntey9fRZ,discussion-id=ETExbAAV,comment-id=,timestamp=2015-09-01T12:13:49.514+0000)\n>\n> Jinx gets move speed on kill or assist, Tristana just jumps the same distance on kill or assist as Jinx travels in the same amount of time.\n\nnot if there's a wall in the way\n\n> Jinx fires a CC in a line.
