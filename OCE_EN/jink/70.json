Won both games with a build I found ages ago.\n\n{{summoner:12}} {{summoner:14}} \n\n{{item:1056}} {{item:3241}} {{item:1053}} {{item:3006}} {{item:3086}} {{item:1018}} {{item:1038}} {{item:1037}} {{item:3031}} {{item:1018}} {{item:3046}} {{item:3035}} {{item:3072}} {{item:3022}} \n\nIt&#039;s meant to be better in mid lane but it works bot too.\n\nThe Doran&#039;s Ring and maxing Q then E lets you keep lane from being pushed and sustain a little plus gives a bit of harass - you have 3 dashes so you can basically hyper-position around in team fights and dash over walls and back in for charms and stuff - you can split push and get out rather effectively with your ultimate, Charming an Enemy ADC for 2 seconds is Akin to a 1v1 Varus ult but where they are disabled for the duration of the Charm (2 seconds at max 1 second at 1st rank) and with TP you can effectively Use your dash and quickly port out you are being flanked etc.\n\nI don&#039;t know how it works because it might seem bad to rush zerkers with Vamp and then Zeal with your Doran&#039;s Ring but it lets you wave clear really quickly and effectively and you can basically avoid trading early game. Late game she becomes a monster. She has a really good attack animation that makes last hitting easy and orb-walking easy and you can port in for gank - with 3 dashes on what is essentially an ADC. You can dive, CC for your team, you still have the ignite plus the move speed of PD and your Q movespeed and your CC can be incredibly useful too.\n\nPeople might troll you for it but being able to dash and Charm an ADC and land 3 auto-attacks for like 700 Damage and then get out scott free and even commit or follow up is really strong - her only real weakness is early game which the build sort of covers and if you like taking risks or playing random things you should try it :)","replies":[{"poster":"Monkey D Luffy","date":"2015-10-13T11:49:36.460+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I got a triple with fiddlesticks adc once, doesn't make it good.","replies":[{"poster":"Jink","date":"2015-10-13T12:12:37.561+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I've seen good ADC fiddlesticks lmao.
