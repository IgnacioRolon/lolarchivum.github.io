I highly doubt Irelia would - seeing as his defamation was on Stream so she has no proof really and Riot wouldn't really investigate this - but if I see any Sneaky posts or Vids or Games I am downvoting, ignoring and not watching because that is f-cking sad dude and I f-cking hope C9 loses all their games.\n\nYou're like Challenger reporting another Challenger for saying you didn't do a lot of damage after you've said they suicided or made a stupid choice as if it's not a legitimate statement and have ignored the potential legitimacy of their statement plus Sneaky is basically saying - When he says he's on tilt on his Stream: that he's not focusing; and I'm 100% sure 'Irelia Carries You' probably saw that C9 Sneaky was playing half-assedly too or at least had merit to point that out as his opinion of Sneaky's play and C9 Sneaky chucks in a report.\n\nThat is so disrespectful it's not even funny and such a poor choice to take against someone you have basically defamed on stream - who's simply stating their opinion of your own play after you've chucked out comments and assumptions about theirs as if you have any clue what's going on in their game or as if you are some form of perfect being and always legendary yourself and this is like the most immature thing I've seen in a long time and it's coming from a Pro Player.\n\nIt's just disappointing that people are like this over a Video game and actively Try to get someone banned for having an opinion when they have a pretty f-cking big opinion themselves and through their own words have shown that their opinion of themselves is pretty f-cking high too but they can't take a snide remark about their own actions in game when they've made one themselves and are taking a poke \"purely for the stream viewers to learn\" which is likely to backfire on you if the person in your team is listening unbeknownst and you should just buckle up and stfu if you get caught out using them as a reference of what not to do but he tries weasel hid way out of it and then chucks in a report because Irelia said \"You didn't do much damage this game\".\n\nLow\nAs\nF-ck.\n\n\n*This is as bad as the stereotypical American law suits that take place.*\n\nSneaky should literally be banned from reporting in some form of counter suit because from looking at the above he's basically said f-ck you, is saying f-ck you to him by putting in a report which he says to Irelia over the stream with a snide undertone and is basically trying to get him banned as well for criticizing when he's done it himself and from a legal perspective it's basically defamation countered with defamation and if you swing back after someone tries to defame you; you can't expect the cops not to arrest you too or treat you with the same punishments or whatever - in the real world; and this is the real world - if you swing back you are just as bad - you could have taken the mature route; and even though Sneaky himself instigates it he swings the last blow and from Riots perspective all they'll see is Irelia making a snide remark.\n\n2 Low 2 be Pro.","replies":[{"poster":"Kimochi Senpai","date":"2015-09-16T22:50:13.353+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Majority of the league community is like this.
