Hydra has a good build path, it tries to make use of everything in the AD department. Items like Deathcap have a very hard build path but give a bigger jump in power, saving 1600g is a pain in the ass while saving 1900g while still getting items along the way (pickaxe, longsword, the beads) is much better as it keeps giving you something in turn for the time you're wasting to farm it.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Rav","date":"2015-03-07T13:52:34.039+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"You buy it for sustain, not a power spike.","replies":[]},{"poster":"KingDinger","date":"2015-03-05T14:34:32.100+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"lifesteal is highly valuable. and its main point is the items it builds into.\n\n800g is actually really cost efficient. it could go up to 1.5k and would still be worth it.","replies":[{"poster":"Monkey D Luffy","date":"2015-03-05T15:05:07.672+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Not really, it could go up by 200 and be efficient but that's about it.","replies":[{"poster":"KingDinger","date":"2015-03-05T23:03:00.937+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"the stat of lifesteal is extremely overpowered. and a tier 2 item can be any price. as long as the legendary item remains the same, it doesnt matter how much its parts cost.\n\n1500 is about the highest it can go without impacting the final item cost (cutlass would require some strange changes)","replies":[{"poster":"Jink","date":"2015-03-07T14:05:28.448+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The Cutlass build path is strong (in my opinion) but buying it for Bloodthirster sucks, as come mid-game if you buy a ward or two you often run out of slots and have to save for the total cost of the Bloodthirster (1950) and picking one up earlier is often not an option if you are rushing a big item like B.F Sword with a few dorans, potions and maybe a zeal and ward or 2 - as an AD Carry and as others have said, you don't feel like you are gaining much when buying it for a Hydra (The Hydra recipe is very expensive but effective, but it seems like often Vampiric Sceptre works out to add little for the cost when compared to Pickaxe or even Cloak of Agility.","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Unseen Predator","date":"2015-03-07T14:15:21.881+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The stats used to be separate, it was 400 for Vampiric which had i think 10% life steal and 400 for Long Sword, you could buy these items separately but because Riot had combined the item it now costs 800 which is the reason for the high cost, people used to start Vampiric all the time because it offered a lot, life steal is an expensive stat because of its high impact.\n\nThe stat is worth the price, you are able to build it out of a long sword and it also builds into major items, there was a reason it was nerfed, it offered too much.","replies":[]}]}
