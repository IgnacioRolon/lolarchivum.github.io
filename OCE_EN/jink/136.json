They're legit not recalling in something Riot cannot be bothered wasting their time with because while it is Cheap and nasty, it's nigh on impossible to catch/prove without extensive effort in a report function if it was implemented as \"Against the rules\" so the rest of society will just frown on you for being cheap and nasty and executing so you can undermine the rules through a game function left for scenarios where you do simply die without consqeuencial gold gain to the enemies or aren't doing it so you aren't stuck with low health or needing to buy and go execute to buy and heal then get back to lane with little or no consequence (20 seconds vesus not being able to buy and not being full health and mana) lol ok that's totes not a free recall and something hard to punish and something even harder to bring in a mechanic to stop and something ridiculously open to speculation hence hard to report and something that defeats the purpose of a \"no recall\" rule and is done by cheap people and nasty people.\n\nEvery time I see someone do it, I feel a little sorry for them for being so cheap that they would work around a rule with an extremely difficult to close loophole and look down on them for it.","replies":[{"poster":"Jink","date":"2015-09-20T17:41:56.654+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"They do it to go back to base and buy and it's hard to close this loophole, its done by cheap nasty people and there is no other explanation for why you would do it than to undermine a rule and get back to base to heal and buy through abusing a loophole.","replies":[{"poster":"Unseen Predator","date":"2015-09-20T18:42:17.002+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"This is the worst trolling i have ever seen.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Veryhungryperson","date":"2015-09-20T22:00:55.809+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"While it may indeed be a recall you should consider the situation where someone executes.  Discounting scenarios where one team intentionally allows it too happen.\n\n1. Most commonly the enemy team has been aced and  executing is a punishment for allowing that to happen. The tradeoff here is the enemy team does not take one of your turrets and you gain pressure to take theirs and contrary to popular belief destroying the enemy base is how you win a game of league of legends.\n\n2. Enemy sneaks past your team. Which, I'm assuming, takes considerable skill and is deserving of a reward.
