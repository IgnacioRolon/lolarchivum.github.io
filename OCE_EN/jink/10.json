You can&#039;t poke. You can&#039;t engage, you need like 10 gap closers to get to her then she just rocket jumps out and walks back in, then you need to blow like 5 flashes to get to her and she just flashes out then walks back in.\r\n\r\nJinx is weak right now, she was nerfed when she didn&#039;t need it - now with all this Randuin&#039;s BS - her attack speed being the highest in the game and having synergy with on-hits but her kit not backing it up (no escape/dash) she is heavily Crit orientated plus her rockets can splash Crits and she got nerfed then you added Randuin&#039;s which is in like very single game and you just flat out deal no damage to the Riven&#039;s, Kha&#039;Zix&#039;s and even Talons that take it whilst having no escape mechanism.\r\n\r\nThis patch and the last few have left her lower and lower on the viable list and she is a 1/100 game pick and only taken if you have a huge frontline but even then lacks a lot of damage on their front-line so your front-line just plain loses to Champions like Twitch, Tristana and Kog&#039;Maw who all got insane buffs, plus Twitch and Kog have huge Blade of the Ruined King Synergy and you literally escalated 9 ADC&#039;s above Jinx in a few patches which is really just plain not fair for people who like playing the hyper positioning Loose Cannon.","replies":[{"poster":"JasonWazza","date":"2015-09-06T10:18:54.982+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Oh quit your whining jinx is the highest win rate ADC.","replies":[{"poster":"Jink","date":"2015-09-06T11:27:55.489+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Ashe and Varus have higher win rates, but with the Changes to Armor - Champions like Gap closer AD Assassins have been buffed (Yasuo, Talon, Zed) all of whom dunk on Jinx, plus The recent Randuin's Changes destroy her Crit based build and has been being taken on Assassins like Riven and Kha'Zix as well as Tanks and supports and Bruisers - so since last patch she is in a really bad place and I doubt win rates reflect anything in a game that changes this often, so while you might happily quote her win rates - if you actually look at what has happened in league in the patch like a week ago and run the numbers through your head - you'd see she's much weaker than previously and all the statistics in the world wont keep up with patches that heavily influence the game and while you might disagree - Jinx is terrible with Blade and average with alternate builds and was nerfed unnecessarily and is now even more weak.\n\nTrist wrecks a Turret in 5 seconds and Jinx isn't allowed to?\n\nShe doesn't have a stronger lane phase than Trist.
