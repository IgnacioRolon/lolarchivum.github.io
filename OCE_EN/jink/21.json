She's more of a headache to deal with then OP. Letting a Katarina through ban phase is like playing LoL on \"I trust my team aren't idiots\" mode, which isn't smart LOL\n\nThe top 4 bans worldwide are Zed, Le Blanc, Katarina and Sejuani with over 60% ban rates then it drops to like a 30% ban rate on the 5th most banned.\nPeople just don't like playing against Assassins.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Olee","date":"2015-04-26T11:19:07.192+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Kat sux if you aren't a dickhead.
