although I see that it could be for other reasons IE it&#039;s easier to sort out problems that arise from the media form while it is kept under wraps but that&#039;s just me seeing what they don&#039;t do as something they have done) and think that if people embraced the media form and endured the problems it caused it would eventually solve it&#039;s own problems.\n\n\nI think that internet use has been limited and the media has been kept down by societies highers and that this is wrong and something should be done about it.\n\nThis media form and the media in general should flourish and it is actually going downhill in some ways simply by being kept underwraps or by not being embraced by society as a gateway to a better future.\n\nI don&#039;t see that a future where Games are hyper-realized and media becomes a Giant in our lives as solving all the worlds problems, but I think it solves a lot of problems in society right now - difficulty sharing with people because of limits to social groupings along with a lack of fun activities but I think having these things - feeding Africa would be a little easier to endure - seeing as fit and happy people are more useful and more likely to share the positivity.\n\nThe World is not getting better anywhere near the rate it could be and I think we need to stop the social and economical cramping along with all the technical bull and let the World go where it wants to go and think that Government organizations that centuries ago worked together to provide working Aquaducts and social events is now slipping up by not using their power to direct efforts to make things better for us all.\n\nThe internet could be made free, technology could be made free and people could work to make a better world - rather than just to better their own lives.\n\nThings are better when you share and a hundred years ago people worked their butts off for free to make the world a better place and now everything is about how many dollars can one corporate Giant make - rather than providing a free and awesome service it is dipping into our daily lives and we are left in shallow, meaningless jobs with no one solving the big issues and I don&#039;t see this problem going away, it gets worse every day; people are losing quality of life more and more and someone needs to do some real work around here before it all falls apart.\n\nI don&#039;t like war but I can understand the motivations.\n\nI don&#039;t like working but I would be happier working to make the world better and I don&#039;t see my money-grubbing as making the world better.\n\nI would like to lead people into a better future but the people leading us to the future refuse to be idealistic and instead choose to be realists - getting away with denying fantasy over fiction and infinitely capable of stating facts that mean nothing and do nothing but deny what we are capable of through it not having happened and through cramping our style as a world.\n\nWe are capable of much better things and we do nothing.\n\nSitting back and letting these dictators quote numbers and state their workings for a better tomorrow is rubbish.\n\nSomeone needs to put them in their place, someone needs to eliminate barriers and borders and steer the whole world somewhere better - and if it ends up being the wrong person that gets into power or if it is simply one person with their hand on a thousand nuclear bombs rather than us as a society; the worlds not going to get better - and if you take a quick look at who is leading - now - today; they&#039;re just people that understand or at the very least are content with doing nothing about the fact most of their safety, security and quality of life is simply having those weapons behind their backs and there are many hungry and dangerous people in the world and many smart people and if someone doesn&#039;t change things either it&#039;s simply not going to be valhallah living on Earth one day as I believe it could be - with ease - or it could - rather than simply slowly getting slighlty better until it bottoms out at a semi-decent world it could also be a lot worse than the horrors we have faced in the past, or the horrors in our imagination.\n\nI know it&#039;s not the best place to state things like this but I think we need to start somewhere - and what better place to start than the world that incorporates gaming into other media and sports, creating a new realm of fun altogether and I think it&#039;s something worth discussing and if nothing more - a starting point we should focus on and a fact we know - that this is a lot better than the unhealthiness of Video gaming for our bodies; so focusing on the future we could endure what is now a development stage for a possible boom to our lives - and as a side effect I think this would make the world a better place through peripheral effects which is always nice.\n\nI&#039;m losing hope, I don&#039;t see change happening and while I love having fun - I know it wouldn&#039;t take a lot to make the world more fun - today and even I would be happy devoting my life to making the world better for our future generations and would be happy sacrificing my short existence here through hard work and diligence - if I knew that&#039;s what was happening. But that&#039;s really not what&#039;s happening and I wish it was.","replies":[{"poster":"Jink","date":"2015-08-19T11:31:01.709+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I guess my point is - creating something awesome or making something awesome and being rewarded with power and money isn't what I think makes the world a better place; it's making something free.\n\nThis is something I think Riot did that is awesome and I'm proud of Pendragon and what came from Riot Games as an entirety; but if I made something awesome - I'd want the Government to take part in it and sponsor it and support it and help develop it in other ways, rather than just have to do it myself or spend my own money to make it better and set up an income to promote or ensure its future and I think it's wrong that society and/or the highers in our society don't do this and don't make things better and I think something needs to be done.\n\nI think if we encouraged the Government to sponsor Riot; through all their political lingo and all their ideas and best thinkers thoughts we could ignore their deterrence to the idea and state the simple fact that it could lead to a better future for the world; through the above stated facts in the above post and that it - at the very least - is worth a shot and would also state that I am unhappy that they don't do things like this and would like to ask what their ancestors would think of them, for all they have done and would more to the point like to ask what society thinks of them and I think they would know the answer and think they need a reality check.","replies":[{"poster":"Jink","date":"2015-08-19T11:32:54.202+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I mean how awesome would it be if other Companies jumped on board and started developing Riot through government sponsorship.\n\nIt would create jobs and more to the point make developing a long and lasting game that possibly betters the world not only easier but in my opinion - possible.","replies":[{"poster":"Jink","date":"2015-08-19T11:40:29.270+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I mean the only thing stopping me making my dreams a reality is power and I think other people share the same dreams and it's people in powers job to make the world better and I'm disappointed in how things are and how the world is and think something needs to be done.\n\nIt is possible.\n\nWhen I work I sell advertisements to people.

They say no to capitalism but are not helping because they are not preparing themselves for the future which I think is the best thing we can do in this situation at the moment. \n\nWe have no power because democracy is an illusion, the government can do whatever they want and the only way we gain wind of it is if the media exposes it and publicly shames them. Although all forms of media ownership are being collected by a select few who support the government so soon we will not even have this liberty of free information and we will be left in the dark only gaining updates every few months from broken promises.\n\nKnowledge is power my friend and you better keep yourself safe because people who are disillusioned about it all are the first to go when in an influential position.\n\nThe government does not want the population to be empowered","replies":[]},{"poster":"Enlightened One","date":"2015-08-20T03:48:50.366+0000","up_votes":0,"down_votes":0,"body":"I want to know who you are.

Thinking more along the lines of an actual Arena the size of summoners rift with Tournaments where you are each in an Arena linked up digitally battling it out in matches with skills like fireballs and stuff lol and like you have a wrist band and activate a dash ability and it warps you through the field digitally even though you haven't moved so that it moves the field around you but with interaction of nodes and stuff and where your movements are calculated so your movements through the Arena are tracked and move the digital Arena displayed around you but with maybe Hazard beacons displayed in front of you when you are physically going to bump into the walls of the Arena and another wrist band you hit that reorients the Arena to rotate it 180 degrees so you can continue battling it out or whatever by turning around and hitting the 180 switch on the digital arena overlay so you can continue with actual interactions.\n\nI own a Wii. Lol. Clocked Zelda twilight Princess. A lot of the games on it suck though because they are too aim oriented like Prince of Persia where there are pinpoint aiming things and it's really annoying - Zelda is like this but not as much, like you have to aim your bow and hookshot and stuff but theres a lot of other stuff. Just heaps of the games on it are bad and there are a lot of problems with games where they've introduced interactivity but it is poorly designed where you have to make repetitive arm motions and hold your arms up and stuff and it gets really straining but I like a fair few of the games on it. I'm more into fighting games and stuff and there aren't really any on Wii so I'll be getting a Ps4 when Tekken comes out. I love Tekken lol. And Soul Calibur - and there are heaps of other good games on playstation and having a hand controller is usually better than the Wii remote which is ok but I think it needs to be more accurate and stuff and games need to rely less heavily on it. The sensor isn't perfect when it could be, but it would bump the price up however I think that it's necessary for developers to bring great products at an actual price but they are too concerned with making money and just pump out a console that could be so much more and then rather than bettering the console with upgrade bring out disposable console number X with a whole remake of games. I think its bad for game developers too and game devlopers don't pool their ideas and stuff with all the rights and stuff, they could make a billion times better games if others helped them and the game makers could focus more on future products for the same upgradable console and also pool resources and ideas etc and make the gaming industry 5 times as good.","replies":[{"poster":"Chicken4dinner","date":"2015-08-19T23:16:59.449+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I am responding to the first 4 lines of this spiel because as much as I wish to read all of it I don't have time :')\n\nThis future of video games will likely become a reality in the next 30 or so years but because of overpopulation concerns and rising poverty in all sectors thanks to the housing crisis I believe this will only be enjoyed by around 3% of the general populace and envied by the rest of the world.\n\nThough I believe our generation can turn this dark future around.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Chicken4dinner","date":"2015-08-19T23:48:11.606+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I have finished your epic speech, I think the thing that would make this world a better place is simply tolerance.\n\n- Tolerance for our family\n- Tolerance for our friends\n- Tolerance for the homeless guy who knocks on our door ever night\n- Tolerance for those in a lower socio economic\n- Tolerance for those in a higher socio economic\n- Tolerance for those in power that make bad decisions \n- Tolerance for the annoying co-worker or school mate\n- Tolerance for your boss who seems to get a payrise whenever a co-worker gets laid off (get angry of course but don't discriminate)\n- Tolerance for those charity muggers who have no tolerance for people who don't share their views \n\nI am sure you get the idea, however if you don't I am not saying don't care about the dodgy things people can do or some of the shit you might not agree with but these people are people.
