I understand she could be overpowered with a larger mana pool but all you&#039;d need to do is weaken a few other skills and she would actually be playable in more than &quot;the occasional&quot; games.\r\n\r\nI&#039;ve seen her do decently as a jungler because of blue buff - having blue buff as a top laner still has her running OOM insanely quickly - she has no decent waveclear without using mana - even with Trinity force, Blade of the Ruined King and Phantom Dancer she takes forever to clear, she has high single target burst and then is out of mana and 100% useless 9 times out of 10.\r\n\r\nIf I am a fed poppy and constantly running OOM with little or no choice but to build a flat mana and CDR item - setting back my assassination potential to become more tank - the AD carries are just gonna get away since I cant keep up the DPS output and she just becomes a &quot;fighter&quot; when she is classed as an assassin and should play like one - but all other Assassins have decent or no mana costs (Rengar, Kha&#039;Zix, Talon, Akali, Zed, Eve etc) and she has 400 mana at level 6 with 1 small burst skill costing 90, an E costing 125 and a W costing 70 - which is 3/4 of your mana pool in one combo - god forbid you cast ulti and run completely oom - losing your dash and your movespeed steroid leaving you as a &quot;harasser&quot; at best, 9 times out of ten - in the best cases.","replies":[{"poster":"SkarSkarSkarner","date":"2015-10-13T07:58:45.523+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Level1Pentakill,realm=OCE,application-id=Ntey9fRZ,discussion-id=f8g5Km3d,comment-id=,timestamp=2015-10-12T18:30:21.091+0000)\n>\n> Just played her in top lane and I E&#039;d a Riven (Assuredly against wall) just as she popped her 3rd Q and the dash cancelled my wall charge into stun (really annoying) and the same thing happened with dashing to a Lee Sin who used W - he just escaped the dash.\n> \n> Is there a reason my E doesn&#039;t follow him through his W?\n> \n> Also her E is interruptible which is why I think the Riven 3rd Q cancelled it but it actually looked like it was just the dash component that cancelled me wall-banging her - it didn&#039;t look like her 3rd Q caused the stun in time because all she did was start doing her in air flip for the 3rd Q and it cancelled the knockback from my E as if the dash simply negated the knockback (is this how it works?).\n> \n> Also I don&#039;t have a problem with Poppy except for one thing - She&#039;s an Assassins and the only thing I find she lacks is a mana pool - which is a problem you can do little about.\n> \n> I think being such a high DPS with a strong kit for singling out and smashing enemies along with an anti-synergy from tank items (it sort of ruins her passive effect to an extent) - she shouldn&#039;t be expected to build mana items with poor DPS capabilities that cause an anti-synergy to her passive as well as don&#039;t do much for the fact she can just ignore 4 Champions damage and CC anyway for a long period of time - which sort of makes being tank rather pointless and her mana pool is so atrocious with no real good items for her to boost it and it sucks at all stages of the game - she constantly goes OOM which means she can&#039;t utilize her kit and I seriously think something should be done (Like an increase to base mana or mana per level) because I find mana boosting items like Frozen heart, Muramana, Iceborn and banshees don&#039;t do much for her seeing as she can just charge at an enemy carry basically unimpeded and kill them rather quickly as well as the fact these items cut into her DPS immensely and I honestly don&#039;t think she&#039;s designed to be an offtank or w/e and I feel like it&#039;s incredibly frustrating to not even be able to start Dorans blade or shield because of how crap her mana is, buying mana pots does little seeing as she has like 400 mana at level 6 and you have to use like 300 of that to W-E-Q and I honestly think she doesn&#039;t need a rework, I mean she&#039;s underplayed in my opinion because she is so restricted by mana that in the tank meta - even though she&#039;s a tank buster and even though she&#039;s still played sometimes - she has many weaknesses and having to actually cast multiple skills in team fights leaves you OOM in 2.0 seconds and even vs squishy teams where fights are short she goes OOM so fast its literally crippling.\n> \n> I still have successful games with her and I still enjoy playing her but there are so many occasions where managing mana leaves you falling out on utilizing your kit and shes seriously not worth playing because of how restricting her mana pool is.\n> \n> She&#039;s like an AP based AD Assassin and as such seems to have the same kind of mana costs as APs but with a resulting weakness as an AD in all but the rarest of circumstances.

New Poppy will be roughly the same along with Yorick and Taric. So no point making any changes to her.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Jink","date":"2015-10-13T08:20:12.737+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"This is what Meddler said (Riot) \"Do you think Poppy should be changed into a tank from a burst/assassin\":\n\n\"I do feel tank is a good fit for Poppy. She’s a determined, honorable, warrior who wants to be right in the middle of the fight. Her signature gameplay traits are a hammer smash, charging someone into a wall and being extremely hard to kill, all of which can fit well with the tank class (think more Sion as a tank, than Braum as a tank).\n\nCertainly, she’s also got a lot of kill potential at present. Extremely hard to kill or CC, really burst champion with some mobility’s not a good combo though, and it’s only held in check at present since Poppy’s early game is atrocious and she’s kept a bit weak in general. Of the two sides of her we could focus on the tank/fighter side seems like a much better fit to me than the assassin/burst side.\"\n\nLike I don't understand why they're reworking her. They said she's too hard to balance in another post IIRC but Riots motto is \"Nothing is impossible\" and I agree with the motto - not the decision to rework her instead. All she needs is balancing and they're gonna turn her into a tank.\n\nPersonally hate tanks. Hate playing them. Hate versing them.\n\n90% of their job is run around looking for targets instead of being edgy or high skilled Champs most of them are complete noob cannons with a 10% effort put into the game being a 100% effective job.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Bipolar","date":"2015-10-13T06:31:31.524+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Poppy's garbage mana is what stops her from being gutted.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Gravelord","date":"2015-10-12T23:45:16.924+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I don't understand why champions like Poppy have crazy mana usage and champions like Katarina and Garen have no resource component","replies":[{"poster":"Jink","date":"2015-10-12T23:53:14.725+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I know lol I hit Q twice and then W and I'm oom.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Jink","date":"2015-10-12T18:33:21.009+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Mana  235 – 745\n\nDevastating Blow  COST: 55 mana COOLDOWN: 8 / 7 / 6 / 5 / 4  \n\nParagon of Demacia  COST: 70 / 75 / 80 / 85 / 90 mana\n\nHeroic Charge  COST: 60 / 65 / 70 / 75 / 80 mana\n\nDiplomatic Immunity  RANGE: 900 COST: 100 mana \n\n235 mana level one, 2 Q's, 1 W and one E at level 6 and you are OOM -for 600 damage then you are useless.\n\nThose mana costs or that mana pool are a joke.","replies":[]}]}
