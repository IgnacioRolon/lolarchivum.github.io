Riot removes 100 hp and 10 armor to replace it with a small damage reduction that only applies to crit, this is actually an overall nerf to the item. the slow could far exceed what its capped at now, reaching up to around 6-10 sec slow on unis with very high armor and magic resist. It's slow was reduced, the overall hp and armor was reduced, all replaced with a 10 (20 for mastery)damage reduction on attacks critting for 200 damage (190 after reduction(no infinity edge)) as the 10% only applies to the bonus crit damage. People with infinity edge critting for 250 would still only have a pretty low reduction of 15 (30 for mastery)(50% more than no infinity) applied. Unless the tank also gets the crit reduction mastery this doesn't do that much for protection. The item was overall nerfed, it just stacks decently with the mastery. For crits of 1000, 100 (150 for ie) reduction isn't that trivial, but, maybe the reduction from both the mastery and item together might seem to be strong (300 for ie 200 without ie)\n\nyes the 300 reduction isn't that trivial, but you still melt enemies at the same speed, and only tanks and bruisers would buy it, maybe an adc looking for an adc dueling alternative.\n\nAll in all, this change is only really effective if it has the mastery to accompany it. This item would be strong if it applied to the overall damage (giving 600 reductions overall for an ie crit of 1000, with mastery) but because it is only the bonus crt damage affected, it really isn't that scary, and shouldn't affect the time it takes to kill a tank by that much longer.","replies":[{"poster":"Jink","date":"2015-08-26T02:23:59.450+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"http://leagueoflegends.wikia.com/wiki/Randuin's_Omen :\n\"New Passive: 10% reduced damage from Critical strikes.
