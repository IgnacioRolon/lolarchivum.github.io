Can Yasuo ult an enemy Ziggs when he goes airborne with W?\n\"Nope. There were iterations of Yasuo's ult that worked on any jump as well as knock up and they were incredibly frustrating to say the least :p. Tristana especially got screwed because she has such a long cast time on Rocket Jump.\" - SmashGizmo\n\nQ. Will Yasuo's ult work on targets that are leaping or targets knocked up by neutral monsters?\n\"Last Breath, Yasuo’s R, can be cast on any knockup or knockback applied by Yasuo himself or one of his teammates. The ability is about coordination and synergy, so it didn’t make sense to include enemy leaps (such as Tristana’s Rocket Jump) or neutral monster knock ups (such as those cast by Baron/Vilemaw). \nWe actually playtested a version where Yasuo could grab enemy champions who leapt out of the air with his ult. It seemed cool on paper. In practice, I, who was playing Yasuo, spent the entire post-6 laning phase mashing the R button while RiotFan, sitting next to me playing Jax, refused to ever once use his Leap Strike.
