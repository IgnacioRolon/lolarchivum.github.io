When I Was younger I never liked the concept of gaming on a computer because I felt like it was an awkward setup (A Keyboard) but put me on a first person shooter and I would smash up, I was never at a high level in games like Tekken though and I feel like I loved those sort of Games but lacked the commitment - but when I got older, playing at a net Cafe I felt I adopted Dota very quickly although when we had lan tournaments or in-house 5v5&#039;s etc everyone was similar but me and a close few friends were at the top of the pack and a lot of my other friends who played different games sorta sucked but occasionally did really good in the Moba field - but in Counter-strike, one of my friends was rated best AWPer in Australia and competed in Au and overseas and a fair few of my friends were incredible at Counter Strike; but when I take people on in Games like Tekken now I feel like I lack the style required but in planning things out etc and playing Moba&#039;s feel like I do average, so I feel like my performance and achievements in Games are far more about what I like as a person and my style than what I learn, because I played a lot of CS and never got anywhere near my friends level, let alone pro level (Had some games tho that were good) and I played fighting Games throughout life and never got beyond a mid level - even with a heap of practice in newcomers and with experience under my belt so I&#039;d just like to know if people feel you can break the mould that is you and exceed in something you put your mind to without extreme effort and whether practice really does make perfect or you are pre-ordained to be at a certain level or notch in the reality that is a Video games competive rating.","replies":[{"poster":"Essembie","date":"2015-12-22T02:38:17.467+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Both","replies":[]},{"poster":"VENI VIDI VICI","date":"2015-12-22T02:31:32.319+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Well mechanics are acquired. Thought process and awareness/concentration is probably more natural.","replies":[]},{"poster":"LemonHunter","date":"2015-12-21T23:44:48.607+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Interesting conversation topic. Here's my two cents.\n\nI feel it's pretty hard to narrow down to just gaming skills. There is so much that goes into being good at a game, ability to read maps, spacial awareness, reflexes, decision making to name a few.\n\nSome of these skills are natural, others are learned. Some people may have naturally quicker reflexes than other people, which can help them in very fast paced games such as getting that quick entry frag in CS, reacting to those skill shots in LoL or pulling off those perfect combos in Tekken. But, increasing your reflex time is something that you can also learn to do, along with the other skills required to excel at games.\n\nSo I think that the fundamentals and the building blocks of gaming skill can be natural, but can also be acquired and improved upon. Some will learn much faster than others and a lot easier than others, but I think if someone has the dedication to and the correct practice, they can get better at games :)","replies":[]},{"poster":"Yuriklatura","date":"2015-12-25T03:32:10.338+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'd say both. If a 40 year old man were to pick up a PS4 controller and try to play Bloodborne, he'd try for 9 hours just to get to the first boss. But an 18 year old kid would eventually learn the mechanics of the game. Eventually.\n\nIf anyone plays Bloodborne, you know what I'm talking about. Also, Orphan of Kos is best boss.","replies":[]},{"poster":"drag66n","date":"2015-12-22T02:15:55.845+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"1v1s a more accurate skill rating, you dont play 5v5 chess","replies":[{"poster":"LemonHunter","date":"2015-12-22T05:32:26.992+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"But a lot of competitive games, such as CS, LoL etc are team based games. Not everyone works well with others in a team environment. This is definitely a skill that is needed to succeed. There is only so far individual skill can get you in team based games.","replies":[{"poster":"drag66n","date":"2015-12-22T07:45:01.830+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"well i learnt the perogative of my \"skill\" (being transferrable outside the one immediate exercise) predominantly in heavy 1v1 competition. I was matched with and actively sought out the greatest differences (greater than) i nskill i could find and thus had a huge ELO/skill rating with far fewer games and a lower win rate then relative conservatives. from that foundational basis i intergrated into teamcomp play and excelled at that. maxed. you have to die A LOT in moba to truely learn. a unique thing moreso to this genre of gaming then others. learn from every mistake, every engaugement, wake the fuck up.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Alfawarrior3","date":"2015-12-22T05:57:04.374+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"both.\neveryone is natural good at something, probably.\nbut everyone can also practice at something to become good at it.\nno one starts out at pro level play, they practice to get there.","replies":[]}]}
