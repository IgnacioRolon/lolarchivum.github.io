I ported into mid and was mashing E after right clicking a Vel&#039;Koz and my champion was spinning on the spot rapidly behind minions - I thought it was a minion block bug but then it happened again later when I was pathing down mid to do the same thing and dash to the Vel&#039;Koz - Poppy just froze in place and ran around in fast circles.\n\n2. I think it&#039;s a bug, but I ulted a Shen and he went sideways up in top lane and didn&#039;t really get knocked up and just got pushed to the side really quickly even though it was a 3/4 Channeled ulti. (He went flat to the left instead of toward his spawn pool and only went like 400 Units).\n\nThe E bug was game breaking, happened twice and completely shut down both my engages.","replies":[{"poster":"Proxima Solaris","date":"2015-12-09T03:03:50.284+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"i've had the e bug happen to me once when i built devourer. did you also get it with devourer?","replies":[{"poster":"Jink","date":"2015-12-09T03:24:16.682+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Proxima Solaris,realm=OCE,application-id=Ntey9fRZ,discussion-id=gToE9XiE,comment-id=0000,timestamp=2015-12-09T03:03:50.284+0000)\n>\n> i've had the e bug happen to me once when i built devourer. did you also get it with devourer?\n\nNah first game was Cleaver and Deadman's, second was Warriors. It happened in my third game too. She just freezes and runs in circles when you're chasing people and trying to Heroic Charge them.","replies":[]}]}]}
