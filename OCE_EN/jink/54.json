Please don&#039;t sacrifice Looks for usability. I have no idea why you would remove this as it comes in handy if you want to Kayle ult and Ally in a team fight when everyone is bunched up and you can see their HP on the left and know they&#039;re being focused down and using the Champion tab helps guarantee you don&#039;t misclick on a different ally.","replies":[{"poster":"Bipolar","date":"2015-06-04T14:07:26.482+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"http://i.gyazo.com/b516ec3560081c668d2dcadbd85dda80.png","replies":[{"poster":"Jink","date":"2015-06-08T15:02:03.672+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yeah it's normally big and on the left, now it's tiny little microdots above the map.","replies":[]}]}]}
