Does it serve any real purpose other than a team saving ability? You just blow the enemy doing all the damage to kingdom come and save your team from dying, since if you throw an enemy away they are most likely free to survive another day.\n\nIf you use the ult as a killing move, which most ults should be used, either to secure a kill or help your team get the kills, than the throwing part is completely useless, it serves nothing more than lols that trolls are going to use it for.","replies":[{"poster":"Jink","date":"2015-11-25T12:48:33.206+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Knock people out of Kindred ulti (This can be used since the knockback heads them towards their base so if you are behind them you can single people out etc and can still be used smartly to knock a few out so Kindred or whoever is left alone and vulnerable, plus it can be used to reset fights to some extent regardless which can beat a team who use their ults to engage and position favourably).\n\nKnockbacks on Morgana's ulting if she has shield down.\n\nKnockbacks on their frontline so your Assassins or whatever can go to work with the frontline CC/defense or whoever or whatever being 3000 units away from helping (situational).\n\nI think it'll be most popular as a defense, to knock back their carries that are winning fights, to knockback their frontline or supports to open up an engage on their carries, as a tower diving tool, after flash to knockback their carries so their frontline has no DPS behind them which can turn fights and as an escape mechanism.\n\nIt has a lot of utility, it just seems a bit overkill to have it knock them back 3000 range at max charge since that is pretty game breaking if her kit makes up for this powerful utility.","replies":[{"poster":"fattyhotdogs","date":"2015-11-26T02:03:57.634+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Alistar can do literally everything you just mentioned, on a much lower cool down","replies":[{"poster":"Jink","date":"2015-11-26T18:47:22.645+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yeah true.

If she has good scaling with like Trinity force and Youmuu's or something or is a Trinity tank like Irelia who can go a bit more aggressive or a bit more defensive it'll be a strong utility.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Roguestoney","date":"2015-11-25T20:17:21.026+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I wonder if you can charge flash it and knock them into your fountain.
