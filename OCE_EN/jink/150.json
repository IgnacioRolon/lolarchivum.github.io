I think she is in an okay spot for now =P Although in my latest game I feel like Juggernauts really overpower her as she has no kiting potential.\n\nhttp://champion.gg/champion/Diana","replies":[{"poster":"Jink","date":"2015-09-07T03:12:18.995+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I was trying to kite out a Nidalee in a clutch melee brawl today coz I knew nid had 125 range and I had 150 but it didn't quite work out but Olafs coming at you and stuff are basically GG - I think with the Changes to AP items though, being such an early-mid Assassins she is in a good spot, but I guess a lot of the other AP mids got just as much of a benefit out of it - It just feels like in being an Assassins she hits power spikes sooner and a lot harder than a lot of Champs and she's also good at dealing with all the Yasuos, Zed's and Talons mid and the Runeglaive addition made her once strong jungle even better\n\nI thought her win rate would be like 53% tbh - seeing her in a lot of games lately in mid lane and in the jungle - and Riot tends to catch on to these spam picks quickly...","replies":[]}]}]}
