Assassins are not supposed to initiate fights, talon doesn't initiate a teamfight, Ahri can with charm picks, but she's not really an assassin anymore, and much closer to a kite mage. Zed is trash in teamfights lategame as well. Akali's R range is \"shit\" because she has three of them\"\n\nIn fact very few assassins actually have a way out mechanic EXCEPT zed and LB. EG Nocturne can't leave once he's in, Kat can only leave IF she gets the kill, Rengar isn't leaving anytime soon, Kha only gets out if he gets the kill, Eve only gets her speed boost back if she gets the kill, Ekko can leave, but needs to use his ulti to do so, and only has four seconds to get out or he's fucked.\n\nMeanwhile you dash wrongly you have tools like shroud to run back out at superspeed, or ward over a wall and dash to a jungle creep or minion wave. There is nothing wrong with the champion, you're just bad at her.","replies":[{"poster":"Jink","date":"2015-11-22T12:35:48.452+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Kha has 2-3 Invis's with movespeed to get into and out of the fray repeatedly and you are dead wrong.\n\nAkali's \"way out\" mechanics are trash and verse decent players she is trash.\n\nYou can argue that in solo queue she does OK or reference a few high elo players with success with her, but fact is if she's not a counter-pick or picked into a certain comp she's trash and unlike other Assassins who are a semi-safe first pick or early pick and don't need to be picked around to the same extent - she's does.\n\nShe will never see play at worlds in her current state and she is a joke Champion.\n\nAlso you're making it personal and half of what you stated is wrong btw, IE Zed is trash in team fights (This is where he does his job best and excels IE go watch a faker video) also that Ahri's not really an Assassin anymore and she is an Assassin now more than ever and Akali's R range isn't sh-t because she has 3 of them, it's because she deleted carries and got away with it so Riot nerfed her into the ground to compensate for sooking carries who whinged about no counterplay because they didn't know what pink wards were and now they get a free Trinket to reveal her and it's time Riot reverted the changes.\n\nShe was a noob stomp Champion and Riot went and nerfed her for the noobs. GG wp.\n\nAlso your point about Talon was null and Void.\n\nAkali's R range is terrible for a Champion with her Kit.\n\nToo often you need to flash.\n\nBtw Ekko has a massive Shield and can ulti whilst still in a fight for a substantial heal and massive AOE damage.\n\nHis entire Kit is broken which is why he's played as a Jungler (still) and Akali is a joke tier laughable pick and if someone picked her at worlds 1st pick I would laugh all the way to the defeat banner for that team and in almost any comp if they took her as a later pick would be literally lol'ing.","replies":[{"poster":"A Moist Crevice","date":"2015-12-04T21:45:09.318+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You claim Ekko is broken but he has a lower winrate than akali.\n\nAkali also still noobstomps, its just noobs can't play her to noobstomp anymore.\n\nHow is my point about talon null and void, you said he can initiate, he can't initate unless you're silver as fuck and LET him.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Jink","date":"2015-11-22T12:36:16.540+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"She might be better this season but she's still Trash Tier.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Olee","date":"2015-11-21T02:22:11.382+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Lol","replies":[]},{"poster":"fattyhotdogs","date":"2015-11-16T21:26:28.903+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"1- why are you engaging?
