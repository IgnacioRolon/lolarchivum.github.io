Yeah that&#039;s fair.\n\nHow can you build someone like this and still do damage? Really doesn&#039;t suit the game. The games declined since you removed Deathfire Grasp because ADCs cried about getting blown up instantly, yet their team could do the same thing and it was their own fault/misplay that it happened and now we have 5K HP tanks walking around that are just obnoxious in your face auto-attack machines that take 0 skill, timing or anything and just brute force their way through games like that&#039;s better than noob carries getting instagibbed or intense fights. Half the players in the game are resorting to tankier mid laners, top laners and junglers because they&#039;re obnoxious and overpowered and Deathfire Grasp was OP?\n\nLeast it wasn&#039;t stale, like Malphite&#039;s lane phase and entire game.\n\nP.s Liandry's is f00kin sh33t. Coz I want flat pen on %dmg vs HP MR stackers with 400 MR and that flat pen is good and it's a good item early game on anyone but like Rumble and 2% current HP damage is useful and it is in general useful against anyone else but the tanks.","replies":[{"poster":"Lord Sesshomaru","date":"2015-12-15T00:46:54.035+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I just don't understand Garen, they build LITERALLY no offensive items, yet his Q halves your HP and his E does the rest, and of course if he doesn't feel like chasing you around for an extra second he can press R to deal 1500 true damage...\n\nlike if you're a tank you shouldn't do that much damage \n\nand if you're a damage dealer you shouldn't be that hard to kill..","replies":[{"poster":"Jink","date":"2015-12-15T06:12:28.348+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Lord Sesshomaru,realm=OCE,application-id=Ntey9fRZ,discussion-id=NEF2EQJu,comment-id=0000,timestamp=2015-12-15T00:46:54.035+0000)\n>\n> I just don't understand Garen, they build LITERALLY no offensive items, yet his Q halves your HP and his E does the rest, and of course if he doesn't feel like chasing you around for an extra second he can press R to deal 1500 true damage...\n> \n> like if you're a tank you shouldn't do that much damage \n> \n> and if you're a damage dealer you shouldn't be that hard to kill..\n\nYeah lol. I had Athenes and Deathcap as Lulu and he had Frozen heart and banshee's with a bamis cinder and he was out dps'ing me in 1v1s. I was basically getting out dps' because while I'm bursting for like 100 he's meting me to death with bami's like 15 damage a second.\n\nGarens not so bad, he's usually only like that if he gets ahead.\n\nSome of these Champs would fail all game if they had low base damage but the health per damage scale tips hugely in their favor once they have some defensive items which I think is why they're played consistently.\n\nIt's like Mundo, refuses to even take Damage and is killing ADCs and AP Carries in like 5 seconds.","replies":[]}]}]}
