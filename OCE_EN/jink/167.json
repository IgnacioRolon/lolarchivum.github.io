Yi was already strong with Blade but it was let slide because other Champions were usually more played, now he is a jungle joke.","replies":[{"poster":"She Loves Me","date":"2015-08-15T15:43:49.369+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"devourer has made every champion that uses it strong lol. \nkayle, shyv, yi, fizz etc. Yi doesnt need a nerf and he isn't the worst out of them.
