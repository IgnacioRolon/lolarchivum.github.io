Even to vs.\n\nIf his W was maybe multi-target and changed so he could deal with junglers he'd be more aggressive or if he saw some changes he would actually be more of a Champion (I even find him boring to play because his AD and AP builds are far less viable now because of less item options suiting his end-game builds and I find less junglers ganking top leave him with less opportunities for kills and this makes him unviable as anything but a CDR Q-stacker.\n\nI say he's anti-fun because if you aren't prepared to be bored by him, you will be annoyed by him - anti-fun.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Iosua Bot","date":"2015-03-05T23:12:40.438+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Dude u must be playing him wrong ah?\nHe's very technical when stacking his Q yes but he's not anti-fun","replies":[{"poster":"Jink","date":"2015-03-17T08:39:13.649+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"He's as obvious as balls.","replies":[{"poster":"Iosua Bot","date":"2015-03-20T03:44:39.055+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":":D","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"VENI VIDI VICI","date":"2015-03-06T04:38:31.706+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I think we're talking about when you verse the doge.
