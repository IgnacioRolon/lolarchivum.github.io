It's not toxic to say that is it?\n\nI understand people are probably against it so it's a bad thing; so I guess it's classed as Toxic to want that: but how is saying it wrong? I mean it's good to tell the truth; even if it's about wanting a bad thing... especially if you want a bad thing...\n\nIf you gave me a button to blow up and destroy the whole Universe forever; I think i'd push it.\n\nEven if I had to face some Gods punishment first or had to face punishment before doing it - You could punish me before doing it and I'd still do it. I don't think there's anything that could stop me.\n\nI know it sounds horrible and there are good people in the world; and I make the excuse to myself that a Universe with any one evil in it - to me; overall - is a Universe that has failed and is undeserving of existing - for anything that has spawned evil must have a recipe or some tangent where it is allowed; so to me, even if evil is necessary to present good as a nemesis and even if evil is necessary for there to even be good, I think neutrality would be better and that would mean nothing. I mean if there were neutrality, good would just be standard and I guess it's confusing but I see that any one evil act is a Universe that has failed someone and shouldn't exist. Maybe it's all better in the end or things are undone, but I don't see that and I don't believe that so I can't put any faith into this world - but that's just some of my logic behind accepting that I want this, really it's just a feeling that if I was presented with that kind of choice - I would do what I want; not what's right - so even with the logic behind it and the emotion, I see that not doing it would be allowing good to rise above evil but down to my core I'm an evil person and I see that it could be natural or acquired - but either way I don't see evil as deserving of life and while it might seem hypocritical that I'd be taking myself out in that explosion - I really just want to see the world burn and be gone forever.\n\nI'm pretty evil.\n\nIf I told my sister that if I could destroy the whole Universe at will - I would, she'd look at me like I'm crazy. If I told my little sister she'd be angry. My brother would call me stupid and my mum would be disappointed with me - but if I could I honestly would.\n\nPeople hate me. I don't think they understand I hate myself; but more than that I want to kill everybody in the whole entire world.\n\nIt's pretty offensive.\n\nI don't know why I'm trying to explain why this is a good thing and convince you that it is; but it's what I want.\n\nI guess you're right though. It is pretty offensive telling everybody you want to kill them all, but I don't really understand: It's what would make me happy so they should want that right?\n\nI mean why be selfish. People preach all the good they want, but if I want something I can never eliminate that desire. It's never been taken from me, I have reasons (A world that has spawned evil is undeserving of existence) and while they might seem petty I'm pretty sure I'll always feel like this. It's kind of Ironic that the one thing I want most in the world is to be the most evil being in existence, but am denied that option (I don't think I can actually destroy the whole Universe at will) so am basically incapable of Evil. I don't want to do petty things, I just want to blow this whole shet up.\n\nI personally think it would be funny.\n\nIt's kind of sad being evil in handcuffs. It's more sad that people have to restrain others from doing what they want. Evil's a nasty thing in my opinion, because one persons evil often draws others into evil acts, however righteous - the acts commited to fight evil all spawned from one evil and you can see it undermining everyones enjoyment and I honestly think whoever drew first blood won. Reacting to evil, as people seem to see more and more every day - leads to further suffering and lack of enjoyment and everyone is hastily trying to close it down - and in doing so is furtherly causing suffering and lack of enjoyment because they are just trying to snuff out the blaze and not seeing that vengeance will never be stopped and when people want to retaliate - stopping them just annoys them; and as they try to snuff out smaller and smaller blazes and reactions and stop people being antagonized and take the lead in fighting for what's right - the clamps on our freedoms and power grow tighter and tighter and tighter and I for one don't trust the powers that be; to not become evil out of what I consider is a chaotic development - because that's how it appears to have begun in the first place and that's how it appears to begin all over the place so I really don't wanna be clamped by people that have become evil and like it or not, it's when the good guys hurt you suddenly that it hurts the most (I can speak from experience) and when people have turned evil against me, it was nothing like having the pinnacle of good turn on me and tear me to shreds so I will fight forever and while this makes it worse for evil, I see the outcome as good either way because I know what hurts the most and while it might be horrible to want it, it's when you realize that you've turned evil that you're the most tortured person in the Universe so I understand the only way the world could ever turn out and deep down know that good will never win unless we all float off to heaven; because there has been even a single evil act: so I see destroying the whole Universe: as while being the most evil thing ever committed - the best way to further the Universe to it's outcome which I think is necessary for many reasons and one bad person sending everyone straight to hell is sure to cause that point where everyone floats off to heaven and I don't see it happening any other way because I don't think it's right to leave the past behind us and while technology could revive and be putting all current people in heaven; I see simply destroying the whole Universe as a desire of my own to be something necessary because I don't believe certain people deserve a bright future; and while some might see a system that excludes evil and sends them to hell and promotes good and sends them to heaven as a good thing; in my heart I see one evil as a Universe that is a failure and I also see it as a separating line between the contrast of the Universe and see it as an excuse for good people to feel good forever - even though they would have never justified the goodness of themselves without evil to fight against, rise against or be compared to so I see the whole Universe as a failure and an evil system and want to destroy it - nothing will ever change this, no amount of punishment will change the way I think and if someone thinks telling people cleaning up after them would leave you covered in blood - is wrong about this; you should pop into some of my games because while it might be me that feels people are hateful and antagonizing or evil - even if I'm wrong I still want to kill them all for a good reason: I am indifferent to them and would rather just take out both sides because I don't see it ending, I don't see people stopping; I don't see any other way to stop people and the Universe being like this and I don't think I'm wrong in never forgiving; and in being indifferent to good vs evil because I'd rather just end what I see as a joke, do what people do to each other anyway for good and bad reasons and give them a taste of their own medicine in wiping them all out just because inside it feels right and while it may defy my heart; I defy.\n\nYou can have good reasons to kill, America does it. We are founded on warfare and slavery. There are innocents; surrounded by these murderers and heroes and the heroes kill the villains, their hands are stained and I'd just rather put them out of their misery and I know I'm in no position to be a leader of all the innocents - that's what these so called heroes do; murder a murdered and then stick around like they haven't bloodied themselves because of \"logic\". All they need to do is put the poor innocent sheep out of their misery too, god forbid they know what that villain did or that sometimes its necessary to end a life; because it's torturous to know people snap and kill innocents, people don't deserve to live in a world like this and it's their shallow pathetic hearts that stop them, like butterflies slowing them down and stopping them from making the rational call to just end this fiasco of villains and heroes with one fell swoop and just wipe out every victim of a pitiful world like a real hero would and deal with the consequences if there are any.\n\nSupressing things like this with downvotes and bans is pathetic. It's just a sheepish tactic employed to slow down the fear or stop it - which is illogical because then people wont even see the blade coming, or wont know that you should expect it 100% of the time, from anyone and everyone because that is 100% what happens in the real world and it's an absolutely cancerous Universe - so while you might dislike me for saying this, the truth hurts and that's the truth. That's how I see it anyway.\n\nToxicity and ending toxicity is just hiding peoples feelings and in a network where people are safe from identification in most cases; it's a joke to try to hide the realities of peoples minds and only makes them more likely to end up victims.\n\nTrust yourself. I wont lie.\n\nI'm disappointed people can't understand how stupid they are; or that they try snuffing out a fire that they know nothing about; or are villains trying to shut down the opposition because either way you look at it they are 100% pathetic.\n\nhttp://data.whicdn.com/images/85217077/original.gif\n\nDodging bullets forever, forever. That's no life.\n\nI'd rather just end it for everyone.\n\nYou could argue that people could be restrained, but I don't believe in a perfect system because I don't think you could evolve a perfect system from an imperfect one~","replies":[{"poster":"Talon12","date":"2015-12-08T13:21:12.162+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"~2000 words on a topic relating to nothing..\n\nI really don't get how you got something that ludicrous in your head.
