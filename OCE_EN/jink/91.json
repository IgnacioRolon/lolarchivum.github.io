This change to it (Warmogs heart) lets you fully heal without having to back or just heal heaps in like 10-15 seconds and then go for another engage when you're sieging their base or whatever and is sooooooo good.\n\nWith 5K HP - after 8 seconds of not taking damage it activates and will heal you for roughly 100HP a second so that's 30 seconds roughly to be fully healed - after a successful engage and a lot of damage soaking this lets you keep pressure on or continue farming or going for objectives. I see your point though about recalling to buy items but as a Tanky Jungler I like being able to heal heaps late game without having to go back so I can split push, take jungle or do objectives and often I used to be recalling just to heal - now I can continue my efforts because of this item and when I do pick it up, I absolutely adore it.","replies":[{"poster":"Talon12","date":"2015-09-08T11:44:40.081+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"you have not experienced the fun.\n\n5 warmogs (the 200% regen isn't unique, and it gives most hp from item) + Spirit visiage\n\nor 4 warmogs, spirit visiage and a cinderhulk (giving more overall hp)\n\non garen...\n\nI'll let that sink in","replies":[{"poster":"Garens Harem","date":"2015-09-08T12:47:33.183+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Talon12,realm=OCE,application-id=Ntey9fRZ,discussion-id=JzePo0Y6,comment-id=000000000000,timestamp=2015-09-08T11:44:40.081+0000)\n>\n> you have not experienced the fun.\n> \n> 5 warmogs (the 200% regen isn't unique, and it gives most hp from item) + Spirit visiage\n> \n> or 4 warmogs, spirit visiage and a cinderhulk (giving more overall hp)\n> \n> on garen...\n> \n> I'll let that sink in\n\nand then {{champion:67}} comes in and metls you, lifestealing all your damage, while aa-ing in melee range.","replies":[{"poster":"Talon12","date":"2015-09-08T13:06:19.052+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"this is just about the regen, not fighting","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]}
