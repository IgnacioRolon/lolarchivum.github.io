I meant building Armor is not a good idea versus 2 mage carries (Kat and Swain) while they have a Shyv and Trist too (So you're cutting half of half of shyv's damage as well as reducing the 2 AP's damage, but also carving some of the damage off trists Rocket Jump and Buster Shot. Like for reals 10% cost efficacy in that matchup of building armor and 90% cost efficacy of building MR.\n\nShyv is like 50:50 Physical to Magic but actually slants towards magic slightly.\nSwain is 100% AP.\nKatarina is 100% AP.\nSona is pretty much 100% AP.\nTristana is about 20-30% Magic, usually mainly Physical.\n\nThat is like 80% of their teams damage being magic and 2 people are building an armor item, when in team fights almost all of the damage is magic.\n\nComplete waste of gold, when that much of the teams damage is magic. Like for reals you're getting like 10% cost effectiveness when you would have 90% cost effectiveness from MR.\n\nI know trist isn't a mage carry but she still slightly loses out on dmg from MR, Shyv loses a chunk of damage from MR, Katarina loses a heap of Damage from MR, Swain loses a heap of damage from MR and Sona loses most of her Damage from MR and team - at Gold, is buying Armor items which makes 0 sense. Like ok you can take a few more hits from Trist, grats you are now Bursted down by Kat and hurt by Sona ults, Melted by Swain and laughed at as Shyvana Hybrid melts you mainly with burnout Damage and magic damage on - hit and Tristana's Buster shots will even wreck you.\n\nMF Isn't a mage carry she gets like 20 Magic dmg on hit and has Make it Rain which does like 200 Damage, her ulti is physical and so is her double up - I understand MR helps more versus champs like Kog and Corki and to some extent Ez but if you are facing 2 AP Carries and they have a hybrid Jungler and a Sona (who is poke heavy) and they have a trist who herself even does a slight amount of magic dmg and you are building armor you are literally completely wasting Gold when you could have MR and not be wasting 80% of your gold considering 80% of the damage coming at you is Magic, stacking Armor is a bad idea.","replies":[{"poster":"JasonWazza","date":"2015-07-26T01:22:13.147+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Ah your original post wasn't very clear i thought you were calling Trist/Shyv mage carry's.\n\nMF/Ezreal ADC carry around the same magic damage all up (i still don't understand why Ez's spam their W, it's a fucking utility spell)\n\nGiven the champ comp they had you were probably screwed regardless of resistance's as Pen builds are things that Kat's do cause base damage, and swain just amp's his damage anyway, it also depends on the situation though, if you can have Swain/Katarina removed from the fight before they can do damage, then armor is still the way to build, but of course MR should still be itemized.","replies":[{"poster":"Zorphiax","date":"2015-07-27T11:47:45.103+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Ezreal ADC now a days is like seeing a Yorick or Zilean been played, very rare.

But if they're mixed and you're the tank, then buy a mixture of both. Maybe thrown in a thornmail if their ADC is fed, or a spirit visage if you have a Soraka on your team or something of that sort.","replies":[]}]}
