But I can assure you we are aware of the statistics and numbers and are thinking about solutions. There are a lot of things to consider and it takes time to implement balanced changes that affects \"Play Rate\"\n\n* Champion theme ( ninja, samurai, viking, mage, etc)\n* Mechanics (abilities, how it feels to play as the champion, how fun are they to play?)\n* Role ( tank, support, assassin etc)\n* Perceived strength\n* Actual strength\n* Mastery curve (how long does it take to get the basics of a champ? how long to master?)\n\nIf you're super interested in game design discussion head on over to the Dev Corner on the side bar or check out http://ask.fm/RiotGhostcrawler (Ghostcrawler is our design director).\n\nEDIT - found a relevant question and answer from the man himself\n\nhttps://ask.fm/RiotGhostcrawler/answers/135038488203\n> **Season 5, you guys spoke about Champion Diversity being the theme. How do you feel about the current 30+% pickrate for Lee Sin? I don't feel the jungle is diverse enough, with one champion dominating the pick rate so much.**\n> There are a lot of factors that can determine diversity. I use Jinx a lot as an example, because she's a really obvious one. Jinx is enormously popular, sometimes the most popular champion in certain regions, like the US. Some of that is almost always related to power -- you never see very weak champions played at high rates -- but it definitely isn't the whole story. Beyond power, we also think Jinx is fun to play and her personality appeals to a lot of players. It isn't our intent to make Jinx less popular. To do so, we'd have to dilute who she is, or nerf her win rate just to try and force players not to play her. That's bogus. :(\n> Put another way, it isn't a goal, and almost nothing reasonable could achieve, Jinx being played at the same rate as Urgot.\n> The way I define diversity is that you should be able to play who you want without raw power unduly influencing your decision (or your team thinking you are trolling), and you shouldn't see the same champs every game on your team or the other team. I also want to be clear that we aren't there yet, but that's the long-term goal.\n> With that in mind, we know Lee is a very popular champion (especially in China). Some of that has to do with how satisfying he is to play. Some of that has to do with ward hopping. Some of that has to do with power. Some of that probably has to do with seeing videos of really flashy Lee plays.\n> A couple of years ago, we looked at what it would take to make him less popular, and it really would have involved gutting what is cool about him, and we (wisely IMO) chose not to do so. While he is frequently the most popular Jungler, he isn't the one with the highest winrate, particularly at lower ELOs. Rather than touching Lee, what we'd rather do is make sure there are viable alternatives. Xin Zhao is often popular. Mundo is gaining popularity right now. Kindred may end up somewhere up there as players learn him.\n> Trundle has a reasonably high win rate, but a low play rate. Maybe he just isn't as fun. Maybe his abilities aren't as satisfying to use. Maybe only Trundle mains love him, but they play him really well. Maybe there is an opportunity there for us to make more him more fun... but that doesn't mean he will ever be of equal play rate with Lee Sin, and we're fine with that.","replies":[{"poster":"Lord Sesshomaru","date":"2015-12-28T04:56:31.445+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I dont mean to stop your fun, and I'm really sorry :(\nbut getting an answer about this problem from anyone is like getting blood from a stone.\n\nits just extremely frustrating atm that the game is dominated by a select few champs, and that negatively affects the fun of being in game. (to the point where i (and others I've talked to) just don't want to play anymore because we've played the same game with the same champs over and over and over again) and RIOT don't seem to be doing anything about it.\n\ni did check out your post and discussed it at length at the time. Most of the points i brought up i still feel are valid and they was a month or so ago.\n\nGhostCrawler doesn't really say anything in that excerpt there tbh except that lee sin (one of the major problems) is just being ignored and its going to stay that way, which is not entirely helpful in my opinion. Vayne has had a solid 25/30% pick rate all year and nothing has been done about that either. \n\nBasically the solution GhostCrawler is offering; is to buff all the champs around the problem instead of tackling the actual problem. \nWhich was shown by the marksman update as not working (lets bring up ALL the other marksman to vayne/jinx's level instead of bringing those two down) and all that did was change the entire gameplay of the meta, as well as adding MF and Lucian to 'must ban in every game' list while just making vane's play rate go up even higher instead of bringing it down.\n\nits like the tall poppy syndrome, if a blade of grass sticks up above the rest, we cut it down, we don't water every single individual other blade of grass to try and grow them up to that level do we? if you told a gardener to do that he'd quit. RIOT are the gardeners of league, so don't waste all your tank's water and hours and hours of labour trying to fix a problem that a tiny pair of scissors and 2 seconds will do instead.\n\nif we ignore who is powerful (because lets be honest, power is the only reason these champs are popular) and just buff everyone else (which is what Ghostcrawler proposes) then it just becomes an arms race until eventually everyone just one hits everyone else and then pick rates wont matter because everyone's power has plataued (and i cant speak for GhostCrawler but that doesn't sound very fun to me.)\n\nA hypothetical situation is: America has too many nukes, i think we can all agree that giving china and north korea and russia the same amount of nukes to balance it out, is not a good idea, instead we should be taking away america's nukes so no one has nukes instead. Its the same here, instead of giving Mundo and Xin more nukes, we should just take away some of lee's.\n\nThis arms race is already starting to happen, you die much much quicker in game now, as everyone is building full AD or full crit in order to keep up with the new adc changes. \nif you get stunned in a fight its basically game over before the stun ends now. That wasn't the case pre-preseason.\n\nHowever i see that GhostCrawler has clearly stated that there will be nothing done about lee or jinx etc. and being just a lowly player there is nothing i can do to convince him and his team so i might as well give it a rest now.\n\nPS.\ni know its not your department and i shouldn't be raging to you about these things that you have no control over but its so frustrating and boring in game now that i needed to tell someone of our frustration.\n\nI'm sorry :(\n\nand on a different note, that teaser looked epic! i was told by a friend who is good with this stuff that if you download the video you get a notepad which references Sona Garen Vi and Zed, so that just mystifies the circumstances even more.

For a lot of players its about the champions story, their play style and their theme.\n\nSure we can keep nerfing Vayne and Lee until players stop playing them, should we keep reducing their numbers until they have 45% win rate? 40% win rate? That seems extremely unfair on Vayne and Lee players who already have sub 50% win rate (maybe 48% is not bad but still do we want to keep pushing it lower by reducing their numbers (power)?)\n\nMaybe we should dilute the champions identity so they aren't as cool....but that seems like a lame move. \n\n> \"It isn't our intent to make Jinx less popular.

Once again this doesn't mean every champion will have the same play percentage/pick rate. What if there are more players in our playerbase that enjoy being a kung fu master over a armored tank bear? What if there are more players in our playerbase that enjoy being a hunter in the night AD tumbling around than a pirate queen?\n\nOnce again, I do believe power is a factor when a player decides to play a certain champion. But from my experience play-style/mechanics have a bigger impact I.e. How fun are the champions to play?.\n\nI want to play zed, vayne, lee because they are fun to play (even though I suck at them).\n\nWhat do Vayne, Lee and Thresh all have in common aside from being the top played champ in their role?\nThey all have deep mechanics and potential for cool plays! (they all have sub 50% win rate)\nYou've seen doublelifts vayne\nYou've heard of the insec play from Lee\nYou've yelled Madlife when Thresh lands a sick hook or makes a play with latern/flay\n\nWhat I don't want us to do is make these champions less fun to play. What I don't want us to do is make their abilities less interesting.\n\nI would much prefer we made other champions just as fun to play in their own unique way. But in my opinion at the end of the day imagine if every champion was 50% win rate, imagine if every champion fulfilled their fantasy in a fun and unique way through gameplay. In this perfect world of LoL what happens if more people like being a badass ninja than a badass fire mage? What happens if more people want to be the reaper of death vs tidal wave powered mermaid?\n\nRemember \"The way I define diversity is that you should be able to play who you want without raw power unduly influencing your decision (or your team thinking you are trolling), and you shouldn't see the same champs every game on your team or the other team.

Imagine the pro's at worlds having to waste a ban because of that.) what about if he had a 99% pick rate? would you still rework him? what about 98%? or 97%? at what percentage pick rate would you go from having to change him to not having to change him? there will be a number and its obviously between 34.32% and 100%\n\nso we need to ask ourselves how far off is Lee-sin from reaching that magic number? \nas it stands he is in 1/3 of all games, 1 game in every 3 will have a lee-sin in it, which isn't 'every' game but is pretty close to it.\n\n\nReworking 127 champs in order to bring down Lee's popularity doesn't seem like the most practical solution.\nit was a month between the marksman updates and Poppy, (and thats short comparing the time between Sion and the marksman ones) but lets take a month as a standard unit of measurement between re-works, it will take 127 months in total to update all the champions except lee, which equates to 10 and a half years, (way over the length of time the game has existed for) to bring all the other champions up to close the pick rate gap between them and Lee, and of course not all champion updates increase the pick rate, look at sion, and look at poppy's rapidly dropping pick rate now the hype is over, which shows that you'll need to update them both again if updating the champs is your only option of bringing lee's pick rate down.\n\nAnd you said yourself that players still might prefer being a kung fu monk to other champions.\nso i think that reworking the champions isn't quite a solution.\n\nand I'm not saying that Lee should have an equal pick rate as urgot or anything i know he will always be popular, but being 35% when most champs are 10%ish is a bit excessive.\n\nSo it all comes down to this really:\nDoes RIOT see the lack of variety diversity (needing to waste a ban etc etc) caused by 30%+ pick rates to be a problem?\n\nif Yes, then whats going to happen about it and when?\n\nagain i really don't want to sound against you or RIOT or anything (m really not, i love you guys and i support you on almost everything) and I'm sorry if i sound a little agro on some of these points, I'm really not i just don't know how to express the frustration of the monotony of champ select these days. :S thanks for baring with me tho, I'm sure its the last thing you want to deal with in your day :S","replies":[{"poster":"Maraudaur","date":"2015-12-28T11:04:24.297+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"No worries man. It's an interesting discussion.\n\nOnce again you are going to your main point of Lee is strong hence he is picked a lot. We must make him weaker to reduce his pick rate. You use Warwick as an example here, when he was really strong for a while (feral flare + Botrk + ult = instakill) I believe his win rate did jump significantly over 50%. The reason I bring this up is yes you can talk about how you think Lee is strong, but if he has a 48.2% win rate can you really say he is powerful? If Lee Sin players after 125+ games on him still manage a 49.61% win rate can you really say he is powerful?\n\nI agree theme isn't one of the strongest factors for pick rate. That's why in my TL:DR I mentioned mechanics. I think Mechanics/Play style plays into it a lot more than power or theme (they are all slightly related in a way though).\n\nLike I said in my huge wall of text above, What I don't want us to do is make these champions less fun to play. What I don't want us to do is make their abilities less interesting.\n\nLets use your hypothetical as an example, we made the perfect champion in terms of balance and fun. So fun that hes picked as jungler every single game. That would be a massive breakthrough in champion/character design. You talk about \n> \"Reworking 127 champs in order to bring down Lee's popularity doesn't seem like the most practical solution.\"\n\nOf course that doesn't sound practical. But if we made a super fun champion, why would we rework him to be less fun? Why would we not rework a different champion that is less fun to be more fun?\n\ne.g. \nScenario 1\n1) Lee goes from 100% pick rate to 90% pick rate. Volibear comes in at 10% pick rate?\n2) Lee goes from 90% pick rate to 80 % pick rate. Volibear, Trundle comes in at 10% pick rate each?\n3) so on and so forth\n\nScenario 2\n1) Lee goes from 100% pick rate to 50% pick rate. Volibear comes in at 50% pick rate?\n2) Lee goes from 50% pick rate to 33 % pick rate. Volibear, Trundle comes in at 33% pick rate each?\n3) so on and so forth\n\nThere are many different scenarios and I don't think we expect to make 127 champions all 0.79% pick rate each, and I know that's not what you are demanding.\n\nLook at top lane and mid lane right now, no one exceeds 20% pick rate and most champions are within 3% pick rate of the one above them in popularity. Both mid lane and top lane used to be much worse but with the juggernauts patch and the AP items rework it has helped to alleviate the issues.\n\nMid Lane\nhttp://i.imgur.com/ixtK3Ik.png\nTop Lane\nhttp://i.imgur.com/yXPfM2D.png\n\nMy main point is from a philosophical stand point if a champion is fun to play we don't want to make him less fun.

For example; a while back i got a score of 44/7/16 with karthus, which is doing quite well, but we still lost the game in the end. so power doesn't always equate to a win.\nIf a Yi had the same score, we probably would have won because Yi has more objective pushing potential than Karthus. \nwhen all 9 other players are dead, a Yi can do a lot more than a karthus can. It doesnt mean Karthus is less powerful than Yi but it does make Yi slightly more likely to win a game in those circumstances.\n\nA good comparison is Lee-Sin vs Rek'Sai, rek has a slightly higher win rate than Lee yet does worse in game, on average she has less kills than lee, more deaths, less assists, takes less turrets, and deals less damage overall. She still wins more games than lee though, which shows that Lee is more likely to do well in a game even if he doesn't necessarily win it.\nwhich is why people play him, because they know that with his extensive kit they can do well with him. \n\nI get that its not fair to reduce the 'fun' of a champion just to lower their pick rate, but there has to be something else that can be done, no one can argue that Azir isn't a fun champ to play, the insane jukes and plays you can make by moving a soldier while dashing to it are awesome, his ultimate is hilarious when a Lee or Yi or someone thinks they can kill you and then suddenly find themselves blocked in under your turret. Yet because he is harder to play than Lee, fewer people play him, fun for most people is directly related to how easy a champ is to play.\nLook at Syndra, Zyra, Azir, Urgot, Fiddlesticks, Karthus, All those champs are extremely fun to play and have awesome and surprising kits, but because they require a bit of brain work no-one picks them, look then at Jax, Garen, Katarina, Miss Fortune, Lux, those champs are boring in comparison, and (apart from katarina), they all either just stand there and spam things at you or charge blindly at you, none of which is much fun, but they do get results for minimal effort and thats what people want, as shown by their pick rate.\nSo if you want to update champs to make them more 'fun' for the general populace you're going to have to make them braindead to play, look at sion, even after his update he is hardly seen in game and he is infinitely more fun than he used to be. its not so easy to say \"oh well we will just update other champs to be as fun as lee\" because as shown from history, it doesn't work that easily.\n\nAll i want is to not be fighting the same champs every 2nd or 3rd game. \n\ni understand that we cant make lee less fun, but we also cant wait around for all the other champs to catch up because who knows how long that will take IF it happens.\n\ncant we just make adjustments to lee like say buff his damage, but give him mana, that way he still can make awesome flash ult plays and diving in to steal baron and ward hopping out again, but it just means he cant do it for the whole length of the fight, none of his kit has changed, he is still a kung fu fighting badass but is a little less sustainable.\n\nthe way i see champion balance is like taking a picture. In photography you have 3 basic settings: Aperture, Shutter speed, and ISO. Aperture decides how much light you want to let into the camera, Shutter speed decides how long you let light into the camera for, and ISO decides how sensitive the camera is to light.\n\nBy letting less light in with the aperture, you get more things in focus but you also let less light into the camera so the picture becomes darker. To lighten it up again you need to let the light in for longer with the shutter speed, however that increases the length of time needed to take the picture which means if you move the camera in that time, it gets all blurred, you can then increase the ISO which means the camera is more sensitive to light which means that you don't need to have a long shutter speed, but the higher the ISO the less quality the picture has.\n\nits a triangle and each point has advantages and tradeoffs and the picture can be made up of any combinations of the 3. but you cant have 100% of all 3\n\nthe same is true (at least from my inexperienced view) for champion design, on one point of the triangle you have Raw numbers (Damage) on the another point you have durability, and on the 3rd point you have power from the Kit (CC, dashes, heals, etc.)\n\nsomeone like Garen has large numbers (damage) and high durability, but his trade off is in his kit, he doesnt have very exiting abilities, no major CC, no life saving/killsecuring dashes etc. \n\nsomeone like Azir, has high numbers and high Kit power, but his trade off comes in his durability. \n\nSomeone like the new Poppy has decent damage, decent durability and decent kit power, so she has a bit of everything and can hold her own in most scenario's, but will never reach MF damage or Rammus durability, or Nami's  Kit power and thats her trade off. \n\n(i have illustrated these diagrams here)\nhttp://imgur.com/T4Pwzwz\n\neverything is a compromise and when the numbers creep up, something somewhere else has to go down in order to keep a champ balanced. \n\nnumbers (damage) is probably the easiest to measure and adjust, where as Kit power is much harder, how much damage is a Dash worth? how much tankiness is a stun worth as a trade off? \n\nit is my opinion that is where most balance problems occur, it is hard to know how much damage to give someone to compensate after you remove their stun. Or how much tankiness to take away now that the cooldown on their dash has decreased.\n\nand now we come to the point of this very long and probably pointless paragraph that began with photography, my point is, it must still be possible for Lee (just as an example) to be changed so that he is no more or less powerful, but move his power around, by giving him more damage but reducing his kit power by giving him mana, or in reverse, reduce the cool downs on his abilities but make him more squishy. It wouldn't make him any less fun to play but would move his power around a bit so he wouldn't always be the instant go-to champ for jungling every second game.\n\nI know that we cant make him less fun (and i don't want anyone to be less fun) but i do want there to be more variety in the champions selected in the near future. i know its not easy at all! but the pre-season is the time for experimenting with changes.\n\nI just want to see more variety back in the game. and i think waiting for other champs to catch up is going to take too long and not be as effective, Kog'Maw now breaks the AS barrier. but now even just weeks after his update he still isn't picked for games.\n\ni will admit to not being anywhere near as qualified as you guys, and i know that the RIOT teams will have thought of every possible angle and will be taking the best one.

I am only looking at champion.gg at the moment but if you has a source that says differently I would love to see.\n\nFrom champion.gg\n\n|                   | Lee    | Rek    |\n|-------------------|--------|--------|\n| Win rate          | 48.2%  | 47.86% |\n| Pick rate         | 34.32% | 3.74%  |\n| Gold earned       | 11636  | 11403  |\n| Kills             | 7.19   | 5.57   |\n| Deaths            | 6.22   | 5.23   |\n| Assists           | 9.05   | 9.57   |\n| Damage Dealt      | 15300  | 13930  |\n| damage taken      | 28644  | 33401  |\n| Team jungle CS    | 54.8   | 59.99  |\n| Counter jungle CS | 9.39   | 10.73  |\n\nI don't have turrets taken numbers (would love to see the source on yours) but from what I see reksai has less deaths and more assists overall. She also has a lower win rate.\n\nI like your triangle and I would like to relate it to Reksai and Lee\n\nI think Lee sin naturally is like Azir he has damage and kit power naturally. Lee can then augment this with items to push the power (burst) or durability (tank). Similar to how Azir can augment the triangle into kite mage (a little bit more of durbility damage and kit power i.e. rylais) or he can build ALL AP and really push the damage.\n\nRek'Sai in my opinion, is similar once again to azir but has lower \"damage\" and slightly more \"durability\". Once again this can be augmented with items either towards damage or durability.\n\nI guess my main questions to you is, how do you determine a kits power?\n\nLee sin has a high skill cap (he is hard to play well) and has to go into melee to out put damage. He is susceptible to CC and can easily be burst down. But he does have mobility and damage (burst) in his kit.\n\nReksai on the other hand has less burst potential but more sustained damage. She has extremely high map mobility with ult and tunnels and a mini malphite ult if you combo tunnel into unborrow. Reksai brings split push potential, map pressure AND objective control (through tremor sense).\n\nHow do we compare these two vastly different champions kits? how do we know which kit is more powerful and which is less powerful?","replies":[{"poster":"Lord Sesshomaru","date":"2015-12-29T03:34:45.679+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Im enjoying it too, I'm coming round to your view more and more now and see where i have been going wrong. \n\nBtw this post may seem long but its 60% lists and not just a wall of words.\n\nI got my statistics from 3 different places (perhaps that is how the problem occurred) \ni used lolking for pick/winrates\nleagueofgraphs for all other stats except turrets taken \nand turrets taken from elophant\n\nalthough on leagueofgraphs lee-sin's damage dealt was diefinetly 14,000 this morning and now its 15,000 so it must have updated since them but i swear my stats were accurate to my post this morning from that site!\nand her win rate is definitely higher on lolking as 47.6% (Lee sin) and 48% Rek'Sai)\nperhaps ill use that site you mentioned from now on, if you as a rioter trust it then thats reason enough for me!\n\nI agree with what you say about Lee and Azir their kits are similar in terms of usefulness of abilities etc. \n\nIn answer to your question about how i would determine a kits power, that is a difficult one because like i said it is the hardest one to measure, but i would determine it by taking away all the numbers (damage value, heal value, shield value etc) and looking at what exactly it is you have there.\ni would compare Riven and Annie as an example, \n\nRiven has:\n3 skillshot dashes (one of which can jump terrain), \n1 skillshot dash, \na shield, \nan auto attack enhancer, \nan aoe stun, \nan execute, \nan ability/auto attack range/damage enhancer, \nand no mana.\n\nwhere Annie's Kit has\na stun (either targetable or AoE),\na stat enhancer/thornmail,\nand a controllable pet.\n\nSo i would argue that Riven's Kit is stronger than Annie's \nbut thats only without the numbers once you add in the numbers (again our triangle) their power evens out again.\nbut if Annie's abilities had Riven's damage i feel that she would be rather underwhelming, and if riven's abilities had Annie's damage then she would be rather OP. so i would conclude that riven has a stronger kit. (at least as far as fighting is concerned)\n\nBut I couldn't tell you how much each of Riven's attributes is worth in damage, e.g. if you were to take away her stun, how much extra damage would she need to have on her other abilities in order to not lose or gain any power, as I'm a lowly graphic designer and numbers/maths are not my strong point.\n\nAs for Rek'Sai and Lee\n\nLee has:\nNo mana,\nA skillshot dash,\na targetable dash,\na shield.\nlifesteal/spellvamp,\nan attack speed enhancer,\nAoE damage,\nAoe, true sight,\nAoE slow,\nA powerful Disengage/engage knock up, \nand no mana.\n\nRek'Sai has:\nA heal,\nan AoE AA enhancer,\nan AoE  true sight skillshot,\nan Aoe Knockup,\nTrue damage,\nA skillshot dash,\nan attack speed enhancer,\nglobal teleport substitute,\nTremor sense,\nand no mana.\n\nas far as number of things are concerned, Lee has more in his kit, but that doesn't necessarily make it better, it would have to be broken down further,\n\nThey both have attack speed enhancers, a skillshot dash, AoE true sight and damage, an aoe/multi target knock up, No mana, and some form of healing.\n\nnow we can take those out of the list and we are left with:\n\nLee:\na Disengage,\na slow,\na targetable dash,\na shield.\n\nRek:\nTeleport substitute,\nTrue damage,\ntremor sense.\n\nso we can conclude that Lee's kit is more powerful in a fight while Rek'Sai's puts more pressure on the map, so then we must go even deeper and look at how much of the game is spent In a fight of some sort vs how much of the game is spent split pushing. It also needs to be considered how powerful a won team fight is compared to a successful split push. Im afraid i cant take it any further because i don't know the stats on that, i would guess that there are more fights than split pushing, and that an ace is more valuable than a pushed lane while the other team is still alive, but i wouldn't quote myself on that as I'm just a lowly silver.\nit would be my opinion that Lee's Kit is stronger that Rek'Sai's Just like Riven's Kit has more potential than Annie's.\n\nanyway that is how i would look at it, (dunno if thats the right way to go about it or not but thats what makes the most sense to me) and unless experiments were done where you gave each champion exactly the same amount of damage and tankiness and then played games under these controlled conditions, you wouldn't know for certain whose kit was stronger. \n\n\nIm far from saying that lee is OP or broken or in need of a nerf, if his win rate is sub-50% then its probably the opposite, but regardless he has a 35% pick rate (for whatever reason) and that makes it rather boring in game, and i think its his kit thats has the most to do with that pick rate.","replies":[{"poster":"Maraudaur","date":"2015-12-29T05:44:06.479+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Regardless of the numbers it looks like you want to discuss the kit's more and exactly what they bring.\n\nFor Reksai though I feel like you are missing two key things\n* Her capability to regenerate while burrowed (if she has fury)\n* Her capability to have 8 tunnels up at once\n\nWhich imo gives reksai a more powerful \"kit\"\n\nI think team fighting and split pushing are both extremely powerful strategies in our game, both are equally effect but vastly different to execute.\n\nWhat does winning a team fight guarantee you? the ability to get objectives\nWhat does having split push potential guarantee you? the ability to get objectives\n\nI don't think one strategy is better than the other.\n\nMy main question for you is what constitutes a good kit?\nJust because we overload a champion with lots of passive and secondary actives doesn't mean its a good kit does it?\n\nHere is the main disagreement between us. I agree Lee Sin/Vayne/Thresh have high pick rates due to their kit. But it's not because their kit is \"better\" or \"stronger\" than other champions. \n\nI define a kits strength by the opportunities it gives a player to win a game, because ultimately in my mind a that is what \"power\" means in this game.\n\nIt's actually that their kit is extremely fun to play.\nLee sin's kit does a great job of making you feel like a kung fu master\nVayne's kit does a great job of making you feel like a hunter in the night\nThresh's kit does a great job of making you feel like a reaper of sorts\n\nIn saying that I think Rek'sai's kit does a great job of feeling like a void burrower, I think Annie's kit does an okay job for being that prodigal fire mage/creepy girl (although keep in mind she is meant to be a beginner champion).\n\nRiven feels like a cool sword \"fighter\", Yasuo feels like a smooth samurai thanks to their kit.\n\nWe want to bring up other champions to that level where their kit makes it so when you play as the champion you really feel the identity of that champion. Jinx is a great example. When you play as jinx you feel like a maniac who likes to shoot, thats why shes popular.\n\nI don't think Lee's kit is powerful, I think its balanced but extremely well executed. I don't think we should remove the feeling players get when they play as Lee. What I think we should do is bring up other champions and make them engaging and fun to play as well. Look at what we did with the Marksman rework (i know vayne is still 30+%). We managed to make Caitlyn feel more like a sniper, we made Corki more like that AP/AD marksmen, we made Kogmaw **THE** artillery marksman, and awhile ago we defined tristana as the go to seige marksman. While these haven't completely solved the issue they have definitely given each champion more defined identities and brought up their popularity.\n\nThink about the changes we've done to juggernauts, I remember before that top lane had a holy Trinity (forget who exactly but it was like Mundo, Renekton and someone else). Now top lane is very even with all kinds of picks.\n\nI guess what I'm trying to say is 2 things\n\n1) I truly believe Lee/Vayne/Thresh's kits are not more \"powerful\" than other champions. I believe they are better designed to make you feel like the champion and help define the champions identity.\n\n2) I don't believe we need to touch up ALL champions to reduce Lee's pick rate. We only need to look at the junglers. We don't need to look at ALL 127 champions just maybe 46 jungle champs and even then we don't need to work on all 46 we can start with 5-10 like juggernauts, like marksman.\n\nWhats your summoner name by the way?","replies":[{"poster":"Lord Sesshomaru","date":"2015-12-29T07:57:22.157+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"First i just want to say that I'm deeply sorry for my rudeness to you in my very first comment, it was a pretty bad day by any unit of measurement (not lol related tho) and it wasn't fair for me to be so snappy I'm not usually that way.\n\nYes my mistake i did forget how long the tunnels lasted, and yea her regeneration is nothing to scoff at, i remember being really exited at that mechanic when she was teased.\n\nnow that we include those two things, she probably does surpass Lee in terms of power in kit.\n\nyou are right about what you say in the aspects of team fighting and split pushing, neither is more powerful than the other.\n\nYes Lee's 'power' has been our main disagreement, but your last few comments have made me re-think it somewhat, and i do now think i might share your opinion on that, \nas for what constitutes a good kit i cant really give a good answer on that, but i am of the belief that mechanics are more powerful than raw numbers, i avidly believe that the most powerful part of Zed's ultimate is the ability to swap back to his R shadow regardless of distance, and not the actual mark itself. That Ability to swap back has saved more Zed's from 1v5 certain death than i can count, and i think abilities like that are absolutely amazing! (even if a little frustrating for me who is usually on the receiving end xD) \n\nI do think that 'disrupter' kits are quite strong Thresh and Riven are good examples of a 'disrupter', two or more Hard CC moves (especially if they are AoE and non-ultimate), that just cause mayhem during team fights, a good thresh makes Katarina basically useless in fights and i think that style of kit has extreme potential, I'm not saying its any more or less powerful than other kits, but i do think it has a powerful potential.\n\nI think you are absolutely right when you talk about how a kit makes a champion feel like that champion, Yasuo is a perfect example like you say, the honourable precise sword thrusts and taming the 'noble' element of wind.\n\nZed feels like a ninja, zipping from shadow to shadow.\n\nwhenever i play him (and yes i am guilty of playing Lee-Sin xD) you do really feel like Kwai-Chang Caine (Grasshopper).\n\nTwisted fate has that element of chance with his pick a card, but you also know the order of the cards as they cycle just like a card cheat.\n\nAzir (my very fave) feels like the emperor that he is, commanding the remains of his fallen empire with the pride as if it was still in its glory days.\n\nI cant congratulate you guys enough for doing that so well.\n\nand perhaps this is were i went wrong! i may have been confusing this feeling of Lee's kit being like a kung fu master with the thought of 'powerful kit' instead of seeing it for what it truly is.\nwhich kind of makes my entire discussion irrelevant really... xD oh well\n\nWhile i do think the marksman update wasn't as successful as hoped in terms of adding pick rate diversity back into the game, it did a fantastic job in separating out the ADC's. Before the marksman update i personally felt that all ADC's were essentially the same champion that just did slightly different things. but now it is clear that caitlin is indeed the sniper, kog maw is the 'hit them with a wall of bullets' artillery champ, Graves doesn't play 'like' he is a shotgunner anymore he ACTUALLY is a shotgunner, and Quinns new ult is perfect.\n\nI do get now what you say about Lee and Vayne not being more powerful than other champs but are more successful at feeling like the character (which is after all why we play games, so we can stop being the silly uni student and start being the Emperor of the sands!)\n\nand yes you're right that not all the champs need to be updated, updating bard or Nami is gong to have absolutely no effect on Lee whatsoever. I do think that its a big ask to wait for the junglers to be updated in order for the pick rates to come down, but after our discussion i don't think there is any other clear and fair way to do it. \n\n(also while on the subject, congrats to riot on bard btw, there is no other champ in the game that makes you feel as light hearted and happy and without a care in the world as bard!)\n\nAlso my Summoner name is Itachi Uchiha \n(dont judge me on my losing streak haha xD I've just been on a massive massive winning streak and the mmr has caught up with me now :p haha plus i played rather badly too xD)","replies":[{"poster":"Maraudaur","date":"2015-12-29T08:52:06.702+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'm glad this discussion was very productive.
