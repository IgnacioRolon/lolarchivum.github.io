I can understand lane pressure, harassing, counter-picking and focusing him down in team-fights if you can will stop him 2-shotting your carry, but his damage is insane for how safe he is all game, he has a massive slow that stops almost all gap closers except Akali and I also understand AP shoud be able to melt him, but there are very few AP that can successfully burst him down in team fights safely, he has a clutch Heal mechanic on his ultimate (essentially) and all in all I literally can't deal with him.\n\nI've been stomped by Vi's, Fed Fiora's, Teemo's controlling the map. I can deal with a 20-0 Ashe, she can make mistakes and be shut down. Nasus is almost impossible to shut down and even then he just walks back into lane, thankful for the free teleport to his top minion wave.\n\nGonna start playing backdoor Yi again, reals.\n\nThis is like Nasus and his team lategame if he has even 100 stacks in a team-fight - his team just ride him for glory:","replies":[{"poster":"Talon12","date":"2015-03-25T02:35:41.725+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Build thornmail problem solved. He will take 30% damage back Before your armor is applied, and as you said they don't really tend to build too much magic resist so that's about 27% of his q total damage back as true damage.

Don't let him simply farm, if he does, punish the rest of his team.\n5. For those who can stand building a BotRK, Banshee or Qss on your team, build it.\n\nAnd Nasus isn't a tank, he is a fighter.","replies":[{"poster":"Jink","date":"2015-03-24T14:19:48.836+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"\"With just Warden's Mail and Glacial Shroud he's tank\"","replies":[{"poster":"Talon12","date":"2015-03-25T02:39:51.857+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=KiStorm,realm=OCE,application-id=Ntey9fRZ,discussion-id=UvzRihit,comment-id=00000000,timestamp=2015-03-24T14:19:48.836+0000)\n>\n> \"With just Warden's Mail and Glacial Shroud he's tank\"\n\n\nTanky, tanky.

He shouldn't be able to just waltz through your team to them. Positioning and peel is paramount in team fights. To be honest, Hecarim is. Much bigger threat because he can just charge straight through your team to the carries but Nasus can be CC'd to death. \n\nYes I understand you are in Bronze and co-ordination and game knowledge aren't exactly high but these are things you need to work on if you want to climb.","replies":[{"poster":"Jink","date":"2015-03-24T23:58:37.625+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Talking about team comps where they have wave push and even engaging under our own turrets his Q's are devastating and there's nothing you can do about it, aside from /ff.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Yuriklatura","date":"2015-03-24T22:54:23.514+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Nasus is my boi. If you know you are against a Nasus, go top lqne vayne or anyone ranged with an escape or loads of cc. Swain works well against him early, even once he gets a ton of stacks he still can't get to you. But a quick Spirit Visage will nullify your damage. Try to play a top laner and have a jungle with differing damage types to punch through. \n\nI stomp anyone who needs time to scale. A quick Frozen Heart nullifies the damage pof AD champions and will allow him to farm even faster. You need to tell your jungler to stop that happening. \n\nTBH, I think Nasus needs a nerf to his early game with a buff to his late game.","replies":[{"poster":"Jink","date":"2015-03-24T23:04:19.790+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yeah I agree lol it's around early mid-mid game when/if his 1st turret is down he becomes problematic to push out of lane or bully or kill and there's very little you can do about him even if you are winning teamfights and objectives then he gets a few stacks and comes n 2 shots a carry.\n\nMaybe it's Bronze ELO but I have problems dealing with him consistently; even in normals.\n\nIf I top lane, I can deal with him 9 times out of ten.\n\nMaybe I should just face the fact it's unco-ordinated games where he stomps - its just annoying to be winning really hard and lose because you can't stop him from gaining stacks and he turns the game around almost unstoppably but hey maybe that's life.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"hðnkƒørÇªmíllè","date":"2015-03-24T12:57:20.721+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"LoL nasus is pretty easy to peel off, unless he is insanely fed.\nJust play a decent adc, whether ir be vayne/dash adc, build bork, last whisper and qs and watch poor doge whimper as he cant touch you.","replies":[{"poster":"TouchMyKimchi","date":"2015-03-24T14:31:31.880+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Ye.\n\nI've seen many decent Vaynes totally rekt poor Doge.","replies":[]}]}]}
