Yay 3.6 seconds I will channel for 1-2 seconds after slowing you then knock you up for 1-2 seconds then start channeling again after 1 second.\n\nWow that is literally the most expensive thing Riot has ever done.\n\nWorst thing since release Diana 2 shot me with 2 Doran&#039;s rings or Karma melted me in 2 seconds from 2K HP to - 0 in 3 seconds with Muramana.\n\nIf you stun him it goes on like 2 second cooldown and its like 600 range.\n\nCould not think of worse BS to have to deal with late game.","replies":[{"poster":"Zorphiax","date":"2015-06-29T06:29:42.407+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"there is...\nkinda...\nZac's e with maxed with 40% cd","replies":[]},{"poster":"csm","date":"2015-06-27T07:56:31.314+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It's very hard to walk out of the area that is clearly present.

Yeah he has E but I believe it took a bat last time if I am not wrong so there's that too.\n\nI don't think he is OP or like broken, since if anything he should be a model example for any bruiser characters (well not entirely but you get the point) that are coming in the future and I'm not kidding because he's that well designed imo.","replies":[]},{"poster":"LUPIN lll","date":"2015-06-27T08:33:25.160+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"HALP SION IS OOOOOP PLEASAA HAALP RIHT NAAAAAAAAAwwwwwWW  RIIIIIIIIITOOOO I CAANNNNNNNTTTTTTTTTTTTTT DDDDOGE THE Q QQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQ","replies":[]}]}
