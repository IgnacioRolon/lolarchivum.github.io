If you can prove otherwise, I'd love to hear your in-depth explanation of how the money just appears in their vaults.\n\nLOL yes they do. big hint: when banks loan people money, they don't reach into their own pockets.  Knowing that most money in circulation exists not as cash or coins but as bank deposits may also help you understand how it works.\n\n\nPerson A deposits $100 in the bank.\n\nThe bank keeps $10 in it's reserve (If you don't know what reserve is, generally depositors don't withdraw more than 10% of the money they have deposited on a given day. this is the amount banks have to keep reserved).\n\nThe bank then lends person B $90 at interest.\n\nPerson B deposits the $90 in the bank.\n\nThe bank keeps $9 in reserve.\n\nThe bank then lends person C $81 at interest.\n\nBOOM there is now a total of $271 in 3 accounts that can be spent. All from the original $100 deposit. $171 has been created \"out of thin air\". Here the bank has created credit and simultaneously created deposits in those people's accounts which for all intents and purposes is MONEY.\n\nThe bank then makes interest from these various loans.\n\nLike i mentioned at the start, pretty much all money is in the form of bank deposits, so this is a never ending cycle.\n\nThis is a really simple example easily found using google but this is essentially one of the first things you learn in macroeconomics at uni.","replies":[{"poster":"KLofM","date":"2015-10-01T13:06:42.289+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Having finished an economics degree, I get what you're playing at here.\n\nI also know that first year macro didn't count for anything by the end. Admittedly, I was more... econometrics than macroeconomics. I'm gonna assume we have a 3 person economy plus a bank. In reality it's a bit more complicated obviously.\n\nAs a rule, in order to replicate what you mentioned, Person A will take out 10% after B has repaid, and will take the rest after Person C simply because why not, though we could go to Person Z23.\n\nA deposits $100. Bank allocates $90 to available loans and $10 to reserve.\nBank loans B $90, get's repaid $90+interest, A withdraws $10 leaving them with $90 in their bank account.\nBank has $90 + interest. Bank commits $9 to reserve and loans C $81 (let's say Bank retains interest from previous loans and does not reinvest - not that it matters here, all it does it make them more money)\nC repays $81 + interest, A withdraws $9.\nA then withdraws the rest (because why not).\n\nWith that original $100 you make say 20 bucks interest or whatever for the bank. But you also get an additional $171 of value out of this money. Which is where your $271 number comes from, because you have the original earning of that $100, as well as the $171 dollars of value that money facilitates. But that money isn't just out of thin air. It's just taking that initial deposit and making it do stuff for other people or businesses. Those other people still have to repay the money plus interest (which is basically a convenience fee), which keeps everything reasonably balanced so long as Person A can get their money back. If they can't because Person C can't cough up, then everything turns to rubbish (see the 2008 market crashes in the USA about that one, where so many people were unable to repay home loans in the US because banks gave money out to everyone that all of a sudden there was.... no money!)\n\n\n**Issues with Printing Money**\n\nThe original issue of printing money was because paper and coin currency was weighted to gold. Therefore if you wanted to print more currency, you needed to buy more gold, or your currency was going to depreciate because gold had an approved value (hence why old coins tend to have particular weights). Post WW1 Germany used this if I remember correctly to repay their war debts to the WW1 Allies. However, this meant that the cost of imported goods also increased a large amount in Germany, which led to the prices of things like bread increasing like crazy simply because the cost of the base materials  to produce everything increased. It ended up leading to depression because German wages couldn't keep up  with the pace of inflation (obviously because all this printed money was going straight overseas), and this as well as other scenes during the Great Depression are generally why printing money to solve problems is frowned upon. \n\nThese days, the value of currency is generally based on other currencies since the weighting against the gold standard was done away post WW2. Printing money makes a dollar of your money worth less to others simply because exchange rates are based on how valued currencies are against each other, and this is regulated by many international agreements. Make more of one currency, and it becomes worth less to the others because you end up supplying more money than what is demanded (currency deflation). A more modern example of problems caused due to printing money and inflation would be Zimbabwe (I believe this fits the case, it might not, but I'm sure any economics student at some point has joked about Zimbabwe's economy).\n\nIt was also a contributing factor as to  why down here in OCE for quite some time in recent years we enjoyed good importing conditions with the US, because they were printing currency where NZ and AUS were not to quite the same extent if at all (this has of course reversed this year due to a slackening of demand of both the AUD and NZD because of conditions in China and Europe as everyone looks for safer currencies I'm guessing).\n\nBut most importantly, the value of money comes from the fact that at any one time, there is a finite amount of money. By printing more, you make what exists worth less - and that applies to most things that are material in life. All of economics is based on the idea that the more of a resource there is, the less it's worth because of scarcity. If a country prints lots of money, then it will make it worth less to another country, and so they will demand more in exchange for goods because they value each dollar far lower than what they did. Doubling the amount of money in circulation is only going to see the cost of everything double because everyone will think \"Ooo more money, I'd be willing to spend more on these things\". And then you give away that money you just created. So not only do you have the original amount of money in your own economy, but you've doubled your own prices (roughly) because of consumer expectations that they're going to get this money and be able to use it, and given a whole bunch of money to another country and massively expanded the amount of money in their own economy, which will only see prices increase there because of the precise same ideas.\n\nLike, we do that individually as it is. We get a pay rise, say from 500 bucks a week to 700 bucks a week and all of a sudden we're willing to spend 25 dollars on a box of beer instead of 18 because the amount of money in our personal economies has increased and so the value of a dollar is worth less because instead of 500 of them.... you have 700!\n\n\n**A Point on Donations**\n\nNow coming to another point, what about people who donate billions of dollars to other countries? Well to the host country, there is usually a small effect because all this money that could have been spent in that economy (like that billion dollars could have been in a bank for a bank to loan out, has left the system. But to the country that money is being donated to, the effect would be massive (assuming that the country has a small economy) and if not managed correctly (say this billion dollars was allowed to enter the economy all at once) would just be destructive because how do you ensure that the money is fairly distributed? There is a reason why billionaires tend to donate to charities and trusts that work in Africa and such, because these charities won't use the money all at once, but slowly drip feed it into the economy in a targeted manner (or at least they should) in order to allow the impact to be predictable, small/localised and spread out over a period of time that allows the economy to adjust.\n\nOf course, my degree wasn't in macroeconomics, so I'm sure that a macroeconomics masters will come along and rip me apart or something, but that was how I understood the whole \"why can't we print money?\" problem. It's a nice idea, but it just historically only causes suffering for people.","replies":[{"poster":"orfiction","date":"2015-10-01T15:06:00.866+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"***","replies":[{"poster":"Jink","date":"2015-10-01T16:39:03.205+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Lol It's gonna get so messy if people don't pull their heads out and help these people.\n\nWhy would you donate to Charity when the government prints money?\n\nThey print: Money.\n\nYou're giving people that want to help them: Money.\n\nAre you f*cking insane?\n\nYou're devaluing our economy to help them - while the government refuses to make a substantial effort because it devalues our economy.\n\nHelping them devalues their economy?\n\nGood.

Although the creator of the topic may not actually have any interest in replies, I think it might help those who stumble across the topic if you provide explanations. I can understand your point that creating money is different from donating money, it could be fleshed out though.\n\nThank you. You are correct in that yes, it could be expanded on because in reality, economics is really much more complicated than what I've reflected on. I might touch on it again tomorrow but really, if people are really interested they should take an afternoon or something and find a scholarly piece or two on the subject because it would explain it all much much better than I ever could.\n\nAlternatively someone with a masters in Macroeconomics could show their face and give us a lecture. :P\n\nThe issue with explaining why logic is faulty as opposed to simply calling it out in economics is that economics is such a politically charged but also ideological diverse subject (it's about far more than just money). Logic that appears faulty to some, makes absolute sense to others in the economics field. Logic that makes sense now is going to eventually seem completely faulty to people in the future. Same goes for a lot of fields really. But it's very difficult to even reach a middle point because people are VERY firm in their standpoints and it's very difficult to actually prove why certain economic logic is faulty. \n\nThe whole \"printing money for Africa\" logic is deemed faulty not because we've ever done it (as far as I know, but I suppose Zimbabwe serves as a negative example) and so have actual proof that it will not work, but because the very idea of it just seems so radical that it \"makes no sense and cannot possibly work\". And the thing is, as much as we would all like to try, the perceived risks of such an economic experiment are so large, and the memories of the Great Depression and other economic crises are so imprinted on economic doctrine that the moment someone suggests it, we're all going crazy about it which let's face it, this thread is proof of that, one person mentions an idea which is quite adventurous, and everyone else is like (including myself) \"EEEEEKKKK\". I get where he comes from, I can see a situation in which a mass donation that gets directly injected into the economy works (where everyone gets a fair proportionate share of the money immediately). But we don't see it happening, and so for the likes of some of us, the whole thought is scary and shouldn't be touched with a stick.\n\n*shrugs*\n\nThat's economics for you.

Both are a development to me.","replies":[{"poster":"fattyhotdogs","date":"2015-10-01T08:57:38.766+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Go google \"why can't I print money\" and educate yourself","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]}
