You can play a tanky support and sacrifice yourself for your team, your stats look shit, but your team performs well and you win.\n\nYou can also have those games that  you have a perfect KDA and still lose, it is your attitude and how you play that determines the win or lose, not always the stats.\n\nIf I take one of my table champions in the jungle, top or mid I will very rarely lose in that role, but if I don't perform well enough to help my team I will end up losing more than winning. On the flip side, why should I sacrifice my game and how well I play in lane just to help my team who are failing hard?\n\nIt is a tough decision for Rito to allow the current form to continue, but one that is just as worrying by changing it to a personal stats based game.

Meaning, when you lose matches vs them, your MMR will decrease (along with your lp) and so you're vsing people that are way lower than your division, so that you gain less LP.

If you wanna stay stationary in GV you have to bring your mmr up to GV first.\n\nI know my match history (I was there). It's just stupid because I got clamped after like 20 games. It took like 40 to get here. I didn't smash my MMR that bad. I play with plats and stuff and it's annoying for them to carry games with newbies because they can only do so much. It's hard to carry Silvers sometimes but it's a bit stupid to clamp - in my opinion - near entry level MMR because you get people who have just started ranked and clamping around people just starting ranked is a joke; asking for problems.\n\nClamp high ELO players or something.\n\nAlso Silvers on the polar contradictive side of the scale aren't always that bad, I cam from Silver and beating them is now walk in the park.\n\n3:1 win/loss is asking for a walk in the park repeatedly.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Talon12","date":"2015-12-12T13:30:10.861+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"my mmr tanked when 6 games in a row bot a botlane that fed the enemy vayne so hard :/ now i dont get mmr for wins anymore. people should really listen when you try to get vayne banned, because people are too dumb to play safe if she gets ahead.","replies":[{"poster":"JasonWazza","date":"2015-12-12T13:36:01.111+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Funny how you say that but 50% of the games you lost from those 6, are with a vayne on YOUR team.","replies":[{"poster":"Talon12","date":"2015-12-12T13:38:25.544+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"look, just leave it at \"Vayne ruins the game every time, enemy always fed, ally always feeds\"\n\nand never said it was recently, was like 2 weeks ago","replies":[{"poster":"JasonWazza","date":"2015-12-12T13:45:14.510+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":">and never said it was recently, was like 2 weeks ago\n\n>my mmr tanked when 6 games in a row bot a botlane that fed the enemy vayne so hard\n\nConsidering you didn't have a 6 loss streak 2 weeks ago, i feel like your just making shit up to justify a flawed argument.\n\nYes i am an asshole.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"DarkenedKnight","date":"2015-12-12T10:54:23.979+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"What division is this? that'd suck big time!","replies":[{"poster":"Jink","date":"2015-12-12T11:01:45.550+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=DarkenedKnight,realm=OCE,application-id=Ntey9fRZ,discussion-id=Eb3FFLe6,comment-id=0002,timestamp=2015-12-12T10:54:23.979+0000)\n>\n> What division is this? that'd suck big time!\n\nGold 5.","replies":[{"poster":"JasonWazza","date":"2015-12-12T11:31:40.130+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"and you probably have a ~Silver 3 MMR according to what i can see as match history.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"JasonWazza","date":"2015-12-12T10:33:20.999+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"So why is your MMR so bad?","replies":[{"poster":"Jink","date":"2015-12-12T11:04:12.587+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=JasonWazza,realm=OCE,application-id=Ntey9fRZ,discussion-id=Eb3FFLe6,comment-id=0001,timestamp=2015-12-12T10:33:20.999+0000)\n>\n> So why is your MMR so bad?\n\nThat's besides the point dude, it's saying that a bad streak deserves punishing irreputably with an inescapable clamping that requires a 4:1 win ratio to climb.\n\nYou can't know if that streak is player based in a 5v5.\n\nFlat gains are smart.\n\nEducated systems are stupid, because they assume the system is correct in all manners otherwise errors snowball out of control, just like 1 problem at a nuclear reactor that does incredible things and works awesome means 500 people now have cancer. Great technology human race, now let's chuck the same epic science we've acquired into ratings! We could have flat gains, but no.\n\nYou're saying bad MMR means I am in the wrong, which is debatable but it's no excuse to clamp someone at the bottom of a division because they've lost games - to the point where they have to have a 4:1 win ratio because the system itself says it gives you ratings based on win/loss yet will give me 12 for a win, 12 for a win, take 24 for a loss then give me 11 for a win. It's a 50:50 reward system on average now with an expectation of 4:1 win/loss to climb, 3:1 to stay stationary and possible beat the clamping by climbing 1 LP at a time and that's a joke. Can't even begin to point out how stupid clamping is in general, but this kind of clamping is undebatably stupid.","replies":[{"poster":"JasonWazza","date":"2015-12-12T11:29:13.462+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Fact is your aim is to climb, then fix your MMR and then you will be able to climb, the system is saying you don't deserve to climb right now.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Jink","date":"2015-12-12T12:37:37.634+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"10/10 Rito gj get better please.\n\nClamp this anomaly harder pliz. {{sticker:slayer-jinx-catface}}","replies":[]},{"poster":"Jink","date":"2015-12-12T12:37:11.395+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Anomalies are things maths can't solve so they use more maths.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Jink","date":"2015-12-12T12:36:14.614+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"\"The maths is wrong, better use some better maths!\"\n\nWhy not use that maths in the first place.\n\n\"An anomaly arose, the maths was wrong\".\n\n\"Lets use the maths on anomalies to fix it\".\n\nSmart move, maths on anomalies.\n\nIntelligent.","replies":[]}]}
