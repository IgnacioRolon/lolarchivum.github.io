Unless eve is so terrible that she feeds constantly before level 10, she is one of the strongest flanker and punisher in the entire game. She forces opponents to spend more gold on pink wards, play extremely passively and conscious of pushing due to the possible flank. Her Q is on a very short cooldown and at early levels shreds the opponent's health. She is easily able to do more than 500 dmg with Q and AA alternation at level 3. However, late game is another matter. She falls behind due to defense, wards, grouping and hard CC. That being said, don't underestimate her. With {{item:3135}} and {{item:3151}} her damage is still quite high.","replies":[]},{"poster":"kJs","date":"2015-06-17T00:02:51.968+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"If you're the enemy top laner or Jungler you'd best pick {{champion:107}} Or {{champion:421}}.
