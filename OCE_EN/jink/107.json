Ezreals and Vayne will destroy you, Vayne especially.\nIgnite is actually more common than you might think, the support can take it over exhaust to prioritise early game kill secures.\n\nOne of the problems with AoE slows is that they're AoE, your adc might not like that in SoloQ. His gapclosing really isn't that great without Flash or Righteous Glory. Volibear is better in the Jungle if you want to use his CC because if he's always in lane, the enemy will see his Q+RG+Flash charge.\n\nOne of an ADC's strategy is to be the splitpusher. Volibear isn't that great with the likes of Wukong, Nasus, etc. He's far more useful as a tank.\n\nI think it's better to describe Volibear bot as a potential 'kill lane' partner, rather than a support. But then again, almost every other champion is great for kill lanes, Jarvan IV and Lee Sin do a far better job shutting down the enemy's bot lane as \"support\".","replies":[]}]}
