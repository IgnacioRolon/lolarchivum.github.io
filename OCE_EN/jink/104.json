Now most conflicts I face or see are for reasons, not bravado or showing off (although that still happens) - but when it comes to the internet every couple of days I see people abusing each other or me, or witness comments about people being downies, comments that they would beat the sh-t out of the other person if they knew where they lived and suggestions to go get cancer etc.\n\nI don't understand. Maybe it's just too easy to type this sh-t and not see the actual effect of your words (hatred) even from other people witnessing you abusing someone else and maybe they need to take time to think between their words or learn to mute people that antagonize or gain the ability to ignore people actively. Maybe it's self-esteem issues and they feel the need to defend themselves from people that are clearly not worth the energy or dignity of their words.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"TrashDonnut","date":"2015-04-01T05:02:17.367+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"This is what i always ask to people who abuse team.\n\nDerp: [All] OMG Support SO SHIT\n\nMe: [All] Will insults help them get better then?\n\n*Nobody talks for the whole game*","replies":[]},{"poster":"Sackboy","date":"2015-04-01T00:04:53.836+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":4,"body":"Abuse has to be right, if you come of as a twelvie then it will make them play worse as you're mad.","replies":[{"poster":"Zero Infinity","date":"2015-04-01T00:14:03.634+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"#playpositive","replies":[{"poster":"Sackboy","date":"2015-04-01T01:17:16.528+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":4,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Skyprus,realm=OCE,application-id=Ntey9fRZ,discussion-id=VIJfVUA4,comment-id=00010000,timestamp=2015-04-01T00:14:03.634+0000)\n>\n> #playpositive\n\nI'll play positive if your W/L ratio is positive.","replies":[{"poster":"Zero Infinity","date":"2015-04-01T01:24:47.095+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Rekt!\nI've slipped down to 45% winrate (35 -43) after a massive losing streak. \nAlthough you probably checked before posting. \n\nHowever I infer that you play only 5% negative as that is how negative I am in the W:L.\nI would prescribe the occasional \"sigh\", \"*eyeroll*\" or occasionally sarcastic comment when some says something you deem silly.","replies":[{"poster":"Unseen Predator","date":"2015-04-01T03:30:06.495+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I just went on a losing streak, still at 66% winrate though lol.","replies":[{"poster":"Zero Infinity","date":"2015-04-01T03:34:07.166+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Good job :)!","replies":[{"poster":"Unseen Predator","date":"2015-04-06T06:56:34.136+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Not really, i was like 78% before that losing streak :(","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Unseen Predator","date":"2015-04-01T02:46:14.341+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I have a 66% winrate, are you still going to give me shit if i don't play very well in the one game i have with you?
