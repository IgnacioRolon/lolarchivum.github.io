I ended up going a Liandry's with Zhonya's on Di because they had 2 tanks but I feel like buying HP is a bit detrimental because of his % missing HP magic damage and I don't like buying Tabi on AP's because I feel the need to cut through the enemy AD's Magic Resist.\n\nI just feel like he counters basically every AP mid laner except maybe leblanc and even then he can semi outplay you by being more useful in team fights etc.\n\nI also don't think win rates really point out his effectiveness because it's a team game, solo win rates don't really mean a lot to me. I mean I've won plenty a game by contributing very little and I think he basically gets an easy life in mid lane while AP's - even those with good counter mechanics (Di) miss out if they have to build defensively because he has a plethora of options to smash your defensive types IE he can easily get blade and armor pen and ignore most of your defense and health, while the most you can do is try to either attempt to defend against him or simply outburst him. I hate versing him and almost never smash them and even when I do he can lane sit rather safely regardless and catch up to some extent with farm and is useful all game basically no matter what I do.","replies":[{"poster":"ExiledBlade","date":"2015-08-10T13:24:11.574+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"{{champion:238}} is going to get an buff to his ult, \n\n    Death Mark (R) delay between reactivating Death Mark reduced to .5 from 1\nContempt for the Weak  {{champion:238}} basic attacks against targets below 50% Health deal 6-10% of the target's maximum Health as bonus Magic Damage if he auto attacks you. \nAlso my rates were Ranked 5's not solo Q,\nThink about taking {{summoner:3}} when your playing vs Ad mid laners.\nMages should ( {{champion:103}} {{champion:69}} {{champion:63}} {{champion:143}} ) clear the wave and look to roam bot, or counter gank.\n{{champion:134}} {{champion:112}} {{champion:7}} {{champion:105}} {{champion:84}}  Will have an better laning phase,\n\nZed just pokes you down in teamfights or dives your backline.

He has to be hella strong to be able do that job well enough to contribute to the team.","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"GoldenTomat0","date":"2015-08-10T13:27:57.820+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"zed's shit atm lmao.\njust about every other assassin is better than him.","replies":[]},{"poster":"RonyStark","date":"2015-08-11T01:24:13.393+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"vs Zed mid? {{champion:54}} laughs \"Hoh ho\"","replies":[]},{"poster":"SorakaXHealBoT","date":"2015-08-10T14:25:10.687+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Just Play Fizz and use E and laugh at Zed's ult.
