Zilean. Veigar.\n\nThese Champions are already very complicated - Changing Kog'Maw's Caustic Spittle to a skillshot doesn't really go with his kit at all and adds a level of complication that I think is unnecessary, the only application of his Q is in a standing, front-onwards 1v1 with another carry, otherwise it's such short range and such a risk to apply that it renders the skill useless - this Champion is already horrendously complex and varying - this just made it that much worse and rendered him - for me, a no play.\n\nZilean. While changing his bombs to a skillshot gave him some severe lane presence, I think it was completely unneccesary, Zilean is a versatile support who can mix up team fights effectively with slows, bombs and his ultimate, he is very placement important and I think he is now the new Xerath and does very little else - having lost his short range placement in team-fights in favour of spending all his mana lobbing time bombs.\n\nXerath - Xeraths ultimate is huge range now, with little or no counterplay - while I'm a little less inclined to not favour Xerath I think Riot has added interest to the League in doing this, at the expense of a playable Champion as the projectiles are slow and relatively easy to dodge in mid lane close quarters trades and I feel like Riot have tried to give him the presence of a Twisted Fate but his ganks aren't really that good - they just look cool in pro play.\n\nAnd last but not least, Veigar. I feel like Veigar has lost his lane presence in having to skillshot minions now and has to position far more aggressively and while I do feel Veigar was a stupidly strong snowballer and feel like he is in a balanced position, this change has made him needlessly complicated and awkward to position.\n\nBard is inclined towards this skillshot favouring playstyle, I just don't see what Riot has against on target abilities.\n\nBard's never land their stuns unless the gameplay is linear and while I think he's an interesting Champion, I think Riot has gone overboard in defavoritizing on-target abilities and straight-forward Champions to make the game look cooler and failed on many fronts in doing so.\n\nIn my opinion, a simple Champion does not necessarily make for simple plays. I think Riot has spent too long watching games and not long enough playing them, because all these skillshots are so *yawn*. I miss old school Jax, post-nerf Katarina and pre-nerf Rengar and while I love all-in smash 'em up fights and huge snipe fests with Nidalee, Lux, Morgana and pre-change Xerath, I feel like Riot has gone way too far with over-complicating things (see examples Veigar, Zilean, Bard and Xerath) and this has taken away from the complications these Champions already have/have had about their kit and the skillshot meta has taken away from more interesting item concepts (actives and such), and see Riot trending in favour of even such things as auto attacks being skillshots.\n\nI'm not saying there's something wrong with skillshots, just a lot of the Game is spent hiding behind minions and all the changes to Champions of late have led to the game becoming a linear-fest of straight down the line auto-attackers and straight down the line skillshots with a lot of the more diverse Champions taking a back seat because if you miss one skillshot it's GG and simple skillshotters like Caitlyn, Graves and Jinx have taken favour over more skill-taking positioner Ashe, harder skill-shotter Quinn and even twitch and Varus are all far less popular in my games because Champions like Ahri, Nidalee, Morgana and Lulu can afford to miss skillshots without being hugely punished, whereas Quinn, Varus and champions like Lux etc cant and its made all team comps relatively stale.\n\nPlease Riot, stop making the game about skillshots and leave us some reliable Champions to compete with these Champions (Jinx, Nidalee, Ahri, Morgana and Lulu) because as is some of the more awesome Champions (Lux, Orianna, Lissandra and Karma) really cant compete with their brute force and safe skillshots and some of their better counters (Zilean, Veigar, Xerath etc) have lost their ease of use and left the meta about safe poke, not fun times and the majority of high skill Champions are unpicked because no one can take safe guaranteed damage allies because they are all now being shaped towards skillshots and or more counter-pokey setups and this has left some of the more awesome team comps unpickable.\n\nTy for your time, if you read this far - simply my thoughts on the Meta as is, how it has shaped from changes of late (excluding a lot about items and the map). I think some more guaranteed raw on-target damage would help, I think changing Zilean, Veigar and Kog'Maws skills to skillshots was a bad idea and I think rectifying or re-affecting changes to counteract this would help the games diversity (contradictorily through playstyle, kit mixups & because of lane comps etc) and maybe even open up room for some new items (I also think new items are always a good idea and while I think the game is highly competitive think you should not forget it is about fun and some funky stereotypical items/Champions would rock, rather than very sharp, scientific Champs/items).\n\n-KiStorm.\n\nSorry, Haven't proofread and it is early in the morning, I just felt like speaking out about the changes to Zilean, Veigar and Kog'Maw because I think it was a bad idea. Prove me wrong. I'm open minded, I just think its a step in the wrong direction and have explained why and I also think however I could simply be over-reacting and have taken it the wrong way, but I doubt it.","replies":[{"poster":"iNoob","date":"2015-03-22T05:05:05.728+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Xerath is really immobile, one cc spell on him and he gets dove in tm fights, lane phase he also needs to be careful because of no gap closers... \nhis ult requires a lot of practice and u also become immobile upon using it.... \n\nVeigar is probably better after that change because now u can get more ap, and the new ap item + q change allows for decent kiting... \n\nIf this game didn't have skill shots it would lack skill and become sort of boring...\nLike in lcs, when xerath goes e > w > q and the person walks away with say 40% health, then they land 3 of their ult shots for the finisher, it makes the game more entertaining from a viewer perspective, as well as giving a level of mechanics for players to aim for.... if Xerath r became point and click the difference between an amazing xerath and an average exerath wouldn't be as significant... the more complex the game gets the bigger the competitve scene gets due to either skill floor or skill cap... i think skill floor not sure tho... and the game becomes more exicting with more possibilities...","replies":[]},{"poster":"Chalze","date":"2015-03-21T22:50:38.685+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Zilean - He was never a ‘versatile support’ in most metas man…\n\nXerath - His ult shows a circle for range to enemy team which makes it way too obvious that he’s gonna fire them…\n\nVeigar - He can stack more AP if played right now…\n\nBard - He’s a new champ…let him sink in man…","replies":[]}]}
