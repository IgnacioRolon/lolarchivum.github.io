Like you can see the smog, I mean hello - stop it.\n\nYet they start \"slowing it down\" or don't even do that.\n\nThey're still driving cars around, they're still running their factories and they're not learning that the pollution is a problem and they didn't warn the rest of the world you know: This stuff is killing our wildlife, waterways and our highest killer is now cancer and we can't actually walk around in some of our cities without dying because the air is that bad; maybe you guys should stop your polluting - they're just continuing and the rest of the world is continuing and it's an embarrasment.","replies":[{"poster":"Project Xayah","date":"2015-12-16T01:30:45.281+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> you can see the smog\n\nBecause they have a crap ton of people in a very small area. In comparison, China has a population density of about 140/Km² while Australia has about 3/Km². Naturally there's going to be a significant difference in how easy it is to see the smog in large cities in each country considering the difference in population density (and, thus, the difference in amount of air pollution generated).\n\nFact is, every country is playing a part in \"polluting themselves to death\". It's a worldwide problem, not just a Chinese problem.","replies":[{"poster":"Jink","date":"2015-12-16T07:17:08.247+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=HeartVine,realm=OCE,application-id=Ntey9fRZ,discussion-id=15WgcfA3,comment-id=000000000000,timestamp=2015-12-16T01:30:45.281+0000)\n>\n> Because they have a crap ton of people in a very small area.

They poison their own waterways, certain places the air is unbreathable without harmful side-effects (death).\n\nChina could stop, but they don't. The rest of the world could look at this and stop, but they don't.\nThe global government are despicable human beings doing nothing but squander their power and spit on the livelihood of the future generations with their incompetence and refusal to take action or responsibility to do the right thing or in doing the right thing: asking for help, enacting change or quitting.","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"CandyVanisClosed","date":"2015-12-15T00:57:24.671+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Double digit growth will do this they have have had massive grow for 25 years now just like us here in Australia,but we have had modest growth only 3percent...and that is why you see there in trouble now..","replies":[]}]}
