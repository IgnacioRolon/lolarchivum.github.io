Anivia, Anni, Azir, Bard, Blitz, Brand to some extent - all have incredible zoning at no real cost to themselves.\n\nBraum is just a beast. Mundo&#039;s pretty broken because as an ADC you usually want giant slayer but no one really has the ability to drop his heal properly, plus his damage - tankiness ratio is pretty ridiculous.\n\nEve lacks any real counterplay. Fiora&#039;s just broke as hell and after she was mained at worlds, I thought a nerf of more than jusst cutting her utli&#039;s heal for enemies that die at a lower number of marks triggered was a bit underwhelming. She does insane amounts of damage with cleaver and deadmans and puts other Champions to shame. She refuses to die and can insatgib people and even do so to tanky champs with her ulti and lacks counter-building. Fizz is just annoying, but he&#039;s probably not deserving of this list but once he has zhonya&#039;s he is way more slippery than he deserves to be, with the amount of burst he has and his only clearly defined weakness is being melee which he has a 2 natural counters to so like his weakness isn&#039;t really a weakness in most cases and he is so anti-burst he shuts down burst which is his main counter and his only real weakness is a malzahar suppress - most of his lane counters are no where near as countering as certain other matchups which is what a lot of this is based on, certain champions have 0 counterplay to others in lane but there are a lot - like fizz and a lot of those listed - that can simly outdo their counters over time and it&#039;s a bit annoying that the game is shaped like this, because it makes people spam similar champs - even when coutnering enemies team compositions or strategies.\n\nGP&#039;s damage is ridiculous and he can zone/poke with barrels which means all-inning him is basically impossible and his scaling and damage are off the charts; as is his ability to remove CC and heal.\n\nHeimer has been broken for a long time, without a solid counter pick he is beyond a joke just a free win Champion.\n\nJax is broken with Rageblade right now, his damage - while counterable - makes him more safe a pick than he should be, despite his counterplay.\n\nJinx is just stupid, no champ has anything like the damage output this champ does in certain fights and her kit makes her a bit of a joke when it comes to solo queue.\n\nLee Sin is played like every single game because he has a billion ways to combat physical damage dealers and he is the most annoying champ in the game. He even saw some pro play because he is broken. Simple broken.\n\nMalphite is stupidly tank for the amount of sustained damage he can deal in lane and combo&#039;s extremely well with a lot of other champions, making him pretty top tier in certain team comps. The game shouldn&#039;t have OP team comps because it represents a mechanical flaw in the game where experimentatio or favouring certain champs loses out to a few kit combos and while it is funny, it craps on the concept of balance when you get wombo&#039;d AND it deals tons of damage so things like this should have damage balancing so a powerful utility isn&#039;t also insane damage and there should be more risk involved too. So many ult cooldowns are way off being fair and so many Champs have been gutted so that people main tanks and crap like that or play button mashers and noob cannons (Jinx) and it&#039;s a disappointment and the base damages and scalings and cooldowns of a lot of champions are the root cause and it seriously needs to be looked at when certain Champs get their ulti&#039;s twice as fast as others - yet it is a core of their kit and the other Champ with low cooldown ultis has 3 other effective ways of trading or CC&#039;ing or healing ETC.\n\nSona&#039;s a bit broken right now too.. You nerfed her into the ground then this patch she became stupidly strong. I didn&#039;t put her on this list because these other champions are more often a problem and lack counters and counterplay.\n\nSituationally OP is less annoying than consistently OP.\n\nYis just broken, don&#039;t even wanna go there.\n\nShen&#039;s lane phase and damage is stupid for a tank CC engager with a %Max own HP dmg ability. Tahm&#039;s broken. Don&#039;t wanna go there either.\n\nThresh is in like every game because he is stupidly versatile and one hook is usually certain death or a massively lost trade and he suffers what - 50 mana? 12 seconds? Yeah that&#039;s not balanced at all. Neither is Blitz.\n\nTryndamere lacks counterplay. You have to blow CC&#039;s to try and pin him during ulti and there aren&#039;t a lot of Champions that as a team can chain CC him during his ulti to slow down his retreat between auto&#039;s and then lock him down after he&#039;s about to become vulnerable and the amount of damage and skills he can draw out during this just make him stupidly strong in solo queue.\n\nTF - ranged 2 second stun on like a 4 second cooldown? I mean really?\n\nMained in worlds 24/7 since the beginning of time and you don&#039;t see a problem?\n\nI didn't talk about Annie, she just free wins lane and is usually broken and season 6 saw her a monstrosity that while not played often is just basically a beast at all stages of the game and the counters to her are rarely effective as is the counterplay and counter-itemisation.\n\nEdit: I know a lot of this is probably wrong, or there are flaws in my ideation or even worse problems in the game, but a lot of League balance seems to reflect from players opinions and this just how I feel about the game in it's current state - Champion wise.\n\nIt's frustrating when you die and you look at a Champion and they just have something that's hard to deal with skill-wise and it's annoying to try to pre-think a billion different scenarios when picking and then end up with 5 solid counters anyway and it would be nice if we could counter-itemize or something moreso so the game was more about skill, than simply clicking lock - and right now, it's a bit of a random shuffle and usually one team absolutely dominates most lanes, or all lanes - and most of it is just dynamics and laning and people that play off-meta usually get smashed, people main these pog op champions and its putting games in such a trashy spot where im like 2 second stunned from range and at basically no cost and I have to prepare for that and the only real thing i can do is pick up QSS and cleanse it, but then I've still taken damage and copped followups so I have to pick someone that can just out-do this mechanic and while there are ways around it, when every player on a team has to deal with a possible 2 second stun and someone is going to have to take one for the team - it's a bit stupid that in the grand scale of things champs like TF just point click 2 second ranged stun you, in the scheme of things - and we cant ban out all these Champs to indicate what we dislike about the game - but this is something I dislike about the game, coz when I look at his kit - he's a beast, like so many other champs - overall and its annoying that people play the same small pool 90% of the time- based on power and preference - rather than jsut preference and people often dont even bother picking combos, even though there are a lot of OP ones, they just pick lee sin and TF and its like \"yay\" 2 op champs and we have to play OP Champs to compete with them because if we wanna counterplay we have like \"Nocturne\" or \"maybe nidalee\" as options to coutner them completely and yet in taking those champs have 2 explicit weaknesses (tanks and mass CC) and the enemy teams picks always seem to reflect the failings of this game because they'll just pick a stupidly versatile tank or something with no real counters or counterplay and go for team fights where dealing with these Champions pick wise is irrelevant because they have several other targets and there aren't really multiple counters to a lot of champs or team composition counters.\n\nThis was sort of reflected in worlds, because it was more about planning and strategy than picks - because they all just spammed OP Champs and went for picks - and little of it was teamfights and when there were team fights, compositions shone but there were no heavily strategized compositions and counter-compisitions, it was just minor co-operations etc; like Kassadin and an AP top so that an AP counter was less effective because most of them are AD and kass has huge disengage and things like this; most compositions and counters are affected heavily by laning and laning against OP Champions which you can't really deny are a reality means you are shut out of the game permanently and there is often very little you can do and I think at the very least something drastic needs to be done to make this game more fun - because it is a complely let down to face ridiculously strong things and forever the bane of MOBAs.","replies":[{"poster":"JasonWazza","date":"2015-12-24T21:54:58.325+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"What's wrong with bard (also Braum but bard is the main one)?\n\nBtw they made pinks cheaper, and your still complaining about eve (not to mention they weakened her jungle again)?\n\nImmobile champions on this list: Anivia, Annie, Brand, Heimer.\n\nCounter them with mobility and burst.\n\nChamps that rely on gold: Jax, Master Yi, Tryndamere\n\nEnd the game by using the 4v5 to your advantage.\n\nLegitmately strong champs on this list: Anivia, GP, Fizz, Mundo, Fiora.

Top lane - you can't pink ward both entrances to lane. GG. Same goes for mid, there are 6 places she can come from. It was nice when we could ward a few places with Green wards so we could see her at neutrals and know where she was and make plays based on where she might be but now that is basically impossible and you don't get Farsight until level 9. Playing safe for this whole time is a joke.\n\nAnivia almost 2 shots me late game.\n\nHeimer is vulnerable, yet deals insane amounts of damage at range anyway and can sit safe the majority of the time - as can Anivia and Annie and Brand. Being a slow moving source of tons of damage is not really something a lot of Champions can exploit.\n\nAmbient Gold got buffed and basically every Champ is squishy now so champs like this are punishing, plus they've nerfed every defensive item in existence and even made them useless overall compared to DPS builds seeing as the highly aggressive team fighting benefits the glass cannon brand at the back of a Mundo, not the Annie that got GA to deal with Yi - bad example but that's how it is.\n\nNo Tahm just eats you which is like a 4 second stun, does 600 dmg then spits you aat his team and then stuns you and the follows while being insanely tanky with 0 counterplay other than complete all ins since he heals almost all the harass damage if you don't keep on him and is a cancer idea in general added to his tongue lash and devour as well as it being able to save team-mates and a massive teleport with an ally and all in all he's a broken p.o.s.\n\nHe doesn't deserve an honorable mention because he's a pog champion. I'm glad you agree Fiora is overpowered, I find her more problematic than Mundo or any of the other champs.\n\nHowever I am aware I am biased in my opinions because I play a lot of ADC and a fair lot of top - moved out of mid lane and I still like jungling a few Champs like Shyv and Sej - but because I play a specific set of Champs most of the time and main a few roles most of my observations and ideas are based on myself - despite occasionally seeing teamwide effects and making team based observations a lot of the time I am focused on myself so miss things or whatever but when I end up versing a lot of these Champions, they lack a lot of counterplay, counter-itemisation or counterpicking.","replies":[{"poster":"JasonWazza","date":"2015-12-26T00:35:06.236+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":">Ambient Gold got buffed and basically every Champ is squishy now so champs like this are punishing\n\nI just want to cover this quickly, it's not the fault of Riot that people are building squishy when there is so many ways to build tanky and still be relatively strong.\n\nAD's (not ADC's) have this in spades in that a lot of the strong AD items, that have tank stats involved, but there is a decent amount of AP items that do the same thing.\n\nAD hybrid tank items, Maw (hexdrinker), Mercurial Scimitar (this shit comes with life steal now) Dead man's plate (this is hybrid as much as people would argue it's not, 50 damage on first auto), Iceborn (comes with a Sheen passive, and a crap ton of armour and CDR), Black Cleaver, Titanic Hydra, Sterak's Gage\n\nAP hybrid tank items, Rylai's, Liandry's, RoA, Abysal, Athene's, Banner (for being a real %%%% to Magic damage dealers), Zhonya's.\n\nIt's not like either of these lists are short, or in short supply of giving you multiple paths for defensive offensive picks (aside from the armor side of the AP, but let's face it, Zhonya's is basically good in all cases there)","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Alfawarrior3","date":"2015-12-24T23:38:38.239+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"except brand is arguably the most balanced champion in the game lmao.","replies":[{"poster":"Jink","date":"2015-12-25T09:15:10.314+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Alfawarrior3,realm=OCE,application-id=Ntey9fRZ,discussion-id=6geRhr7X,comment-id=0003,timestamp=2015-12-24T23:38:38.239+0000)\n>\n> except brand is arguably the most balanced champion in the game lmao.\n\nWould rate him Tier 1 OP.
