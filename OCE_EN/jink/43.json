(80 AD plus 40 AD plus 90ish base plus 40 AD plus 30 AD = roughly 300).\n\nAdd an AD scaling AOE, natural armor stats, %Max HP damage and a movespeed steroid and if AD Shyvana wasn't prone to kiting and wasn't hugely dependent on someone else to engage in this squishier play style you would have one mad top laner.","replies":[{"poster":"Exhausted","date":"2015-06-10T21:54:27.623+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"yea \"cow sweep\" was doing this a while back, he brings it out every now and then when he isnt spamming yi.","replies":[]},{"poster":"oops","date":"2015-06-11T09:18:11.666+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Why trinity force over shiv?
