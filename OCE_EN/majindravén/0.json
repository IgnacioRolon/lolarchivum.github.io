The support page has a separate login, and there has been a recent conflict with the two logins.\n\nIf you did that and are still having issues, you can reach out to the Support Twitter: https://twitter.com/RiotSupport and they should be able to help you more.\n\nYou could also try updating your graphics card drivers and your DirectX (https://support.microsoft.com/en-au/help/179113/how-to-install-the-latest-version-of-directx) which may resolve your issue.\n\nIf you have any other games running at the time I would recommend closing them as some games can cause DirectX conflicts. If you run in fullscreen mode I would also recommend not alt tabbing in the loading screen as this can also cause resource conflicts.","replies":[{"poster":"YourRentIsDue","date":"2018-04-02T11:42:59.432+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"my graphics card drivers and direct X are updated to the latest version and the screenshot was in incognito mode.
