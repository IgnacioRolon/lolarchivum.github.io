His mysterious, quiet nature and dangerous lifestyle is all that is known about him. From his frequent sightings of fighting dragons at the summit of unclimbable mountains, or leaving the entrance of a deadly, forbidden and accursed cave soaked in blood, he is a warrior with a reputation as mysterious as himself. His weapon of choice is a giant Ultra-Great Sword that he carries over one shoulder. It is so heavy that not even Tryndamere can lift it with his right arm. \r\n\r\nHe seldom converses with the people of Rune Terra, however he occasionally offers his services, slaying creatures or enemies for any king or general who requests a summons for him. All he accepts in exchange is bare living necessities. He does not offer his sword in combat in battles or wars for Lucas fights alone. \r\n\r\nThat is, until the day he joined the League of Legends. \r\n\r\nRole:\r\nTop Lane/Tank\r\nFighter\r\nJungler\r\n\r\n\r\nPassive:\r\n\r\nEndless Onslaught: Lucas's standard abilities have no cool downs. He relies on regenerating energy instead. \r\n\r\nUltra Great Sword: Lucas's Ultra Great-sword auto attacks deals damage in a small arc to any enemy unlucky to be caught by it, and does 2% extra damage per auto attack. This does not damage lane minions.\r\n\r\nKnight's Armour. Each auto attack grants him a small shield for 2/4/6 damage for 0.5 seconds. (Does not stack.)\r\n\r\nAbilities: \r\n\r\nQ: Slash \r\n\r\nLucas slowly but with immense strength swings his great sword horizontally, dealing damage in an arc. \r\nIf he activates this spell again within 2 seconds, he swings again in the opposite direction but much faster. Slows enemies by 20% for 1/1.25/1.5/1.75/2 seconds (Only affected by one swing)\r\n\r\nIf Lucas activates Slash within 1.5 seconds after performing a Backstep, he will lunge forward two steps before casting Slash.\r\n\r\nDeals 50/100/150/200/250 (+60% Attack Damage) \r\nConsumes  25 Energy\r\n\r\nW: Knight's Shield / Backstep (Toggle, Active)\r\n\r\nLucas lifts his large knight's shield, massively increasing his defence and magic resist. However, he cannot use spells or regenerate energy and he attacks with his shield instead, dealing reduced damage. \r\n\r\nIf Lucas actives W again within 0.5 seconds, he instead performs a short Backstep allowing him to dodge a melee auto attack if timed correctly. \r\n\r\nIncreases armour and magic resist by 20/30/40/60/80 while Knight's Shield is toggled. \r\n\r\nConsumes 10 Energy. After 3 seconds, Attacks against him while Knight's Shield is toggled consumes 5 Energy, and Lucas will lower his shield at 0 Energy. \r\nConsecutive Backsteps within 5 seconds consume an additional 20 Energy\r\n\r\nE: Overhead Slash.\r\n\r\nLucas takes two step forward while swinging his massive sword overhead towards the player's cursor, allowing its direction to be changed while being cast. It deals damage in a thin line, stunning enemies for 1 second. \r\nLucas will not take two steps forward with consecutive casts within 2 seconds. \r\n\r\nDeals 30/60/90/120/150 (+7.5 % Max Health) (+40% Attack Damage)\r\nConsumes 25 Energy\r\n\r\nR: The Great Pummel. \r\n\r\nLucas takes a short run-up and leaps into the air, and then slams his sword vertically into the ground, dealing massive damage in a small area to enemies and knocking them them away from the centre of impact. The ground is struck with such force that a projectile of energy will emit from the tip of the blade.\r\n \r\nDeals 150/300/600 (+60 % bonus Attack Damage) \r\nEnemies will only be dealt damage from either the projectile or the impact. \r\nConsumes 25 Energy.\r\n80/60/50 seconds cool down. \r\n\r\nPlay-Style.\r\n\r\nLucas is the definition of a Bruiser. Although he has low mobility, he can fight without the frustration of being easily kited thanks to his long ranged sword attacks. With skilfully timed attacks and good aim he will be rewarded with devastating damage. However, his attacks are slow and difficult to land especially against mobile champions who can escape his Slash even while the sword is still being swung. His kill potential is somewhat low compared to assassins, but his high base damage attacks can enable him to gain lane dominance without kills. Chaining Attacks in Combo's is important to making plays. He needs to choose wisely between using backstep as a gap closer or save it for a disengage, as well as choosing between maximum damage or a harder to evade combo.  \r\n\r\nHe should build a combination of attack damage and defensive items, to make as much use of his Ultra-Greatsword's passive as long as possible.  His Ultra Pummel's projectile will be unlikely to hit enemies during a teamfight, but can be used in laning to snipe opponents.  \r\n\r\nTips:\r\n\r\nPlaying as Lucas - \r\nManaging Energy is essential to performing effective combo's. For example, using Backstep followed by Slash will let you cover more distance then Overhead Slash but will not leave you enough energy to disengage.\r\nAvoid using spells too much, for example constantly back stepping from attacks will leave you with no energy to fight back!\r\nUse Knight's Shield to Protect your carries and reduce incoming damage from skill shots and abilities. \r\n\r\nPlaying Against Lucas\r\nPlay more aggressive after Lucas uses his abilities and thus has less energy to fight back\r\nAvoid attacking him in team fights while he has his Knight's Shield toggled. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nExplanation.\r\n\r\n I felt the need for a champion that does satisfyingly chunky attacks like what Nautilus feels like but doesn't do. Lucas skills are simple and easy to use, unlike the last few champions released. However, his skills can be combo'd, require skilful aiming to land, and can be utilised in ways that make them fun and complex, His ideal play style would be a tank top lane bruiser who should  aim to give other members of the team kills when he can because of his large base damage. If he does get ahead he can still carry just through the large chunks of damage he does, constantly withering down the enemies heal bar. He can jungle thanks to his Great Swords passive but may not have as fast clearing speed as more DPS focussed junglers. \r\n\r\nWith no cool downs, he can spam his skills as much as he desires, however it will not make him overpowered.\r\nHis Q will slow Lucas's own movement speed while he hauls his heavy sword through the air. \r\nHis E takes 1.5 seconds to cast while the stun lasts only 1 second, meaning if cast continuously there is a good chance of the enemy dodging at the last second.\r\nHis W backstep will allow him to annoy melee opponents but will leave him without enough energy to trade back. \r\n I tried to make him not too overpowered (3 Passives I know, but his abilities don't grant him much lifestyle or armour except for Knights Shield which acts more as a block since he can't trade while it's toggled). \r\n\r\nAdvice/Constructive Critism/Damage Modification Suggestions will be greatly appreciated!","replies":[{"poster":"Katsprky","date":"2015-01-19T20:11:55.337+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"\"The last knight\" is a tacky name. :c\nThere are a lot of knights left, not to mention there is a war going on.

Other than that cool concept, and I do agree a sluggish high damage tank is needed in this game. Also this guy will be a pain in the back if he gets tri force, icebourne and/or frozen mallet. And he is horrible for URF...","replies":[]}]}
