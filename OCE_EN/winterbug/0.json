Twitch is consistently topping the adc winrate board since he just does so much damage and can run away with games after grabbing a lead in laning phase. Xayah is solid at all stages of the game and rewards skill, she's pretty much immune to assasin's if you're playing with a team that will group around you and can one shot squishies with her e.\n\nkai sa is similar to azir where she can do really well but only really in high mmr where the team knows how to play around their adc. Trist is nerfed. Jhin is unreliable and trash when behind. Draven has many problems.","replies":[]}]}
