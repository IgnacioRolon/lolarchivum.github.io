I knew that riot wants to make each champion unique so instead of doing a solo spider I was thinking about the rare cases of social spiders, spiders that work as groups. Before I knew it I was thinking of the zerg in starcraft but let&#039;s not get too deep into that. Instead of doing a bunch of spiders I thought of doing a complete army of insects created to adapt and destroy, kinda like a mix of kha&#039;zix and the zerg. Anyways, this is just an idea but here was my take on it\r\n\r\nPassive: Survival of the smartest\r\nEverytime Plague levels up, after increasing his spell he can increase one of his 6 base stats (hp, ad, ap, armor, magic resist, movement speed) by 2% maxing up to a 20% boost on one stat.\r\nOnce Plague has chosen a stat, he cannot take that stat buff back.\r\nWhile Plague is boosting the stat, he goes in a small stasis where he cannot move but he cannot take damage either.\r\n\r\nQ: Natural selection\r\nNatural selection passively creates corpses of the dead that interact with this spell.\r\nNatural selection can only be used on a living target when it&#039;s able to kill them (think of cho&#039;gath ult but weaker)\r\nNatural selection being used on corpses is weaker but provides faster digestion.\r\nWhen Plague uses Natural selection, Plague consumes the target, switching to digestion mode.\r\nIn digestion mode, Plague becomes more tanky but is now a melee character and cannot use spells. \r\nDigestion mode increases a stat based off what Plague eats (consuming a caster minion increases his ap, consuming a melee minion increases his ad, siege increases his hp and when Plague consumes a champion, Plague gains a portion of the champions max stat).\r\nBeing killed while digestion will not give him the stat buff.\r\nDigestion mode lasts longer the bigger his target is (unfortunately cannot eat dragon or baron as they are too big to fit in his stomach).\r\nNatural selection has a one second cooldown after finishing digestion \r\n\r\nW: Hive den\r\nPlague naturally creates a nest and stores it (stacking three times).\r\nPlague can plant the nest (only can plant two at a time) which creates a web like terrain in a circle around it.\r\nPlague gains mana and movement speed on the web terrain, allies only gain the mana but not the movement speed.\r\nEnemies who walk in the web are slowed and the nest starts spawning spider warriors who will instantly aggro on whoever entered on it, spawning more the more enemies stand in it and spawning stronger the longer they stand in it.\r\nIf an enemy destroys a nest, they gain a temporary movement speed buff.\r\n\r\nE: Wasp swarm\r\nPlague sends out a swarm of wasps in a straight line.\r\nWasps that hit enemies reduce their armor and magic resist, applying a poison overtime.\r\nWasps that falls short or misses champions remain where the skill shot ended, enemies who walk into the lingering swarm or are swarmed by another group of wasps nearby draw aggro of the lingering wasp swarms.\r\nGetting swarmed by multiple swarms of wasps take increased damage over time for longer periods of time.\r\nGetting swarmed by multiple swarms does not increase the armor and magic resist debuff.\r\nIf a champion dies with the swarm debuff, they once again linger waiting to attack another champion.\r\nLingering swarms may not attach to enemy minions or jungle monsters but they will do damage to them over time if they stay within the range of the swarms.\r\n\r\nR: Control parasite\r\nPlague splits a percentage of his current health and targets an enemy.\r\nPlague marks the enemy with a parasite and the enemy takes damage over time equal to the amount Plague lost.\r\nThe mark of the parasite remains for a while even after the damage overtime is already dealt.\r\nIf an enemy is killed with the parasite while Plague is alive, he regains his missing health back.\r\nIf an enemy is killed with the parasite after Plague dies, Plague temporarily gains control of their body, the cool downs of their spells being when they were marked, not when they died (They cannot use ult if the enemy didn&#039;t have ult when Plague gave them the parasite, meaning Plague becomes as strong or as weak as the host was when they were infected) (Any spells, summoner spells or whatnot does not transfer to the enemy when they respawn).\r\n\r\nPlease tell me how I can improve this champion. I was hoping to achieve a champion who can adapt to any role he is given. If he is behind can needs more tank stats but has no money or time to go back to lane, he can use his passive to catch up. I wanted him to be able to also pick up the best stats of enemies but doing so would make him broken unless it would be risky to do so (being unable to use offensive spells is a big disadvantage and would be stupid unless he got slightly more tanky, which thinking about it could save his life in certain scenarios). Also as you cannot change your passive boosts, getting a boost in defenses early might be a disadvantage as your potential to do more damage late game is decreased.\r\nAlso being based off a spider, I wanted his maximum potential to be when he is inside his web. However, I also wanted him to be based off hunting spiders, ants, locusts or otherwise a plague, endlessly moving around ravaging anything in its path and adapting to become immune to whatever countermeasures people use. However, just like a Plague, early detection and removal stops him from unleashing it&#039;s unstoppable damage. \r\nI gave Natural selection a longer digestion time on living targets as it is a pretty strong execution and it takes longer to digest something that is still alive and fighting inside your stomach. I want hive dens to be the safe haven for allies similar to that of moving towers but thinking that was op, I wanted them to get an advantage of staying or fighting inside them. Basically it acts as a mixture of a tower and a zz&#039;rot portal, but I made it only spawn spider units when enemies stepped on it as I didn&#039;t want to give Plague massive pushing potential with it (lane control yes but not pushing power). Wasp swarms I wanted to be the ultimate cancer, similar to that of malzahars aids. The damage and cooldown of the wasps are actually pretty small so I wanted to focus on it&#039;s ability on working as a team, stacking it for more damage for longer periods of time and how as you get more and more in a single swarm, it&#039;s potential is almost infinite.\r\nThe Ultimate itself was a special case. I was inspired by a certain fungi that is actually a parasite that consumes and controls the body of ants and uses it to promote the spread of it&#039;s dangerous spores. I couldn&#039;t find of any parasites that could do any controlling damage similar to it, only parasites that left diseases in it&#039;s hosts seemed to be the most dangerous ult. I wanted to create a champion who could ressurect himself after death but I wanted to mix it up. My thinking was along the lines of &quot;you have built Plague to adapt to the enemy team so why not use the enemy against themselves?&quot;, by choosing who you ult, you have to think ahead assuming that you may die. Ulting a katarina could result in you getting a pentakill but ulting the god damn taric may end up saving the teammates lives or even turn around a losing teamfight. A bad ult is when you take over a champion and the champions abilities are useless in the situation you are given as most of the time you may find yourself caught out behind enemy lines.\r\nAlso, I gave Plague little cc other than the slow on the webs as a real Plagues only cc is death :D","replies":[]}
