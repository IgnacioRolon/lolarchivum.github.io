This is a champ that I thought up around 4am after binge watching for 2 days straight (dont judge my sleeping habits, I prolly had 30 minutes sleep here and there but just know that i caught up with breaking bad, got up to season 3 of walking dead and caught up with small series like flash and psycho-pass). Anyway, hope you can enjoy. I don't mind feedback but im spending christmas up to february with my cousins in ireland and im not sure if i'll have wifi all the time.\r\n\r\nKyssa is a melee champion that uses health, buffs and debuffs to take down her enemies. Although it does take her health to cast her abilities, the difference between her health and her enemies also take into effect what damage she does to them. She can go tank and soak up all the damage while doing quite a bit herself, ap if she wants to focus on assassinating the squishy backlines or ad and rely on staying alive while doing as much damage as possible before she dies. \r\n\r\nPassive - Kiss of the Queen\r\nAfter using a spell, her next basic attack will charm her enemy for 1 second and leave a debuff called \"queens lust\" that decreases movement speed by 7% if they chase another champion or run toward an ally for 5 seconds. After this, they will have a passive called \"lust fulfilled\" that lasts 35 seconds which make them immune to the kiss of the queen. \r\n\r\nQ - Discontent / Avarice\r\nDiscontent - Upon use of her first Q, she stealths for 6 seconds (lasts longer the more you level up) and will have greater movement speed when chasing down champions. Her first attack will mark targets in an aoe circle around her with a debuff called \"Envied\"\r\nAfter using her q, if she has marked any target then she can use q again to activate avarice\r\nAvarice       -  Once activated, she detonates the debuffs so any target with it will do aoe damage to themselves and those around it. If she is within a certain distance to these explosions, she gets a buff called \"greed is good\" that makes her do extra damage to targets with less than 50% health for a small period of time.\r\n\r\nW - Indolence / Egotism\r\nIndolence - Target smite. Upon use, target gets a debuff called \"sluggified\" which roots them for 2 seconds and removes any cdr / atk spd for 3.5 seconds as well as slowing targets around them in a short aoe circle.\r\nAs long as the root applies, she can then use w again to activate egotism\r\nEgotism    - Kyssa dashes to any target she chooses. Any targets between her and her target are slowed. If she chooses a target with more hp then her than she gets a buff called \"pride of the pack\" which will make her autos do true damage to her targets while also giving her insane lifesteal and if she gets any kills / assists, the duration of her pride increases by 1.5 seconds. If she dies during this rampage, she deals aoe cc around her and the damage she does turns into a health relic that any ally can pick up by right clicking.\r\n\r\nE - Intolerance / consumation\r\nIntolerance    - Kyssas releases her wrath in a target location. Enemies in the area take damage. If no person is hit, then next will do extra damage stacking 5 times. On the 6th release, all damage done will turn into a health pack that any allied champion can take. remember though, if during stacking one of them do hit an enemy, the stacks go back down to zero.\r\nConsumation is a passive that will scale along side intolerance.\r\nConsumation - Everytime she kills a unit (minion, buff or champion) she stacks a passive called \"Unending Hunger\" which every 10 times will drop three health packs around her that only allies can pick up. The strength of the heal (or how much hp each relic has) will do more the more stacks you have. With 2 points, the health packs start doing aoe healing. When fully maxed, they also heal any debuffs (basically a single target QSS)\r\n\r\nR - Spill their blood\r\nKyssa chooses an area (global) which stuns all enemies in the center and rooting those around. After three seconds, she opens the center and from there her blood seeking army spawns and hunts down any enemies; champions, minions, buffs, camps, structures all alike. After 5 seconds, the gate closes but her army only dies after 5 seconds of inactivity or killed normally in combat.\r\nAlso, because she now has access to her army, she gets a passive \"Xero's training\"\r\nPassive - Xero's training\r\nIf at least 3 of her spells are on cooldown, she becomes a ranged fighter with increased attack speed during that period\r\nTank Kyssa:\r\nThis plays more on letting your team do ze damages while you engage and take the damage. Also remember that she drops health relics so if in a teamfight you ks (not saying you should doe :3) everyone will also have health to keep going. Also, as tank Kyssa you have much more ability to spam the hell out of everything you want since you have heaps of health and regen / lifesteal. Speaking of lifesteal, you can go on more rampages more often because you wont have to worry about being bursted to death. Here you are using your passive to engage / distrupt the enemy team. \r\nAD Kyssa:\r\nThis plays more on marking people with envied as applying it does extra damage the more ad you have. Egotism and intolerance are her main source of damage while the thing that makes her powerful is her ult. Her army scales from the amount of ad she has. They may not have as much AD as you do but if you taking down structures with that much AD think of how much split pushing / xpeke feats you can pull off? just beware that her ult has quite a cooldown so do think carefully on how you use it. Here in this build you will be using your passive to distrupt enemies from commiting to you so that you can keep going as well as kiting with your other one.\r\nAP Kyssa:\r\nAP Kyssa works more of the buffs and debuffs you got running. Avarice will do a shit ton of damage not only to marked enemies but those around them. Also remember that you can proc envy on minions so your wave clear and splitpushing power is extreme. Maybe not as global as AD Kyssa but more helpful since the cooldown on her ult is quite big. Indolence is also AP scaling so when you smite someone, they are toast. Here you are using your passive to be able to increase your DPS without having to be scared of them commiting to you. Before six you probably should though since if you are against someone like orianna who is not melee, she can kill you without you being able to stop her with it, but thats only before six since you then can become a ranged in certain circumstances.\r\n\r\nYea, im done...\r\nthanks for reading this.\r\nMy scanner is broken so I cannot use the drawings I made of her but imagine her a hot version (like with a firey aura) version the vampire queen","replies":[{"poster":"LauchieAvilanche","date":"2014-12-23T12:28:34.969+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"First of all man, that is a very detailed champion idea and it actually sounds like a champ I would honestly like to play in the future. From reading all of the ways to build her I would think tanky would be my thing. This is actually a pretty good champ idea. I hope someone from Riot checks this out","replies":[]}]}
