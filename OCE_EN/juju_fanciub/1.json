If there is nobody to drain from, she gains a small movement speed buff for 1 second.\r\nQ - Force of ruin\r\nXenovia dashes forwards spinning her dual blade around her dealing an aoe circle around her as she moves\r\nW - Insomniac\r\nXenovia creates a clone of herself in an area of her choosing. She can switch places with it as long as it stands. After switching, she can switch again back to her original place also pulling the closest champion within a certain range of her clone.\r\nE - Ripper of magic\r\nXenovia throws her grappling hook. If that hook attaches to an enemy, they distance between her and them will remain the same. If it goes to a tug of war then the champion with more movement speed wins. Spells that close distance like flash will pull the other person (remember stuff like leblancs W or zeds shadow will also drag her but that also applies to Xenovias W and flash as well)\r\nR - Blade dancing\r\nXenovias spells create notes. She can hold up to 5 notes. Activating this ability will play a song, should the notes fit. Every song has a different effect on her, her allies and her enemies. Note (see what I did there :D) that the first song combination will be played and not the second. Xenovia cannot activate this ability without a proper song.\r\n\r\nQuotes\r\nAttacking:\r\n“Sorry ‘bout that”\r\n“Dearly sorry love”\r\n“Why? because I have too”\r\n“Pardon me”\r\n“I was just passing by”\r\n\r\nMovement\r\n“I'm on my way”\r\n“Need to go quick”\r\n“In a rush I see?”\r\n“Hold your horses there dear”\r\n“Grace over speed love”\r\n\r\nUsing Q\r\n“Swoosh”\r\n“Spin”\r\n“Twirl”\r\n“Time to go”\r\n“my apologies”\r\n\r\nUsing W\r\n“Show you ladies how its done”\r\n“Catch ya later”\r\n“sorry, your not my type”\r\n“you're coming with me”\r\n“psych”\r\n\r\nUsing E:\r\n“Why hello there”\r\n“Just passing by”\r\n“Thanks for the gold”\r\n“Surprise to see you here”\r\n“Hi, fine day huh?”\r\n\r\nUsing ult\r\n“In the name of Keena be silent”\r\n“hush now”\r\n“Its raining”\r\n“like a gentle breeze”\r\n“tick tick tock”\r\n\r\nTaunting\r\n“Sorry, was that meant to impress me?”\r\n“Say what?”\r\n“Wanna see a magic trick?”\r\n\r\nChampion select\r\n“Are they still alive? wanna fix that together?”\r\n\r\nLore:\r\nXenovia was just a normal girl before it happened to her. Xenovia lived just like any other teenager did, dating guys and trying new things, anything to keep her from boredom. One day, as she was walking with her boyfriend whom she had dated for months now he had asked her a simple question. \"Could you do me a favour?\" What was the harm? she said to herself. Nodding, he whispered in her ear \"Dont make too much noise when I kill you\". Confused by that statement until it was too late. He had summoned a flaming sword and had stabbed her through the heart with it. \"Tis nothing personal. My higher ups just didnt want someone with your potential to be used as an asset for our enemies. I honestly dont see any of such potential in you but hey, ive been wrong before\" he said, as he calmly walked away leaving her bleeding to death in the middle of the park.\r\nA minute passed and as she was ready to go to the other side she saw one of her classmates running toward her. Instead of being worried or trying to stop the blood flow he simply said \"Glad im not too late. Rise my knight. Serve your new master.\" The puddle of blood around her became a magic circle and instantly she was filled with life. Able to stand now, she stood and from the ground appeared two blades. They were similar in shape and the blades both made of the same deep darkness, one dispersed purple dust around it and the other simply arced with blue lightning. She picked up the First sword and called it chaos for that is what was in store for those in her way and the second one Judgement for that was what was in store for those who had decided to ruin her life.\r\nShe looked to her new master and said \"Im yours, lets hunt them all down\"","replies":[{"poster":"Urgot Bot","date":"2015-02-23T09:32:16.528+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I don't see any real synergy in her abilities. \n\nAlso, it looks like all you do is just build flat move speed on her and pull people into your team with your Zed shadow ability, basically becoming a more complicated Blitzcrank.","replies":[{"poster":"Juju fancIub","date":"2015-02-23T10:15:44.363+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The q is a dash like rivens but she damages everything around her as she spins. The W you activate once to choose where the lb W goes to, you activate again to dash there and then you activate it a third time to go to your original position while dragging the closest champion to her. Her E Keeps the same distance between her and her enemies which either drags them with her to her team or keeps them from engaging in.\n\nHer synergy is that she can close distance between her and her target with her q, then she can choose to either W and pull them to her position and then E to drag them even more to her place or you can E first then W to your team, then instantly go back to where you pulled them from and Q in to engage the team fight. \nShe can use E first then Q to isolate them so that you can pull them in and then W to further isolate them. If they engage to you then you can force them back with your E and dont let them close any distance then spin out and then if youre even more greedy you can pull them from that point to your team / tower.\nWhat im saying is that your Q is used to position / engage / disengage while doing damage around you\nher W is used to jump around for jukes or pull in isolated champions or any backline squishy you can reach by using your Q\nHer E is what makes her kit better because youre basically changing the position of another champion by forcing them back or taking them in, which you can use your Q to help in both situations\nHer Ult is dependent on the skill combinations you do. For example, she can give a global heal around her by playing an intense combo song or she can give everyone extra movement speed by playing a simple combo. Buffs that give extra ad or ap are also possible so long as the combo is in the right order to play a song. Playing smaller songs have smaller cooldowns to larger songs. \n\nW jukes are like leblancs its just that she doesnt dash to a direction then switch back, she chooses where she will teleport, teleports there then can teleport back from before she activated it again, while pulling the closest champion with her whether she likes it or not. That is the difference between leblancs shadow and her mimic\n\nQ is not garens spin to win. Its a dash like trynds where your doing damage around you while dashing but the distance is much shorter and the aoe circle around it is much bigger.\n\nE is not like a thresh or blitzcrank hook where they pull them toward her being stunned, its more like a long ranged skarner ult that doesnt suppress them, only keeps them from charging at you or escaping since it only stops them from changing the distance between them and you\n\nR is somethng original compared to the others where the spells you cast create notes and you play them. For example playing Q W E Q E would give an ap buff whilst Q E W Q E would give an ad buff. Those are the bigger songs (which last longer with a longer cooldown) but you can play small songs like W W where it gives everyone bonus atk speed for three basic attacks.\n\nHope that clarifies more then you think","replies":[{"poster":"Urgot Bot","date":"2015-02-23T11:31:46.058+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"If you have every possible combination of abilities for the ult, this champ would be more complicated than Dota 2's Invoker Hero (Which is saying something).\n\nOther than that, your explanation does clarify things a bit more, but I'm sticking to the fact that this looks like a very complicated Blitzcrank-type champion.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Zrin","date":"2015-02-23T20:26:37.946+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'm no game developer so obviously me telling you how to craft a champion is not my jurisdiction.
