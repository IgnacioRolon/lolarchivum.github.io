Feared units can be feared up to 3 times before being immune to all fears from macressa for another 60 seconds once the third fear has ended.\n\nQ - Shadow dance\nStacking two times, she has the ability to dash in any direction also applying her passive. In this phase she is immune to all cc and if dashing through a champion, will take 3 seconds off the next dash up to a max of 2 champions.\n\nW - Focus sapper\nGoing into a vlad pool like state, she gains extra movement speed. People trapped within her pool are slowly sucked off thier vision (similar to graves smoke bomb but the vision gets more blurry faster if they are closer to Macressa) while getting slowed. She is not immune in this pool but any sources of damage from outside the pool are significantly reduced.\n\nE - Justice / Revenge\nPassive depending on toggle\nJustice - Enemies doing damage to her get a stacking bleed effect \nRevenge - Any enemy that harms Macressa will recive a bonus damage from her depending on how much damage they did to her\n\nR - Mind Break\nMacressa chooses a spot where she creates a magic circle. Everyone besides herself will take damage in movement. If there is less than 3 units in the circle she will heal from a percentage of the damage it causes. This effect makes her able to gain assists from the enemy team. The ultimate troll and backstabber however in that circle enemy units under 20% hp will not take any damage but thier movement speed is severely decreased whilst friends gain extra movement speed.\n\nCompletely broken but once she runs out of cc shes basically useless and probably in a really bad spot if she times everything wrong. All her fear last 1/4 - 1/2 of a second. Fearing units within her magic circle will also apply the movement debuff. Units that escape her circle regain a tad bit of thier hp back.\n\nPersonality is sadistic but humerous. She finds other peoples pains very amusing and her own pain even more. Her thrill for enjoyment causes her to be prone for backstabbing as the look on thier faces give her joy. Not someone you should be playing solo q.\n\nAlso note that Macressa is an anagram on Massacre ","replies":[]}
