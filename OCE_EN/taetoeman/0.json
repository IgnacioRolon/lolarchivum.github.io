PERMANENTLY so i thinks this games a bit bugged, i thought rerolling was meant to give you a tad better shit but i stuck all three of the idiot champs into the circlejerk room to see what creation would come out but i got the shitty &quot;god&quot; of time, just remove zilean from the game and replace him with ekko, send zilean away with his resume and see if you can give him a desk job somewhere or like stick him into a home, actually if he can control time then cant he just make himself younger and less useless, thank you.","replies":[]}
