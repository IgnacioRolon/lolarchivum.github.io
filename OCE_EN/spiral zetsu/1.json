But when a Yasuo is behind, it takes next to nothing for him to get back in the game as a formidable force once again.\r\n\r\nThis is not a Yasuo hate post, its a genuine discussion about should a tanky assassin be able to clear waves so easily, any half-decent Yasuo ends the game with 300+ farm (usually 100 or so more than most everyone else) and it doesn&#039;t really affect the number of time they spend getting kills. Most other champions have to actively put time aside to farm to get a similar amount, which of course means less time fighting. Is it fair/balanced/healthy that some champs (Yasuo in particular) can farm so incredibly easily, and still be a champ that can gets kills so frequently (and escape, so isn&#039;t wasting gold by being dead).\r\n\r\nMost assassins have to get kills to keep up in gold, while other champs such as Mages and ADC&#039;s can afford to be better farmers because they don&#039;t have the kits to get kills as frequently or as constantly. Yasuo has both, and it always gives him the gold advantage.","replies":[{"poster":"Sloth Almighty","date":"2016-08-19T21:50:13.867+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"I would have to agree that Yas is the most neglected champ, when it comes to nerf reviews.\nHe seems to be the son of a wealthy household that everyone in the school tolerates because daddy keeps the school going with all his money.\n\nAny champ can get fed, and carry a game.

I frequent NA boards and see many complains about Yasuo including one from a platinum Yasuo main with over 500 upvotes saying Yasuo needs a rework and is complete cancer to play against. I can find you a lot of anti-Yasuo posts if you want from other boards. It's classic Talon12 to insult people's intelligence without any proper research being conducted. It's okay though, must be exceptionally challenging for you of all people to engage in any kind of civil conversation. \n\n\nAll these people arguing with you is doing so in vain anyways. Hell, I'm typing in vayne because nothing really gets through to you so long as you continue believing that Yasuo is pathetically weak and that everyone is just too retarded to play against him. I mean hell if that isn't being cardboard close minded. Frankly I'm not gonna change your mind because the #Talon12isalwaysrightfoundation is pretty damn big right now.\n\n>Yasuo is the weakest champion to CC.\n\nI'm not even gonna bring a point into this. It highlights just how much you delusional you really are if you actually think Yasuo is the most vulnerable champion to CC.

So having large numbers of new players AND a 50%+ win rate can mean one of two things:\n> \n> 1. Yasuo is incredibly easy to play. \n> 2. Yasuo is overpowered.\n\nhe is second most picked and most banned.

Furthermore, after you're disrespect you continue to add to the discussion like it matters because you ask for the post to be deleted? Nice logic pal.\n> \n\n> \n> FYI, keep a champ in every lane and that yasuo&#x27;s fucked isnt he. Can&#x27;t farm if someone stops him. this goes for every single champ in the game, its not a &quot;yasuo specific&quot; thing, fizz can do the same as well, but his damage ramps back up faster when behind, thats why when a yasuo gets behind he spends **20 minutes** farming back, you people make it sound like 20 min is nothing, you make it sound like he goes afk farm for 30 seconds and he is instantly full build and fed.\n\nSo according to you keeping someone in every lane will mean Yas is going to hate life and quit because someone is there to \"stop\" him. So by stopping him farming you mean standing there waving you're arms at him? If he could just be \"stopped\" there wouldn't be an issue because everyone would just do it! Oh unless you mean every member in the team picks perm cc champions that also have burst damage. Sure ok no worries, I'll keep that in mind next time I'm drafting 1v5 against a Yas.\n\n> And yes his farm is good, but this &quot;get kills easily&quot; crap is wrong, first he needs to spend 10-20 minutes outplaying people to get fed (unless they extremely bad, or the jungle is a complete idiot and doesnt know what ganks or cc do)\n\n LOL! You're right I've never in my League career seen a Yas snow ball of 2-3 kills. 20 minutes of dedicated outplay sounds 100% legit.\n\n> And escape? what is running under enemy tower escaping? he needs enemies to escape.\n\nAgain you're 100% correct. I've never seen a Yas critting his ass off healing faster than the tower and the opponent can do damage. That's sound logic.\n\nHe is by far the most hated, talked about, banned and played champion in the game but that's ok because Riot has deemed this balanced. \nMost people are either a Yas player who love it because it's so op and can outplay a whole team or you're a hater because you're sick of having to deal with it every game. Let me guess which 1 you are. Yep you definitely sound like you are sick of 100% crit with sustain and limitless cd!","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Yuriklatura","date":"2016-08-20T07:45:01.404+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"I believe that all people who commonly play champions such as Fiora, Yasuo, Riven and Lee Sin are usually playing them for the same reason; because they are brain dead easy to play, and not many people know how to counter them properly.\n\nThe easiest counter to them, is not dying to them. That said, simply sitting under tower for the first 15 minutes of a game just because the enemy champion can 100 - 0 you with a Dorans Blade and a couple item ingredients is incredibly counter intuitive. Every other champion in the game has glaringly obvious strengths, weaknesses and counter play.\n\nUp against Xerath or Ziggs? Dodge skill shots and take advantage of their low mobility.\nUp against Renekton or Darius? Stay away from them, and farm while their abilities are on cool down.\nUp against Nasus or Tryndamere? Take advantage of their weak early game and try to kill them before they become strong.\n\nUp against Yasuo, Fiora, Riven or Lee Sin? Might as well just play a different game for 20 minutes because you sure as hell aren't gonna have any fun whatsoever in this lane.\n\nThey are stronger than other champions simply because they have fewer weaknesses.","replies":[]},{"poster":"EzeBlood","date":"2016-08-22T05:50:47.196+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"Why did I comment on this now I have to deal with all of Talon12's shit all over again yay","replies":[]},{"poster":"Fitzky","date":"2016-08-30T09:55:54.575+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"At this point I personally don't think his damage is the problem, if they try to target that for a nerf they could potentially ruin him, its the fact that he can have a 0.1 second dash. I've noticed a lot from laning against him that his poke potential is insane. Even using champs such as teemo I was unable to equally trade back with him as he could dash in and dash out faster then the amount of damage I needed to do to him for an equal trade. Now a 1.33 second q is fine but having 0.1 seconds on a dash is allowing Yasuo too much free \"space\" to use at his will. Any fed Yas thrives in fighting multiple opponents/chasing down targets in lanes where he gets 7+ free dashes adding on the amount of opponents he is facing (which usually in a fed Yas matter is 3 or 4). Going even further by allowing him to dash every 0.1 seconds means Yasuo literally moves like the wind and can enter a fight quickly, execute a target, then dash out and maybe if he's lucky a minion wave will be coming and it's bye bye yas because he's outa there. Now most might think because he's squishy dashing into a fight all the time like that is risky but nevermind that anymore with Yas players just building tanky items entering in against 3 or 4 opponents is fine. \n\nTL;DR - Nerfing Yas Q could potentially ruin him, having a free dash on 0.1 seconds is giving him too much \"free space\". What I possibly suggest is simply to change his dash CD to be 0.5 seconds at all levels? I believe it would tone him down enough to be balanced since he would still have a good amount of mobility and his damage is still there.","replies":[]}]}
