I could be fine for hours without issue or I could have problems non stop. It varies so much, so why should I have to miss out on LoL because Leaver buster keeps pinging me. I think its unfair when I have no control on the situation and even the ISP don&#039;t know when the lines etc will be fixed or finished.\n\nIn my opinion unless someone actively reports me. i.e 2 people each game min for like 3 matches. I shouldn't be punished for something I cannot help. There is a difference between afk/quitting and losing connection all together!{{sticker:slayer-jinx-unamused}}","replies":[{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2017-09-20T06:23:50.528+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"You have to remember that even if you are not leaving intentionally you're still negatively affecting 9 other people's game. I know it's frustrating, especially when it's something beyond your control, but if you're getting leaver busted then it must be happening pretty consistently. \n\nAt the end of the day this is an online game, and while Riot does as much as they can to protect their players from issues like yours, in this case it's as beyond their control as it is yours, and they still have an obligation to protect those 9 other players from your issue, something that *is* within their power.\n\nIt sucks, but your choices here are to play with leaver buster penalties and simply find something else to do or play while you wait for the queue timer, or to only play when you know things are mostly stable. Either way you have to accept that your issue impacts other people's games, and that puts you at a disadvantage.","replies":[{"poster":"SillyDaBillie","date":"2017-09-20T06:41:04.063+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I understand what you are saying but when I play with friends who are more than aware of the issues and don't mind.
