It still takes the same amount of orange essence to buy/unlock things etc.\n\nHowever there will be a decrease in the amount of essence you get when you disenchant skin shards.\n\nSo yes, any skin shards you don't want to unlock _(or keep for re-rolling purposes)_, you would be better off disenchanting them now, before pre-season arrives.","replies":[{"poster":"sour mash","date":"2017-11-05T04:53:03.574+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"alright cheers mate","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"sour mash","date":"2017-11-05T03:41:11.719+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Link to the video\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0d1n5yVhWVg","replies":[]}]}
