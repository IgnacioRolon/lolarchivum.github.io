Great. -_-\n\n{{sticker:slayer-jinx-unamused}} \n\nI like the Guardian Angel changes though, Its supposed to be a second chance for ADC's, not a 1v5 item for tank/bruisers. These changes nudge it back in that direction a bit.\n\nReducing the crit reduction on Ranudins is stupid. Welcome back 100% ban rate Yasuo!\n\nGargoyles will get gutted the next patch after implementation (or before if we are lucky), tanky non-damage champs like Leona, Braum, Alistar, etc. just wont die. (and Zac with Iron elixir and Lulu's R will get HUGE)\n\nThe Dead mans change makes sense I suppose. Im not sure why it was needed, but it makes sense.\n\nThe Abyssal/Banshees change is kinda weird, its hard to see how the new items will feel. I can see why they did it. But its going do funny things with a lot of builds, and I think having HP on Abyssal will feel weird. Its making you choose between AP and Abyssal's passive. Which is a strange thing to do for an Item that was always more offensive than defensive. \n\nIn general it seems like Riot wants less HP items and more resistance items?","replies":[{"poster":"CHEESYLEEKS","date":"2017-04-07T13:02:00.098+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"im quite looking foward to the b veil change, i always though the passive cd was way to long.\n\ntank fizz is really gonna love the new abyssal {{sticker:slayer-jinx-unamused}} ","replies":[{"poster":"Lord Sesshomaru","date":"2017-04-07T23:07:35.724+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The passive on it does feel a bit long, especially in teamfights where you often have no idea what was blocked, and often doesn't make much difference anyway.
