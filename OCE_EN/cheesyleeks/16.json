Player 1 may have given first blood and had the enemy laner capitalize and snowball through a series of unlucky events, happens alot, then the other players on his team just trash talk him and bully him all game long. Player 1 realizes his whole team is toxic and genuinely doesnt want them to win, he sells his gear, gets boots and proceeds to feed.\n\nat the end of the game, he looks like the only bad party since he fell behind early, got trash talked and received no help all game. His team mates decide to further abuse him by making a forum post about how shit this player was, everyone bitter about feeders jumps on board out of context and proceeds to abuse him, next they add him in game and trash talk him because they feel justified\n\nDoes that sound fair?\n\nThis is why riot is reluctant to put the power of discipline into the players hands, i know if i was pulled up on the absolute worst parts of my 5 worst games, ever, players would ask for a permaban, and im a really positive player who avoids flaming and blaming and that would be one game in a thousand, it takes a lot for me to get to a point where i will be an asshole on purpose, ALOT!\nlike 4 players blaming everything on me after i have been ganked non-stop in a lane against a hard counter while having my lanes pushed and CS stolen levels of bullsh!t","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Requiemsfire","date":"2016-05-07T14:46:19.324+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"There's a slippery slope when it comes to these kinds of rules.

I like being able to add players to my blacklist, especially if they are known intent feeders or general toxic players.\n\nOn the other hand, the boards are brutal.

More often than not, they are wrong. People in bronze/silver/gold are usually in their elo for a reason. I mean, if naming and shaming were a thing, I probably would have hundreds of people QQing on the boards about my \"intent feeding\", when reality is that I just suck.","replies":[{"poster":"Vanilla Bread","date":"2016-05-07T15:02:26.364+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"int list*","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Main Line","date":"2016-05-08T09:52:48.431+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Naming and shaming would be rife if it were allowed. And in a lot of those cases, false accusations could be made. I think many sites on the internet do not want this situation to happen.\nWhat Riot could do better is have better support ticket options, like better categories. Of course, they want the least amount of reports to come in, because they will save money by not hiring people to deal with them, so this is why the support ticket options are quite vague.","replies":[]},{"poster":"MRhipposcottamus","date":"2016-05-08T06:59:20.154+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":".","replies":[]},{"poster":"Fitzky","date":"2016-05-07T13:40:26.037+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I agree","replies":[]},{"poster":"Roguestoney","date":"2016-05-07T13:33:48.743+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yes and no.\n\nThat is all.","replies":[]},{"poster":"AceAkali","date":"2016-05-07T19:31:56.302+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":7,"body":"RITO is such a noob, serious and you know why bcoz they r greedy, while banning tyler fkin 1 they announce his name in their website but not allow us to show the real Mthr Fker Toxic n trollers , RIOT days will come end soon I know it","replies":[]}]}
