Look at your win/loss ratio, its pretty bad (no offence). The system is basically telling you that you don't actually deserve to be in silver 5, because you aren't performing to the standards of this elo rank, thus the amount of wins to losses. The system is ranking you at around a bronze 1/bronze 2 level of player, due to the amount of losses compared to wins you have. However the system is also giving you a chance to improve while maintaining your place in silver, or whatever rank you may be, as it doesn't demote you completely. But by giving you less LP, its slowly pushing you back to 'where you belong' essentially. Its even the reverse for if you win more games than you lose. Say you're an incredibly good player, and your win to loss ratio is 70%, why do you deserve to be in silver 5 and take forever to climb ranks by only getting 20LP? Its saying you are good enough to be in say gold/platinum, and thus, wants to get you there quicker by giving you more LP. Im sorry mate, but if you to get more LP or a stable amount, you better start winning games, or getting that win/loss ratio to 50%.","replies":[{"poster":"CHEESYLEEKS","date":"2016-01-18T12:01:34.302+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Ok I got placed in silver 4 were I expected to get bronze 4/5 at the time and lost a lot of games in the beginning, now I'm doing rather well I've climbed back to silver 4 two times now and am playing rather decently.

FTW you are in pre-season... New season will refresh your stats meaning you wont be in elo hell... so relax and enjoy preseason until season starts which is tomorrow! Good day to you sir\n\nP.S - Maybe try to not let your wins go below your loses... cause then your mmr will start to go lower than the average mmr for your elo. Stay positive and win more games!\n\nAlso for future advice, it doesnt matter how many games you win... its the way you play. Your rank stats is one of the major issues that puts you into elo hell. Sure you may lose games but that doesnt ruin your mmr unless you lose many games in a row (like 10 games in a row). You have to remember that riot is trying to balance your games and mmr stats. Thus... if you dont do well, you will join the other players who dont do well.\n\nLike you need to get out of this ''I win soo many games and then lose a few that i go back to square one'' attitude. You need to win games and get good stats in order to return to your elo. Getting carried could be one way but your stats in game is the most important thing in order to keep climbing.
