(though they're often not very fun to lane against)\nHeimerdinger is a unique champion who excels at poking, sustaining, freezing, pushing, overextending, taking and most importantly creating sieges over objectives. He's fairly matchup reliant since champions that can clear his turrets safely counter a fair portion of his damage and he has trouble with extremely mobile champions who can dash through his turret's zones; but in good matchups it's hard to go wrong even with the jungler attempting to camp him because he is one of the strongest zone mages in the game. Heimerdinger is typically a toplaner with either a full ap (due to his high ap ratios and relative safety inside his turret zones once he has a zhonias) or tankpush build (due to his high base damage output from turrets) but he's also a fairly decent midlaner when build full ap (due to being able to outsustain alot of mid, keep them locked down in lane and poke them down with the high damage and range of ult w) until you hit high elo. His full ap build is strongest early-mid game with his ult w doing ridiculous amounts of damage and his tank push build is strongest hard into the lategame where his push power is hard to counter and his ult e can devastate teamfights but he doesn't spike as hard as other champion nor does he fall off as hard; so he's pretty consistent at all stages in the game. When picking the donger in ranked you'll optimally want to be facing someone with poor waveclear or a lack ranged poke. If the enemy is mobile you may want to consider rushing a zhonias. In terms of abilities you'll want to max your q turrets in most matchups and max your e stun bomb last. You'll want to take flash and either exhaust on full ap builds or tp on tankpush builds.\n \nHow you use these abilities is you'll put your turrets in generally a triangle formation with your front line of turrets running horizontal to your monitor with 2 in front and 1 behind you and as you push the lane down you'll move these up one at a time always saving turret charges in case a fight breaks out. Now alot of people will advise you to use your turrets to clear a jungle camp for an earlier level 2 than your laner since you can clear it without losing hp; I do not suggest this in any lane where the enemy can clear your turrets from range though since setting up your bermuda triangle of turrets is quite important to winning lane and screwing up the placement of your turrets and losing them to your enemy laner or minions early can lose you the lane even without you dying since you need to keep lane pressure as heimerdinger. In lane you'll want to have your turrets lining up just behind where you freeze your minions to counter any attempt to cs or aggression from the enemy laner or jungle ganks whilst you farm with your amazing 550 range smooth animation aa's; this is typically how you win laning phase, through intense cs denial, very easy passive farming and push power. Eventually alot of enemies will get fed up of being denied so much and having to face such a large cs difference and will try to all in you. This is why it is important to throw out your w every so often when the minion waves are eliminated to poke them down and stop them from being able to pull off a sucessful all-in. Focus the w just in front of your enemy laner for maximum damage and hit chance since spreading out your rockets does no damage, but also focusing them exactly on your opponent makes them easy to dodge and you'll still get 90% of the damage off if you focus the cursor about 12 (1.2 teemo widths) units in front of them. If you screwed up the turret placement, with your high base hp regen (2nd highest in the game I believe) it is often effective to draw the enemy minion wave, not tank it but attract minions aggro and then walk away to the side into a bush. This slows the enemy minions down giving yours time to get in position to defend the turrets and you'll only take a bit of damage from the caster minion which you can regen fairly quickly. \n\nHeimerdinger's rockets have one of the highest non-global ranges in the game, extending beyond the limits of your screen so if you can get wards in the bushes (don't use turrets as wards it's a bad idea) you can often poke them under their turret and they'll have no option but to forfeit the turret and go back. Don't place your turrets under enemy turrets, you'll lose them but you can set up your turrets just outside the tower range to melt any minions that try to push out allowing you to constantly have your minions forcing down the tower. You can also put your mega turret underneath a tower to force your enemy laner away from thew tower and force it down quickly but remember that you still need your safe zone of regular turrets if they decide to fight you after the mega one dies. If you need to push fast your rockets are effective, just try to spread them out a bit so they hit the whole wave and then just finish them off with aa's; don't bother setting turrets down when pushing hard, until you get to where you need to setup camp.\n\nWhen pushing and overextending, remember to have a zhonias and to save your ult and always have 3 turrets around you for safety. If 2 or 3 people come to fight you, run around in circles to dodge skillshots and avoid melee champions from getting close before circling in deep among your turrets and using exhaust on the squishiest of the people coming to kill you, using ult q, zhonias once they jump on you. This will often force them to run away and back and if not they will often die. If they stick around, your e is very strong cc, so use it on whoever still has enough hp to fight you and waddle away until your ult comes back up or your teammates come to help you push. As heimerdinger the proper definition of overextended is a little different from what it would be for any other champion since your 3 turrets combined do just about as much damage as a tower early-midgame and more damage than a tower lategame making you very hard to kill. Interesting strategies for heimerdinger is that if any all has the tp spell they can tp to your turrets making them invinvible and that you can use your turrets to tank and rush drakes, dragons and baron exceptionally fast and fairly early into the game. With a jungler with decent sustained damage, heimerdinger can safely take dragons at around lvl3 and can solo the dragons at lvl6 since your ult w does about as much damage as a smite would do at that point in the game (which also makes dragon and baron steals over the wall hilarious lategame since they do 1125 damage with no ap once both w and r are max rank and on a full ap build with 600ap that's 2475 damage and have a range of 1100 units making stealing baron fairly safe). As the donger you'll have to setup for teamfights since alot of your sustained damage comes from your turrets and you're very vulnerable without them since your e will take a bit of practice to land.\n\nAnyways I don't want to bore you and there is so much fun to be had playing this champion; the typical builds are:\n\nFull Ap {{champion:74}} {{summoner:4}} {{summoner:3}} \nCore {{item:3165}} {{item:3157}} {{item:3116}} {{item:3020}} \nWith options {{item:3151}} {{item:3135}} {{item:3001}} {{item:3089}} {{item:3152}}  depending on matchup and how much mr they build.\n\nFull Push {{champion:74}}  {{summoner:4}} {{summoner:12}} \n{{item:3060}} {{item:3512}} {{item:3157}} {{item:3111}} \nWith options {{item:3065}} {{item:3083}} {{item:3068}} {{item:3143}} {{item:3102}} {{item:3116}} {{item:3026}} depending on matchup\n\nYour runes should be quite standard for both with flat ap quints, magic pen reds, 9 scaling hp yellows, 3 flat mr and 6 scaling cdr blues.\nYou generally want to take 18-0-12 with deathfire grasp for full ap and 0-12-18 with grasp of the undying for the tank push build.\n\nI hope this helps but you'll probably discover alot more about the donger by playing him and find a few things for your own playstyle. It may also help to watch higher elo replays and look at some guides since this is just a quick summary. Anyways goodluck on the rift.","replies":[]}]}
