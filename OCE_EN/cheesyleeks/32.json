I do have a question though, would they continue it like a series such as warring kingdoms? I mean if orianna counts then it would be epic for all the ideas and possibilities of skins","replies":[{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2017-01-12T12:40:58.799+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yeah I can defs see the toy theme for blitz.

He's so adorable T^T\nThe ideas that come to mind are:\nAzir: Well he can be the king. Weapon -> needle ;') and his soldiers can be damaged/ruined toys. Maybe he could be the creator (just like Viktor with battlecast) of the whole chaos thing? His recall could be him building his soldier and bringing it back to life?\nRammus: Technically not really but imagine a dangerous ball of fluff rolling to you. Like i would hug dat D: Who wouldnt love to hug rammus >.< \nJinx: Well shes crazy so imagine just like a broken ass doll with like a button eye. Her W can be shooting something out of a hot glue gun? Her main gun i have no clue, my friend suggest yarn balls as E. Ulti - >an explosion of fluff :D. Recall -> mending something like a doll or toy but then rips it apart like nope :D\nZyra: Only thinking because of her plants?\nLulu: Because her w can transform enemies into certain things maybe she could be secretly evil!!!!!?? and perhaps be the creator.\nThresh: My friend suggested it but just imagine a him whipping people with thread ;')\nAnother idea by friend Syndra: Get smacked with like balls of cushion/yarn.

Just imagine a plush wolf head floating around, her firing needles. A broken button for her mark.
