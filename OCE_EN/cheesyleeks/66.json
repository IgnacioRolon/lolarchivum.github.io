My guess for the rework since they want Swain more like a tactician, is that he will have those sort of moves when human form and then when he becomes his bird form, he'll have some extra moves to go with it and it'll be more like a rage kit instead of tactician.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Lord Sesshomaru","date":"2017-08-17T20:30:53.855+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I agree, Swain like most old champs is just in need of a VU, not a rework.\n\nHe's strong _(maybe even too strong)_, he's unique, he has a niche that no other champ fills _(the only one that comes close is Vladimir)_.\n\nWith a new Vo and VU, he would have a clean new identity as Noxus' tactician. \nTheres no need to re-work what already works.\n\nPoppy\nSion\nYorick\nUrgot\nTaric\nWarwick\netc etc.\n\nare all played only 1 or 2% more than they were pre-rework.\nSo clearly, reworks are not the answer to champion popularity.\n\nI mean, swain could have a kit that makes him feel more like a 'tactician' rather than just a brainless \"miss everything, but just ult an win\" champ, but his kit works, and works well as a whole.\n\nIf we have to offer up a sacrifice to be reworked. Why not rework Mordekaiser? He's a terrible model, his kit is weird and confusing, no one in the world knows where he is supposed to go or what he is supposed to do. and the one place they try to force him to go _(ADC)_ he's shit.\n\nMeanwhile swain is pretty solidified in his role as top/mid lane bruiser.","replies":[{"poster":"CHEESYLEEKS","date":"2017-08-18T05:29:25.627+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"yeah they really fucked morde over tbh, he used to be good and i frequently played him.\n\ni need to just start playing the favorite spammed every game brainless as fuck champs that riot will never touch and be bored out of my skull ( {{champion:122}} {{champion:92}} {{champion:103}} {{champion:64}}{{champion:134}}   etc .... https://pbs.twimg.com/profile_images/650097282189148160/9l8eZ8nD.png )","replies":[]}]}]}
