For Yasuo at least the former is not the case.\n\nNo champion should have adc level damage, AND be difficult to kill.\n\nAlso I never said he wasn't a fighter, I said he was a damage dealer, which is true, he deals damage, and he takes up the position of the mid lane carry. (Which is almost always a damage position) so when In a team, he composes much of the damage. \n\nNo it's not your fault that people build assassin, but it's also not your fault that people use guns to kill eachother when they aren't supposed to, should we not have gun laws just because a guns primary role is not to go into schools and kill everyone?\n\nSarcasm only makes sense if it relates to the point you are making, yours had no point at all.\n\nWhat it all boils down to in he end, is that more people will agree with me that Yasuo is unbalanced, than will agree with you. You are fighting a losing battle.\n\nEveryone on the boards (probably riot included) just knows that you're only defending yasuo because he's your little pet champ and you want to feel special playing him, but you can't because everyone else also plays him.

Im just stating facts, they are just crap. Only ever seen 4 good yasuo's in my life, rest fed their tiny little asses off thinking they were playing the easy op champ, he is like riven, mechanics get you fed, if you get fed you need to rely less on those mechanics, but in the end its still the mechanics, only difference is riven outclasses him in nearly every area.\n\nDon't worry, humans are naturally stupid creatures with a need of violence, you can't help it.
