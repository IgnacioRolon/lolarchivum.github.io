If he is stupid enough to aa you a few times, he will take some damage from your minions as well as you if you turn on him while he is getting hit by minions. Of course it depends on machup though. Darius will always be a lane bully, just like Renekton. Both can be countered by staying away and praying that they don't freeze the lane so you cqn farm undor tower. Often times if I am playing a weak early game champion like Nasus or Tryndamere, I will take the Bounty mastery just to get some gold income while I am out of melee range.","replies":[]}]}
