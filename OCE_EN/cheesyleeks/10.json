He's due for nerfs soon.\n\n+ {{champion:29}} **Twitch** struggles against the popular ADC's right now, such as **Lucian** and **Corki**. But he's considered by his player base to be hidden OP. He melts tanks and is the best teamfight ADC in the game. He can single-handedly turn fights in the late game.\n\nIf you think you can outplay aggressive ADC's and assassins right now, then definitely go **Twitch**. Otherwise, **Corki** is the safe pick.","replies":[]},{"poster":"SephirothSG","date":"2016-02-14T04:22:40.077+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Corki for sure.","replies":[]},{"poster":"TrashDonnut","date":"2016-02-14T04:20:48.724+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"{{champion:42}} \n\n100%, no doubt.\n\nPhreak approved(ish).","replies":[]}]}
