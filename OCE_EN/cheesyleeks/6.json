But knowing Riot, they would do almost nothing for Zed as they are probably too busy designing another fking skin for Ekko.","replies":[{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2016-08-21T17:58:17.498+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Ekko only has three skins so I'm very confused as to why it's such a big deal. PROJECT: Zed was only end of last year, which for a roster of 132 (by my last count) champions really isn't that long ago. There are boatloads of champions who haven't had a skin in much longer and don't have all that many (Quinn is a personal fav of mine with only 3 skins). There are arguments against Kat getting a PROJECT skin (I'm all for due creative process but she really seems to get one most major events) but Ekko? \n\nArt isn't something you can just magic out of nothing because someone told you to. The limitations of their tech in 2012 may also mean that making skins for Zed is much harder than for Ekko and therefore takes more time and resources. They have multiple skins in dev at any one time, which one we see first is whichever one makes it through the process first, and doesn't mean x other champ doesn't have a skin in dev.","replies":[{"poster":"Erøse","date":"2016-08-23T07:07:16.909+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Ekko gets a skin in less than a year?
