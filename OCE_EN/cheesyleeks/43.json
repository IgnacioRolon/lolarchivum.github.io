But I'm not sold on trying new champs in ranked without some experience on them first, _(out of courtesy to your team at the very least)_.\n\n___________\n\nBut ranked is just a huge slog for me, I hate it!\nand it certainly doesn't help that my champion pool is limited so hard in ranked by my desire to win.\n\nI have 41 champs between mastery 4 and 7 (17 of which are lvl 6 and 7).\nBut In ranked out of all those, I play almost exclusively Taliyah and Shen..\n\nOccasionally if the stars align, if I'm LAST pick, and if I can see the enemy has minimal disruption _(and no Zac)_, ill Pick Aurelion Sol. But it's basically suicide to pick him otherwise.\n\nSometimes ill pick Azir or Yorick, if the situation calls for them. and obviously ill pick around both my team and the enemy of course.\nBut Taliyah, Shen and Sol's roam is just too valuable to give up, so very often they are my best option at keeping bot lane alive, and thus having the best chance at winning the game.\n\n\nI live for the day when I can play Kindred, but with the distinct lack of tanks, and the jungle infested with champs like Lee and Kha, Kindred is a 1-way ticket to B5 :(\n\nI want to play champs like Azir and Karthus and stuff more in ranked, because I love them and i'm good with them. But the reward you get for playing them just isn't worth the risk you take when playing them into 80% of the popular mid lane champs.\nE.g. why put 3x effort into playing Azir when you could get virtually the same result playing someone like Fizz without even trying.\n\nSo yea, I definitely prefer normals where I can play any champ I want and just focus on my own playing rather than winning. xD\n\nCongrats on your success with Gallo!","replies":[{"poster":"CHEESYLEEKS","date":"2017-08-04T02:15:22.343+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"yeah i had the same problem were i would just play my main pool only i lost  i dont know how many games but went from 92lp b2 to 40 lp bronze 4 in a week and wasn't really having fun.\n\nso i was like \"i wanna play velkoz this game or i wanna play full ap swain instead of going to tanky or ive never played reworked galio outside of aram/mucking around in customs but i like his kit (especially his ult,its fun as fuck) and im only losing most of my games so why not just have a go.\" might play some brand mid tonight.\n\nits very refreshing. i would play normals but the only reason i play ranked is because i absolutely loath role calling in chat and would rather just get what roles i want to play 85% of the time.","replies":[]}]}]}
