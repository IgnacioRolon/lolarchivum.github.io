The current description of Morgana's W is:\n\n> Morgana infects the target area for 5 seconds, causing enemies who stand on the location to take magic damage every half second, increased by (0.5% for every 1% of target's missing health).\n\nSo if we break this apart in the scenario that the only spell or auto attack from Morgana that is hitting you is her W, you would have to be standing in the effected area for 1.5 seconds in total. (Taking one \"Tick\" towards Thunderlords every half a second towards the max of 3 when it procs.)\n\nFor me, when I think about it this way, there is a sense of counter-play that you are able to move out or use a movement ability to get out of the Tormented Soil before the Thunderlords procs.\n\n---\n\nNow in contrast if we were to look at an ability that does flat out damage over time where it sticks to the target, there would be no way to stop that Thunderlords from procing. This might become frustrating to players that they just take this Thunderlords proc from what seems like for a reason they shouldn't.\n\n---\n\nHope this helps to clarify on the reasoning behind why I think this might be the case.\n\n~Elam","replies":[{"poster":"Lord Sesshomaru","date":"2017-04-05T13:10:15.646+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hi Elam, great explanation!\n\nI Just have a few questions. \nWhile Morgana's pool takes a decent amount of time to activate thunderlords, there are varied tick timers over many different abilities, \nother abilities might have a quicker tick timer and still proc thunderlords. \nMany are large enough that leaving the area before thunderlords goes off is near impossible. What counterplay is there for that?\n\nMy other question is: \nWhy do on-hit effects count as another source of damage in terms of thunderlords?\n\nFor example, Lux's passive.\nIf as lux, you land your E on someone, damaging them with the explosion, and then auto attack them, Thunderlords goes off. \nI understand that there is 3 types of damage happing (E, Auto, Passive) but you have essentially only launched and landed 2 damaging effects.\nall other champions would still need a 3rd spell or auto to hit. She only needs 2.\nWhich leaves very little room for counterplay. \n\nWhy do you think is this the case?","replies":[{"poster":"Captain Fortune","date":"2017-04-06T01:22:54.433+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"**Greetings Lord Sesshomaru,**\n\nThis is actually a very difficult question to answer with a concrete answer basically saying \"This is why\". If I was the case that I could sit down with one of the Rioters in charge of this stuff I am sure I could get a specific answer. However what I can do is thoery craft behind why this might be.\n\n---\n\n**Quicker Tick Abilities**\n\nNow you mentioned other abilities that have tick timers that are much quicker and still proc Thunderlords. I can see the frustration that it doesn't seem like there is a lot of counter-play, but I think that this would come down to the fact of what types of abilities are allowed to proc it and being **consistent** or **\"fair\"** between all of them. \n\nWhen you think about it, if you had a damage spell like Morgana's W in the way it ticks even if it is faster your brain would naturally think, this should proc Thunderlords because I know it works with X. This would lead to a heavy amount of confusion if it was the case that it didn't. It might also lead to players complaining that X ability is too weak because it doesn't proc Thunderlords when it feels like it really should.\n\nWith this in mind Riot I think has created a bit of a **\"Standard\"** so when thinking about what kind of ability it is, your brain can immediately jump to, yes this will proc Thunderlords. \n\n---\n\n**Lux**\n\nSpecifically to comment on the fact of Lux passive, this also ties into what is said above about the \"Standard\" of what does and doesn't proc Thunderlords. When you think about the _current_ description of the mastery it says.\n\n> Hitting an enemy champion with an **ability (ability damage) or basic attack (on-hit)** marks them with Thunderlord's Decree for 3 seconds. At 3 stacks, the target is dealt 10 - 180 (based on level) + (30% bonus AD) + (10% AP) magic damage in an area around them. Thunderlord's Decree can only be triggered once every 25 - 15 (based on level) seconds.\n\nNow thinking about this, when you think about it for Lux passive to not give an extra stack towards Thunderlords it would have to either:\n\n1. Disobey the description of what the mastery does which would lead to a ton of confusion on the community, which Riot doesn't want. (Always wanting visual clarity and etc.)\n\n2. Have an after note specifically just for Lux saying that it wouldn't work with her passive.\n\nThis helps with both visual and gameplay consistency with what the description of things are. \n\n---\n\n**MOAR Lux**\n\nTo keep going with this another thing is to think about the fact that Lux's passive technically does count as a damaging effect. So in a sense you do still have the 3 things towards Thunderlords. (The E, Then the auto attack damage, then the passive damage.)\n\nOverall though, I am sure that this is something that Riot is aware of, and in a sense even though the fact remains that Lux in a sense has less actions towards procing Thunderlords visually, this is accounted for when they do balance her, so it works out in the end.\n\n_Also as a side note, do keep in mind technically when using her E as an Example, you still do have to do 3 actions, in the sense of: Throwing the E > Exploding the E > Then auto attacking. **Plus** she does have a sheild, so that is only 3 of her 4 spells that can add towards Thunderlords, just something to consider._\n\n---\n\nWithout going into so much detail that makes many people's brain hurt, I hope that this helps to give a bit of clarity towards why this might be the case. Do you think this makes sense and fits in with why Riot may have made the choice to go down this path with how Thunderlords works?\n\nLet me know what you think.\n\n~Elam","replies":[{"poster":"Lord Sesshomaru","date":"2017-04-06T03:17:06.978+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey Elam, thanks for the reply!\n\nSorry my reply is so long :S _(section 3 is the most interesting part anyway)_\n\nEverything you say makes sense of course.\nAnd I fully understand the reason for making abilities with consistent logic (without consistency we just get chaos). But there are abilities the rules must apply to for consistency, but because the rule must applies to them (in some cases where it shouldn't in order to be 'fair') it gives the ability a bit of (often under the radar) extra strength.\n\nAn example I would use would be Nasus's Spirit Fire.\nObviously Thunderlords isn't a mastery that most Nasus players would take, but in terms of this hypothetical situation, lets pretend they are going AP Nasus. \nI dont have the exact numbers, but Im guessing that its tick rate would be similar to that of Morgana's. However the area is far larger, and not only that, but it deals initial impact damage as well, meaning it only needs 2 extra ticks in order to proc thunderlords. So if Nasus aims it right (with you in the centre), unless you are Master Yi or Rammus in full swing, it would be virtually impossible to escape the area without taking thunderlords damage.\n\nNow I'm not saying that this is a problem! far from it, it's rather a tiny issue, I'm just saying it has the potential to be frustrating for players, seeming many other champions (Xerath, Azir, Zilean, LeBlanc etc. have to work 3 times as hard (and 3 times the mana) to get the same extra damage off.)\n\n__________\n\n\nAs for Lux, its not a huge issue either, (if a lux has gotten an E and an auto off, chances are she has already hit you with at least something else as anyway.) But it is a shame that the easy, and often considered very powerful champions like Lux, just happen by chance (due to their kit) to have this extra convenience, when they do already have a lot going for them anyway.\n\nFor clarity's sake, you say that if on hit effects (using Lux's passive again as an example) were not to proc thunderlords, then they would have to either:\n\n1. Disobey the rules of thunderlords. _(which is against clarity)_\n2. OR have a special case by case exemption _(which is a pain because then you start making rules specific to every champion, and no one can remember them all.)_ \n\nHowever, Single target DoT spells (as discussed in this thread) ARE exempt from thunderlords proc. But it states neither in the rules for thunderlords, nor in the description of champions like Malazhar or Fiddlesticks with DoT abilities. That DoT abilities are exempt from the rule.\n\nMeaning, either it's a bug and they are intended to proc thunderlords _(unlikely because like you say, wheres the counterplay)_. \nOR they were deemed by Riot to be unfair, and excluded without written exemption in the description. (which is confusing and has no clarity.)\n\nSo obviously, things are excluded, wether they are stated that way or not. and so if exemptions can be made with one type of ability without the need for explanation. Why shouldn't exemptions be made for others that follow a similar problem?\n\n___________\n\nIf on-hit effects like Lux's passive, count as another damage source for thunderlords, then what is to stop a champion (for example Twisted Fate) stacking them up for an instant thunderlords.\n\nImagine Twisted Fate, he has his Blue card up, and his E fully stacked. He then auto's, in theory he should proc thunderlords straight away. (auto attack damage, blue card damage, E damage.) Which would leave little-to-no counterplay for an opponent.\n\nIt doesn't work _(i just tested it)_. You still need to auto attack 2 extra times to proc thunderlords (3 auto, 2 abilities in total).\nWhich leaves the question, why does Lux's passive count as an extra source of damage for thunderlords, but neither Twisted Fate's W or E do?\n\n\nSo in general, I do see the logic behind Riot's decisions, and its clear that the decisions they make are more often than not, beneficial for the health and clarity of the game. But there are discrepancies (like why DoT are excempt without explanation, but on-hit effects aren't, and why Lux's AA effects act differently to Twisted Fate's.) Things that are confusing and lack clarity.\n\nand don't get me wrong, I don't think this is an issue, maybe its a little annoying for champs VSing lux or some others in early laning phase. But in terms of problems that need addressing, this is incredibly minor, (if it is indeed a problem at all).\n\nMy only argument is with the discrepancies of how thunderlords reacts with different abilities.\n\nWow this wasn't intended to be this long O_O sorry haha. xD","replies":[{"poster":"Captain Fortune","date":"2017-04-06T04:08:52.307+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I see what you are saying, let me try to comment on a few things with a bit more clarity with the points that you have brought up, correct me if I am getting anything wrong here.\n\n---\n\n**Single Target DOT Spells**\n\nNow you mentioned in here that spells such as Malzhar's DOT do not proc Thunderlords, and my argument towards this would be what part of the description specifically states that DOT abilities work in this way? Looking at the description:\n\n> **Hitting*** an enemy champion with an ability (ability damage) or basic attack (on-hit) marks them with Thunderlord's Decree for 3 seconds. At 3 stacks, the target is dealt 10 - 180 (based on level) + (30% bonus AD) + (10% AP) magic damage in an area around them. Thunderlord's Decree can only be triggered once every 25 - 15 (based on level) seconds.\n\nKey word here being hitting. So why this works well for Morgana's pool for example is that it is avoidable. Other abilities you have to cast it and \"hit\" your opponent with it, same with autos. However targetable DOTs are not, hence the hitting part. So that is why I think that only the first tick of \"point and click\" DOTs count towards Thunderlords. That and counterplay.\n\nIf I am missing a single target DOT that does proc Thunderlords, thus breaking this rule, let me know.\n\n---\n\n**Twisted Fate**\n\nAlright so this is where things get really confusing and where I have to make sure I phrase my sentences in the correct way to convey the correct message.\n\nNow when I think of Twisted Fate's E, it is something that **Empowers** Twisted Fate's auto attack, as opposed to adding on another source of damage. For another example, Zed's passive **Empowers** his auto attack vs targets that are low enough HP.\n\nIn contrast we look at Lux's passive, and her passive \"Marks\" the enemy champion letting her proc the mark with an auto attack or her ult. In doing this it is not powering up her auto attack, but it is adding another source in damage of that mark procing. This is where I think the difference is and why this adds stacks to Thunderlords whereas others don't. \n\n_A similar example that may make it more clear is thinking about the way that Akali's Q works. She marks the target, then she can then proc the mark over the next few second for another source of damage._\n\n---\n\nI really hope this made English xD Let me know what you think!\n\n~Elam","replies":[{"poster":"Captain Fortune","date":"2017-04-06T04:34:39.085+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Secondary point on this, just got linked this and it explains pretty much exactly what we are talking about:\n\nhttps://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/gameplay-balance/XhPEjuQM-varus-thunderlords-vs-lux-thunderlords?comment=0016\n\nTurns out we are way over thinking this xD","replies":[{"poster":"Lord Sesshomaru","date":"2017-04-06T05:22:46.680+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Ahh ok now that you point out the wording \"Hitting\" that makes a lot more sense.\n\nand that distinction between empowering and marking does too.\n_(Im guessing Leona's passive would act like Lux's, while Twisted's would act like Kassadin's W and not proc thunderlords.)_\nalthough I don't see why they should be treated separately, as they both add another source of damage that would otherwise be absent.
