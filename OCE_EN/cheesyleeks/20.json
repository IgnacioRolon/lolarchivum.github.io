I find that half the stuff I dominate with in normals turns out to be complete trash in ranked.\n\nThis is probably because most players in normals will give away free kills for no reason, because they aren't concentrating or simply just don't care. This means that champions or builds which can snowball really hard are good for normals, but might not be so great in ranked.\n\nYou shouldn't worry about how well your going to do, you should worry about the all the shit your going to get in chat for simply playing ap nasus. People are just so toxic in ranked :/","replies":[]},{"poster":"Spiritofryu","date":"2017-01-02T13:11:54.169+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The problem with AP Nasus, is that you do a lot of damage with your E, then you're worthless until its off cooldown., you cant tank enough damage to make his ults damage useful, you get melted instantly. go for it, its still early into the season.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Knuuckles","date":"2017-01-02T11:27:56.113+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It's worth a shot but you will probably kneecap your teams damage because people think only ap champs go mid","replies":[]}]}
