Luckily for you, your career doesn't depend on getting off tilt, so you can take it casually. \n\nHere's what I think might help:\n\n+ **Take a break for a bit.**\n Maybe go only ARAM or normals for a while, or take a complete break from the game for about a week. Only come back to ranked when your attitude is good, if you're finding yourself going;\n\n _\"I can't win with this player\"_\n_\"Top got too fed gg\"_\n_\"How is this team so bad...\"_\n\n Then you're not ready for ranked.\n\n+ **Focus on improving, not winning.**\n Winning doesn't get you anywhere in the long-run. If you win heaps of games but don't improve, you'll just drop back to your original rank after you climb for a bit.\n\n The focus needs to be on improving. Play back your replays and analyse them, you'll notice that as a spectator you can look at your play more critically to find mistakes. Use [OP.GG](http://oce.op.gg/summoner/userName=CHEESYLEEKS) and [replay.gg](http://www.replay.gg/) to get your replays. \n\n If you want more help on replay analysis look for a guy on the forums called **Yasei Doubutsu**, he does great bronze gameplay analysis. I follow him closely, and the tips he gives are more than enough to get you into silver.\n\n Here's a link to his analysis series [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bc1tFkCS66U&list=PLyCEt27AsZuvNu0RQiCwgV2j3tR4foqvI&index=12).\n\n+ **Find some friends.**\n I don't know how you've made it this far without friends to be honest, but you need to find some. Even just casual friends you can fall back on for some normals after a bit of a ranked loss streak.\n\n If you see someone with a good attitude in-game, try and add them, see if you can play a few more matches together. Or add some players who carried you in a game, see if they can help you improve.\n\n+ **Look to the streamers.**\n Find some streamers/youtubers with a positive attitude (not Gross Gore). I'd personally recommend [gbay99](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rAsU0e_VVz0). You should be able to learn a bit from them, hopefully their good attitude will rub off a bit on you.\n\nI hope this helps.","replies":[{"poster":"Tele","date":"2016-03-27T20:55:15.800+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Oh, I forgot to add, if you're dead-set on leaving League, then I'd recommend trying [Arena of Fate](https://www.arenaoffate.com/) for PC or [Vainglory](http://www.vainglorygame.com/) for tablet.

That's because the objective of the game is to** kill the nexus**, not other champions, minions or even turrets (technically).\n\n\n> The current state of rank at low levels is just a joke, that is all it is, from the players who have ZERO idea how to play the game, let alone do better than shit in ranked, to those who blatantly give no shits and only want to play that specific champion regardless of anything, the rank system at low levels is not working.\n\nI'm not surprised ahah, it's low elo after all right? Of course the players will be inexperienced and make poor decisions.\n\nIf anything I'd say the ranked system is working perfectly. The low elo players are in low elo. If these people were playing against challenger players, then we would have a problem.","replies":[{"poster":"CookieButtLav","date":"2016-03-29T09:03:10.822+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> If anything I'd say the ranked system is working perfectly.

Teamwork is nessesary to win.\n\n> I have had games with the most stats period across the board, including assists, showing that I was in fact playing with the team and trying my best to help them, but lost. Why? You figure this out, most damage done AND taken along with least deaths.\n\nI stated before that KDA or stats doesn't win you games. You need to dispel the notion that it does.\n\nThere's many reasons as to why you lost. Maybe you; only went for kills? Didn't get the team to be proactive? Were not dynamic enough? Didn't address strong enemy players while they were manageable?\n\n+ Sometimes you will get games where you played really well, but you got unlucky and your team was tilted or not as good as the enemy. Other times you'll get games were someone just carries for you, or the enemy is really bad and it feels like a bot game.\n\n In the long run it balances itself out. \n\n In fact, assuming** you're not the problem** you have a 44% chance of getting a troll or noob player, while the enemy has a 56% chance. The chances are even lower for you to get 2 bad players.\n\nI'd recommend watching gbay99's video on this.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5MTO2a7ZFcc\n\nI hope this cleared any misunderstandings.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"CHEESYLEEKS","date":"2016-03-28T02:54:52.025+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":" @ gbays first reply.i agree that a player based lp gain system would be good, especially at bronze/silver if your losing because of a troll,feeder or an afk it might give you and the rest of your team incentive to have a good crack instead of ... \"gg 4v5\" or \"x is trolling, this games over\" or \"teams bad, afk at base\", instead of someone getting fed and everyone giving up within 10 minutes calling to surrender, people might actually have a go and be able to pull off a comeback.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"CHEESYLEEKS","date":"2016-03-27T22:49:47.580+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Cheers for the advice dude might take a few weeks break and try some others out.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Sha4o4","date":"2016-03-28T07:16:43.237+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"was on tilt and was s3 now b3 Tilt LvL unpredictable {{item:3070}}","replies":[{"poster":"CHEESYLEEKS","date":"2016-03-28T07:27:42.186+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"feelsbadman{{item:3070}}","replies":[{"poster":"Sha4o4","date":"2016-03-29T04:36:31.458+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"B2 now hope I can come out of hell {{item:3070}}","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Yasei Doubutsu","date":"2016-03-28T03:35:54.831+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yeah all you can do is play some other games and take a break.\nAlso I think you wanted to join the \"Helping Others Improve\"\nBut I forgot to send a request, as I just can't send you one without being your friend (Which is kinda silly)\nIm uploading atm, but let me Re-know if you wanted to join that.","replies":[{"poster":"CHEESYLEEKS","date":"2016-03-28T04:50:54.247+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"yeah man if i come back in a few weeks id like to join ;)","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"andyMak","date":"2016-03-28T02:46:58.456+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Smite has 1 v1 ranked mode :)\n\nalso heroes of the storm, it is different, there is no feeding really because the team levels\nso i hear , i dont play it because im not much of a blizzard fan boy and dont really like the game","replies":[{"poster":"CHEESYLEEKS","date":"2016-03-28T02:53:22.873+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"yeah ive looked at some vids on smite and plan to give it a go","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"atroquinine","date":"2016-03-27T18:21:06.378+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"SC2","replies":[{"poster":"CHEESYLEEKS","date":"2016-03-28T02:53:01.849+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"wouldnt this be classed as an rts?","replies":[]}]}]}
