The main reason for rushing zeal is when they are forced out of lane before getting enough gold for a BF, although i have no idea why people buy zeal as first item in full when they could have got a bf and zeal components instead of just zeal. seriously, who gets zeal on jhin when can afford a bf and if not a bf the long swords or pick to make into a bf item... zeal and its full items have no effect for him until ~25 min, 30% crit and 13 damage is far outweighed by the 144 ad and 20% crit you get from a bf crit item.","replies":[]},{"poster":"CHEESYLEEKS","date":"2017-01-02T03:20:37.714+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Basically to proc headshot quick as fuck","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"BarryButcher","date":"2017-01-02T01:57:08.923+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Depends what ADC i guess.

As **Klavinmour** noted this is most likely due to the popularity of the Item Runaan's Hurricane. While I do agree with your points that BF sword certainly can be a lot stronger in lane when rushed first over a Zeal, there can be reasoning behind why they would go Zeal first.\n\nFor example sometimes when I am forced to back early before I have the gold to buy a BF sword, often I will pick up the components of a Zeal on characters that I was going to get a Runaan's on anyway. This lets me spend goal into items that I am going to buy later, while giving me a small power spike when going back into lane, as opposed to buying more Doran's Blades or a Cull. \n\n---\n\nI think that another reasoning behind this is Runaan's has a lot of visual power. What I mean by this is when you buy a Runaan's it makes every auto attack shoot out up to three bullets, this gives the feeling of intimidate power for your champion that you bought that you can very easily see the effects of. While in a sense buying a BF sword does give you a lot more damage, Runaan's with its visual effect can often make you feel more power when buying it compared to other items. (Its three auto attacks, per auto attack.)\n\n---\n\nHowever you do have a good point though of BF sword being a stronger item over Zeal component wise on most champions. This can make your laning phase a lot weaker in a sense, but it also helps you hit your power spike of that Runaan's of champions such as Jinx that much sooner. A Jinx that gets resets early on in the game with a Runaan's can be a truly scary sight to see. Plus it works quite well with the Rocket Form of her Q making her AOE reach even further and letting her pick up resets even easier. Has some good wave clear advantages as well.\n\n---\n\nWhat are your thoughts on Visual power vs Flat out damage in this game, have you seen this effect what items you buy yourself? Another example would be Hydra with its auto attack passive, that item feels amazing to use. Let me know what you think because I am curious what your thoughts are!\n\nGood luck in your games and if there are any other questions I can answer let me know!\n\n~Elam","replies":[]}]}
