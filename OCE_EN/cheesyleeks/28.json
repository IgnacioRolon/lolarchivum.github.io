Final edit including extensive lore and artwork coming at a later date, so if some cuck comments on grammar i wont respond, although criticism about the actual champion concept very welcome.","replies":[{"poster":"Optus NBN","date":"2016-03-11T22:46:12.341+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hi","replies":[{"poster":"CHEESYLEEKS","date":"2016-03-12T00:56:23.188+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hello","replies":[]}]}]}
