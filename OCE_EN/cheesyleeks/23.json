Many years had passed and he had wandered, looking for something, anything that would help. he accidently stumbled into an explorers house one day while wandering through and overheard him an another person talking about an expedition to the void and that they had found a doorway to it.he was intrigued so he waited for days then followed them.\nAfter many months of searching the explorers finally found the ancient door they had read about and travelled into the void,exarc followed,although they didn&rsquo;t know it he and the explorers were being watched.he immediately become overwhelmed with power and transformed into a wraith, smiled at the explorers as turned around in shear terror then ripped them to pieces.He went back through the door and enacted his first act of revenge, slaying one of his betrayers whole bloodline, but after a while the power of the void wore off and he transformed back into a ghost unable to do anything once more\n\nHe had a way now and was hungry for more revenge he went back through the gate and once more transformed, but this time he was met with a figure.&rdquo;I cant allow this&rdquo; the figure said, the figure threw his old set of armour at the wraiths feet.&rdquo;these shall be your undoing,these are your ties to the world  and will help me imprison you for eternity&rdquo;.
