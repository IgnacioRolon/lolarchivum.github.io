It asked whether players would play Dynamic queue or Solo queue. [40% of the people in the poll](http://www.strawpoll.me/6583984/r) said they would play Dynamic queue. And that's not taking into account casual players who are far less likely to be in League forums where this was shared.\n\nBut even the fact that Flex queue exists is proof enough that many many players enjoy team play more than solo.
