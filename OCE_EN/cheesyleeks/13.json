Agree on times when they perform minimal online activities so you can play without interruption, and grant them the same courtesy.","replies":[{"poster":"Yasei Doubutsu","date":"2016-11-02T00:39:54.622+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"So report awaaaay!","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Garen Player","date":"2016-11-02T04:50:53.277+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I know how you feel i suffer like you do xD but its life","replies":[]},{"poster":"Wess","date":"2016-11-02T01:16:44.679+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I had bad internet for ages, so I queued up for AI because it was less likely to affect the team heavily if I did drop or disconnected for ages.
