Im so lost now with 'enchanter' and 'warden' and all the other new sub-sub-classes)_\nBut all cording to their Roadmap, the next champion is scheduled to be a Vanguard.\n\nIt all just confuses me, it seems like whenever a champ does too much damage or has too much CC for the class there supposed to be, rather than nerfing them, they just slap them with a new class name and pretend its not OP.\nIll just stick with _\"Tank, Fighter, ADC, Mage, Assassin, Support\"_ thanks ^^\n\n_____\n\nBut yea nah, the Freljord is an interesting place, and I'm pretty sure the last champ we had from there was Gnar, and that was a long time ago, so it'll be cool to see a brand new Freljord champ. \n\nIt'll be cool if he is some kind of Drawf-smith, or perhaps a Thor-like figure, as both are predominant 'godly' figures in norse mythology. Although that's what id _expect_, and recently Riot has been making such interesting champs that no one could foresee, like Xayah and Rakan. \n\nIt'll be interesting. ^^","replies":[]}]}
