Hit them with a Q (through your E gate), then W for three quick auto attacks. They'll either engage or run, but if you connect you should have chunked them down a fair bit.\n\nIf they engage, switch to hammer stance, hit them with From the Skies, get your W field up, couple of AAs and use Ignite if you got it (though I tend to take TP in top lane). You can follow that up with E but use it carefully, if you hit them away from you then you're basically gifting them a low health disengage and short changing yourself a kill.\n\nIn terms of build - standard attack damage marks/quints, armor seals - but I take mana regen glyphs (most take magic resist). Just find he's a bit mana hungry early.\n\nItem-wise I prioritise Manamune, Essence Reaver & Frozen Heart. Manamune is first item, next two are situational, depending on lane opponent, whether you're ahead or behind, team composition, etc. Boots are situational too.\n\nEnd game, any combination of Lord Dominik / Infinity Edge / Trinity Force / Bloodthirster. Again, swap one out for armor if your team needs the tankiness. \n\nI'm not a ranked Jayce player but he seems to be pretty underused on OCE which gives you the advantage of opponents not knowing how to play against him.","replies":[{"poster":"Crunch","date":"2016-05-17T05:33:44.111+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You've definitely got some great tips in there, but I'll add a couple of small points onto it for OP!\n\n1. Your AttackSpeed Steroid from your Cannon Form's W remains even after changing forms. This is extremely useful for the fact that you can swiflty do 3 autos in melee form to regain your mana when trading. It can come as a huge surprise to many players as they may continue to trade assuming you won't have any mana to followup with.\n\n2. Spam your ultimate to change forms when running around the map (such as to lane/roaming or running away from enemies.) The Speed boost aspect of changing forms comes in handy and is very underrated. Especially in combination with the Hypercharge W and (Q) To the Skies to gapclose onto them, apply a slow and get 3 autos off as opposed to trying to hit from max range in cannon form. \n\n3. Jayce scales amazingly with Attack Damage, as a lot of his damage can be output with quick animation cancelling combos for huge burst. Because of this, armor penetration is a MUST for your AD to stay relevant in the mid-late game, otherwise your Shock Blast + Gate combo will just be eaten up by the enemy tankline.","replies":[]},{"poster":"CHEESYLEEKS","date":"2016-05-10T01:58:34.748+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"yeah ive vsed him once since i started playing and have seen him played like 3 or 4 times. seems to be a common theme with mana dependent champions.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Socon","date":"2016-05-12T03:10:08.533+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"A lot of people don't know this but AA in hammer stance gives you mana.","replies":[{"poster":"CHEESYLEEKS","date":"2016-05-12T03:32:29.471+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"10 per auto","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"GigaPube","date":"2016-05-10T22:16:48.086+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"i dont know how tryhard you are about champions and their skill level/ceiling/cap/potential/etc. but dont expect to ever be able to grasp jayce anywhere near the way he should be played optimally, let alone during the free week. there is way too many possibilities of playing him. hes like a game of chess, sure theres a lot of different things to do, and you can do some things well and play a lot better during various times of the game. but to truly be able to be \"good\", all you can do is learn and practice, and be smart enough to make your own decisions, the right decisions, when it really counts, and if you cant play the best that you want to, or can, then play a different game, or champion, or whatever, i dont care m8","replies":[{"poster":"CHEESYLEEKS","date":"2016-05-11T00:27:20.341+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"i will, i own jayce thx to hextech crafting and i want to get into him as i like the style of play/massive kit. also jayce a tryhard champ? cmon hes not even close to being in the same teir as {{champion:105}} {{champion:238}} {{champion:157}} {{champion:103}} {{champion:92}} \n\nive played him twice in normals and went positive both times and got a triple kill on the second game with rubbish builds and barely knowing what i was doing, hence asking for advice on the best build / way to iniate in other jayce mains/players opinions.","replies":[]}]}]}
