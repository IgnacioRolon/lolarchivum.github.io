People would also probably complain about the amount of time it takes to get through the champ select, especially when you want a quick game (although anyone that starts a game with \"ff@20 because school\" should reevaluate their life choices). \n\nThe choice to open up the queue is evaluated on a regular basis, and hopefully eventually our server will have a population deemed \"healthy\" enough to have the same queue options as our NA and EU friends :D","replies":[{"poster":"CHEESYLEEKS","date":"2016-09-27T05:11:15.675+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I hope so.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"bgentle2myashe","date":"2016-09-27T05:21:57.656+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yeah I have that problem too. As the lobby opens I get a slight lag so I can't enter my role in time. Also, in norms and arams the mmr seems to be a lot more relaxed and quite often the difference between teams is hundreds of points. Which is fine for me because I making an effort to improve my game and I realize I need that better competition, the problem is though that my teams aren't on the level. I had a game a couple of days ago was 5 unranked and below 30 levels vs a plat 2 silvers and 1 bronze. Like seriously?\nI'm currently on 4 wins from my last 20 games yet even in losing teams I'm getting 10-0-11, 4-2-2 and 23-11-22 as adc.
