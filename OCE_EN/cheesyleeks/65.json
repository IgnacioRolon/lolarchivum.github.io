Acid Hunter missile-locks on enemies affected by Noxian Corrosive Charge.\r\n\r\nUrgot fires a missile toward the cursor that deals 20/50/80/120/150 (+70% Attack Damage) physical damage. If Acid Hunter kills a unit half its mana cost is refunded.Missile-lock can be achieved by holding the cursor over a target afflicted by Noxian Corrosive Charge.\r\n\r\nTerror Capacitor\r\n\r\nCost: 55/60/65/70/75 Mana\r\nRange: 600\r\n\r\nUrgot charges up his capacitor to gain a shield. While the shield is active, Urgot gains slowing attacks.\r\n\r\nUrgot charges up his terror capacitor to gain a shield that absorbs 60/100/140/180/220  plus 8/9/10/12/15% of his maximum mana  for 5 seconds. While the shield is active, Urgot&#039;s attacks and missiles slow targets by 15/20/25/30/40%. each consecutive hit of acid hunter or basic attack while cause the slow to increase by 5% and will max out at 4 increments.\r\n\r\nNoxian Corrosive Charge\r\n\r\nCost: 50/55/60/65/70 Mana\r\nRange: 900\r\n\r\nUrgot launches a corrosive charge that damages enemies in an area and increase&#039;s damage dealt.\r\n\r\nUrgot launches a Corrosive Charge at a target location. Enemies afflicted by the charge take 7/10/13/16/20% increased damage from urgot and take 75/130/185/240/295 (+50% bonus Attack Damage) physical damage over 5 seconds.Acid Hunter is able to missile-lock onto targets affected by Noxian Corrosive Charge and the target will be locked for 4.5/5/5.5/6/7 seconds.\r\n\r\nHyper-Kinetic Position Reverser/fearless noxian.\r\n\r\nCost: 100 Mana\r\nRange: 550/700/850\r\n\r\nUrgot charges up his Hyper-Kinetic Position Reverser, swapping positions with the target His target is suppressed for the duration of the channel. He gains Damage Reduction during and after the swap.\r\n\r\nUrgot targets an enemy champion and channels his Hyper-Kinetic Position Reverser for 1 second, swapping locations with his target afterward. His target is suppressed for the duration of the channel.Urgot takes 30/40/50% reduced damage for 5 seconds beginning at the start of the channel, and his target is slowed by 40% for 3 seconds after being swapped.\r\n\r\nFearless noxian - urgot can activate terror capacitor and over charge it while channeling,if urgot puts himself in harms way and any other champion but the supressed champion attacks him or uses an abiltity on him 2/2.5/3 seconds after swapping, he will emit a pulse from his terror capacitor and fear targets for 1/1.5/2 seconds in an 850 radius.\r\n\r\n\r\nthoughts? criticisms?{{champion:6}} {{item:3070}} {{item:3070}}{{champion:6}}","replies":[{"poster":"Lord Sesshomaru","date":"2016-08-25T08:44:32.287+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I agree that Urgot doesn't need a re-work, (although I would argue that he needs a Visual Update)\n\nthe only thing I would change about Urgot is his Ultimate, I agree with riot in the sense that it would be much better suited to a more engage-y champ like a tanky jungler, rather than an averagely squishy damage champ like Urgot.\n\nI think the problem is, no one knows where he is supposed to go, is he a marksman? is he an AD mage? is he a 1v1 fighter in the top lane? Is he a gank machine in the jungle? very few people know, and so they play him in the wrong positions and then don't do well and think \"well thats a shit champ\"\n\nbut In my experience, nothing stops a fed Urgot\n\nalso if my comp changes \"Urgot\" to \"argot\" one more time, I'm going to break something!","replies":[]},{"poster":"Sloth Almighty","date":"2016-08-25T06:52:27.347+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I don't get why no one plays Urgot tbh. He gets a lot of neglect but he actually isn't that bad. Granted I find his ultimate as useless as a mint-flavored suppository, but that's just because I don't know how to use it properly. As a whole, he can be an effective champ to play","replies":[]}]}
