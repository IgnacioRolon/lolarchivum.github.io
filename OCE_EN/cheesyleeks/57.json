However if he mucks up, misses his E and then is forced to retreat, he cant just try again and again. He is punished by now having a window of vulnerability.\n\nWith Shen, pretty much as long as you are always hitting your spells, you shouldn't have a problem, and should almost always have enough energy available for your next 1 or 2 spells.\n\nAlso it's good to note that your ultimate has no cost, so as long as it is off cooldown, you will always have access to it, and using it wont disadvantage you in the skirmish that you are ulting into.\n\nPersonally, I think energy regen runes would be a waste of time, especially seeming in all situations other than a balls-to-the-wall engage, Shen will be sitting on full, or near full energy anyway, It would be better in my opinion to take tanky runes and survive long enough for you to hit all your Q's and regain that energy. \n\nHe does regain energy quite significantly if you land all of your spells. Shen can farm with his Q constantly, and still sit on a full energy pool.\n\nI hope this helps, and good luck with the best ninja in the game ^^ \n\nBelieve it!\n\n:P","replies":[{"poster":"CHEESYLEEKS","date":"2017-03-21T04:06:05.371+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"thanks","replies":[]},{"poster":"Roguestoney","date":"2017-03-21T03:18:29.777+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Good post.","replies":[]}]}]}
