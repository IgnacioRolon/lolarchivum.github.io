Since ARAM doesn't have the roles that rift does that would be impossible, same goes for the other game modes. So really it's your performance on that champ in that role in that game mode, with norms/ranked being the \"normal\" game mode.\n\nARAM can be pretty polarising as far as scores are concerned, you have massive outliers where people don't die or where people almost only die, so there isn't going to be an obvious bar for about where an S would be in most cases.\n\nKill participation also seems to be more important that KDA, so that's something to consider as well.","replies":[{"poster":"CHEESYLEEKS","date":"2016-06-22T16:50:09.239+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"the struggle is real, feelsbadman","replies":[]}]}]}
