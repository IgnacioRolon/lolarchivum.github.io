I&#039;m not saying we have to be all friendly and shit, but at least not try to make things worse. Me for example, I like to just mute all if I feel like flame wars are about to begin. If you feel like being friendly every now and then, please go for it! But you don&#039;t have to be if you don&#039;t want to, just mute them then and play the game for what it is.\r\n\r\nEverybody has bad games, it&#039;s just OCE life, but I think the only way for us to get better as a whole, is to avoid that toxic shit.  I mean, doesn&#039;t it just feel crap when people decide to troll? Just ignore them and don&#039;t give them attention. I dunno, I just kinda feel sad for Australia LOL  (I know OCE isn&#039;t only Australia) and I want us to be better.","replies":[{"poster":"BlitzForever","date":"2015-11-09T03:43:24.967+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"But muting can also make it more toxic, since you ain't communicating or talking with your team (even if flame wars is going on)","replies":[{"poster":"St4inl3ss","date":"2015-11-09T03:48:52.030+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"Hmm nah ignoring is always better, and at least for yourself you don't have to be frustrated.

There is no chat at all. Only pings.\nYes, I know, saying the name of another MOBA is like going to a church and screaming out \"Hail Satan\", but my point stands. Why is a chat necessary anyway? If you really want to speak to your team, make friends with them and get in a skype call. I have like half my friends list (nearing 130 people) on skype, so whenever I'm in a game with them, I just ring them up and its all good.","replies":[{"poster":"Maraudaur","date":"2015-11-09T07:25:48.458+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"http://ask.fm/RiotLyte/\n\nCheck out more cool answers by Lyte on his Ask.fm (listed above) But i found this one that is super relevant to your question.\n\n> **why is there even chat in this game instead of a system of automated messages?â€Ž**\n> \n> This is actually a great question.\n> We agree, chat COULD be non-essential, and we could start building the systems and tools to completely replace chat, such as the feature you mentioned of putting in short-cuts to automate messages, or systems like the \"chat\" system in Hearthstone. However, our design philosophy is to not completely remove a feature just because there is a potential for toxicity--we always assess the pros and cons, and try to see if we can figure out a design that is net positive. For example, although there is far less verbal toxicity in a game of Hearthstone, there's also less meaningful interactions and dialogue. In some games that remove chat, it's even hard to tell whether you are playing versus an AI or a human and that makes a difference in your connection with the game. It's nearly impossible to get to know someone without being able to express yourself organically through conversation, and if that's impossible, it's really hard to make friends. We were just reviewing data today that a majority of players have made a real, online friend in League and play with them a decent number of games a month--that's awesome. We think there is huge value in chat and some of our best experiences are those matches where you're chatting it up in games and become friends after.\n> To us, that positive experience is so valuable that it was worth trying features like Chat Restrictions and All-Chat Filters to try to reduce the negativity of chat, while still keeping the benefits.","replies":[{"poster":"EzeBlood","date":"2015-11-12T04:20:04.664+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thanks Maraudaur, will check that out more often!","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"St4inl3ss","date":"2015-11-09T04:25:21.933+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Yeah I mean I'd rather communicate cause this game's about teamwork, but it can be so frustrating most of the times (not even sometimes lol) and pings are clear and easy to understand.
