Just like when everyone noob f*ckwit played teemo back in s2-3 and when every noob c*nt played kat mid, the new f*cking trend is to play this unbelievably annoying champ. Before you say anything no there not good, I don&#039;t mind if they are actually good at him but 99.9% are all f*cking bad. Its not that I cant beat them, its the annoying gameplay of this terrible champion. This game is getting worse and worse and worse and worse. Fix your fucking game riot, ffs only reason why I&#039;m playing this is because its free and I&#039;m broke.","replies":[{"poster":"Project Xayah","date":"2016-11-04T13:17:23.318+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"> There is always one \"cocky\" yasou player in *95% of my games*\n\nNo, there's really not. Over the past month or so you've had Yasuos in 22 out of 108 games, which puts the *total* number of games you've played with a Yasuo at approximately 20%. That's an over-exaggeration of *at least* 75%.\n\nI would also like to take the time to point out that the gameplay of Yasuo is not the issue in this context, despite some of your statements. The issue is that people see pros playing an \"easy\" champ and figure they can pull off the same kind of plays with 0 skill, mechanics and knowledge.\n\nJust report the players for feeding if it get's that bad.\n\n> only reason why I'm playing this is because its free and I'm broke.\n\nDude, just save yourself the trouble and leave already. LoL is a massive waste of time and just makes life more difficult. Besides, there's far superior \"true free to play\" games out there.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Talon12","date":"2016-11-04T13:48:14.306+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"\nRetards who think they are good when they are not and think that yasuo is \"op, easy and broken\" when he isnt ruin the game.\n\nyasuos are nothing but [free](http://igg-games.com/) elo.","replies":[]}]}
