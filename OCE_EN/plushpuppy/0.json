I climbed steadily to plat 1 in the past 3 months, hoping to get diamond and then leave.\r\n\r\nBy steadily, I mean I lost games, I won games, I did OK in lane, won on average more than my opponent, so I climbed at a steady rate.\r\n\r\nBut literally in the past week, I have been getting matched with the trashest botlanes anyone has ever seen. I mean I have mostly been beating my top lane as trynd consistently, after watching fogged and reading his guides, learning the matchups etc. But then I come out of lane and the consistent theme is that both my adc and sup is 0/3 AT LEAST. And the game snowballs away from there. \r\n\r\nThis has happened over a week and I have dropped from plat 1 to plat 4. I seriously implore anyone to check my most recent match history. When you do, please find me the average amount of botlanes that I have had that have ended the game with a positive score. Trust me, the average number will be so low, because they have been so fucking scarce. \r\n\r\nFuck this game, I have uninstalled as these series of losses has demotivated me heavily. Trash fucking community, there are far better things to do with my time.","replies":[{"poster":"JasonWazza","date":"2019-10-03T14:49:29.032+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"\"But literally in the past week,\"\n\nSchool holidays man, stop playing and wait.","replies":[{"poster":"DarkShade918","date":"2019-10-05T07:30:22.132+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=JasonWazza,realm=OCE,application-id=T8eq2lFQ,discussion-id=d00h2IPT,comment-id=0001,timestamp=2019-10-03T14:49:29.032+0000)\n> \n> School holidays man, stop playing and wait.\n\nValid point","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Garen Player","date":"2019-10-03T14:25:47.749+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Simple solution, stop playing tryndamere and play 1v5 champions.\nBad mentality players like you are the reason you people hate the game, I've been through the same situation buddy, sometimes I wish i can ping more than 6 times to open their brains up, but there are limits.","replies":[]}]}
