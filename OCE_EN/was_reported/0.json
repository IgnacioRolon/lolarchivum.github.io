Basically mute everyone in game, don't say anything and you'll be able to earn loot in a few days.","replies":[{"poster":"Was Reported","date":"2016-06-09T02:21:58.249+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"This has been going on for 4 weeks","replies":[{"poster":"Corehog","date":"2016-06-09T02:54:54.101+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"The reform period doesn't have a definitive time frame and is situational to each player and the behaviour that resulted in the initial ban/suspension/chat restriction.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"kinggankalot","date":"2016-06-17T08:22:32.852+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"honestly its just leauge of legands being stupid and unfair to player who get chat restricted i got trolled by a 4 stack and baned because of it now i cant earn loot leauge suport needs to fix this bug","replies":[{"poster":"Wuks","date":"2016-06-18T04:45:55.265+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Reform is an important factor in determining whether players are able to take advantage of the Hextech Crafting system.\n\nCheck out this article for more information: https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/209939463-Hextech-Crafting-Restrictions\n\nAdditionally, keep in mind that retaliation isn't an excuse for negative behaviour.
