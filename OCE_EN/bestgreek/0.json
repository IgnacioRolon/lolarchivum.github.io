I want to enchant level 6 but i cannot. Is is because you want me to spend how much money just opening up creates and hoping for blue essence or Shen shard to pop out. To me that seems unfair and unreasonable. As i would like to rank up my main champion but cannot, because it requires me to spend money and pray that i get essence or Shen champion shard?","replies":[{"poster":"SephirothSG","date":"2016-06-02T01:05:55.318+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey there,\n\nOpening and earning hextech crates can be done without spending a cent, I myself have earned a majority of my keys that way. \n\nYou can disenchant any champ shard you get for blue essence, so you don't have to hope you get a shen shard.","replies":[]}]}
