Trying to sign up on the first day gives you seating all the way at the back of the stadium? Do ones in the front open up more as time passes? Because these seats totally suck you can&#039;t even pick to pay for higher money seats on this dumb website.","replies":[{"poster":"GeneralCoxy","date":"2015-05-04T09:32:30.105+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hi Selluna, the site allocates the best seats first. Sorry if this is frustrating. We have not released sections 3&4 yet as we have some last minute production changes with the size of the stage and the last thing we want is to have to move you or worst have your view blocked with a piece of production equipment. The 1 & 2 sections are really awesome as they are tiered seats so you will have a great view of all the action!","replies":[{"poster":"Selluna","date":"2015-05-04T10:25:24.409+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'm short sighted T_T Need to be closer to the screen! Do you know when section 3 and 4 will come out? Also how come we can't even try for the middle of the section 1 or 2? Whenever I try it gives us the sides. However once when it bugged out and tried to put 10 seats in a row it put us in the middle. Isn't that slightly unfair that only large groups get good seats? Also is section 2 filled completely? I have a seriously hard time believing that because all I'm seeing available is the sides of section 1.","replies":[{"poster":"GeneralCoxy","date":"2015-05-04T11:52:22.865+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hi Selluna, sorry you are having issues with the seat map. 3 & 4 go on sale tomorrow check Facebook and Twitter for the time that they go up.

In terms of the allocation, its done on best seat so I am sorry if this did not work out.","replies":[{"poster":"Selluna","date":"2015-05-04T11:58:54.572+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thanks for replying by the way!
