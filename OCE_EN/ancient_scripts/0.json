Was there a new patch where you get assigned to a role you did not even sign up for?\r\n\r\nI had to dodge the game; luckily it was my placements so I do not lose out on anything except having to wait another 5 minutes. Could you please look into this Rito and tell me what happened?","replies":[{"poster":"Ing√©nue","date":"2016-09-24T00:52:32.646+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yup, so its [a new-ish feature called autofill](http://na.leagueoflegends.com/en/news/game-updates/competitive/ranked-updates-now-live#patch-autofill), designed to keep queue waiting times to a minimum. You will get a little icon at the bottom indication it has been turned on.\nIt happens when queue timers are bound to be long, such as off peak times. \n\nFor lower elos, I have found it to be on most of the time as you guys can be waiting in queue for ages because nobody is picking support. \n\nLuckily, you won't be autofilled in your promotion matches (as this could undermine your ability to contribute your best when it matters most) and once you have autofilled, you can't be autofilled for the couple of games. \n\nTop advice: Become an efficient support, because you will be doing it a lot.","replies":[{"poster":"Ancient Scripts","date":"2016-09-24T04:43:47.160+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I guess its mostly just in OCE. This happened in plat elo in my placements at peak times so I don't get it. But thanks for the info I guess Rito just wants us to spend more money buying champs.","replies":[]}]}]}
