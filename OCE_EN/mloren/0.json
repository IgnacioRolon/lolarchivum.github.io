Is it just another round of earning points through winning games?\n\nHere's what it should be:\n\nSpecial game mode for a few days set on Howling Abyss.\nGiant crab starts in the middle of the map and fights the minion waves from both sides as they approach.\nPlayers play as normal except they can attack the giant crab which can also draw its aggro off the minions and onto them.\nGiant crab is super strong and takes about 10 minutes of continuous attacks from both teams to kill.\nTeams can attack crab and try to whittle it down or can fight each other.\nGiant crab focuses more on the side with the most deaths, so getting kills kind of turns the crab to your advantage.\nIf crab reaches a building it will attack it.\nWinning team is the one that gets the killing blow on the giant crab, or the team that kills the nexus (with crabs help).\n\nI think that would be beautiful chaos. :)","replies":[]}
