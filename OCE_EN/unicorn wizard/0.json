Only lobby not currently experiencing it is the Custom Lobby, which I believe is Local? My assumption would be server side, after having several people repair clients and still experiencing it - And that every person apart of the lobby sees different results of the bug (some don't see players/role selections/queueing/game invites etcetc).\r\n\r\nSucky timing for it to happen on Vic Public Holiday.\r\n {{sticker:zombie-nunu-tears}} \r\n\r\n\r\nThanks for your hard work.\r\n{{sticker:katarina-love}}","replies":[{"poster":"Gragozz","date":"2019-09-27T05:06:29.727+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Well my friends and i managed to find a work around, Make a lobby doesnt matter if its aram ranked etc, have everyone join then change the game mode to whatever you want to play then have everyone leave and rejoin, then all other players must pick their roles before the host picks theirs otherwise it wont work, once every has picked roles the host can then pick and start q, this process must be repeated each time a game is finished :(","replies":[]},{"poster":"Ryeotix","date":"2019-09-27T09:18:08.812+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":":( need an update!","replies":[]},{"poster":"alzee y","date":"2019-09-27T08:07:23.372+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"im experiencing it too, feels bad and cant queue with my friend to earn tokens{{sticker:slayer-jinx-unamused}}","replies":[]}]}
