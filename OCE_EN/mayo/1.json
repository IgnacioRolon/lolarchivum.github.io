Players could apply for player moderators or are picked to be player moderators based on their player record. \r\nThey'd be contacted by Riot via email or in game and asked if they would like to be a player moderator. They play the game as usual, but they have a moderator badge, or even just a hidden thing (Kind of like the honor initiative). Their reports count for extra and maybe puts a red flag next to the abusive players name for Riot to see? They are warned with a warning possibly like the leave buster warning, and if they continue the behavior they are potentially punished? Maybe the player would be muted for the next game or some sort of tiny punishment.\r\nThey wouldn't be Riot employees, just players who volunteer to keep the community clean.  This is for abusive players, and not so much AFK. In OCE as we know there is a lot of toxic players and I believe this idea would be good.\r\n\r\nThis idea does sound prone to power abuse, but you could have a harsh penalty as in the player getting perma banned for abusing their power? \r\n\r\nIt would be great if you guys could show this some support! \r\nFeel free to add any comments to the idea!! I'm open to suggestions and together as a community we could have this idea perfected implemented!","replies":[{"poster":"Lonely Flame","date":"2015-01-05T12:13:51.150+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Can't tell if sarcasm or you're new...so I'm going to assume you're new.\n\nThis idea already existed.

What would stop anyone from just reporting the entire enemy team? Or even their own team?  How would players appeal this if they were unfairly insta-banned?

The game is finished! It just becomes the Tribunal System.\n\nYou want to have a feature that allows people to report players mid-game so that they become insta-banned at the end of the game. And so if someone is incorrectly banned, they have to launch an appeal (while still being banned mind you) which means that other people will have to look to decide if the ban was fair or not. Which just creates the Tribunal System. Do you get it now? You've just made an extra, more unnecessary step.","replies":[{"poster":"HORSE OF FORCE","date":"2015-01-09T01:11:07.460+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"No no no, you've got it all wrong.

This is to remove toxic players from the game. They would get a temporary one game mute or something like that. \nObviously players could send in proof to riot support if the moderator was abusing power, have their moderator status removed and possibly banned.","replies":[{"poster":"Lonely Flame","date":"2015-01-09T06:31:06.461+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"How do you send in that proof though? Do you not see that this creates a whole EXTRA on top of the new one of Riot having to actually go through all appeals?\nThe whole thing about the tribunal system was so Riot didn't have to ban people themselves. They got the community to read chat logs, game stats etc and decide by a majority decision whether a player should be banned or not, all of whom are indifferent to the game. If a player appealed it, it would go to the Tribunal System again.\nWhat you're suggesting is a minority system where in potentially LESS THAN 9 PEOPLE, (all of them are personally linked to that game because, you know, they're in it) can potentially cause someone to have a mute on their upcoming games, and then that player has to launch an appeal to Riot themselves.\nIt's a lot easier to just reinstate the old Tribunal System. If you want instant bannings, why not just use the old system and have a feature along the lines of 'Live Bannings'?","replies":[{"poster":"Mayo","date":"2015-01-15T16:04:16.366+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You wouldn't make any old person a moderator, it would be a rigorous method of finding the best players for the job?","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"HORSE OF FORCE","date":"2015-01-07T08:47:47.767+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I thought this was already integrated.
