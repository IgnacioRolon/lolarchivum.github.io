I had even changed my password several times in a short period of time because i had suspicions my account was being hijacked, but again riot support refuses to listen to me. \nI had actually been away for roughly a one month period when i came back to my permanent ban (uni exam time).\n\nFeel free to add me in client - &quot;mayo jnr&quot;     if you would like to discuss anything in regards to my ban (particularly rioters). Or if you can get me in contact with someone who can help me i would appreciate it so much! Maybe i will gift u xx\n{{sticker:cass-cry}} \nFeel free to leave your opinion below\nThank you my friends, I hope we can free mayo.\n","replies":[{"poster":"Gehirn","date":"2018-02-01T06:23:29.175+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":1,"body":"Hi Mayo,\n\nI'm afraid we can't unban this account.\n\nWhile it may be that you were not the one playing on the account at the time the permanent ban took place, I believe responsibility does sit with you as the account owner in this instance.\n\nYour last password reset was 6 months prior to the ban. During this period of time, your account was accessed many times by someone you knew. Given the time frames of the login records, I have no doubt you would have seen the \"Your account has been logged into from another computer\" message in client at least once in those 6 months. This should have been a clear trigger for you to perform another password reset to secure your account.\n\nYour account being in such severe negative standing prior to the permanent ban was due to your own actions in game, as you mentioned.\n\nI'm sorry to say it, but because your account's permanent ban was ultimately your responsibility, the ban should not be removed.","replies":[{"poster":"JasonWazza","date":"2018-02-01T06:44:11.346+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> I have no doubt you would have seen the \"Your account has been logged into from another computer\" message in client at least once in those 6 months.\n\nWait.... if that is a thing to pop up, why hadn't i seen this when i got a new computer?","replies":[{"poster":"ThatsBS","date":"2018-02-05T09:25:02.963+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=JasonWazza,realm=OCE,application-id=T8eq2lFQ,discussion-id=AMqAiGRd,comment-id=00010000,timestamp=2018-02-01T06:44:11.346+0000)\n>\n> Wait.... if that is a thing to pop up, why hadn&#x27;t i seen this when i got a new computer?\n\nWere you at the same place though?","replies":[{"poster":"JasonWazza","date":"2018-02-05T09:28:25.755+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"If i recall correctly no, but Seras already said that it's to do with being forced logged out because someone else logged in (how that justifies this topic is beyond me but whatever not much we can do)","replies":[{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2018-02-05T09:55:25.993+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yeah it's just for being force logged out.

That said, how much money you&#x27;ve spent doesn&#x27;t change anything. All players are treated the same, regardless of if they spend money or not.\n\nYou made some very valid points there. \nI'll try to address your points in the most progressive and logical way i possibly can.\n\n**Viruses:**\nyes, i had a virussy computer but it wasn't at the point where it wasn't unreliable or horrible, it ran fine but i was aware it had some viruses. i wasn't really in a state to spend the money on antivirus anyway. Like you said, regardless of money everyone should be treated fairly, so because i wasnt able to buy antivirus and my account was compromised because of it i don't deserve my account back? \n\n**Security:**\nYes you are also correct that security is up to me. and i tried to maintain it as best as i could. Like ive explained, as soon as i was aware of a lack of integrity on my account i changed my password.\nFirstly, this person who i suspect it is - and im still not sure it was them has no access to my computer physically because if it is who i think it is they're from Sydney or Melbourne and i live in adelaide, so its only via virus, which i just explained the situation about. (now that i think about it, i believe it may have been a link from skype?). At the time i wasn't aware he was the one hacking me, i am only assuming and using hindsight. i'm sure if someone who is ur friend sends u a link on skype you'd click it. \nI am not expecting riot to protect me from viruses, i just am asking riot to please give my account back that i care about highly. You are assuming that i am GIVING my password constantly which i feel is a very unfair thing to do after me having explained my situation.\n\nYou are correct, it does not matter how much money i spend on this game, i am expected to behave the same as everyone else and i am in full agreement with you on that one. \nI'm only saying that its hard for me to let go on these terms because it was not me who caused my final chance on my account to be taken away. i just want to prove my innocence and get back to playing on my main account for multiple reasons - not just money. \n\nThis whole time i am fully accepting of all of my previous punishments and anything else you guys say.\ni am a person who believes in consequences when i make a mistake. i am honest and i own up to my mistakes. but this i can't justify it being completely my fault. If i was the toxic player who flamed people out and was on the account when it got permanently banned i can live with the punishment.\ni was in a period in my life where i was taking a huge step leaving home (a small country town) to move to the city to follow my passion and study health and medical science at university. i was extremely busy trying to learn things like transport (I've never even seen public transport before) or food (i had to learn how to cook because i lived by myself) or even where the university is. it was a huge move for me coming from a small country town with a very tiny population.  not to mention the course that i was studying as well as part time job with my parents to fund all of this. \n\nI just had a lot going on and i was not able to check league of legends enough to find something fishy. Everyone makes mistakes and i guess mine was not checking up on my account enough (if im being critical of myself). Generally you just assume your account is safe - i mean who regularly checks up on their account to see if its safe. but i'm sure you guys can understand this mistake due to everything that was going on.\nI admit people have worse things going on in their life and this isn't really a big deal compared to what other people go through but im sure this is a suffice reason for my inactivity on my account and hence lack of security. \n\nI know this is just my word but please trust me. I guess i can show documentation of when i started university and where i started living and where i moved from and at what dates - and i will if i have to. **_i feel this is extreme but it is the lengths im willing to go to. _**\n_**If I was a liar I wouldn't be able to provide this documentation which I am willing to provide. if I was a liar I would not be this committed to try get my account back**_. I had many contact hours at university and I had work which just ultimately meant I was too busy and thats the truth. \n\nAgain - if there is anything i provide you guys to help this case please ask. \nThank you again.","replies":[{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2018-02-01T15:22:44.079+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":2,"body":"Malwarebytes will do almost everything you need as far as viruses are concerned, and it's free.

I knew barely anything about computers - as seen from above I still don't really. being in a remote country town, u can't just pop down to ur local computer shop because we don't have one, and with that we have a severe lack of knowledge. \nI did not have access to the resources you may have where you live. \nI'm sure you will find a response saying that I should just look online but again I didn't know much. I didn't know until recently that key loggers are a thing and people can remotely access ur information. as a matter of fact I don't even know now how a key logger works all I know is that they can get ur details. \n\nI am talking about a compromised account Seras Dragon - I am sorry that it did happen my friend but the account was compromised. I now know how to prevent this in the future but if I had the knowledge I have now and reading everything you've said I would have avoided this situation. but unfortunately I am in the situation and I am really hoping a riot employee who can understand my situation will be able to help me.  \n\n\nLooking forward to your response, good to see what people think.","replies":[{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2018-02-02T01:22:34.338+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":2,"body":"Malwarebytes is just a free antivirus.

(i believe the client disappearing is a normal thing to occur before this new updated client or maybe even for this one im not sure). and the client never opened up again. \nso essentially i never actually got to see the message because my client was disappeared and i just assumed it was a bugsplat. \n\nThank you again Gehirn and Seras Dragon\nI really hope this is the missing piece of the puzzle.","replies":[]}]}
