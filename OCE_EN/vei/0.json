He ran out of supplies at his home, and lacked any other way to get it, other than to go very dangerously near Bandle City. He knew he was never allowed into the city itself, but he knew nearby towns that could still help him with the resources he needed. The only issue was his reputation preceded him... the countless stares of yordles around, watching him as he walked by, generally avoiding him in his path and shunning him... The look that the shopkeeper gave him as he harshly requested the food and parchment that he needed, roughly planted his palm down on the counter, dropping a large bag of gold. The yordle shopkeeper couldn&#039;t say no to the offer... but that didn&#039;t stop the fearful stare.\r\n\r\n    Yes. Fear... that&#039;s what he wanted them to feel. He could feel the fear in their hearts...\r\n\r\n    ...\r\n\r\n    It seemed fear was the only way he could get people to notice him... There had been some who never took him seriously, who laughed at his boasting of evil prowess, who made fun of him behind his back. The people that used to be his neighbors, Bandle City which used to be his home, now shunning him and causing him to isolate himself from society. This was the life he now lived.\r\n\r\n    ... Was it what he really wanted...?\r\n\r\n    Veigar shook his head, silencing that voice inside his mind. Told it to shut up. What&#039;s done is done. He is but a bitter shell of his former self, trapping himself isolated in the forest, doing evil work in his evil castle... This was his destiny.\r\n\r\n    He knew it wouldn&#039;t be the best idea to go out of his way to gather supplies. He walked a long way for this, the winding forest paths taking him deeper back into the forest, as he once again observed the overcast sky. He was aware of the impending storm. Normally, he would have just teleported back...\r\nbut he knew he was becoming lazy. Even his frail and tortured, scarred body needed SOME exercise, every once in awhile. He readjusted the bag of supplies he bought over his back, and continued trudging forward.\r\n\r\n    He found himself traveling past a familiar forest clearing, a wide open oasis amongst the endless dark trees. It was like a mini dome, with the forest canopy still covering most of the sky above, but with little to no trees residing in the center. In the center itself was a single log, appearing like a bench that you&#039;d find at any park where young yordles go to play. When he passed by this forest clearing on his way to gather supplies, it was empty. However, on his way back, there was but a single occupant sitting alone on the solitary log.\r\n\r\n    He paused before entering the clearing fully, analyzing its lone occupant. A young looking yordle. A rather different looking specimen, actually. He had only heard of descriptions of this kind in prehistoric history. He knew because of his vast library he owned back at his castle, knowing more about yordle history than ANYONE in Bandle City. Orange fur. Ceremonial skull on its forehead. A single boomerang made out of bone resting beside it. Orange fur all around except for the tips of its wide ears and the tip of its rather elongated tail, which were both painted an ancient hue of cyan blue. Rather, it&#039;s whole body was orange because it didn&#039;t even wear much clothing, except for a single tribal loincloth protecting its sensitive parts. He remembered this yordle.\r\n\r\n    This yordle went by the name of Gnar. Or at least, thats just what Gnar kept saying most of the time, thus everyone dubbed it as Gnar. A yordle supposedly frozen in time. Veigar had heard the stories. Had researched him. Whatever ancient time it was from, Gnar was definitely a different sort of anatomy, as Veigar&#039;s generation had most surely evolved from Gnar&#039;s time. Veigar didn&#039;t know of ANY yordles who even had a tail, for god&#039;s sake.\r\n\r\n    He had never encountered Gnar before today, however. Veigar wasn&#039;t one who made much friends. He barely talked much to ANYONE (besides a certain sorceress who would never stop pestering him and turning him into a squirrel if he so much as lifted his staff). He didn&#039;t perceive Gnar as much of a threat, actually, as Gnar was biologically only 4 yordle years old. Barely above a toddler. Yet, Gnar seemed to show much more intelligence than the average 4 year old yordle. If only people could actually understand Gnar&#039;s words. Most of his &quot;words&quot; came out in some ancient language which he had barely scraped the surface of researching. Although, Veigar was sure he was rather close to uncovering and creating a form of magic that could translate it for him...\r\n\r\n    Right now however, he would rather not chance an encounter with Gnar. He needed to get back home soon, before the storm clouds became vicious and allowed a torrental downpour to shake the forest world. Unfortunately, he needed to cross this clearing anyways, so the most he could hope for is\r\nsimply traveling by without interruption.\r\n\r\n    Knowing Gnar&#039;s personality, he knew the chances of that were next to nada.\r\n\r\n    Gnar perked his ears curiously as he heard a newcomer enter the forest clearing. He turned his head in the direction of the new arrival, observing a yordle wearing a robe outfit, rather unique to the prehistoric yordle. Gnar had never encountered this dark yordle before, as he gazed at Veigar with wide eyes.\r\n\r\n    &quot;Gnarrr... ?!&quot; The prehistoric yordle slides off of the lone treelog, facing Veigar curiously. Veigar himself notices the young yordle&#039;s awareness of his presence, staring Gnar down from the corner of his eyes, but proceeds forward without hesitation, intent on simply walking on by and crossing the\r\nforest clearing.\r\n\r\n    Gnar continues staring at the dark yordle, curiousity getting the better of him. He swiftly dashes forward, almost on all four&#039;s stopping just to the side of Veigar&#039;s impending path, jumping up and down, side to side, with almost uncontainable excitement. &quot;Okanoo... oga manni maxa!&quot; Gnar almost humorously raises his arms, roughly imitating a greeting.\r\n\r\n    Veigar still holds his yellow stare out of the corner of his eye, as he continues forward, barely acknowledging Gnar&#039;s presence as he just walks right on past the prehistoric yordle.\r\n\r\n    Gnar holds his arms raised in the air, realizing that he is being ignored. However, his innocent mind doesn&#039;t even perceive it as being rude at all, as he once again dashes forward, this time dashing around Veigar and stopping directly blocking the dark yordle&#039;s path, once again raising his arms high up in the air.\r\n\r\n    &quot;.... Grrrr..... GnnRAWRRRRR!!!&quot; The young yordle makes a comic face and a pose, facing down the dark yordle bravely.\r\n\r\n    Veigar stops in his path a couple of feet from Gnar. His yellow eyes, unbeknownst to Gnar, hold a rather bemused gaze now. Veigar was hoping something like this wouldn&#039;t happen. However, the voice buried deep inside his mind seemed to be reaching out. Reminding him that Gnar is young and harmless. Very innocent. Veigar did not need to take any hostile action to fix this &quot;situation&quot;. As a matter of fact, perhaps Veigar could put some of that old research to use now. He grinned to himself.\r\n\r\n    &quot;So... you are Gnar, eh?&quot; Veigar smugly asked the young yordle. Gnar&#039;s ears perked up excitedly, bobbing his head up and down at the mention of his name. &quot;What are you doing way out here all by yourself? The forest isn&#039;t exactly the safest place for a lone yordle like yourself...&quot;\r\n\r\n    Gnar seemed to calm down a little at the dark yordle&#039;s words. Even if Gnar&#039;s own words couldn&#039;t be understood by many individuals, he seemed to become accustomed to the common language of the land himself, even if he couldn&#039;t speak he language. Gnar didn&#039;t know how to respond.\r\n\r\n    &quot;Ah... ahangaa....!&quot; Gnar made another motion with his yordle paws. Veigar chuckled amusedly at Gnar&#039;s efforts.\r\n\r\n    &quot;You seem to be having some trouble with communication, I see...&quot; The dark yordle pondered to himself for a bit, thinking about how he could take advantage of his opportunity.\r\n\r\n    Veigar noticed the raindrop landing on Gnar&#039;s forehead, causing the young yordle to startle and become fully allert. Veigar curiously looked up and discovered that which he had been dreading. The storm clouds above had fully gathered, looking dark grey to a point that hadn&#039;t been reached for a long time. More rain drops began to fall, breaching the forest canapoy and moistening the grassy dirt around the two yordles. Veigar realized he didn&#039;t have much time to get back to his home, but before he could do anything else, he felt something crash into his side, wrapping its appendages around his waist.\r\n\r\n    He looked down in surprise to see Gnar hugging his side, shivering in a rather frightened manner. Perhaps the young yordle hadn&#039;t actually experienced rain for awhile, since it doesn&#039;t rain often at all near Bandle City. But when it does, it is a harsh downpour that will leave one soaking wet in their fur coat. Veigar resisted the urge to shake off Gnar, the inner voice inside calming him and softening his gaze at this innocent yordle clinging to his side. Still holding the bag of supplies over his back,  Veigar reached down with his free hand and laid it upon Gnar&#039;s forehead, firmly planting it there and stroking it soft.\r\n\r\n    Gnar stiffened suddenly at the feel of the lightly gauntleted hand resting ontop of his head. Then the hand gently rubbed and stroked back and forth, eliciting a wide grin out of the young yordle as he squeezed a little tigher, causing Veigar to wince from the surprising strength of the little one&#039;s arms. But Veigar didn&#039;t stop petting Gnar&#039;s head.\r\n\r\n    The rain started to fall around them. Water leaked through the forest canopy and fell in a heavy downpour around them, almost creating miniature waterfalls in an eerie setting of the forest clearing. But Veigar&#039;s wide brimmed hat was stopping the two yordles from getting wet. Gnar held on tight for some time before Veigar gently eased off  his hand from Gnar&#039;s forehead. He then raised his hand to his face and bit onto the gauntlet with his teeth, dragging it off and stripping it off of his hand, revealing a rather ominously scarred, but dark-furred yordle paw. Gnar gazed up and noticed this tattered hand as he reached down and gently took hold of one of Gnar&#039;s own paws. It wrapped his delicate fingers around Gnar&#039;s and clenched comfortably, as Gnar&#039;s own smile grinned even wider and squeezed back.\r\n\r\n    Veigar then began to start walking forward once again, but held still onto Gnar, gently tugging the young yordle until he walked and fell into pace with him, eventually exiting the clearing.\r\n\r\n    The rain fell harsher and louder, thunder heard soft yet hard at the same time in the distance, as the two yordles walked hand in hand, Veigar&#039;s hat an umbrella shielding the two from getting too wet. As the storm clouds gathered, Veigar did something he never did before in his new dark, and tainted life.\r\n\r\n    He smiled.","replies":[{"poster":"LUPIN lll","date":"2016-02-21T06:43:56.369+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Cringe autismics","replies":[{"poster":"Vei","date":"2016-02-22T18:52:17.333+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Ty for feedback","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Talon12","date":"2016-02-19T10:47:21.262+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"tldr; morale... where is his bag in the picture","replies":[{"poster":"Vei","date":"2016-02-19T16:29:07.029+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The picture isn't too relevant to the story, I just found it cute and there isn't many Gnar Veigar pics","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"lordofrage","date":"2016-02-19T06:48:24.954+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":".....um ew","replies":[{"poster":"Vei","date":"2016-02-19T07:20:38.160+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"ty for feedback","replies":[]}]}]}
