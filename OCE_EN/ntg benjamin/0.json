My game crashed twice and when I could open it, the game was at 20 min already. Then I got placed in low priority queue for AFK. Seriously! U can&#039;t even tell what is the different between being AFK and disconnecting. I&#039;m fine with the penalty if I was in a normal or ranked game because I do understand how people feel when there is a player being AFK in their team. However, the fact is I was in a co op game. Playing against bots is different from playing against people. Make my day better please.","replies":[{"poster":"Deep Terror Nami","date":"2016-01-16T07:16:49.641+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey NTG Benjamin,\n\nThe Leaver Buster system doesn't really have the luxury of making these distinctions, not necessarily because it can't, but because when you make exceptions people will exploit them to such an effect that League would be unplayable every time a person decided he didn't feel like playing.\n\nhttps://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752714-LeaverBuster-FAQ\n\nThe system is lenient in its punishment though. It starts with a warning, then gives 5 minute low priority queues that increase by 5 minutes for chronic leaving. If you don't leave often then the punishment will be light, and your leaver status will diminish after playing enough times without leaving.\n\nIf you have issues with crashing, please try to fix them, and seek assistance on the **Help & Support** board or through a [Support Ticket](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/requests/new) if you need to. Even if it's not your fault you'll have to pay the penalty as incentive to get the problem fixed; as bad as it is for you, there are other players dealing with your absence too.\n\nIf you have crashes often, please perform the steps listed on the [Bug Splats & Game Crashes article]( https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201761974-Bug-Splat-and-Game-Crashes). Let me know if you need any help.\n\n-DTN","replies":[]}]}
