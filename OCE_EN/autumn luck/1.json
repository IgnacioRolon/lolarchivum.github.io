Even though it said I have stacks (I believe I had 5 from memory at the time I realized it was not working) it gave me no additional ability power whatsoever? Any Explanation for this? Also I did not loose the correct number of stacks upon death sometimes O_o Is it just bad luck that it didn&#039;t work for me or are other people having the same problem?","replies":[]}
