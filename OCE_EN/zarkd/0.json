This type of behavior is not tolerated, but you won't always be notified when a player you report is punished; you only get a notification when your report triggered the punishment, but you still won't be told who or how.\n\nTry to refrain from posting their names on the boards, though. It is considered \"Name & Shame\" and is against forum policy. If you feel the need to report a player outside the post-game reporting feature, submit it in a [Support Ticket](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/requests/new) and a Player Behavior Specialist will look into it.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Coolbluey","date":"2016-03-11T00:54:47.462+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"I'm sorry to hear what happened Zarkd, people can be so mean sometimes. But the best thing to do is to mute them if they are really hurting you. Don't tell them if you do, just do it. If they continually ping you if you don't respond, remember that you can mute pings as well. Once again, very sorry to hear what happened, I don't know what riot will do about it but you can always do something.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Essembie","date":"2016-03-11T01:02:40.422+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"People on the net can be dicks.","replies":[]}]}
