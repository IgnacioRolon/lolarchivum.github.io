Recently I was playing Urf and was in champ select switching through all the skins for a chosen champ. I decided to skin boost and was scrolling through what I could have gotten and acidentally double clicked a champ skin and bought a certain skin! No confirm purchase option or anything. \r\n\r\nI brought this up with Riot support and unfortuantely cant refund me this purchase as all my tokens have already been used. I just feel like a confirm feature should be implemented to save others from the same issue.\r\n\r\nRegards,\r\nSquidy","replies":[{"poster":"Łæoña","date":"2017-08-16T00:15:31.252+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Well, it should've said in a textbox that you can now buy skins in champ select so you should've been aware but I also get what you mean and yes it should- to prevent people from first time purchasing instantly.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Lord Sesshomaru","date":"2017-08-16T00:18:25.600+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I have also noticed that there is no longer a confirmation box in the store either.\nIn the old client it used to ask you after clicking purchase, now it doesn't. \n\nJust an observation.","replies":[]}]}
