What you CAN see is the tier system.\n> Each tier/division has a corresponding \"ideal MMR\" value. By comparing your Current MMR with the Ideal MMR of your division, the system calculates a discrepancy, and moves you up or down the ladder according to that discrepancy, using the LP values.\n> If your Current MMR (after the game) is higher than the Ideal MMR of your division, you'll have a large gain or a small loss, and move up.\n> If your Current MMR (after the game) is lower than the Ideal MMR of your division, you'll have a small gain or a large loss, and move down.\n> Once you reach a sufficient total of LP, you go into a Promotion series. You know the rest.\n> \n> This means that while you have an accurate and very mobile rating, you also have a relatively slow, smooth variation in divisions. This was made for two reasons: first, it gives a more immediate idea of rating and growth, as it gives you a sense of progression, or \"climb\". Second, it prevents abrupt changes, such as dropping 300 points in MMR due to a losing streak (your MMR will still drop, but it'll take longer to lose divisions and you might be able to reduce the drop with a few victories after).\n> Some note that the pure, plain MMR gives a more immediate information and is more reliable, BUT it's apparently harder to understand. I am personally one of those...\n> \n> ps.\n> Placements:\n> You start with a MMR of 1200, which is roughly equivalent to Silver IV.\n> After placement matches, where MMR gain/loss is increased for higher variance, you are placed in the tier and division closest to your current rating.\n\n\nYou're welcome.","replies":[{"poster":"callyt","date":"2015-05-27T01:45:27.091+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thank you for the explanation but I've read that before and I was merely having a go at the system.","replies":[{"poster":"Ediwir","date":"2015-05-27T01:47:04.513+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Well...

Hence the system cannot give you the same points that a player with silver 5 mmr would have. The old system would have had you at bronze 2/3 elo (1050-980) as it did not mask your true elo. The system sees you being in silver 5 as a mistake but due to riot making it so you have to drop to bronze 5 mmr to be kicked from silver, you will continue to see bad lp gains.
