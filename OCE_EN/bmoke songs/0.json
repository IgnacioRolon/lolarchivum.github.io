Most haven't been accepted, the only ones who stick were direct penalties (automatic/instant ban, queue time increases) who benefitted no one.\nAmong the refused options, most were denied because of possible abuse, due to one simple thing: they gave bonuses, creating the question \"should i leave?\". The answer, for Riot, should just be \"no fucking way\".\nThe typical example is \"if X people AFK for X minutes, the game should be invalid / others should be free to leave / leavers should take the whole LP loss instead of the team\". Some similar \"solution\" got adopted by other MOBAs, and usually saw the rise of new form of tocix/abusive behaviour.\nI don't know if you ever played bad in HoN.\n\nTruth is, at the moment, rating is set in favor of non-leavers and against leavers. Applying your suggestion would reverse the effect.\nAssume you do not leave games. Assume you have a leaver every, say, five games, to make it big.\nOver a hundred games, you'll meet twenty leavers. Of these, 9 will be on your team, and 11 on the opposing team (unless you're the leaver). Assuming all games with a leaver are a loss, this nets you a total of two free wins, pushing your rating up. All the leavers, instead, got a lot of losses, which just means they lose more frequently than you (on a rate that depends on their leaver frequency).\nSure, it's a lot of assumptions, but it fits most cases, and exceptions get smoothed out over time.\nAnd it only benefits non-leavers.","replies":[{"poster":"GigaPube","date":"2015-05-30T15:40:51.531+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"no 9/11 here. its more like 15-5 tbh","replies":[{"poster":"Ediwir","date":"2015-05-31T01:09:10.653+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"That'd mean you're playing 8 vs 2 matches.
