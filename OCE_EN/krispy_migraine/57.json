Which means there is no reason why you can't stop yourself from going back. Sheer force of will.\n\nHowever an easier option would be to change your password to: **agfu6tf739gfuG73rtfp93iG4TFw6ft80w** _(something you'll never remember)_, and then you'll be unable to log into your account. You may also want to switch your account's email to a new email address and 'lose' the password for that too, to make it harder to recover your account.","replies":[{"poster":"Krispy Migraine","date":"2018-04-20T04:16:09.704+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"oof but the thing is I don't want to lose the account as I've already spent monies on it so I might want to do something with it in the future. Could you ban me for a day though? I want to see what happens when I do a day without league","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Kizeod","date":"2018-04-20T12:36:23.460+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=si_otNmE2zw\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VjzgbZL12VI\n\n^^^ Two useful videos that helped me to quit.\n\nI managed to quit league for around a year and a half and just came back recently cause I'm broke af and cant afford games right now, and League is the only fun f2p game I know of (no your wrong fortnite isn't a good game). I don't care much for playing competitively anymore and purely focus on just having fun with old friends.\n\nSo you can either force yourself to realize that this game and winning it doesn't matter, and then you will start having fun with it again, or you can quit the game entirely. The only real way to do that is to uninstall the game and move on with life. Get a job if your old enough. Go outside. Ask a girl/guy out. Find a new game you can play. There are infinite things you can to do fill the void that league will leave once you quit, you are just refusing to admit it. Its easy to fall into the trap of thinking that you rely upon league, but this is completely false.\n\nHope this helps man. Best of luck.","replies":[{"poster":"Krispy Migraine","date":"2018-04-22T21:09:00.951+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"i've watched both of the videos before which is what motivated me to stop playing league as i can relate heavily to what they state","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"DarkShade918","date":"2018-04-20T08:55:42.765+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Request that riot permaban your accounts, and then permaban you from making further accounts\n\nOr play other games, get a gf who doesn't like league, maybe get a high intensity job, so you'll be too tired to play","replies":[]},{"poster":"Project Xayah","date":"2018-04-20T00:27:56.991+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You might also want to consider account deactivation, or even account deletion (you can find the FAQ for those here: https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/202647784-Account-Deletion-FAQ).
