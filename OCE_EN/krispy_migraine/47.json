They only got bugsplatted for around 5-ish minutes in total, but those 5 minutes could have helped us win the game. \r\ndoes rito even do anything about this?","replies":[{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2018-10-17T04:31:06.638+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The Ezreal would most likely have received a loss for that game whether you won or not. Beyond that, there are no penalties beyond LB. It's very possible that was his first afk, everyone has at least one.","replies":[{"poster":"Transcender","date":"2018-10-18T01:34:54.032+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"You realise it wasn't an afk scenario, it was an error with the game and his pc?\n\nYou make it sound like he was the one at fault and was intentionally leaving the game and that he was most likely punished for it so it is ok.\n\nI realise you don't really have a say in this but the game really needs fixing, and not so much in the way of every possible different combination of device setup compatibility. The system itself needs changing to be that of how each individual performs, which would need to include how they perform with their team. This would eliminate about 99% of the complaints of feeders, and AFKers.\n\nImagine when you play a game not having to care that your team has just been feeding the whole enemy team, you just be aware of the situation and play around it as best as you can and then still climb because you deserved to climb from that game while those players who deserved to drop would drop.","replies":[]}]}]}
