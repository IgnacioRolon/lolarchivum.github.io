Well then I'd suggest rengar, evelynn, nocturne and full ap malphite (malphite is not supposed to be an assassin but if you build ap, you end up being the most faceroll assassin champion and you're still pretty useful, it's not as hard as it sounds, basically try to focus on farming till 6, maxing r>e>q>w and then devestate people with ult, runic echos spam every button, it's not much outplay but it's really easy and ridiculously effective in lower elo).","replies":[{"poster":"Nightjar","date":"2016-09-25T02:35:09.689+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Shaco is also really fun but he's hard to use since alot of his power comes from mindgames and flexibility despite having a super simple kit.

The last two are extremely strong duelists, better for winning lane hard and snowballing/spinning to victory.\n\n**Mid**:  {{champion:1}}  and {{champion:105}}  (that's supposed to be Fizz). These champions are easy but powerful, Annie has better teamfight and is an immobile mage with lots of cc whereas fizz has extreme mobility, assassination potential even when behind and a mini-zhonias making him very hard to beat in lane.\n\n**Jungle**: {{champion:19}}, {{champion:32}}  and {{champion:54}}. These champions all offer good lockdown and easy reliable ganks, especially post 6. Warwick is the first one, being one of the simplest champions in the game, he is also one of the few junglers capable of doing a full clear without runes or a leash though it helps significantly. Warwick is bad at ganking without his ult, but when you do have it up, it's generally guaranteed to make a successful gank. Ammumu offers alot of cc to the team but does rely on landing his q, he's extremely useful to the team and he has decent early ganks with it. Malphite is probably the best option and should be built tanky. Your ult does massive base damage and is a great gapclose and cc and you're jungle sustain is decent if you manage his rock shield passive. A good malphite ult can easily turn almost any teamfight.\n\n**ADC**: {{champion:22}} and {{champion:21}}. Before I start this, if you want to go adc, make sure you can cs okay (averaging at least 60-70 at 10min) . Ashe is great lategame but has a strong laning phase and lots of cc, she's immobile so you'll need to be careful when positioning but her dueling power as an adc is pretty high and her slow makes kiting a little easier (use her w to slow and kite, using her passive slow is much harder since it's not as strong). Miss Fortune is a strong lane bully and shouldn't lose early trades, she's mechanically pretty simple and lategame most of what you have to do in a teamfight is position well and ult and a good support should be able to peel for that even in low elo. She doesn't need to focus on kiting like alot of other adcs since most her damage comes from abilities like a caster but she get's alot of move speed and atk speed from her strut so it's also pretty easy to do. Mf is very strong atm and works well with supports like blitzcrank, thresh, zyra and karma.\n\n**Support**: {{champion:53}} {{champion:16}} and {{champion:37}}.  Blitzcrank is an easy champion to master with only 1 skillshot and the rest of his combo being pretty straight forward but if you can land your pulls, bot lane will be pretty easy, he does have mana issues so make sure to make your pulls count and not just fire them out randomly though. Soraka is also pretty simple, just watch out for positioning. Soraka is a strong lane bully early game with her q and e allowing her to bully and out-trade most bot laners before they get their damage spikes. Sona also does alot of damage and should stand back somewhat as well harassing with her q-aa combo and sustaining her adc through shields and healing. Later on her speed buff is extremely useful, her aura's are great in fights and her poke is extremely strong with lichbane and ludens echo procs, her ult is also a gamechanging ability doing decent damage and offering an extremely long aoe stun effect.","replies":[{"poster":"Krispy Migraine","date":"2016-09-24T01:56:51.186+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Isn't warwick getting a rework?\nAnd what happens if he gets nerfed?","replies":[{"poster":"Nightjar","date":"2016-09-24T04:46:44.847+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I had 3 suggestions for jungle.

Either to initiate the fight, or try control the fight when it has been initiated. Flash ult can work if you miss your Q, but burning your flash is always risky business.\n\nAlso fiddlesticks, if played right, can be an amazing jungler. He has 100% sustain in jg with his drain, and powerful abilities for initiation, poke or peel. Landing his ult at the correct position and time is very crucial for maximum damage, along with focusing your other abilities while ulting. Zhonyas is a pretty key item to carry as your ult continues while you're invulnerable. Squishy champ though, so positioning is always crucial","replies":[]},{"poster":"Wean","date":"2016-09-23T07:53:56.295+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"For top laner I suggest: \nDarius, he is quite OP, and he is very easy to use.\nIrelia, she is quite easy to use.\n\nFor mid laner I suggest:\nLux, Ziggs\n\nFor Marksman I suggest:\nCaitlyn\n\nFor Support I suggest\nLeona","replies":[]}]}
