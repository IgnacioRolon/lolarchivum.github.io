Unfortunately, like I said, there's no real strat to get them faster, other than making sure you're completing the conditions as often as possible. I got it basically by accident, but I've also been enjoying and play Nexus Blitz so you're in a bit of a tough spot with that one.","replies":[]},{"poster":"the shy top","date":"2019-01-06T02:54:51.905+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"So there's no point in getting it.
