(sometimes lower) which is really good.\r\n- skin customization - you can change the head and body and etc. pretty cool.\r\nthis took like 20 minutes to type i dont know why it took so long","replies":[{"poster":"Edge Of Tommorow","date":"2019-01-08T02:08:09.031+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"There is a setting in the lol client that makes it not close while in game. If you are on a low spec laptop or pc closing the client while in game greatly increases fps while in game. I assume if it takes your computer 5 minutes to wait for the client to relaunch after a game that you are on a low spec computer? But there is definitely a setting that keeps the client open because i used to have to close client on my old computer.                                     Ive tried dota before aswell i personally didnt like the function of the courier, the feel of walking animations or the use of abilities and what annoyed me the most was how dark and gloomy the map feels.","replies":[]},{"poster":"the shy top","date":"2019-01-07T23:07:35.145+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"30 cents??","replies":[]}]}
