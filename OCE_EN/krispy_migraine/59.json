So I played a co op game to test him but he took a long time to clear camps and barely won any 1 v 2 fights against bots. He barely did any damage. So does anyone have any builds that can 1 hit most champs?. And does anyone have any tips for him? I can&#039;t find any 1 hit lee sin guides that are full ad on any of those sites so please help.","replies":[{"poster":"SEKAI","date":"2017-01-12T21:06:55.007+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You only ever need 1 or 2 damage items on Lee because his early game damage is pretty darn broken, then his damage is more manageable as the game goes on. People just learned to abuse the living shit out of his OP early damage spike and go glass cannon early (hence first 1 or 2 items are always damage items) then switch to tankier items later.\n\nThe reason being, his abilities' base numbers, especially Q's, are all pretty over the roof early, and his R is just hilariously broken which for some reason hasn't been seriously reviewed and reworked yet (it roots the target the instant the ability is activated, knock them back, and knockup anyone in the knockback path, and at the same time the damage scales with 200% bonus AD? Really?). Q is just a murder machine because it by the virtue of existing, scales on a target's missing health, meaning the less HP someone has, the quicker Lee can just delete them from the game; clearly a needed bonus for one of the more oppressing duelist and arguably the most potent chaser in the entire game.\n\nAll you need to do is either spam Q until you hit an enemy champ and proceed to assassinate them in 1 rotation or so, or if you still can't hit Q which is one of the fastest and longest-ranged skillshot/gapcloser in the entire game, DON'T WORRY, you can't just W near (may need to practice ward-W combo) and \"no range like point blank\" for your Q. As long as you aren't always using Q as a gapcloser all the time and use it also as a finisher, and remember to AA in-between spams to rack some passive self-synergy, you're doing great already. And at lvl 6, QRQ combo literally already deletes most people who isn't a tank (lasts until a bit later into the game), so it's not like you really need a guide for this champ beyond the basics.\n\nThen again, judging by your inquiries of \"does anyone have any builds that can 1 hit most champs?\" I'm guessing you ain't one of the guys who actually care about others having fun in the game.\n\nSo nah, no cookie for you.","replies":[{"poster":"Krispy Migraine","date":"2017-01-12T21:10:42.689+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"yep, I'm that type of guy. but what jungle item is the best to take?","replies":[{"poster":"SEKAI","date":"2017-01-12T21:27:25.927+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Epixragequit,realm=OCE,application-id=Ntey9fRZ,discussion-id=V8IncHv0,comment-id=00000000,timestamp=2017-01-12T21:10:42.689+0000)\n>\n> yep, I&#x27;m that type of guy. but what jungle item is the best to take?\n\nHis core offence stats are AD/lethality and CDR, you can go figure the rest yourself.\n\nAnd really, while Lee isn't just blatantly broken as he was before, but his design philosophy alone is aggravating due to the fact he always has more shit up his sleeves than others do and the results is that it promotes and encourages some really bad and obnoxious rambo \"me plays\" mentality, in a god damn team game.\n\nIf you wanna Lee, sure whatever, but to play a champion solely because \"I wanna 1 hit everybody\" or in other words \"all me all my glory\", just no. And you'll see, a mindset like that can't get you far in ranked anyway, so if you're using this as a way to boost yourself, oh you'll see.","replies":[{"poster":"Neosinf","date":"2017-01-12T23:33:06.041+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The one time lee sin wins is when he shts on **** purists that think he's an inferior jungle choice","replies":[{"poster":"SEKAI","date":"2017-01-13T01:15:28.205+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Neosinf,realm=OCE,application-id=Ntey9fRZ,discussion-id=V8IncHv0,comment-id=0000000000000000,timestamp=2017-01-12T23:33:06.041+0000)\n>\n> The one time lee sin wins is when he shts on **** purists that think he&#x27;s an inferior jungle choice\n\nNobody has considered Lee an inferior jungle choice ever since the end of S2.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]}
