I've been on OCE since it's first week active and was on NA for a while before that. also, for those of us at 30 when this update hit, a tiny bit of BE shards per level (i kid you not, 220BE from hitting level 32/33) is pathetic, not only did we not get the full refund for our rune bought before the update was announced, but we got told that our loyalty is being shafted (anyone buying runes AFTER the changes were revealed, get full refund, but those of us who had to deal with season 3 and 4 get about 20% of our hard earned IP).\n\nthis agitates me because RITO has created a game that can create psychological addiction in people and those who can't pull themselves away just keep paying RITO to pretty much tell us we are not worth their time.\n\nTL;DR : We are all in an abusive relationship with RITO Game.","replies":[{"poster":"Essembie","date":"2017-11-23T10:09:00.325+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Jerk56kb,realm=OCE,application-id=Ntey9fRZ,discussion-id=nB9s0xbL,comment-id=00010000,timestamp=2017-11-13T21:27:40.431+0000)\n>\n> \n> this agitates me because RITO has created a game that can create psychological addiction in people and those who can&#x27;t pull themselves away just keep paying RITO to pretty much tell us we are not worth their time.\n> \n> TL;DR : We are all in an abusive relationship with RITO Game.\n\nand I fear this new model preys on compulsive behaviours similar to that which drives problem gambling.\n\nIn my eyes this change is an unethical rent-seeking move designed to exploit teenagers.","replies":[]}]}]}]}
