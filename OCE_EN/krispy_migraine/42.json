I got the forced name change back before the oce region existed. Can I still be reported for an offensive name? Would be good to know.. otherwise I'll leave it.","replies":[{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2019-02-18T13:03:28.566+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Honestly, I don't think even \"ThatsBullshit\" would get flagged on OCE. \"ThatsBS\" is ambiguous enough to be a non-issue in my mind, and I would say that's true on NA as well.  Of course, I can't make any guarantees, but I can't see your current name ever being a problem. \n\nCertainly, it's not something that would get you a punishment beyond the name change itself.","replies":[{"poster":"ThatsBS","date":"2019-02-19T18:57:50.518+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thanks, sounds a bit more reassuring.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}
