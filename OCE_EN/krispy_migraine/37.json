Everyone expects you to gank their lane all at the same time because they can't seem to hold their own and when they die because you didn't show up, they blame you. That's on them. Junglers are supposed to gank and secure kills for an ADC/TOP/MID Laner or even themselves but they can't always be relied on for help every single second because you need to kill jungle mobs for experience obv. Just ignore them mate, if you enjoy it without their input on your performance, keep it going.","replies":[]}]}
