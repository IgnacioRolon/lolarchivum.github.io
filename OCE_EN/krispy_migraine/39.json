Now, I play pvp with my friend and oh, boy. If you&rsquo;re someone like me, who&rsquo;s unranked, you&rsquo;ll know how salty your team can get. If you die, &ldquo;omg stop feeding stfu&rdquo;. I am extremely annoyed about how your team can get ultra salty just because you&rsquo;re bad at the game. Maybe you could fix up the matchmaking because my friend and I, who are both unranked, get matched with a silver 5 and a bronze 2. I know that your rank doesn&rsquo;t necessarily represent your skill, but still. I would be happy to be waiting in a queue for longer to get fairer matchups. I&rsquo;m sick of people flaming and saying &ldquo;report&rdquo;\r\n\r\nI get that a lot of people will disagree with me, but it&rsquo;s just my opinion.","replies":[{"poster":"QAPLA","date":"2018-01-09T00:22:42.916+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"My fave comment to make towards these people in post-game chat is \"Why are you playing on OCE if you live in Salt Lake City?\"","replies":[{"poster":"Krispy Migraine","date":"2018-01-09T21:10:06.244+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"YES. \nI am so using this.","replies":[{"poster":"QAPLA","date":"2018-01-09T21:39:06.455+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Epixragequit,realm=OCE,application-id=Ntey9fRZ,discussion-id=dOQXVcux,comment-id=00030000,timestamp=2018-01-09T21:10:06.244+0000)\n>\n> YES. \n> I am so using this.\n\nYou're welcome.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Ingénue","date":"2018-01-09T00:11:16.439+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Unfortunately this is a pretty common experience for everyone. \n\nI am plat and often get flamed by bronze and silver players because I dont live up to their \"high elo expectations\". \nMy personal favourite moment was when a bronze 3 player with a 37% winrate over 400 games told me that if I was plat, they should be challenger. \n\nLike QAPLA said, at the slighest hint of jerk you should just mute the person. It isn't ideal, but it works. If what they said made your game a negative experience, be sure to report them at the end of the game. \nYou can also avoid jerks completely by playing in premade groups (you can look in our [team recruitment board](https://boards.oce.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/team-recruitment), community pages like [Summoners Society](https://www.facebook.com/groups/SummonersSocietyOCE/) and large discords like [this one](https://discord.gg/dbkCJfK). Once again, it isn't really an ideal fix but it does work.\n\nIn the meantime, be the change that you want to see. \nIf someone in your game is struggling, help them out and encourage them instead of turning into a salt lord. \nAsk to play with friendly summoners after your games and make some new friends at the same time :D","replies":[{"poster":"Örnn Bot","date":"2018-01-10T01:14:37.143+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":2,"body":"unfortunately reporting someone like you said doesn't work the only other way you can get bans is rare case the player bot gives you one for no reason or you have used a targeted bad word riots punishment system is the most flawed thing since bungie decided to sell halo","replies":[{"poster":"Ingénue","date":"2018-01-10T04:29:33.630+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"##I'll think you'll find that we only see a negligible amount of punishment cases when people come to discuss their bans on the boards.\n\n** Yes**, the majority of them are the escalation bans for using words that the community has deemed unacceptable, **however **there are still the odd cases here and there where people come to the boards complaining after being punished for \"nothing\", then we learn they are constant low grade ♥ ♥ ♥ ♥ . \n\n[THIS](https://boards.oce.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/gameplay-strategy/7AvNjzRj-2-week-ban?comment=0005) is probably the best memorable example of such a case from the past 12 months. We are even given a rare insight to the comment field on the reports, and we are shown that people don't want this type of constant whining/bitching and blaming in their games and that this type of behaviour is getting reported. Since it is getting reported, and pretty constantly, the IFS does pick up on these sorts of things and learns from it. \n\nPersonally I have had many many friends get banned for this constantly negative, passive aggressive, low key flame. They didn't learn their lessons from being natural escalated through the punishment tiers and ended up losing their accounts which they had sunk some serious time and money in to. They accepted they were ♥ ♥ ♥ ♥ ♥ , and made new accounts. They didn't come to the boards, hence we never heard their stories. Just because you don't hear about punishments doesn't mean they aren't happening.\n\nOf course the system needs some fine tuning and is constantly being worked on and learning to line up with the values of the community that it serves.
