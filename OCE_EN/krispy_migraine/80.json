I thought there wouldn&rsquo;t be a lot of prestige skins and kaisa was gonna be a 1 off. And to get a prestige skin they cost like 100 dollars. I know that people have the choice to buy the skins or not, but one tricks will feel pretty bad when they don&rsquo;t have all the skins for a champ. Plus they should be released as golden chromas in chroma bundles.","replies":[{"poster":"Willy Donka","date":"2019-01-14T04:59:11.624+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Well, Aatrox and the next prestige skins are 100% cash grabs, Prestige KDA Akali and Kai'sa cost under 20 dollars, same as an epic skin, but they actually encourage playing the game. I had fun grinding for KDA prestige Kai'sa with the pass, but now it's just drop 100+ dollars for a skin that is of epic quality, not even ultimate. It's disgusting that riot made aatrox cost that much, let alone even thought about it.","replies":[{"poster":"Lord Sesshomaru","date":"2019-01-14T05:29:19.153+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"You forget that it cost a lot of people a lot more than $20 for Kai'sa.\nSome people like yourself had the luxury of playing as much or as little as you wanted.\n\nOther people have regular commitments, or real life factors that prevent them playing enough to earn the skins (it was a hard grind, I played for hours every day, and only barely made it, and even then I still had to buy some tokens.)\n\nNot to mention that Akali's grind happened over Christmas/new years. where a vast majority of people travel or have to spend lots of time with family.  Thus through no fault of their own, people don't have enough time to sit through the summer break glued to League of Legends for weeks on end, just for a gold chroma.\n\n_(Like honestly, what self-respecting company puts out a massive grind over Christmas?)_\n\nSo many people did fork out money for the hugely overpriced bundles of crap, that was the only way to get more tokens. \n(because a lot of people cant just say _\"Sorry Grandma, it was nice that you travelled across the country to see me, but imma lock myself in my room and grind out 1800 tokens for the next couple'a'weeks\"_) So, just because it didn't cost you personally, doesn't mean many people haven't already been forced to pay this sort of price for previous skins.\n\nIt's been disgusting long before Aatrox.  \nAatrox was just Riot outwardly being greedy in the light of day, instead of loosely trying to hide it.","replies":[{"poster":"Willy Donka","date":"2019-01-16T18:56:11.084+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I actually played only a couple of games every day, even skipped a few days and still managed to get the skin with only the initial pass purchase, It certainly was an absolutely massive grind, but it gave me something to do in the damn game, I also had school during this whole thing, of course 6 hours compared to the amount of time most people have to work... The grind could have been less intense, but it certainly was fun for me to grind with an actual goal for once, I actually had FUN playing the game, compared to ranked grinding for a victorious skin with trolls every single time you get to series.\n\nMay have gone off on a tangent, but again, the grind was definitely pretty huge, but only a couple of games a day and I had the skin a bit before the tokens stopped being earnable. Didn't even start grinding as soon as worlds came out, either. But yes, if you have a job that you're working from really early in the morning to really late in the afternoon, it would be almost impossible to get the skin.\n\nThey should go back to the system they had in place, though. just drop the token cost to maybe half or a third of what it was with Kai'sa, and keep the gains the same. I didn't grind for akali since I didn't play league around christmas, just didn't want to because I wasn't able to purchase the pass and No new skins for any of my mains that made me interested in playing.\n\nJeez this is way too big, and is not at all relevant to anything you said, tend to go off on tangents and make giant text walls that repeat the same thing, woops, not going to delet this though.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"AwkwardKitties","date":"2019-01-11T09:18:05.529+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"While the $100 dollar aatrox skin will certainly bumm out most aatrox mains thats the point of cosmetics.

The skin has no point but to look flashy. People call the new prestige skins a cash grab because they look inferior to ultimate skins but cost more. An obvious low effort chroma but the price of 4-5 ultimate skins? What kind of business is that?
