And I got 1 fps. So I just tried to stay in the game, then after the game, I get a 20 minute leaverbuster. First, it was bots. Second, we still won. And third, I had played around 20 games before my last leaverbuster. Why? Literally 15 minutes of afk = 100 minutes of your life wasted. Really?","replies":[{"poster":"Krispy Migraine","date":"2017-11-23T03:28:29.291+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"This is partly why I hate the game now and left for a while. \nRiot actually need to care about their playerbase instead of money. I actually think this is funny now. ","replies":[]}]}
