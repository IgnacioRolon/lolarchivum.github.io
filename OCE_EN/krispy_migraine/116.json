You can lose every single game, get placed against unbalanced champs, and be forced to keep playing urf to finally complete your missions! And then there&rsquo;s that one unbalanced champ that goes 0/12, so if you&rsquo;re bad at the game, arurf is perfect for you! You can get a op urf champ, and be terrible at the game, then you can get a bad urf champ, and be great at the game! I love arurf! Remember kids, it&rsquo;s much harder to complete your missions without arurf so keep playing it or else you&rsquo;ll never ever get that fancy icon or that fancy orb!","replies":[{"poster":"Socon","date":"2018-06-29T10:50:13.217+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Its not meant to be balanced.
