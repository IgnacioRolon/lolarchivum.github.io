And then you can be that one champ that has no poke abilities, so you go 0/12! Oh how I love how balanced arurf is! And the draft pick queue times are 10x longer! It&rsquo;s fantastic!","replies":[{"poster":"BearGrillz34","date":"2018-06-28T05:46:24.236+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It's pretty cancer, all based on RNG. I don't know how they say the old urf frustrated people. I never e ver got mad in the old urf because I picked that champ myself so I knew the risk. But when u get it in RNG, it pisses me off more than anything. I was this close to alt + f4'ing out of the game and uninstalling. \n\nSo when Riot said that the old urf made people quit, I say ARURF is worse.","replies":[]}]}
