Does it keep carrying on from lpqs?

If you continue leaving/DCing after that, you'll continue to receive 20-minute LPQs. It's entirely possible to drop back through the tiers, but doing so will take months, if not years, for each tier, depending on how consistently you leave/DC in-game.\n\nOne thing to keep in mind is that the game can't distinguish the reason a player DCs from games, and it would be impractical for Riot to even try setting it up as such (such a system could be abused relatively easily). Bottom line is, it can only give so much leniency before taking action, since each game affects 4-9 other players (or 2-5 for TT).\n\nOne thing to note about coop games is that they can become easy once you figure out how the bots work. Their behaviour is generally predictable, and learning how they respond to different situations can allow you to effectively dominate them in-lane even when at a significant disadvantage (something which is rarely possible in PvP). Perhaps the most useful aspect of playing intro bots is that they don't move into lane until the 3-minute mark, time which you can use to your advantage (such as taking your time to last-hit effectively, and planning your first recall accordingly). Generally, once you get an advantage in a coop game, it becomes easy to snowball that into an early win, one important thing is to remember not to be overconfident (which is pretty easy when versing bots).","replies":[]},{"poster":"Chvrche5","date":"2018-12-04T13:13:04.073+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"My sister literally quit the game last year because of the 20 minutes penalties. She had a terrible laptop which crashed often and thus got penalised with five 20 minute wait penalties. Somewhere in those 5 games, her computer crashed again and she got issued more penalties. To the point where she didn't touch her account for months. She got a new laptop and we logged on at one point during the last summer holidays. She was reminded of the outstanding 20 minute penalties, gave up and made us play Overwatch instead. She never touched League again since then.","replies":[{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2018-12-04T14:28:35.184+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"They're based on games not time, so if she never played out the LPQs, they'll still be on the account until those games are played.","replies":[]}]}]}
