Playing. Pvp. A Troll tahm kench was in our team and he kept spitting me onto towers. I rage quitted. This happens a lot in my games and I rage quit. So what I think riot should do about leaverbuster is make it if you don&#039;t leave for let&#039;s say 3 months then it restarts back to 0 games left and 5 min wait. So yeah. This is probably noob posting but srsly, Riot should make the torture less painful.","replies":[{"poster":"The Unseen Inter","date":"2016-09-02T12:44:07.841+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"All i want is a way to tell if i have a buster because half the time i receive one without evening being notified about it so im not even sure if i received one for leaving or not and then i go into a party all ready to have game with no knowledge of my buster and piss off about 1-4 people occasionally even 5 (myself included). I just want to have say a little notification thingy (preferably similar to that of champion disables) to let me know if i have one or not.","replies":[]},{"poster":"SephirothSG","date":"2016-08-30T09:07:39.376+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey there,\n\nThe leaverbuster system does actually have a mechanism built in for tracking and reducing (or increasing) the potential punishment you will receive when leaving a game.\n\nThis is known as your \"Leaver Level\", over time your leaver level will degrade (As long as you play games to completion and do not leave), however when you leave a game your leaver level will increase.\n\nYour leaver level is a hidden value and there is currently no way for you to look this up.","replies":[]}]}
