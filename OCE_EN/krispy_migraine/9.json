Most regrettably purchase I've ever made...\n\nI don't know if they've changed any of it to date, but I'm about 99.99% sure they haven't. Bottom line, the monetisation is skewed way too far into \"all we care about is money\" territory. Other than the \"influx\" of pinatas you get when you first start playing, it's dam near impossible to get them (can manage 1 every other day, if you play several hours per day) and even so, the loot you get from then is usually generically terrible. Get a bunch of low-tier sh!t when what you really need is some mid-tier sh!t so you can \"recycle\" it all just to make a measly amount of progress on upgrading something else so you can sit on the same difficulty for several months at a time...\n\nGenerically terrible game no matter which version you're playing...","replies":[{"poster":"Klavinmour","date":"2018-05-13T00:42:14.168+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Epic Games also refuses to fix the networking issues in their engine because they managed a work around for Fortnite, but if they fixed their engine then PUBG would be more stable and people would flood back to it.\n\nI used to respect Epic Games... used to.","replies":[{"poster":"Project Xayah","date":"2018-05-13T04:19:16.207+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Klavinmour,realm=OCE,application-id=Ntey9fRZ,discussion-id=Iri1MlFP,comment-id=0000000000000000,timestamp=2018-05-13T00:42:14.168+0000)\n>\n> I used to respect Epic Games... used to.\n\nSame.\n\nI remember paying for the early access for Paragon, but didn't end up playing it much, so I requested a refund giving the reason \"I'm not playing as much as I was hoping to\" and they gave me a refund on a $100 purchase (which included friend codes).
