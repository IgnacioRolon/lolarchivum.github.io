There are no OPL/OCS teams with complete roster changes, some of you might be lucky to gain a spot but I very highly doubt you will play in a challenger series or pro league team with all 5. \nAlternatively, you may potentially contact the top open ladder teams right now (DJ Danguards and Xero Empire) to see if they have any spots available. Or perhaps you could contact a challenger series team and purchase their spot, which I believe ranges around $1000.","replies":[]}]}
