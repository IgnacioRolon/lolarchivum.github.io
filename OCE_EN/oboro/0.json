Gangplank. This champions kit is so overpowered its ridiculous. A melee champion who can build full dmg and actually excel in team fights because of it. His ult  annihilates an entire back line on its own with no counter play or zones large area hard. His ability to poke at objectives like baron with his barrel borders insanity. Regardless how fed A gangplank can simply press r and from 1400 units away use his barrels and your squishy is dead or team is pushed off baron.  He can wave clear baron minion in one shot. Has universal map control with his ult. His only down sides is his laning and if he does get smashed he can farm up for 5 minutes with his barrels and be absolutely fine with the extra gold he gets and help out with fights with his ult if necessary. In team games it might be easy to keep him down until victory but in solo q if there is one throw and gangplank is in the game your in for a difficult win.\r\n\r\n2. Kindred. The entire game everyone is playing by her tune. opposition jungler needs to deny stacks. oppisition jungler needs to have a displacement move or her ult is to strong. Team fights everyone just stands in her ult. The entire game revolves around kindred. 1 player. Her Damage is better than that of any adc with full stacks.  Her early game damage and dueling potential makes it difficult to compete for her early game stacks and she chunks down major objectives like no ones business. She is strong early and scales at an s ranking with an extremely broken ult. CC against is pointless late game because she most likely has qss. \r\n\r\n3. Azir. This champion can soley stall a game to victory. His constant dps is insane, his laning pressure is insane, his mobility is insane and he can insec a team from nearly 2000 units away. His strengths are so over the top its absurd. Weakness is he can die to flanks but any frontal enagage is a disaster. One of the longest poking dmg mids in the game with the highest dps in the game with the best disengage in the game. What were riot thinking. Whats with the turret? Does have a high skill cap though. \r\n\r\nAs always this is just my opinion welcome to disagree with it or not. Simply stating if one of these champions get fed it doesnt matter if the other 4 team mates on your team are smashing it. Its going to be absolute struggle street.","replies":[{"poster":"Bromacia","date":"2016-06-26T08:57:13.466+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"This is as inaccurate as it gets bro, counter gp with high mobility or high health, kindred has no serious cc so just cc her or bully her out of her ulti, Azir just got nerfed to the shit, he is also mana hungry as all hell so, please do argue with me","replies":[]},{"poster":"Knuuckles","date":"2016-06-25T08:58:02.231+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"None of the 3 are even in the top 5 at champs currently","replies":[]},{"poster":"TheOneUser","date":"2016-09-22T08:33:37.511+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"that time when i checked na lol ranked and pretty much every top laner in challenger had gp as most played champ{{sticker:zombie-brand-facepalm}}","replies":[]},{"poster":"Worst Vayne","date":"2016-09-22T05:49:22.517+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"as of right now GP is the most overpowered champion in the game","replies":[]},{"poster":"Sulbatamol","date":"2016-06-28T04:34:51.975+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Fuking kind and azir whovere designers came up with the idea, must be extremely selfish and greedy human being.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Fitzky","date":"2016-06-25T06:30:06.952+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Quin is an absolute nightmare, solely because people rarely play her adc anymore and mainly top","replies":[]}]}
