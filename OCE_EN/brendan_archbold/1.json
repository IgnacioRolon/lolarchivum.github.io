This is the second AMA for the series after the eSports team hosted their own AMA last week which you can check out [here](http://boards.oce.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/esports/P2aLfRtk-ask-us-anything-oceanic-esports-team) \r\n\r\nFor those who don&rsquo;t know us, we are Abyss eSports Club, one of the teams competing in the Oceanic Professional League after being promoted from the Challenger Series at the end of Split 1 in 2016. \r\n\r\nToday we will be joined by the following members:\r\n\r\n**Zach &lsquo;Pacman&rsquo; Bayne:** Pacman is the Top Laner for Abyss and has traveled from New Zealand to join the rest of the team in the Sydney Gaming house. After being knocked out of the OPL by Abyss, he was quick to join the team in Split 2 of 2016, where he went on to win the &lsquo;Most Improved Player&rsquo; award. \r\n\r\n**Seb &lsquo;Seb&rsquo; De Ceglie:** Seb is not only the shot caller and team captain but he is also the backbone of the team. With extensive game knowledge and mechanical ability, Seb has proven himself to be a top tier jungler with his performances in Split 1 and 2 of the OPL in 2016. \r\n\r\n**Leon &lsquo;Frae&rsquo; Lee:** Frae is one of the two newest members of the 2017 line up. Previously playing as an Ad Carry for Hellions, Frae has now returned to his primary role as a mid laner and will be looking to prove himself as one of the best mid lane players in the region.   \r\n\r\n**Julian &lsquo;Raid&rsquo; Skordos: **As one of the strongest mechanical players on the team, Julian is the Ad Carry for the team. Constantly trying to improve himself, Julian will be looking to take his gameplay to a whole new level in 2017. Make sure you keep an eye on him, as he is still yet to reach his maximum potential.  \r\n\r\n**Mike &lsquo;Cuden&rsquo; Le:** Our second newest member, Mike is joining the team as our Support player for 2017. Previously playing for both Legacy and Dire Wolves, Mike has brought extensive game player knowledge to the team and has proved to be an invaluable asset. \r\n\r\n**Nick &lsquo;Coach General&rsquo; McKenzie:** Nick at the ripe old age of 17 is the Head Coach of the team. After a proven career in the OCS and being on the Abyss eSports Club roster that was promoted in 2016, Nick looked to focus his skillset as a coach and is really determined to prove himself to the rest of the region after quickly earning the respect of his team.\r\n\r\nWe will be answering questions from **6pm AEDT &ndash; 7pm AEDT** but feel free to post your questions before hand and we will do our best to answer them.\r\n\r\nDon&rsquo;t forget to check out the in game store as the 2017 Team Icons have just gone on sale. Currently at a cheap price of 187 RP each, you can pick up any of the 8 OPL team&rsquo;s icons to help support your favorite team.","replies":[{"poster":"BMR Windows","date":"2017-01-20T06:16:18.665+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hi there, This is a question for @Raid\n\nWhat is your official opinion on the young, talented up and coming support player \"im tilting\"?","replies":[{"poster":"Repsforjesuss","date":"2017-01-20T07:17:10.603+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Superstar.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"mysterytomato","date":"2017-01-20T05:47:28.673+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"Who is the best player on the team and why is it Pacman?","replies":[{"poster":"Abyss Pacman","date":"2017-01-20T07:23:44.102+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Appreciate the support friend :^) \nI think the rest of the team would agree with me when I say I'm clearly the best because I have the balls to play the most difficult and intensely mechanical champions, like my feared Nasus and dreaded Tahm Kench.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Abyss Seb","date":"2017-01-20T07:17:30.344+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"His charm, his looks, his smile","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Rogue1","date":"2017-01-20T05:25:41.605+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"***","replies":[{"poster":"Squire Pug","date":"2017-01-20T05:33:59.755+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"How will Sin cope with their 1-9 record for Split 1?","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Squire Pug","date":"2017-01-20T05:33:24.998+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"HUGE Pacman fan, and highly rate him as a player.\n\nIs he the spiritual and mental centre of the team like I think he is?\n\nAlso how well is everyone shucking the baggage from previous teams?

It's definitely harder said than done, especially for younger players who don't like to lose.\n It also helps that by now the one thing i'm very practiced at is losing :P So I'd like to think my previous experience on losing teams have helped me focus on what's needed to improve as a player and as a team.

GP has a pretty strong lane phase once you get sheen, you just need to play really cautious around champs who all in like riven/darius. If you poke them constantly with your Q you will get them low pretty easily, just make sure you can get away from them when your Q is down. I would recommend sitting on a barrel, and using your AUTO(not Q) to proc it to slow/run away if they jump on you. You can then Q them when you get some distance.\n There's a lot of tricks you can do with barrel chains, id suggest looking up some youtube guides. Just remember that your goal is to get through lane phase and finish triforce, so try to avoid risky all ins and play around the enemy jungler.\nFor lane bullies i would recommend trying out darius and olaf. They are both really strong against other melees in lane.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"April","date":"2017-01-20T08:28:50.237+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"@raid what shampoo do you use?","replies":[{"poster":"Repsforjesuss","date":"2017-01-20T08:42:43.299+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"L'Or√©al z87 Turbo Hydration.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"belquin","date":"2017-01-20T08:14:57.123+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"What do you guys think your biggest asset is as a team, what I mean is - which part of your game is the strongest - Meta play?

It&#x27;s amazing.\n\nBecause we only formed as this 5 man roster around a month ago, we're still gelling together as a team, but i'll do my best to answer your question.\n\n From an individual level, everyone matches up very well even against the top tier of Oceania, the Tally's, Spookz's, Swiffer's of the league. I think the players, to watch out for are definitely Raid and Seb. Over the off-season Raid has transitioned from a self-sufficient ADC to a very strong laning and hyper carry ADC. The other player to watch out for is Seb, with the meta making jungler's relative strength higher, Seb's aggressive play style has been \"buffed\" in a sense. Pacman, Frae and Cuden, are definitely very strong players in their own right, so i'm optimistic about our chances this coming split.\n\nI think mechanically and laning the players can definitely go blow to blow with the best, it'll just be up to myself and Sype Nav (assistant coach and analyst), to mould the team to cohesively work together as a unit and develop their macro play.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"The Stinky Stank","date":"2017-01-20T07:07:48.102+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Is claire as good as hes hyped to be? and can Frae handle him?","replies":[{"poster":"Coach General","date":"2017-01-20T07:35:37.594+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=The Stinky Stank,realm=OCE,application-id=ATM3HYki,discussion-id=F2G122fB,comment-id=0019,timestamp=2017-01-20T07:07:48.102+0000)\n>\n> Is claire as good as hes hyped to be? and can Frae handle him?\n\nClaire is definitely a very strong mid laner and one of the best mechanical players Oceania has to offer, there's a reason why he's hyped. It's really going to come down to how he performs at lan however, but Claire definitely has the potential to dethrone Swiffer as oce's best mid laner. I have the utmost faith in Frae that he will match up fine against Claire, you won't have to wait long to find out though, we play Legacy week 2!","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Quadez","date":"2017-01-20T06:15:56.654+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hello Raid, this is Harrison, Ryans friend, how did you become the mechanical biblical god that you're currently known as?

Every support zyra will max her snare first and her ultimate is a very strong zoning ability. Malzahar has one of the strongest disables with his ultimate and forces enemies to purchase Quicksilver Sash. The changes to Rylai's Crystal Scepter was a big buff to these AP supports as well. This  meta is alot of fun for me because it is very satisfying topping the damage graphs as a support.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Repsforjesuss","date":"2017-01-20T07:13:25.928+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hi ! i think the only reason the role struggles is because courage of the colossus champs can easily duel adcs.
