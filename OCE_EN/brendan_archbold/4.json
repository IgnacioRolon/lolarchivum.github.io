Our aim at Abyss Esports is to help improve the esports community by interacting with the lower player base to promote healthy game play.\r\nWe understand that we might not be able to catch every single smurf but we are confident our system can detect 95% of them. Here are some of the things we are doing to help prevent smurfs. Some of our main ways of detection cannot be revealed for security purposes.\r\n\r\n-Double Elimination: If teams are unlucky and run into smurfs in the early rounds of the tournament, they are knocked down into a second bracket to make sure they still have a chance at winning the main prize\r\n-Prizes: The prizes are only awarded to the players in the team and cannot be transferred to another account\r\n-Spectate: We will have admins spectating as many matches as possible to pay attention to anyone raising red flags on our system\r\n\r\nGood luck and dont forget to check us out on facebook! www.facebook.com/AbyssEsportsOCE","replies":[{"poster":"Best Kalista KR","date":"2015-09-22T13:48:28.204+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"How many games will we play / what happens if a winner isn't decided by the end of the day?","replies":[{"poster":"Brendan Archbold","date":"2015-09-24T06:09:35.031+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Sorry for not getting back to you sooner!\n\nThere is around 6 rounds for the day and should conclude around 7pm AEST.
