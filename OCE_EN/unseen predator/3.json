SO maybe the nerfs were enough.\n\nLissandra is strong but she has her weaknesses, although her build path kinda negates some of these. Range and poke beats her really badly but that's about all I can think of, she is definitely a strong one.\n\nLB from personal experience is completely fine if I get to counterpick her, but of course that's strictly laning phase, she kinda just does whatever the fuck she wants for the rest of the game though and no one can do anything about it.","replies":[{"poster":"RLG Shaky","date":"2015-03-15T15:08:42.695+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"riven- if you use renekton you beat them 99.98% of the time in lane, although i won't denied the fact that she is to broken, 2 abilities that are get aways, a stun and a knock up as well as a ranged ult and this is all with low cd and no mana or energy.\n\nnidalee- i don't know if you are joking or not because nid is op and broken, all you need to do is land one bloody spear and then lion form and head smash your keyboard and you win, and then once you get fed and have full build, once you hit a spear its like a 1 hit knock out. nerf her lion form... oh and she also has a heal.\n\nirelia- the fact that you say she is okay is completely wrong, she is one of the most strongest people i have ever mained, and for that reason i stopped playing her, she has amazing sustain with her W and R she then has a gap closer which resets when you kill the champion or creep, her stun, oh dear lord her stun, is seriously long enough to make myself a sandwich and eat it before it runs out (obviously a exaggeration). oh and she hasn't been nerfed since 2012... so yeah thats a thing, but her damage spike is when she gets triforce, from there on all you need is tank and BOFTRK and your set and can sustain enough for a 4v1 without the other team having no stuns.\n\nkat- f.u.c.k that champ. delete the no skilled bitsh\n\nlissandra- don't play her at all , played a few, first time i got rolled but then i learned to dodge the Qs and i was all good, but she is a very strong champ, i dot think any nerds need to made personally, because she does take a remote amount of skill to play, timing your ult and onto who, whether to go in on your claw jump thing (don't know what ability it is) just all these things, but she is a hard champ to verse is they are good.\n\nvi- my favourite champ because this bitsh is F'ing broken, bloody shreds up armour like it is nothing, vi has gap closer, her W is amazing, and her E is just gross that it stacks up and just shreds health like its nothing. i love vi because she is the only champ i can play jungle with cause i hate jungle but i normally get jungle when in ranked.\n\nleblanc- ARE YOU ON DRUGS MATE, THIS CHAMP IS BLOODY NUTS, THE HIGH DAMAGE, AMAZING DUKE POTENTIAL AND THE SNARES, F THAT %%%%, DELETE THAT OP SON OF A B****H, LIKE DAMN SON, BLOODY THING JUMPING AROUND THE JOINT LIKE SHE SOME BLOODY FROG... EHHHHHH\n\nin general all these champs this person has said are amazingly op, can carry teams and delete enemy teams in seconds. he has a point, and to answer this guys question, you will never get a game without these champs, in ranked now all i pick is Renekton due to he's ability to just destroy riven and out sustain her because so many people play her cause she is broken, got to love the top lane life :D","replies":[{"poster":"Olee","date":"2015-03-16T01:26:27.427+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"Your post made me laugh so much xD Too good brother xD \n\nIdk, maybe I'm just speaking from a personal experience point of view and probably just in laning phase.

If you could stop her ult, cool beans let her be broken yo ucan stop her ult, but Malphite was nerfed and allowed him to be CC'd for the same fucking reason, his engage was to powerful. Vi is just.. Malphite 2.0 with steroids. SHe can essentially lock your ADC out of the fight for 3 seconds, the adc has to try and kite her as she 90/0's them within 2 seconds so your adc is gone as your team turns o nVi as she just fists your team with no drawback because she clicked your ADC. At least Malphites could be dodged, the only way to dodge Vi's ult is to zhonya and adc's don't build that shit.","replies":[{"poster":"Antodara","date":"2015-03-18T04:15:34.872+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You see, all that requires your ADC to be within range, before an engage.
