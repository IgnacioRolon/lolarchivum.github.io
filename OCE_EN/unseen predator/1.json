Whatever, ill perma ban her once i get back to Diamond after this reset is done.","replies":[{"poster":"Excited","date":"2015-01-17T10:41:04.620+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"not to worried about riven changes tbh.. what concerns me are those ahri changes...","replies":[{"poster":"Arcanopulse","date":"2015-01-17T12:06:46.362+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=FruitSalad,realm=OCE,application-id=Ntey9fRZ,discussion-id=fEEOZFkz,comment-id=0002,timestamp=2015-01-17T10:41:04.620+0000)\n>\n> not to worried about riven changes tbh.. what concerns me are those ahri changes...\n\nWhat concerns me is that Ahri just got a skin. Meanwhile, Urgot, and plenty of other champions are crying in a corner, feeling neglected.

However I like her more and think she is quiet balanced because you can still play around a fed riven compared to a fed akali/fizz/kat whom would just wreck the whole team no matter what.\n\n","replies":[{"poster":"Samurai Jin","date":"2015-01-17T14:41:59.338+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Full build Riven is a decent duelist tbh, she excels at 100-0. she just struggles against armor stackers like Rammus/Maokai/Mundo/Malphite/Cho...","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"P1 GTR","date":"2015-01-17T12:07:25.891+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"how about them tristana changes, SNAZZAY","replies":[]},{"poster":"Niji","date":"2015-01-17T11:39:06.468+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I was worried because I didn't want Riven to be easier/stronger but I read a Riot response on the matter\n\nSource:http://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/gameplay-balance/R12g5sUE-broken-wings-q-now-auto-cancels-its-animation-allowing-riven-to-attack-much-faster-after-using-q?comment=000c\n**Meddler:This is an unexpected change from some of the fixes in 5.1 to Overlapping CC effects (Riven's lockouts, which were blocking her from auto attacking automatically at once previously, use some of the same system that governs CC).
