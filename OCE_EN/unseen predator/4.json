Maybe, just maybe if you didn't troll, you wouldn't be so bad and you wouldn't be in elo hell? Granted these trolls are probably kids like 15 years old and there brain isn't fully developed, but still, this is kinda why a kick option in lobby and a harsher punishment for trolls is a good idea.\r\n\r\nDoing the honors of dodging for the other players is startin to get a little annoying.","replies":[{"poster":"Chalze","date":"2015-01-29T23:55:13.003+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"SCIENCE B!TCH\n\nNo one's brains are fully developed till around over 18 :D","replies":[{"poster":"Unseen Predator","date":"2015-01-30T07:31:28.410+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"Last i checked your brain isn't fully developed till your 21.","replies":[{"poster":"Chalze","date":"2015-01-30T07:50:40.795+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"lol i dunno i made it up xDD","replies":[{"poster":"Unseen Predator","date":"2015-01-30T13:23:21.812+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Idk either i just heard it was 21, cant remember where i heard it from though.","replies":[{"poster":"PovSack","date":"2015-02-02T06:01:28.880+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"25","replies":[]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"HORSE OF FORCE","date":"2015-01-29T23:10:03.699+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":">an Ezreal that decides to troll and builds a Triforce and Gauntlet\n\nIf I had a dollar for every time I was versing an Ezreal who used this build and won...","replies":[{"poster":"Riso","date":"2015-01-30T10:41:01.320+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I had a game where they brought lich bane in aswell XD","replies":[]},{"poster":"You are loved","date":"2015-01-30T06:08:58.691+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"i cri evritem","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"SEKAI","date":"2015-01-29T14:49:45.352+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"My placement was alright (got silver 3 in the end), it was actually competitive for the most part and I liked it quite a bit. I was like \"man why haven't I joined ranked by now, I was missing out so much\".\n\nThen out into the actual Ranked:\n\n* First game out of placement, there wasn't actually trolls per se, just a lot of typing between the 2 teams and ofc inside the team, and you know how it would end up, it became a blame fest that discouraged people and all that. \n\n* Second game was both top and mid lane feeding going something like 0/3/0 and 1/5/0 by like 10 min mark, then they just started to go negative attitude no matter what I say/encourage so we lost that one. \n\n* Third game I got so sick of supporting I went Yi mid, did make a few mistakes here and there though but the most major problem was that enemy team had 3 fotm/meta picks that were just so good we would get our arses kicked the instant team fight started. It wasn't fun by any stretch of the imagination. Our team wasn't the most efficient in some categories and we got wiped, hard and it is just not enjoyable to see normal team comp stands NO CHANCE against tryhards.\n\nSo yer I was like \"Nope\" and now I am giving Ranked a rest, hoping the scar wears off so I can go back to it again.\n\nI mean I sorta like Ranked, it has banning and counter picking which I, while not the biggest fan of it, like the concept and hope to see that in my games.","replies":[{"poster":"Riso","date":"2015-01-30T10:44:22.098+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=SEKAI,realm=OCE,application-id=Ntey9fRZ,discussion-id=x8ANMUyT,comment-id=0000,timestamp=2015-01-29T14:49:45.352+0000)\n> \n> I mean I sorta like Ranked, it has banning and counter picking which I, while not the biggest fan of it, like the concept and hope to see that in my games.\n\nNormal Draft plz","replies":[{"poster":"SEKAI","date":"2015-01-30T11:26:48.797+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Still waiting for that.","replies":[{"poster":"Dawaraven","date":"2015-01-31T01:02:06.010+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yeah its funny because in norms you often go against a team thats gnar top kat mid j4 jungle and leo/graves bot.\n\nWhereas in rank gnar, kat j4 would most likely be banned.
