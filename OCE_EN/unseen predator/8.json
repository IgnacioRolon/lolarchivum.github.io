It all depends on which setting you choose when you create the account. If you pick 'beginner' you will be matched with other beginners of the same level (occasionally you do play against a smurf being a ♥♥♥♥ with a mejais stomping the noobs like beginner bots, but not that often. If you pick 'veteran', that is where you get these toxic smurfs, feeding and generally being ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥. It's also where you get the messed up matchmaking because it assumes knowledge of the game (ignoring lack of runes and masteries). If you pick 'expert' then you get even more smurfs, every game is like a normal game but without runes and masteries because everybody knows what they are doing. Matchmaking here is even stranger because you can be level 17 and get matched up with gold+ in norms. \n\nBTW, with those games... you got trolled by tryn ♥","replies":[]},{"poster":"TheOneUser","date":"2015-01-13T23:55:30.013+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"if your \"smurfing\" it doesn't matter...just go top steal trynd cs and solo carry anyway","replies":[{"poster":"Unseen Predator","date":"2015-01-14T00:55:07.595+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The lack of exp is a pain tho especially when there's other smurfs as well, and i wouldn't want a new player going 1v2 bot lane, that's just not fair for them.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"KingDinger","date":"2015-01-13T23:22:53.475+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"so....1 person? your issue is one person picks tryn in the role you called...maybe stop calling and just pick when all the trolls are done.","replies":[{"poster":"Unseen Predator","date":"2015-01-14T00:54:15.690+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Maybe, and this is just a thought, i was using an example?
