I believe you need a good support but Gosu/Dlift might say otherwise. I mean you don't need a good support to be able to peel for yourself in teamfights, but to get through laning on top/ahead. it's a bit hard. If all lanes feed it's also hard to do anything that game.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"og1764","date":"2015-10-09T16:52:23.124+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hi :)\nWhat other ADC's do you like to play?\nWhich do you hate to lane against?\nWhat sort of CS do you aim to get by 10 minutes?
