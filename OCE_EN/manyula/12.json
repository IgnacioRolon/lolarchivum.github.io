For months, I was sad, but I was always able to get my mind off of it with League. Of course, masking it never completely took away the pain and sadness would return that night; or if not that night, the next night, or the next week. I think I could legitimately say that I was depressed for the better part of half a year. \n\nThe realization that it's time for both of you to move on is both difficult to accept, yet necessary for beginning to feel better. Personally, it took me a little over six months to no longer long for the past. Sure, we had good times, but we all have to move forward; my friends, new and old, helped me reach this point and while I can't say I've never been happier, I can say that I'm doing a hell of a lot better than I was last year.  \n\nIf you'd like someone to talk to, I'm always on [**Discord**](http://wrenchmen.org/invite) (unless I'm sleeping or in class) and sometimes on the client. It gets better, and I hope that you feel better soon. \n\nWishing you all the best,\nWuks","replies":[]},{"poster":"GigaPube","date":"2016-01-27T15:57:15.018+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"who cares didnt you get a smurf insta-plat with just ashe was it? thats some good shit m8, if he was any less than challenger he isnt worthy","replies":[{"poster":"Manyula","date":"2016-01-27T16:22:45.949+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"wow you remembered me <3 it was this account and i got it to diamond in 101 games soloQ <3  i had a 22 wins 2loss ratio on ashe thanks for cheering me up bb x{{sticker:slayer-jinx-wink}}","replies":[{"poster":"GigaPube","date":"2016-01-27T18:35:01.334+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"TSM Danklight Vayne: The Documentary - Coming Soon to a cinnamon near you","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"lordofrage","date":"2016-01-27T10:34:27.917+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"***","replies":[{"poster":"Olee","date":"2016-01-27T10:36:52.224+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"We don't even know the reason yet...","replies":[{"poster":"Manyula","date":"2016-01-27T12:38:21.261+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"just ignore this child, he is a troll.","replies":[{"poster":"Olee","date":"2016-01-27T14:27:28.004+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"wait as in me? or lordofrage?","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"lordofrage","date":"2016-01-27T10:43:45.340+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Olee,realm=OCE,application-id=Ntey9fRZ,discussion-id=xYtllMbj,comment-id=00000000,timestamp=2016-01-27T10:36:52.224+0000)\n>\n> We don't even know the reason yet...\n\nolee was it u","replies":[]}]}]}]}
