I went 6/4 with my provisionals playing strictly adc, vayne and ashe only. I feel like at low elo the games are so team reliant and so hard to win games by just being a good player by myself. I have played low elo before and carried games ez pz as other champs, other lanes but adc is real tough lol . Advice to anyone stuck in low elo, don&#039;t adc till you hit high gold/plat.\n\nUnless ofcourse you have a duo partner :p","replies":[{"poster":"VENI VIDI VICI","date":"2015-09-24T06:24:13.082+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"That's interesting... I've never had a problem as of yet with climbing in low elo but I find jungle to be the easiest to carry from. No one knows how the hell to jungle in low elo.. They might have a chance at being slightly better at most roles but in jungle no one has a clue.","replies":[{"poster":"DW GunGale","date":"2015-09-24T07:42:28.267+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Don't forget Jungling has the biggest control of the game.

Anyways, i feel this season adc is harder to carry from lower elos  as i main the role. \nwhere did you get placed going 6/4 on a fresh level 30? just out of interest.\n\nMid/jungle would be the better roles as a smurf in our elos. someone who when ahead, cannot be beaten easily. {{champion:7}} {{champion:92}} ect.\nGl with the climb mate. always up for a duo too if your on your way up :)\nAus Dave","replies":[{"poster":"Manyula","date":"2015-09-24T23:07:16.035+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Got placed Silver 3, high mmr, here is a screenshot of one of my silver 3 games: http://puu.sh/klW1P/cbf333ca38.png  (we won)\n\nSkipped silver 2, currently in silver 1 promos, Always in game with low plats/high golds.

We want to have the draft pick experience making it feel real, as well as have no consequences for losing if we DO happen to play poorly.
