It's just like empowering self-harmers, I know I had my work cut out for me when I was trying to cut myself at a Mental Institute, without access to anything remotely capable of that good feeling I was looking for and later after trying to slash my wrists with a smashed bottle was strapped down to a bed for days while being drugged heavily; yet the same joy people get from smoking is O.K; even though it's harmful and is proven to increase the chance of developing Cancer?\n\nIt's not about the money.\n\nYou're not constructive in the slightest and even when you think you are, you're simply missing the point that is expressions aren't always relatable. I'm sure you can't relate to me liking the feeling of cutting myself or being happy about the concept of all my blood spilling out onto the pavement several times and repeatedly wanting this; so when someone makes a quote or something: keep your word to yourself please - unless it's nice; It serves no purpose but to bully and people die because of bullying, both as a direct result of and as a response to - plus it's sadistic and represents enjoying other peoples pain which is evil and serves no purpose, deserves no place in and will not be tolerated in this world.","replies":[{"poster":"Manyula","date":"2015-12-20T23:33:25.033+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"kys","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"ViolinMaker53","date":"2015-12-20T16:35:46.789+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"xx","replies":[]}]}
