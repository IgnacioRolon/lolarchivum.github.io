New meta is always lame, change is always depressing, just like when they made jungle camps super strong, it still bugs me. So I can't really have a valid input on either the ADC rework or the new champion, Kindred. I do believe an ADC is extremely reliant on their support, on this account, I struggled to carry every game early because supports wouldn't peel and it made games harder. However with that being said I don't think it's ever okay to blame a support for your death, whether it be in lane or in teamfights. All your deaths are preventable by different positioning.\n\nThe teleport meta is annoying and the pressure it gives can affect the lane dramatically, however it's still fairly even if your toplaner is on the same page too. The teleport toplaners aren't a problem. Neither with the roaming mids.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Bipolar","date":"2015-09-28T14:53:28.438+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Telecasterdude,realm=OCE,application-id=Ntey9fRZ,discussion-id=EbaaHfvE,comment-id=0000,timestamp=2015-09-26T23:38:38.791+0000)\n>\n> Best ADC in OCE?

For the past few months I've been maining adc as much as possible, but sometimes I feel that I can't orbwalk/stutterstep etc as well as I should be able to. Not sure if it's laziness or I need to put my mouse sensitivity up.. May I ask what mouse you own and what settings you have in place for it in regards to dpi and other possible acceleration settings. Cheers for reading, friend.","replies":[{"poster":"Manyula","date":"2015-09-27T07:24:20.139+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"mouse speed in league set to 70%, and my dpi is 1800. No acceleration. My mouse is a Razer Naga, but I wouldn't bother getting a mouse because it doesn't affect gameplay unless you use the mouse numbers for items (ward jumping) which i dont because adc main. I use them for taunt/emote spam. \n\nThis isn't for everyone but I've gotten used to it and it is really helpful for me, I set attack-move click to my left mouse click, right click is walk.  MB3 is to click on objects (Towers/Champions/MovingMap) Look up a guide to do that if interested as you need to do it in the configuration folders. \n\nAt first this was a problem because if i missclicked someone i'd attack the closest thing, and being a vayne player it proved a massive problem. My accuracy became better and in the long run it is helpful, it stops me from walking into the enemy when a missclick does occur.","replies":[{"poster":"VENI VIDI VICI","date":"2015-09-27T14:14:54.238+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thanks for the reply man.
