These tickets are designed to verify ownership of the account, so it will ask a whole bunch of questions. You don't have to answer all of them, but essentially you have to provide sufficient proof that you are the original owner of the account. \n\nIf you feel you have been unable to answer many of those specific questions, any information that is *unique* to the account, but not *visible* on the account is useful for this. For example, knowing you purchased x bundle for x skin the day it came out (assuming it is not in your purchase history and hasn't been for some time) is useful, a list of skins you own is not.\n\nOnce ownership has been established, you can begin the discussion to get your account restored. There are things that will exempt you from recovery (for example, as you guessed having ever shared the account will generally result in this). I also say all of this with knowledge of how this functions for the *Oceanic* region, and while I have no reason to believe things are done differently on NA, there may be some distinction.","replies":[]}]}
