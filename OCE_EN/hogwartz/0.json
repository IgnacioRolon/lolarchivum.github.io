My heart is sad. I took off work to play that mode with my friends and honestly was super disappointed it wasn't out. Anyways, I understand why they did this Draven thing. It was a prefect April fools, \"got yea\". Everyone expecting 'URF Mode' and then they do something totally different/terrible. You got me RIOT but it just sorta hurt. Kinda like when your best friend thinks it would be funny to pull the chair out underneath you but then you wind up breaking your tailbone and crying. I had money's saved up to buy skins to go hard on 'URF Mode' but I guess I'll just find something else to do with this time off.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Phyl","date":"2016-04-01T21:00:52.528+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"how has no one figured out that Riot's been planning on having URF the whole time?

But people say all the time that they wish urf was year round. So if they flake on us and just do some stupid draven gig... People will flame. Plus no one even plays  Draven, ATLEAST do it for his brother Darius. People actually play  him! Idk if its just me but the the Draven minion heads make it weird to see their health bars.
