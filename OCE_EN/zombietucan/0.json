Honestly, can you imagine it? Wholy shit! No thank you very much. Muting people but still having to deal with their noob ping spam is enough for me let alone being forced to mute every retarded monkey every game.\n\nIf you can't listen to other people's pings or look at your minimap there is something else wrong other than no voice comms. That's just understanding the basics of the game.","replies":[{"poster":"Fitzky","date":"2017-02-07T08:03:35.407+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I think you're taking this too much into the ranked perspective, because yes we all do become a little more triggered when our precious LP is at stake. League does well indeed have a VERY toxic community, which is why we are taking steps to try and improve it, so why don't we just test this out and see? Maybe it could make people rage more, or maybe it could improve teamwork and make people less likely to get triggered? We can't really decide until Riot actually attempts it.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Fitzky","date":"2017-02-06T11:59:37.279+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":2,"body":"Yes definitely, I actually have a very long paragraph explaining why but I'll cover the basic overview.\n\nThe most powerful argument against having voice chat is: \"It'll only make League more toxic\", but lets look at it in more depth. Ask yourself \"What is the biggest reason for toxicity in League?\" Usually it's because that one guy ran straight into a 1v5, or because someone wasn't looking at the minimap and got 3 man ganked. Basically a lot of the flame comes off of people getting angry at other people failing. (With the rest coming usually from cross-team chat about \"That one champ that's op and broken\"). So now think about what could help people from failing & flaming less? Maybe if there was a better way of communicating to your team then maybe people wouldn't be making stupid mistakes so often? And I can tell you a good amount of people would definitely rather speak a sentence then stand there and quickly type it out in chat (How many times have you suddenly stopped to type in chat then immediately jumped on?). And even if there is that one kid who just likes to abuse voice and scream whenever he dies, there is always the trusty **MUTE** button, just like every other game....","replies":[{"poster":"Nightjar","date":"2017-02-06T16:54:20.687+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"although you then have the issue with people who don't know how to use voicecomms properly and with everyone talking at the same time.
