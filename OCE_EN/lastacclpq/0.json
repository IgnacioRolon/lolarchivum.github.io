He told me during that particular there was a master yi named [REMOVED - [REPORTING OTHER PLAYERS](http://boards.oce.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/announcements/BjArMH2B-boards-universal-rules)] who was 0/24 and he was genuinely frustrated since the other players kept flamming at him for dying against fed opponents will not giving even a second glance to the yi. He is a usually a kind and respectful player who is valuable to the league of legends community. Upon looking at [REMOVED] op.gg it can be seen that he was able to play more games and is not banned, what is this double standard from Riot? Im a very busy person and can only play league this week since i am on annual leave from work, i probably won't be able to play it for another six months since my job consumes most of my time. I ask you Riot to kindly unban my account due to the extenuating circumstances mentioned above.","replies":[{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2019-04-17T08:42:34.477+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Account sharing alone is against the ToS for pretty much just this reason. It isn't typically punished unless it is being used maliciously (for boosting or some such), but ultimately the account is held responsible for actions taken on it. \n\nIt would be pretty short-sighted of Riot to allow \"oh but it was my friend playing on the account\" as a viable excuse for negative behaviour. Someone has to take responsibility for those actions and so it falls to the account that you shouldn't be sharing in the first place.\n\nAs for the punishment itself, \"they started it\" isn't a valid defence. You're perfectly entitled to be frustrated with an intent feeder, not so entitled to abuse them, adding fuel to the fire and further ruining the game for everyone else.\n\nTo be clear, things that are NOT relevant to the punishment:\n\n* It was your friend playing on the account.\n* Your friend isn't normally toxic.\n* Someone in that game was intent feeding.\n\nThings that ARE relevant to the punishment:\n\n* **You** shared the account.\n* The content of the chat log you would have received in the reform card.\n\nA punishment will not be removed unless it was made in error, but if you still wish to appeal it you can do so through player support: https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/requests/new","replies":[{"poster":"LastAccLPQ","date":"2019-04-17T09:12:10.078+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":5,"body":"I'm not going to argue with you but there is nothing stopping me from making a new account if you ip ban me then i can still use a vpn.

Any further violations on the account will result in permanent suspension. The idea is you say \"oh shoot if I'm not careful I'm going to lose this account that I've sunk time and effort (and possibly money) into, I should get my shit together\".\n\nIf you haven't had any punishments on the account before, then you're friend used no tolerance language (hate speech, suicide encouragement, that ilk) so that's why all the fuss.\n\nAs a general rule Riot don't stop people creating new accounts, but new accounts also tend to see punishment for bad behaviour faster.","replies":[]}]}]}]}
