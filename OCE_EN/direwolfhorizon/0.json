But i noticed they no longer display ranks and now display only the level of the summoner whilst hovering the account in your friends list. I thought that Riot should still somehow incorporate the rank displayed on the account and possibly even honor level and what not... Here&#039;s a small edit I made to display both. I also had another idea shown below that could even display their most played champion/main champion on their account.\r\n\r\n_**Profile Highlights #1 - No Champion Main Highlight**_\r\nhttps://drive.google.com/file/d/0B0H3YChL2-8YU1NMZ1ZBWTE0MkU/view?usp=sharing\r\n\r\n**_Profile Highlights #2 - Champion Main Highlight_**\r\nhttps://drive.google.com/file/d/0B0H3YChL2-8YRXVCR2J4UnBFUG8/view?usp=sharing\r\n\r\nThese are not accurate to the current account, but it is all for the creative features and main ideas of the highlights for an account.","replies":[{"poster":"Time Criminal","date":"2017-10-22T06:30:44.741+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I like the first one, but the second one seems a bit much.
