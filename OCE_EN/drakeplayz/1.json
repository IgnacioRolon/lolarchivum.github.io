I pronounced it accidently as \"Tahm Cash\" and I thought it would make for a great skin. Just have tahm kench with a suit and everything like a mafia boss or something, his little tentacles on his face (whatever they are) can be like a moustache or something and when he spits out a minion or champion the spit on the floor can be money or something. Maybe the stacks that he places on champions can be dollar bills and when he uses his ult he sucks again money or dollar bills instead of the regular spit balls and blue mist. Just an idea to put out there, let me know what you think","replies":[{"poster":"GalW101","date":"2016-06-18T09:18:58.464+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Sounds great, looking forward to buying the skin","replies":[]}]}
