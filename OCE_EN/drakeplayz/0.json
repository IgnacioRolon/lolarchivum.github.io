I have a 27inch monitor and it is just so small, I would like it not to be fullscreened but to have the option to maximize the client window, or for it to be resizeable so I am able to adjust it to fit my screen. Still waiting for Riot to reply to me, it has been months, no reply :(\n\nEDIT: Should we post up a poll on the alpha client/normal boards and see if we can get a following on this? Hopefully then Riot will respond.

Open Control Panel. (View by: Category)\n2. Under _Appearances and Personalization_, click on _Adjust screen resolution_.\n3. Change your resolution.\n\n> [{quoted}](name=SK1TZO,realm=OCE,application-id=PpTM71nT,discussion-id=EmdiArd0,comment-id=0000,timestamp=2016-08-04T09:46:26.675+0000)\n>\n> i agree, i was hoping for a full screen client (without changing my desktop res) even if i could just resize it to full screen\n\nI wanted a full screen client as well (especially with the new design in full screen). I don't think Riot will do it though, somethings may be 'inconvenient' that way, like having to Alt + Tab to reply to a message, opposing to having a small chat window.\n\n{{champion:17}}","replies":[]}]}
