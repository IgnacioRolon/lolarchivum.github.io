Some people just aren't able to get a stable connection to the riot server from their location, others can. In this case it isn't a server wide issue so you don't have loss prevented. \n\nGG no challenger for you ♥","replies":[]},{"poster":"Chalze","date":"2015-03-22T06:57:00.306+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You have 2 DCs in your game.

But it's got nothing to do with matchmaking in general.","replies":[]}]}
