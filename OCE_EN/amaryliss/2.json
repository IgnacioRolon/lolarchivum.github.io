Lately I&#039;ve been having TONNES of random lag spikes(I&#039;m with Telstra at the moment btw) and it&#039;s really been affecting my gameplay and of course my teammates who have to put up with the bad plays I&#039;m making:/ Whenever I check in customs it&#039;s no problem but once I actually get into a game my ping just gets higher and higher and higher, it occassionally drops but always goes back up again, also I&#039;m the only one using the wifi(99% of the time) so it&#039;s not a &#039;sharing between family&#039; problem. As the title suggests, could you guys suggest any good internet companies/plans please? It would help me sooo much(and the people playing with me), thanks!:)","replies":[{"poster":"Mindstar","date":"2016-01-18T04:24:44.814+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hi,\n\nAs SephirothSG suggests - before changing ISPs, I'd highly recommend you try your existing connection but with a cable instead of wifi.\n\nSince wifi runs on a shared frequency, it is prone to interference from other devices and networks on the same channel.  This could be from other wireless devices in your house, or even other wifi networks nearby.  Because of this, I'd strongly suggest you do a bit of testing to rule it out as the cause, before moving on to investigating other ISPs.\n\nYou can also check out the below links for some more things to test with:\n\n* [Troubleshooting Connection Issues](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues) - Riot Support\n* [Logs of Lag](http://logsoflag.com/) - Put game logs into this from games where you've had the problems described, and it will show you a graph of ping / packet loss for the whole game.\n* [Run a trace route](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752674-Network-System-and-League-of-Legends-Logs#wq2) between you and the OCE servers.  This will help show the network path from your computer, through any ISPs, to the League server.\n\nLet me know how you go!\n\nCheers\nMindstar","replies":[]},{"poster":"SephirothSG","date":"2016-01-17T07:00:36.568+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey there,\n\nI'm currently with Telstra and am experiencing no connection problems with League of Legends.\n\nI suspect something else is occurring here, are you able to test with a wired connection to ensure it isnt your wireless connection causing you issues?","replies":[]}]}
