Lee Sin for learning that landing your skillshot is really important and udyr so you choose your skills wisely on given situations.\nFor Adc I would recommend Vayne since Vayne relies on positioning for her Condem (E) and you will really learn how crucial positioning is in fights.\nFor Top I would recommend Gnar. Gnar is basically kiting your enemy till you reach Mega Gnar. I say learn Gnar for top since you would have to adapt to 2 different playstyles and again positioning for Mega Gnar's ult. Adapting to 2 different playstyles is in my opinion really good.\n\nThese champions are in my opinion not that easy to play but if you are looking to improve, I say start from these champions.\n\nP.s\nI might be a little bias for Mid since I am a Zed main but if you are looking to improve map awareness then go with twisted fate.\n\n\nEdit 1:\nI forgot about shen!!!!\nShen is good for top and developing awareness since you really have to look at the fights that are going on at other lanes and also at the same time watch yourself from getting cced to cancel your ult.","replies":[]},{"poster":"The Spawn Man","date":"2016-01-03T22:16:43.625+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I started off playing Ryze (before he was reworked) and played him for probably a hundred games. The problem is you get bored, and don't really progress. You need to play different roles to learn how to play the actual game better, then in turn use that knowledge to better your knowledge of individual champions.\n\nFirst piece of advice, play ARAM. It's a fun game mode, but best of all, it makes you try new, random champs. I remember playing a few champs there I never thought I'd play and going \"Wow! This guy is so cool/fun!\". That was Cho' Gath, that was Fizz, that was Ammumu. I now have 50K mastery in Cho, regulary carry with him, and play Fizz and Ammumu a lot and carry with them too. It's a fun, quick, and easy way to try out new champion mechanics.\n\nSecond piece of advice, go through the list of champions. Pick out a full list of every champion you think looks cool, that you've played with and wanted to try, or just for some reason are drawn to. For my I had a list of about 12 champions I reallllly wanted to play. Go through the list. Try them out if they're free to play. Research them online, and see what their builds are. What role they play. At the end of a month, I'd picked up a few and now main them, crossed out a couple because I really didn't like their mechanics (Tryndamere was one of them - I thought he was OP, but I could just never figure out how to play him), and added a few more. It's important to go through and see what appeals to you, and no one else, because it's fine winning with a champ, but if you don't enjoy it, there's not much point.\n\nNext, you need to specialise from that list at least one or two champions from that list for each role. So two top, two mid, two jungle, two supports (admittedly, I only really play one ADC because I don't really like the role and the pressure it brings to carry). And for each of those, make sure the role has two different champions types. For example, a tanky jungler, and an assassin jungler. As you learn to play more, you'll learn that all teams need a certain type of champion on them to be consistently successful. CC champs, tanks, initiators, damage dealers, AP/AD, utility etc. Having loads of options for each game means you can learn the different roles, and the roles within those roles.\n\nPersonally, I like champs that you can adapt. Champions like Singed or Urgot can really only be built one, at a stretch two, ways. I think champions that can be built in many different ways are far superior, and teach you how to play far more, as item builds are half the game. For example, AD Shaco, or maybe AP Shaco. Sion built full tank, or maybe an AD/Lifesteal Sion? Those sorts of champions are what I'd recommend aiming to get.\n\nYou can take one champion, and use it in so many roles and learn so much. For example Shaco. High skill cap, but can be easily played. I've seen him top, mid, jungle, even support as AP. You can build him tanky, crit, ap, ad, assassin, utility‚Ä¶ with a versatile champ like him, you can learn roles, lanes, build types, the own champion mechanics, and much more. This can branch off; you might enjoy playing tankier champs, or the support role, or enjoy a certain style of play, and find more champs like that. That's what I'd recommend getting.\n\nSo it's up to you what appeals, but in terms of champions that fill that sort of versatile role, here would be my picks (from those I've played): Bard, Chogath, Ekko, Ezreal, Fizz, Gangplank, Kayle, Lee Sin, Lulu, Lux, Malphite, Morgana, Nasus, Shaco, Sion, Sona, Thresh, Warwick, Zac.","replies":[{"poster":"Amaryliss","date":"2016-01-04T01:25:37.692+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=The Spawn Man,realm=OCE,application-id=FjGAIbRv,discussion-id=TBEUzpIX,comment-id=0008,timestamp=2016-01-03T22:16:43.625+0000)\n>\n> I started off playing Ryze (before he was reworked) and played him for probably a hundred games.

I didn't go on and buy any of the champs I played in ARAM tho mainly because non of them seemed a quarter as fun as Ahri/Lux...In fact I think I'd still be playing aram exclusively to this day if it weren't for the bots and the queue time. Queuing for over 10 mins(VERY common) just to end up in a game of bots(their igns have such an obvious pattern, such as ending in z) :( Sure, free wins are nice, but it just takes away the fun...I love a good challenge:D\n\nYou make Shaco sound really awesome. I love versatile champs too since I like experimenting with different builds and playstyles!:D Also I'm definitely planning on learning all roles(preferably 3 champs per role?) before ranked so I can proudly fill instead of being one of those ppl who can only play 1/2 roles(which is what I am right now). Also, my friend recommended Amumu for jungle, so I'm probably gonna learn him after Warwick:D\n\nThx so much for the advice!!!:)","replies":[{"poster":"The Spawn Man","date":"2016-01-05T07:33:14.621+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"No problem.\n\nSo what draws you to Ahri and Lux?

Maybe that can help me pin point areas of other champions you might like?\n\nAh, good question! Well, I was just surfing through the store(mostly reading the champs section), and I took one look at Ahri's kit and just thought, hey she seems like an awesome champ! It was mostly her ult, being able to dash around 3 times sounded really awesome coz at that level I was getting caught out of position all the time. My friends also recommended her and I got so excited that I refund sona(sorry sona!!!:( ) just to buy her asap:P She was my first mid champ and I certaining don't regret purchasing her. So basically I love ahri's mobility and the way she can catch 1 person with charm and they're pretty much dead:D\n\nAs for Lux...that was back to at level8 in coop vs ai when I played soraka bot so I had to go against the Ashe and Lux lane tonnes of times and I died A LOT, 1 successful light binding and I'm dead:( Then I came across a few rage posts on the old forums about Lux's range(which sounded awesome as a beginner since I can attack without being in danger) and her burst(I think I mostly like champs that have a way to kill the opponent b4 they can react, such as ahri's charm which renders then useless). Since she was so annoying as a bot, I wondered what she would be like mastered by a player, so I decided to buy her and try her out. It was confusing at first(all skillshots) but now I owe Lux a great deal in getting much much better and landng skillshots and avoiding them:D Plus she's slowly teaching me to play with an unlocked camera...can't do it yet but I can see how it would help so I'm gonna try xD \n\nI'm pretty sure that I'd love Morgana too since cc=dead me and her shield would prevent that, which means hopefully a lot less dying!:) Also the other parts of her kit are pretty similar to Lux's so she'll definitely be fun:D","replies":[{"poster":"The Spawn Man","date":"2016-01-06T05:31:52.125+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"So it looks like you like champs which allow you mobility/escapes, some cc and potential to shut down opponents as you 1v1 them?\n\nI would definitely recommend the following:\n\nBard - Excellent mobility and his E is great for escapes and luring to traps.
