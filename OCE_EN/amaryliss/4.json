Duh of course I remember you:P You're getting better!:D\n\nEDIT: Ohhh if you're talking about the other account...that was just when I went to my friends house basically every single week(parents busy...-_-) and he played games on his computer every time I went there(mostly LoL). It was kinda a 'shared account', but considering I only played like, 4 coop vs ai games on that acc not rlly:P...that's the short story. If i had to expand on any bits it would probably turn into a novel xD","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"JasonWazza","date":"2016-01-09T08:24:03.766+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":4,"body":"What server are you playing on?\n\nCause it sure as hell ain't OCE.","replies":[{"poster":"Amaryliss","date":"2016-01-09T08:25:01.485+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":2,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=JasonWazza,realm=OCE,application-id=Ntey9fRZ,discussion-id=xZKZmeq3,comment-id=0000,timestamp=2016-01-09T08:24:03.766+0000)\n>\n> What server are you playing on?\n> \n> Cause it sure as hell ain't OCE.\n\nWell it is OCE xD Haven't hit ranked yet tho...so idk:P","replies":[{"poster":"JasonWazza","date":"2016-01-09T08:27:38.796+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":2,"body":"No it's just i don't think i have had a nice smurfing game on any of my smurf accounts (hence why i don't have a second ranked account)\n\nunless it's just the specific MMR all my accounts get put in i just don't understand.","replies":[]}]}]}]}
