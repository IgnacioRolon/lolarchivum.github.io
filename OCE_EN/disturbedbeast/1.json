I experienced the same thing you did, where I leveled up that night, post game stats failed, then I got the level up capsule message on the client frontpage. Then when I played again the following day the same capsule message appeared.\nWe looked into server stats on the night of the issue and couldn't find anything wrong, so we just monitored to see if the issue continued. Everything seems to be working as intended now.","replies":[]},{"poster":"ClickClack472","date":"2018-06-03T09:03:02.871+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Happened to me as well","replies":[]},{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2018-06-02T09:03:59.882+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I've seen it happen every now and again, but usually it's because I've closed my client after getting out of game and before the animation has been able to play. Since the animation can only trigger after playing a game, the result is you see the animation after your next game. \n\nIf the animation failed to play for any reason you will have the same result. I think if your post game stats don't load and you have to skip waiting for stats it also happens then.","replies":[]}]}
