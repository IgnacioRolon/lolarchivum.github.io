Even if buying them was as a &quot;per champion&quot; basis (eg Brand themed HUD when playing Brand) I think it might be fun. I wouldn&#039;t expect there to be too many to choose from, let alone cheap, but even just a &quot;chroma&quot; for our regular HUD might be pretty sick imo. \r\n\r\nNote: It wouldn&#039;t even be an issue if they were banned from certain game modes like ranked, anything would be cool.","replies":[]}
