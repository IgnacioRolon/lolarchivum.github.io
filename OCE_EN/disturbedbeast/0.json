I&#039;m actually so mad I would literally uninstall Windows 10 **(NO JOKE)** but my CPU only works with Windows 10, it said so on the box the CPU came in and it&#039;s also noted in the instruction manual.\r\n\r\nApologies for the cuss words, but I&#039;m actually so mad I&#039;m surprised I haven&#039;t thrown this $4k PC out the flippin window already. \r\n\r\nI will do ANYTHING to stop this, even registry edits.
