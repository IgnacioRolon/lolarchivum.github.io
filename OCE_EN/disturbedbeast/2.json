I for one, would just like to say that I really appreciate that the Riot team aren&#039;t afraid to make big steps like this in order to progress with LoL&#039;s ongoing evolution. Whilst the runes are a tad confusing to dive into (compared to what we&#039;ve been used to for years), I really see some fun potential with them down the line and I think people are over-reacting a bit. The old system was stale, and nothing but a &quot;copy paste&quot; (admit it, most of us unranked people didn&#039;t bother to customise our Runes and Masteries to personal taste but rather mimic the pros setup).\r\n\r\nI also think the extra champion shards we get now will hopefully give us a wider variety of champions played other than strictly the meta, as a support main it&#039;s tiring to play only with Tristana/Jinx players all day. (To be fair though, I&#039;m also to blame playing only Raka/Nami/Sona)\r\n\r\nAnyway just wanted to say a big thanks to the Rioters on the boards for putting up with this community, and not caving in to player demands all the time (especially to the players that demand extra rights like un-banning accounts for having paid $$$ for skins, and the players that love to whinge on the boards)\r\n\r\nAlso a &quot;cheers&quot; to the players who are being a good sport about the changes, a game is only as fun as us players make it for ourselves :)\r\nGLHF on the Rift {{sticker:slayer-jinx-wink}}","replies":[{"poster":"PurpIe","date":"2017-11-09T07:12:44.062+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I miss earning IP after games. I hope they bring it back , feels weird since lets say you wanna buy something in the shop and cant afford it , you would have to wait until you level up to hopefully afford the item .

Thats actually pretty good considering the old IP system I wouldnt be able to afford a 6.3K champ that soon .","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Fitzky","date":"2017-11-09T03:21:54.180+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"The rune system is fine but the amount of BE we earn is actually a joke, there is nothing wrong with just giving us BE after every game like it was for the last 8 YEARS.","replies":[{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2017-11-09T03:43:25.770+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"https://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/developer-corner/Jh3Mtzu6-board-post-title-blue-essence-earn-rates-learning-the-numbers-with-carl-and-henrietta","replies":[{"poster":"Fitzky","date":"2017-11-09T05:40:32.055+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Like the top comment of that post says, we get a little bit more than before but over a VERY long period of time.
