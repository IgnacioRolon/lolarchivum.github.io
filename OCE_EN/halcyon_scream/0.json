I encounter far to many toxic players in the OCE community.\n\nI am generally tolerant of people tilting and having a bad game, but when I and my team endure such abuse I&#039;m compelled to report people for exhibiting toxic behavior, following Riots own guidelines.\n\nYet I am positive the reporting system or those behind do not administer severe enough punishments, and possess several loopholes. \n\nI believe w/o video evidence or a mass report failing to support your team, being silent in coms or being negative/grieving in chat are not nearly often punished.\n\nBelow is an example of someone who very lightly exhibited toxic behavior, but then unleashed a torrent of verbal abuse in the post game chat.\n\nI can only assume it is so frequent and the system is so flawed that this behavior is basically left unpunished and almost expected once in every few games.\n\nThis is my one and only grievance with Riot, that they not take punishing these people seriously or often enough.\n\nI will not tolerate this behavior, whether directed at me or the people i play with. Riot has shown great compassion and empathy with its players but I&#039;m tiring of it&#039;s failure of properly administering justice.\n\nHalcyon Scream joined the room.\n[SUMMONER 1] joined the room.\n[SUMMONER 2] joined the room.\n[SUMMONER 3] joined the room.\n[SUMMONER 4] joined the room.\n[SUMMONER 5] joined the room.\n[SUMMONER 6] joined the room.\n[SUMMONER 7] joined the room.\n[SUMMONER 8] joined the room.\n[SUMMONER 8] left the room.\n[SUMMONER 2]  left the room.\n[SUMMONER 9] : [Champ 1] and [Champ 2] MVP\n[SUMMONER 3] left the room.\n[SUMMONER 9] : waste of fucken time\n[SUMMONER 4] : your talking like u were good?\n[SUMMONER 5] left the room.\n[SUMMONER 6] left the room.\n[SUMMONER 9] : ty for promo loss\n[SUMMONER 9] : u were ****** [Champ 3]\n[SUMMONER 9] : UR LUCKY\n[SUMMONER 9] : u had a trash bot lane\n[SUMMONER 9] : l wa sgetting fed\nHalcyon Scream: lol\n[SUMMONER 9] : ur fkn lucky\n[SUMMONER 1] left the room.\n[SUMMONER 9] : n ur ******\nHalcyon Scream: report this guy spls\n[SUMMONER 9] : u gnas lose all ur games u fkn ****** nerd\n[SUMMONER 9] : report\nHalcyon Scream: Verbal abuse and greifing in game\n[SUMMONER 9] : l said nothin in game\n[SUMMONER 9] : report me u %%% bitchh nerd\n[SUMMONER 9] : [Champ 4]\nHalcyon Scream: yes you did\n[SUMMONER 9] : LOL\nHalcyon Scream: I will\n[SUMMONER 9] : didnt even say anything bad in game\n[SUMMONER 4] : how am i a nerd?\n[SUMMONER 9] : mao admitted toi greifing\nHalcyon Scream: yes you did\n[SUMMONER 9] : in game u dumb fucklin nerd dog\n[SUMMONER 7] left the room.\n[SUMMONER 9] : l was jus playing\nHalcyon Scream: keep talking\n[SUMMONER 9] : pretentious nerd biitch victim [Champ 4]\n[SUMMONER 9] : go **** urself\nHalcyon Scream: all going in the email\n[SUMMONER 9] : do it\nHalcyon Scream: i will\n[SUMMONER 9] : nerd\n[SUMMONER 9] : go cry to momma\n[SUMMONER 4] : again how am i a nerd?\n[SUMMONER 9] : what happene din game?\n[SUMMONER 9] : l said nothing no swearing at you\n[SUMMONER 9] : or anything\n[SUMMONER 9] : LOL\n[SUMMONER 9] : you&#039;re pathetic\nHalcyon Scream: I didnt say you did\n[SUMMONER 9] : [Champ 1] admitted to greifing\n[SUMMONER 9] : u moron\n[SUMMONER 9] : u dont even remembe rwho u wwere talking to in game\n[SUMMONER 9] : you&#039;re a fuckin idiot\nHalcyon Scream: But you&#039;re giving Riot plenty of reasons to ban you\n[SUMMONER 9] : go write an email to riot about what someone said to u after game\n[SUMMONER 9] : cocksucking victim\n[SUMMONER 9]  left the room.\n[SUMMONER 4] : im feeling some rage from [Champ 5]\nHalcyon Scream: It&#039;s noit rage\n[SUMMONER 4] left the room.\nHalcyon Scream: It&#039;s lashing out becasue he&#039;s really insecure","replies":[{"poster":"Rocaset","date":"2017-03-06T01:27:20.666+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The thing I've learned in the passed few years of playing league in OCE, is that nobody cares about anyone else but themselves and you shoud expect to get shat on, because Riot won't do anything but put you in lowpri.","replies":[]}]}
