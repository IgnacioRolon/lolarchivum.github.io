I join a game and for no reason why my computer doesn&#039;t go into the game for a short period in every 10 or so games. Then a pop up 5 minutes later will say you have been disconnected please reconnect.\r\nAs this happens and i am AFK for a short period i have leaver buster every few games.\r\nIt is extremely frustrating.\r\nEven after playing maybe 30-40 games it happens again and i have to wait another 100 minutes 5*20,. and 1/4 of the time i have to wait the 20 minutes twice\r\n\r\nThere needs to be some middle ground.","replies":[{"poster":"DiamondAries","date":"2015-06-11T05:08:11.066+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I have actually never received LeaverBuster for crashing and disconnections. The only problem I've had with it is that sometimes life just makes you need to leave a game, and I sometimes get a low priority queue even if the last time I left was two weeks ago. Understandable, but sort of annoying.
