Here are a few examples! \n\nThe same - Planet destruction sounds\n\nEarth - a splash noise and let's out a splash upon hitting a target leaving a blue trail as the earth is more water.\n\nPluto - has a more light blue trail that resembles Ice making a icicle sound like shattering upon hitting a target.\n\nMercary - the sound of rock  with a Gray trail upon hitting a target it makes rock effects.\n\nSaturn -  more of a distant rock or rocks sound with asteroid particles flying off the target from the rings. It has a yellow red trail.\n\nHe's E - makes him leave a trail of stars behind her in a long pattern behind him in a trail.\n\nTo be honest I'm not sure how planets haven't already been done for him. I mean he likes stars and fire but still surely this crossed your mind. \n\nThe next idea!\n\nSnow Day Aurelion Sol (Lowest hanging Fruit)\n\nCmon, make him out of snow like just colour change him to white with snow day hat to make him like a ice wisp or spirit or keep him blue and just add a hat! (I know it's once a year but still) \n\nQ - Snowball in the middle with a snow storm around it!\n\nW - Flying snowballs!\n\nE - SINGED SNOW TRAIL!\n\nAND that's all the ideas!","replies":[{"poster":"Garen Player","date":"2019-10-03T14:29:22.449+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Not a bad idea, send it to Riot through Suggestions section in the support page, maybe they'll have a look at it.","replies":[]}]}
