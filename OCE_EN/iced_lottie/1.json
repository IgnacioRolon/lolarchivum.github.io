So you get the option of knowing you&#039;re going into a game that you&#039;re going to lose or dodging and facing penalties yourself. I know there&#039;s not really a great system to avoid this, but it happens so freaking often and it&#039;s so bullshit when it does. You can&#039;t even report pre-game trolls unless you tough it out and lose the full lp anyway. It&#039;s a complete lose/lose situation for everyone but the troll.","replies":[{"poster":"KawtYouNow","date":"2016-09-16T01:39:39.374+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I know exactly what you mean, this has happened to me so many times and i'm never sure if i wana dodge and take the penalty myself or tough it out. #relatable","replies":[]}]}
