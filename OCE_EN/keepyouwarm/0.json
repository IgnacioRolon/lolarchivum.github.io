If someone is feeding intentionally in multiple games then they will face temporary account suspensions and possible bans if they show no signs of reform.\n> \n> LeaverBuster\n> \n> I keep getting leavers in my game. What happens to them?\n> \n> The first time a player leaves a game, they’ll see a pop-up explaining that leaving is not okay and then have to manually agree to not leave future games. If they continue to repeatedly ruin other players’ experiences, they’ll enter lower-priority matchmaking for a number of games. While in low priority queue, players will experience queue times that are 5, 10, even 20 minutes longer than a player who hasn't left games.\n> \n> Players will know how many games they have in lower-priority, and if they join a premade group, that group will be notified they are playing with a chronic AFK/leaver and they’ll face the same lower-priority time penalty.\n> \n> While we hope it doesn’t ever happen, if a player fails to stop AFKing or leaving while in lower-priority matchmaking, continued offenses will result in bans.\n> \n> You can read more about LeaverBuster in Lyte’s post: http://oce.leagueoflegends.com/en/news/game-updates/player-behavior/updates-leaverbuster\n\nAs for getting out of bronze, I believe you can do it!

But the amount of trolls, AFK's or non-connects, intentional feeders, toxic immature keyboard warriors I've run into in the past month that I've been back have reminded me why I left in the first place.\n\nI mean you only have to read through a couple of the comments in THIS THREAD to see the typical anti-social attitude that Riot is apparently trying to counteract. Yes there's a report button, but seriously, do the forum moderators actually actively read through these things and take action against the usual forum trolls with the \"umadbro\" \"lol noob\" comments?\n\nI'm guessing they don't since there are plenty of posts that are more than a fortnight old with just that, you're not really discouraging that sort of behaviour nor do you promote a constructive forum environment when you let so many things slide. I realise it's the internet and educating people on how to behave like a functional member of society is ultimately a Sisyphean task, but maybe a harsher approach should be taken to both the in-game problem players and forum trolls alike.","replies":[{"poster":"JasonWazza","date":"2015-04-27T12:52:29.945+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"If a post gets reported it gets checked, otherwise they don't care.\n\nI have used the word \"asshole\" several times on these boards, but because one guy (who was being an asshole mind you) reported me (in 3 separate posts), i managed to get a 1 day ban.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Struggle","date":"2015-04-27T00:38:00.017+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"You can get out of bronze,  there will be a few trolls and afks but I don't think that there is ever enough to use it as the reason to justify why you can't get out of bronze","replies":[]},{"poster":"Slim Chaedi","date":"2015-04-27T00:30:29.694+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I had a duo top towerdiving me as Riven because they argued who'd be top.

I used to be stuck in b5 and for my loss I always blamed the team for their mistakes when it was my mistakes when you realise what you did you wrong and improve on them you will climb right now I have climbed to b3 and right now in promos and my win rate is way higher than before.
