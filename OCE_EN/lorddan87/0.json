I'm not a wrenchmen, but I'd recommend running a client repair or reinstalling League entirely assuming that League is the source of the problem.  If it's your PC itself that's the problem then you'll need to look into what's causing it on your end.\n\nAs for the 20 minute penalty being too harsh, think of it this way: Your specific issue of course makes a remake possible, so it's not quite so bad, but assume the team can't remake, you've ruined 160 minutes~ of experiences (40 minutes average game time x 4 teammates) and that isn't even accounting for the enemy team. Remake of course exists to mitigate the frustration, but I've had the experience of two queue dodges then two remakes then two queue dodges in a row before I actually got into game and I tell you that wasted time and effort really adds up.\n\nIt isn't just you that's hurt by your dcs, and ultimately Riot has to look out for the 9 other people that did nothing wrong over the 1 person who is having computer troubles.\n\nThe fact that you are on 20 minutes queues means this must happen pretty often, and it's your responsibility to ensure that you can get into (and stay in) a game for the duration, and from the sounds of it you haven't done much to accomplish that. Obviously every one will have occasional issues, but most people never see Leaver Buster queues because it doesn't punish for the every now and again.","replies":[]}]}
