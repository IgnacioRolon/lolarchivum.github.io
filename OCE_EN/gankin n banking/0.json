Game 2 is pretty self explanatory, not sure why im reported there. Game 3 their team was flaming someone who did badly so i was defending him. Game 1 i was being called boosted by my duo partner and was defending myself. Yes I did lash out at ez and ahri and once at grag but to me that is the only game that I would have reported myself for.","replies":[{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2016-04-04T08:42:41.726+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Sorry it took so long to get back to you, I thought I had responded to your first post but clearly I forgot so sorry about that. Fair warning, this is going to be long.\n\nI'll try and address this all in order, first thing you mentioned was this:\n> i think the fact that it is a \"player triggered\" review that caused my ban just makes me feel like something can be done to help me be unbanned possibly. \n\nAll this means is that you were banned as a result of being reported, a ban will not be removed unless it is made in error, your ban was not and thus will not be revoked. \n\nHowever, I can still give you some perspective on why you were punished from these chat logs so that you can learn from them if you choose to make a new account.\n\nNow you may have been making a conscious effort but it seems it has been too little too late unfortunately. The behaviour you demonstrated in the past may have been more severe, but the behaviour shown in these chat logs is still deemed unacceptable (I'll get to specifics in a moment). \n\n___\n\nA simplistic way of describing the system would be to have a few tiers of severity. You have 0 being false reports (i.e the person reported hasn't done anything wrong), 1 being chat logs that will be flagged but won't trigger a punishment on their own, 3 being logs that will trigger a punishment, and 4 being logs that will escalate a punishment (i.e skip the two chat restrictions and go straight to 14 day ban or just skipping a tier, this is usually reserved for things like extreme hate speech).\n\nThis isn't exactly how the punishment system works, but it's the easiest way I can explain it and fits well enough with your case. So onto your actual logs.\n\n___\n\n**Game 1:**\n> Gankin n Banking: what are you doing grag you retard\n\nImmediately this sets a negative precedent for the game. That one line changes your teams view of you from an ordinary player to a negative one. What this means is that they will assume a negative spin on anything further you say. You could be giving honest advice, \n\n> Gankin n Banking: don't farm with e\n\nbut they will hear it as criticism because you have demonstrated that negativity. It'd take a lot of positivity (not just neutrality) to get them to give you the benefit of the doubt after that.\n\nIf that was all you'd said, you would have been fine, but you continued in this manner. Negativity sticks. You generally have to demonstrate a lot of positivity to earn honours, but it's the opposite for negativity. You've set the mood and your team's view of you and any further negativity just makes things so much worse for you and for them.\n\n> Gankin n Banking: you fucking spastic\nGankin n Banking: walks into my lane throws r and just walks away\nGankin n Banking: good baits from retarded players\n\nThis is actually really bad. It reeks of undeserved hate and toxicity, and sounds like it was after someone made a failed gank. More than likely, they already know what they did wrong, or what they could have done better, they may already be hitting themselves for making a dumb mistake. You spouting hate at them like this doesn't just set a negative tone, it becomes a personal attack. Anything you say to that player now they will likely take as directed at them, and you have effectively ruined their experience.\n\nSo I want you to ask yourself, what does saying that actually accomplish? If anything it's going to make that player perform worse. It not only distracts you from the game but it makes everything harder for them as well.\n\nIf you can just remember, to put yourself on the other side of things like this, then I think you'll do a lot better. If you had just made a dumb mistake, how would you feel if someone said that to you?\n\nAfter that you continually target and attack who I assume is your jungler and it's not ok.\n\n> Gankin n Banking: report thresh no follow up\n\nWhy? This is a tactical disagreement. Clearly the Thresh didn't trust in the engage and didn't want to go in. You need to be playing WITH your team, not around them. If the Thresh doesn't engage then why did you continue to fight? Once you saw he backed off you should have as well. Of course I don't know what happened here exactly, but that's what it sounds like from your log. Tactical disagreements are not reportable.\n\n> Gankin n Banking: how do oyu not\nGankin n Banking: 'have an hourglass\n\nAgain, tactical disagreement. Maybe they know they are bad at remembering actives, and thus would benefit more from survivability elsewhere, or maybe they wanted other specific items? Maybe the Thresh was successfully peeling for them and they felt they would be better off with more damage?\n\n**As a whole, this game was VERY negative on your part. Game 1 is more than a little report worthy and you barely let up the whole game. I'd consider this a very solid 3 on that scale I gave you way back up there, maybe even bordering on 4 given the relentlessness.**\n\n___\n\n**Game 2**\n\n> Gankin n Banking: shyv might be scripting smite\nGankin n Banking: or just retarded\nGankin n Banking: 1 or the other\n\n**Not much to say here, that ^ is what you will have been flagged for. I'd say this game was a 2, it was flagged as negative but not nearly enough to punish you for. That said, I'd say after what I can see in Game 1 that you were lucky to not be perma-banned after just that game.**\n\n___\n\n**Game 3**\n\n> Gankin n Banking: think i'll kill your pussy ass\nGankin n Banking: make him afk\nGankin n Banking: ur mad\nGankin n Banking: report urgot\nGankin n Banking: feederinop\n\n**This is another short one so I'll be brief. I'd consider this a solid 3 provided a history of negativity (which you have). You are inciting negativity and frustration which is NEVER ok. Not to mention that feeding is not repotable/punishable, only INTENTIONALLY feeding is. From the way you speak I highly doubt it is intentionally, and you saying to report him is nothing but a detriment.\n**\n___\n\nIf nothing else, just think, how do you benefit from this behaviour? Is telling someone they're stupid going to suddenly make them wise up to their mistakes and play perfectly? No it isn't, it's going to distract them, drain any positivity from the game for them and make them play worse.\n\nSo where does this leave you? The short of it is that you aren't going to get your account back. You are free to make a new account, but be aware that you will be detected/punished much faster if you do not reform your behaviour.\n\nIf you can't stand chat, either /mute all at the start of every game, and/or move your chat off screen. \n\nId like you to take a long hard look at this statistic:\n> You are among 0.006% of League players egregiously negative enough to be permanently banned.\n\nand really consider what that means, and what it says about your behaviour. If you make a new account, then use it as an opportunity to prove you are making a conscious effort, because **what the system sees right now is that you are more negative than 99.994% of players.**","replies":[{"poster":"Gankin n Banking","date":"2016-04-05T01:13:52.174+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hi, just some context on that thresh, he's one of my best friends IRL, the whole game the team was flaming me about him boosting me because I had a poor early game and he was playing out of his mind.

There's some pretty harsh stuff in there.
