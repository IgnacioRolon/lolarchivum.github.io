I was very recently banned for 2 weeks as a result of extreme toxicity. I admit it was awful some of the things i was saying and i deserved it 100% but I have recently been perm banned for what i would think an unfair reason. Here are my chat logs.\r\nOn top of this i think the fact that it is a &quot;player triggered&quot; review that caused my ban just makes me feel like something can be done to help me be unbanned possibly. Here are my chat logs and exact wording on my ban message:\r\n\r\nBecause a player-triggered review found your in-game comms extremely inflammatory and offensive, your account&#039;s been permanently suspended.

Game 2 is pretty self explanatory, not sure why im reported there. Game 3 their team was flaming someone who did badly so i was defending him. Game 1 i was being called boosted by my duo partner and was defending myself. Yes I did lash out at ez and ahri and once at grag but to me that is the only game that I would have reported myself for.","replies":[]}
