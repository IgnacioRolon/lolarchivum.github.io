He was going in middile of waves and literally 1v2'ing them, giving them 1st blood at 2 min, not to mention the fact that he was also extremely toxic and continued to die every minute or so, while also blaming me for not \"attacking\" When leona and thresh went straight for me & bursted me in 5 sec lol. in the next 10 min I set up a few kills (6) for malphite to steal and not peel me at all while leona & thresh destroying me, then later blaming me for not attacking xD.\r\nskip 20 min, all towers till inhib turrets r gone score is like 10 vs 40, ezreal wukong and j4 slowly getting kills and I making a small comeback by finally getting farm and lots of assists / few kills. both our inhibs die, we are on a huge downhill but we started winning some fights. The enemy team decides to baron, and being the bronze/silver cocky nubs everyone is, they threw it and got aced + we got baron while I was defending base from winions. then the 4 got 4 turrets and inhib on top. this reaching around 40 min or so. then we won the next 3 teamfights and ended game.\r\nand this got me to silver yey\r\n\r\nTL;DR\r\nDon't surrender, you never know what will happen.","replies":[{"poster":"DiamondAries","date":"2015-02-21T10:07:44.556+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I think Riot should REMOVE SURRENDER COMPLETELY! All it is is a way for noobs and toxic players to try and end the game faster. There is no point in surrendering. If you put the effort into trying to win a game, you need to apply that effort throughout the entire game. \n\nBut I'm not even lvl30, so what do I know? Enough to say that a team can win at any moment in the game. You see the enemy going for baron 40 kills ahead? Go and get it to have a game changer. All it takes is one good teamfight for a game to go the complete opposite direction. So many games I've played where we were around 15-20k gold behind, and we aced their team, pushed a lane and won.\n\nIf not removing surrender completely, then at least disable it for at least the first 30-45 mins. So much can happen in a small amount of time, especially in league.\n\nand remember, Good luck and have fun guys :D","replies":[{"poster":"soullessrain","date":"2015-02-21T12:24:09.447+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"they should remove it but they won't","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Best Viktor AU","date":"2015-02-20T11:05:51.855+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You just had a better teamfight.","replies":[{"poster":"TotoDudmas","date":"2015-02-20T20:23:14.236+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The thing is thatt we did no damage and they could've ended but they threw","replies":[{"poster":"Best Viktor AU","date":"2015-02-21T05:35:11.085+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"If you did no damage it would've been impossible to kill them.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Homura Akemi","date":"2015-02-21T01:43:11.686+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"i won a game with ap jax mid against ori teemo top i was jarvan support with smite. it was the most autistic bronze game I've played but it was so good. these games remind me why bronze is heaven","replies":[]},{"poster":"Blackavar","date":"2015-02-21T01:27:19.171+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"i did a game when i was like level 15 we were 50 kills down and we had 50 hp on nexus left but then i just went in with kats ult got na ace ( not a penta, there were only 3 alive) then we pushed and just won.","replies":[]},{"poster":"BarryButcher","date":"2015-02-20T06:04:11.473+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I wouldn't say never.

I was Jax against a Lee Sin top, I had won my lane but my kd was negative because everyone else on the enemy team was fed.\nAnyway at one point when they were fighting near our inhibitor trying to take it I was split pushing and took their inhibitor. Later on our Garen (I think he was support) tried splitpushing but got caught out by 3 of the enemies, our Udyr went to help him which resulted in the enemy team going on a wild goose chase around their jungle, meanwhile the wave up top had 2 super minions and was quickly making it's way to the enemy base. I think Leblanc was pressuring mid and I can't remember where the fifth person was.\nI then teleported to the wave and quickly started demolishing towers. The 3 enemies were unable to respond immediately because they were occupied with Garen and Udyr, I don't know what the others on their team were doing, they may have also been preoccupied but it meant that I took out both nexus turrets before they came to respond. Then the 3 that had finished their chase showed up, Braum and Lee Sin ulted me but I was able to leap strike back to the nexus and finish it with a tiny amount of health left. \nWe had been behind in gold for most of that game.","replies":[{"poster":"TotoDudmas","date":"2015-02-20T20:23:39.353+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Nice","replies":[]}]}]}
