People don't want to put in that much effort, therefore they surrender and try for an easier game.\n\nI don't recommend lower Elos to surrender as soon as something goes wrong, they should take the time and learn how to come back. In higher Elo it's a lot (I mean A LOT) harder to come back into a game, though still possible. If I've offended anyone by separating higher and lower Elos I apologise.","replies":[{"poster":"Charon","date":"2015-04-02T10:25:39.095+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"No you are quite right, I still remember in Preseason that no matter how many games I played half of them seemed to go to 50+ minutes, and quite often we would win even though we were behind early game.
