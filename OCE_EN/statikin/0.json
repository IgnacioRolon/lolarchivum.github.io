I acknowledge its meant to carry over from previous tournaments but its no secret that most players didn't even play in the last one since it crashed completely.","replies":[{"poster":"Project Xayah","date":"2018-10-14T06:02:51.702+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'd imagine that Riot will be holding another \"beta\" launch for Clash once they've properly determined what went wrong last time and have fixed the system so the crash doesn't happen again. At the moment, it's all just about finding problems and making sure everything is working smoothly.\n\nEDIT: Ok, so I just read through the [News announcement regarding the Clash test](https://oce.leagueoflegends.com/en/news/game-updates/features/help-us-test-clash-weekend) and it seems the plan is to change to a new reward \"theme\" going forward, meaning the Clash Beta Banner will no longer be available. It doesn't make sense, considering, but that is, unfortunately, the way it is. It *may* be possible, if unlikely, to get people together to change Riot's mind on that (could try a boards [in Miscellaneous, for example] post to bring attention to it, or some other medium [such as Reddit]).","replies":[]}]}
