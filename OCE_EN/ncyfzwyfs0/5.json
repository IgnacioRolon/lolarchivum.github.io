Also the addition of the ranked tier boundary completely took away the only appealing thing from it (which ranked team stood our for not having over solo q).\n\nAlso the amount of champions that are beyond busted at the moment makes normals unplayable as they are the only ones picked now as everyone is just playing to win.\n\nAnyone who was wanting to play ranked 5s didnt care about the queue times or the lack of variation in teams they were vsing because they were\njust playing to have fun with their team.","replies":[]}
