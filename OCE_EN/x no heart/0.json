Learning to work with teammates is a necessity for team sports, but requiring a ragtag group of players to help somebody show off an individual performance is unheard of. Solo League players are alienated, true competitors are alienated, and the passionate are alienated. For what purpose, exactly? To maintain the interest of people that lose interest in things that their friends aren&#039;t doing?\n\nLook, I get wanting to create a lasting and memorable group experience for those lucky enough to have players they get along with in every single game. Those are memories they can cherish in the future. However, there are better ways to incentivize team play than forcing it. Bonuses should be just that: bonuses.\n\nDon&#039;t do this. Just stop.","replies":[]}
