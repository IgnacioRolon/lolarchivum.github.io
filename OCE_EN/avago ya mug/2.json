Most AVs have inbuilt firewalls, so having an outdated AV (among other risks) can mean your exceptions are outdated as well.\n\nAssuming updating your AV isn't enough, your next step is to ensure you have an exception for League in your firewall. _If you're using a different firewall, find or lookup the process to add an exception through that software._\n\n___\n\nIf you're using the default Win 10 firewall, then go \"Control Panel\" > \"Windows Defender Firewall\" > \"Allow an app or feature\". \n\n_If League of Legends appears more than once, it's probably because you've been adding an exception every time League patches, this isn't a bad thing but makes it hard to tell if the current patch is being allowed, so your best bet will be to remove them all, and then re-add the exceptions._\n\nIf any of the League processes aren't check-marked, click \"Change Settings\" and do so. If they aren't listed, you'll have to add them.\n\n\"Change Settings\" > \"Allow another app...\" > Find League of Legends in the list **OR** \"Browse\" > Navigate to your League of Legends folder, usually C:/Riot Games/ League of Legends\n\nFor **LoLLauncher **(may also be listed as just League of Legends): **\"LeagueClient (.exe)\"**\n\nFor **League of Legends (TM) Client**:  \"Game\" > **\"League of Legends (.exe)\"**\n\nFor **League of Legends**: \"RADS\" > \"projects\" > \"league_client\" > \"releases\" > \"0.0.0.xxx\" (biggest number) > \"deploy\" > **\"LeagueClient (.exe)\"**\n\nThis isn't my area, I'm not certain you need to allow all 3 or just those last two, but it certainly won't do any harm.\n\n___\n\nAssuming none of that solves your drama, or your exceptions and AV were already in order, it may not be the firewall itself causing the issue. Switch to ethernet if relevant/possible, and run a client repair. If that also doesn't help or you encounter the problem again (do some testing in customs/practice mode), submit a ticket to Player Support and they ought to be able to help you further: https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/requests/new","replies":[{"poster":"Avago ya mug","date":"2019-03-22T13:16:31.301+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"OK, so this explains a sudden ending in my game for no reason? \nI mean literally just ended and said defeat! \nEven in the game replay you can see it happen, for no reason it just decides game over.\n\nNow I'm experiencing issue about streaming incompatibility, the game auto forces closed and returns me to the client home page to reconnect.\nOh yeah, I don't stream or have any stream software.\n\nI checked the exceptions, ( you were right, i was less right (ty edit) i did have a few there. \nI removed them all, restarted client and it added 2, one I had to check as was unchecked.\n\n","replies":[{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2019-03-22T13:55:28.692+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"So when you crashed the game ended?
