My stats are all there, so can all see. \r\n\r\nKnow other roles but mostly just 1-2 trick champs for them, as i feel this is minimum needed to understand other roles, game play, map awareness,  opportunities and when not to be dumb etc. I love the role as support, however synergy and team work is hard to find in solo and is not easy to bring game back from the dead as support, so forum i shall reach to you!\r\n\r\nIt matters not your rank, as long as you can play effectively in your role/s and as a team player/s (and not be dumb), with this can easily move through rank divisions (so i like to think anyway).\r\nWould prefer if anyone that adds me to play a norm game or two first, just to see if our play styles fit before i go back into ranked, as i like winning. Who knows you may hate me, hahaha but i seriously doubt it!\r\n\r\nI have Uni life on GC so cant always play, love watching the LKC (its all i ever watch) them Koreans are good even in bronze (as even in bronze they know importance of team work).\r\n\r\nSo care for a game?
