It is so hard to find anyone that can work in collaboration with a support, I think small things such as letting the wave push towards ur turret and staying there when ur supp bases to gain that solo lane exp advantage and be safe makes things more easier. Or even backing off when the sup goes to ward, that&#039;s a rare thing to see and the amount of adc that die when this happens is huge! \r\nAlso any OCE live streamers??? I&#039;ve only stumbled across 1 DeFinch, she is cool very interactive with her views, but apart fom that where are all the Pro OCE streamers? anyone plz tell me, or ill watch the NA streams.... I will !!!!!","replies":[{"poster":"Nijel","date":"2015-12-07T02:23:14.216+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"How do you not know about the Number 10,865 OCE Streamer?\n\nhttp://www.twitch.tv/nijiiyo","replies":[{"poster":"Avago ya mug","date":"2015-12-10T10:55:32.836+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"let me know when the stream is on or the youtube chnl!","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Klavinmour","date":"2015-12-06T09:28:28.507+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"How do you not know about the Number One OCE Streamer?\n\nhttp://www.twitch.tv/loserfruit","replies":[{"poster":"Project Xayah","date":"2015-12-06T09:45:25.505+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Simply not caring helps.","replies":[{"poster":"Klavinmour","date":"2015-12-06T12:12:03.058+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You don't care because she refuses to acknowledge the existence of Quinn {{sticker:slayer-jinx-wink}}","replies":[{"poster":"Project Xayah","date":"2015-12-06T20:55:05.187+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Or maybe I just don't know any streamers because I prefer to play a game than watch someone else play.\n\nHonestly, I couldn't care less that they don't acknowledge the existence of Quinn.

I had 6 wins  2 losses for pre season rank after the way the losses came about I didn't even bother playing the other 2 games. Considering a lot of s2 pro players are quitting as now LoL is a lot more about team play then anything else, too in depth on their own role when now u really need a team that functions as a single unit. Just the way the game is evolving, shame too many hot heads that have an ego in the way.","replies":[]}]}]}
