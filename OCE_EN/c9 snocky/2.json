Kind of annoying because its not like there was anyone else there and he could have left at any time so i dont really see why its punishable but whatever.\r\n\r\nIs it even possible to get back to honor 2 before rewards drop or do i really lose a whole years worth of effort because of this","replies":[{"poster":"Nejire Hado","date":"2018-10-28T08:52:41.264+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Since you weren't banned, only given a chat restriction, you can get your rewards back if you hit Honour 2 again.\n\nThe issue is first unlocking your Honour level in order to progress, and second to actually get there.\n\nHowever, this is entirely possible!!! Based on what Riot have said, you get the same amount of Honour regardless of game length. So many short games = more honour than fewer long games.\n\nSo basically... spam Intro bots (or Beginner if Intro doesn't give honour) until the end of the season. Might take 100 Intro/Beginner bot games, but this is entirely manageable.\n\nThis would be much easier if OCE had Treeline Bots, since you can finish matches in 9 minutes.\n\nHope this helps :)\n{{sticker:sg-ahri-2}}","replies":[]},{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2018-10-27T12:47:15.324+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You need to be Honour 2 to receive ranked rewards.
