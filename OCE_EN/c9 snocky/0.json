Especially because flaming is so prevalent, people often flame in response to flame which is also bannable which is even more odd","replies":[{"poster":"Periscope","date":"2018-03-22T04:06:59.586+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"So what did your chat logs say?

The people in that game were flaming as well, I was flaming, people I Q with flame and I even admit I have been more toxic than the chat logs chose to ban me.\n\nThis game slowly wears down players because the whole community is toxic","replies":[{"poster":"Ornn Bot","date":"2018-03-31T03:10:38.123+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"riot9automated system) have a snowflake approach to players behavior \"if someone is offended they deserve to be banned\" and that's as simple as it goes  that in itself is the wrong way to do things and there is nothing we can do about it","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Gloric","date":"2018-03-22T20:24:46.079+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"There's a reason system of law are not actively democratic, vocal minorities would have you hung for things like pre-marrital sex, because more relaxed and laid back opinions, though maybe the majority, don't actively report and protest against those vocal minorities.\nie. Generally snowflakes report a lot more than your average gamer.\n\nThe biggest thing lacking is actual troll bans. So many trolls and inters go unpunished. \nThere is a clear distinction between someone who plays badly or gives up, or etc.. and someone who intentionally trolls/ints. And the latter should be severely punished, but they really aren't as there's no way to automatically detect this.\nI think there's possibly some misconception within the community/devs that a lot of trolling/inting happens as a result of toxicity, when from my experience, it can be sparked by the person simply playing badly for the first few minutes, or even the slightest angst from another player;\n \"dude why did you come to lane at low health!? it was obvious you'd die if you did that\"\n\"I was just trying to help (internally; fuck this guy, i'm inting now)\"\nAnd there's absolutely nothing a automated system can detect OTHER than the person asking this person, even if a bit abrasively, why they made a stupid decision like that.\n\nUsually what happens in these situations, is these kids go completely silent and just go about inting (can't deny, most of them have to be, no emotionally stable person reacts to criticism by going silent and inting).\n\nI can't tell you how many chat restrictions i've gotten for simply being mad at a guy who ints for 15-20 minutes on purpose after a single question or mild criticism. And nothing has happened to them (I see them game after game after game, if I play at low pop times).","replies":[{"poster":"Periscope","date":"2018-03-22T21:58:20.405+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":">There's a reason system of law are not actively democratic, vocal minorities would have you hung for things like pre-marrital sex, because more relaxed and laid back opinions, though maybe the majority, don't actively report and protest against those vocal minorities.\nie.

You wanna talk about inting/trolling, then you can make your own discussion. \n\nThrough the tribunal and other sources of player feedback, we have the rules that make up the Instant Feedback System we have today that punishes negative chat, among other things. Whether or not you agree with how the rules are drawn up is up to you, but you play Riot's game, it's their rules.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"smokydarkx","date":"2018-03-21T07:56:43.636+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":2,"body":"There is a problem with toxcity bans and you're the problem.
