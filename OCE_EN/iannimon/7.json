The goal is to become as competitive as possible in amateur leagues and above in the future. Also looking to play in the coming clash tournament, fill out the link if you are interested in Clash!\r\n\r\nThe team has 3 dedicated practice nights, Monday, Wednesday and Thursday from 8pm.\r\nWe are currently interested in talking to and playing some games with anyone who is gold and above and capable of making some of those practice times.\r\n\r\nIf this sounds like you and you are interested in either the team or Clash tournament, follow the link below and answer the questions. If you are close to making the minimum cut off rank (gold) and have a good attitude it is fine for you to follow the link and answer the questions.\r\n\r\nhttps://docs.google.com/forms/d/1LnQ8MHs9jF_YlqCumF6EgrK6imLhjxWcz_mMTGMukB4\r\n\r\nYou will then hear more about the team,\r\n\r\nThanks!","replies":[]}
