This is for the OCE client too. Unsure as to whether it is the same for the other regions.\r\nUninstalling and redownloading the client has come to no avail either.\r\nMy guess is it must be something to do with the client installer, which may even be a bit out of date as well as when it is installed the version is from 15th September 2014.\r\n\r\nI hope this help describes the problem, and if any other people have had this problem but have been able o fix it, the help would be much appreciated.","replies":[{"poster":"Wuks","date":"2015-12-20T13:44:02.444+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey kenpachiUzumaki,\n\nCan you try running the lol.launcher.admin.exe file in your League of Legends folder and see if the client opens?","replies":[{"poster":"kenpachiUzumaki","date":"2015-12-22T08:39:48.089+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"woah that actually opens the client and allows it to update, sorry for the super late reply but at this stage thats fixed it! thanks man!!!","replies":[]}]}]}
