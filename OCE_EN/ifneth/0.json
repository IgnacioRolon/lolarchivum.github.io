This lack of detail leaves some things to the imagination, and I therefore have proposed some tactics below.  What do you think of them, and what tactics do you think they have?\r\n\r\n**Remain in Reserve**\r\nThe Demacian military recognizes that powerful units must be reserved for important tasks.  Therefore, the Dauntless Vanguard is doubtless kept behind regular units and sent into battle only when the Demacian general in question decides that the benefit of the Vanguard&#039;s service outweighs the cost of replacing the casualties it would suffer in battle.\r\n\r\n**Focus and Brevity**\r\nTo further reduce casualties among the Vanguard, whose well-equipped and well-trained soldiers are difficult to procure, the unit must also use its discipline to focus on its task and fight only briefly, withdrawing quickly once its objective has been achieved or deemed not worth further losses.  Furthermore, the withdrawal of a prized unit would likely draw counter-attacks, pulling Noxian units from the main fight and offering a chance for ambushes.\r\n\r\n**Deny the Enemy**\r\nAs Garen says, the best way to kill a man is to cut through the one standing next to him, and so the Dauntless Vanguard begins every battle by seeking to cut through what stands beside the army of its enemy.  Its knights find enemy scouts and seize important locations, whilst its raiders sneak behind enemy lines to destroy supply wagons, and its guards watch the Demacian army to which the Vanguard is attached, ensuring it remains hidden.\r\n\r\n**Breakthrough**\r\nWith the enemy preferably denied intelligence, supplies, and early objectives, the Dauntless Vanguard can further assist the Demacian army by breaking through weak points, either letting the army continue through them or withdrawing to force the enemy to commit precious reserves to securing that and other points against other surprise assaults from the Vanguard.\r\n\r\n**Defend by Attacking**\r\nThe Demacian army is not always on the offensive, yet the Dauntless Vanguard still can help it.  Garen can lead its disciplined and brave troops behind Demacian units facing Noxian attack and burst forth right before they meet, raking their exposed flank with the devastating might of the Vanguard while the Demacian unit seizes the initiative to press the advantage or break free and be relieved.\r\n\r\n--\r\n\r\nBy applying these tactics, the Dauntless Vangaurd would hit the enemy where it hurts, time and time again, while retaining its strength throughout and after each battle.  It would become not only the fever dream of beleagured Demacian troops but the living nightmare of entire Noxian armies: a tireless foe always one step ahead.\r\n\r\n-Ifneth","replies":[{"poster":"EzeBlood","date":"2018-01-16T10:25:45.477+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"So... basically, giant men in even bigger armour wage war with guerilla tactics?","replies":[]},{"poster":"Sibireaman","date":"2018-01-13T18:06:52.153+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"pretty cool bro","replies":[]}]}
