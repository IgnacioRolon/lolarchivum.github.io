Dealing true damage to turrets on first hit.","subforum":"Miscellaneous","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Im not sure if this is intended but i cant find a post about it anywhere, when i play a jungler using devourer I my first basic attack deals a large chunk of true damage to the lane turrets upon a gank. It happens periodically maybe once every 2 minutes but its a large bit (200-350) of damage that i cant explain from my items runes or masteries. Any thoughts?","replies":[{"poster":"Zorphiax","date":"2015-11-19T19:31:43.163+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"In this recent patch towers are way less defensive especially against the jungler here's why:\n\n- Red buff burns tower(New)\n- Golem buff grants 'gift of heavy hands' which gives 2 spells  this is the last one 'additionally, you can attack a tower to expend the buff early - dealing a large amount of bonus true damage (65 + 15 x level). This bonus can only be claimed once per spawn,'\n\n(This is probably why Riot made tower hp so high this patch which was actually quite smart)","replies":[]}]}
