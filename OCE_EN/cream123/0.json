But what if riot would make and update   where 3 players or 3 party can play summoners rift ranked 5v5. Like same as duo quene but trio quene, get it :P? I&#039;m sure that there are plenty of other people that would want the same. It would be cool as hell. And would probably decrease the amount of afks,trolls and stuff like that, and improve the overall gameplay experience. have had many times when I&#039;m in the solo/duo quene that there are afks, trolls, enemy team helpers. There are things like Leavebuster and report, but this won&#039;t compensate my league points that I may have lost because of 2 afks. It has hardened the ability to climb league and improve as a league of legends player overall. Also I know that many people would say that, &quot;oh it&#039;s pointless, because the diamond ones will climb their bronze friends to diamond&quot;. Bur like now there is that Bronze League player cannot play with for example a Gold League player.","replies":[{"poster":"Candy Kayn","date":"2015-11-02T09:35:46.383+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The issue is two many people queueing together ruins the experience for the enemy team, its getting to close to having a ranked team vs 5 solo queuers, not very fair!\n\nI see what your saying ofc and I feel other people should have explained this rather then randomly down voting :)\n\nSee you in soloqueue!
