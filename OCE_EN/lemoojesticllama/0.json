However, I am torn between Zed and Yasuo. At my level, I do not really need a very OP/broken champion (as some people call them), but rather a fun champ that does not make we bored after playing him 5 rounds straight.\r\n\r\nAll thoughts and comments are welcomed!","replies":[{"poster":"A steezy Scizor","date":"2017-02-17T01:28:16.308+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"fuck i actually answered legitimately in this thread jesus christ.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Sneed","date":"2017-02-16T21:31:14.545+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"what a fucking necro","replies":[]},{"poster":"VictroZ","date":"2017-02-16T16:02:54.999+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I find Zed more fun, he has those awesome shadows and you can swap places with them, which makes it easy to jump out of team fights, his R also swaps between shadows if used again. Yasuo? He is boring to me. Buy which one you like, everyone has his opinions. If you like Yasuo more, and find him fun to play, buy him.","replies":[]},{"poster":"sparklefart","date":"2015-03-19T04:51:49.749+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Zed only because he feels rewarding to 100-0 someone\n(not because i can't play yasuo)","replies":[{"poster":"LeMoojesticLlama","date":"2015-03-19T05:41:51.442+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"But Yasuo can do that to, can't he?

His animations are also (obviously) darker than Yasuo’s if that appeals to you.\n\nYasuo can block all skillshot projectiles and dash through multiple targets easily, and that could be fun for you. Also, if you like to knock up champions, he’s the champion for you. His animations are also (obviously) lighter than Zed’s if that appeals to you.","replies":[]},{"poster":"LeMoojesticLlama","date":"2015-03-19T06:58:56.119+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Bump.","replies":[]},{"poster":"LeMoojesticLlama","date":"2015-03-19T05:42:32.691+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thanks for the fast replies guys!
