I&#039;m not worried about his petty threats but I would really like this player to be banned for what he is doing I wouldn&#039;t wish a younger player in this community to go through something so ridiculous. I have the chat box open I can screen shot the chat logs ect just need some help from a RIOT employee","replies":[{"poster":"Akkordian Zoeve","date":"2017-10-16T04:03:16.086+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Screenshot the messages and submit them in a ticket to Riot Support.
