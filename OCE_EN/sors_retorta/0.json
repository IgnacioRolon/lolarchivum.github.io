Has anyone ever played a game of ARAM and it seems like some players are bots.\r\nFor instance...I was in queue late one night and i was in queue for about 10 mins. Then finally i got in game, and none of my team was communicating at all. Literally nothing. After consulting with some of the enemy team as well, apparently only two of them were talking or acting like humans. Throughout the entire game, the only impact on the game was me and these two enemies. The others behaved exactly like bots. Just curious as to whether anyone else can explain this or has experienced it as well.","replies":[{"poster":"aîdan","date":"2015-10-04T08:52:50.019+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I was in an ARAM game and someone was playing quite odd, (like a bot) and didn't think twice about it until an ally said is this brand (I don't remember who it was) a bot?

So they're setting up programs to for example grind accounts to 30 and sell them.\nThey're not the bots you encounter in CO-OP vs AI","replies":[{"poster":"aîdan","date":"2015-10-05T08:08:57.152+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"This would explain their summoner names.

Does my head in :l\nAnother thing that can help you notice them before the game starts is that they will never re-roll their champion and they neither accept nor decline trade offers. Also they don't talk. (Most of the time)\n\nOne bot I played with who had programmed speech. He'd say things like \"Wow, good job everyone!\" and \"Keep up the good work!\" at 5 minute intervals or something. I played 2 games with him and it was the exact same the following game as well. No doubt in my mind he was definitely a bot","replies":[{"poster":"Smeagi","date":"2015-10-04T13:26:05.472+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"the fun one was when i had a game [with nothing but bots](http://i.imgur.com/qchmKIC.png)","replies":[{"poster":"Plasmarine","date":"2015-10-05T01:43:31.541+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hahaha I had a similar game with a friend and it was 2 of us, with 3 bots.

The last 10 or so Aram games I've played with bots, I can even tell when they are before the game starts. Here's some pointers to see if you have bots in your Aram game. \n\n- They will always be running mark/ghost (The big one!) \n- They will always have a basic summoner icon (minion eg...) \n- They will most likely be playing a free champion (zilean, akali eg) \n- They won't move until the minions have spawned \n- They won't chat, ping and will most of the time tower dive and feed\n\nNow don't get me wrong, but every game since about a week ago of Aram I've encountered bots in the game. Usually, if there are more then two bots on your team, there will be at least 2 other bots on the enemy team. ( Not always!) \n\nThere was one situation when none of those tips applied, and that was very odd, as another bot didn't apply to any of those rules but just feeding. This has only appeared once though, so don't go ahead and think everyone who doesn't talk to you is a bot. But the basic bots always applies those rules! \n\nHoped this helped!","replies":[]}]}
