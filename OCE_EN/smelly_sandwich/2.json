You don't have the option to change an individual hero's item/weapons but among the 21 heroes they are significantly different; and they have Ultimates! The game is very polished and they will continue releasing more heroes and maps, so even though it's not free you get a lot of value for $40.\n\nI'd suggest watching some videos or streams of it before you decide.","replies":[{"poster":"DipperOCE","date":"2016-06-26T10:04:43.285+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"*$70 in Australia.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Essembie","date":"2016-06-29T10:07:24.307+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"overwatch is quite fun to be fair.
