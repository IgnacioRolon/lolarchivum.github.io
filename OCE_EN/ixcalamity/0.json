From the logs supplied the worst i said was: &quot;they bitch&quot; and &quot;dont give me ur crap&quot;. While the other THREE players on my team were tell graves to go die and would not stop intentionally feeding. Yet i get chat blocked for trying to defend a poor guy who is getting the hell abused out of him?.\r\n\r\nI realize 10 games is not much but i only enjoy ranked play (same for basically all my games) and this chat restriction makes it really hard to enjoy ranked as people in silver don&#039;t usually recognize pings or don&#039;t understand them 100%, 1 message every 4 mins is impossible to work with. Especially when a champ gets fed and your trying to explain how to deal with him in fights.\r\n\r\nNot completely sure if this in the right section but i tried to find it and this section sounded pretty legit considering its a support area.\r\n\r\nUnblocking chat restriction would be awesome if you deem it worthy.\r\nThanks for reading. \r\n\r\n(If this is wrong link me to correct area or move please)","replies":[{"poster":"Wuks","date":"2015-11-25T23:33:16.789+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey ix Calamity,\n\n\nAs this is a discussion pertaining to one of the Player Behavior & Reform systems [Chat Restriction] in League of Legends, the best place for this discussion would be the [**Player Behavior & Moderation**](http://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/player-behavior-moderation) sub-boards. I, another Arbiter, or a member of the community would love to have a more in-depth conversation with you about this topic there!","replies":[{"poster":"ixCalamity","date":"2015-11-26T08:08:05.126+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"cheers, put it up there","replies":[]}]}]}
