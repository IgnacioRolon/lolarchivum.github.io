Is that not how the system works or is it bugged? \r\n\r\nAlso, how many honours does it take to rank up?  I&#039;ve seen the loading screen  icon and it looks pretty sick.","replies":[{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2017-06-17T03:08:08.998+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You receive keys via honour in the sense that if you are dishonourable you won't receive key fragments. If you are level 2 or above you will gain key fragments pretty much as normal, but you might get some when you are offline and see them when you next logon.\n\nThe loading screen flair is a one game reward. If you are level 3 or above honour and get honoured by either 1 stranger or 2 premade friendos you'll get the loading screen flair for your next game.\n\nIf you get three or more honours in a game then you will get a little icon next to your name in post game visible to both teams with a little message that says \"x was the most honourable player on their team\".\n\nOnce you are at least level 3 you will also get capsule drops. You earn them the same way you get keys, just by playing, and they function as hextech chests that don't need a key to open. These capsules are how you get Medieval Twitch and Grey WW.\n\nNoone knows how long it takes to level up, just play positive and you'll get there eventually. You don't have to earn honours to rank up, just not earn any negatives essentially (these don't have to be in the form of punishments either, being a negative player in general is going to set you back) but obviously if you are earning honours you will rank up faster.","replies":[{"poster":"FBI MAN","date":"2017-06-17T04:17:08.434+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thank you, that answers all my questions :)","replies":[]}]}]}
