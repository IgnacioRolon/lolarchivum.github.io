My biggest issue with lee? He appears in every game, and every game he&#039;s mastery 7, in norms as well. \r\nADC - caitlyn\r\nSupp - thresh, blitz,\r\nTop - Riven\r\nMid - Yasuo\r\nJg - Lee Sin  \r\nNow im pretty sure u&#039;ve recognise this team comp before, there&#039;s nothing wrong with it, but in norms, it&#039;s the most tryhard, obnoxious team. This literally cuts down the champion selection to 15 champs, who needs originality right? Why not play all the skillful mobility champ cause ur a tryhard sweaty motherfcker who&#039;s hardstuck in bronze/silver and plays mains in norms to feel better. Lee sin especially the most fcking annoying af champ IM NOT SAYING HE&#039;S OVERPOWERED. seeing him in 90% of my games is fcking disgusting and sickening. The biggest issue with lee sin is the player, since he has a really good early game, anyone play lee sin is bound to have a good score at the first half of the game, this also increases their ego. In a lee sin player&#039;s minds, they think they&#039;re all faker babakush top shit which makes them wanna MAIN LEE SIN, makes them delusional, also makes me wanna strangle them, drown them or gut them (I&#039;m taking therapy) Hopefully with the new jgelr champ comming out, I genuinely hope players would spread out in picking their mains, or maybe even better, I hope the new champion hard counters lee sin.","replies":[]}
