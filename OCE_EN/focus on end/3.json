We understand that this news will leave all of you saltier then all of the worlds OCEANS combined, but alas, tis a new day, a day where there will be no OCEANia skin, this day will also be followed by days that contain no OCEANia skin.

Riot won the commercial lottery with League of Legends. The game picked up an enormous following, Riot made tons of cash and now they have an underutilised staff of hipster nerds who wear hoodies and sneakers to work led by an inexperienced management team. The lack of organisation, accountability and foresight will eventually kill League of Legends and, consequently, rito.","replies":[]},{"poster":"SEKAI","date":"2015-06-11T02:48:23.437+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I really don't think it's happening tbh,\n\nEspecially after the ocean week thing, I have already jumped ship on waiting for this skin.","replies":[{"poster":"Azirious Mistake","date":"2015-06-11T05:36:34.797+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Maybe there will be a teaser in the Ocean Week reef.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Quizmar","date":"2015-06-10T14:30:18.526+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"?","replies":[]}]}
