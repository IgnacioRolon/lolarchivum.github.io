Also his Q is actually EXTREMELY easy to dodge with quite a significant amount of damage and a long cooldown, IF HE MISSES HIS Q YOU MUST PUNISH HIM, There is basically no excuse, in a 1v1 situation, to EVER be stunned by his w.\n\n**The important part regarding Ekko&#039;s balance:**\n**Ekko is extremely reliant on hitting his Q and getting at least his shield from his w to win trades and fights, it is also extremely easy to dodge these Q&#039;s and draw him away from his w or simply give yourself distance while the shield disappears as he won&#039;t be able to pursue as he is confined to his bubble until he gets his shield, if you simply dodge his Q&#039;s and punish him when he does miss them then you&#039;re going to have a pretty easy time against him, keep track of where his R is and exploit it, make sure you spread out your damage as much as possible to minimise the heal he gets from his ultimate, overall great new champion it&#039;s a shame he&#039;s probably going to get gutted because of terrible players whinging instead of learning to use the enemy champions mechanics against him, I expect something similar to Darius a significant nerf after some time in the spotlight and never be seen again.**","replies":[{"poster":"Excited","date":"2015-05-30T16:35:52.281+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"As much as i dislike only corki, he actually has very valid points.\n\nEkko doesn't handle CC and burst.\n\nhard CC him and he is done!\n\n\nthink outside the box man.\n\nGL","replies":[{"poster":"Chocolate","date":"2015-05-31T03:08:02.864+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"By the way...

Yes, 70%, 80% and 2% per 100 AP missing health are high ratios when other champions have 40, 50 and 60% ratios.\n\n\n\n> Ekko&#039;s kit gives the ENEMY so much outplay potential, and I&#039;ve seen a lot of people I&#039;ve killed in game scream OP over all chat when I knock them down from a significant amount of HP to nothing, after they allow me to hit them with both parts of my Q applying two stacks and then still standing in range allowing me to drop my W before Eing to them, proccing the third stack and dealing an insane amount of burst and generally killing them with a q as they run.\n\nYou can outplay an instant reset and heal now? I didn't know that...  And I would assume they only stayed in range because your Q applies a 60% slow on both hits (after the first hit, the slow makes the second easy to hit), followed by an 80% slow after you proc the passive with a 750 range (READ: Longer than Katarina shunpo) gap closer which also gives you an 80% speed boost.\n\n\n> Ekko I feel is in a good place, I don&#039;t feel frustrated vsing him, I feel like he at best strong and would only need minor tweaks if anything, his R, W, AND Q are extremely forgivable, if you simply don&#039;t get near his ghost he can NEVER ULT YOU FOR DAMAGE!!!! Also his Q is actually EXTREMELY easy to dodge with quite a significant amount of damage and a long cooldown, IF HE MISSES HIS Q YOU MUST PUNISH HIM, There is basically no excuse, in a 1v1 situation, to EVER be stunned by his w.\n\nHE DOESN'T NEED TO ULT YOU FOR DAMAGE. HE HAS HIGH DAMAGE ON HIS PASSIVE AND Q. THE BONUS DAMAGE IS JUST MORE RIDICULOUS.\nI don't know what your definition of a long cooldown is, since mine is generally above 7 seconds. Otherwise, Xerath Qs and Nidalee spears are also on \"long cooldowns\". Also, Oh no, I missed my stun completely, now I only have the strongest base and 80% AP scaling shield in the game. \n\nYou know what else are extremely easy to dodge? Xerath stuns, Nidalee spears, Blitz hooks, Morgana bindings, Thresh hooks and Nautilus hooks. Those are _so_ short ranged, and travel just as slowly as Ekko's Q, and the projectile radius is smaller too! ... \n\n","replies":[{"poster":"Focus On End","date":"2015-05-31T03:38:17.201+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"1. 3 consistent slows? he has 1 consistent and two extremely hard to hit slows \n2. His double \"dash\" combined his shorter then a lot of champions single mobility ability\n3. He is confined to his circle to receive the shield, ask yourself this, if Ekko gets his shield will he win trade? Yes? walk away he want be able to pursue or he loses shield if the answer is no then trade, btw his w (his shield) has like a 25 seconds cd and he maxes it last.\n4. I dont know what you mean by instant reset and yeah there was a status effect invented to counter heals, it's called grievous wounds.\n5. you can still easily walk out of the second hit even when slowed, oh yeah and any champion with any dash of any kind, or better yet, just dont get hit by the first one since it's super easy to dodge? \n6. Combined damage of his Q = 「 Combined Damage: 120 / 160 / 200 / 240 / 280 (+ 80% AP) 」, His e damage =  50 / 80 / 110 / 140 / 170 (+ 20% AP), His passive proc = (+ 70% AP) not gonna post the base for every level its not much\n\nTotal of his passive + Q + E combo (best case scenario = 170% ap scaling. hey now lets compare this to Leblancs combo, 240% ap scaling (not including leblancs ultimate) \n\nSo an IDEAL Ekko combo has 170% ap scaling not including ult, Leblancs more reliable combo has 240% ap scaling not including ult, Ekko's damage seems to be over exaggerated to hell.\n\nThe comparison of those champions was pretty terrible, for example you compared xeraths long stun primarily used for cc to ekkos Q primarily used for damage, xerath will Q until there is a 100% chance his stun will hit, that comparison just showed how clueless you are, nidalee spears have like 3x the range and more damage, blitz hooks have far greater consequences for being hit... obviously it will be easy to dodge.... same with morg bindings, it's a 3 second snare... thresh hooks again idk why you are comparing cc abilities to a damage ability.\n\nSo all in all, Ekko's damage isn't anything amazing, his abilities are easy to dodge and exploit, and despite what you may think, he DOES need to hit his ult to win almost any 1v1 fight assuming both champions are evenly fed. btw the \"i screwed up button thing\" zed, leblanc, katarina, talon (his ult), Ahri, and many many many more assassins and any champion who takes flash all have I screwed buttons so... although, there \"I screwed up buttons\" dont have 130% ap scaling like Ekko's, Ekko might be trying to want to use his \"i screwed up button\" for damage not screw ups or I wouldn't suggest taking Ekko into ranked.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Best Viktor AU","date":"2015-05-31T02:34:03.558+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Dodge W and he can't land ult, that's just my experience.

Ekko just really isn't my personal preference for a champion in ranked so yeah I'm not worried about having my \"freelo\" being nerfed. http://www.lolking.net/summoner/oce/365703#profile, also as for my Graves win rate, fk knows how it's that good, I just play him when I'm forced to ADC and I seem to win a lot.\n\nNote: I would like to remind you that Ekko is an Assassin, he's supposed to kill you, if you let him fully combo you. the amount of people who have said over all in normals \"WOWEOW DIS CHAMP DO SO MUCH DMGSSSSS\" after they let me Q them both ways, and then I wait till the last second of the passive stacks to E in, so that my Q has the shortest possible cd so I can get two Q's into the one combo and then proceed to ultimate them, because they have literally let me bash their head in for over 4 seconds so my shadow is now directly under them and I, this is why assassins get nerfed, all of them, people are bad, and don't know how to counterplay. All the enemy had to do, was not get hit by the easiest to dodge projectile in the game, or if they somehow do, back away till the stacks disappear so that I can't E in and proc the third stack instantly.","replies":[]},{"poster":"noogai","date":"2015-05-31T00:33:22.626+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Wat.

And the frenzy over \"outplaying\" as if every champ should win against anybody if you have twitchy enough fingers, which is Wrong in this type of game, doesn't help either.\n\nNot to mention, in order to keep their overloaded champs afloat, they intentionally initiate and continue the program of systematically removing all target/reliable CC's just to make sure that mobility and kit sizes will remain as king, actual counterplays be damned because all it matters is people hopping around key spamming to look flashy.\n\nThe current LoL is no longer the one I fell in love with, man.\n\nIf you wanna feel overpowered at your own leisure, please go APRGs like Diablo.

There are 2 places LoL will most likely end up imo,\n\n1. Everyone gets tired of Riot's inconsistency and betrayal (ditch the old players in favour of new ones) in their attempts to appeal to everyone while catching no one in the end of the day, and everyone leaves thus LoL becomes a thing of the past. \nOr,\n2.

Mechanically intense champs take a while to get a hang of, but that doesn't mean they are hard to play in an actual game, because there is always an option under any situation.\n\nWhat do you say, which \"outplay\" is harder? Trying to outsmart another person with 4 buttons that has a more punishing resource and CD system, or with 8 skills that has a less meaningful resource and CD system?\n\nOverloaded kits in the grand scheme of things, is actually making the game simpler and easier instead of harder. When everyone is equally overloaded the concept of conterpicking and counterbuilding will mostly vanish and conterplaying would become a debate of \"who has faster fingers\". The weight of all other points in the game skill sections will also be nullified, making the game less taxing on the overall skill department.\n\nI have stated it many times somewhere else before and I will say it again.\n\n* There is a limit on how overloaded a champ should be in this type of game.\n* There should be pre-defined weaknesses instead of relying solely on the players' mechanical fault to play against them.\n* Champs should have restrictions on what they can do, and what they simply can't, that's the point of having this title as a team game.\n*  The amount of synergies a champ could have should be limited, infinite possibility sounds great on paper, but when we translate that into actual practice in a competitive game it would only spell out broken.\n*  LoL isn't an ARPG nor is it a fighting game, mechanical and game skill should both exist and not only favour just one.

According to who? You? \n\"_There should be pre-defined weaknesses instead of relying solely on the players mechanical fault_\" What the actual fk, basic champions with very little mechanical value are the champiosn that DON'T have clearly defined weaknesses and are impossible to outplay because there is no possible mistake you could force them to make, for example, if a nasus is pimp caning ur fucking skull in there's really nothing you can do to stop this, but lets say Ekko is chasing you, you can dash to a side dodging all of his Q damage, then avoid his R shadow, wait for his shield to dissipate and then kill him when he's on CD's, _**What you're saying makes no sense**_\n\"_Champs should have restictions on what they can do, and simply cant_\" Every single champ does, so Idk what the fk you're talking about, an assassin can't just build tank and still be of use because they have little to no useful cc, a tank cant just build damage because their kit doesnt scale with damage, No champ does everything and no champ does nothing (except maybe bard), so this statement also completely random and no relevance.\n\"_The amount of synergies a champ could have should be limited_\" Synergies are heavily limited...? Very few champs can just slot into any team comp with zero thought, and those that can, it's actually refreshing and interesting because of how rare it is.\n\"_mechanical and game skill should both exist and not only favour just one.
