They also rivalled League's active player base in 2014 (bear in mind it's much harder to set up smurf accounts through Steam). The MOBA market is a duopoly at worst, and I don't understand how Riot own the entire gaming market when they only operate on 1/4 major gaming platforms.\n\n> a game with some content and fun gameplay with interesting game modes can actually get the support it needs to flourish\n\nHow are Riot actively preventing indie devs from getting support? They also give their employees $300 p/a to spend on other games.\n\n> crappy game with like 120 2d champs and one 2d map\n\nAre you sure you're playing the right game? \n\n> making some chinese billionaire richer everyday\n\nRiot actually started as an indie dev and are based in the US. They were initially funded by several US venture capital firms, and are now owned by parent company Tencent - the biggest shareholders of which are US-based institutions. \n\n\nI was really bored this morning.","replies":[{"poster":"kJs","date":"2015-06-29T00:47:46.066+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Amidst the salt and rage, he's semi-right about the \"20 champs viable/time\". \n\nThere's not really anything Riot can do about top tier champions thy dominate LCS and Ranked Matches. If there weren't the cream on top of the milk the game would be really boring. \nA couple of seasons ago it was Kassadin mid, Talon mid, and Leblanc mid. \nHecarim and Nocturne dominated the jungle. \nRenekton was the sole king of top lane. \nEzreal, Vayne, Caitlyn would be seen every game. Especially Ezreal though. \n\nLast season it was more dynamic. No one champion dominated the jungle for the the whole season, maybe Lee sin did but ehh.","replies":[]}]}]}
