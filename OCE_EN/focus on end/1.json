Altho they didn&#039;t really invent it, but whatever, FK YOU RIOT. The funny thing is, Riot has morons that brain washed that they will read this and still believe that Riot actually cares about eSports, we are moving into the age where people spend more time talking online then in real life, online gaming will be a thing riot or not, yet they milk it like fking leeches and actually have the nerve to say they are doing this for eSports LOL. So Riot if you actually give a flying fk about eSports, then really you should automatically give everyone from level ONE access to every rune and a flawless replay system should be your number 1 priority, look at the runes every pro player uses, they have almost if not every single rune unlocked, 10 pages, and up to 3 or 4 pages just for a few champions put under slightly different situation, yet when you hit level 30, you wont even have enough IP for 2 solid rune pages worth of runes, if you have farm for hundreds of hours of game time just to get the fking runes to play at a competitive level LOOOOOOOOOL and fk all champions. /rantover","replies":[{"poster":"GoldenTomat0","date":"2015-04-23T07:28:21.904+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":3,"body":"\"blah blah blah, no replay system, i can't form coherent sentences, I'm a huge knob\"\nthat's all i got from reading this. surprised i managed to read all of it tbh.","replies":[{"poster":"Focus On End","date":"2015-04-23T07:35:03.685+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"goldenfkwit, everyone always hated you, guess nothings changed.

But Riot is a company and companies exist for the sole purpose of making money if you spend IP on runes the more likely you are to have to buy champs with RP guess that's why they make runes such a massive IP sink.","replies":[]},{"poster":"VENI VIDI VICI","date":"2015-04-24T08:37:49.301+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Was just thinking about that... Shouldn't have to BUY runes.. I've spent nearly 60days of in-game time and still have only a quarter of the runes and have about 20 champs left to get.... Fair enough for the champs but WHY THE HELL do we not have access to the runes that the pros do ey??? What if I've been losing jungle ever since season 5 came out because I didn't havee the right runes to get me through to dam lvl 2.. It's not fair. Also, Esports is a win-win for Rito. Including the reasons you mentioned- it also helps them balance the game and scale things, make notes etc of popular trends and so they can better their game for the masses.. Riot this no runes thing is bullshit.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Garens Harem","date":"2015-04-23T13:49:15.118+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"lol that guy","replies":[]},{"poster":"dat hook","date":"2015-04-23T07:32:08.190+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"AGERE BOY COTT ROTI FUCK EM","replies":[]}]}
