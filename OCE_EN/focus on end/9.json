He can only W an enemy champion after he applies 3 stacks of his passive on them.\n2. He suffers a 95% movespeed slow while carrying an enemy champion.\n3. It lasts 2-3 seconds so youre not really going to be carrying them far without outside mobility such as thresh w, bard e, kalista ult etc.\n4. Tahm can choose between either the shield for 100% of recent damage or heal for a percentage of the damage hes taken recently,\n5. The shield decays over 4 seconds.\n6.
