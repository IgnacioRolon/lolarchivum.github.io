She has an easily landed slow, and a snare, with a HUGE damage ult. The slows and snares do insane amounts of damage to him, forcing him to ult to live, and then i go for the kill with a snare>ult combo.\n\nMight have just been a bad ekko, but good positioning and landing your skillshots with lux means ehe has absolutely no chance to use his E and if you avoid his other abilities you're laughing.","replies":[{"poster":"kJs","date":"2015-06-01T11:56:56.885+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Doesn't Ekko just dash out of everything?","replies":[{"poster":"Focus On End","date":"2015-06-02T05:26:52.822+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"das a nice dash ekko can i do that every .2 seconds :-) ~ Yasuo","replies":[]},{"poster":"noogai","date":"2015-06-02T03:24:40.128+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"If you've slowed him with the E, no, you can generally tag him with your Q afterwards.

You throw out one CC ability, he dashes to dodge that. You throw out your second, he blinks to the adjacent minion or blink to you past your snare if he's close enough.\n\nI think you're just playing against bad Ekkos. If Ekko is smart he won't engage Lux unless her snare is on CD.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Chicken4dinner","date":"2015-06-01T13:05:47.199+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=kJs,realm=OCE,application-id=Ntey9fRZ,discussion-id=GxfZpKAE,comment-id=00000000,timestamp=2015-06-01T11:56:56.885+0000)\n>\n> Doesn't Ekko just dash out of everything?\n\nOr into, I have had him execute me by rolling over walls while I am recalling and jumping on me","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"oops","date":"2015-06-01T10:29:12.811+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Played on a silver smurf today.

The shield from your Q will take all the magic damage from his passive and when the Q return. Do that a lot and you will have an out farm kass againts a no item ekko after 10 mins. Then you can do whatever you want to do with him.","replies":[]}]}
