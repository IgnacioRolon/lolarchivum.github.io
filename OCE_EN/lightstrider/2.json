Blood pumps frantically through my veins, a resounding din echoing in my ears. I take a swig of water, the frozen elixir reviving my aching throat. Sitting down on the summit, pounded smooth by years of rain, I squint at the vast green vista that extends infinitely towards the horizon, as golden sunlight dances across my face. With my heart slowing down to a jog I glance at my toned body, carved from marble, and rest my long slender katana on my greaves, unblemished silver in the light. A harsh static assaults my ears, a rhythmic drone and distant chatter mixing with the sharp scent of disinfectant.\n\n\nA sakura petal, translucent pink silk, flutters past on a backdrop of viridian trees when the scenic view begins flickering, distorting with increasing urgency. I look around in confusion, random fragments of my environment disintegrating. Perfectly rendered colours are suddenly lurid, strings of code are fraying like thread. Countless error messages begin to appear, flashes of glowing silver and ruby. The flawless reality around me is crumbling. A sigh involuntarily escapes my mouth as the petal bursts into a mass of pixels and dissolves.\n\n\n&ldquo;_System error detected, your session has been terminated. We apologise for the inconvenience._&rdquo; A voice rings out in perfect mechanical cadence, a beautiful synthetic symphony. I rip of my goggles in frustration, flinching, harsh fluorescent lights reflected by the stainless steel walls. I fiddle with the console in an empty effort to reconnect myself, but even as I impotently tap the vivid holographic display, I know it&rsquo;s to no avail. &ldquo;_Full Dive VR system offline, awaiting Summoner maintenance_&rdquo;.\n\n\nI groan and slump onto the stiff anti-plastic chair with a thud, the musty synthetic leather covering greasy and soaked with the sweat and stains of the hundreds before me. I glance at my watch, the maddening ticking of the hands in sync with the drone of the console. I place my head in my bony hands, pale and slender. As I raise my vision to the cold metal walls, an emaciated, haggard visage stares back at me. He touches his hollow cheeks and unkempt beard, his eyes as weary as his soul.\n\n\nI turn away, repulsed. The virtual reality machines had been heralded as a revolution, created by Viktor to allow champions to experience wonders beyond their wildest dreams. But now, the once golden machines have been reduced to re-enactors of past memories, buried in ubiquity. Champion halls and private residences are now filled with variations of these machines, charging a small price to function as distractions, allowing champions to escape the day-to-day drudgery of their life. Some seek to escape their battles, sick of fighting. I just want to run from myself. I don&rsquo;t want to see my gaunt reflection, the obsidian eyes void of hope and filled with the despair that I couldn&rsquo;t save the ones who believed in me.\n\n\nThese hours of peace are the sole reason I continue to grind through my day, nothing but a single gear in a tremendous, ever evolving machine. Perfect performance is the expectation, any fault will result in an immediate fall from the meta. After all, standard protocol for a faulty champion is a redesign and replacement with another excitable cog who has yet to have their excitement nerfed out of them. My heart longs to visit the world beyond these borders, to once again experience its marvels, but my mind knows just how inaccessible that is, an infinite gap between reality and dreams.\n\n\nMy mind flashes back. I remember the desperation, the metallic scent of blood. The world seems to race by in a blur of muted colours: an irregular smudge of scarlet pixels. A long dirty streak of murky emerald. A friend? _Family_? I can&rsquo;t tell. The world I once cherished moves past me. The ones I loved lost, barely out of reach.\n\n\n&quot;**_Ding_**&rdquo;\n\n\n&ldquo;_This is Summoner Light, requesting Yasuo for a classic game on Summoner&rsquo;s Rift in one minute. Thank you for your co-operation._&rdquo; I rise unsteadily, my legs aching as blood revitalised them. I stagger haltingly towards the large doors to the Great Hall, groaning as they swing wide, runes glowing dimly.\n\n\nI take a step forwards. &ldquo;Tick&hellip;_Tick_&hellip;_**Tick**_&rdquo;, the clock unable to match the frenzy with which my heart beats. The sight that awaits me is an endless ocean of towering steel, a perfect monument to the &quot;_triumph_&quot; of the Institute of War. Nonetheless, what I feel isn&rsquo;t a sense of awe, but a crushing sense of disillusionment, just another blurred perception of reality that can&rsquo;t be touched: an imperfect reality that is less vibrant and more subdued.\n\n\nIs this really why I stumble through my melancholy existence? Is this where I wish to live and fight for the rest of my days, chained against my will?\n\n\nThe only difference between this reality and the one I have constructed is that it is like a long dream from which I cannot awake. It is a dream that isn&rsquo;t bound by how long it takes for a Nexus to fall, a dream that is not rendered with a perfect graphics interface, forced to move against my will by an invisible force.\n\n\n&ldquo;**_Ding_**&rdquo;\n\n\n&ldquo;_This is once again Summoner Light, requesting Yasuo to prepare for combat in thirty seconds. On a side note, I am pleased to inform you that all Full Dive VR systems have been restored to online status. We thank you for your patience._&rdquo;\n\n\nI silently contemplate my choice. Deliberately turning my back to the open doors, I retreat to my cabin, the cold Institute of War already replaced in my mind with an infinite green vista, a velvet sakura petal floating by in the wind.\n\nWord Count: 965 words\n\n_Authors Note:_\n_I really wanted to write a piece about the unseen side of league, how the champions who fight everyday feel. Surely some must feel disillusioned, homesick and wanting to leave? Well, I expanded upon that concept, drawing inspiration from the Project Skins Trailer as well as the login screen of Yasuo, the beautiful sakura in both cases hiding a tragic past. Leave a comment if you liked it or had any improvements.  I hope that you will enjoy reading it as much I did writing this.\n_\n\n-Light","replies":[]}
