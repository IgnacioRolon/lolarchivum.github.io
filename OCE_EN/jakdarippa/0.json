I know it is a &#039;fun&#039; mode but it just creates an unfair advantage when one team can perpetually group heal at such capacity and the other team can&#039;t recall. I&#039;ve played thousands of ARAM games as the only mode I enjoy after all these years (Except the special events like URF) and even less than optimal players with a Sona carry their teams to a win. It&#039;s flat out unfair as a result of the game mode mechanic of not being able to recall and please just perma ban her from it. Please this is my only request of you after years of being a loyal customer.","replies":[{"poster":"Project Xayah","date":"2015-04-28T12:03:12.770+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"Stop complaining about a **RANDOM** game mode, the chances of it being fair in any situation is slim at best.

We're talking about a **RANDOM** based game mode, you can't expect it to be fair most times. In fact you can't expect it to be fair ever.

Soraka's heals is 100% OP in ARAM and Soraka can sustain herself with her Q and since this is ARAM people will just go full offensive on items and Soraka heals work with more AP and her Ult is completely broken in ARAM. Although i main Soraka i don't think she should be allowed to play in ARAM because it is almost a guaranteed win if Soraka is in the game.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Ritual","date":"2015-04-28T12:33:29.947+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"oom = out of mana\nhe ooms if she just heals heals... possibly the assists with unholy grail would allow her to heal without oom but still oom{{item:3174}}","replies":[]},{"poster":"Chicken4dinner","date":"2015-04-29T08:52:00.247+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"{{champion:267}}","replies":[]},{"poster":"sparklefart","date":"2015-04-29T04:27:59.855+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Sonas can't heal the whole team, only said person and herself\n+ so much fun one hitting people with q+passive proc","replies":[]}]}
