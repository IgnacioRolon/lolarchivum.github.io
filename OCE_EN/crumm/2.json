It comes down to your memory and processing power. I had a look at the specs on the Toshiba and the AMD processor you have in that computer is equivalent to a lower end Intel i3 processor. If you want to play games I would recommend you to upgrade to an i5 at the least. Apart from that you have a 4GB Ram, I think those Toshibas can also take on an added 4GB of Ram so you have 8GB in total memory. Again nothing to do with a GPU, I have a Nvidia GTX 485 which is a windows vista model graphics card. \n\nIn general the client settings have a full repair troubleshooter, settings is located next to the close button. You can also lower down the window size and disable the animations. \n\nApart from that the dev team have an amazing job on the client. I have been testing the alpha for the past 6 months and the beta for past alpha testers we have seen an amazing turn around for the beta. Some people may have problems, but lets face it, it is a beta there is still some work needed here and there. But all in all, a upgraded machine would be a wise option. Not just for league but for everyday use and longer life. \n\nI hope you found this useful.\n\n-RK.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Darcy","date":"2016-11-11T05:36:53.686+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"I have a 6700K and GTX 980 Ti and the client is extremely laggy for me.","replies":[]}]}
