I usually play and 60 FPS with minor drops of 5-10 but it seems I am now dropping to round 25 FPS in the majority of my games I have also been experiencing more than usual bug-splat errors. Today I had 1 when i was trying load into a RGM, then upon reconnecting it proceeded to do this another 3 times with each time my client doing a full repair. \r\nGot any advice/help for me? Would be greatly appreciated.","replies":[{"poster":"Tele","date":"2018-04-02T02:51:56.672+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey Crumm,\n\nSorry for the late reply. If you're still having this problem, try the following in order:\n\n+ Confirm that your resolution settings are the same as before. It's possible things got reset to a high resolution on the new patch. Also check to see if lowering the resolution fixes the problem.\n\n\n+ I assume you have restarted your PC, but if not, do that now and check to see if the game is working fine again.\n\n\n+ Download and install the [Hextech Repair Tool](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/224826367-Automated-Troubleshooting-Hextech-Repair-Tool). Open it, select _Force Repatch_ and press _Start_. Once the client has re-patched, open up League and see if the issue has been fixed.\n\n\nIf none of that works, then let me know and I'll see what else we might be able to do :)","replies":[]}]}
