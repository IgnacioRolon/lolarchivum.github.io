I started checkpoint 3 level 2 and I have friends that started below me that are a higher honor level than me. I can&#039;t tell if this is a bug or i&#039;m just unlucky. Can someone please shed some light.","replies":[{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2018-04-06T11:57:06.471+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Honour is variable by player. Perhaps these others are being positive in their games as opposed to just neutral. Perhaps you had a few salty games which slowed you down a bit. It's impossible for us to know, we don't have the context.\n\nn the end though, Honour is for you, not for anyone else (that's why it's hidden except for flairs). It's something for you to be proud in your progress of, not envious of others. Instead of wondering what everyone else is doing, why not consider what you could do differently? Honour is about your behaviour not theirs after all. If you want to earn it faster, what can you do to achieve that?","replies":[]},{"poster":"cia√¥","date":"2018-04-06T09:08:41.606+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"fuck this game","replies":[]}]}
