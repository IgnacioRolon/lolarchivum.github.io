Your kill participation for that game was only 53%. Up near 70%+ you are FAR more likely to net an S.\n\nOf course, if everything is happening top lane in the early game getting that participation up is hard, and deaths are a little too punishing for supports, it is why they have talked about re-tuning the mastery grades for supports. \n\nAll in all it's about more than KDA. It's about warding, it's about objectives, it's about participation and teamwork.","replies":[]},{"poster":"BarryButcher","date":"2016-06-19T14:59:55.327+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Don't die. Literally. The only way to do it is not die and have a blinder.\nI watched Aphromoo stream to try and get S for his champ mastery. He basically worked out if you die more than twice you can't get higher than S- and you need 2-3 kills too.\n\nI got my S on Morg from this game: http://matchhistory.oce.leagueoflegends.com/en/#match-details/OC1/124934900/200743579?tab=overview\n\nI went 4-1-23.
