If you know someone is torrenting, or if someone is currently using Youtube, and other things that happen before you click the 'Play' button, then sure, don't play. The things that can come up out of the blue like someone watching youtube after you've already started the game or similar things, that's fair enough, you can really only control yourself.  Saying if they 'might browse' is just like saying you can only play if you're home alone. You 'might' have a car crash. Because you knew you 'might' have a car crash, the crash is your fault regardless of how it happens because you got behind the wheel while knowing. OFC thats not true, context is important. saying 'might' is unreasonable. \n\nI don't see how you can ruin nine peoples time. sure the other team might say 'sorry for the 4v5' but ultimately you're ruining four other people time. you just gave the other five an easier win or a \"how did we lose to four people\" loss.\n\nEDIT: I'm just wondering, but how bad was the loss that made you come on here to give this special news bulletin post?
