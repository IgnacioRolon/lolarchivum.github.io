If they're not getting the message by then, they probably still wont after 10 more messages and all you'll achieve is to distract yourself from the game and often end up making people pissed off at you or each other. \n\nSounds like you tilt a bit too, just focus on what YOU can do to win the game and don't worry so much about your team. Sure, sometimes your team are idiots and you lose a perfectly winnable game, that's just how it is.
