I mean, they're always in win-win situation where it's either they get their way or the team goes down with them.  (Which they'll get those twisted satisfaction out of it)\n\nSometimes I really wonder if I should troll and see how fun it is to have others LP at your mercy, and there is absolutely nothing they can do about it.\n\n\nEDIT: In case you're wondering, yes, I did dodge that, and that's the 3rd straight dodge without playing a ranked since last night. (I definitely have lost about 21LP thus far just from dodging those kind of games)\n\nMy patients is running really thin with this game over the years, ~~hopefully I don't have to dodge the next one~~\n\nActually fuck it, I'm not playing a game today, I'll just go play something offline instead. Maybe some JRPG.","replies":[{"poster":"Iosua Bot","date":"2015-06-09T23:50:33.959+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"lel:\nIf you want to win, u will go supp","replies":[]},{"poster":"Crowd Pleasa","date":"2015-06-09T15:50:42.035+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"If you want to get better at the game follow this advice.
