I feel like being in a Ranked 5&#039;s environment will allow me to further improve as opposed to Solo Queue, where I&#039;m starting to find all sorts of toxic players.\n\nAs a player I generally excel at mechanical play, although my game knowledge is a bit lackluster. My best champs right now are  {{champion:22}}, {{champion:15}}, {{champion:67}}, {{champion:236}} and {{champion:42}} in no particular order, although I can play most other AD carries to a Diamond level. I&#039;m also working on my {{champion:429}}  as she&#039;s a very strong pick at the moment.\n\nIf you&#039;re interested in picking me up or trying me out, don&#039;t hesitate to add me in-game.\n\nThanks.","replies":[]}
