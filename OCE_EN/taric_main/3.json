This ONLY happens when I queue fill. If I queue for specific roles (both Draft and Ranked Solo/Duo) I don&#039;t encounter this issue. \r\n\r\nI am now having to deal with a 30 minute timer because the client is messing up. \r\n\r\nIs this an issue that other people are experiencing? I&#039;ve look throughout and there has been mention of latency causing the problem however I&#039;ve run tests with my latency and I&#039;m receiving the usual 19-20MS so it&#039;s highly unlikely that it&#039;s that. \r\n\r\nAny fixes to this? It&#039;s quite annoying queuing for a game (as fill because I don&#039;t really mind what roles I&#039;m playing) to not be able to lock in my champ and then have to face a queue time for an issue that apparently has been plaguing the client since the change over. \r\n\r\nReally poor experience if you ask me especially for players who don&#039;t dodge (I don&#039;t dodge unless the client has something like this). \r\n\r\nWould be nice to hear back from some one.","replies":[]}
