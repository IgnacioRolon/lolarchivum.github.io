Essentially I&#039;m going W &gt; E, where as usually has to be E &gt; W by the looks of it.  \r\n\r\nI have to E then W and that kinda seems counter intuitive. ANyone find this same issue?\r\n\r\n{{sticker:zombie-brand-clap}}","replies":[{"poster":"MCFishBones","date":"2016-05-23T21:54:48.327+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"reactivate your e early so there is no delay and it knocks them back instantly.{{sticker:slayer-jinx-catface}}","replies":[]}]}
