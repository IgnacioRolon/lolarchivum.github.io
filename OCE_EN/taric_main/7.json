Capable of a decent amount of control and movement but requiring some good positioning and game knowledge to pull it off. \n\nI put a bit of work into this doing a bit of a back story etc. \n\nEssentially this champ is kind of a frost elemental humanoid, able to dissolve to this liquid state and then pop into fights out of no where. \n\nIdeas for mana costs, numbers (damage etc) any other input greatly appreciated. -&gt; Ideally my idea for damage and numbers was good base with suboptimal scaling to allow for strong early/mid game presence to then falling back to a ultility/support role the longer the game went on. Peeling for the backline etc. \n\n**edit**: I'd initially called the champ \"Frost\" with earlier iterations but changed it to Hail as I felt it was more suited. \n----\n**Hail, the Blizzard&#039;s Envoy**.\n\nBorn into a reclusive tribe of Frejlord, Hail was taught the ways of the tribes Shamans from a young age. Little did he know that the tribe was slowly being preparing him for what the elders of his clan have always said to be the greatest honour. After years of training and conditioning Hail&#039;s gruelling trials would begin.\n\nHail&#039;s 16th birthday was one spent different to many. Alone with a single elder and in the frozen temperatures of the Frejlord,he was sent into the Frozen Abyss to recover a lost Venhylder tribe artefact. \n\nAfter days spend in the desolated tundra, Hail and the Elder reached the ancient ruins which his clan inhabited many aeons ago. The elder told Hail that the artefact they were looking for was an amulet that belong to the first High Shaman and would allow Hail the power to commune with the natural world. Hail was confused why they hadn&#039;t just kept the amulet and handed it down, but he wasn&#039;t one to question tradition.\n\nSearching the dark catacombs beneath the ruins, Hail stumbled upon a pool of pure water where the amulet was to be. Hail thought that maybe it was in the pool. Which wouldn&#039;t seem too odd. The pool had this ominous, yet pure white glow lighting up the crevice it was in and in all the stories he was told as a child; important things often were in the most obvious places ready for the taking. Hail reached into see what he could find, however before he could reach the bottom of the pool, the water began to freeze around his arm, slow encasing his body in ice. A face in the ice looked to be coming towards Hail but it was too late. \n\nSlowly behind him the elder walked in, as Hail could feel his body going cold. Looking to the Elder he asked for help, but no a single cry came from his mouth. Hail slowly was finding he couldn&#039;t control his body, nothing would move. His mouth wouldn&#039;t open, nor could he make a sound. Eventually all he could see was darkness. \n\nHail woke up to find the bloodied body of the elder frozen cold, shattered within the room. Frozen shards of his blood covered the walls. Hail could feel his body again, but this time it was different. There was no heat, no warmth, no fire. Just cold, wet ice. He looked and found a note in the Elder&#039;s robes. It explained that there was no trial, no amulet, nothing. This was all a farce to get Hail to the cavern of Ice and complete his transformation. \n\nPerplexed and distraught Hail began to run out of the catacombs, out from the ruins. Running away as fast as he could. Hopefully he could leave all this behind. Maybe he could reverse what had been done. He wasn&#039;t ready for this. As he ran he felt his body begin to melt. Slowly he began to slip out of conciousness again, falling to the ground. As he fell he&#039;d noticed that an eerie fog began to blanket the land, but before too long. He was too late. Hail had lost conciousness.\n\nAs he came to, in the distance, a strange figure appeared in the fog. A tall slender woman coaxing Hail to her. Promising to teach Hail how to control his new body, the woman then placed her hand upon Hail&#039;s freezing chest. Small black ice crystals began to coalesce over Hail&#039;s body, slowing the rate he was turning to liquid. Little did Hail know, this was a witch, set out on making him her subordinate and taking his power. The crystals she used for him to maintain control of his body, would react and grow with negative emotions. Any dark or painful feelings would fuel this ice, turning Hail into a primal killing machine. \n\nHail thanked the strange woman and left quickly headed to the village to try find what was happening to his body.\n\nHail approached his father, one of the elders of the clan. It&#039;s here Hail discovered the truth. Hail was to be a vessel for the Ice, to be used as a weapon should the tribe come into danger. Commanding powerful ice to destroy those who would threaten their existence. \n\nHail was confused, this was never discussed before. Hail felt betrayed, stripped of his own life for the tribes. This wasn&#039;t the life he wanted, nor the life he had envisioned. \n\nFeeling betrayed and hurt Hail ran to the outskirts of the village, to a nearby lake where he&#039;d pretend to be playing with his imaginary brothers and sisters. It was here that Hail heart turned dark.\n\nDwelling and stewing on the negative emotions, Hail began to cry in anger. As he felt more and more betrayal and sorrow,  the small black crystals of ice grew larger and larger. To a point where they began to overtake his body. Shattering his physical form Hail had become on with the ice, this wasn&#039;t the normal white ice that Hail was accustomed to seeing, but a black and grey slush. \n\nHail consciousness began to fade, eventually giving into the primal rage stewing inside. \n\nUpon the mountain sides a large black cloud began to approach the village, villagers and tribesmen looked in awe. The Elders warned that a mystical threat approached. But nothing prepared them for this. In desperation they looked for their protector, the villagers scrambled about screaming awaiting salvation. Upon seeing the centre of he storm, their resolve shattered. It was the one made to protect them.\n\nHowling frozen winds ravaged the land, those caught in the storm were slowly frozen freezing more and more as the sleet ran over their bodies. Turning himself into a puddle of frozen fury Hail began to quickly travel to the centre of the village. The Elder&#039;s Conclave. Sliding beneath the foundations, Hail&#039;s dark, misguided intentions became revealed. To destroy those who created him, so they no one will go through this deceit and pain again. Soon the grounds began to shake, rumbling and ever increasing winds began to howl faster and faster. Within a split second the water and ice began to take form. The form of giant spikes erupting from the ground. Impaling buildings and people alike. \n\nHail&#039;s father looked at him in despair. It was with this Hail&#039;s actions had become clear to him. The rage inside had subsided and his humanity once again revealed. Out of the ice, the woman returned. Commending Hail on his action, Hail&#039;s shock soon turned to disgust. Demanding this woman leave Hail encased the witch in ice, crushing her. It was at this time his memory had come clear.  The face in the water, was the witch. The one who&#039;d killed the Elder was the witch and she&#039;d manipulated the ritual, so instead of becoming attuned to the frost, Hail would become the frost itself.\n\nWhen it was too late to stop Hail had realised the mistake he&#039;d made. Slowly he began to freeze what remained village to preserve their culture and life. For his horrific act, hail swore to vigilantly watch his people for the rest of eternity and hunt the witch who sullied the Attunement and wanted him to destroy his village.. \n\n\n\n**Champion Select Quote: **&quot;With retribution in my heart and my bonds strengthening my resolve&quot;\n\n**Level 1 Stats:**\n_Attack range: 225\nMovement speed: 330\nHP:580\nHP/level: 87\nHP/5: 8\nMana: 393\nMana/level: 45\nMP5: 4\nAttack damage: 57\nAD/level: 2.65\nAttack Speed: 0.58\nAS/Level: +2.9%\nArmor: 28\nA/Level: +3.2\nMR: 32\nMR/Level:1.257_\n\n\n\n_Passive_: **Sleet** - spell casts and auto attacks deals 2%AP as bonus damage and leave a field of ice based on HP.
