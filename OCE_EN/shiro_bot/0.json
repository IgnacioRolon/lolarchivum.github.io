What i mean is it chooses a random ward skin that you own and it places it or it keeps a random ward skin each game. Maybe we can have a selection of what ward skin we want to use as well. I want this is because i feel like i own way to much ward skins and i never get to use some of them, because im either forget to change or i run out of time because i was afk doing something else.","replies":[{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2019-05-02T12:59:53.537+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Right??
