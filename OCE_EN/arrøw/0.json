There is countless forums of people begging for URF and what do we get instead? 2 weekends of One for all -_- yay! and lets not forget 3 Poro Kings is coming up. Yes i know URF was a little annoying with people picking the \"OP\" champs but so what! URF is fun and we want to have fun!!!! Not play stupid slow paced normals/ranked or ARAM all the time. HOW MANY TIMES MUST WE PLAY THE SAME BORING MODE FOR. Furthermore who cares if people use Zed all the time.. WE WANTED URF! Weve been asking for this mode to be permanent or at least in customs for years but this company is to stubborn to bother with that. Riot already stole the ability to play hide and seek from us (Dominion in customs) without asking and ive had enough.\n\nThe main issue i read from both players and Riot is that \"URF gets boring after awhile\" and thats completely fine to think that, if you get bored of it then go back to your toxic normals or ranked games but leave URF for the rest of us that WANT this mode!. Why should all of us suffer because of this one thought. Having URF 24/7 will NOT impact the health of the game, there will still be plenty of people in the other modes.\n\nIm sorry but we need some better game designers or management in Riot, someone who will actually listen. League of Legends was once a great game but poor design choices and not fixing them have bred a toxic community and repetitive game play. Just go to Surrender@20 and look at all the posts weekly and see how many champs get nerfed/buffed or edited in some kind of way. Every week without fail there is always pending changes for a champ and for a game thats been out for years thats just sad that they cant find the middle ground. Just give us URF and bring back the Crystal Scar for customs! i want my hide and seek back.","replies":[{"poster":"No Keyboard 360","date":"2016-12-11T06:15:08.077+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"well said I agree completely\n{{sticker:slayer-pantheon-thumbs}}","replies":[{"poster":"FatedSaviour","date":"2016-12-16T02:59:36.068+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"in my opinion they shouldve removed twisted treeline and put hexakill onto summoners rift, i would actually play that mode if it was on the rift, or even the abyss","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"FatedSaviour","date":"2016-12-16T02:58:04.923+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"when no one votes B XD","replies":[]}]}
