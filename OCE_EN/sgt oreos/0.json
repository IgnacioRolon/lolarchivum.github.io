I sorta feel cheated out of an S that game because I felt like I played very well but getting an A+ for that sort of game just brings my morale super down. I just wanna know how the ranking system works and if there is no curve for supports or a curve for shorter games cause I feel like this is an issue with the ranking system if that is so.","replies":[{"poster":"hðnkƒørÇªmíllè","date":"2016-08-24T13:54:50.546+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"well this aint the ranking system this is the grading system lol. playing meta supports is just generally harder to get S grades, since kills are quite a large factor in grading. Remember the system compares your scores to thousands of other scores of people playing the same champion in the same role. The morganas that got a few more kills and assists woulda got the S rank while your morgana stuck with the A+","replies":[{"poster":"Sloth Almighty","date":"2016-08-25T07:40:53.052+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Very true. I had level 6 blitz for an aeon, could only get S- or below once i got my 6.\n2 support games i had a chance to go full AP, got several kills with my normal death/assist ratio and got x2 S ranks. Then took blitz mid, played passive to late game and scored the rest of my required S to level 7. My mid stats were not vastly impressive, but because i went mid, because i assisted every dragon and baron, S ranks were a shoe-in because my games where compared to mid-blitz games, which im sure are few and far between","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Frag","date":"2016-08-24T09:26:21.683+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It compares your game play (kills/deaths/assists/objectives/etc) with other people that have played Morgana in whatever lane you played...","replies":[]},{"poster":"Sloth Almighty","date":"2016-08-24T04:28:18.696+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"What lane did you play?","replies":[]}]}
