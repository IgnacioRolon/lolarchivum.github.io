That is, if you leave a game, you get a marker, and then you don't play for a month (thus not leaving a game for a month). But the moment you play another game you leave that as well, and get another marker, and trigger the penalty because you've got a high-concentration of 'recent' leaver marks on your account. Ultimately, for it to be considered a 'long while' since you've left a game, you'll have to had played a lot of games where you didn't leave.\n\nI could be wrong, but I believe that's how it works.","replies":[]}]}
