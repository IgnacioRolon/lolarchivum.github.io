Go play another game (I love the Binding of Isaac for it) or another mode (ARAMs are good - less stress than 5s) for awhile.\n- Broaden your champion pool, take on a different role thats easier to climb with if you want. If you're happy with ADC though then stick to what you're good with.\n- Find a duo partner thats on the same page as you, probably a support main if you're an ADC main.\n- If the players (allied or enemy) are getting on your nerves in chat, its sometimes best to /muteall from the beginning before anything else. It will still allow pings through, but it means you'll ignore what people say (Which can be pretty toxic in ranked).","replies":[]},{"poster":"Toiletcleaner143","date":"2019-06-08T11:47:16.257+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I can help you with that if u want","replies":[]}]}
