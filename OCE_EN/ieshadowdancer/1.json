From my climb to plat, it was reasonably quick, but in plat while i have been climbing it has been slower than the rest. I wanna be able to improve my game and pick up on some of my weak points, if theres anyone out there who could possibly help me or be willing to assist me to become a better player, it would be much appreciated, thanks :).","replies":[{"poster":"MyLeftNut","date":"2018-08-04T11:41:37.262+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"I ALSO AM ZOE MAIN AND NEED HELP!","replies":[{"poster":"IEShadowDancer","date":"2018-08-04T12:06:17.336+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I doubt I’m good enough to help you hahah sorry man xD","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"TTL Rem","date":"2018-08-04T07:22:14.843+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Based on your OP.GG, most of your most recent games have been ADC. For someone who is a Mid main, you don't seem to play a lot of Mid. Funnily enough, you have won a good amount of your Mid games. If you want to climb fast, just grab Zoe and 1 or 2 others you like and are good at, and just grind Mid. You seem good enough at Zoe and Mid that you ought to be able to maintain a decent win-rate.\n\nAlso remember you are in the Top ~10% of players (approaching Diamond's Top ~2%). Naturally the climb is going to be slower if you've never been that high before.\n\nIf you want someone to go over your games, I've done that for a Gold III player before, which seemed to work out. I've also played at Plat elo on an alt (now deleted), albeit Jungle.","replies":[{"poster":"IEShadowDancer","date":"2018-08-04T08:13:26.933+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Lol here’s the funny part, I’ve never selected adc as a first pick role ever in this whole season, i always go mid, adc but conveniently enough always get given adc lol. Also I would gladly take up your offer on going over a game sometime, thanks for the reply. Also I play Zoe a lot, but I’m looking for other midlanders to play too, don’t like playing talon","replies":[{"poster":"TTL Rem","date":"2018-08-04T08:52:42.703+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Okies :) Well, based what I've seen in your replays, while you do play a lane bully like Zoe, you're not really utilising the \"bully\" part (at least not well), making me think you have a \"shove and do something\" playstyle. So I would look at champs that have good pushing power and can make good plays around the map, as well as having the burst you like, such as {{champion:163}} , {{champion:136}} (sort of), {{champion:245}} . If you get the \"bully\" part down and packed, then champs like {{champion:134}} and {{champion:69}} would be great for you.\n\nJust my opinion.","replies":[{"poster":"IEShadowDancer","date":"2018-08-04T08:58:58.824+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thanks for the great tips!

So, yes... while Ori suits your playstyle (just with less roaming potential), improving your lane dominance will also help her tremendously. Not to mention she's a lot easier to learn than any of my previous suggestions xD","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"IEShadowDancer","date":"2018-08-04T09:01:55.526+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Also while I do definitely like to push a lot on Zoe, my thinking behind this is mainly to deny cs and have lane priority so I can help my jungler and roam bot if needed. I do as you said need to incorporate more poke into this and try and roam some more aswell maybe. Thanks a lot for the help :).","replies":[{"poster":"TTL Rem","date":"2018-08-04T09:20:02.417+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"That's all well and good, but these are Plats you're facing. They [should] know how to CS pretty consistently under tower. Simply shoving in and backing off (like you're doing) won't really do much, especially since you're also missing last hits.\n\nWhen you do push, make sure you're up in their face and poking them. Either they a) get the CS but eat your damage, b) avoid the damage but miss the CS, or c) trade onto you while you have the minion advantage, so they get chunked AND have AoE/tower shots messing up your minions so that they can't last hit.\n\nNaturally, warding/tracking the enemy Jungler is important for this.\n\nZoe is also the type of champ that is meant to destroy her lane and snowball from that. Roaming may help other lanes, but her main priority would be to bully her opponent and win that lane, before then deciding to roam (of course, good roams are good roams, so it's not a set playstyle).","replies":[{"poster":"IEShadowDancer","date":"2018-08-04T09:24:53.785+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thank you so much for all your help!
