Did you change your OS user-name or your user-name in League? And if League, then was it just your Summoner Name or did you change your user-name (is that even possible?)?\n\nAnyway, I had issues with trying to reinstall League. A quick solution is to find a computer which has League installed on it, and copy and paste all the game files from it over to the computer you want to reinstall on. Might cause version issues, though, so make sure the computer you're copying from has the latest version of League.\n\nIf that's not possible, then try manually setting your DNS. Flush and reset.\n\nThen try setting your IP to static. Some ISPs like to automatically set you some really absurd ones.\n\nIf you need any instructions on how to do any of these, reply to this comment with what you need. Best of luck.","replies":[]}]}
