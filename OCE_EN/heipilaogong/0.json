I&#039;ve submitted a bug report for one of them, but can&#039;t be bothered doing seperate reports for all of them:\r\n\r\n* &#039;disable relative colours&#039; doesn&#039;t work (your team is always blue whether you have it selected or not)\r\n* after spectating a game, you get some error message about performing maintenance\r\n* mega gnar icon in spectate mode is a black box (since release, was briefly fixed but then reverted to this bug again in a later patch)\r\n* some champions (e.g. garen, sivir) move as if they have broken legs in spectator mode\r\n* cannot see all chat in spectator mode anymore\r\n* when kog&#039;maw dies, you cannot click your mouse near his arcathain surprise (passive)\r\n* friends status is often incorrect e.g. says they are in game when they aren&#039;t\r\n\r\nThanks.","replies":[{"poster":"Iloveyoubabygirl","date":"2018-03-29T05:30:51.753+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"essence reaver doesnt return mana on crit moves eg pantheon","replies":[]},{"poster":"Huang Shaotian","date":"2018-03-11T19:28:42.131+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Teemo first blind on gromp doesn't work.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2018-03-11T13:03:05.798+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"If you want to report bugs you should head on over to the Report a Bug board: http://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/bug-report\n\nDon't think that first one is a bug though. Team is always blue to keep readability and consistency, relative colours applies to things like turrets. Relative colours on means red side [owls] will be blue when you're on that side, turned off red side will always be red.","replies":[]}]}
