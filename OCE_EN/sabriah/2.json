Note this was on a Razor mouse, a product that you endorse. Yes he made a mistake that actually hindered his gameplay more than it helped, but permanent suspension for something accidental is rediculous. I will not be playing this game anymore if this matter isn&#039;t resolved, we both love it and have invested thousands of hours and $$ but cannot support this kind of action. Will be looking into legal advice if the matter is not addressed properly as our money investment into this game is high and you are not addressing it with appropriate care. To top it off there is no way to call you to discuss the matter.","replies":[{"poster":"GURNHAWKs","date":"2016-09-30T09:12:50.490+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"http://boards.oce.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/help-support-oce/YQ4IrvNq-morality-poll\n\ncheck this out for fun anyways!","replies":[]},{"poster":"Sabriah","date":"2016-09-23T01:31:24.400+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"They are saying he was 'exploiting' and can't tell us what that means.","replies":[]}]}
