They say that it will effect their investigation methods. The only thing we can think of is he didn&#039;t turn off macros from Ark on his Razor mouse for 3 arams games. If that isn&#039;t the act that resulted in permanent suspension then it is likely his account was hacked. I play the game with him from the same router and cannot see any action he has taken in games that would result in permanent suspension. Can anyone explain whether they think it is the accidental not turning off of macros or it is likely another incident?","replies":[]}
