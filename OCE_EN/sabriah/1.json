Play it a few times of week after work, I like ARAM, I like missions and new gamemodes...I&#039;m a causal adult player. Odyssey however is perhaps the worst gamemode for flaming and missions I&#039;ve ever encountered. I have tried to beat onslaught about 20 times in the last few days and have been flamed, ridiculed and defeated every time because I can&#039;t play 24/7 and am not up to the same missions as everyone else. This is easily the most frustrating game mode  in LOL. Why would you not open pathways to allow those going for the intense missions to battle it out so that those of us who like to play for fun can do so in peace and enjoyment while still being able to complete the event missions.","replies":[{"poster":"Menarche","date":"2018-09-27T11:51:34.622+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"lol game mode has been out for so long sorry my guy.","replies":[]}]}
