This way the whole of OCE doesn&#039;t have to be rounded up into the entirety of one skin. For example, there could be a NZ skin and an AUS skin that players from AUS will choose their respective skin and players from NZ will choose their respective skin.\r\n\r\nI think this could solve a lot of the problems and make it easier. While some people will miss out on getting the other OCE skins due to the one they pick, that&#039;s a risk that I&#039;m sure Riot is going to have to take seeing as it&#039;s hard to make an entire skin for OCE itself. I don&#039;t think it would matter too much people missing out as there&#039;s skins for other regions that people won&#039;t ever get due to not playing on it. While the skin itself isn&#039;t a big problem, I think this will help finally solve the dilemma.","replies":[{"poster":"EuVee","date":"2015-09-03T23:55:32.176+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"There's more to Oceania than Australia and New Zealand.","replies":[{"poster":"HorseDiddle69","date":"2015-09-04T09:32:29.522+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I know, which is why I said \"for example\", mate.","replies":[{"poster":"Torea2","date":"2015-09-05T06:27:37.814+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"This guys obviously austrailan-hes bringing out the \"Mate\"\n\nim from NZ Btw","replies":[]}]}]}]}
