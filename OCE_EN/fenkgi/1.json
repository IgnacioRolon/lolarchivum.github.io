Can riot do anything to help this?","replies":[{"poster":"SephirothSG","date":"2016-09-18T01:47:08.193+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey there,\n\nApologies for such a late response, work and other real life responsibilities have taken much time lately.\n\nCould you run through the [low FPS troubleshooting](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752684-Low-Frame-Rate-FPS-Troubleshooting) guide for me, let me know if anything helps.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Tele","date":"2016-09-17T09:56:52.401+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I recommend you make a new post here detailing your FPS and freezing issues. A Wrenchmen might be able to fix it for you and stop you from AFKing again in the future.\n\nI know you didn't mean to AFK, but it's important to remember that no matter your intentions, you were still AFK and it ruined the game for everyone else involved. \n\n**Riot** can't lift any punishments on this because it's your responsibility to ensure your PC and connection are good enough to play. LeaverBuster will allow for rare disconnects, but if it happens to frequently you'll be punished.\n\nHopefully we can get you back on the rift soon :D","replies":[]}]}
