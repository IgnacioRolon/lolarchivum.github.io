Or even if you report a player so you dont have to play with them again.","replies":[{"poster":"Ing√©nue","date":"2015-01-22T00:07:56.597+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Connection issues were likely caused by a server wide live maintenance. \nRanked is where all the trolling happens. You can still be a successful ADC with a 'support' that takes CS and doesn't ward, it just takes more skill and patience. I believe that blocking a player lessens the likelihood of being paired up with them again, but does not deplete the chance completely due to limited player pool in each skill bracket (I may be wrong).","replies":[]}]}
