After the game, I got punishment and he didn&#039;t. Now I wonder, how you guys define toxic and how the Riot system working ?? Compare between stupid and trash, which one is really toxic? And I swear I didn&#039;t say any other rude words except stupid.","replies":[{"poster":"SOOM","date":"2018-02-14T18:24:41.698+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"Soz bro but that’s classificed as toxic.... how would you feel if someone called you stupid in game...","replies":[{"poster":"hahahahaha1","date":"2018-02-14T18:54:02.302+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"A behavior or a person can be stupid, stupid is a word to say when people do something without thinking, your friend or your parents can say this is a stupid think a stupid behavior but they will never say you are a trash, now you feel difference?","replies":[{"poster":"ThatsBS","date":"2018-02-14T21:55:39.102+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Lol, you realise that both words are offensive. Calling someone stupid for what ever they do shouldnt be toerated as it does nothing to help your team, it just makes the individual feel bad. Do you honestly think it will make him/her play better? \n\nAlso you stated you didnt blame anyone, but you said the jungle is bad and stupid.  To me that is blaming someone. Also was the top opposition guy calling you trash because you were blaming your jungle? \n\nAs what has always been stated on the boards with regards to this blaming others factor... its best not to as it creates arguments over chat which leads to little or no focus on game play. Giving the advantage to the opposition... Think about it.. \n\nJust be kind... no point in making the situation worse by blaming someone else....","replies":[]},{"poster":"SOOM","date":"2018-02-14T21:50:23.878+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"You don’t have to say it dude..\nNow let me show you the official definition ... “having or showing a great lack of intelligence or common sense.” \n\n^thats what u called ur team mate hence toxic","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Exarch Leona","date":"2018-02-15T05:33:37.924+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":2,"body":"Literally anything and everything remotely negative is seen as toxic here.\nEven giving people tips to win is seen as toxic because \"MUH NEGATIVITY\"\n\nBUT\nFor some reaasons, quoting people here\nAFKing/Int feeding/flaming/being a crappy person isn't seen as toxic player behaviour.","replies":[]},{"poster":"TM06ASF","date":"2018-02-16T00:32:50.393+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"lol roit thinks thy can get rid of toxicity when their game breeds it its a by product of what they have created its a team based game and if one %%%% fucks up it affects the other 4 people  but don't ban obv feeders or people who try to incite this lol","replies":[{"poster":"esp","date":"2018-02-16T11:35:59.517+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=TM06ASF,realm=OCE,application-id=T8eq2lFQ,discussion-id=oIzy7Myb,comment-id=0003,timestamp=2018-02-16T00:32:50.393+0000)\n>\n> lol roit thinks thy can get rid of toxicity when their game breeds it its a by product of what they have created its a team based game and if one %%%% fucks up it affects the other 4 people  but don&#x27;t ban obv feeders or people who try to incite this lol\n\nGlad you understand the system and how dumb riot is, not enough people like u on forums.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Lemøngraß","date":"2018-02-15T03:17:25.610+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"There is competative banter, and then there is telling someone to kill themselves, or that their mother should have swallowed blah blah blah, 6 years of playing and its always been the same, just mute them all lol","replies":[]},{"poster":"LevvyLeviticus","date":"2018-02-17T00:23:06.026+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"okay, telling somebody to kill themselves is a definite no-go zone, it's not good to say to anyone because you don't know what their life is like. racial slurs and homophobic slurs are also a no-go zone, because they are highly offensive and can really hurt someone.
