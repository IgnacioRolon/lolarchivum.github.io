After closing my league client and attempting to re-open it, it crashed again. Again i rebooted my client and I managed to get into the load screen and then told me it couldn&#039;t connect, so i closed it and decided to reboot my computer to see if that worked, by then the game had finished. I was wondering what on earth could be causing this?","replies":[]}
