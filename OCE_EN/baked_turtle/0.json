I feel like I've tried everything, but I keep weighing myself down. My champion of choice at the moment is Riven, and I've managed to have a couple of good games, which have got me to my promos to Bronze 4. I'm not one to complain about teammates, since each person is ranked individually. I just want to know some basic tips in which I can improve my game, especially my late game and teamfighting. I can easily go 2-0 up in the laning phase, but how do I transfer that over to the late games? Thanks in advance","replies":[{"poster":"iNoob","date":"2015-01-05T08:46:17.590+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"1. Stick to a champion which is highly versatile, isn't 100% pick/ban, and is early to mid game oriented (See Riven) I say she is versatile because she can go Top/Mid/Jungle with succession. \n\n2. Try to only play that 1 champion, don't go off thinking \"oh this champion looks op, I bet I could get easier wins with it\" while playing heaps of that champion I recommend looking at guides/watching high elo Riven players such as BRNA and BoxBox.\n\n3. Learn to cs, freeze the wave in your favor, ward up, map awareness, shot calling, calculating plays (when I say calculating I mean factoring in your potential damage + ignite and their health, would it be enough) \n\nManipulate minion health, sometimes the tower will 1 shot the creep because it has too little health (if this is the case you try burst it or prepare future minions so you can farm them under the tower)\n\nShot calling: if bot lane just got a double kill and they have 80% health + mana you want to tell them to do Dragon with the jungler, if their jungler shows up your main task is to zone him, if he goes in for smite steal cc him and keep him out of range. \n\nUnderstanding all the champions (if you develop an understanding of every champion in the game and how they function you will be able to make more plays, this includes cooldown of abilities etc)\n\nP.S. (it is ok if they fall off a bit late because if you have mastered a versatile champion such as Riven you are still going to be a factor late)","replies":[]},{"poster":"RonyStark","date":"2015-01-06T02:10:07.913+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"1.

CS can win matchups alone, giving you gold for bigger and better items, earlier than kills ever can. Prioritize farming over poking and etc. Go for last hits over an auto attack on an enemy. Obviously, if an enemy is overextending, punish that fool, but don't go to extreme lengths.","replies":[{"poster":"JasonWazza","date":"2015-01-06T01:41:31.834+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> earlier than kills ever can.\n\nUmm unless your like 8-0 and the guy is now worth cannon minion gold, kills still earn more gold then CS and can snowball you faster (which is why a high kill lane is usually miles ahead of a farm lane)","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"hðnkƒørÇªmíllè","date":"2015-01-05T08:10:13.624+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"If this is in fact a sincere request, my advice would be:\n\n- Play easier, less skill requiring champs.\nI don't know your skill on riven, you could be an amazing riven player, but still I think it is better to play less skill champs, that can carry easier with. If you love playing riven continue to play riven then of course, but find easy champs to play in lower elo's. \ne.g. I played Adc a lot to get higher divisions. I played Tristana, a pretty easy champ for my skill level, instead of say Vayne, someone who requires a bit of skill and mechanics to play to her at her \"highest\" effectiveness.\n\nChampions Like Akali are amazing for lower elo's. insane potential, not much skill required to be effective\n\nBut yeah dude stick to easy champs, Riven is a little more advanced but if you're good with her by all means continue playing her :)","replies":[]}]}
