Let's be honest, they don't matter as much and the bots AFK too. Yeah, it sucks, but it is not competitive play which puts people at a disadvantage. It should be a lot harder to get penalties in bot games.","replies":[{"poster":"Klavinmour","date":"2015-01-03T06:55:30.079+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Summoner's Code applies to all games, hell if you use scripts or glitch abuse in a custom game you will still be permabanned for that.

I see the point of what you are saying though, because someone who leaves somewhere is likely to leave somewhere else as well.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Klavinmour","date":"2015-01-03T06:57:25.020+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You deliberately left a game for a reason you should already have been aware of.

Even though one team says they're okay with it, it is a bad habit to get into.\n\nAlso, if you're leaving games because of internet problems, you should look into fixing that because that is more than enough reason to get you into trouble from the system.","replies":[]}]}
