It's slightly more convenient for the player because they don't have to think before using it like other champs would, but unlike Malphite it doesn't actually contribute to what makes his kit work. \nAll champions should have ways to be played around, and adding in _'unstoppable-ness'_ into a game which revolves around counterplay is a risky move. So I don't think it should be applied to things lightly. \nMalphite needs it, Vi needs it, both have it on their ults so it has a long cooldown and is only used in certain situations. But Ornn has it on a basic ability, and a basically ability that is not only spammable, but already has so much utility, not only that, but it doesnt actually contribute to the main overall function of his kit anyway. So I think its loss would be fair enough.\n\nAgreed it'll be a shame to lose the quick-thinking plays where you see a Riven about to land her knockup, or a Yasuo tornado heading for your face, and you can activate W to counter it.\nBut the thing is, he's a tank. and a VERY tanky tank. He shouldn't be afraid of CC, and giving him a way to block CC is a little unnecessary. Such CC blocking abilities are best left to champs like Sivir who should be terrified of CC and can make full use of those extra milliseconds blocking it gives her.\n\n________________\n\nAlso im 100% with you about Ornn's ult not being blocked by the windwall.\nBy any definition it can **not** be classified as a 'projectile'. It's a living breaking creature that moves through its own self-propulsion. \nIt's a farce that the windfall stops it!\n\nIt's easy enough to avoid the first charge, and if you do so, the second is no where near as devastating. Not to mention he has to actively aim both, AND position himself for the 2nd, also CC prevents him from activating the 2nd dash. Thats more than enough counterplay for the ability in my books.","replies":[{"poster":"JasonWazza","date":"2018-01-20T12:04:43.124+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":">Agreed it'll be a shame to lose the quick-thinking plays where you see a Riven about to land her knockup, or a Yasuo tornado heading for your face, and you can activate W to counter it.\nBut the thing is, he's a tank. and a VERY tanky tank.
