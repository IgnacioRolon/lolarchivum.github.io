If they are too deep in resentment, you're not gonna magically make a rallying cry and band together in the name of victory. \n\nAll you'll have is a cesspool of angry people being stuck in a match, all the while scrutinising each others untill the enemy team land the final nail. The FF option reduce that exprience to a minimum. \n\nYour ideal version of working with those people, that've already decided to FF AFK; Is most feasible when their personality allow them to look pass the frustrations and aim for the desired end results. You can pulled them back with kind words or make plays that bring them hope. But. If some 1 else on your team dont \"words \"cuddle them, instead fan the flame? Forget it. There are so many factors that can go up against you in dealing with the above situation. \n\nIf you think people saying FF15 is bad/annoying, then imagine how bad things can get if FF is removed. They will be ban, or you will be ban.

A lot of trolls thrive off reactions.\"\n\nIf you mute them, they will simply act it out ingame. Which usually degraded down to feeding, intentionally getting caught, or afk farm; Mind you, that these just are some of the examples.\n\nThe mute option is not an effective method to counteract hate. Lets be honest. How would you feel if someone just mute you while you are angry? A simple reaction would be. \"Ahh, ok! You want to say your peace then mute me before i can get my return? Screw the game, ill make your time ingame as miserable as i can manage.\"\n\nIt all come down to the depth of animosity they bear toward the player/players they hate. Take the bronze ranks population for example. Once the match starting to shown signs of degeneration; It cascade down fast. Why do you think bronze players says low elo behaviours are the worst? There is truth to it you know. You can only talk sense to those who still want to win. But once they've decided the game is not as enjoyable as seing the person they hate lose. There is nothing you can do.\n\nIf they are a minority; There would be a less show of hands, from players claiming their 'toxic' team mate is holding down their rise to prominent high. The data and examples of toxic ingame behaviors, outnumbered cases of FF ever being a problem. \n\nRemove FF and you will increase the durations where players have to sit through it. Mute does NOT work. Verbal is but 1 path to hateful execution.","replies":[{"poster":"gkrit","date":"2018-08-01T04:55:55.216+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"A toxic player has little to hate if no one responds to them. There's also a difference between a \"toxic player\" and a \"troll\".\n\nYou really have no chance of reasoning with a Troll and they were always intending on making a miserable experience. Whereas toxic generally don't intend on making a negative experience but have such a short fuse that small things can make them explode (which can be due to a number of things such as a loss streak). Just talking to them can fuel the fire and trigger toxic players, so if there is no response to this sort of behavior their focus will shift back towards the game rather than focusing on abusing people. \n\nThere's obviously exceptions to the rule but toxic people ALWAYS look for an easy out. Don't give them the option and don't fuel their fire and you'll most likely see them commit a little more to the game.","replies":[{"poster":"TheDemonEmperor","date":"2018-08-01T08:13:43.556+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Giving toxic players the silient treatment; Is the same as telling them, nothing they says have values.

When a conflict turn toxic. Ha! Misery is all that matters. You are asking people to follow an ideal that is hard to apply.\n\nI can say awful stuffs to you right now; And i doubt you will be happy with just a mute.

Because it's \"easier\".\nRemove the elevator from the equation. \nYou still need to get to floor 15 (for whatever reason you desire). What do you do? Obviously use the stairs as it's the only option and you know no better. Sure, you may not really like the idea but you do it anyway.\n\nThat example doesn't explain everything we've discussed but it's why I believe if you give people an \"easier\" option, they will be more inclined to take it just because less effort needs to be invested. \n\nGive them the tools and they will use them.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"00shots00","date":"2018-07-27T10:46:05.802+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"i agree with you","replies":[]},{"poster":"Örnn Bot","date":"2018-07-23T17:58:52.416+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"***","replies":[{"poster":"gkrit","date":"2018-07-24T01:44:04.079+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"If your read what i said carefully u would have noticed i said \"in MOST cases\".\n\nMajority of the time you get people calling ff15 at 7 mins and in this case I'm being held hostage till 15 to 20 mins... are you kidding me???\nThe reason why people call FF so often is because they've been given a specific time where they can surrender and then people think they can save time (for what... 5-10 mins?) to move to next game.
