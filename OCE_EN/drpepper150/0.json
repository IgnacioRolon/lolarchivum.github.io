Did something happen to the servers. I did get my internet upgraded last week to VDSL but that makes no sense that it would increase my ping. My download speed and upload speed have tripled due to the upgrade but my ping has increase? I don&#039;t know much about networking so maybe VDSL has problems with servers or something lol i dunno. Anyone got any inquiries to why this is or did the servers change location like with the NA servers. There is a link to a speed test before the upgrade, I got like 3 down and 1 up. So there is a significant change with the upgrade. I am planning on upgrading to fibre when it comes to my street so maybe then it will go back down.","replies":[{"poster":"Wuks","date":"2015-12-20T13:45:18.817+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey DrPepper150,\n\nI'm sorry to hear that you're encountering connection issues to the League of Legends servers.
