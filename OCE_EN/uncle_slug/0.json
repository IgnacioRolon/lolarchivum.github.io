It&#039;s not related to traffic because i can still download other things at full speed (over 1MByte/s) no problems. Anyway after doing some digging it seems patch files are hosted/cached by the same people as EA&#039;s Origin - Akamai, and people using origin also experience slow downloads.

It feels so out of your control you just want to punch some shmuck in the face.\n\nFor the moment I suggest experimenting with different DNS's. Probably won't do anything but if you're out of ideas, may as well try.\n\nDo you have some other way of connecting to the internet to compare your connection, eg. smartphone wifi hotspot?","replies":[]}]}]}]}
