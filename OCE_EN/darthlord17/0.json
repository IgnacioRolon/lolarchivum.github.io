Recently, I wanted to change a different email account that is currently linked to my league account as I do not use that email that often. Hence when I wanted to do so, the league website required me to enter a verification code that was sent to the email account. The trouble that I am having right now is that I had deleted the email account before switching the league account to a new email account. Hence I am unable to retrieve the code from the deleted email account. Is there any way that I can change my email account without entering any code ? I remembered that we were allowed to switch the linked email as long as we were logged in without entering any code. I feel insecure having my league account linked to an unaccesible email.  Please help me thank you. \r\n\r\nNote : the email account can no longer be recovered as it had passed the 14 day period.","replies":[{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2018-08-05T06:04:07.519+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Submit a ticket to player support.
