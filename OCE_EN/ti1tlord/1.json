They start to find match at the same time with one player solo queue and other two duo. If they are matched in the same team then it is fine, it is tri-queue. But if they are not in the same side, then it is fxxking terrible. The player who is soloing will int-feed. And when he is not worth gold anymore, one of other two who are from duo will let the solo one kill him, so the solo one would worth gold again. So only one player get lost and other two win. After one game, they will swap. The people who lost in the last game will duo with another, one player from duo will do the solo queue. Basicly, A int-feed, B and C get LP; then B int-feed, A and C get LP; then C int-feed, A and B get LP. They are running this cycle when they are playing together. Due to swapping, they will always keep in the same mmr and keep getting higher division. I have the screenshoots of some evidences. Check the link below.
