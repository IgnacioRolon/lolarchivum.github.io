Clutching at her cloth facemask Taliyah scoured the haze of sand for some form of shelter. Sandstorms were a common occurrence in the Shuriman lands especially closer towards the desert&rsquo;s heart. With her legs aching however, sandstorms could prove to be a real danger. Kneeling, Taliyah reached to the barren rock beneath her. Pulsing waves of energy rushed through her as she felt the familiar buzz of her magic&rsquo;s work. Within minutes a small barrier of stone was formed around her &ndash; a humble shelter to be certain, but one that would provide much needed respite from the winds. \n\nShuriman sandstorms could last up to hours; Taliyah&rsquo;s upbringing had taught her that much. It was better to catch sleep when possible; she had many more days to travel after all. Taliyah&rsquo;s mind flickered through her recent worries. She had heard the rumours of Sun Discs rising once again, murmurings of a great empire rebuilt. The nomads she had spoken to yesterday were thrilled with the news, Taliyah was not so na&iuml;ve. Finding warmth in the memories of her family, Taliyah drifted off into sleep.\n\n&ldquo;Help.&rdquo;\n\nTaliyah stirred. The howling winds showed no signs of easing off. Brushing off a thin layer of dust Taliyah listened for the source of the noise. There it was again! A faint cry - almost drowned out by the desert. Taliyah rose to stand, legs protesting at her efforts. Pulling her facemask up to her nose Taliyah once again entered the maelstrom. She didn&rsquo;t relish the thought of walking through the sandstorm, though being lost in one was a far worse fate. Hunting the distant cries, Taliyah slid down the sand dunes.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------- ACT II ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nTaliyah found source of the sound after twenty minutes of searching. A combination of listening, weaver&rsquo;s magic and desert intuition led Taliyah to a gaping rift in the earth. The surrounding dunes filled into a natural basin of sand. At the heart of the sink was a chasm which hungrily ate the falling sand like some variety of Shuriman dune rat. Taliyah&rsquo;s heart leaped. At the edge of the basin, clutching at some fallen boulders was a young girl. Though sand sinks weren&rsquo;t too uncommon, they posed a significant risk to travellers in the sandstorms. One false step could see even the most well versed traveller slipping to a horrid death - drowning under the scorched sand.\n\nReaching to the stone beneath her, Taliyah began to draw out her magic. The rush of power filled her with the desert&rsquo;s warmth, flooding her veins with untapped power. No, this was far too risky. Taliyah had made mistakes relying on magic before, who knew what trouble it could cause this time. Hesitantly, she reversed the flow of her magic until it had returned to the stones she knelt on.\n\nAnother cry for help jolted Taliyah out of her daze. The young girl was having difficulty clinging to the rocks, torrents of sand tried to heave her from her shelter, bringing her closer to the ever hungry maw of earth. Fumbling with her coiled rope, Taliyah began tying it around a firm jut of earth. \n&ldquo;It&rsquo;ll be okay,&rdquo; Taliyah called in an effort to reassure the girl. \n\nHearing noise, the girl waved her arms in recognition. Taliyah began her descent, sliding into the sand sink&rsquo;s maw while clinging to her rope. After a minute of careful treading, Taliyah came to a stop beside the child. She was a young girl, around ten or eleven. Her reddened cheeks hinted at an upbringing under the Shuriman sun. Taliyah brought her hands to cup the child&rsquo;s tear stained face.\n\n&ldquo;Take hold of me and this rope and don&rsquo;t let go,&rdquo; Taliyah murmured.\n\nThe girl shook for a few moments before nodding. Unsteadily she clambered into Taliyah&rsquo;s grasp. Taliyah waited a few moments for the girl to steady before she began heaving her way up the sand dune. The oncoming sand buffeted the pair, threatening to see them slip into oblivion. With steady steps Taliyah struggled against the tide of sand, the grains slipped past her facemask, Taliyah clamped her eyes and jaw shut so as to avoid a mouthful of sand. After what felt like forever, Taliyah collapsed at the top of the sand dune. \n\nThe girl was safe, still huddled into her ragged cloth garments. Taliyah sighed in relief, mustering what energy she had left into forming a thin barrier of rock. Exhaust, battered and spent, Taliyah passed out on her bed of stone.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------- ACT III ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nHer limbs ached. All Taliyah could bear to do was open her eyes. The sun was out, peering around the corners of her hasty shelter. There was a warm smell, food! Taliyah jolted upright, regretting it immediately as her legs and arms ached in agony. The young girl had already set about serving some of Taliyah&rsquo;s rations. The girl&rsquo;s warm smile and humming reminded Taliyah of the days when she would watch her mother cook. Pushing nostalgia aside, Taliyah made her way beside the child, gratefully taking a bowl before eating in silence.\n\n&ldquo;Thank you, for saving me.&rdquo; The young girl stammered. Taliyah grinned in response, continuing to scoff down her food.  \n\n&ldquo;I&rsquo;m headed to The Oasis of the Dawn, if that&rsquo;s the way you&rsquo;re travelling I&rsquo;d be happy to have you by my side.&rdquo; Taliyah replied.\n\nThe girl beamed and nodded enthusiastically before turning to her food. Taliyah munched thoughtfully. Honestly she didn&rsquo;t know what Shurima would have in store for her, but the thought of reuniting with her family was one that pushed any form of doubt aside.\n\n&ldquo;I wonder what a Sun Disc looks like.&rdquo; Taliyah murmured. The young girl continued to eat, seemingly oblivious to Taliyah&rsquo;s words.","replies":[{"poster":"Oneechan","date":"2016-07-10T09:44:49.188+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I love the play-like feel of the story.
