If you are experiencing severe interruptions during play, then you are suggested to do something to prevent those interruptions or to only play when you know you won't be interrupted.\n\nSince the electricity cutting out isn't really something you have any control over, then your best option is to play from an uninterruptable power source, such as battery or fuel. Then that depends on how much money you'd be willing to spend on such things, just to not get any more penalties.","replies":[]}]}
