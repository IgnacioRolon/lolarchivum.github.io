I immediately checked my match history and there was nothing there on the client, also all of my champions/skins were gone. So I came on this site and checked my match history of my Character and my games from last night are still there but when I search up my name on the client it just shows me the level 1 profile. Any help/fixes would be deeply appreciated, I have spent easily $600+ on this game and i&#039;mquite worried/angry. Hard getting money as a student.\r\n\r\nThanks in advance!","replies":[{"poster":"SephirothSG","date":"2016-05-01T09:03:51.632+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey there,\n\nFrom what I can tell you have a level 1 account on NA, it's possible you logged into this account by mistake.\n\nPlease open your launcher and make sure your client is set to OCE.","replies":[]}]}
