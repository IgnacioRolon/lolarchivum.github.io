Disappointing especially considering the skins on sale and the snowdown ones are bad imo. \r\n\r\nLink for evidence:\r\nhttps://i.gyazo.com/1384f05062c864fd8c2215f1dc98c8a5.png","replies":[{"poster":"Wuks","date":"2015-12-18T00:40:31.823+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey Dannerz,\n\nI apologize for the misunderstanding in the dates provided regarding the self-Mystery Gifting event.
