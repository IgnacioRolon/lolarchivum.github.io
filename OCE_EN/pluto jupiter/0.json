I had to wait to get a server transfer until they were available again. I noticed while my account was on the US I had a mission for the first game played with new runes would give me like 400,000 essence. I was like &quot;Oh that&#039;d be sweet, but I want to wait to do that until my ping isn&#039;t 300.&quot; So I waited until and transferred... Now that I&#039;m transferred that mission doesn&#039;t exist. And I&#039;ve played a couple of games with the new runes and the mission still doesn&#039;t exist. Normally I wouldn&#039;t care, but that&#039;s a lot of essence to miss out on just because I swapped servers. I waited a long time to change servers and I feel like I&#039;m constantly getting kicked while I&#039;m down... :(","replies":[{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2018-02-01T07:56:33.014+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"It was announced with the changes that the mission wouldn't transfer so complete it first if you want to transfer servers. That said if you haven't played in awhile it's likely you missed that. The best you can do is submit a ticket to support explaining your situation and they might give you the blue essence. That said I don't want to get your hopes up, they have every right to say no, and may well.\n\nhttps://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/requests/new","replies":[{"poster":"Pluto Jupiter","date":"2018-02-01T08:12:25.540+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Oh, yeah I didn't read about that...
