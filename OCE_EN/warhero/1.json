Its the same with low MMR pvp games, no1 knows how to jungle, everyone just lanes and takes super huge risks against the other player as they are used to playing against a bot who at low hp will try to run away instead of landing that last spell or move that will kill you.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Daejel","date":"2014-12-15T10:11:01.825+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"When I play on my smurf I just play anywhere I'm needed and don't try too hard.

This looks a lot like bait.\n\nWhat happens when a team of five players all with your mind set decide they all want to top and lock in before declaring that they are all going to go top? 'Instalocking' is a selfish behaviour. The only time instalocking is even remotely acceptable is if you're comfortable filling any role with the champ you've chosen.\n\nA toddler tries to take what they want with no regard to others and cry when they don't get it. Mature adults will bargain, reason, and come to a compromise for the best possible outcome *for all players*, not just themselves.\n\nThere are too many toddlers in this game. You're not entitled to anything more than the rest of your team.\n\nYou're right though. People can't tell you what to do. We all need to be mature adults by our own sheer willpower.\n\nWhat the ♥♥♥♥ is smarf.","replies":[{"poster":"GangOne","date":"2014-12-15T05:58:32.090+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Jakiron,realm=OCE,application-id=Ntey9fRZ,discussion-id=63AEi10b,comment-id=00030000,timestamp=2014-12-15T03:10:13.341+0000)\n> Is this bait.
