Me and someone else have been practicing our shoutcasting for local tournaments and are looking to obtain more experience. We have consistently been getting very good reviews as we have very good synergy between us as a play by play caster and a color caster. So yeah, if any one is hosting a tournament and needs a pair of shoutcasters would be more then willing to help!\r\n\r\nMuch appreciated!\r\nTalkwyn","replies":[{"poster":"SpawnTheCaster","date":"2016-08-19T02:46:33.108+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey Talkwyn,\n\nSpawn here, one of the shoutcasters from the Riot Syd office.

We don't currently have anything right now. We were thinking of starting up a YouTube channel with some of our casts, but was wondering if it would be well received.
