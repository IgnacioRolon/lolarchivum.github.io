It&#039;s my turn to ban a champ.\r\n\r\nI click ZED, a black border is highlighted around ZED&#039;s portrait - however, the BAN button doesn&#039;t highlight.\r\n\r\nI click on other champs, the same thing - border highlighted, but BAN button doesn&#039;t highlight.\r\n\r\nThis game has so many bugs it&#039;s frustrating, especially for someone like myself who can only play 1 game every few days.\r\n\r\nI received a 30 min queue ban because I apparently &quot;abandoned a game during champion selection&quot; which is F*kn Bull*hit.\r\n\r\nDoes anyone from Riot look into issues like this, or do you  not give a flaming hoot?","replies":[{"poster":"SephirothSG","date":"2016-02-15T10:00:52.560+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey there,\n\nCould you try the following and let me know if anything helps.\n\n* [Repair your client](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201761974-Bug-Splat-and-Game-Crashes#wq6)\n* [Reset Windows internet options](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/202536660-Issues-with-the-League-of-Legends-Store-PvP-Net-#wq3)\n* [Switch to a public DNS](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201761944#wq111)","replies":[]}]}
