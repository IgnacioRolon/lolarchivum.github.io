The cooldown of his ult is also a lot lower.\n\nOnly 6 marksman were actually changed dramatically. Doesn't mean there are only 6 marksman in the game.\n\nPretty sure every ADC was tweaked in some way.\n\nhttp://www.surrenderat20.net/p/current-pbe-balance-changes.html#champs\n\n-----------------------------------------------------\n\nWhy some marksman only had smaller changes (by Riot Repertoir): http://boards.pbe.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/champions-gameplay-feedback/N7VZrAws-smaller-522-marksmen-changes-pbe-feedback-thread\n\n>**Twitch:** There seemed to be some concern that Twitch would get meaningfully weaker with his updates on the PBE, and that's certainly not the intention here. We're pretty confident that his added Q reset allows him much more of the assassination pattern stuff that makes him so unique. If this isn't enough to do it, we'll want to follow up with ways to make that more a reality, whether that be instant fade on the reset, improved burst from stealth, or some other way to make him feel even more like the top notch marksman assassin.","replies":[]}]}
