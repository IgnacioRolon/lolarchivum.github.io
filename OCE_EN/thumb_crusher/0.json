This would force people who use attack move to kite to train better without just right clicking every where when they are tired.\r\n\r\nRiot is there any chance this button could be added?","replies":[{"poster":"ROGU3","date":"2017-02-06T06:32:36.724+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I barely understand what you're trying to say dude...\n\nif you want to move towards an enemy, you can click the ground in front or behind them.\nPeople who use attack move, use it to kite better? That's the reason I use it? What do you mean 'without just right clicking everywhere'?\nWhat would the button do, exactly? You'd press this button to be able to walk on top of people?","replies":[{"poster":"Orange Caramel","date":"2017-02-26T11:14:00.347+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"He wants to be forced to use attack move or else he can't hit the enemy.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2017-02-06T09:03:54.769+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"There is one, by default it is `. If you hold it down and click you will move without attacking.\n\nBut it sounds like you want attack move removed? It's a mechanic of the game that you have to learn how to use, I don't see how it's a problem.","replies":[{"poster":"Thumb Crusher","date":"2017-02-25T15:47:33.843+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hi, \n\nI use tab as attack move. When I practice for adc I want to be able to make sure I use attack move and not just click on the enemy. Because I forget to use attack move and just right click on enemy to attack them. But If right click didn't attack it would force me to use tab the attack move button and become better at kiting.\n\nIts more to make sure I use attack move and don't forget to use it when Im tired.","replies":[]}]}]}
