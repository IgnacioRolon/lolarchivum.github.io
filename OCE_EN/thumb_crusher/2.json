How good synergy will Yuumi and Zoe have? Think of Yuumi with ignite and exhaust. In a duo lane you could ignite and exhaust both opponents + have another 2 summoners such as heal, barrier or flash ready. If yuumi takes Item CDR runes and Hextech GLP you have 2 charges of it every 20 seconds!!! So 10 sec CD on H GLP as an average. They both scale from AP so will get strong benefit from partnering from each other. If Zoe takes lich bane she can R-Auto and Yuumi Q for about 150AP scaling with little risk of return damage.\r\n\r\nToo make up for no marksmen Twitch can jungle. Is Yuumi still camoflage when she attached to camoflage? Because Yuumi ult of no where combined with Twitch R is super scary!!!\r\nWhy not have Shen in the Top Lane to provide some protection for these squishees. He can ult the camoflage twitch for a completely devastating gank. And a beefy midlaner too such as a Swain or even a fighter mid with CC.\r\n\r\nWhat you guys think? Can people please test this combo out and see how it goes?","replies":[{"poster":"Daymon","date":"2019-06-14T07:22:30.193+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"good combo, anything slipperly with jumps, disengages and hard to catch is great for yuumi for obvious reasons, kalista, jinx, kaisa\nthe ultimate apc yuumi lane would zilean IF you could cast time in a bottle (xp bang) on urself. zilean needs that buff bad.. would make him break even in terms of threshold break even interest rates of runnning him comparative to other net present value options!!!!!!!!","replies":[]}]}
