Would be awesome if there was one super utility item for seiges. It could have different functions for where you click.\r\n\r\nTerrain: Zz'rot Portal Emerge\r\nEnemy Tower: Ohmwrecker Passive\r\nAlly: There next auto does 500 true damage to tower or inhib.\r\nAlly Tower: Makes tower invulnerable for 2.5s.\r\nEnemy in Ally Tower Range: Draws tower agro and a machine gun of 3 bullets fires from tower.\r\n\r\nThis would be a great seige item for utility supports. One of my main hates as a support is not being able to take down towers or defend towers.","replies":[{"poster":"Daymon","date":"2019-06-14T04:26:46.999+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"its good how it is. ohm wreckers a specialty unit for premade games you wont see the calibre of publically demonstrated and zzrot is just great as is all round. if it aint broke dont fix it ull just break it and thats ur chance","replies":[]}]}
