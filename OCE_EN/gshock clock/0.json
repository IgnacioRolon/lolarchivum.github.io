I don&#039;t care that I cannot play the game no more, fine (be it banned/hacked/whatever {{summoner:11}} {{item:3133}} ) but I have put numerous amounts of money into this game (easily $1000+) and that has all been taken away from me. Riot can easily offer a password reset and try to fix it but even if the account has been seized and can no longer be accessed no form of payment/refund is offered to the person. A lot of high profile players get away with it, accounts either returned or not but they have the money to not give a care in the world. So this is me telling all players to not spend a cent on this game, it is essentially free to play and if your account gets hit, cya later to all &quot;your&quot; hard earned money. {{item:3151}}","replies":[{"poster":"Project Xayah","date":"2017-08-09T01:39:10.319+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"I would like to just point out that, once you spend money on RP, it is no longer \"your\" hard earned money, but rather Riot's. That said, it is stated in the [ToU](http://oce.leagueoflegends.com/en/legal/termsofuse) and [EULA](http://oce.leagueoflegends.com/en/legal/eula) that you can't get a refund, except where applicable Law would say otherwise. In order for the applicable Law to take effect, there'd need to be some form of \"False Advertising\", \"Failure to follow through\" (on Riot's part), \"Giving an incorrect amount\" (such as if you payed for 2000RP, but only got 1000RP) or something like that, so I doubt that would apply in this scenario.\n\nHere's the exert from the ToU regarding refunds:\n> **Section 4.3** *Do I “own” the Virtual Items I unlock?*\n> You have no ownership or other property interest in any of the Virtual Items you unlock, regardless of whether you acquired access to those Virtual Items using Riot Points, Influence Points or Hextech Crafting. Virtual Items have no monetary value. You can’t redeem them for cash. You can’t obtain any refunds for purchasing Riot Points or Virtual Items, except to the extent (if any) required for Australian consumers by the ACL.\n\nQuite simply, it's well within their rights to refuse refunds, so long as they're doing the right thing in a legal sense (no different than if you were talking about any business).\n\nAs for not having access to your account (and it seems you are unsure why that is?), you should try submitting a ticket to [Support](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us), and/or going through the [account recovery processes](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/requests/new) (follow the link, select \"I need help recovering my account\" and fill out the form as best you can). You should, at least, be able to get an answer as to why you're not able to access your account (from my knowledge, a ban would not prevent you from logging in, just from playing [I may be wrong, though]).","replies":[]},{"poster":"Roguestoney","date":"2017-08-08T23:12:38.753+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"You accepted these conditions.

If you're still interested in playing, that is. Any money that you spend on accounts in non-refundable, as in the terms of use, you shouldn't expect to get it back. Just submit an account recovery ticket and answer the questions that Riot gives you, and you should have no dramas playing again.","replies":[]}]}
