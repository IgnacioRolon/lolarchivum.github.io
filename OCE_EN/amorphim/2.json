The thing is that not all scripters are _good_. Some are godawful and others are just as bad. The thing is that most scripters are mechanically gifted, due to the scripts, but had godawful l decision making.","replies":[{"poster":"Nijel","date":"2016-10-29T07:59:45.563+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Third Reich,realm=OCE,application-id=FjGAIbRv,discussion-id=9NEGhd80,comment-id=00020000,timestamp=2016-10-29T07:06:48.670+0000)\n>\n> Why?

To me, and many others, that feels good. Even if it was just dumb luck, the fact you made someone so mad they've accused you of cheating is very flattering in its own, unusual way. While I realise from the side it can appear more of an insult, the mainly negative connotations of the word \"scripter\" are rarely interpreted by the falsely accused player (who's probably havin' a chuckle).","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Fitzky","date":"2016-10-25T05:06:34.681+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"What I said?","replies":[]},{"poster":"Talon12","date":"2016-10-25T04:48:06.044+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"what he said ^","replies":[]},{"poster":"The Wanak King","date":"2016-10-25T00:09:54.769+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°),( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°),( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°),( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°),( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°),( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°),( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°),( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°),( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°),( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°),( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°),( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°),( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°),( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°),( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°),( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°),( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°),( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°),( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°),( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°),( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°),( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°),( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°),( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°),( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°),( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°),( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°),( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°),( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°),","replies":[]},{"poster":"Roguestoney","date":"2016-10-24T23:14:10.897+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Filthy scripter ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)","replies":[]}]}
