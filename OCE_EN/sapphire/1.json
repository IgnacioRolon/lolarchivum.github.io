Constantly Disconnecting From PVP.net","subforum":"Help & Support (OCE)","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Every ten or so seconds my client will disconnect from PVP.net and occasionally the client will crash completely. I have no issues whatsoever if I do happen to make it into a game, which is rare. I&#039;ve had this issue for a few months now &amp; I&#039;ve tried disabling IP Helper, repairing client, disabling Firewall, etc. &amp; it has gotten to the point where I can&#039;t play games at all because it is becoming progressively worse. Does anybody have a solution?","replies":[{"poster":"Mindstar","date":"2015-07-13T01:56:56.348+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hi,\n\nWhat ISP are you with?
