I began to play another  few games, being nothing but positive and only talking to communicate, and after I get out of the game I have ANOTHER chat restriction? Really? I think you should actually REVIEW the reports people send in instead of just throwing a chat restriction at someone because some unhappy idiot in the game decides to report you. Another thing, there is this thing called the 'MUTE' button, use it. Focus more on punishing trolls, intentional feeders & actually review reports, because half the time you get reported it's from a group of 12 year old children who are queuing together or some kid that takes the game way too seriously and doesn't approve of your score.","replies":[{"poster":"Exhausted","date":"2015-01-09T07:50:14.622+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":1,"body":"Dont be toxic\nGet REKT!\n{{summoner:11}}","replies":[{"poster":"Sapphire","date":"2015-01-09T08:10:06.689+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":3,"body":"Nice comment, showcases your maturity level quite nicely.

Well, first of all you're an unintelligent idiot who thinks they can judge someone's character based on a post which no, isn't looking for pity, it's trying to bring an issue to Riot's attention and trying to get them to actually REVIEW reports that are made, which half the time reports are made haphazardly or meaninglessly. I said in the post I deserved a chat restriction the first time, but when I get chat restricted immediately after by saying absolutely nothing negative then there's clearly an issue. Now, I'm surprised you're not the one with a chat restriction considering your attitude is similar to that of a spoiled 12 year old brat. Also, if you're going to try and use big words to sound smart, use them correctly because there's no such thing as 'condescending' people. I suggest you attend school more often or sue your English teacher/special needs assistant.\n\nGood day, child.","replies":[{"poster":"Exhausted","date":"2015-01-09T14:56:47.098+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thankyou for proving my point :)","replies":[{"poster":"RNG Remilia","date":"2015-01-09T15:43:02.191+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":2,"body":"Ehhhh?
