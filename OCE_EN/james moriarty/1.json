How about you actually fix your fucking game.\nI was just in a game with an Olaf, and our Renekton had gone afk, but instead of helping to try to win the game, he starts intentionally feeding so the rest of us can&#039;t do anything.  And when we tried to get him to stop and actually try, he just kept saying how we were kidding ourselves, or how it was &quot;useless&quot; or how &quot;he cbf&quot;.\nIf you CBF...then why the fuck did you join a game.\n\nI&#039;m so close to quitting League, because EVERY SINGLE GAME there is at least one toxic person. \n\nFix your shit Riot.\n\nStart by actually bothering to look at Reports....\n","replies":[{"poster":"GigaPube","date":"2016-03-08T14:07:41.436+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"i dont really care that much about afks, they're too common and retards play with shitty internet all the time. what still really pisses me off is when people dont surrender at 20. like, in any case at all. -16 kills? no surrender. enemy pentakill under our inhib turret? meh. enemy just killed baron and now they're all missing cos they're farming in every corner of the jungle while we're fighting supers under nexus turrets? nope, still a chance apparently. and there always is, just not in low mmr norms of oce, never. the olaf is taking one for the team, more incentive to surrender....sometimes","replies":[{"poster":"Talon12","date":"2016-03-09T07:25:24.240+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"u kiddin... have a belly count of 37/46 games like that we won.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Talon12","date":"2016-03-09T07:24:35.769+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"you made a post about yourself, congrats","replies":[]},{"poster":"Early Feed Strat","date":"2016-03-08T17:38:13.950+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"The worst thing is players taking their anger out on one another.","replies":[]},{"poster":"A steezy Scizor","date":"2017-03-14T01:25:39.600+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"the worst thing about league is the game itself.\nit's shit.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Lapis","date":"2016-03-08T22:24:56.682+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I agree. It's unbelievable how often people who, by the way they treat other people, really shouldn't be interacting with anyone, are in my games. I really don't know what it is about this game that just brings out the worst in people. I've taken to muting everyone preemptively, which is a real shame.

(Also I don't really mind losing a few lp here and there when someone throws a hissy fit and plays ap draven, so this isn't for everyone).\n\nAlso looking at my lastgame, don't try to play a high skillcap champion through hotel wifi from across the globe. Doesn't matter how hard you try, with 1400ping you just won't do well. Buy a redemption, sit in fountain and never do it again. I feel so bad about ruining that game because everyone there was so understanding.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Essembie","date":"2016-03-09T07:08:22.943+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I used to do the same.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"andyMak","date":"2016-03-09T07:53:05.088+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I like Olaf.
