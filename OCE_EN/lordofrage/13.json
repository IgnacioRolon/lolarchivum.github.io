He had the highest win rate held over for two weeks in the history of League of Legends ever. But apart from that, he's just not that great a champion. \n\nViktor is one of the highest damaging mid laners in the game, he has incredible aoe burst and good sustained single target damage. He has great zoning and cc and is great in multiple comps, such as, wombo and siege/poke comps.","replies":[]}]}]}]}
