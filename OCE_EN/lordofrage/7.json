Overall Yasuo has a much more reliable game than Yi, because Yi is useless to his team even if he gets fed. Sure Master Yi can do tons on damage, but Yasuo has team orientated utility.\n\nWhatever your opinion, you don't really need to post this on the boards because you had a salty Yi main on your team. Yasuo does take much more skill, but you asked who is more \"OP\". So I would say Yasuo is stronger in medium - high level play. But you are level 28, so I can see how you would be mad about Yi.\n\nYeah Yasuo is stronger.","replies":[{"poster":"Erøse","date":"2016-01-13T05:38:29.110+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"yeah cause yi with\nSated + Hextech + Rageblade + Deadman is not op all.\n\nHe dives everyone and comes out without a scratch","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"lordofrage","date":"2016-01-13T00:47:09.064+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"u gotta remember that ult an the blue an red with yi lol","replies":[]},{"poster":"Alfawarrior3","date":"2016-01-12T23:58:11.840+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"yas is easily more OP.","replies":[]},{"poster":"CHEESYLEEKS","date":"2016-01-12T23:47:58.870+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"early to mid game, yasuo \nlate game, master yi, if im playing a squishy and i see master yi pop highlander and start coming towards me, im like should i even bother running.","replies":[]},{"poster":"SorakaXHealBoT","date":"2016-01-12T23:32:08.302+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I would say they are both OP and BS.
