They want to roll it out on all servers now, so a last minute test on a large server seems fine before adding it to the rest. Much better than adding it to OCE server and then the week after bringing it to big severs like NA and EUW and then spotting a bug right away.","replies":[{"poster":"Essembie","date":"2016-03-22T03:13:03.875+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Seems reasonable.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"LordCreep","date":"2016-03-16T02:00:00.117+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"i would say we will have it this week for sure but who knows when i kinda wished the boxes and keys had a IP value as well","replies":[{"poster":"Vexus","date":"2016-03-16T23:45:19.665+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"but that would mean we actually have a use for ip after owning everything, don't be silly :)","replies":[{"poster":"SouredGhost","date":"2016-03-21T23:51:53.287+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"i still have a use for IP, i feel soo noobish","replies":[]},{"poster":"LordCreep","date":"2016-03-17T01:02:34.689+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Vexus,realm=OCE,application-id=Ntey9fRZ,discussion-id=rWhuHWxp,comment-id=00010000,timestamp=2016-03-16T23:45:19.665+0000)\n>\n> but that would mean we actually have a use for ip after owning everything, don't be silly :)\n\nbahahahah noice but your right lol i have 100k IP sitting here doing nothing its really annoying","replies":[]}]}]}]}
