If the Twisted Treeline was first and Summoners Rift (or even ARAM) was in for today, the chances would be a lot better for us to reach the goal. Tomorrow is a Friday and that means everyone can play a lot later than usual so yeah, you guys kinda get the point I hope.\n\ntl;dr not popular game mode, not many people because school, patch, people got 10+ points from before, not as many people care.","replies":[]},{"poster":"LeskiHope","date":"2016-01-28T11:17:55.666+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Not only was there the patch, school just started for a lot of us!
