This way, there is more information the reform system can use to effectively and efficiently deal with negative players. The reporting system takes text from champion select lobby, in-game, and post-game into consideration, so you don't have to worry about that information being left out of the report. \n\nI'm sorry you encountered this negative player, and remember to press the report button for any negative players you encounter in the future! \n\nThanks for your diligence!","replies":[]}]}
