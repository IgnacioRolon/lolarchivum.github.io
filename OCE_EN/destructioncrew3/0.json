When we started the queue the sign came up and said \"Abandoning a match or being AFK...\" as well as 20:00. I went to watch some Youtube while waiting. Turns out that I spent 10 minutes on Youtube but the LoL LeaverBuster spent only around 3-4 minutes decreasing. Can somebody explain this?","replies":[{"poster":"Slim Chaedi","date":"2015-01-12T08:29:29.397+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It seems that fixing these issues are a low priority.","replies":[{"poster":"Project Xayah","date":"2015-01-12T09:20:06.386+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"You could say it's a low priority queue.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"KingDinger","date":"2015-01-05T23:32:32.684+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"your friend ended the queue and then restarted it, most likely.","replies":[{"poster":"destructioncrew3","date":"2015-01-12T07:38:04.292+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'm not totally sure about that but it didn't seem so :?","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Project Xayah","date":"2015-01-12T07:58:50.458+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"There's a known issue about the low priority queue timer 'resetting' for some people, could be what you're experiencing.
