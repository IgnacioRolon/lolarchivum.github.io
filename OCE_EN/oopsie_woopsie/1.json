T-twisted, malformed horrors from the d-deepest recesses of the v-very ground we stand on. You must send aid!&rsquo; a tan meek and wiry man stuttered. The council remained silent, letting the man who had introduced himself as Viljun compose himself. He furiously patted down his robe before holding his hands in front of his chest.\r\n&lsquo;Who is this she, Envoy Viljun&rsquo; a woman broke the silence from the council. Her skin was a bluish tone and her amber eyes burned brightly. Viljun had heard tales of this dragon woman before. All Shuriman&rsquo;s trembled at the mention of the name Shyvana.\r\n&lsquo;M-my master you mean? She seeks to inform the Kingdoms of Runeterra of the threat of the void. H-her name is Kai&rsquo;sa, and she-&lsquo;\r\n&lsquo;She sounds like one of them!&rsquo; Garen Crownguard interrupted as he slammed his gauntlet on the ornate table, sending Shauna Vayne&rsquo;s glass of wine tumbling to the floor, shattering instantly. An aged man with a long spear moved to block the Viljun&rsquo;s retreat.\r\n&lsquo;The name does bear similarities to what the Shuriman&rsquo;s call these monsters&rdquo; Garens sister Luxanna frowned. Viljun looked around wildly, trying to think of a better way to phrase what Kai&rsquo;sa had suggested him to say. Quickly an argument broke out amongst the members of the council due to Garen&#039;s outburst. One woman sat in complete silence, the bird perched on her shoulder craning its neck forward to get a better look at the envoy.\r\n&lsquo;The construct will defend us! There is no need to fight it at the source! Do you honestly believe Demacia could fall to this void?&rsquo; Lux argued with a much taller woman with a pink streak in her hair.\r\n&lsquo;I have fought these creatures before Luxanna and they are not to be underestimated&rsquo;\r\n&lsquo;Easy for you to say Laurent&rsquo; Vayne scoffed as she inspected her nails.\r\n&ldquo;Last time I recall, that Yordle with the hammer had to save you from one of them, Shauna&rsquo; Fiora taunted. &lsquo;A small little bug terrorising the dauntless Shauna Vayne.&rsquo;\r\nVayne cocked her wrist crossbow with an ominous click, while Fiora began to draw her rapier.\r\n&lsquo;THAT WILL BE QUITE ENOUGH!&rsquo; Prince Jarvan IV boomed as quite the loud silence descended over the table. He beckoned to the man guarding the door to be at ease.\r\n&lsquo;Viljun of Shurima. You have come to Demacia looking for mercenaries to fight a war that may very well be the death of them. I took your plea with the greatest importance and gathered the greatest fighters that Demacia has to offer.&rsquo;\r\n&lsquo;Y-yes, Kai&rsquo;sa said to gather as many able bod-&lsquo;\r\n&lsquo;I was not finished. If this &lsquo;Void&rsquo; is as much of a threat as you make it out to be, then I sadly cannot leave Demacia without its best and brightest. I can however spare one trusted lieutenant, with the condition that she will be met no harm by this woman &lsquo;Kai&rsquo;sa&rsquo;. Do we have an agreement?&rsquo;\r\n&lsquo;Of c-course Milord&rsquo; Viljun shakily bowed. &lsquo;I&rsquo;m sure that Kai&rsquo;sa will a-appreciate Demacia&rsquo;s help&rsquo;\r\n&lsquo;Quinn, are you ready to leave?&rsquo; Jarvan smiled at the woman.\r\n&lsquo;Valor and I are always ready&rsquo; Quinn smirked as she waved farewell to the other Demacians.\r\n\r\nThree weeks had passed since Viljun had requested an audience with Demacia. Quinn shifted nervously in the seat of the caravan as they moved further into the choking sands. Valor soared overhead, above the sand, stretching his wings one last time before their final destination. Across from Quinn sat a nervous Viljun, fiddling with a loose thread on his robe. A few more minutes and they would be face to face with the one he called &lsquo;Kai&rsquo;sa&rsquo;. The town of Masaris was quite unremarkable, yet a small crowd had gathered outside of its gates. Standing to the side of the crowd was a sight the unnerved Quinn. She had felt the pull of the void before on countless scouting missions, but nothing this strong. A woman stood completely engulfed in purple and grey, massive appendages protruding from her shoulders. No one else seemed to be bothered by her presence, but no one dared come close. Valor had returned to the inside of the caravan as it drew even close to the gates. He pecked at the back of Quinn&rsquo;s hand, a sign that he too was nervous. As the group of people became clearer, it was not just the void that was tying a knot in Quinn&rsquo;s stomach.\r\nShe recognised some of the faces in the crowd. First was the Noxian Assassin known as Talon. Prince Jarvan would have never provided Demacia&rsquo;s aid if he knew that envoys were being sent to the major capitals of Runeterra. Standing beside him was a massive gelatinous thing. She recalled it having a name, something starting with Z. Ticking of the clockwork woman Orianna could be heard over the light conversation.  The Cryophoenix Anivia noticed Quinn&rsquo;s presence and turned to face her. Valor clung to Quinn&rsquo;s back to try and avoid eye contact with the magnificent bird. With Anivia turning, so too did the other mercenaries. Talon&rsquo;s eyes burned away at Quinn. He was under strict orders to behave from high command due to the gravity of the situation. There were also some faces Quinn did not recognise. A teenager with rock adorned robes and a hearty laugh stood conversing with a gruff man with a large katana, whose cloak obscured most of his face.\r\n&lsquo;Valor, scan the area. Make sure this isn&rsquo;t a trap&rsquo; Quinn whispered quietly to the eagle, who took off at once to the skies. Viljun started forward towards the strange woman with an eager look on his face, whispering something in her ear.\r\n&lsquo;C-could I get your attention please&hellip;&rsquo; the woman in the suit trailed off. &lsquo;I am the one you have been told about. Kai&rsquo;sa. I have spent most of my life fighting the void, it is even part of me, but I cannot do it alone&hellip;&rsquo;\r\nThe crowd stayed silent save for the ticking of clockwork. Kai&rsquo;sa took a large gulp and continued. &lsquo;You m-may have seen creatures from the void before. Or heard of them. They are just a few of many that have seeped through into this world.&rsquo;\r\n&lsquo;What exactly do you want us to do?&rsquo; Talon rolled his eyes as he pulled his hood back up over his jet black hair. Kai&rsquo;sa opened her mouth to speak again but stopped as the ground rumbled beneath her. In an instant a freakish helmet covered her human features and she became one of them.\r\n&lsquo;To arms!&rsquo; her now piercing voice rung out clearly. Over the horizon, a massive shambling land shark had surfaced, rearing its head to let loose a guttural shriek. A bolt of pure energy surged across the sand and obliterated the wall to the right of the gate. Without hesitating, Kai&rsquo;sa surged forward, appearing in the distance next to the hulking monstrosity. The rest of the mercenaries took that as their cue to join the battle, with the teenage girl summoning a wall of stone to ride towards the creature. Quinn took a slow, deep breath as she eyed up the creature.\r\n\r\n&lsquo;Valor, to me!&rsquo;","replies":[{"poster":"3KWhisper","date":"2018-03-05T22:55:01.598+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"ahaha looks like I should change my story up a bit my first reaction to this contest was time to send {{champion:99}}  off on a trip to the void time to send {{champion:7}} instead haha","replies":[]}]}
