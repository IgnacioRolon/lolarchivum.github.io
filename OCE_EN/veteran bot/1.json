I just played Kalista in ranked for the first time in a while and I felt she was strongest at late game I also don&#039;t understand why you need skill to play her as all these guides claim. I&#039;m not a mechanical player and I thought she was easy. I was and sorta still am I terrible player last season.","replies":[{"poster":"Lord Sesshomaru","date":"2017-08-17T23:35:18.480+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Kalistsa, like all ADC's is at her prime during late game.\n\nHowever in comparison to other ADC's Kalista's lategame leaves a lot to be desired.\n\nUnlike Jhin and Draven she cant 1-shot squishies with a single auto, unlike Vayne she cant 1v5 an entire team, unlike Kog'Maw or Twitch she cant stand back and lob auto attacks into the fray.\n\nShe's a close range auto attacker _(so she has to be relatively close to the action, and therefore the danger)_, who relies on attack speed rather than damage, _(incase you hadn't noticed already, the majority of her damage comes from her Rend, her Autos are mostly just used to set up for a good Rend.)_ But because she buys attack speed instead of damage or crit, she cant lifesteal huge chunks of health like Cait/Vayne/Draven can, so she dies much easier, she also lacks any form of hard CC _(except her ult, which can hardly be called 'hers')_ she she finds it very hard to peel for herself.\n\nThe only way she survives is through her passive, however in late game, fighters and assassins and even tanks, have a lot of movement-speed boosting items, _(ADC's do not get such items)_, this coupled with the abundance of gap-closers in the game, as well as the fact that her dash can be slowed. She find's it very difficult to kite many champions. _(which is dumb because that is her entire purpose)_.\n\nSo she isn't bad in late game, it's just there are so many people who are batter.\n\nAs for her skill, her passive is very difficult to use _properly_, and you have to use it differently against many different champions. In my opinion she is quite difficult to use, but certainly achievable!\n\nAnother thing that makes her difficult is that she relies much more on her support _(or soulbonded)_ than any other champs, not only does she need perfect communication and anticipation with her support in order to use her ult correctly, but she also uses her support to help last hit minions _(something that nearly every support player doesn't understand)_. Which is not as easy as it sounds.\n\nBasically the support player also needs to have some experience with Kalista in order for you to use Kalista to her full strength, and most people just don't have this experience.\n\n\nSource: lvl 7 Kalista player.","replies":[]}]}
