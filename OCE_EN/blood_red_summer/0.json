I attempt to reconnect but it still wont let me. After about 5 attempts I somehow end up on my homescreen with no history of that match anywhere. Did someone possibly DDOS me?","replies":[{"poster":"Ediwir","date":"2015-05-21T02:36:17.943+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You, hardly. More likely, someone tried to DDoS _the server_ on which your game was (common misconception: people believe you can DDoS one game, when instead it's more like hundred of games at once), or the server crashed for other reasons (dropping the games as a result).\n\nStill, not much can be done unfortunately :/ Rito is upping security to make DDoSs harder, but plain true crashes can still happen, and attacks themselves cannot be _prevented_, only made a lot harder. It's like an arms race.","replies":[]}]}
