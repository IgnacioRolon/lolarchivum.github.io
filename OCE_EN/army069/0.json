I know that isn&#039;t a lot, but I somehow managed to spend an amount of Rp on who knows what, and now i have 259 Rp. Is there any chance Riot can give me that 1 Rp instead of having to buy some amount? I mean, i already spend enough on LoL, and I don&#039;t see much point in buying Rp, if the only skin i now want is Battle Regalia.","replies":[{"poster":"Aidan7787","date":"2016-02-17T06:39:23.066+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"you know 259 is greater than 240 don't you?","replies":[{"poster":"Roguestoney","date":"2016-02-17T20:25:42.741+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Aidan7787,realm=OCE,application-id=Ntey9fRZ,discussion-id=gJ2tmx8z,comment-id=0001,timestamp=2016-02-17T06:39:23.066+0000)\n>\n> you know 259 is greater than 240 don't you?\n\nI figured it was just a typo.","replies":[]},{"poster":"DragonOfTheVoid","date":"2016-02-17T08:30:15.561+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"lol I was thinking the same thing","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Roguestoney","date":"2016-02-17T04:03:59.299+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Usually you can send a support ticket of a drawing using MS Paint and they will gladly give you a small amount of RP.","replies":[]}]}
