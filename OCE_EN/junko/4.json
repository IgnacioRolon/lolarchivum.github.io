Here are the details for contacting Player Support:\n\nBecause this is an account-specific inquiry, we can’t help you out here on the Boards. As such, you’ll want to direct this to Riot Games Player Support by submitting a ticket! As you submit your request, here are some tips that will help resolve this issue as quickly as possible:\n\nCreate an account on the Riot Games Support website. It'll save you a lot of time in the future and keep your requests organized and easier to find/access.\nBe sure to submit as much information in your initial ticket as possible. For obvious reasons, each Player Support Specialist's request for more information will delay the resolution of the issue.\nBe respectful and polite in your correspondences with Riot Support. (They're doing their best to help you!)\nTry not create a new ticket or respond to an existing ticket before a Player Support Specialist has had the chance to review your request. New tickets/replies may bump your ticket back to the bottom of the queue, thus increasing the amount of time before a Player Support Specialist is able to review your ticket.\nIf you're unsure where to put your ticket in, just select:\n[I have a question about League of Legends/Riot Games.] > [Game and Features] > [General Questions]\" - Wuks.\n\nThanks again WUKS for the step by step guide on how to redeem the skin code and good luck everyone!!","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Junko","date":"2015-12-04T03:12:25.617+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"{{sticker:slayer-pantheon-thumbs}} \nOK It's all fine.
