Here at Pacific Peninsula we want our tournaments to be fair and fun so we decided to split the **16 teams into 2 brackets**. This makes each game fair as your team will be matched against another team of similar rank.\r\n\r\n* Bracket 1: Unranked to Gold \r\n* Bracket 2: Plat to Challenger\r\n\r\nBecause we are splitting the tournament into 2 groups of 8 teams, **each team will receive a prize even if you don&#039;t win!.** The prizes will still remain the same:\r\n \r\n* 1st place will receive Triumphant Ryze + 1000rp\r\n* Everyone else will receive a 4-win IP boost just for participating!\r\n\r\nAbout half the teams are filled so if you haven&#039;t registered already head over to our website and create an account + add your team! If you have any questions you can add me or bollockz in game or comment here.\r\n\r\nWe would like to thank Riot Games for donating all of our prizes and making these events happen!\r\n\r\n{{sticker:slayer-jinx-catface}} \r\nGoodluck everyone (I promise this will be the last update :P)","replies":[{"poster":"Junko","date":"2015-12-06T23:58:57.931+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"{{sticker:slayer-pantheon-thumbs}} \nGuys only a few spots left so get in quick!

If you are registering as a team we will use your team rank but if its just you and a group of friends (who have no official team) we will use individual ranks and work it out from there.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Myko","date":"2015-12-04T07:24:09.528+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Also, are the games best of 3 or best of 1?","replies":[]},{"poster":"Myko","date":"2015-12-04T07:22:59.963+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Is it team rank in 5v5 ranked teams or individual ranks?","replies":[]}]}
