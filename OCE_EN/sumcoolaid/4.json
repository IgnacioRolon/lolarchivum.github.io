Riot has also released statements (Mainly on our dev forums) that state modding is acceptable so long as it does not provide an unfair advantage.\r\nWhat will it do?: If Riot Games has an official end point you will have access to the data it provides.\r\n\r\n--------------------\r\nSo for a long time I have been doing all sorts of small side projects but they were never really exciting enough to finish for me. I am a professional software developer who loves league more than I should be able to. \r\n\r\nMy goal with this project is to have an app for the community and largely created with the communities input that allows players to track their progress and get every piece of data they could ever need going into a match and during.\r\n\r\nDesign: This is something I both absolutely suck at and feel is more important than any code I could ever write, If you're a designer I would applaud you to leave your name below and I would be happy to discuss the things that will need to be created.\r\n\r\nImplementation: Riot might be a bit iffy on this so any Red input would be nice. Currently I am planning to consume the data in the way perscribed on the Dev guidelines, the iffy part comes in as I'm planning to hook into the DirectX render'er to create in-game overlays, I see no issue with this but Riot may, Should this be an issue the app will run as a stand alone app that can be placed on a separate screen or in the background but design is still key in mind.\r\n\r\nSounds great what can I do?: I am always looking for designers, I would also be keen to take on some programmers into the project but I am currently not looking to mentor beyond the scope of this project as my time is very limited as is, if you have solid C++ / Qt knowledge and are looking at learning something about graphics programming feel free to drop your name below. As for designers If you can see it and create it I can use it.\r\n\r\nWill this run into the same issues as curse voice?: No, I have learned a lot from their mistakes and will ensure I work much closer with the relevant people at Riot games before releasing any builds for the public to use.\r\n\r\nIf you guys have any ideas you would like to see in a League of Legends Companion app (Reds included) please leave it here and I will compile these suggestions and add them to the GitHub Repo tracker when I create it.\r\n\r\nPeace and have a good one\r\n\r\n-SumCoolAid","replies":[]}
