I decided to do a little digging and contact them, turns out I was right in my theory that somewhere along the connection to Riots data center is a massive bottle-neck or faulty connection.\r\n\r\nIf you run a traceroute to the OCE datacenter you will find towards the end between iiNets last HOP and Riots game servers a massive ping spike almost identical to what I was getting in games.\r\n\r\nI am now in the process of moving ISP's and for now I would advise you to do the same if you're getting any ping issues in games.\r\n\r\nPS: If you have any feedback or similar experiences leave them here.\r\n\r\n-SumCoolAid","replies":[{"poster":"SumCoolAid","date":"2015-02-08T10:32:32.604+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey Cochese hope all has been well with you mate. iiNet has much larger issues in than getting to your data center how ever I will get this off to you guys, It wont be much help though.\n\n-SumCoolAid","replies":[]},{"poster":"Riot Cochese","date":"2015-02-08T04:36:16.704+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thanks for alerting us to this here.
