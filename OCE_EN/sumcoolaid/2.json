I have decided how ever to return as I still love playing the game.\r\n\r\nSome of you may know I am an avid LoL Developer who has worked a lot with the API and trying to make league a more open and accessible game. Recently I dumped windows as its not the O/S for me. Dual booting in my setup brings a host of issues I dont want to deal with and so I was stuck without League Of Legends until now.\r\n\r\nI can confirm that with some minor tweaks this video tutorial (NOT MINE!!) works with LoL on the current patch flawless.\r\n\r\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4AmTkrZxDdA\r\n\r\nQuickly my specs:\r\nXFX R9 280x\r\n16GB DDR3 Ram\r\nAMD FX 6100 6 (Fake ass) cores\r\nSSD as the primary HDD for LoL\r\n\r\n-----\r\nSome variations to the video:\r\nWhen using PlayOnLinux and selecting the wine version, select the one closest to the top. In my case the WINE version I chose was 1.7.44-LeagueOfLegends2.\r\n\r\nBefore installing League Of Legends I installed mono complete. To install mono complete open up your terminal and type\r\nsudo apt-get install mono-complete\r\n\r\nAlthough mentioned in the video its not actually shown how to install vcrun2005,vcrun2008. To install (Make sure you do this before you install League Of Legends) go to Install Components -&gt; and chose the vcrun2005/vcrun2008 and click install.\r\n--------\r\nIf you have any issues please post them here and I am sure we can sort them out.\r\n------\r\nPS: I know Riot&#039;ers probably wont comment on this (Though many of you might try it out at home :P) I would love to know the official stance on this as it does not tread in grey areas from a ToS point of view since Riot Games still has 100% control of the client AND WINE simply emulates Windows API calls.\r\nplease Riot let us know as I think helping to maintain the work that the current communities do (Such as notifying of any core dependency changes) would allow you to have a &quot;Linux&quot; client without actually doing anything.\r\n\r\nPeace.","replies":[{"poster":"dominate me","date":"2015-10-22T15:10:26.513+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Does it runs flawlessly? I see a lot of comments that say for example \"FPS drops considerably after 1 or 2 games\" or \"I can't use riot store\". Really wanna switch to ubuntu, but without league it's not possible for me lol.","replies":[]}]}
