However, when I press the \"Sure!\" uninstall it button (even now) it just disappears and a message shows up saying, \"\r\n\r\n*Do you want to allow the following program from an unknown publisher to make changes to this computer?\"\r\nProgram name: uninst.exe\r\nPublisher: Unknown\r\nFile Origin: Hard drive on this computer\r\nProgram location: C:\\Program Files\\Pando Networks\\Media Booster\\uninst.exe\r\n\r\nWhether or not I press Yes or No, the next time I start up LoL the option to uninstall PMD is still there. Also, when I tried uninstalling PMD myself in control panel, it said, \"\r\n\r\n16 bit MS-DOS Subsystem\r\nC:/PROGRA~1\\PANDON~1\\MEDIAB~1\\uninst.exe\r\nThe NTVDM CPU has encountered an illegal instruction.\r\nCS:0e30 IP:01bb OP:63 68 61 72 73 Choose 'Close' to terminate the application.\"\r\n\r\nPlease, I really need help with Pando because all of my friends say that they didn't have any problems with it and I feel like it's causing a lot of lag problems in LoL and making my computer slow in general.\r\nSorry if this seems late, I really tried a lot of options in fixing this problem but I haven't had any success.\r\nAny help whatsoever is appreciated.\r\n\r\n*I tried adding a picture of this but I think that you can't take screenshots during one of those windows.\r\nP.S. \r\nSince this is my first forum post I'm sorry if I didn't add my specs, but I'm not really sure about other specs other than the ones in control panel/computer.\r\nI have Windows 7 Professional, everything else is in the links (I hope)","replies":[{"poster":"HORSE OF FORCE","date":"2015-03-24T03:28:19.516+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":">(or even in forums at all!)\n\n{{item:3070}} These are the **boards**, not the good old **forums**. God I miss them.\n\nWhether Pando Media Booster is installed on your computer or not shouldn't actually cause it to lag or be slower by any means. It was just mandatory software included with League because of some certain thing that used to solely connect by it, and now it's no longer being used.\n\nBut still, you *should* be able to uninstall that program. You are an admin, right?","replies":[{"poster":"blackfang3","date":"2015-03-25T04:21:43.777+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"If you mean that I am an admin as in that I am able to write cool computer code commands like winsock and stuff like that, then no, I am not an admin.\n\nIf you mean that I am using an administrator account for my computer to do various things like uninstalling programs, then yeah I am an admin.\n\nI should be able to uninstall that program because I uninstall and install programs all of the time, and I have no problems. Its's just that this time it's really mind-boggling because this problem is both on my desktop and laptop, and on my laptop, I had Pando *before* I downloaded LoL. However, I just uninstalled LoL maybe a couple of minutes ago because I was trying this one method, so it shouldn't be a problem of being able to uninstall programs or not. And Pando didn't go away with LoL so I still have to solve this problem :(\n\n{{summoner:21}} Stay out Pando!\nBtw, if I'm not understanding your meaning of admin, please explain to me what you mean\nSometimes computer language can be confusing :/ (at least to me)\nAlso, the first picture that I attached to the initial post shows what happens when I try to uninstall Pando.","replies":[{"poster":"HORSE OF FORCE","date":"2015-03-26T09:06:46.637+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yes, that is what I mean. An administrative account with heightened privileges, such as the ability to install and remove programs. Sorry for the ambiguity :P\n\nIf League was not the program that installed Pando Media Booster, then it would not be able to remove it, as it wouldn't have the installation/uninstallation files required to do that.\n\nAnd since you instructed League to do that, maybe it tried using the installation files for a different version of Pando Media Booster to the one you have and hence why it's no longer working, even without League present? I'm just guessing here, though it's very likely true.\n\nYou have two options. Easiest one is to format your hard-drive and reinstall Windows, which is probably something you don't want to have to go through again so here's the other one: remove it manually.\n\nThis is probably going to be really hard, with the way that Pando integrates itself with your internet connection. You run the risk of losing your internet connection by doing this manually! If you do want to go through with it, make sure you make a backup of your computer and store it on another storage device, such as a portable hard-drive. You can do that by searching for \"Backup\" in your Control Panel, and following the prompts. Be sure to backup everything, just to be safe.\n\nWould you like to try and go through with it? You'd have to tell me your exact version of Windows you have (it looks like 7, but a shell conversion could easily fool me). This is also found in the Control Panel.\n\nHope to hear from you soon.","replies":[]}]}]}]}
