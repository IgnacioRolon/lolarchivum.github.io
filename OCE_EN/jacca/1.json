Also jayce is getting nerfed and falls in and out of the meta depending on tanks and lethality, and that just doesn't feel reliable enough to invest time to learn him for. Yeah he's the biggest lane bully in high mmr, but when he falls out of meta, he isn't very viable.","replies":[]},{"poster":"DarkShade918","date":"2017-12-20T07:01:31.145+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Gnar and Illaoi are my two favourites (Whether or not they're good on this patch i have no idea), Camille is also pretty decent, Jayce is strong so if you want 1 of those two, he's your best bet","replies":[]}]}
