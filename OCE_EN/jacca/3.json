I saved up my IP and I bought him and now I main him. He's so mobile and building Phantom Dancer and Infinity Edge gives him 100% crit chance, so you'll 2 shot any squishy with your Q. At the start I thought he would be really hard to play but I got the hang of him in about 1-2 weeks (got a penta yesterday :D) and he's super fun to play. BTW Yaauois good in any elo and all his skins look sick. Hope this helps :)","replies":[]}]}
