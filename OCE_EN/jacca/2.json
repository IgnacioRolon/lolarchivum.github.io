My friends first kill in league was with garen.... while he was AFK! Garen literally just chased down and killed the enemy by himself. True story.\nNo one else really rivals Garen in terms of easiness in top, Renekton could give him a run for his money at least, he has everything you could want in a top laner, conveniently packaged in a tanky manaless crocodile shape. Im going to add Trynd here too, not because he is necessarily easier than the other two, but because by definition, if you're immune to death it doesn't really matter what skill level you are, you're basically guaranteed to come out better than the other guy.\n\n**Jungle:** \nProbably Jax, again, there is pretty much 0 thinking required in his kit: See target, press all buttons, let Jax do the rest. Nunu is also fighting for first place here, I don't even know what sarcastic remark to make about him or his kit tbh, he just kind of embraces his simplicity to the point where you cant even really make fun of him for it, he just exists and does his thing _(good on you Nunu)_. Udyr is another option here, you only have to worry about 2 things; right clicking and left clicking. you could probably go the whole game without even touching the keyboard if you really wanted to.\n\n**Mid:** \nAnnie, she's both tanker and has more burst than most mages. What isn't a targetable homing or self-cast ability, has a massive AoE, so missing pretty much isn't an option, and even if you did manage to miss, she has a pet that does 70% of her job for her anyway. Not that he is really a true mid laner but Teemo always has a spot in these sort of things, blind someone and right click until one of you dies, not too hard.\n\n**ADC:** \nMiss Fortune, just point, click, and let go, like Jax most of her abilities are only there because they needed to somehow fill up 4 keys. If you really feel like living life on the edge, Sivir maybe could classify? but she does require actually aiming something, which introduces a whole new dynamic.\n\n**Support:** \nProbably Morgana. Spam Q's, when one finally hits, throw everything else down, press Zhonyas and let your ADC do the rest. Leona too, its hard to go wrong with being nigh on unkillable and having CC on almost every button.\n\n_____________\n\nThose are the arguably the 'easiest' champions. As for the 'best', that changes patch by patch, so theres not much point chasing champs to keep up with it _(unless you can fully master a champion in under 2 weeks?)_, but the easiest champs stay the easiest regardless, so if you want consistency, those are the ones to go for.\n\nBut personally, I don't see the need to play either the easiest or the best. Most champs only have a couple of % between their win rates anyway, so you might as well cycle through the champs till you find one you have the most fun with, then just practice and play them. When they are in a good spot, abuse it! when they're not, who cares, you'll still be good with them because you're not switching champions every 2 weeks, you're actually spending time practicing the same one.","replies":[{"poster":"QAPLA","date":"2017-12-11T08:33:49.221+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Lord Sesshomaru,realm=OCE,application-id=FjGAIbRv,discussion-id=8K8tuf0h,comment-id=0001,timestamp=2017-12-11T05:04:46.564+0000)\n>\n> like Jax most of her abilities are only there because they needed to somehow fill up 4 keys. \n\nUm, what?\nThere is so much rad stuff you can do with Jax (especially in ARAM where you can snowball in, dodge/stun, get in super quick autos with w (animation cancel or whatever they call it) and then leap to safety with q).\nMaybe a monkey _can_ play Jax, but a good player can do a lot more with him.","replies":[{"poster":"Lord Sesshomaru","date":"2017-12-11T09:26:52.825+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Im not saying you can't do cool stuff with Jax, nor that a good Jax player isnt terrifying! \ni'm saying very few of his abilities are interesting.\n\nhis Q is legitimately the most basic jump in the game \n_\"You leap, from A, to B, and deal damage.\"_\nIt's hardy the Shurima Shuffle or Lee Sin Insec.\n\nHis W might as well be a passive seeming the majority of its use is just mashing the key as fast as you can at all times while in combat.\nYea, he can auto attack reset, pretty much every champ with an auto attack enhancer can get in super quick autos, so it's hardly a unique and interesting feature of Jax. It doesn't even make that much difference to him anyway, seeing as he's usually always \nat the attack speed cap.\n\nHis ult quite literally IS a passive, and when you activate it you get a nifty bonus to your MR and armour _(ohhhhhhh the sick clutch plays you can do with it will put Vayne and Ekko to shame!!! :O)_\n\nhis E is the only thing about Jax that is even remotely interesting.\nIts the one thing that makes him unique, and quite literally 90% of any interesting or noteworthy Jax plays are to do with his E. _(a single ability)_. Even your example revolved completely around him using this ability...\nTake this 1 ability away and Jax literally becomes Udyr with a jump.\n\nThe most interesting thing you can do with the rest of hit kit aside from auto attack, is ward jump, and while that may have been interesting in season 3, it's neither interesting nor unique five seasons later.\n\nhence:\n> like Jax _**most**_ of her abilities\n\nLike Miss Fortune, Jax is built almost exclusively around auto attacking, I'm not saying thats a bad thing, or that he's a bad champ, I'm saying that because he is about auto attacking, his kit has to support that, and seeming auto attacking isn't very interesting, neither is most of his kit.\n\nSo my point is, over half of Jax's abilities _(with the only exceptions being Q and E)_ could just be permanent passives, and it wouldn't make _that much_ difference to his playstyle at all. Hence, his abilities do feel a bit space filler.","replies":[{"poster":"QAPLA","date":"2017-12-11T09:35:13.133+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Lord Sesshomaru,realm=OCE,application-id=FjGAIbRv,discussion-id=8K8tuf0h,comment-id=000100000000,timestamp=2017-12-11T09:26:52.825+0000)\n>\n> The most interesting thing you can do with the rest of hit kit aside from auto attack, is ward jump, and while that may have been interesting in season 3, it's neither interesting nor unique five seasons later.\n\nI played a lot of (jungle) Jax in Season 2, not much since (only when I roll him in ARAM).","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"00shots00","date":"2017-12-17T21:55:23.538+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"IMO the easiest champs to play in this current season/patch.\n\nTop: {{champion:57}} {{champion:54}} {{champion:223}} {{champion:516}} \nJG: {{champion:254}} {{champion:19}} {{champion:516}} \nMid: {{champion:142}} {{champion:163}} {{champion:25}} {{champion:30}} \nADC; {{champion:51}} {{champion:22}} {{champion:110}} \nSupport: {{champion:142}} {{champion:89}} {{champion:117}} {{champion:43}} \n\nif you just play relaxed and calm, and just WAIT, and counter engage. you will kill them","replies":[]},{"poster":"QAPLA","date":"2017-12-11T09:36:33.762+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"If you want to talk \"boring\" champs, I xcan give you a long list of those less interesting than Jax.","replies":[{"poster":"Lord Sesshomaru","date":"2017-12-11T09:45:28.861+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I agree there are champs more boring than Jax, but that doesn't make Jax any less boring.\nStanding next to an even uglier person, doesn't make you any prettier.\n\nThe simple fact is that Jax is outdated, he comes from another time when stuff like Chronobreak and Shadowstep just wasn't around.\nIts not Jax's fault, he just belongs to an older game.","replies":[{"poster":"QAPLA","date":"2017-12-16T03:19:20.664+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Lord Sesshomaru,realm=OCE,application-id=FjGAIbRv,discussion-id=8K8tuf0h,comment-id=00050000,timestamp=2017-12-11T09:45:28.861+0000)\n>\n> The simple fact is that Jax is outdated, he comes from another time when stuff like Chronobreak and Shadowstep just wasn't around.\n> Its not Jax's fault, he just belongs to an older game.\n\nThe funny thing is, the only time I played much Jax, was back in seasons 2-3. xD","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"QAPLA","date":"2017-12-11T09:19:29.211+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I get you Hifumi, {{champion:57}}  is God.\n\nSo much fun to play in ARAM, {{champion:57}}  and {{champion:50}}  are probs my faves...\nTanky AP's are just teh best.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Best Evelynn OCE","date":"2017-12-11T05:45:30.975+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Malphite and Maokai are now very strong in Top lane thanks to Manaflow Band.\n\nEDIT: *Typed \"not\" instead of \"now\" T_T","replies":[{"poster":"QAPLA","date":"2017-12-11T08:35:57.351+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Hifumi,realm=OCE,application-id=FjGAIbRv,discussion-id=8K8tuf0h,comment-id=0003,timestamp=2017-12-11T05:45:30.975+0000)\n>\n> Malphite and Maokai are not very strong in Top lane thanks to Manaflow Band.\n\nMao is stronk because %dmg on ranged/multi-hit/duration E.\nI only play ARAM these days, but you can build tank Mao and still get top damage.
