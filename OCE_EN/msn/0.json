I&#039;ve been stuck in bronze for so long! I&#039;m not sure if it&#039;s me or my teammates. But it feels like every lane around me is losing/feeding and losing us the game. I made a brand new account for a fresh start and had s1 elo until my last 4 games which I lost and plummeted all the way back down to bronze 1 again. Can someone PM me directly or something to help me out!! I&#039;m trying to be an ADC main. and I know I&#039;m not bad and I can carry when I have a duo support. but even then I still can win the games. I&#039;ve even resorted to coaching guides online like pro-guides and skill-capped and all that and it helps a ton but IM STILL STUCK..!#Q!\n\nUPDATE: I HAVE MADE IT OUT OF BRONZE.\n\noce.op.gg/summoner=MSN \n\n{{champion:110}} I&#039;m begging you!{{champion:110}} \n\n~MSN","replies":[{"poster":"TheDemonEmperor","date":"2018-05-27T02:59:22.081+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Sometimes, things just doesnt workout. Like IQ scores, you cant change it no matter how hard you try. Just accept bronze and you'll be alot happier.\n\nBut any way, from what i reviewed base on your matches stats. You have low dps for carry roles. Your builds make no sense, your mastery is a mess. Which lead me to believe, you didnt do any indepth research or retained any useful informations. \n\nSo am starting to question what you said about being coached or reading guides. Surely it cant be guides from bronzes?","replies":[{"poster":"MSN","date":"2018-05-27T18:31:29.795+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"It makes sense. and yea. I had a look back at my gameplay and really thought out what was going wrong. My builds were all over the place and I wasn't really a DPS at all or even a carry. I kept blaming my supports only to realize that I'm the one messing up. And I've been watching tutorials on in-depth things about the game from SKILL-CAPPED. \n\nUPDATE: I HAVE MADE IT OUT!.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Aneirin","date":"2018-06-22T02:29:41.050+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Congrats  - the best way to climb is always to focus on your own play and areas you can improve, glad to hear it's working for you :) \n{{sticker:sg-ahri-2}}","replies":[]},{"poster":"IsoLyon","date":"2018-06-22T02:20:15.585+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Mindset. Don’t lose games and think you lost because your team played poorly, lose the game thinking you didn’t carry hard enough. Find a champion you enjoy that has a decent carrying capability and learn how to carry harder than the feeders, I used Camille and Volibear to escape bronze and am currently working my way out of silver. However I am divulging into a nidalee one trick. I’m not a good player but will be eventually with this mindset.","replies":[]}]}
