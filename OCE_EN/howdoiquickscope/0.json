He has done all of these things, so it is not guaranteed to work. It is even stuck at 32% for him, which is why I believe it has no real chance of working.\nBy the way, watch my elephant blowjob porn.","replies":[{"poster":"ROTTNPELICNHOOF","date":"2015-01-18T11:16:52.017+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"sorry to hear brah...
