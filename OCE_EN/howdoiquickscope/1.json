The changing DNS only worked temporarily. So, now we can try fixing this **together**.\n\nI can confirm that releasing/renewing your IP won't work. Going to try using a VPN, because that also worked previously (though I didn't like its malicious intents.)\n\nEdit: Didn't work, as expected. Don't try it yourself. It's literally the same as changing DNS. I sent in a support ticket about three days ago, and still haven't gotten anything back about it. I'll message here if there's a solution.","replies":[]}]}]}]}
