He can be nasty but all 3 of these Champions have good early game aggression, strong AOE and all have some form of getting out of bad situations to some extent.\n\nI usually smash Yorick's, he lost a lot of his power with his nerfs after release because he was strong as an AD and when Champions had lower movespeed and when the game was more static - he's relatively weak early and now it's easier to punish him because of the way league is.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Jink","date":"2015-09-02T01:19:23.858+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Run exhaust against him, it's 5 times as good as ignite because even late game you have just destroyed his engage damage.

It'll reduce the heal from his Q and if he escapes on low HP your ignite should pick up the kill.\n\nIf his W annoys you try playing an AP Bruiser/Tank and you won't have to worry about that AD reduction. Depending on the champ you are you could try grabbing Morello's, reduces his lifesteal and Q heal. You could grab a Zhonya's too and stall out his ult. \nOr just grab a damn Randuin's Omen... 10% less damage now from crits, some nice HP and armor, Unique Passive: Cold Steel and the active slow? You're set.\n\nYes Trynd might be strong but he is by far not the most broken champ out there, I don't think he'll be getting any of Riot's attention anytime soon so I'd start looking at ways to counter him ^^ You'll find there's quite a few if you really think about it.\n\nHe is by far strongest late game so try to crush him early :^)","replies":[{"poster":"Taliyahs huge","date":"2015-09-02T01:00:39.086+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"TBH the only way so far i've found to counter him which is successful is using 3 members of the team to CC him while in his ult, but that 5 seconds where he takes no damage is basically a big fuck you to your team in a team fight","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Jink","date":"2015-08-31T20:16:28.501+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I often Tryndamere one handed and still carry 15-0.\n\nEven in lane phase.\n\nI love split pushing with Tryndamere when I have ghost Ignite as Summoner's because no one bothers coming and you just slowly split push for the win cause if they do come you just Ghost like a mother f*cker and dash over a wall and you are home scott free unless all 5 come for you - but when all 5 come for you, your ADC usually knows and just split pushes bot.\n\nSplit push based god, could win one handed with this Champion and have, Counters BS as f*ck Yi.\n\nPossible counters include: Zhonya's, Kayle ultimates and ultimate kite fests or warwicks.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Essembie","date":"2015-08-31T12:50:37.500+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Then play him and go to worlds.","replies":[]},{"poster":"GigaPube","date":"2015-08-31T11:31:29.327+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"maybe stop playing yolo assassins and start playing some tanks or supports that your team can actually benefit from.....","replies":[]}]}
