Is it seen as a reportable offense or is it not negative enough?**\n> One of our philosophies is to try to not dictate what's OK or not OK in League of Legends unless we absolutely have to. We rely on data like Reports, Honors, social media, the Instant Feedback System and Tribunal to help determine the standards of what the community believes is OK or not OK. This is why all of our systems are intentionally designed to be community-driven, because we want players to have the ability to invest in and shape their own community. In saying this, looking at the data, \"GGEZ\" is considered a negative term, and is reportable. Players generally agree that the phrase is rarely used in a positive context, and is a pretty sour way to end a match.\n-Riot Lyte\n\nYou can check out more questions and answers from Riot Lyte here - https://ask.fm/RiotLyte (hes been super busy working on Dynamic queue and new Champion Select so hasn't been as active recently)","replies":[{"poster":"Essembie","date":"2016-02-03T04:00:13.815+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Seems a bit much.

And I quite like it when cocky twats have to eat their words after I wipe the floor of the rift with them.\n\nGGEZ to me is just bad mannered sledging / banter.\n\nBut I can see how you think it could be taken as unsportsman like conduct given it is not very humble in victory.","replies":[{"poster":"Maraudaur","date":"2016-02-03T07:20:04.591+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yeah it's fine that you think its alright.

If they mean no harm (or hell if they lose the game :P) or if it's all they've said all game then whatever, it's not really worth the report. But if they've been kind of iffy otherwise, not necessarily toxic, but not exactly a shining example of humanity either, then the 'ez' tends to be the decider for if I report them or not. \n\nI also have friends who say it from time to time, and to them it's all fun and games, it's just a joke to them, but when you consider the enemies' perspective, it kinda seems like a d*ck move. My opinion is don't say unless it's REALLY obvious it's a joke (like if you lose) because it might just be that last little annoyance that tilts someone something fierce and gets you an angry essay report :)","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Darcy","date":"2016-02-03T07:10:22.527+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Maraudaur,realm=OCE,application-id=Ntey9fRZ,discussion-id=RfXYM9GX,comment-id=0000,timestamp=2016-02-03T00:09:47.911+0000)\n>\n> Hey man,\n> \n> You might find this useful \n> -Riot Lyte\n> \n> You can check out more questions and answers from Riot Lyte here - https://ask.fm/RiotLyte (hes been super busy working on Dynamic queue and new Champion Select so hasn't been as active recently)\n\nIf I get banned for talking to Ezreal, I'll be pretty damn annoyed.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Taliyahs huge","date":"2016-02-03T00:15:43.134+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thank you, I'll tell said friend about this :)","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"GigaPube","date":"2016-02-03T02:10:40.416+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":2,"body":"actually everyone that says ez is usually being obnoxious during the round anyway, and that should be chat restrictable","replies":[{"poster":"Z3npachi","date":"2016-02-03T02:41:12.889+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"It usually doesnt bother me a bit of banter during the game.
