Pedophillia is one of the few subjects that I believe shouldn&#x27;t be joked about\n\nThough I want to point out: Pedophilia doesn't bring about the shitstorm because of someone just so happens to like younger kids more, nor is it because that it's scientifically wrong in particular as our genitals are matured enough to be capable of producing offsprings before turning 10 years old, but because of moral reasons that determine children below a certain age are highly unlikely to be capable of understanding consequences and be mentally mature enough to make big decisions on their own without outside influences and thus \"special relationships\" are legally banned prior to that certain age for that reason.\n\nThat and pedophilia is often associated with child-rape, even though that's a problem to do with rape itself rather than having to do with someone's sexual preferences, because rape can happen to any sex and any age regardless of the culprit's personal sexual preferences. A rapist is wrong because they rape and not because what their ideal partner is, nor is the latter factor contributing or instigating the likeness of committing the said crime.\n\nWhat I'm trying to get to is that indeed, it's no joking matter, but we also shouldn't ust completely avoid it like it's the next Black Death either. And we should always trying to get better picture of the matters and how things are rather than following what is said.\n\nBut anyway, just doodling.","replies":[{"poster":"Mortis Ex","date":"2017-01-14T13:47:44.982+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=SEKAI,realm=OCE,application-id=Ntey9fRZ,discussion-id=VI6r8NNW,comment-id=000000000000,timestamp=2017-01-14T10:30:12.571+0000)\n>\n children below a certain age are highly unlikely to be capable of understanding consequences and be mentally mature enough to make big decisions on their own without outside influences\n\nArent we talking about a little psycho that loves setting people on fire and laughing about it?

Here is a pretty good article on why.\nhttp://www.spiked-online.com/newsite/article/should-anything-be-beyond-a-joke/17964\n\"Good jokes are generally in bad taste. They tend to mock the respectable rules and morals of society. By its nature comedy is always controversial, pushing as it must at the limits of what passes for taste and decency in any era. It is hard to think of a good joke that would not offend somebody. That is why there have long been attempts to control what is deemed ‘acceptable’ humour and to censor what is not. And why many writers and comedians have tried to subvert the rules. However, as with other issues in the free-speech wars, the terrain has shifted. Once the complaints were about blasphemous and indecent comedy, and the censors were conservative politicians, policemen and priests. Now the protests are more often against comedians accused of breaking the new taboos – racism, sexism, ableism, homophobia, transphobia, Islamophobia, anti-Semitism and the other usual suspects. And the demands to shut them down tend to be led not by old-fashioned prudes but by radical online activists, the liberal media and even other comedians. Backed up in the UK by broadcast regulators, politicians and the newly PC police.\"","replies":[]},{"poster":"Project Xayah","date":"2017-01-14T01:15:42.537+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I was always under the impression she was around 11 or 12...\n\nCan't find anything about how old she actually is on the LoL wiki or Google, just a bunch of speculation (most of which seems to be around 8-11).","replies":[]}]}
