Cuz season is ending many players  are asking their friends to boost em up to silver if they are bronze & and to gold if they are silver just to end season well. Some just want to get those frames around them in loading screen. Some high elos ceebs playing ranked on their own account cuz of boosters from higher elo than they are therefore boosting low elos. In other words for example plat player faces challenger smurf or booster and thats why he boosts others so that he can play ranked while he himself is waiting for the new season to start and avoid demotion until then. Some high elos are playing just normals until new season, thats why winning in normals got harder too. Just wait out bro","replies":[{"poster":"Essembie","date":"2016-10-14T09:14:44.136+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It's a bit shit though.
