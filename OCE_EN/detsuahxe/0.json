(business platforms and how they interact with its consumer base)\n\nSocial Networking is a powerful recourse. and is one of the main reasons why something will become popular or is condemned.\nIf it becomes condemned in social media, most will behave like sheep and change their mindset or at least think differently or reflect upon themselves.\n\n\n\n","replies":[{"poster":"Bambooze","date":"2016-10-21T11:19:44.771+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The way you're saying it, it'll just stir up the players even more, not fix the problem lol\n\nTelling someone not to talk shit is pretty much asking them to talk shit","replies":[{"poster":"Detsuahxe","date":"2016-10-21T11:29:10.452+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Kronin,realm=OCE,application-id=FjGAIbRv,discussion-id=wrPdRPQ0,comment-id=0000000000000000000000000000,timestamp=2016-10-21T11:19:44.771+0000)\n>\n> The way you&#x27;re saying it, it&#x27;ll just stir up the players even more, not fix the problem lol\n> \n> Telling someone not to talk shit is pretty much asking them to talk shit\n\nI'm planting a seed of thought and self reflection, If your not this type of person you have nothing to worry about.\nmost people who get offended by topics like this. generally have something to hide, or are ashamed of.\n\n\nIf they continue on their course of action they will just end up punished for it. but again. that's on themselves, not anyone else.\n\nWhen you make someone aware that their behaviour isnt okay, it makes them think about their actions.\n\n\n\n> Telling someone not to talk shit is pretty much asking them to talk shit\n\nI guess the old saying would apply\nIf someone told you to jump off a bridge, would you do it?\n","replies":[{"poster":"Bambooze","date":"2016-10-22T01:54:23.086+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You're just saying it in an aggravating way.\n\nSay it respectfully and maybe people will listen.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Detsuahxe","date":"2016-10-21T09:09:16.399+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Skouriasmenos,realm=EUW,application-id=FjGAIbRv,discussion-id=wrPdRPQ0,comment-id=0000,timestamp=2016-10-21T08:56:46.851+0000)\n>\n> which is why they are being removed, to avoid toxic threads like this one ...\n\nNo, riot realised the system they had didn't work. and the entire season was a write-off\n\nit was unfair and broken in many aspects.\n\nand most people who have this badge, in game are quite toxic or passive aggressive. \n\nDon't like this thread, Feel free to not post in it and leave\n\nyour choice, not mine.\n\nPeace","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"gravityhacker","date":"2016-10-22T04:35:26.908+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"SOLOQ returning season 7 boys, i already play solo though...so yeah, just less communication from enemy team will be good.","replies":[]}]}
