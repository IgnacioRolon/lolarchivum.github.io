I casually play norms with and against plat, diamond and master tier players and play fairly well in those games. I want to get out of bronze, i am aware that it is a team game but i am constantly getting dragged down by my teammates and finding it impossible to carry. I want a champ that can literally 1v9 any game thanks.","replies":[{"poster":"Suki no Sukiru","date":"2018-05-04T11:59:50.274+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yes, Mystical LLamaz is quite right, as a yi main i can attest.\nAlthough yi is somewhat a questionable pick in this meta in that he may or may not be fed but is always a high priority to kill in a team fight.\nYi split push probably can carry a 1v9.\nShould try out MASTER YI {{champion:11}} \nHere is a quality build i have, pretty sure im one of the few who use it.\nITEMS IN ORDER\n{{item:1419}}  {{item:3153}}  {{item:3047}}  {{item:3065}} {{item:3124}}  {{item:3143}} \n\nFor runes there are 2 options, you can get LETAL TEMPO, in which you will do better in team fights and pretty good as split pusher.\nOR\nCONQUEROR\nConqueror would be best for split pushing as hitting turrets or minions charge it up, when they come at you just run up with 6 guinsoo stacks, slow with Ruined King and kill them. With the tankyness and powerfull true damage you can tower dive anyone and 1v4 is COMPLETELY POSSIBLE if done right.\nJust note that team fighting wouldnt be as nice as Lethal Tempo as you would need to first survive 4 seconds before conqueror procs.\n\nExtended fights conqueror always beats lethal tempo though.\n\nGood luck.","replies":[]},{"poster":"SOOM","date":"2018-05-01T20:20:53.387+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Well first of all according to your op.gg you hardly play ranked with only 40 games do play more of that for a start. Another point is you are doing consistently bad against low bronze and silver teams in normal games. So my advice would be get to a point where you can do well in a normal game first. \n\nImo any champ can 1v9 in bronze silver gold but if you want just play some Yi","replies":[]},{"poster":"No biggie box","date":"2018-05-03T09:55:11.792+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"try kai'sa, Xayah or jhin or kayn or riven or even yasuo if his not banned\n\nBut you have to have to know that not everyone would be like you in bronze. Some people are good but some people need time to improve on their skills. but it could be your problem because of how you play the champion or how you cooperate with them. Talk to your team mates more often. Try out many other champions because despite their appearances, they could be really easy to play and strong. Try testing out different items would work too. Just try out new things even though im not ranked yet but i know a lot of my friends would give advise to people who are stuck in a certain tier and they also gave me a lot of advice for me to prepare for ranked.","replies":[]},{"poster":"BarryButcher","date":"2018-05-02T10:23:26.869+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"1. your brain is already in the wrong place. Normals mean nothing. People play things they arent good at and don't necessarily take the game seriously in normals so they don't matter in the slightest. Admit to youself, that you are Bronze for a reason, and its definitely not your teams fault.\n\n2. You don't play ranked anywhere near enough to warrant thinking you are \"stuck\". People have hundreds of games played in the same elo, those people are stuck. You are 24LP with 39 games played. 10 of which were placements. So 29 games in Bronze 1. Not the greatest but you can hardly call yourself \"stuck\".\n\n3. You never swap your trinket for a sweeper. Super important for supports to get sweeper when they finish their sightstone upgrade. You also never buy Control Wards which are also super important.\n\n4. Your playing crap like Olaf and Illaoi support... I know they are just normals but if you genuinely want to get better, the least you can do is take your normals seriously.\n\n5. you haven't played ranked in 3 weeks. why are you whinging about it now?\n\nI would simply suggest you focus on yourself and play more. If you team plays poorly or make mistakes, don't type rage at them or point it out or passive aggressively ask \"why\". Just play. You will climb easily.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Rustling Bush","date":"2018-05-02T06:49:43.414+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"bronze is easy to get out of.","replies":[]},{"poster":"CNFAAGFKU","date":"2018-05-01T14:34:54.384+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Ikr.
