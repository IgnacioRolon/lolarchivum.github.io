I feel this will not only help me learn more roles giving me better understanding of how my teammates play thier lane but having multiple options to choose from and be confident with, 1 or 2 of the said champs are banned. Off the top of my head i think Galio, Zilean and orianna are possible candidates. Thoughts???","replies":[{"poster":"Project Xayah","date":"2018-02-01T02:56:51.241+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"{{champion:133}}\n\nOnly role I haven't played her in is Jungle, but I suck at jungle.

I've seen him Mid, Top, Jg, ADC, APC, and Support.\n\nAnnie can Mid, Top, and Support fairly well. Jungle is a bit troll but possible in low elo if you're good. APC can be done too.\n\nFiddlesticks can play Top, Mid, Jungle, and Support.\n\nTwisted Fate can Top, Mid, Jungle, APC, and Support (I have seen stun bot TF).\n\nTaliyah can Mid, Top, Support, and Jungle.\n\nThere are most likely more, but these are all that I can think of from the top of my head.","replies":[{"poster":"Driggz","date":"2018-02-01T02:14:32.329+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'd add Lulu to the list also.

Taking them into off roles would mean they would be significantly weaker than whoever you are up against. Unfortunately if you want to have a better understanding of every role you're going to have to learn a few more then 3 champions.","replies":[]}]}
