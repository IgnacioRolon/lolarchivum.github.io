An attempt to bring life back to fallen soldiers from the war. With so many failed attempts beforehand his creators made a volatile energy core from solar, nuclear and magic combined.\n\nHis first activation triggered his radioactive meltdown which killed all responsible for bringing him to life. Now the volatile soldier roams runeterra in hopes of finding someone to make him stable and safe.\n\nDescription(Basic)\nKor’vein looks kind of like a zombified version of Garen/Darius but with metal bones and plating for skin. His reactor core is inside him and the glow can been seen on his heart from the front and basically along his spine on his back.\n\nHis forearms are pneumatic pistons and his waist holds the winch which wraps around him like a belt\n\nBecause his core isn't stable, Kor’vein has to internally counteract increases to movement speed and attack speed. This is done by penalizing the opposing stat when increasing the other. Eg: for every 1% increase in attack speed there is a 0.5% decrease to his movement speed and vice versa.\n\n\nPassive - Volatile Core (Max stability 100)\nWhenever Kor’vein uses an ability or auto attacks his stability decreases. If his stability reaches 0 Kor’vein involuntarily shuts down as his maintenance protocol is initiated restoring 20% of his maximum health and refilling his stability over 2.5 seconds.\n\nWhilst Kor’vein is shut down he expels volatile gases from his core dealing 5% of his max health to all enemies caught within the fumes. Also 50% of the damage from enemy auto attacks is ignored and for each auto attack taken Kor’vein gain 5 temporary armour which lasts for 5 secs after he reactivates.\n\nLastly, when Kor’vein dies his core explodes after a short delay dealing damage to ALL caught in the blast. (half for allies) The damage scales depending on how much stability is missing with the maximum damage being 50% of his maximum health.\n\nQ - Quick Jabs (-10/15/20/25/30 stability)\nKor’vein’s next basic attack strikes twice both dealing an additional 10/20/30/40/50 damage.\nThis ability has 3 charges and can only be toggled on or off. The charges take 20 seconds to reload\n\nW - Withering Winch (-25 stability) (12/11/10/9/8 second CD)\nKor’vein fires out a winch that attaches to the first enemy champion it connects with. If the enemy champion bound by the winch leaves the threshold their movement speed is halved for 3 seconds. If the winch misses Kor’vein gains 25% movement speed for 1.5 seconds \n\nE - Expel (+5/10/15/20/25 stability) (10 second CD)\nKor’vein expels a portion of the volatile gases over 3 seconds leaving a gas cloud where activated. The cloud grows to be double the size over 3 seconds and slows enemy movement and attack speed by 15/20/25/30/35% whilst in the cloud and for 3 seconds after.\n\nR - Radioactive (+30/40/50 stability) (+50 Max stability)\nKor’vein glows with radiation steadily draining his stability. Enemies within the proximity suffer 5% of his maximum health every second. This ability cannot be turned off and only ends once the maintenance protocol has completed. Upon activating this ability Kor’vein’s base movement is increased by 30/40/50% and wears off at the same rate as his stability until he shuts down.\n\nKor’vein’s radioactive shut downs restore 30/40/50% of his maximum health instead of the usual 20% and his explosion from death does 30/40/50% additional damage as true damage. \n","replies":[{"poster":"Corvis Colvein","date":"2016-05-15T01:26:29.450+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"bump!\n\nWould you play this champion?\n\nWhat would you change and why?","replies":[]},{"poster":"DarkGate","date":"2016-05-05T01:36:03.869+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I like the concept, especially with the passive, however i have a few questions, when Kor'vein shuts down from his stability reaching 0 is he snared, stunned or Suppressed? if so for how long is he stuck vulnerable, if its over a few seconds and the heal, heals over that time it could represent interesting counterplay, where the enemy team baits Kor'vein's passive then engaging while he is unable to move, and they just have to prevent him from healing. or Kor'vein intentionaly Shuts down during a towerdive taking advantage of his increased armor and healing to survive while the enemy team is caught out of position. \nor is there no downside to shutting down?\n\nas i currently see it it seems like this champion uses a similar system to Rumble, in that you want to remain within a particular range of stability, and you want to enter Shutdown (if you get stunned or whatever) only when it's safe and you need a heal. \n\nI like most of his abilities, His Q you can save up charges and Release them for some easy additional damage (although there's no real counterplay other than waiting for him to waste the charges on minions, which a good player wouldn't really do) (also at least for me i would go with you cast Q then it resets your auto attack timer and give you your double punch.)\n\nthe W seems like a neet idea, however rewarding the player with movement speed for missing seems a little... odd\n\nE is good however rather than a trail perhaps having a stationary cloud that releases from the moment it is cast that grows slightly, so that it creates a area where the enemy team doesn't want to fight it would essentially have the same effect but both teams can play around this ability by diving past the cloud, preventing retreat, but also the allied team could rely on the enemy team being greedy and punishing that greed by engaging while they move through the cloud. \n\nthe Ult looks pretty alright it presents an issue for a Kor'vein player in that they need to make sure they are safe for their passive to trigger when it eventually will but also it means that using abilities to Prolong or shorten the effect will alter how the ultimate affects others. \n\nThat said the numbers would have to be checked in a play test. but overall i like the idea but it just needs some polish, to differentiate it from other champions with similar themes and mechanics.\n\nDark","replies":[{"poster":"Corvis Colvein","date":"2016-05-07T14:42:14.540+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thankyou for your feedback Dark.\n\nTo clarify a few things:\n\nHis Passive shutdown last for the duration of the heal but the heal can be interrupted if he is knocked up or knocked back\n\nHis Q can be made to recharge more slowly if you feel it is too easy to stockpile on charges though he is meant to have a little bit of burst potential to make enemy champions think twice about 1 on 1 fights\n\nHis W gives a movement buff if he misses as a means of initiating/escaping fights and chasing down enemies in 1 on 1. Its not essential part of the ability though and can be removed.\n\nI like the idea of a growing gas cloud that remains where it was activated. that works well and would happily consider changing it.\n\nI feel the Ult is pretty solid and is meant to emphasize the play style i am going for on him. \n\nI really want this champion to be someone who is punishing if played wrong and rewarding when played right. managing his stability is key and can be done with the abilities and calculated in-game choices\n\nAgain thankyou for your feedback","replies":[{"poster":"DarkGate","date":"2016-05-08T12:43:04.465+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Ahh that makes alot more sence, i like the sink or swim gameplay that your implementing here. to play the champion well you really have to know what you're doing","replies":[{"poster":"Corvis Colvein","date":"2016-05-09T14:29:03.119+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"have a look at my other champion [Rusken](http://boards.oce.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/player-creations/QwVcOQiE-champion-concept-rusken-the-scrapyard-horror-adc) id like to hear what you think","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Aquamarie","date":"2016-04-25T01:25:59.794+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I honestly like the overall thought put into this chr and his moves ect, but I feel there are far to many negatives to playing this champ then positives. You actually need to put thought into calculations if I get X item at such such attack speed I will lose X amount of movement speed. Then the whole running out of stability and needing to manage that and if you don't manage it well, you could be stuffing up big time.
