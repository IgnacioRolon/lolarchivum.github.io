With ruthless intent and frenzied disregard for life, Rusken has be born again to terrorize Valoran once more!\n\nAbilities\n\nPassive - Shrapnel\n\nWhenever an enemy champion is struck by an auto attack from Rusken they gain a stack of shrapnel to  max of 5 stacks. At 5 stacks the shrapnel begins to take its toll eating away 10 + 10% of the target&rsquo;s armour. All stacks fall off after 10 secs of not taking damage from champions.\n\nAlso whenever Rusken is damaged by an enemy ability he also gains stacks of shrapnel up to 10 stacks. Each stack grants Rusken 2 Armour and 2 Magic Resist. If Rusken has full stacks the next ability affecting him is ignored and all stacks are removed. All stacks fall off after 10 secs of not being damaged by enemy champion abilities.\n\nQ - Triple Treat - 1/2/3/4/5% current health - 10/9/8/7/6 sec CD\n\nThe next 3 auto attacks are accompanied by 3 pieces of shrapnel each dealing 12/14/16/18/20 +20/25/30/35/40% AD. The 3 pieces are shot out in a narrow cone but will magnetize to the closest enemies if they have 5 stacks of shrapnel already.\n\nW - Caltrops - 1/2/3/4/5% current health - 20/18/16/14/12 sec CD\n\nThrows a cluster of shrapnel on the ground. All enemies that walk through it are slowed by 20/25/30/35/40% and champions gain 1/2/3/4/5 stacks of shrapnel. If Rusken walks through it he gains 2/4/6/8/10 stacks of shrapnel for himself and is immune to slows and stuns for 3 secs\n\nE - Razor Shot - 1/2/3/4/5% current health 12/11/10/9/8 sec CD\n\nFires a razor sharp saw blade that deals 20/30/40/50/60 + 10/20/30/40/50% AD damage all enemies in its path. 10/15/20/25/30% Increased damage to enemy champions with 5 stacks of shrapnel. Can be charged for extra range.\n\nR - Killing Floor - 10/20/30% current health - 180 sec CD\n\nLarge area (nocturnes ult range?) 1/1.5/2 sec stun after a 3/2/1 sec delay. Any enemy champion with 5 stacks of shrapnel also takes 150/200/250 +20/30/40% AD.\n\n\n\n(All values are subject to modification to make it balanced)","replies":[{"poster":"Corvis Colvein","date":"2016-05-15T01:13:32.612+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"bump!\n\nWould you play this champion?\n\nWhat would you change and why?","replies":[]},{"poster":"DarkGate","date":"2016-05-13T05:55:24.130+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"love the idea a Scrapyard menace just a few notes that i thought of while reading through. \n\nPassive Awesome, it's essentially a more balanced {{champion:90}} passive creating counterplay of choosing when to engage but it also has an active component in the form of his Q i would perhaps have a similar setup with his Q to {{champion:117}} Pix's attacks in that they are targeted but can be intercepted so that if a champion has 5 stacks they can remove the effectiveness of Ruskens Q by good placement behind creeps or friendly champions. this means they trade mobility so they take less damage.  \n\nCaltrops i like i'm assuming that if caltrops is cast on a champion who is in the area they are slowed and they gain that many stacks. \nPerhaps on top of that if they enter the area they gain Stacks of Caltrops each second they remain? perhaps 1 stack per second. that would mean a well landed skill shot of caltrops would then prep the enemy champion for Triple threat. but if you cast it and miss it still presents a problem in the form of zone control. \nalso the stun immunity segment of this is a little tricky to balance, although if it was because of his passive which grants the 1 attack shield i could see that working. there would be high level counterplay. waiting until after he gains the 10th stack to unleash the CC.  but slow immunity sounds good.  \n\nRazor Shot looks like a cool ability and while you could say while charging range Rusken is slowed but i think a better choice would be you select the direction in which the attack will travel and as you charge you can still move as normal but positioning the shot will be more difficult think if {{champion:44}} taric's E could charge up and gain range.  \n\nThe ultimate i like but a global stun... bit harsh. perhaps any targets with Shrapnel are hit by a stun (obviously lower the Delay perhaps like 1 second or so) and if they have 5 stacks they take damage (although swapping it so damage first stun if 5 stacks are present would present more counter play)  this way theres never the moment of \"oh i can't tower dive up top because Rusken is in the game and i could get stunned in a bad spot\" (obviously with the delay there would be less of that but having a karthus ult that stuns... \n\nOverall though i like it a lane bully champion that focuses on dealing damage and uses the timing on his passive to escape from bad situations or to give him breathing room when he engages. \n\nExcellent work Corvis. i hope to see more like it :D","replies":[]},{"poster":"EzeBlood","date":"2016-05-03T08:13:29.588+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"If you want, you could enter this in a little competitions I'm running.
