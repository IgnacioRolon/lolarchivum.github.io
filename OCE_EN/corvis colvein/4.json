He spent his adolescent years mastering the skills required to track down and eliminate mages so that one day he would find the one who killed his family and stole his childhood.\r\n\r\nPassive - Siphon\r\nWhenever enemy champions use abilities near Holvard he steals 1% of their current mana and adds it to his own. If his mana is full he instead gains 3% of the enemies current mana as health.\r\n\r\nQ - Mana Sting - 5% mana - 5 sec CD - long range\r\nHolvard fires a special bolt from his wrist mounted crossbow that eats 2/4/6/8/10% of the targets mana and deals true damage equal to the amount of mana devoured.\r\n\r\nW - Anti-mage Shield - 5% mana - 7 sec CD\r\nHolvard activates his unique Anti-mage Shield that absorbs the next incoming enemy ability within 2 secs. If an ability is absorbed Holvard gains 1/2/3/4/5% of his max health and the attacker is silenced for 2 secs. Additionally Holvard gains 1 permanent Magic Resist for every ability absorbed.\r\n\r\nE - Mind Intrusion - 5% mana - 9 sec CD medium range\r\nHolvard bombards an enemy champion with horrifying illusions causing them to become feared for 1/1.5/2/2.5/3 secs. If any other enemy champions come too close to the original target they too become feared for half the original length.\r\n\r\nR - Revenge - 10% mana - 10 sec CD - medium range\r\nHolvard dashes toward an enemy champion who recently damaged him and unleashes his desire for revenge upon them. The target must have dealt him damage in the last 2 secs. The damage returned is equal to 0.5/1/1.5 the damage taken + AD.","replies":[{"poster":"Corvis Colvein","date":"2016-05-25T22:33:00.011+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Bump!\n\nI would really like some feedback on this champion\n\nSome thought on how it is and what you feel needs changing and why?\n\nThankyou","replies":[]},{"poster":"Blu3 burgler","date":"2016-05-31T22:26:17.842+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I liked your idea and I think you would like mine :) this champ is blu3 burgler approved ðŸ˜†","replies":[]}]}
