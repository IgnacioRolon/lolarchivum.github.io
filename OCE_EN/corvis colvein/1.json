After being caught for theft and later again for murder, a captain in the Noxian army recruited him in favour of dealing him a death sentence to utilize his skills for the benefit of Noxus. In his service, Emrys fought alongside Darius and was noted for his relentlessness in battle. \r\n\r\nDuring Darius' purge on Noxus, Emrys was tasked with eliminating those on the list who fled the city and cut off the escape of those who were confronted by the Hand of Noxus.\r\n\r\nHe was rewarded by the possession of one of his targets, a rare magical blade that craved blood gifting its wielder with the means to feed it. Emrys entered the League of Legends to sate the hunger of his blade and rid the world of those not worthy of his challenge.\r\n\r\nStats \r\nHP - 480 + 90/lvl\r\nHP Regen - 7 + 0.7/lvl\r\nAtt Dmg - 50 + +3.5/lvl\r\nAtt Spd - 0.666 + 2.8%/lvl\r\nMove Spd - 350\r\nArmour - 23 + 3.5/lvl\r\nMag Res - 30 + 1.25/lvl\r\n\r\nRecommended Items\r\nBoots of Swiftness\r\nPhantom Dancer\r\nInfinity Edge\r\nYoumuu's Ghostblade\r\nSpirit Visage\r\nThe Bloodthirster\r\n\r\nAbilities\r\nPassive - Living Blade\r\nWith each enemy kill or assist, Emrys' living blade grows stronger increasing attack speed and life steal by 1%\r\n\r\nQ - Quick Draw / Back Stab\r\nCooldown - 10/9/8/7/6 seconds, Range - 660 \r\nEmrys quickly draws his flintlock pistol and fires a shot off at an enemy unit/champion, silencing them for 2 seconds.\r\nIf Emrys uses this ability again on the same target in the next 3 seconds, he blinks behind the target and stabs them in the back for 30/60/90/120/150 bonus damage.\r\n\r\nW - Woven Fear\r\nCooldown - 10/9/8/7/6 seconds, Range - 660\r\nEmrys loads a special slug into his flintlock pistol and fires it at an enemy champion for 20/40/60/80/100 bonus damage. After 3 seconds the victim suffers from a hallucinating  poison, fearing them for 2 seconds.\r\n\r\nE - Eviscerate\r\nRecharge Rate - 8 seconds, Range - 330\r\nEmrys ruthlessly slashes and stabs at a target enemy champion dealing 30/60/90/120/150 bonus damage plus 1%/2%/3%/4%/5% of their missing health. If the target has less then 40% health Eviscerate boosts Emrys attack speed by 10%/15%/20%/25%/30% for 4 seconds.\r\n\r\nThe Eviscerate ability consumes charges which are passively generated every 8 seconds. The maximum amount of charges available is equal the to the number of ranks in Eviscerate.\r\n\r\nR - Relentless Rush\r\nCooldown - 88/80/72 seconds\r\nEmrys breaks free of all slows and immobilizes, rushing with a ravenous haste increasing his movement speed by 15%/30%/45% for the next 8 seconds. Whilst his Relentless Rush is active Eviscerate no longer consumes charges and he is immune to immobilize effects.","replies":[{"poster":"Olee","date":"2014-12-03T04:58:21.859+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"That is a looooooooooot of CC and Utility for an AD Assassin...","replies":[]}]}
