They don't seem to be doing the same this year with Ryze, and Kha'Zix was the first skin they tried this with, so it's a bit of a mystery (possibly to Riot as well).\n\nThey could go the way of the red chromas (that you can only get in the limited time bundles), but it also may just be a matter of finding a good opportunity to re-release them.\n\nPlayer Support may be able to tell you more, but they may also just not have any info: https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/requests/new","replies":[]}]}
