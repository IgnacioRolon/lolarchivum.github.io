Whenever, I try to do an activity that requires the connection of my computer/launcher to the Riot Servers; such as the store, looking up my profile, starting a game or even in champion select, it will:\r\n\r\n1.) Take a long time to load and then, it comes up with &quot;Retrieving data from server&quot;\r\n\r\nhttp://i.stack.imgur.com/lmSG9.png\r\n\r\n2.) Say that I&#039;m in queue when I&#039;m clearly not\r\n\r\n3.) A popup will occur and tell me that an &quot;Unknown error has occurred&quot;  \r\n\r\nhttp://i.stack.imgur.com/0M6Eu.png\r\n(if photo unavailable, a quote of what it says) vvvv\r\n&quot;                                                                                                                                                                                            &quot;\r\n   Unknown Error\r\n\r\n   An unknown error has occurred\r\n\r\n   Sorry about that. We&#039;ve sent a report to the server.\r\n\r\n   If you continue encountering this error you may want to check the support site or forum for more information\r\n&quot;                                                                                                                                                                                              &quot;\r\n\r\n\r\nSeeing this message, I researched for a solution and thus I have tried:\r\n\r\n1.) Repairing the launcher\r\n2.) Deleting the patch folders (Don&#039;t really remember but deleted something) and then repairing the launcher\r\n3.) Connecting my computer with an Ethernet cable\r\n4.) Bringing my wireless connection closer to the router (with barely anything blocking)\r\n5.) Turning off my router, waiting and then turning it back on\r\n\r\nI honestly have no idea on what to do, as of course it is a new problem that I have been facing for the past 3 or so days (right before patch 5.6), thus I doubt it&#039;s a problem with my firewall and such. So I was wondering if any of you, REALLY SMART PEOPLE/Riot Admins and such have any idea on what i should do. Right now, im even sadder than {{champion:32}} with all 6 slots filled with {{item:3070}}  because he wasn&#039;t invited to any party. Please help! \r\n\r\nYours Sincerely,\r\n\r\n\r\nZFenix","replies":[{"poster":"Oleyn","date":"2016-03-13T00:51:53.764+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I've been experiencing this issue for awhile as well and have found a solution to fix it (well it's working so far). If you are using a proxy server like WTFast try connecting to LoL without it. For some reason it was what was causing the issue for me.

Then why has rito done nothing about it and if it is common why aren't we finding alot more people who experience the same thing. i recommend to rito that before they plan their next rework/new champion/new skin/new gamemode ect.. that they take a look at the problems with these servers that people are complaining about and see if they can fix it. I have watched almost all their patch notes for about a year now and none mention anything about server problems at all. so my guess is that 1: rito does not pay attention to complaints or 2: no one is experiencing this and we might as well be the first ones to encounter it.  BTW did your issues begin right after URF 2015 mode if so then yours is the exact same as mine","replies":[]},{"poster":"HORSE OF FORCE","date":"2015-03-30T07:39:53.276+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I used to get this a lot.\n\nAnd then, one day, it just stopped.\n\nI don't even.\n\nBut, you can try the following:\n1. Change your DNS to Google's Public one.\n2. Disable IPv6 (only works on <Windows 8).\n3. Disable all firewalls and anti-virus.\n4. Attach your monitor to a jet and fly it out your room.\n\nTry it all in that order, and if that doesn't work, get back to me with your OS and ISP and we'll sort something out.\n\nBest of luck!","replies":[{"poster":"ZFenixX","date":"2015-03-30T14:05:50.785+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"thanks for the help!
