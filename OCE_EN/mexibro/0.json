Luckily the break was easy to fix however I feel that a lot of people would have incurred this issue so I sent an email to the Support team, who responded quite quickly and admitted that there were numerous complaints about packaging.\r\n\r\nNow a few months later, they brought out the Ziggs statue, and I was very worried about whether or not it would come broken, but I still bought it anyway due to how much I love the Hexplosives expert. When my parcel arrived (probably took about a week and a half from US to Australia), I was pleasantly treated to a well designed custom box and foam packaging around the statue (The thresh statue only came with flimsy plastic to cover it). The very detailed statue was not broken or even scratched and feels a lot more sturdy than the previous statue.\r\n\r\nJust thought I should share my experiences with the Merch store and thank Riot for listening to the fans. {{champion:115}}","replies":[{"poster":"Sneed","date":"2015-03-18T07:53:44.124+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Need urgot plushie please","replies":[]},{"poster":"TiananmenSquarÃ«","date":"2015-03-18T10:18:58.008+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Took me a month to get my merchandise during the Christmas period because they 'could not send my package to a PO box but a physical address'.
