TL;DR at end)\r\nIf riot is trying to get people to change their play style away from the classic 2v2 support adc lane and towards things like roaming supports, then bard will simply be so much better at roaming then other supports and will instantly be banned if this strategy becomes an issue. Therefore nullifying any change to the meta at all.\r\n\r\nThe reason why Bard will be so much better than any other support in this meta shift (if it happened) is the fact that he is designed to roam. It is actually intended in his kit. He receives great passive movement speed across the map through his chimes and can influence on a lane in a matter of seconds without really needing to do much. Other champions would simply not keep up due to the exp loss out of lane (where bard gets free exp from chimes) and the fact that they simply wouldn't move quick enough across the map. Some may say 'if they get mobi boots they will move a lot faster,' and yes although this is true it will be increasing the time in which they pick up combat stats to actually help the lane they are going to.\r\n\r\nI think what has happened again is riot trying to put too much into a champions kit. This time is different though to the last few like champs released which have all had this complained about them as well. I see it as trying to shift the meta way too fast, and doing it this way now simply will wreck the chances of bringing the roaming support meta shift for a while in my views anyway. Riot would have to do individual buffs to every support champion in order for them to roam as well as Bard, as a straight out blanket fix like items for roaming would simply give the bonus in roaming to Bard as well.\r\n\r\nThe roaming support strategy is actually a really good way of getting rid of the necessity of a ranged adc - as bot could become another 1v1 bruiser or mage lane - which we all know league is dying for as since right now you simply need a range adc on your team to be effective. But I think this is overkill and riot will have to think of another way to bring this change about.\r\n\r\nI am actually really impressed with the kit riot came up with for Bard as it is so unique, and I do look forward to playing Bard as he looks really fun, but I don't think he will bring to league what Riot wishes for him to bring.\r\n\r\nTL:DR\r\nBard will be too good at roaming for any other support to even contemplate roaming as they will simply fall way too far behind due to Bards overloaded kit for roaming being so strong. This means the meta will still stay the same with the 2v2 support adc bot lane and range adc's will still be needed on every team.","replies":[{"poster":"MIKETHEDRAGON67","date":"2015-03-03T01:33:36.751+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"His E ability magical journey is able to help the jg with ganking and also ganking his own lane, and his W is a health [pack which you can leave for your adc when leaving to roam.....","replies":[]},{"poster":"DiamondAries","date":"2015-02-28T11:17:08.373+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I know Bard will be the roaming support, but I think that he has enough balance in his kit to compliment this strategy. His Ult and gate in particular are extremely unique. He will probably be really squishy too, with no real escape as his enemies are just as able to travel through gates as he himself is. His health pack, I think, is an extremely game changing ability. No, I think that Bard will indeed be a separate kind of roamer all together. Instead of ganking his lanes, he will be the medic of all the lanes, laying care packages everywhere and dropping in just in time to save a team mate.\n\nI don't think he his meta changing, he just has a very unique play style that the meta has never seen before. This is a brilliant effort by Riot to create a completely unique champion that doesn't fit into  a pre-existing niche set by other champs.","replies":[]}]}
