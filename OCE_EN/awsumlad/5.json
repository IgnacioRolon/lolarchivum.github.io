Other people in my games have been saying the same thing. Just wondering if anyone else can share their experience? My ping was roughly 80 while playing sometimes going to around 100 which is perfectly fine, but now I am getting constantly 150 ping with spikes up to as high as 350 for time spans as long as 10 seconds. It seems to have begun with the last couple of patches and possible ties in with the timing of the relocation of the NA server. I don&#039;t that could affect us but the timing does point to it. \r\n\r\nCould riot possibly respond please? I am in the process of making a ticket as well.","replies":[{"poster":"Pootisturtle","date":"2015-09-05T09:42:47.649+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Been getting the exact same problem with my ping spiking up from 30 to 400 or even 1000 every 5 seconds.\nThis has been going on for 2 days straight and usually the only ping problems I have is when my ping rises to 800 around 10pm every night.\nIt's made me go on a losing streak and I've lost so much lp from this.","replies":[]}]}
