Last season I climbed to silver 2 but am currently bronze 1 after the placement matches at the start of season 5. I haven't played much ranked this season but I expect to climb pretty fast.\r\nI have over 700 normals wins and about 250 ranked wins so I am very expirieced but have only recently been able to play consistently as to see improvement since I have had other hobbies and work to do as well.\r\nI have a good understanding of every champ and good general game knowledge.\r\nMy best roles are jungle and support but I have champs that I main in every lane that I am good at. Looking for a fun team to play with. I like to win but also have fun with whomever I am playing with. Can Skype etc. I'm a 20 year old male. Just reply to this or add me in game im Awsumlad. Cool beans.","replies":[{"poster":"Schakle","date":"2015-03-17T05:48:14.223+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey I got a ranked team with a few empty spaces and we'd be happy to have you. We got a bit of a spread right now. A couple B5s a Gold and a potential B3. (I think he's B3) We're in it for a bit of fun, but if you see a problem that really pisses you off with someone (in game) feel free to point it out and we'll probably get on it. (But don't argue over Vaan's Vi build. I've tried and it doesn't work, but it does seem to carry low level games pretty well.)\n\nFriend me in game if you're interested!","replies":[]},{"poster":"vicelore","date":"2015-03-17T05:13:22.484+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"IF you wanna duo im happy to duo.
