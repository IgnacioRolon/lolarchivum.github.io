One of her quotes is \"you think I'm crazy? Wait till you see my sister.\"\r\nI'm sure people have thought of this before but I believe this means her sister will also be a champion that riot will release some time. I think she would be a mage or bruiser champion who spams abilities.","replies":[{"poster":"Sackboy","date":"2014-12-03T02:59:09.632+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Jinx's sister is Vi.

I'm not going to go into some crazy story with the Illuminati and Roman numerals. However, Vi and Jinx share so many similarities it's hard not to believe that they're sisters.\n\nThey're both from Piltover, while this in itself means next-to-nothing, adding it onto what they have in common is just icing on the cake.\nRiot will never confirm that they're sisters or related, but they've added to much of a give-away with it, because if they confirm it it's breaking the third wall, and either Vi or Jinx will have to change personality wise, so it will ruin them both or one. And let's face it, I love Jinx's and Vi's personalities.","replies":[{"poster":"Jakiron","date":"2014-12-03T06:53:52.571+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> > > Jinx's sister is Vi.

But yeah.","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"DarkShade918","date":"2014-12-03T02:18:59.740+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Meanwhile {{champion:39}} Brother...","replies":[]}]}
