Asking for thoughts of the quality of my work on the videos I produce. All the feedback I received was incredibly helpful. Im here to ask the same question again. However this time I feel I have created a well edited and hilarious video. I do go by the quote \"The best judge is yourself\". But I thought I should ask one last time what you guys think. Just so know what I can do to lead me into the right direction when it comes to video editing.\r\n\r\nSo please if you have the time, tell me. What were the strong aspects to this video that made you giggle, and what put you off at some points?\r\n\r\nThanks all, much appreciated!","replies":[{"poster":"BackFire","date":"2015-02-10T23:56:05.147+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Sorry but it is forced humor that is really not funny. Yelling stupid %%%% into a mic and having subtitles on the screen does not make it funny, also the random mlg edits looked bad, made no sense and contributed nothing to the video. Also you and your friends over hyping a diamond player was dumb, they are just players, treat them as such.","replies":[{"poster":"villakilla117","date":"2015-02-11T07:53:50.692+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I guess I can see where you're coming from with all this.
