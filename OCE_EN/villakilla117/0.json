I've asked friends for advice on my videos and they say they are good and i've done well with the content i recorded :) But i thought i'd try expand to the community of LoL, and gather all of your opinions. Any advice would be great, i really do aim to produce content that people will love and enjoy watching.","replies":[{"poster":"Giacomo","date":"2015-01-30T12:51:26.539+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"wow that was really good, earned a sub :p\nif you keep going...","replies":[{"poster":"villakilla117","date":"2015-01-30T12:57:57.032+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thank you so much man :) Will definantly keep going, was lots of fun to record and edit.

Personally, I didn't, but whatever, I'm not offended so far either so I can't criticise that. Its just not my taste. I know other people are gonna find some of it funny so you are doing that right though.\nOne thing I really think you need is background music. There is a bit of background noise coming from the mics too. Just having a bit of background music (plenty of royalty free stuff you can use out there) could improve the video dramatically, I think. It covers up some of the background noise too. I realise you have music at some parts, but it'd be better to have music all the time. You can always change the music for the penta parts and give it higher volume, without changing the effect you already have.","replies":[{"poster":"villakilla117","date":"2015-01-30T13:20:00.125+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yes i agree with you about the background music being needed.

I like how the text on the video is done.","replies":[{"poster":"villakilla117","date":"2015-01-30T13:32:17.483+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It was all done on Sony Vegas 13, Ive been using it for years producing things for the fun of it. The text is by far the longest part to edit into the video, each word is an individual layer, therefore sizing and cropping can be a painful process.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}
