Another issue with the system is there is no context behind what&#039;s being said, they just see what was said. Another one of the chat logs was me saying to the enemy Vayne &quot;Stop feeding vayne u useless c***&quot; when she was 10/4 and the rest of her team only had one death, we were getting stomped and it was said as a joke but whoever actually reads over these logs (implying they actually exist and it&#039;s not just a bot scanning for keywords) doesn&#039;t understand that obviously. I wouldn&#039;t normally make a post about something like this but if it can happen to me can happen to anyone. Account was over 5 years old, all champs, runes, skins etc. literally $1000&#039;s of dollars spent on it.. would like some insight I&#039;ve seen a few people on here with some genuinely intelligent replies so would be interesting to see what others have to say on the fact that no one understand context behind what was said.

I do agree that an actual Rioter if there isnt one should read logs of the game, not only the logs of the reported ines, but everyone else because some things can be really taken out of context like what you stated above. Sad thing is we dont even have a tribunal on OCE to defend our rights for the account which is why im guessing the report system is operated by bots, the tribunal was actaully created for the whole purpose for players to defend their account after the report systm detects \"toxicity\" but this is onky possible on more popilated servers like NA. Thing that confuses me is why does server sieze even matter, shouldnt all servers have the same things like normak draft and stuff?","replies":[{"poster":"Valor Carrys","date":"2016-12-05T12:29:55.160+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":">the tribunal was actaully created for the whole purpose for players to defend their account after the report systm detects \"toxicity\" but this is onky possible on more popilated servers like NA.\n\nWhile i agree that we should have tribunal added back in (and normal draft), NA doesn't have tribunal either, the system was removed to get upgraded and never got given back, so basically it's solo queue from the start of season 6.","replies":[{"poster":"Tele","date":"2016-12-05T21:07:22.575+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Good point, also the purpose of the tribunal was not \"for players to defend their account\".

When i used it felt like i was contributing to cleaning up the game. I just got a feedback today when i logged in and it felt like it was an automated script sent out randomly","replies":[{"poster":"Tele","date":"2016-12-07T03:04:44.672+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yeah the old tribunal was really great. It's a shame the new Tribunal got delayed; it was supposed to be completed late 2016 but clearly that's not happening. \n\nYour point on feedback is interesting though. The feedback notification is definitely automated, but it's not random. What makes you think it is randomly handed out?","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]}
