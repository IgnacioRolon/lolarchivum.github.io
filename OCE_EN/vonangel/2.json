We just wanted to throw out a reminder we are back in action again. We have a discord server available for you guys that is open to everyone. Our first community event in early Feb with many more online tournaments planned (aimed at a community level) so there will be space for everyone to get involved no matter what rank, even for unranked players. We also have a production stream team in the works, open mic nights coming soon so prospective casters have a great platform to get out there and work on their craft with some coaching along the way, and are planning to move on to live events later in the year for Syd &amp; Melb.\r\n\r\nIf you want to get more involved in your community. Come say hey and add your League mates. All welcome.\r\n\r\n{{sticker:slayer-pantheon-thumbs}}","replies":[{"poster":"Kaiju","date":"2016-01-24T01:24:57.720+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"We have milk and cookies!
