I am MAC user and just updated open beta client couple of days ago, today i played few games in the morning but now i can&#039;t log in. it shown &quot; trying to reconnect&quot;, been trying few methods but still can&#039;t log in\r\nanyone ????????????","replies":[{"poster":"Gehirn","date":"2017-01-13T10:26:52.826+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I just started getting this too. Anyone else?\n\nI'll ask someone to check it out.\n\nEDIT: Can you tell me what ISP you're with?\n\nUPDATE 22:16 - I'm still getting the error, but as far as we can tell the amount of affected players is extremely small (we unlucky few). There are very slight changes to connection quality for TPG players, so it might just be a slight ISP issue that we have to wait out at this point :(\n(I'm getting similar wonky issues trying to patch Overwatch, it's working but cutting out every now and then)\n\nUPDATE 01:07 - More reports are starting to come in from other servers, but numbers still appear low relative to total playerbase.\n\nFINAL UPDATE - The issue was resolved early Saturday morning.\n\n**WORKAROUND**: While we work to figure out what is causing this, you can avoid the issue by logging in to Legacy client, as its older feature set does not check for updates as often so won't constantly lose connection once you're able to log in.","replies":[{"poster":"Donkeywhail","date":"2017-01-13T14:10:01.677+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'm with TPG as well, I have also been getting the connection error, been trying since the same time (4~ hours ago) to no success :(","replies":[{"poster":"Gehirn","date":"2017-01-13T14:15:55.155+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Try switching to Legacy client for now.
