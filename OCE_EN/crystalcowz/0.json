Via the USB cord they use to charge. We came up with the Key binds and here they are.\r\nX, ◻️, ▲, ⚪ - Will be your Abilities E.g. Q,W,E,R.\r\nL1, R1 - Will be your Summoner Spells E.g.

I have no idea how you could even imagine playing with less than the 17 keys + 8 way thumbpad that I use. The only reason I even use it is because it prevents my RSI from getting too severe. Seriously, there just aren't enough buttons on a console controller to be functional. And that's not even beginning to count the fact that you need to move a cursor around on the screen. I'm sorry to say it, but analog sticks are far inferior to mice when it comes to anything that isn't an fps or fifa.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Small Crow","date":"2018-01-01T20:36:32.085+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"you should use your L3 to ctrl to level up your abilities","replies":[]},{"poster":"Loko","date":"2017-07-09T07:53:22.591+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You cannot possibly get the flexibility from using an analog stick over a mouse.

One guy on YouTube even used a xylophone to play Bard. \n\nJust Google how to do it. If you can't, search up Rossboomsocks (the xylophone Bard guy). He made a video about how he managed to hook up the xylophone and controllers (for his other videos). \n\nXBox controllers can be automatically be used in PC games (provided you have MS Windows), whereas PlayStation controllers require downloadable software. You can find adaption cables for any PlayStation controller (i.e. PS2) as well. \n\nHope this helps :)","replies":[]}]}
