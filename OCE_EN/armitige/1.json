Like spam friend invites. What happened to the ignore functionality for the friends system, and for that matter the recently played with summoner list? So many features have been removed to &quot;improve&quot; the UI. Personally, I think the entire thing is awful. It&#039;s counter intuitive, most of the layout is confused, like where the chat windows are, all in different places, there seems to be zero consistency with the UI design. Flashy animations and pretty buttons does not a good UI make.","replies":[]}
