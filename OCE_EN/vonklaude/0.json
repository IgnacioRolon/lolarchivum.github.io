The marks and seals synergise and the glyphs and quints synergise. This sheet works well for Janna, Morgana and Nami. CDR is more valuable than MR in bot because you will be against an ADC who will most of the time deal more physical than magical. At 18 you could have too much CDR, but as a support you generally won&#039;t see 18: 10% CDR is the goal. The scaling on the suggested runes is acceptable for a support because they have decent scaling ratios against flat (much other scaling is bad on a support because the ratio with flat is not good enough and you won&#039;t get sufficient levels early enough in the game)._\r\n\r\n**Page 2 - Tank Support**\r\nmarks = 9 Armor\r\nseals = 9 HP\r\nglyphs = 9 MR\r\nquints = Armor\r\n_As a tank support you need to be able to stand up to their ADC. More HP isn&#039;t so helpful because they won&#039;t all-in you when you are on high HP, only when you are on low. You must also consider your HP regen time: more HP takes longer to regen. You could take HP5 but these suffer from a problem that they won&#039;t regen you quicker than opponents will deal damage to you i.e. HP5 can only help you after the fight, not during. The damage mitigation from armor is a solid option and scales well as you gain more HP from items. These runes work well on Blitz and Braum_\r\n\r\nI&#039;m posting these because for anyone who wants to main support the above runes could represent efficient buys.","replies":[{"poster":"Ingénue","date":"2016-03-07T07:05:58.853+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"I love your pages and the explanations relating to them ♥\n\nFor anyone wondering: \n\n* Utility page cost= 15,990 IP\n* Tanky page cost= 14,145 IP\n(Both probably slightly cheaper due to me using a cost calculator from S4.) \n\nPersonally I would sneak a few AD marks into the Tank page, and AP glyphs into the utility page, just for some extra kill potential/slightly more poke damage.\n\nFor more aggressive supports, such as {{champion:143}} ,{{champion:1}} ,{{champion:63}}  \nI would go for a **standard AP page:**\nMarks= 9 Magic pen\nSeals= 9 Armour \nGlyphs= 9 MR (or AP)\nQuints= 3 AP\n\nApprox cost of this page: 10,455 / 12,300 (if you sub MR for AP)","replies":[]},{"poster":"Crunch","date":"2016-03-07T15:06:24.597+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"This is another great cheap page which works well on a few supports without having to splurge out on more runes!\n\n2 Armor Quints\n1 AD Quint\n9 AD Marks\n9 Flat HP Seals (Can substitute 4-5 more armor here for Thresh)\n9 MR Glyphs\n\nWhich should give you\n11 AD\n72 HP\n13MR\n8 Armor\n\nThis is a great page for aggressive supports who look for kills or general trading in lane. It works amazingly well on Thresh, Leona and Blitzcrank. \nLeona can execute a q-auto-q combo (her q is an auto reset!) very quickly to get 3 autos in VERY easily for a minimal trade. So this is great for helping burst down people. (also it adds a _touch _ of damage onto thunderlords if you run that on her!)\n\nGet a few points on Thresh's E in laning phase and his autos will HURT. This is great paired with thresh as it gives him enough stats to be able to trade very hard in lane while still being tank enough to survive most all in situations. \n\nBlitzcrank can do a similar combo to Leona just much slower with q-auto-e-auto. With his E giving double damage. This gives this combo an effective 44 damage not including any further trading which might occur. But that along with an ignite on Leona/Blitz is usually enough to kill a squishy bot lane opponent in the early game!\n\nHappy Killing! :)","replies":[]},{"poster":"DianasGotSwag","date":"2016-03-07T06:49:17.832+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":5,"body":"What are you- nuts?

When you are Bronze, you can't assume that what you see in Challenger support pages will work for you. For example, a Challenger putting CDR on a tank support like Braum knows that they will get value from CC being up 2 seconds faster, and their skill is high enough to play around the loss in resilience. Bronze play isn't like that... to put it mildly.\n\nIn Bronze you take additional hits because you and your ADC over-committed. And you don't know that the damage you deal with +20AP means that your power spike at level 6 gives you 3 minutes of priority in your lane... so the value of those scaling-AP glyphs is lost on you. That's why I like these pages: they're durable at the level of play they are built for.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Slowdownn","date":"2016-03-07T12:34:05.938+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"In Bronze, there is no real support, you need to built damage to help with the kills.

My approach to play had been essentially been to play for a draw in my lane and look for one of my allies to pull ahead. But that leads to little control over wins and losses. You have to realise that if you can pull ahead in your lane, suddenly your lane opponents can't roam (and you can), and pressure is reduced on your other lanes: they can pull ahead more or more easily.\n\nSo maybe the 21 Armor sheet isn't ideal. I'm currently trying\n\n**Page 2 - Tank Support**\nmarks = 9 AD\nseals = 9 HP\nglyphs = 9 MR\nquints = Armor\n\nThat gives you about 8.5 AD, 72 HP, 12 MR and 13 Armor. I think it is right to want some AD to deal relevant damage.","replies":[{"poster":"vonklaude","date":"2016-03-14T08:52:41.688+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=vonklaude,realm=OCE,application-id=FjGAIbRv,discussion-id=f8vtm4EZ,comment-id=00030000,timestamp=2016-03-12T05:23:28.708+0000)\n>\n> This is such an important point.

It seems to let me get in and CC more so perhaps that's why. The CC isn't that impacted by lacking damage since its purpose is to set things up for ADC, or peel for ADC.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"JasonWazza","date":"2016-03-07T17:42:46.731+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":">quints = 3 scaling-MP5\n\nPersonally i'd suggest that instead, just take the Mana regen out of the Masteries (taking 0/12/18 or 0/18/12) instead of executioner.\n\nMeans you get this and can use these quints on something more useful.","replies":[{"poster":"vonklaude","date":"2016-03-14T08:58:15.335+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=JasonWazza,realm=OCE,application-id=FjGAIbRv,discussion-id=f8vtm4EZ,comment-id=0005,timestamp=2016-03-07T17:42:46.731+0000)\n>\n> Personally i'd suggest that instead, just take the Mana regen out of the Masteries (taking 0/12/18 or 0/18/12) instead of executioner.\n> \n> Means you get this and can use these quints on something more useful.\n\nI feel like the scaling-MP5 is working well in conjunction with the scaling-CDR. I'm playing champions with fairly binary effects so being able to cast my spells is the most impactful thing. I can't cast if on cooldown, and I can't cast if no mana. This setup does as much as runes can to alleviate those things without giving up relevant Armor and HP.\n\nTo see if this would work for you, could I suggest tracking in early levels as a support how often you aren't casting because you are oom? For me it felt too high.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"senroth","date":"2016-03-07T06:58:36.080+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"OMG TY I will be bronze 4 no time ty tyt tytytytyty","replies":[]}]}
