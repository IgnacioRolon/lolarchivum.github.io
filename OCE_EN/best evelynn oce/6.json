Wouldn&#039;t that decrease queue times? At the moment the expected value (~30s) is no where near the actual value.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, when I queue for Bots, I get a game almost instantly.","replies":[{"poster":"Wean","date":"2017-08-21T08:41:28.059+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"ARURF is just like normal pvp games, when you search for match in that mode, the game will search for human players on both sides, it search for ten players.\nWhen you search for match in Coop vs AI, it takes much less time because the game will search for human players on one side only, it search for five players.\nHeartVine is right, League of Legends players may be working on weekdays, so there is less chance of finding a match if you play on weekdays.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Project Xayah","date":"2017-08-12T03:10:49.174+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It seems to be dependant on the time of day. In the late afternoon, evening and at night is when you'll likely find the lowest queue times (for any mode, really), as that tends to be when most people are on, especially on weekdays.","replies":[]},{"poster":"TwoHeadedFreak","date":"2017-08-12T01:43:40.240+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"They made it random because you always saw the same champs every game in standard urf. Bad match ups in arurf are more severe than aram. In aram you can still win if you work as a team, but in arurf if you have to vs Ashe, vlad, nasus, eve and brand in one team then you got no chance.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Fitzky","date":"2017-08-11T23:45:21.967+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"URF is really popular not ARURF, URF is actually good and fun while ARURF is dependant on what champion you get because it's random for stupid reasons","replies":[]}]}
