That&#039;s what a star guardian is without her allies. Why did I have to be chosen? I&#039;m not suited to the hero scenes or the bright saviour of the day. I&#039;m a solo killer of all kinds. Maybe I&#039;ll get used to this eventually... I was an anonymous villain to the public, but now I&#039;m a hated vigilante who strives for protection of the civilians and the destruction of impure monsters. Sad I can&#039;t control my spikes. Kind of full of hate for both species even though I&#039;m one of them. I&rsquo;m probably both. At least my outfit isn&#039;t as flashy as the other known star guardians. \r\nMy thoughts are interrupted as I hear a scream of fear...in the distance near Valoran City Park. I collect my thoughts and jump off the dead carcass of the infernal dragon with the kind of hot breath. My inner guardian calls me yet at the same time my soul craves the blood of the indwelling intent of the monsters of darkness. \r\nI transform swiftly with the whole sparkly stuff and things I don&#039;t know the words for yet. I&#039;ve got the touch...for some violence. I fly towards the direction of the high-pitched shrieks of utter despair. As my speed deplete, I boost myself with my legs and more sparkles come out as I dash.\r\nA void has opened in the middle of the park. A huge monster with sharp teeth, summoning large spikes coming out of everywhere which spark my attention. Hey... the void stole _my_ spikes. The awfully large creature lumbers towards this awfully minuscule, green... and sparkly being. Isn&#039;t that Lulu? She&#039;s drained of mana and her other allies are nowhere to be found. She uses her last shield and makes a futile attempt to run away. The swift spikes of the corrupted monster tear away at her shield. My instincts kick in as I patiently wait for the most vulnerable moment of the void monster. Unaware of my uncontrollable hate spikes, I impale the large monster but along with Lulu on the other side. It leaves her in pain and surprise as my invisibility is uncloaked from behind the monster.\r\n&quot;Evelynn?! Ugh... you&#039;re not a star guardian? Why are you dressed in sparkly clothes, you villain?!&quot; \r\nAs my subconscious ignores her pitiful complaints, I end my battle with the copycat spiky monster with a final scratch from my shiny claws, eviscerating the monstrous creature. The void behind the dead monster closes immediately and the park is filled silence.\r\nAs Lulu clutches her spike impaled arm, a group of obnoxiously sparkly and blinding, flying people come rushing towards Lulu. Lux&#039;s group yells &quot;Lulu!&quot; in unison.\r\nI sense another large group of stars gather behind me; Ahri&#039;s group. I hear the voice of the nine tails. &quot;Aw we missed the fight?&quot; The 10 united star guardians finally saw me as they took a closer look. As I slowly revert to my cloaked state, the red one with the pigtails walks up to me and says,\r\n&quot;You&#039;re a hero. But you&#039;re hurting the wrong people. Being a Star Guardian isn&#039;t meant for you.&quot;  &quot;Jinx! Don&#039;t say that!&quot; I hear Lux scolding her, &quot;Sorry, we appreciate your contribution and we thank you for saving Lulu.&quot; Miss Fortune scans me up and down and says &quot;What&#039;s done is done ladies...and Ezreal. Let&#039;s go.&quot; My interest drops in this overcrowded and blinding area. Before both groups begin to fly in opposite directions, I sprint away from the scene with no guilt in my hands, only results.\r\n{{champion:28}} \r\n\r\nHere are some irrelevant but important notes that I took careful consideration about Evelynn: \r\n- She has no skins with special effects, interactions, recall, etc.\r\n- She is an underappreciated champion with little lore in describing her backstory.\r\n- Her abilities are quite suited to being what a vigilante, solo and unfavourable star guardian is, which is&hellip;subjectively suited to her character.\r\n- Her original skin and some others have these fancy ribbons or fabrics behind her, which can be easily retouched with a bit of sparkle.\r\n- Her lore does mention she is not entirely human, also detectable by her elf-shaped ears...it&#039;s perfect for a transformation.\r\n- In-game she is a speedy champion with a lot of potential of sparky outcomes. E.g. Her invisible state could have some special effects as she moves.\r\n\r\nOther reasons why:\r\nFor Evelynn&#039;s character of the star guardian inspired part, I understand that for this champion, her Qs are uncontrollable which is what hurts Lulu in this short story. This is also because Evelynn works alone without any sense of friendly fire until she is united with _her_ star guardian group. My design for star guardian Evelynn is that she isn&#039;t the role model for this type of character yet she has the sense of justice and protection which is what chose her to be a star guardian. \r\n- \r\nIn my subjective opinion, the next batch of star guardians should be quite different from the first and second packs. This is so the new ones attract more attention without giving off the same vibe as the old ones. Each of the 5 champions may have some sort of sense of individuality and/or solo assassin character so they prefer to do their dirty work alone. Maybe the support may have similar intentions or have a similar lore to this sense. However, as the power of star guardians unite these temporary anonymous individuals, they are forced to work together to survive and save the universe.","replies":[{"poster":"Akkordian Zoeve","date":"2017-09-16T21:24:50.258+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"<3 <3 <3\n\nI thoroughly enjoyed this :D You perfectly captured what Eve's personality would be like if she was a Star Guardian :D\n\nI really love how you wove her lore and the intricacies of her abilities into the story without taking away momentum from the main plot. I hope this story (plus your conclusion) convinces Riot to make a Star Guardian Evelynn. It would definitely be something I'd throw my money at.\n\n10/10 and *amazing* character choice <3\n{{champion:28}}","replies":[{"poster":"Kaerys","date":"2017-09-17T12:34:04.758+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Ahh thank you so much!

We don't want people to think \"oh this star guardian is better than that\", we need the new star guardians to not overlay on the previous star guardians but provide something that allows the new star guardians to shine with the old ones, not over them. In addition, with {{champion:28}}, countless possibilities are open, perhaps even an antagonist to the star guardians?","replies":[{"poster":"Kaerys","date":"2017-09-18T10:31:05.251+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Haha I agree with the significance difference between the first group of star guardians with the recent ones; its quite a gap. A new concept to pair the first and second groups instead of outshining either of them could be a better alternative as a suggestion.
