Then the leavebuster pop up showed up which forcefully makes me to commit that I will never do that again and unless I to do so they wonâ€™t let me to play the game.  Riot should understand that some people have unfixable and persistent internet problems due to their locations or service providers. This is the same as they are asking a person with diabetes to commit that he/she never get out of normal sugar levels, or asking people with metastatic cancer not to have a cancer again. Thus I will not make a commitment that is not my fault. And if Riot is able to see my game records, Riot would know I have been a real good gamer. I understand that afkers and leavers can make other gamers frustrated. But Riot should and must find constant leavers and then ban them, not just making all gamers to make a commitment or take away their freedom to play the game.  Therefore, I want you to remove the leavebuster pop up for me or else I will say goodbye to lol for good.  \r\n\r\nFYI -  I am very upset  and feel offended by the leavebuster pop up. I feel as if you are Mao or Hitler who caused sufferings to many innocent people and forcefully made them to do what they wanted.","replies":[{"poster":"HORSE OF FORCE","date":"2015-01-21T07:07:08.595+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":">Riot would know I have been a real good gamer.\n\nYou can be good but still toxic.\n\n>or else I will say goodbye to lol for good.\n\nI'm sure you'll be missed.","replies":[]}]}
