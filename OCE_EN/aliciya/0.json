I bet if im just raging here it will not work, but i will put my view to see if anyone agrees with me, and hopefully Riot might improve it later.....\r\n\r\nFirst that thinner Hp bar under our enlarged skill icon didn&#039;t help us to understand our HP....we still based on the hp bar above our champion to read our hp stat. it&#039;s a fail....\r\n \r\nSecond, you want merge the item box and champion info into mid, i can understand, but don&#039;t you think that with our skill bar  QWER and 1234567B just aside---some of them could be frequently used as active items or potion makes mid bar carries too much information?  at mean while we understand our human brain focus on the vision priority theory will picking that enlarged fancy skill icon QWER primarily and in most scenario....look up the tiny small item box became really painful......\r\n\r\nThird, Critical!!! One of the worst idea i have  EVER seen during my 25 years gaming life....HOW CAN YOU PUT A LIGHT BLUE CIRCLE UPON such a big skill icon? that is the most primary and probably MOST IMPORTANT+frequently used or checked or readed ICON in game (mini map aside) player will check every.....lets say 5 sec? or less.....  i guess we all educated to a certain level that have ability to read second measurement ......  Gray+Sec....anyone here don&#039;t understand this means: Wait, you can&#039;t use this now until it over and colored again!    \r\n\r\nANYONE here enjoy to see that QWER+DF total 6 ugly blue circles with a second indicator together upon your primary information bar ? one indicate is enough, 2 indicators makes things feel messy and confuse. At least let me chose to use second or blue circle....however, as player we can&#039;t chose remove that blue circle....above all our skills.\r\n\r\nFourth, any player here feel D+F are not important? however they are small and crowed in a corner....well after use them, you barely can read what  they are...because the very dark gray, a second indicator, and BLUE CIRCLE covered them..... So D+F icon compare with QWER&#039;s enhance...became hard to check!\r\n\r\nFifth. Team member stats was moved upon our mini map... it is OK Riot doing this.... but consider with the old UI, this new team stats indicator have 222222222 WEAKNESS to be point out!  1...........the icon sized around 50% smaller than old one and health bar was pretty much unreadable during frequent fighting, poking before engage confirmed. \r\n2..........because it getting really small now.....checking the icon after player dead became harder.... hard to check which champion dead....because they all became little gray circles with a second number up on it....  \r\n\r\nTO BE HONEST...I AM REALLY just complaining all these changes.....HOWEVER there are good improvements...... such as we can hide champion&#039;s basic stats. and adjust players information during TAB screen!  I understand some of game engineer put a lot of &quot;HARD WORK&quot; on this NEW UI...... but if something goes wrong, then we need fix it, am i right? that skill icon area work is  ANTI HUMANITY. just give the gray and second measurement back to me.....no more leaking water ( when your mana low....all became a water drip.....).
