I&#039;ve been playing constantly since the change, however my honor has not moved at all. I&#039;ve gotten quite a few 3-4x honors in games recently on a pretty consistent basis, so what is happening?\nI&#039;m getting the impression that my honor is bugged, my friends have honor 3 (and have had honor 3 for a good month or two now), while I haven&#039;t even moved.\n\nI know the new honor system is suppose to take longer as it&#039;s spanning across the entire year, but should it really be taking an excess of months to see any progress? \n\nCould anyone check why this is happening?","replies":[]}
