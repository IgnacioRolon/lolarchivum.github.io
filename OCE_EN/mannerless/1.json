Below is a thorough briefing on something I have been thinking about for some time and want to now present to the community for you&rsquo;re honest opinions. \r\n\r\nI have a fantastic idea that would truly revolutionise the game in terms of champion selection per week, when the new champions are reset. I frankly have no idea how this was not thought of already, or why if it was, Riot would not jump to implementing it immediately, because not only is it easy and extremely convenient, but obviously, it would generate much more money for them too.\r\n\r\nNow that you&rsquo;re interests are piqued, allow me to introduce my idea:\r\n\r\nI call it Personal Champion Selection or PCS, and no, before you get the wrong idea, you are not customising you&rsquo;re own 10 champs each week, those randomly assorted weekly free hero&rsquo;s are permanent and stay there for the 7 day duration without alteration at all. But what you get is the ability to chose one single champion whom may not have appeared on that roster for you to use during the week, for free.\r\n\r\nNow that were on the same page, lets elaborate, but please do read what I say before jumping to any conclusions. I will begin with the obvious why this would be good, and move on to points like how to not abuse this system and why it would generate more interest in the community along with capitol.\r\n\r\nSo firstly, we begin with the reason why people would love this and Riot would enjoy letting us have this. League of Legends has at this time 130 unique champions and obviously plan to expand their roster indefinitely (usually monthly). However, the number of free champions available each week are still only 10 and randomly chosen, meaning you are looking at lottery like chances to land someone you are interested in or desperately want to play.\r\n\r\nYou currently have a 1 in 13 chance that you may find 10 champions during the reset you are interested in, or of course, 1 in 130 chances you will find any specific champion you are desperate to try.\r\n\r\nYou might be thinking, &quot;but if I wanna play someone, why not just buy it?&quot; Well, obviously you can&hellip; just smack that credit card down on the desk or go grind some games and either way, you can purchase the desired champ. But what if, like we have seen all too many times before, you are unexpectedly not satisfied with the champ?\r\n\r\nYou originally might have seen some videos or read up on it and thought heck yes, thats so me! But when it comes to actually playing it, it just so isn&#039;t you at all, but you could refund it right? Oh sure you can, just click that button and bam, completely resolved, right? Thing is you only get to do that 3 times. As it literally 3 times and no, they don&#039;t not ever come back. Think of refunds as strikes in the prison system, use all three and you&rsquo;re boned!\r\n\r\nWhat if you could then, once each week get the interested champion into your line up and play away like you would any freebie champ instead? Is it for you? Is it not for you? Among other questions, these would be at least answered.\r\n\r\nBut of course the obvious loophole has surely made itself visible to at least a few of you by now&hellip;  &quot;What if I just got that champ every week forever, it would be like owning it right?&quot;\r\n\r\nNo. My answer to this obvious loophole is that you actually get a time lock on that champ for 30 days after you take it for the week. This ensures that the maximum you can play any champ free in this system is once for 7 days every month. But enough of outthinking possible plotters! Lets instead discuss why this is even more of a good idea than I already mentioned.\r\n\r\nYes, you get to personally choose a champ free each week, once a month per champion chosen for a total of 3 possible different champions weekly. And yes, you can use this system to literally play test whatever you might be interested in without any cost to you and in complete safety.\r\n\r\nBut more reasons for this being an excellent idea are as follows:\r\n\r\nNew players will be able to always pick comfortable and tutorial like champions to learn the very steep challenging gameplay on a consistent basis. As League of Legends is not immediately learned in a proficient enough way with the joke tutorials and zero help in the games without a dedicated friend with experience.\r\n\r\nAll players will get to play every champion at least one time for 7 days eventually, both learning how to use and counter anything their interested in or worried about. This makes peoples ability to learn sky rocket as their able to risk free, experience anything their struggling against or wanting to learn with their own hands.\r\n\r\nPeople without a huge champion pool with get to play or test anything and with their friends too, learning combo&rsquo;s, synergy, mechanics and much more without reaching into their wallet or grinding IP.\r\n\r\nThe weekly line up will be more vibrant when endlessly huge selections of just about any champion might be seen, rather that the extremely common &ldquo;free 10&rdquo; we see each week. Every game would have many new or different champions that you may not have even heard of or are actively looking to play against. This increases the learning potential and community interest in new champions they see or fight.\r\n\r\nThere&rsquo;s so much more and not just from my own mind, but from the comments that will be following this post, so be sure to write down and idea&rsquo;s you would see added to this section.\r\n\r\nAs for the corporate side of things for good old Riot looking here stroking their chin, here is why YOU would benefit:\r\n\r\nIt&rsquo;s no secret that many players are interested in a certain champ and or enjoy a free champ from the weekly pick so much, that they suddenly see a long and prosperous future together, and thus make the purchase!\r\n\r\nBy giving your consumers the literal opportunity to have the choice they want, and the freedom to make that choice, you would easily get many more interested players finding and bonding with other champions much quicker and easier.\r\n\r\nHere is my personal story of Fiora and I:\r\n\r\nI personally was so very interested in Fiora for so long, I watched her being played on youtube and in the LCS and she just screamed resonance within me. I had to have her! But as a free player, 4800 IP was steep, add to that fact I needed runes and it became a nightmare. So I decided I would wait to see if she would come out for free, and for 4 weeks I did just that with patience teetering ever thinner each passing day, while the video&rsquo;s I watched taunted me with the prize I could never have!\r\n\r\nEventually, I snapped and bought her with 4800 IP. An extremely sizeable amount for someone who had recently hit level 19. Once I got her, I practiced and played many a game, and my word&hellip; she was super, duper, absolutely frigging terrible for me! I mean wow, it was like bonding water and fire! I found her aggravating to play and the fact that I had to build a rune page (or most of one) before I set her aside to see if it would suddenly change anything, only added salt to the wound.\r\n\r\nEventually I noted to myself that she required a larger skill gap and knowledge than what I currently had, but how did I learn all these lessons? By frigging paying for it dearly, thats how!\r\n\r\nOf course, I can return her, but then I am minus a refund point and who knows what the future holds? Imagine if I could have just chose her freely whenever I wanted for a week and gave her a thorough testing out before buying her. How much better would this story have panned out?\r\n\r\nI would have found everything I now know out completely free of the tragic circumstances that came of the ordeal. Oh, and do not think for a second this story is unique, oh no! Only too often is this heard of throughout the community over multiple websites.\r\n\r\nThis is something only you can change Riot. The rest of us have no power here.\r\n\r\nSo there you have it, TL;DR\r\n\r\nThe ability to add one champion of your choice to your roster of free weekly champions once for that week and only play it one week every month.\r\n\r\nThe freedom of making the right decision for your personality and play style, which differs with us all, in a completely safe environment with zero risk.\r\n\r\nA chance to fall in love with a new champion each week and perhaps add many to your permanent pool!\r\n\r\nThe ability to learn how to play anything and how to counter anything you might struggle with, outside of watching half assed, self smug, youtube videos which may or may not help at all!\r\n\r\nExpand your play style and find the role best suited to you without the roll of the dice each reset subjects you to!\r\n\r\nThat is my idea and pitch! In my mind, I can not possibly conceive this being rejected, as it is just so helpful and obvious for any player at any stage of the game (outside of like challenger or some stuff) to grow and learn if nothing else, while increasing revenue in the process.\r\n\r\nHaving said all this, please leave you&rsquo;re votes and comments as I really want this to be at least seen by Riot.\r\n\r\nThank you for your time and patience, please have a great day, enjoy the rift and above all else, let those votes flow and get to writing some comments to express you&rsquo;re opinions!\r\n\r\n~Mannerless","replies":[{"poster":"Mannerless","date":"2016-04-13T04:26:35.594+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Cmon people, I appreciate the views and the votes, but lets keep this thread alive with some comments!","replies":[{"poster":"Featherpirate","date":"2016-04-15T08:34:30.882+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"To be fair, that is a _giant_ wall of text, with a lengthy TL;DR hidden in the midst of it, and you aren't going to get much attention on the OCE boards. Better off trying your luck on NA or something instead. :)\n\nPersonally, I don't really care for it. There's usually a champ or two each week I'm interested in trying out, and if there's a week where there isn't, well, then I play the champs I own and no free weekers instead.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Nijel","date":"2016-04-15T07:06:34.136+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"While I haven't played a champ on free rotation for a long time I can't help but feel it's outdated. Getting 10 champs a week made sense when there were far fewer champs. Today it presents players with a sliver of what's on offer. \n\nWhile I like the idea of picking a champ you want to play each rotation, especially since you need to buy them if you want to take them to ranked, I'm not sure how such a system would be to implemented into the current client and whether that would in fact be too difficult. \n\nI'd imagine a similar but less personalised result could be achieved if more champs were in each rotation or if a certain group of themed champs were offered for free during mini-events or something similar (Shurima event, Shurima champs free).","replies":[]},{"poster":"Mannerless","date":"2016-04-15T06:53:06.178+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Well, I must admit, I thought this topic would be much better received, but I guess not.
