When it comes down to it, League is a team game and I like to be a nice guy and help the team most cases, usually I have no complaints. Sometimes I do very bad and I thank others for being patient with me. Sometimes one of my team mates does really bad and I don&#039;t go at them for it, everyone has bad games and my getting angry with them won&#039;t &#039;suddenly make them play better.&#039;. \r\n\r\nBUT, One thing I really do dislike is when a team member completely ignores their own team or thinks themselves above the team to such a degree they justify their not helping merely because someone is not doing very well. In all cases, one side will eventually lose lane, it is up to laners to try to win or at least hold their lane and it is up to junglers to shift the tides of the game either through different strategies or ideas, but most importantly ganking. \r\n\r\nOnce again I&#039;ve just had a game where my lane was not doing so well, Our jungler ignored his team completely, his first gank was at 18:48, I know because at this time I and my support had died under tower. The whole team was somewhat disappointed that he had not assisted the team in any way. He&#039;d spent the whole time farming, of course this gave him a little bit of an edge and he managed to get kills but when our top laner said in all chat that he should of ganked more. The enemy team and him both said that quote his &#039;shit team of feeders&#039; wasn&#039;t worth ganking. the jungler then pretty much sided with this enemy team and allowed the game to be thrown. Most of the time I let this shit go, But I have a question.\r\n\r\nDo people even care about teamwork? Do people even care about being sportsmanlike?.  If you want, Share your experiences, thoughts or opinions, I&#039;m open to criticism.","replies":[{"poster":"JesusForgotHisGA","date":"2017-07-31T07:32:22.784+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"In fact, just to prove my point I just played my 1st game of the day since making that post.\n\nComfortably winning our game until this asswipe Ezreal decides he doesn't want to win for whatever reason and starts griefing.\n\nTurns into a 4v5 match as Ezreal is constantly dead from intent feeding and griefing our team.\n\nWe end up losing and you know what happens at the end of the game? Instead of the enemy team reporting Ezreal for blatantly throwing the game (run it up mid style) their bot lane reports me because both me and Ezreal shit on them during lane phase.\n\nI really couldn't give 2 shits about reporting me because I said nothing. But the fact that in my very 1st game of the day I run into 3 real pieces of shit is  just laughable and I'm the one who ended up getting reported. Shit like this should be a bannable offense, phantom reporting cos you got salty as fuck in game and the only reason you won is because an enemy player griefed.\n\nThis game is just one huge pile of shit! It really is. The pathetic attitudes and people that make up this server really makes me hate this game with a passion. It's funny tho because I hardly ever get this type of nonsense on other servers, just OCE. If it wasn't for the lag making skillshot champs unplayable I'd never play on this server again!\n\nI really couldn't be assed with it anymore and it's time for me to take another 6 month break in hope this steaming pile if shit will be in a better place. I doubt it, but one can only hope right?","replies":[]},{"poster":"JesusForgotHisGA","date":"2017-07-31T06:37:51.693+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Welcome to League of Legends, you must be new here? This happens in majority of games I play.\n\nThe mentality of the OCE is just rubbish. Don't expect anything less.","replies":[]}]}
