Theres already a much lower percentage of players who would play flex queue compared to the amount of people who would play ranked, and the people who only play ranked arent just going to play normals instead why cant we disable flex at 4am instead? I had no problems waiting 4.5 minutes at 3:30 to play what I only actually enjoy..  I wouldnt mind waiting up to 15 minutes for a game if its what I actually want to play. if I queue up for a flex at this time it takes 15-20 minutes anyway? I understand you want normal queues to be shorter because they naturally get longer later on but I dont think its effective most people who only play ranked arent just going to play normals and flex queues are 15-20 minutes anyway I think it would be better just to disable flex at this time or not disable ranked at all","replies":[]}
