I feel like WW is only any good if you are chasing down an already hurt opponent or you have your ulti up. If there is a team fight or you are trying to defend tower, you are just to weak.\r\n\r\nI have thought about how to fix this and I think his Q needs to be changed. I don't think WW needs the life steal ability, because he attacks quick and can regain life with a life steal item. I would like to see his Q replaced with maybe a stun or a knock up, this will make him more viable in team fights or under tower :)\r\n\r\nWhats everyone elses thoughts?","replies":[{"poster":"BarryButcher","date":"2014-12-24T14:05:55.553+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Warwick is already getting reworked at a \"sion level\". no need to ask Riot for it. its happening, but will take a long time.","replies":[]},{"poster":"FuyuMoro","date":"2014-12-24T13:47:46.973+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I see no reason in doing so, the concept of Warwick is that he is good at picking in the jungle when the enemy tries to roam, in exchange for the weakness in team fights, so i think nothing needs to be done. If you are finding it not as strong as before, its probably that rito hasn't nerf the metas enough.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Slim Chaedi","date":"2014-12-24T10:48:50.587+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Just build Ravenous Hydra and be a trolly Warwick who kills the wrong person with his ult.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Autismo Extremo","date":"2014-12-24T02:49:40.533+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Wow, it's like there's counterplay to him or something wtf","replies":[]}]}
