Up until today my League launcher, client and game have been working fine. Today I have tried opening it and the LoL symbol that shows up on the centre of the screen appears and leaves very quickly and then nothing happens. I had a search on other forums but haven&#039;t found anything that could help, I have re-installed the game and it still does the same thing. When I have task manager open the only new thing that appears when I try to launch the game is &quot;COM Surrogate&quot; and I have no idea what this is, but it shortly goes away and once again nothing happens.\r\n\r\nI&#039;m just wondering if anyone has any ideas of how I could fix this, thanks.","replies":[{"poster":"SephirothSG","date":"2016-03-14T07:21:05.567+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey there,\n\nWhat antivirus are you currently using? Have you tried disabling your antivirus before launching league?\n\nAre you running league as admin?

Thanks for the reply.\n\nI am using Norton and have not tried disabling it although I have considered it. I have tried running as admin and also compatibility mode.\nRight now (after various attempts at fixing it in different ways), I am able to get as far as champ select, however when the game tries to launch the actual match it crashes and I get the bug splat error.\n\nThanks again for replying!","replies":[{"poster":"SephirothSG","date":"2016-03-14T21:27:30.638+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Could you try disabling your antivirus temporarily and letting me know if you can get into a game (Just test with a custom game)","replies":[]}]}]}]}
