Sometimes there was dashes under the text I wrote with a drop down list with 1. gibberish writing and 2. Try Cloud Candidate.   Which is also pretty much gibberish for how much help it was.  \r\n\r\nIf I pressed enter on the text, it came out as boxes in the team chat. \r\n\r\nIt was also broken in the the in game shop so if I tried to type text to search for an item it was all box box box box and didn&#039;t search for any item.  I guess they don&#039;t keep many boxes in stock.  \r\n\r\nMy text in the pre and post game lobby was fine.  Text outside of the game in the store and in chat is fine.  It&#039;s just this last game, in game.","replies":[{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2016-10-29T14:33:48.625+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Sorry about the spam in H and S, we're working to fix it. As for your issue, especially with your note about the dropdown boxes, it sounds like your ingame text language has been changed to a language with a non latin alphabet (most typically the asian languages) and the boxes are because you don't have the font packs installed for whatever language it is. \n\nI think this might be a computer setting rather than a League setting but I can't say for sure so I would like you to try something. (Assuming you are on Windows) If you look at your taskbarin the bottom right you should see something that says ENG or similar telling you what language your keyboard is in. When you're not in game it is presumably ENG, but could you maybe start up a custom game (or just check next time you're in game) and take a look at the taskbar to see if it's something different?\n\nThe other option is to use the shortcut to change language which is Win+Space while you are in game and see if it fixes it.","replies":[]},{"poster":"GGJellybean","date":"2016-10-28T12:10:57.212+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Bump.
