It looks so horrible I want to shoot myself.\r\n\r\nI understand Riot is trying to make the game a bit more fun but seriously, the new, temporary Howling Abyss is an absolute killer. I already know there&#039;s been a plethora of threads/discussions about the new HUD (pretty sure all of them are negative) and I do agree. \r\n\r\nThe new map should just get removed in general and things should revert back. It&#039;s a pain to look at and play and for me, personally, is extremely unappealing. I&#039;m not sure if it&#039;s only me but touching on the HUD, I don&#039;t like how the items are on the right side instead of the left :(","replies":[]}
