I haven&#039;t touched it since and I was thinking about doing it soon so I need some tips (real tips; not troll tips please). I love playing Thresh support but to secure support, I should learn more supports. Now I&#039;m not too sure who I should be playing as support but I prefer someone that can play aggressively as a support and poke a lot, plus able to engage and disengage quickly.\r\n\r\nI&#039;m also fairly confident with my Renekton and Annie. If you guys look through my Match History, just please give tips on how to improve my build and how I fared against my match-ups. I&#039;d love to play more mid and top laners that are somewhat underplayed. I&#039;ve been giving Swain a go and I think he&#039;s really fun.\r\n\r\nMy main concern is my warding. I usually grab 2 Stealth Wards and when I hit 9, I transfer to a Sweeping Lens and try upgrade it. I&#039;m a heavy warder but I need really experienced tips on how to **efficiently** ward without spending too much gold. I know I still have a lot to learn but I don&#039;t want to be put into Bronze honestly.\r\n\r\nI&#039;d like to also add I have no experience playing jungle or ADC so getting any of those roles will deprive me. And if I get first pick, who should I ban? I&#039;m not certain of my ability to get Gold this season so my aim is around Silver II because that&#039;s how I am.","replies":[{"poster":"Jehovahs Witness","date":"2015-06-25T08:38:16.375+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thanks for the tips everyone! It seems that warding and potential building could be a factor in how well I can play as a support. I got my laptop back today and I need to reinstall everything first so I will TRY to put things into practice. I do tend to forget but the tip about too much wards in top lane could be very crucial. Thanks for that and I will try my best!","replies":[]},{"poster":"Scatman John","date":"2015-06-23T00:19:12.827+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Your best getting a ward/potion and a support upgrade at level 4/5 when you recall, i think?\nOther supports you might like; considering you play thresh, Nautilus and Blitzcrank. Both have similar play styles but are tanky supports, very fun nonetheless. I've seen vladimir support do well, not sure on builds but yeah. Ekko support isnt to bad for chasing champs at lower levels, and Lux is also good for cc.\nIm not really a skilled player, i ADC as vayne and i prefer tanky supports or once with CC, however, if you prefer people like Nami who can heal/powerup your ADC champ, thats also good (especially sona, if you know how to play her well).","replies":[]},{"poster":"McRuthless","date":"2015-06-22T13:07:39.731+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"With regard to warding, I'd suggest upgrading the warding totem at level 9 instead of getting sweeper (aside from when you're support obviously). It will save you a lot of money over the game (especially if you're not placing them as efficiently as you could be\n) and allow you to keep warding even when your inventory is full. Buy pink wards to clear vision in crucial areas like dragon or baron if your team is going for them (especially important when playing support, you should basically always have a pink on the feild or in your inventory). Also switch to sweeper immediately when you buy sightstone on supports, the warding totem becomes fairly useless at this point and the sweeper is much more benificial.\n\nWith regard to other support champions, stuff with hard cc and decent burst is best in my experience. Opponents will make a lot of mistakes, and having the tools to capitalise on that will mean you can snowball a big lead much easier. I'd say try out things like Annie, Morgana, Leona, Blitzcrank. Maybe also Janna if you need a more defensive pick. Thresh isn't the greatest pick in my opinion, not only is he harder to play well, but he also requires a greater degree of competence from your team (clicking lanterns, providing all the damage since you have basically none) which you really can't expect if you want to climb. Thats not to say you can't do well with thresh, but I'd wager you'd almost certainly do BETTER if you focused on more simple champions. That goes for other lanes too, playing someone like swain, who is hard to farm with and not very effective when behind, is probably not the best.","replies":[]},{"poster":"BarryButcher","date":"2015-06-22T12:22:31.931+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"If you were Bronze last season, theres a 90% chance you will be placed in Bronze again. I ended last season in Silver V and went 7-3 in my placements and got put into Silver IV this season.\n\nMy suggestion if your a support main is to DUO. Best thing you can do to make it easier on yourself. Even if you don't have a friend who ADC's, you can add a random person who plays well and you like their style and ask them to duo.\n\nI used to play Top/ADC then I started duoing with my friend and now mainly play Support (blitz). I went from Silver 3 to Gold 1 in about 3 weeks.\n\nhttp://oce.op.gg/summoner/userName=PhantomiZer\n\nTips:\n\n1. Don't psych yourself out because it \"ranked\". If you treat ranked like you would any other game you will play noticeably better.\n\n2. You should get a sweeper as soon as you buy a Sightstone. Having the warding totem and a sightstone is pretty pointless.\n\n3. Look up support builds. A Support usually builds items to help the team more than yourself. I see you build mainly like a Solo Laner with less gold.\nexample: instead of a spectres cowl/ banshees veil, build a locket. You seem to build full AP on Nami, not really want you want to do.\n\n4. If your going to play Thresh, make sure you have an impact. Use your autos in lane to harass the enemy, roam mid when your ADC is safe, etc. Its also usually the supports job to time flashes and basically help the jungler keep objectives warded.\nLearn powerspikes and when you can take a hook safely, when you have the advantage and when you should be playing back to lantern out your ADC.\n\n5. When you play top you seem to buy a RIDICULOUS amount of wards LOL like a waste of gold amount. Save yourself some gold, as top laner you can get away with upgrading your Trinket to a normal ward dropper at level 9. Basically acts like a sightstone for 250g.\nI can't see your build paths, but as a support, I like building sightstone 1st. Some higher elo players prefer to go Mobi boots first and buy individual wards, but I like the sightstone first.\n\n6. You have NEVER bought a pink ward in your life. they are SOOOO GOOD. If your Blue side, pink the tri-brush, if your Red side, pink either mid-river or the lower river bush if your constantly pushed and have lane control.\n\n7. Maining 1 champion is fine really. Its good to have 2-3 just in case your champ gets picked by the enemy or banned, but having 1 champion as your main is fine. Nami, Morgana, Lulu sounds like what you might like. Poke and disengage/engage.\nMy friend pretty much plays Jinx only and he's in Plat 3. Like 95% of his games played are Jinx.\n\n8. VERY basic warding guide. http://www.mobafire.com/league-of-legends/build/support-guide-map-control-warding-344910\n\n9.  Dodging is not a bad thing. If you get \"stuck\" playing Jungle or ADC and you know you CAN'T play those roles. Take the 3LP hit and dodge. Simply tell people in champ select \"Support please. Can't Jungle\". People usually accommodate you.\nBut you should really have a basic knowledge of all roles so you can play and not feed if you have to do them.\n\n10. As a support main its expected, but your CS when you do play a solo laner is really low. You average about 5 cs per minute. When the aim is to try and maintain 8-10 per min.","replies":[]},{"poster":"ShuffledPancake","date":"2015-06-22T11:56:13.332+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Some good supports are Alistar (Very good when used properly) Thresh, If you can get a good kalista + ali combo its op blitz is good for low elo\n","replies":[]},{"poster":"Chicken4dinner","date":"2015-06-22T11:00:03.428+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'll leave this to someone who will put in the effort because you are asking a fair bit","replies":[]}]}
