If you watch it via firefox it will show up between 10-20minutes. \n\nAlso if you have adblock on, disable it as it spams requests every 5-10 seconds which the  adblock might count it as a malicious ad.","replies":[{"poster":"GabrielTheGreat","date":"2018-10-05T01:13:28.550+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thank-you!!
