I've tried most things that are available on the internet in terms of my problem. Here's the situation, I open the client and everything seems to be in working order, however, once the update reaches 32% my speed plummets to 0KBpS and a warning comes up saying \"Unspecified error occured. Please check the Logs for more information... Continue... Send Logs\" If I click either option bugsplat occurs. Please I am getting desperate, I've tried uninstalling/reinstalling the game, deleting everything in D:\\Riot Games\\League of Legends\\RADS\\projects etc.. and many other possible solutions that ended up being more problematic than anything. Attached is the error message, help on this subject would be much appreciated.","replies":[{"poster":"HORSE OF FORCE","date":"2015-01-17T08:20:00.956+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":">Attached is the error message\n\nNothing is attached.\n\nAlso, I'm getting this same error, and have tried basically everything as well.
