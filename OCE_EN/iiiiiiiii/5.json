It looks like its a bot account. At one point I had 6 friend requests from people I didn't know and also looked like bot accounts..

You'll want to submit an Account Recovery ticket to [Support](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/requests/new) (use the \"Recover my account\" option, you'll need to be logged out to do so) to make sure that the compromise is being looked at and the account remains secure. They'll ask you a series of questions about the account to verify you're the original account user, you don't have to answer all of them, just enough to verify who you are (any information that can't be accessed through the account, Riot services, or 3rd party services will help). They will also issue a \"Security Ban\" on the account to make sure no other actions can be taken until it's been properly secured. You'll want to change your password ASAP, and I'd recommend changing the password of the registered email address as well.\n\nYou should also run a scan using any anti-virus software you have on any computers you use regularly, just to check for anything like keyloggers that may be the cause of the compromise (personally, I'd recommend Malwarebytes Anti-Malware free version for running manual scans, as it tends to pick up more than other anti-virus programs in my experience, but up to you). If you do find anything from those scans, you'll want to go through and secure any accounts (particularly banks, emails etc) that have been used on that computer recently.\n\nI'd also recommend checking out https://haveibeenpwned.com/ as it is a great resource for finding accounts that have been compromised. It's got a large database to check against, and it can really help track down all the accounts you need to secure.\n\nIf you need any additional assistance, feel free to ask.","replies":[]}]}
