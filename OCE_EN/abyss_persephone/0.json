I&#039;m on here nearly everyday.\nI don&#039;t care if you&#039;re ranked or not, I&#039;m not ranked :) I&#039;m just a noob trying to find players who are like minded and want to have a good gaming experience.\nI haven&#039;t played many normal games, i get a little bit intimidated. I really want to start playing normal games i&#039;m just a chicken and get freaked out. Also if there is anyone out there who wants to teach me how to player better, please feel free to add me :D i take criticism well (that has to be some sort of a bonus)","replies":[{"poster":"ImtheAnimal","date":"2015-05-22T03:10:11.489+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I don't know how to add you lol.\nI play ranked a fair bit. want a team tho","replies":[{"poster":"Abyss Persephone","date":"2015-05-23T12:47:23.525+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"lol ill add you when i jump back on tomorrow :D","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"DrMattie","date":"2015-05-20T08:39:58.166+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Fuckhead would be Honoured to play with you.

E.g they can stun carries in team fights, listen to jg for best decision concerning legendary monsters and if they start to lose lane play safer. And they don't go a 3v1 range at someone because they make a mistake. And people just mute people annoying them, so the don't go tilt. I'm tired of trying to make peace between people.
