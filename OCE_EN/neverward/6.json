This is probably working as intended.  After killing the villain, they will no longer be the villain unless they do something (like getting a kill) to become the villain again.  If no one else had enough kills / assists, then there might not be another villain yet.  You've just got to slow down on delivering so much justice :P","replies":[]},{"poster":"Mindstar","date":"2015-08-20T00:29:19.967+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"HI,\n\nThanks for the report - I'll pass it on to the relevant people to test further.\n\nCheers\nMindstar","replies":[]}]}
