Then I op.gg his summoner name and decided to get a closer look at his plays\n\n====================================================================\nFor EVERY lee sin Q casted on a moving enemy champion, his q hit the very last position when that champion is about to move to the next box, EVERY, I mean every single situation when he Q a moving champion!\nif you slow down the replay to .25x, you&#039;ll see this. the reason why he could hit his q is that he could q the position that the champ was about to move to the next box, it seems that q would not hit the champ because they are not on the same line, yet, because of the moving mechanics, the system would consider the champion is still in his last position\n\n\nPLEASE RIOT, a good lee sin player can do this easily, but what if he could do it EVERY time in EVERY game! is there something wrong??? \n\nPlease stop the script players and maintain a good sportsman like environment!\n\n","replies":[{"poster":"Sephyre3","date":"2016-05-03T00:47:36.901+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey iRejiax,\n\nI edited out the Summoner names/screenshots with summoner names.
