And since Yordles are quite magical creatures, just imagine everything they do to be magical and you'll save the nerves thinking about stuff like that.\nHis Gatling gun, however, is just a plain gatling gun like any other that he scraped from some old dump and hence does physical damage.\n\nThe AP scaling comes from \"bad\" design back in the days when they gave pretty much every Champion AP and AD scaling respectively when they didn't consider the possibility that people might actually make full use of the ridiculously high scalings and not just use it for some extra power by buying a Triforce. I imagine his scaling will be reworked similarly to Yi, Tryndamere and Sion once they do his visual Rework. His damage being split into Physical, Magic and True will not change though, cause that would completely change the champs purpose. And NA Riot (who are in charge of these decisions) always prefer not to \"offend\" people who main a certain character by completely changing how he works.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Garens Harem","date":"2015-01-01T12:15:42.299+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"so its harder to itemise against him","replies":[]}]}
