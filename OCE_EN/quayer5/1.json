I was pretty sure what the password was, but it didn&#039;t work. I was not sure what email the account was linked to, so I sent Riot a ticket to see if they could tell me, so I could reset my account. I didn&#039;t get a response which was annoying that I lost this account that I had level up to lvl 30. In the past few days, someone has been logging into the account and people believe it to be me, which it isn&#039;t. Since my tickets are being unnoticed, does anyone have any good ideas for getting in touch with rioters?","replies":[{"poster":"Ing√©nue","date":"2016-02-23T12:46:22.042+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"How long ago did you send the ticket? It could be a lil while before they get to your ticket.\n Did you send more than one ticket? If you did that can push your enquiry to the bottom of the que. \n\nSince it's an account verification issue, I suggest you read this [FAQ](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201751694)","replies":[]},{"poster":"GranpaOCE","date":"2016-02-24T00:08:48.390+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"if you have all the information like first champ you brought ip allt hat stuff you can recover the account if you go through the links","replies":[]}]}
