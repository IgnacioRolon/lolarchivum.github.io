You can \"win\" lane but Nasus will always be a big part of late game - Nasus will always come back late game.\n\nYou can only rely on enemy team mistakes and disadvantages like DCs, AFKs etc to win the game. \n\nOtherwise you're quite literally done for.\n____\nYou can use the time to practice instead of completely giving up and DCing or AFKing.\n____\nSome counters would help you lane against Nasus:\n{{champion:80}} {{champion:24}} {{champion:58}} {{champion:133}} \n{{champion:67}} {{champion:36}} {{champion:114}} {{champion:92}} \n\nSome of these champions are simply too tanky to kill.\nOthers have strong disengage.\nSome can negate Nasus's main damage ability (Q) completely. \nWhilst others can easily stomp their lane against a Nasus.\n____\nI'm no expert, just a Bronze II.\nI'd like to see what other players think of this scenario and how best to play it and possibly win it.

He's not, he actually sucks quite a bit. It doesn't matter if you have 1000 stacks cause you're just gonna get kited by the enemy team and you're never gonna get to touch any of the targets that matter. That being said in bronze/silver adcs and other carries don't really understand the key differences between ranged and melee champs so there's a question of whether they will even try to kite back. Anyway, point is, a nasus with more stacks is just a better splitpusher, he should never be able to carry fights for his team, so if you help your team win the game, a stacked nasus won't (read shouldn't) be able to do anything.","replies":[{"poster":"kJs","date":"2015-08-21T08:26:45.393+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"A common misconception that Gold+ players have it that every player knows how to kite and does it efficiently; this is bronze/silver. Half the players have no idea how to kite efficiently, at this level of skill Nasus has no counters once he hits late game with Q stacks.\n\nNasus is freelo at this skill level because after you get past the early game, with stacks, you will be able to kill everyone on the enemy team with relative ease once mid to late game starts.\n\nNasus has strong single target CC to lock down carries.\nThe typical Nasus build is Trinity Force/Iceborn Gauntlet with the rest being tank items.\nNasus will be able to tank for your team, especially well after he ults to catch people off guard. \n\nThe only champion that I think does really well against Nasus in teamfights is {{champion:67}}. The invisibility will throw newbie players off-guard. It's not hard to tumble and condemn a Nasus away for saftey. The innate tank busting skills that Vayne has is a great counter to Nasus once the Vayne is fed.\nOf course the Vayne player would actually need to be good enough to get past the crappy lane phase Vayne has compared to other ADCs to actually get fed and delete Nasuses.

The key here is to get better so you can see that it's no problem at all. Also all you need is a qss to get around the wither. Although I suppose a lot of players in low elo will forget they even have it during a fight.","replies":[{"poster":"kJs","date":"2015-08-25T23:39:30.077+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I agree that getting better at the game circumvents a lot of problems that said player will face but you missed the part where the OP's teammates are losing their lanes as well. Which means that the rest of his team mates are not doing well, underfarmed, likely can't buy QSS or Zhonyas or even if they did, I'd assume that that would be the only item they'd finish by the time their towers are lost.\nNasus will chunk everyone in the OP's team.\nI'm not talking about a Nasus 1v5s the team, I am talking about a Nasus with his full team against an underfed team that the OP hypothetically described. A full team that brings CC, and even more damage.\nA Nasus can easily wither the target that doesn't have any cleanse items/abilities - the pressure that this 5th player (now dead) could have brought to his/her team would have been very valuable - and turn the whole fight into a 5v4.\n\nIf the Nasus has over a couple hundred stacks I think he'd be able to two shot ADCs who get caught out in fights quite easily. I don't see why he wouldn't when he's farmed up.","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"DragonOfTheVoid","date":"2015-08-21T12:37:50.669+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"ok bud f you and every one else that say jg y you no help y you no gank boohoo you wona know y a jg will not go into a lane with a enemy being a few lv up on him with a tone of kills ect because if he goes in for a gank then he can die because of it if all you nubs don't feed your lane then we can go in and help a jg-er is there to help a lane get more fed then it is so that the game snowballs I have seen so many games were your top for example feeds wen he has the advantage over the champ but they loss lane------------------------------------------learn to lane and don't say im just another jg mane who cant lane because I also top and sup and wen I do I all ways win lane I will only ever gank if a lane is only a little behind 1 kill 2 kills cs so on but I will prioritize yhe mid lane that's 4 0 then the adc and sup that are 0 4  and 0 3 so don't feed and I can gank for you","replies":[{"poster":"SmashBro","date":"2015-08-21T16:29:49.313+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"holy shit dude I can stand to even look at what you wrote.","replies":[]},{"poster":"ninjaIRL ","date":"2015-08-21T16:03:21.925+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"English please.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"McRuthless","date":"2015-08-25T21:34:59.794+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"\"keeping on top of nasus\" is essentially making the game a 4v4.

A farmed nasus is much easier to deal with if you roamed alot and got your team fed or if he constantly has to come group so his team doesn't lose an inhib.
