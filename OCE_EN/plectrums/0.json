Usually I end up back at my desktop and have to tab back into LoL. As you can imagine this is intensely frustrating when in the middle of a team fight.\r\n\r\nThis is definitely not LoL&#039;s fault, it happens with other programs as well, but it does seem more prevalent with LoL. Basically what I want to know is if there&#039;s any way to tell what other program or background process is causing this issue?\r\n\r\nCheers!","replies":[{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2018-01-28T01:40:09.248+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Do you have any updates or anything sitting on your task bar that might be stealing the spotlight?","replies":[]}]}
