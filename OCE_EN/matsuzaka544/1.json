Nah, play this instead... I don't want to play jungle, I don't enjoy jungle; I have the choice between a 5 minute dodge timer or a 20+ minute game I know which I'll take - same goes for support.\nToxic teammates will make me dodge (if you can't keep your ego under wraps for the queue then you sure as hell aren't the type of person I'll enjoy playing with).\n\nOn the topic of dodging for MMR:\nAre you Diamond or above? Go for it. If not, I assure you, your MMR doesn't mean shit; you'll be matched up and down pretty frequently and lets be honest with ourselves - meta is far less meaningfull at these levels, almost non-existent.\nI've seen queues last for over half an hour above Diamond (not mine, I'm a silver scrub), your choice is at this point, A) Play a game you 'expect' to lose; B) spend the same time in queue doing something else, more fun, that's not going to be a free win for the enemies.\n\nCounter arguments:\nExpecting to lose a game means very little before Diamond, and even then - individual skill should dictate the outcome; play it and learn.\nThere IS a timer, and another queue; if you don't particularly care about where you go, why are you going through that again?\nThere IS autofill. I don't understand why we can't turn it off but we can't, and we're not the only ones; chances are high that you dodging an autofill game means someone else needs to fill in your stead, and that's not nice.\n\nWarwick? Stay above half health, dodge his ult, kill him because his engage is gone. He's like most junglers except his hard engage is an ult, just treat him like you would a lee sin or a vi.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Hounorsboy","date":"2017-10-17T10:59:54.902+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Lp doesn't matter, your MMR is what is important as it dictates how much lp you gain/lose and what people you play against","replies":[]},{"poster":"Azirious Mistake","date":"2017-10-17T06:32:20.628+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Stay above half health so he doesnt get bonus movespeed.","replies":[]}]}
