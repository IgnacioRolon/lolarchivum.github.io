Its basically the Spectator stream. OBS is a great, free recording and streaming tool which you can record your point of view as you play.\n\nOBS can be a bit fiddly to set up first so ill give you a step by step\n\n1. Open up OBS\n\n2. Open up League and start up a Tutorial/Custom and start it. You want to be in-game at this point. Once your in-game, alt-tab out and go back to OBS.\n\n3. Right Click the field box under \"Scenes\" and click the \"Add Scene\" button from the RightClick Menu. Enter the name of the Scene, eg. \"LoLReplay\".\n\n4. Select the Scene you just made by left clicking it in the \"Scenes\" field box, once you have the scene highlighted, rightclick the field box under \"Sources\" and select \"Add>Game Capture\". Give a name to the Source, eg. \"LoL Game Window\" and hit OK.\n\n5. In the next window, click the radio button that says \"Select Application\" and Select \"[League of Legends]: League of Legend (™) Client\" from the drop down menu. If its not there, it means that you arnt in-game. DO NOT select the \"[LoL Client]: PvP.net Patcher\" as this is just the client and not the game. \n\n6. Now click OK, no need to worry about the other settings. Now that it is set up you want \"Preview Stream\". At first you should see a Black screen in the preview window, this is fine, all you have to do is go in-game and then alt tab out again and it will refresh.\n\n7. Depending on the BitRate of the video recording, the quality may look crap. To fix this we want to go to settings>Encoding and under Video Encoding adjust the Max BitRate(kb/s) to something roughly 5000-10000, depending on your computers specs. After that, go down to the Video Tab on the right and Set the Base Resolution to your current Screen Resolution. Then, lower, adjust the Scaling to \"None (#### x ####)\".\n\n8. After this is all done, make a quick recording of quality by Pressing the \"Start Recording Button\" on the right hand side of the OBS Window. Adjust setting to make it look smoother after the test.\n\nHope this helps, cause i aint gonna if you have problems.","replies":[{"poster":"Wiggy","date":"2014-12-12T09:37:33.333+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"lol seriously dude, just a name was all i expected from anybody, you've gone above and beyond, thank you very much!","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Kyoukocola","date":"2014-12-12T05:59:17.997+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Try OBS.

OBS does require a bit of setup and getting use to though so keep that in mind.\nHope this helped you!","replies":[]},{"poster":"TrashDonnut","date":"2014-12-12T04:39:40.602+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Fraps.\n\nIf you wanna edit, SonY Vegas Pro.\n\nLoLReplay if you own a PC.","replies":[{"poster":"Wiggy","date":"2014-12-12T06:16:01.058+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"ive actually been playing league on my old hiptop ;)","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Wiggy","date":"2014-12-12T04:30:39.214+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"fraps.. oh my.. i might use fraps while i fap so i can watch myself re-fap on frap... #frapception\n\nthanks for the comment however dude XD","replies":[]},{"poster":"MadLifeJunior","date":"2014-12-12T04:29:32.399+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I've heard people using LoLReplay, LoLRecorder, Fraps, Evolve etc.","replies":[]}]}
