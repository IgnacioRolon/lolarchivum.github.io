But to your second part of the response I feel conflicted. Being a support main I always prioritise sightstone, but that being said as soon as I buy the item my team mates never seem to buy wards themselves.\nWhat you don't understand is that supports need items too! So \"when a support doesn't buy wards it forces other members of the team to buy more wards which could delay their item builds\" is quite selfish IMO. \nBottom line: having sightstone on the support **does not mean** you can neglect purchasing wards yourself.","replies":[{"poster":"SorakaXHealBoT","date":"2015-06-10T15:02:49.088+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"What im trying to say is supports need to prioritise on sightstone and wards to support their teammates.

Sure ADCs and APCs need damage, however it's not always about the big items that change the game but what you do with that gold. Either optimise it by upgrading trinket or simply purchasing a 75 gold ward. A 75 gold ward could mean a pure ace of the enemy team or loss of the game. Sure supports can ward, but what if it expires or taken down? What if all the charges were used and you are going to engage baron? If you insist on saying 75 gold is denying an ADC on his build then your ADC is clearly horrible at farming/utilising his gold. Don't rely on others to ward the map. Have you seen pro Korean/NA players? Do you see how much wards each person buys? That is the difference between good players and bad players. Now in saying this I do agree with the OP about purchasing wards and prioritising {{item:2049}} over nearly any other items but don't rely on others, especially in soloque.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"DiamondAries","date":"2015-06-09T01:32:59.859+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Basically this.
