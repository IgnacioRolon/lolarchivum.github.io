I doubt many people are gonna use that  queue. Also, that would be a person joining a game where they come in 10 minutes after a 4v5 where they do not get to choose there position, character or the basis of their build.\nBasically, it'd be a very undesirable queue that would be super unused.","replies":[{"poster":"Wiggy","date":"2014-12-08T17:42:29.142+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"perhaps it would be un-used, personally id rather see the spot open up the moment somebody disconnects, and if its filled before theyre reconnected they simply dont get to play, although i realize that is unfair hence the 10 min window \n\non top of which i'd love to use that queue, also, it wouldn't be hard to simply display the champions stats etc you're going to be using, an elise with smite, you're jungling bud.\n\nand im yet to see somebody with a better idea, feel free to throw one of those out there, because simply leaving people to lose games based on others disconnecting is not a fair system.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Garens Harem","date":"2014-12-09T06:38:16.960+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"some people can join the 4v5 and troll\nqueue unreliable as fu.ck, what if a bronze player was missing? and the only guy in queue was a diamond ?\n\nriot probs dont want another queue, there is no dominion/TT, why this queue?\n{{champion:79}} {{champion:79}} {{champion:79}} {{champion:79}} {{champion:79}} {{champion:79}} {{champion:79}} {{champion:79}} {{champion:79}} {{champion:79}} {{champion:79}}","replies":[{"poster":"Wiggy","date":"2014-12-09T07:17:45.519+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"if they do that then so be it, if riot actually had a decent system in place to punish people that wouldn't even be an issue, because they'd only get to do it for 2-3 games before being banned. \n\nif the game is silver, only allow bronze/gold to join, if the game is bronze, only allow silver to join etc, this really isn't a hard system to work out nor implement, riot just prefers to pump out champions, skins, and silly new game modes like URF and one for all rather than fix real issues","replies":[{"poster":"Garens Harem","date":"2014-12-09T08:22:47.123+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":">riot probs dont want another queue, there is no dominion/TT, why this queue?\n\nyou forgot to consider this part\n\nAnd riot doesn't have a reliable banning system...yet(hopefully)\nso we won't see any chance of this system being implemented any time soon until we get a bigger population of players ( queus)  and banning system.
