The bot laners brought this up in chat, to which the jungler agreed, and you responded with a derogatory statement.\n- They reported you for not being a team player.\n\nTo me it looks like you ***SHOULD*** have helped out your team. You were the one who was ahead so assisting your team mates, who were obviously struggling, was the most effective way to win the game. Objectives and teamwork win games, not kills and \"winning\" lanes. However, you decided that the only lane that matters is your own, an attitude that this game could very well do without. Quite frankly, I hope you get banned. I'm not saying the other people weren't in the wrong, I don't know what they said specifically or how they acted specifically, but, based on the way you described the situation, it's quite evident that you are in the wrong.","replies":[{"poster":"Wiggy","date":"2015-07-04T10:51:21.354+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"you see though, it's not as easy as \"win top, roam win game\" i couldn't just leave teemo top, like he's gonna sit there and do nothing. and i certainly had absolutely no incentive to roam and help 3 asshats who start throwing BS at me over their mistakes, considering i didn't say anything once the feeding begun, i am absolutely justified to respond, the biggest issue is they can give it but can't take it back.","replies":[{"poster":"Project Xayah","date":"2015-07-04T12:52:32.958+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You don't have to leave him top though.

How can ignoring emails from clients be called anything other than being total ignorant assholes?
