I abuse everyone and sat on a solid 92% win rate in Diamond almost filling into Master before the season ended. The term is angsty-teenagers, which is correct, if a swear word offends you on the internet then you need to reevaluate your life. If you have the language filter off you shouldn't be able to report for offensive language, period.\n\nRiot Lyte is the worst thing to happen to this game since Riot added Riven and didn't fix her obvious animation cancelling allowing her to close gaps on people with no counter play. No matter how many times you chat restrict players or ban them, they are not going to stop abusing people. I am living proof of that. I have received more bans than most people, I'm damn well rivaling XJ9 here. You ban me, I'll just make a new account and stomp new players until I hit thirty, it doesn't bother me.","replies":[{"poster":"kJs","date":"2015-08-07T02:18:35.805+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"You could be an outlier. \nStop abusing people.
