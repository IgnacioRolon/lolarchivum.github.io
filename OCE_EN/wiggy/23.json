Back then it wasn't the beast inside the impenetrable armor (tin can as Garen likes to say) back then Mordekaiser was a wraith still, however he was one of the few beings in existence with the power and the will to protect humanity, and in our early days that is exactly what it did.\r\n\r\nIt was Valorans protector, defending any who could not stand for themselves, never straying from its' path, but like all good things come to an end, so too does evil grow when left unchecked, and as mighty as Mordekaiser is, wraith or no, it was but one. The sad truth is that there was no foul and cruel magics that transformed Mordekaiser, no ritual sacrifice cast against the wraith that protected us, Mordekaiser lost its' spirit.\r\n\r\nIt was not mere chance or on a whim that Mordekaiser suddenly decided to start slaughtering innocents however, it was one of the Darkins greatest accomplishments you see, the protectorate army that Aatrox so valiantly saved was not an army of brave men defending their homeland, it was not an army of fathers brothers and uncles buying their families lives with their own. The protectorate was one of the most vile and hate filled civilizations to ever spread their filth across runterra! they pillaged and stole, murdered for imagined slights and bathed in their power, fighting their way across continents still undiscovered until they came to Valoran.\r\n\r\nThe day they slew the Magelords Mordekaiser was there to defend their city, for they had no warriors, no spells of fire an ice nor energy, an entire civilization built upon peace, one that Mordekaiser seen as a beacon of hope, and an entire civilization wiped out. Mordekaiser had never until that day suffered defeat, it had never had to fear a fight, for what mortal could ever threaten a wraith. But the world is a big place, and the Darkin a dangerous species indeed, and not quite so mortal as humanity,  Mordekaiser was not to know a being so strong that even death itself would not stop it was leading the protectorate however. He knew this warrior with a sword that seemed to be a blight upon the world was dangerous the moment they met, but Mordekaiser never shrank from it's chosen path.\r\n\r\nIt wasn't losing a battle that broke Mordekaiser however, however damaged it's pride (if wraiths can be said to have pride) was i can safely tell you that it was the mass slaughter of an entire civilization right in front of it that twisted its' mind and soul, for the Darkin it writes of (oh yes it does write, quite well too) tied it in the middle of the Magelords city and left it there, it took Mordekaiser days to break free, for Mordekaiser was never bound in the metal armor until after the battle with the foul Darkin, in the days Mordekaiser was trapped inside its' armor and tied inside of the city the cruelty of the world right infront of it twisted its' mind beyond recognition.\r\n\r\nYou ask how i know this? you doubt my credibility, but you should not.. for i am quite the Prodigal explorer and i could not help but to explore this beasts lair, i now have proof of what occured before recorded history.. and a few nice souvenirs and am returning home with haste for i can feel it in the very air that this place is not safe, the shadows seem to cling to me.\r\n\r\n\r\nComments greatly appreciated, i'm aware that it's quite a read i got quite carried away, short stories ftw ;) \r\n\r\nIf  rito did like this it could lead them down quite a storyline concerning aatrox and morde, along with some new lore for ez.\r\n\r\nAll 3 of them could have a new skin too, which would be epic\r\n-Silent as a shadow Ezreal.\r\n-The lighter side Mordekaiser\r\n-Aatrox the cruel.\r\n\r\n{{champion:82}} {{champion:82}} {{champion:82}} {{champion:82}} {{champion:82}} {{champion:82}} {{champion:82}} {{champion:82}} {{champion:82}} {{champion:82}} {{champion:82}} {{champion:82}} {{champion:82}} {{champion:82}} {{champion:82}} {{champion:82}} {{champion:82}} {{champion:82}} {{champion:82}} {{champion:82}} {{champion:82}} {{champion:82}} {{champion:82}} {{champion:82}} {{champion:82}} {{champion:82}}","replies":[{"poster":"BladeSensual","date":"2014-12-11T21:24:03.992+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I like this and I like mordes normal lore.
