You used to be anyway.\n\nWoW has always had a 1 key press, one spell limit on macros.\nThings not on the GCD have always been excepted, so you could macro AP,PoM,Pyro, or NS, Healing Touch to get instant speed spells off in one press. \nAny chains like full DPS rotations have always been limited to cast sequences, where pressing the same button over and over stepped through your rotation, but you needed to press the button each time you wanted to cast a spell.\n\nThe closest thing to an exception to this was there was a mob in Gnomeragon that if you mind controlled it, had a damage spell off the GCD. You could write a macro to cast that spell ~200 times, then another macro to call the 1st macro, and a 3rd macro to call the 2nd ~200 times (loops wouldnt work though). And you could press the button your screen would freeze up for a second and you'd and shoot 10,000 spanners at once, one shotting anything, but it only worked in a low level instance so it wasn't of any practical value.","replies":[{"poster":"KingDinger","date":"2014-12-11T09:47:17.401+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"5 years of playing WOW with an addon for macroing spells into combos and never banned...","replies":[{"poster":"Wiggy","date":"2014-12-11T16:32:16.168+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"i believe what i called a macro many of you consider \"bots\" my apologies for the confusion, i'm not talking about the little macros you get off of curse when i say insta-ban in wow, i'm talking about the 1-90 (or 1-100) leveling/quests bots, i just wasn't sure if riot considered macros and bots to be along the same lines and wouldn't discriminate between the two when banning,\n\neither way ive sent in a ticket asking so its all good :)","replies":[{"poster":"Project Xayah","date":"2014-12-12T00:05:05.778+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Bots are against the TOU/EULA (which you've agreed to in order to play).
