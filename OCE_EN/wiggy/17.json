You'd just lose double the next game, 'cause LP loss is based on MMR (and yeah, you still lose that, we don't want to mess up with rating).\nIt'd shut up a lot of complaints from the guys who don't get how it works... But probably create cases where the same guys think they can abuse the system.\nIdk. People are weird.","replies":[]},{"poster":"ThorsArmy","date":"2015-05-25T06:12:36.171+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Maybe the simple solution is if someone afks' or leaves the game pauses until they come back or until 5 minutes expires. If the person doesn't return other team can then vote andshow mercy, game ends but u don't lose full LP only half of what you would've and the person who left loses full amount of LP. This can still be abused by someone leaving. However mercy system is there incase its genuine or not genuine rage quit/dc. Then they can vote no and you all lose LP.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Niji","date":"2015-05-25T01:38:03.756+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Bad team comp, no worries just take turns afking every time you get a bad comp 1 person losses lp but the other 4 don't...\n\nThis among other reasons is why Riot won't change the way it works, besides it is more likely the enemy team get's an afk as long as you never do yourself.","replies":[]}]}
