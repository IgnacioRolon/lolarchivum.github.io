Seems everything except for SR is hella long. Having an hour plus queue for ascension at the moment. Doesnt seem to be the population, people on my friends list are getting games within a few minutes. Dont think its mmr or anything, 91 wins to 50 loses, so what gives?","replies":[{"poster":"Miicka","date":"2016-10-04T01:39:50.098+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I was waiting in a 2 hour queue not realising that the queue was bugged and my lol client wasn't connected to the Internet.\n\nThe best part of it though was that I had leaverbuster because of my internet issues so I had to wait an extra 40 minutes. Gee thanks for the 3 hour queue Rito ;(","replies":[]},{"poster":"Ing√©nue","date":"2016-10-03T06:54:11.212+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"My best guess would be that everyone is over the rotating game mode queues. Ascension has come around quite a few times and the novelty has worn off. Players are returning to their old SR/ARAM/ranked habits.","replies":[{"poster":"Fierce Ranma","date":"2016-10-03T10:20:57.759+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Its been like this for a few months and my point is its not the same for my other friends. I queue with someone i get a game in 5 minutes, i queue solo and it takes 30+ minutes???","replies":[]}]}]}
