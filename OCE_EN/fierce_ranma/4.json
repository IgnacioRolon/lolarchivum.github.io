While changing up Talisman of Ascension, the Raptor Cloak has been added to the recipe. So, playing hexakill this weekend, turns out it cant be built on TT because raptor cloak isnt allowed. So maybe change up the recipe for it or add some of the banned TT items for hexakill (like thornmail, et al.)","replies":[{"poster":"Buttsubushi","date":"2016-07-03T21:43:11.613+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Haha,  the old Luden's Echo building out of the banned Needless and the old Quilt Coat allowed you to place wards on TT.\nGood times.","replies":[]}]}
