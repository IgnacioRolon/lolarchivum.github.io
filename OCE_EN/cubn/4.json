But my main supports are Thresh, Janna, Blitz and Leona and Morgana. The main 2 I play best on are Thresh and Morgana but if there is any other champions that you&#039;d like to recommend I&#039;d be happy to learn the ins and outs of them. I would say I never rage cause the game is fun and I&#039;ll just laugh cause then you don&#039;t take the game to  heart and you don&#039;t feel bad about yourself. I use all means of communications but I&#039;m not always able to play due to school and work. But please if you are interested add me and I&#039;ll be happy to duo up with you.","replies":[]}
