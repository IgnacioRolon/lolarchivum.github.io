First of all, Merry Christmas and a Happy New Year! Just posting my channel here because I'm wanting to grow and expand more and need your help! My channel has been up for about 6 weeks now and so far I have reached a total of 210 subscribers! But, I want to grow more! I'm looking for someone to help me with GFX and maybe create me an intro and new outro. Possibly even an editor! My channel does commentaries, highlights, montages, the works! Although I'm only Silver ELO, I love the game and I LOVE making videos. So if you're not too busy, come check me out and maybe even subscribe! It helps a lot :) Cheers guys. Decraston :)\r\n\r\nwww.youtube.com/decrastontv","replies":[{"poster":"teri maaaa","date":"2015-09-11T13:03:32.948+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"hey i have my own youtube channel, made it around 5 days ago, https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCqWcjEQQUD9bSsl0PGhffdw\nif you want to do some sort of a collab it works for me :)","replies":[]},{"poster":"AceSlayer","date":"2014-12-25T07:29:29.694+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'd love too help you make you're vidoes/duo with you :)","replies":[]}]}
