I like the Q but the gate gives him no survivability and is useless. you could have lowered the CD, that would have been more impressive. I doubt I'll play this game anymore now and after spending a lot of cash on skins etc, it's really disappointing. I really abhor how changes are made without consultation. Shame on you for ruining the best little mage in the game.","replies":[{"poster":"DiamondAries","date":"2015-02-28T11:58:22.039+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You have got to be joking\n\nThey did not ruin this Yordle of death\n\nThey simply buffed him due to the retraction of the DFG\n\nThe .75 second delay on his stun should not trigger this kind of reaction.\n\nIt's not like they made it a 2 sec delay or anything. It's just .75 sec longer to kill someone now.","replies":[]},{"poster":"RNG Remilia","date":"2015-02-28T00:26:39.213+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Veigarmort,realm=OCE,application-id=Ntey9fRZ,discussion-id=iEE5Xoz2,comment-id=,timestamp=2015-02-27T11:03:21.261+0000)\n>\n> no survivability and is useless. \n\nDo you understand now what it feels like to be playing an AP against a pre-change Veigar?","replies":[]},{"poster":"BarryButcher","date":"2015-02-27T12:22:57.646+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I assume your talking about his E?
