There are also some things classed as no tolerance language (such as 'kys', hate speech, etc) that are generally considered as unacceptable even in the context of a joke. \n\nRegardless, player support can at the very least offer you more context on the punishment.","replies":[{"poster":"Rallick","date":"2019-12-27T01:58:04.033+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"\"There are also some thing classed as no tolerance language (such as 'kys', hate speech, etc) that are generally considered as unacceptable even in the context of a joke.\" \n\nMay i ask why a guy that flamed me multiple times and then threatened to kill my family was not meted out such a punishment? If the guy above gets permabanned for whatever it was he was saying (which could well have offended the other people not involved in the conversation), why didn't the person in my game? \nReported him in game, expected immediate penalty, nothing happened for the next day or two as i watched his op.gg, manually reported as well and was told not to double report. \nSorry but the system obviously doesn't work; quoted the hate speech guidelines, quoted what he had said to me, and absolutely nothing happens. He didn't get a suspension, let alone a permaban. There needs to be more transparency around this system because quite frankly for the majority of the community it feels like the trolls and flamers get protected more than the people copping the abuse.","replies":[{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2019-12-27T02:13:40.137+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":2,"body":"Just because he didn't receive a suspension doesn't mean he wasn't punished. Riot does not reveal *any* information about another player's account to a third party for a whole slew of reasons regarding privacy, witch-hunting, reform, etc, etc.\n\nMore transparency solves some problems but also introduces a whole heap more. Riot has to find the best compromise of providing feedback to reporting players where possible, but also not allowing the community to abuse the information they do provide (as some people inevitably would).\n\nSuch a balancing act has no perfect solution. It just doesn't exist.","replies":[{"poster":"Rallick","date":"2019-12-27T21:18:59.004+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"I'm not saying they didn't receive a penalty, i'm saying the suspension for that sort of abuse, that is clearly stated in the guidelines, did not occur. In the context of this thread where someone got banned for their text logs, for someone who did what happened to me to not receive at least a suspension is inconsistent.\n\nFurthermore the transparency i am speaking of may be better termed consistency; why is it that sometimes a notification is sent when a penalty is issued? Either always send a notification in those situations, or never do. As it currently stands there is always a question mark of was this read? did anything happen? did a penalty get issued but i don't know? The system would be better simply to have a report system and then never get a response issued and know that's how the system works compared to what we have now.\n\nYou're right though, even though there was no suspension for flame, hate speech and threatening people in real life, he may still have received an appropriate punishment.....","replies":[{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2019-12-28T07:56:05.717+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"The guidelines state that such behaviours *can* escalate, not that they necessarily always will. I don't know the specifics of the case so I can't comment much more than that.\n\nIt's generally likely to escalate, but on an account with no negative history, it reduces the chances.\n\nThe notification is consistent, just very limited. There is an argument that it would be better to simply remove it, but there is also value in keeping it.","replies":[{"poster":"Rallick","date":"2019-12-29T02:55:39.638+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"lol ok, this conversation is pointless.\n\nI'm glad you feel someone making the comments i stated and not receiving some form of suspension penalty is appropriate. \n\nI have pointed out what this guy in the thread said, compared to what was said in my game, and the lack of consistency between the penalties of the two, as also evidenced across numerous threads across numerous years. To then be defending the system in the face of these issues is laughable and again makes me wonder why i bother to comment on these posts and ask questions of the system when Riot very clearly is not concerned with actually making changes or improvements to a toxic environment. \n\nApologies to DianaHole for the way the thread went.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"ItzSwane","date":"2020-01-06T23:15:51.365+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Looking at your name..
