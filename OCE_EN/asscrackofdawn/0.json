I've had so many wait times after \"dodging games\" simply because the client freezes before joining games or just wont let me click shit at all. I've spent hours just trying to log into the client (need to close all background league process repeatedly). Like man, I just wanna play this stupid game with some mates. Shouldn't be this hard. There was nothing wrong with the last client, it worked fine and looked great. Just fucking revert it.\r\n\r\nFirst and hopefully last forum post.","replies":[{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2019-10-03T13:58:55.831+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"There doesn't seem to be any widespread drama, so you could have experienced a bad patch or some such.\n\nI'd recommend running a client repair and see if that fixes things, failing that, I'd recommend contacting support: https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/requests/new","replies":[]}]}
