So whenever a person gets airborne by my teammates or by my Q tornado, i **sometimes** cant ult. So whenever im like in laning phase and when i get level 6 and then solo all in, i can ult clean and perfectly. But when in teamfights even with my own tornado, i cant ult. Its not that im not spamming OR im spamming, i do whatever but i just cant ultimate with him sometimes which mostly happens in crucial teamfights that costs us the game because i did not ult. I sent one ticket to riot, and then they responded to create a discussion here about the problem.\r\nThank you","replies":[{"poster":"CHEESYLEEKS","date":"2017-04-26T05:02:35.197+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"solution, stop playing yasuo.\n\nmaybe your out of range, do the indicators come up.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Lord Sesshomaru","date":"2017-04-26T05:20:54.677+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"What I want to know, is why his ult cant be stopped!\n\n90% of the time, Yasuo is just a waste of CC. \nPity thats the only way to kill him....","replies":[{"poster":"Talon12","date":"2017-04-26T06:44:15.343+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Cleanses stop his ult.

They might stop his animation, but the damage happens regardless.\n\nSecondly basically every other ultimate that is a prolonged action (e.g. spends an amount of time performing the action, and is often unable to cast, move or attack during it.) is stopped by CC that prevents casting.\n\nKatarina, Karthus, Lucian, Caitlin, Galio, Jhin, Malzahar, Miss Fortune, Poppy, Ryze, Shen, Taliyah, Twisted Fate, Vel'Koz, Warwick, (to name a few.)\n\nAll of those can be stopped by any CC that prevents casting.\nYasuo's can only be prevented by the hardest of CC (knockups, suppressions etc), and even then, the damage still happens anyway.\nSo tell me again how **Yasuo's isn't harder to stop** than those? cos I'm just not seeing it. \nDo the maths, it takes less kinds of CC to stop his ult than it does to stop everyone else's, so by definition alone it is harder to stop.\n\nThe only other champs I can think of who's ultimates are not stopped by hard CC is Ezreal and Lux (god only knows why).","replies":[{"poster":"Talon12","date":"2017-04-27T04:00:22.799+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Jinx's ult isnt stopped, and yes yasuo's ult damage does still go off, but the cc of the spell is cancelled, his ult is less abut the damage is does because that is quite low unless he is really far ahead, it is abut the cc and utility it provides afterwards. Yasuo only does damage afterwards because of the code it uses, when he was first being designed they tried to make it also cancel the damage, but that caused him to be stuck in his ult animation until he died, he also didn't gain his penetration passive which is the (main point of the ult anyway), and unlike every other ult in the game, he needs specific circumstances to ult.\n\nAnd every form of cc that stops a Lucian ult will also stop a yasuo ult, other than a stun (which is a bug).","replies":[{"poster":"Lord Sesshomaru","date":"2017-04-27T10:37:41.825+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Jinx's ult isn't a sustained action, its a normal skillshot cast. It falls under the same category as Ezreal and Lux.\n\nAnd Yasuo **does** keep his armour penetration even if his ultimate is interrupted by a knockup, (which like you say, is the main part of his ult).\n\nWhat I want to know, is why Yasuo is allowed to still do damage AND gain his armour penetration even after having his ultimate interrupted. When all the other champions I mentioned, lose everything if interrupted. _(and why his ult is harder to interrupt)_\n\nThere is no reason for Yasuo's ultimate to be an exception.\n\nAnd I don't see the relevance of you mentioning Lucians ult? you're saying: \nYasuo's is exactly the same as Lucians, **EXCEPT** for the fact that it isn't stopped by the main source of CC that is supposed to stop it?\n\nSooo in other words... its a lot harder to stop?\nYea mate... they're basically identical...\n\nA bug?\nplease provide proof that it is a bug. \nBecause I feel like a stun not stopping an ability that is supposed to be stopped by a stun, is a bug that Riot would fix very very quickly. and as far as i know, its been that way since his release.\n\nSo unless you can provide proof from a Riot post that it IS indeed a bug, that excuse \njust wont fly.","replies":[{"poster":"Talon12","date":"2017-04-28T06:29:25.977+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Let me lay out the simplicity of it because you need glasses or can't open your eyes.\n\nJinx was an example of an ult you cant stop, because you only named ez and lux.\n\nHe does keep his penetration, but the whole meaning of the text went over your head. \n>do damage AND gain his armour penetration\n\nAs the majority of my previous post explained, you're just oblivious. If his ult didn't do damage, he got stuck in a catatonic state (due to a bug, (which a STUN still causes (would have to remake him to fix it, which they arent bothered) that issue, thus stuns don't affect its duration like all the other hard cc) this bug was caused by him not doing his damage, meaning he got stuck in his ult animation (also unfixable unless remade, and seeing as they just released him they weren't going to take down their money grab for over 1/2 a year) so to fix this, they made small changes which made cc cancel his ult duration and cc, but inorder to stop him getting stuck they let the damage do anyway (oh no 200 damage such damage) and give his passive, which as i said is the main reason he wants to ult anyway.\n\nAnd lucian was a comparison by cc, his ult can be stopped nearly every single way yasuo's can.\n\nFinally, what the fuck is your problem with yasuo, he isn't and issue like a lot of the other champs in the game, he is easily beaten by everything that has a brain anyway. Is it just because youre thick? Nearly every1 else has stopped complaining about him.","replies":[{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2017-04-28T07:27:22.224+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"To clarify, he's not a moderator.","replies":[{"poster":"Talon12","date":"2017-04-28T09:23:40.908+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"He is purple same thing, to clarify, he thinks he is special and the smartest guy alive because he is all colourful","replies":[{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2017-04-28T09:48:44.602+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Everyone's entitled to their opinions, and you're both pretty much denying each other.

I highly doubt you are going to be agreeing anytime soon and it's devolving into and argument rather than a discussion which is productive for noone.\n\nPersonally I hate Yasuo, he's annoying to verse and inevitably attracts more toxics because of the playstyle, but I don't think he's broken, maybe just a little too snowbally.

Yasuo's ult is rather unique in that department in that the effect time is sort of interruptable (since the effect is reliant on him not being a little squirrel thing) but the ability has technically already cast.\n\nIt's messy as far as consistency is concerned but there isn't much they could do to make it consistent (like say making him untargetable in his ult) that wouldn't either gut his ult or make it actually broken OP. It would mean a lot of tweaking to the rest of his kits balance which would likely drastically change the playstyle. Though maybe they could go the route of the only thing that stops it is death but any hard cc cast on him in reduces the damage or something.\n\nReally the counter to his ult isn't trying to cancel it but rather damage mitigation on those in it. Lulu for example is a solid counter to champs like Yas and Zed cause her ult counters theirs pretty directly.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Talon12","date":"2017-04-28T23:20:43.255+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"His ult was coded in such a way that a stun would screw over his whole ult and cause a catatonic state which causes Yasuo to get stuck in the air unable to do anything, but he cant seem to accept that.\n\nHe also keeps trying too argue that yasuo's ult is a channel which it is not, it is instant cast, but unlike say a naut ult, yasuo is affected by the same cc as the people he is ulting.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Łæoña","date":"2017-04-26T12:48:14.411+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Maybe its either spamming the abilities so fast that the ult may not queue up.
