The shop window will be resized back to default, items will be on normal cast and the quickbind UI will have been enabled. I&#039;ve been fine with changing these back to what I like because it&#039;s quite easy to do but today I&#039;ve had a few issues with my camera that I can not figure out. \r\n\r\nNormally I play with a locked camera and if I click and hold on the minimap my camera will snap to that location and allow me to drag around viewing the map and then snap back to my champion when I let go of the mouse button. This hasn&#039;t been working for me at all today. I tried playing without a locked camera but I still couldn&#039;t click on the minimap and have my camera snap to that location, I had to hold my mouse at the edges of the screen to slowly scroll across the map. Additionally, the scroll wheel hasn&#039;t been working in any menu at all.\r\n\r\nI&#039;ve found it really hard to play the game with these issues so I would really appreciate some help.","replies":[{"poster":"SephirothSG","date":"2016-12-11T01:10:00.346+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey there,\n\nCould you try the following to reset your configuration to default.\n\n* Login to the client (which syncs your settings with the server)\n* Go to C:\\Riot Games\\League of Legends\\Config\n* Delete the \"PersistedSettings.json\", \"game.cfg\" & \"input.ini\" files.\n* Launch a custom game\n* Exit the custom game\n* Exit the client","replies":[{"poster":"SpoongeLord","date":"2016-12-14T02:09:11.643+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Perfect!
