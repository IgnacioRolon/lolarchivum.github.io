Just a reminder not to buy boosts, as it's against Riot TOS and is bad for the integrity of the game. This video was made for entertainment purposes only.","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ST18SLcX9M0","image":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/ST18SLcX9M0/hqdefault.jpg"},"up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"So at the very start of the video he clearly explains how he's paid for the boosting. In his description it says, \"just a reminder not to buy boosts, as it's against Riot TOS and is bad for the integrity of the game.  This video was made for entertainment purposes only.\" But what I fail to understand is that out of all those games he played and got boosted on, the opponents he went up against still lost LP at the end of the day. Is this not a bannable offense? Regardless of your intentions, which in this case was making a video for entertainment purposes only, he still boosted, and people still lost LP. I hope that I can get a clear explanation from a moderator. My fear is that since this youtuber is clearly famous, he is exempt from the ban hammer. Another thing is, this is not the first time he's made this type of video. He's done the very same thing before, and posted it on Youtube for the same purpose.","replies":[{"poster":"XtremeGaming4","date":"2019-12-07T12:52:26.834+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hi there Sir,\n\nI would like to point out that _**\"Duo Boosting\"**_ is technically allowed under the summoners code! Whilst it may seem unfair, boosting isn't against the Summoners Code. Riot will only ban it if you are ACCOUNT SHARING. \n\nI do hope you understand this and I apologise that it may have been seen to be unjust it is completely allowed. Whilst I do not suggest doing this I do however suggest that you look at all the other possible entertainment options available to you in my Silver Ranked games!\n\nI do wish you all the best for getting Justice on people like this! \n\n {{sticker:garen-swing}}","replies":[]}]}
