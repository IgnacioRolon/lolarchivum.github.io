Especially new players who just want to learn and play to get to the point they can say they&#039;re Daimond, gold, masters or what ever it may be, to feel accomplished, obviously if i thought I was any good i would play ranked but I have not once touched ranked because I know for a fact people would be so toxic to me and I&#039;m still learning I&#039;m not the type of person to played a ranked game mode untill I reach a point i&#039;m happy in my preference thank you to those who have read this far and I would like to hear your feed back and maybe some positive feedback to make me want to keep trying to learn lee sin... I really really reallly do wany to get good with lee sin...","replies":[{"poster":"Akkordian Zoeve","date":"2017-03-07T02:20:49.901+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I reckon the toxicity is even worse for a jungler, since not only do they yell at you for your mistakes, but they blame their mistakes on you as well :(\n\nJust had a game where my teammates inted under tower several times, and blamed it on me.","replies":[{"poster":"dragon poo","date":"2017-03-07T08:12:01.514+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Percival9,realm=OCE,application-id=T8eq2lFQ,discussion-id=sj0VOfN3,comment-id=0000,timestamp=2017-03-07T02:20:49.901+0000)\n>\n> I reckon the toxicity is even worse for a jungler, since not only do they yell at you for your mistakes, but they blame their mistakes on you as well :(\n> \n> Just had a game where my teammates inted under tower several times, and blamed it on me.\n\njungle and support are the wost roles for being fglamed at. you expect the mid laner to be an idiot, and the adc to just die 1v5. but if you are jungler, or support you have to be perfect.","replies":[]}]}]}
