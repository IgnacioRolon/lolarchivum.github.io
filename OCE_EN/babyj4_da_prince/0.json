Makes me wonder, if I always get banned for responding to them how the fuck are they not getting banned as well? How come people can talk shit to me but if I talk shit back IM THE ONLY ONE THAT GETS BANNED? Once again, fuck you RIOT, I cant believe the shitshow this game and company have turned into. RIP to the nice game, community, and company LOL used to be in its early stages. RIOT purposely has a broken ban system so they can make more money, otherwise they would only ban people who are truly deserving of it, and we all know there are plenty of them that play this. It sucks that this is still one of the more popular games out there because its obviously ran by a rotten company that doesnt care about their playerbase and only cares about money.","replies":[{"poster":"Broken Scripts","date":"2019-11-26T02:26:36.770+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Just soft int them.\n\nOpen up steam, start downloading games, ping your ping and say that you're lagging.\n\nThat or just AFK.
