This is mainly due to the integrated graphics card mac uses which only comes with a very very small fan and heat sink. Games that require rendering will put stress on the card and cause it to heat up.\n\nSolution: \n• Get a good laptop cooler base. Something with lots of fans that are directed to the upper part of your laptop.\n• Also download SMC fan control (don't worry its not a malware with virus). This program allows you to toggle your fan settings to help with more heat disipation.","replies":[{"poster":"Wuks","date":"2015-11-30T06:44:53.863+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You may also want to bring your laptop into Apple if it becomes more of an issue.
