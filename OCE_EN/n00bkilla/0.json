The time was 6:30:23:163 pm, I should know of all people. I was with the lost children of Zaun, my friends. They are all abit, you know, rough. However they were the only ones I had. \r\n\r\nCrescent yelled out &ldquo;Vi and Caitlyn look like they are waiting up ahead what should we do Ekko?&rdquo;\r\n\r\n Crescent was a pale girl, with a slim body and pearly white hair that covered her left eye with a flick, but don&rsquo;t let that fool you, what she lacked in body mass she sure made up in agility she was the most nimble person I knew being able to get out of almost any situation with her quick words and intense speed. This particular night she was wearing hear silver cloak, her black jeans and metallic t-shirt.\r\n\r\nI swiftly replied &ldquo;C&rsquo;mon Cres&rsquo; you know you don&rsquo;t need me to know what to do&hellip;&rdquo;\r\n\r\nShe flashed a smile and answered, &ldquo;Yeah, had a lot of practice while you were in the League,&rdquo;\r\n\r\nWe all kept dashing across the rooftops, and gliding through the streets as we used to do and completely jumped straight over the narrow street Crescent had spotted Caitlyn and Vi. The chase was on. \r\n\r\nCaitlyn yelled out in that irritating accent of hers &ldquo;Ekko stop now, I won&rsquo;t go easy on you out here like I did in the League!&rdquo;\r\n\r\nI quickly retorted &ldquo;Haha, you didn&rsquo;t stand a chance against me, I would one-shot you before you even said &lsquo;Do you want to see a hat trick&rsquo;.&rdquo; I used the same irritating accent she has to say that last statement.\r\n\r\nAdding on to what I said before &ldquo;Vi you can&rsquo;t get me now without your, summoner pointing and clicking on me, and I can&rsquo;t move&rdquo; \r\n\r\nThe two police officers chased us, up and down Zaun, and we couldn&rsquo;t lose them. Where every we went they knew, we took every shortcut we knew. But we had done this before and it wasn&rsquo;t our first time running from these people\r\n\r\nAzure yelled &ldquo;Damn, these chicks won&rsquo;t shake,&rdquo;\r\n\r\nI calmly said &ldquo;I know how to lose them but you won&rsquo;t like it.&rdquo;\r\n\r\nThe whole group simultaneously yelled &ldquo;DO IT!!!&rdquo;\r\n\r\nI we kept jumping from roof to roof and suddenly I saw the point that would set us free from these obsessed law enforcement officers.\r\nI told my bunch to quickly follow me as I led them down a narrow staircase and into an abandoned warehouse. \r\n\r\nWe saw the two clueless officers run past and we all started puffing out hearts out with relief, all of us filled with adrenaline.\r\n\r\nAll of sudden, we hear a mad cackle and all my friends had been snatched up into a massive re-enforced steel before my very eyes, I could react it happened so fast.\r\n\r\nCrescent asked me with fear in her voice making it shaky&rdquo; Whe-Where are we Ek-Ekko?&rdquo;\r\n\r\nThe answer to her question came shortly after.\r\n\r\nA wild chilling voice replied &ldquo;My home of course silly-billy, did Ekko show you my new place&rdquo; she continued by saying &ldquo;Wanna know how I got the keys&rdquo; A mad cackle filled the warehouse &ldquo;I pried them from the cold hands of the dead owner&rdquo;\r\n\r\nIt was Jinx, the Loose Cannon.\r\n\r\nJinx was kinda of a friend, but yet she was extremely unreliable.\r\n\r\nI sighed and asked &ldquo;Jinx please let them go, they&rsquo;re cool&rdquo; \r\n\r\nShe replied with a hint of insanity in her voice &ldquo;They know where I live though, I don&rsquo;t know if I can?&rdquo;\r\n\r\nAzure yelled out to me &ldquo;How do you know this nutjob man&rdquo;\r\n\r\n&ldquo;What can I say, I met a lot of people in the League,&rdquo; I calmly replied\r\n\r\nJinx immediately took offense to this &ldquo;A NUTJOB YOU RECKON, I&rsquo;LL SHOW YOU A NUTJOB!&rdquo; She took aim with her cannon at the cage and mumbled &ldquo;Bye, bye&rdquo;\r\n\r\nI quickly looked into the eyes of my terrified friends all looking at me in their final moment and I knew immediately what I had to do. Well it was just a day in my life in Zaun.\r\n\r\nIt was 6: 30:23:163 pm&hellip;","replies":[]}
