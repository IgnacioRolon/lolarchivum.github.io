I feel as if my choices of tanky supports is lacking so I thought that I may as well just see if I could do anything about it. After discovering this forum here I decided to make a plan for my ideal tanky support (not op of course). So, the idea for the character came from a Japanese story of a Shinigami (Grim Reaper/Death Spirit) that would protect human souls. This came to be as a great idea for a support. A support champion based of death/grim reaper concept? Isn&#039;t that meant to be Thresh? Trust me, I have taken the precautions to not be the same. \r\n\r\n&gt; **Character Design**\r\nMamoru wields a scythe, rather typical I know, but wait till you see the cool stuff you can do with it. \r\n\r\n&gt; **Abilities**\r\nPassive - Judgement Stance/Protection Stance\r\nThis passive changes Mamoru&#039;s combat stance according to his health percentage. While above 50% health Mamoru will assume Judgment Stance with his scythe raised. This stance will give his abilities more offensive capabilities, such as less severe CC and damage aura for his allies. While on the other hand when below 50% he will assume Protection Stance and hold the down downwards. During this stance he will have lost his offensive capabilities on his ability passives and gain more severe CC and armor/magic resist auras for allies. These buff specs will be shown in the abilities.\r\n\r\n&gt; Q - Swipe / Active\r\nMamoru raises his scythe and swipes it in front of him, dealing area of effect damage in front of him in a cone and applying a Stance effect. \r\nDealing: =60/100/140/180/220 damage\r\nRange - ?? Will need testing\r\nAttack Damage Scaling = 0.6\r\nMana Cost: =60/85/100/125/150\r\nCooldown =8/7/6/5/4 seconds\r\nJudgement Stance - Deals an extra =40/85/100/125/150 to enemy champions\r\nProtection stance - Enemy Champions hit will have their movement speed slowed by =10/15/20/25/30% \r\n\r\n&gt; W - Soul Transfer / Active\r\nMamoru being a Death Spirit is naturally immortal, and having mastery over souls, can share his with an ally granting them mana at the expense of his health. \r\nMana given: =40/60/90/120/170\r\nRange - ?? Will need testing\r\nAbility Power Scaling = 0.3\r\nHealth Cost: = 5%/6%/8%/10%/12% of maximum health\r\nCooldown =12/10/8/7/6\r\nJudgement Stance - Ally targeted has a triple shot\r\nProtection Stance - Ally targeted also gains equal amount of mana given in health\r\n\r\n&gt; E - The Reapers Presence / Passive Aura Toggle\r\nMamoru&#039;s presence distill&#039;s a fear into his enemies and makes his allies glad they are with him using his intimidating presence.\r\nAllies gain = 0.3/0.8/1/2.5/5 health regen per 10\r\nEnemies lose = 5/10/15/20/25 armor/mr\r\nRange - ?? Will need testing\r\nMana Cost =10/15/20/30/40 per second\r\nCooldown 3 seconds at all stages\r\nJudgement Stance - Allies gain 20 movespeed\r\nProtection Stance - Allies gain a 100/150/200/280/350 point shield once in combat when Mamoru falls below 50%\r\n\r\n&gt; R - Reaper&#039;s Slash / Active\r\nMamoru dashes forward holding his scythe out to either side of himself (which ever side the cursor is) to damage and root on up to 3 enemies and slowing the rest\r\nDamage =150/250/350\r\nRoot Duration =1.5/2/2.5 seconds\r\nSlow amount and duration =30%/50%/70% for 2/4/6 seconds \r\nRange - ?? Will need testing\r\nMana cost =150/200/350\r\nCooldown =100/80/60 seconds.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nProbably won&#039;t read this, but ya know\r\nPlease I am open to suggestions and constructive criticism\r\nIm outies","replies":[{"poster":"A Modern Hippy","date":"2015-06-17T06:57:24.763+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I love the concept. Your logic behind the construction is understandable, and you've definitely fulfilled the promise to make it far different from our over-loved support king Thresh.\n\nI love the passive idea. It's something that is original, with nothing like it in League, but also easily implementable. I can see it in game, and the benefits and problems associated with it.\n\nThe Q is ok, not particularly inventive but reliable and true. To be clear, it's like a Hecarim W with a longer CD, higher base damage and with the stance effects, correct?\n\nI like the W. Taking Soraka's current healing ability and adapting it for mana is a good move, especially with the addition of potential healing with his passive.\n\nHis E sounds like it would be a little more difficult to juggle than his others. Both things are pretty important, but also both very situational. Falling below 50% hp when trying to chase down a kill isn't exactly convenient, and the same in that giving a MS boost when your carry is locked down by the enemy support isn't all that helpful. Perhaps if you replaced his Q or W with a spammy low damage skill that costs Health and deals damage in Judgement, and then heals and provides a tiny speed boost in Protection, it would allow the player to better control his stances and so be a more reliable support.\n\nNow, the R. I feel like it's a bit of a cross between a Sion ult and a Hecarim ult, charging in a direction applying CC to enemies hit, correct me if I'm wrong. I feel like it would be more effective and also more in character if he did something like this;\n\n> R - Reaper's Intent/Active\nMamoru singles out an opponent and marks them for death. Allied champions' attacks and abilities against the marked target deal bonus magic damage, steal MS and heal the attacker for a percentage of Mamoru's maximum HP.\nBonus Magic Damage = 100/175/250\nAP Scaling = 0.4\nMark Duration = 5/10/15 seconds\nMS Steal = 5/10/15% MS for 2 seconds\nRange = ??\nMana Cost = 100/200/300\nCD = 180/140/100 seconds\n\nOverall, I love the idea. Thumbs up.\n\n\n\nAlso, if you feel so inclined, check out my own concepts and help me out with them. ^_^\n\nhttp://boards.oce.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/player-creations/n2AHLjAn-champion-concepts-by-a-modern-hippy","replies":[{"poster":"TinyHobo","date":"2015-08-17T12:54:27.294+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Cheers pal, I threw this together in about an hour or so. I wanted to look at him as more of a teamfight support. I hate it when I am support that I normally lose alot of my fighting ability when I have 5 enemies to peel of my carries. I see you idea and I think it is probably a good plan to make him much more agressive in team fights. I wonder what could happen in I got to sit down with a team to design champs over a week or so.\n\nAlso, I'll check em out.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"sparklefart","date":"2015-06-12T01:52:40.283+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":">hold the down downwards.","replies":[]}]}
