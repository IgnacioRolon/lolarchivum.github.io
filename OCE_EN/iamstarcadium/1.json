Its my personal opinion so don't flame. My proposal for the new ranked/LP system is that to become ranked, you complete a test of your individual mechanics. This would include CS ability with autos only and although it would be hard to assess, your positioning for each role in the game. My alternative for the current LP system, is that if you end the game with a good K/D/A score, you gain LP. You would need to have assists so that people couldn't just KS and gain LP. If you win the game you gain LP regardless but receive bonus LP for having a good score.\r\nI Also suggest a way to reset your profile to unranked by either completing a number of hours in normals or by paying a great deal of IP and not RP so that people cannot buy their way to diamond. This is just a suggestion because today i have quit the game because of my frustration to the current LP/Ranked system.{{item:3070}}","replies":[{"poster":"Zero Infinity","date":"2015-02-28T06:55:10.172+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The issue with this I believe is that so many people are willing to surrender a game at the drop of a hat already.\nThis would just give them an extra incentive. \nPeople, especially the team behind, would play to protect KDA's, not winning, I think this is a bad mentality. \n\nImproving your KDA should be something you innately achieve for anyway.","replies":[]}]}
