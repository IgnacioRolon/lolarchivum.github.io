I see a ton of discussions about how to be a better player/win games, with no real essence to any of the advice given in the replies. In this discussion I will list some tips I have found useful and break down each of them to a level that everyone should be able to understand. As with anything I am open to constructive criticism if you feel any of tips are flawed or could be different, trolls will be met with a young lol and a golf clap.\n\nso without further adieu, here we go\n\nIRONFIST&#039;s Tips to Success in League of Legends (Specifically for but not restricted to: RANKED SOLO QUEUE)\n\n**1. Have a great attitude, and maintain that attitude throughout the entire Match.**\nFrom the moment you sit down at your computer chair and load up the client, you need to be in a positive state of mind (if you want to increase your chance of winning) if your having a bad day and want to play some LoL to wind down by all means do so, but play normal&#039;s, don&#039;t risk your LP until you are completely over what ever negative events that may have happened in your day. Having a negative attitude going in to a game makes you more susceptible to flaming your team mates when they make a mistake, which can lead to a full blown argument that usually lasts the duration of the match which then in turn distracts your from the overall goal of winning the game (we have all been there before, getting killed while typing, arguing with a team mate while the enemy steals dragon or a tower etc) Don&#039;t ever get baited into a full blown argument over something menial like first blood or failure to call MIA, this will only affect your focus and demoralize your team (In a nutshell, Don&#039;t play ranked if you are shitty), which leads me to my next point...\n\n**2. Be and Stay 110% focused on the current game you are playing**\nWhatever happened in your last game has no place in your current game. You need to be focused on your current game you are playing if you want to win. If you get queued with someone who fed or trolled last game there is two options you can take in the champ select, you can either dodge (provided you accept taking the hit and queue ban for it) or you can go into the game with a brand new mindset focused solely on winning the game (Mute the troll if need be). Limit your distractions outside of the game, I have two sons and a fiance&#039;, I let them know that while I am playing a ranked match I would like to not be disturbed as much as possible for the duration of the match, I turn my phone off, close all other tabs/windows i have open (excluding my music playlist). By doing this you know exactly why your here and what you are doing (to win the match by playing to the best of my ability). \n\n**3. Play champions you know off the back of your hand**\nIt has been said a million times before, ONLY PLAY CHAMPIONS YOU KNOW HOW TO PLAY. A common mistake i have seen time and time again is one of my team mates quickly searching a counter pick during the champ select and locking in that champ without the faintest idea of how the counter pick actually works and then proceed to get dominated in lane. In my experience the biggest counter to an enemy champion is to know the strengths and weaknesses of your own champion and what you are capable of doing at all stages of the game. If the enemy suspects you have no idea what you are doing either by searching how many games you have played with that champ or watching you use you abilities incorrectly, that gives him a psychological advantage over you, he becomes more confident and proceeds to be a lot more effective in pulling off clutch plays to get ahead. Be smart about your itemization don&#039;t just build your same old build or whats recommended every game all the time. Some early defensive items if you are behind can go a very long way when it comes to transitioning into team fights, vice versa if you are ahead, build items that will allow you to increase your lead (not just keep it ie: snowballing). Try to wait for your opponent to use his abilities before you use your&#039;s (this can sometimes be forgiven if you have a considerable lead), You will usually come off on top if you wait for you opponent to miss a skill shot, or waste an ability on CS, a good opponent will know this too, be wary of using your abilities unnecessarily.\n\n**4. The Game is not over until the nexus is destroyed and NEVER under any circumstance vote yes to a Surrender.**\nGames are not lost at the champ select, nor is it lost at first blood, don&#039;t ever type gg because you got outplayed in lane. I cannot stress how important it is to play until the nexus is destroyed, games can be thrown at any point of the game even if you or your opponent have a considerable lead. This can be true if your on the team that is ahead as well. Time and time again I see people throw their leads because they are fed and think they can 1v5 (even 1v3 for that matter). I don&#039;t care if your a 21/0 Yasuo with full build DO NOT engage the enemy if there is more than 2 present its not worth the risk if you die, the best thing you can do is to stay with your team and engage the enemy as a team, your lead will be more useful in that situation. On the flip side, I understand that huge leads can be daunting and demoralizing if you are on the losing side, but NEVER surrender in ranked, If you surrender you lose out on any opportunity (which is not always guaranteed to happen but believe me they do happen) of turning the game around and winning. Besides, if a loss seems inevitable, make them work for it, don&#039;t just hand it to them.\n\n**5. Keep a cool head!**\nA spin off of keeping a great attitude for the duration of the match. Keeping a cool head can be applied to just about all situations during a game,  You have just been outplayed by your opposite, instead of raging, figure out what you did wrong, come back to lane with that knowledge, its OK to make mistakes, its not OK to repeat those mistakes over and over again, google the definition of insanity. We all know how hectic a team fight can be sometimes and its very easy to just mash all your buttons and hope for the best but I&#039;ve found going in to a team fight with clear objective in mind tends to pay off, for example, we have all seen the zed who ult&#039;s the leona instead of reserving his ult for the squishy vayne, or lux, we have all seen the Blitzcrank who cant help but pull that alistar right into knockup range of his own adc, don&#039;t be these guys, think to yourself, I can blow up the enemy carry in one combo lets not waste my Zed ult on leona because she is closest to me, If I (blitzcrank) pull that alistar, hes gonna walk right to my adc, knock him up and send him flying back to the enemy side of the lane. In a nutshell, no matter how excited you get, don&#039;t do stupid shit. In a situation where there is serious flaming going on, do not take part, you will only fuel the fire and decrease your chance of winning the game, instead try to calm your team mates, if that fails just mute the lot of them. Also an important observation i have made: Criticism (No matter how constructive) is often met with a negative attitude 8 times out of 10. Best bet is to just keep quiet and carry on.\n\n**6. Objectives Win Games**\nThis one speaks for itself. Whilst kills are nice, and give you gold to buy nice items (which increase you chance of winning games), kills do not directly win games, Objectives (turrets and inhibitors in particular) do. My priority list during a game looks something like this, Creep Score &gt; Turrets/Inhibitors &gt; Dragon &gt; Kills &gt; Baron. It could be argued that dragon has priority over turrets as they are always present on the map, where as dragon is not, plus the sooner you kill him the sooner he respawns and be available for you to kill him again. that does not mean to say I don&#039;t take kills when they are on (for example my jungler comes to gank) but they are lower on my priority list than the other objectives. This is the most effective priority in my opinion but never restrict yourself to it, games are dynamic with a lot of different variables at any given time which may require you to switch priorities, turrets and inhibs should always be near the top in any situation though. If your playing jungle, and you gank bot or mid and get a kill, take turret (or get as much damage as you can) then prep dragon (wards), and take if possible. this applies to laners aswell, if you get a kill push to turret, take if possible, then signal your jungle for Dragon. On a side note, there is an aspect i believe that is definitely worth a mention, minion tax. Minion tax is when your jungle comes to gank (successful or not) and then proceeds to take a few CS for his effort. I for one have no problem with minion tax I believe if i pay tax i get ganks, but i have been in many games where a team mate (particularly the adc) will throw a hissy fit at his jungle for taking cs, if you are jungle and see a spam of pings to gtfo when taking cs, just bail and leave lane, most of these people will threaten to afk over a few cs its not worth the loss. If you are the person who complains about this be aware that if you jungle has just secured a kill for you and you just went base to shop instead of pushing to the turret, know that he is doing you a favor by denying cs to your opponent and possibly taking tower.\n\n**7. Map Awareness**\nIf you have been playing the game for a while you will already know that map awareness plays a key part in winning games. Although there are people out there who believe map awareness limits itself to just warding and vision. This isn't entirely true. Having vision is but a portion of the overall Map Awareness, other aspects consist of USING that vision you have. if the enemy jungle is around the botlane and your playing adc, do your team a favor and let them know he is there or at the very least ping it. This lets your other lanes know they have a bit of freedom and can engage/trade without the threat of the enemy jungle coming to spoil the party. Speaking of ping's, make a concious effort to call/ping MIA whenever your opponent cannot be seen (This is one i get caught out on a bit). Even if you get a kill and think \"I don't need to call MIA he's dead.\" Let your team know, they may have missed the kill announcement and the last thing they will be expecting (and you for that matter) is for your top lane opponent to pop up in their lane while they are over pushed, this is particularly true if your opponent has teleport. Not only that but some people get real salty if they get ganked and you didn't call MIA, y'know the usual \"gg im done no MIA im AFK\". Yes, you all know it happens so lets just call MIA.\n\nHere are some questions to ask yourself before and during a match, and what my response would be if I were there to answer it:\n\n**I'm not feeling 100% today, should I play some ranked?**\n_No definitely not, play some ARAM or normal rift instead!_\n\n**FFS I just got queued with the Riven from last game that got beat hard in lane then continued to troll our entire team and went 0/12, Should I play this game?**\n_No, take the hit and dodge, you lose less LP in most cases and will give you a break to cool down before your next game, unless of course you cannot afford to dodge ie: promo's, Just mute them and play your best_\n\n**I'm ahead in Lane, what should I do?**\n_Use your lead to your advantage, Help your other team mates out, take turret, Itemize effectively and shut the game out ASAP_\n\n**I'm behind in lane, what should I do?**\n_Be patient, ping for assistance and wait for your jungle to help, if the jungle isn't coming or refuses to, try and make a play elsewhere on the map, roam if you have to, otherwise just CS and wait for transition to mid game_\n\n**I keep losing trades against my opponent, what can I do?**\n_analyse what's happening in the trade, are you missing your skillshots or using your abilities prematurely? if so, try something new, be less predictable, if all else fails, don't engage in a trade at all_\n\nThere are a few other things i would like to cover but as I am about to leave work and have been progressively adding to this post throughout the course of the day I will have to post for now and edit/add aspects at a later stage. please if you have anything constructive to add comment below i still have things to learn about the game, I hope  helps you gameplay by shedding some light on certain aspects you may have overlooked.\n\nIf you wish to discuss more about anything or want to tee up for a game add me in game, I am always willing to learn/help other people. Toxicity in OCE is a real problem and I want to make a difference, If you are the same, then lets brainstorm.\n\nCheers Guys and Gals.","replies":[{"poster":"DeeDab","date":"2015-11-23T10:41:40.346+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"tbh i agree with all cept 4.\nsave urself some time, dont go for the 50 min game when you can end it at 25 bc you want to test their team's patience.","replies":[{"poster":"CatchTheseHands","date":"2015-11-23T12:56:22.054+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"thanks for the feed back i appreciate it. Is it really better to save yourself some time though? If we go by the law that every game can be thrown or lost at any point in time (be it a sudden and unexpected disconnect on enemy team, 2 enemies get caught at 45 min, with a high respawn timer making the game 5v3 for that period of time, or some internal flaming that is going on that causes someone to afk) then every second the game goes on you have a chance of winning, surrendering eliminates any such chance completely and hands the other team the victory.","replies":[]}]}]}
