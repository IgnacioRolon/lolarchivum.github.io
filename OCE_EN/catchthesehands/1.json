I am always the last to lay blame on my own team. but after i dropped back down to silver 1 after working so hard to get to gold I was looking through my history to see what areas i need to work on I noticed a pretty common trend. 80% of my losses were games lost because of my team feeding their lanes to the point where they have snowballed to oblivion or had connection issues or afk'ing after feeding.\n\nMy rant is not to excuse the loss by blaming my team, but to expose the poor quality of player in the silver 3 to gold 5 ELO. We as a community need to take a good hard look at ourselves, Is our standard of attitude acceptable? What can we do to reduce the toxcitiy in OCE. Over the weekend I was concerned with the number of disconnects also, 1 in every 5 games someone either started late or disconnected during the game, RIOT are you aware of any serious connection issues in our region?\n\nHere is a recount of my match history from top (most recent) to bottom with evidence in the link above.\n\nGame 1 (Defeat)\nAn example of the worst kind of Toxicity (Ransom AFKer&#039;s)\n\nDarius gave away first blood to Riven and was asked by lee to play safe, also advised by myself to try and build as tanky as possible since he is now behind. As soon as he got back to lane he died again, she had not returned to base from first blood. Once again lee asked him to wait for a gank and play safe, by this time Darius was tilted and threatened to afk if anyone said anything further ( i believe this is the worst type of toxicity, holding games ransom with threats of afk unless the team appeases them). By the next time riven got another kill lee lost his cool, I try to calm the situation, Darius goes AFK as promised. Riven runs rampant on all lanes despite our best effort to try and fight back, and we lose the game. Darius is reported for AFK and Toxicity.\n\nGame 2 (Victory)\nAn Example of Champ Select Toxicity\n\nDuring the champ select the last pick called mid, naturally being higher in the pick order and having a desire to play mid I asked if it would be all possible for me to play mid. the last pick player did not respond despite me asking several times, other players picked roles and when it came to my turn I locked in zed mid. At the time of the last pick&#039;s turn he starts raging at the rest of us in capitals WTF I CALLED MID U NOOBS! and proceeded to lock in Annie. getting into the game with no adc I decided to compromise and went botlane with leona, annie continued to flame throughout the game, in the end we did manage to win, but endured a ton of abuse in the proccess. Annie was eventually muted and reported.\n\nGame 3 (Defeat)\nAn Example of Arrogance\n\nMr Brand and Ms Vayne are the culprits in question this match. Brand going a stellar 2/11 contributing to over 50% of our total team deaths. He gave away first blood to the enemy adc. From that point on vayne had connection issues and would drop in and out, despite being asked by myself to play safe until vayne returned brand continued to 1v2 the enemy bot lane assuring us that he can handle it but always coming out 2nd best. by the time we got to transition, vayne was 4 levels behind and Kalista was 6 kills up. Vayne continued to have connection issues and the other 3 on my team opted to surrender at 20. Brand was not reported but vayne was for AFK, though looking back may have been harsh it did seem like genuine connectivity issues.\n\nGame 4 (Defeat)\nAn Example of Intentional Feeding\n\nSona Sona Sona. Where do I begin, her summoner name says it all. First blood given away at 2:15. proceeded to just walk into lane and die after every death. no explanation, no response to us asking why he is doing this. just pure intentional feeding. Sona was reported for intentional feed.\n\nGame 5 (Defeat)\nAn Example of me being beat hard in lane\n\nThis game was one lost because of me, I fed the darius he just simply out played me in lane and I made stupid decisions, however after apologizing to my team for my poor performance I was met with constant flaming and abuse, which I can handle just fine, but others not as resilient as myself may not. I cannot remember who I reported for this one but i think it was the entire team for verbal abuse.\n\nAfter observing my last 5 games and my performance I have come to the conclusion that 4/5 games I experienced Heavy Toxicity, 4/5 games I performed reasonably well, 2/5 games there was an afk or disconnect, 1/5 games an intentional feeder, and 1/5 games I came away with a victory.\n\nThese stats are by my standard pretty horrific.\n\nSo OCE/Riot, what are we going to do about this.","replies":[{"poster":"McRuthless","date":"2015-12-16T05:24:46.895+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I really dont think you did as well as you think is those 5 games. Sometimes people are so blinded by seemingly obvious flaws of others that they fail to notice their own, which are often just as obvious to an unbiased outside observer.\n\nI'll add my 2 cents for a couple of your games.\n\nGame 3: You pick zed jungle despite already having an AD mid laner AND top laner, neither of which have any decent cc. At this point your team comp sucks no matter what the support picks. Even if your team goes even or a bit ahead, volibear will become nearly impossible to kill, and you have no reliable cc which is crucial for locking down yasuo and kalista. Your team also has terrible waveclear so you cannot stall 4v4 while nasus splitpushes unless you already have a lead. Your pick in this game probably drops your chances to 30-40% before the game has even started, and basically every lane needs to win for you to win the game, which is tough since zed sucks at ganking early so you're rolling the dice on whether your teammates win by themselves or not.\n\nGame 1: Similar to game 3, you picked an AD mid when you already had an AD top and jungle and no cc, and the have a riven and kat, who absolutely need to be hard ccd later in the game. Even if the support picks a heavy cc champ you have to rely on that one guy being competent enough to save his cc for priority targets or you will lose every teamfight, and since your in silver there is a high chance he will want to 'carry' and lock in some high damage-lowcc champ anyway in which case you're even more disadvantaged.\n\nGame 2: Zed was a bad pick here too. already AD heavy with trynd, and picking zed when you already have 2 other split pushing champs on your team means you're never going to be able to split and you'll likely have to hang around mid trying to waveclear most of the game. Sure the annie might've been toxic and troll but the fact that he locked in annie instead of playing ADC was probably a blessing in disguise and actually saved your teamcomp from sucking. The fact that this was the only game you won despite the fact the guy was toxic all game should be further proof of what im trying to say about your picks.\n\nGames 4 and 5 are the same. In EVERY SINGLE ONE of your previous 5 games, you've been 3rd/4th pick and locked in an AD champ with no cc, despite the rest of top/mid/jungle having already chosen AD champs with no cc. You're shooting yourself in the foot so hard with your picks. To win games with team comps like in these games your team basically has to win every lane and close out the game in 30 mins or so. This is why you lose every time one guy does badly. The one or two guys on your team that do well cannot make up for them because your teamcomps are so bad when you are even or behind. You either need to learn some extra champs or be able to stomp your lane so hard with zed every game (not getting one or 2 kills, or outfarming the opponent by a bit, and even if you are getting camped) that your team doesn't matter, and judging by the fact that you didn't get particularly fed in any of those 5 games I don't think thats too likely.\n\nIf you want to main only one champ, and especially in mid, I'd strongly suggest switching to an AP one (preferably one with decent cc) since top and jungle are AD based most of the time. This alone can make a lot of those games where one enemy gets fed and makes the game seemingly unwinnable, or ones where you seem to be doing alright then suddenly start losing every teamfight, turn into victories for your team.\n\nP.s. Just noticed your annie winrate is almost 70%, significantly higher than most of the other stuff you play. Perfect example of what I just said, she is AP, and has AOE cc. Go back to her, if you can play her about as well as zed, you will win a lot more games.","replies":[{"poster":"CatchTheseHands","date":"2015-12-17T22:18:34.908+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Appreciaie the feed back, the games in question probably a bad example of champ choice I usually do pick viable meta picks in correlation to team comp, I merely played Zed because I felt comfortable playing him, and was able to dominate lane easily. Annie is the champ I usually main, I have a better win rate with garen but prefer to play champs that can easily influence/gank other lanes such as Zed, I find annies gank potential very dependent on her flash/ult (No gap closer).\n\nFurther more, my win rates with my top 7 most played champs are always considerably higher than people i get queued with, I check every game, and maybe 1 out of 5 games i will have a team mate on par with my win rates/kda. I think the algorithm is not accurate, and whilst it could be argued that I should be expected to carry soloQ carrying is very hard when the team is in a civil war. the figures speak for them self, just looking around other players stats in silver 3 to g5 my winrate and kda is definitely at the top end of the scale.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"ViolinMaker53","date":"2015-12-17T10:01:35.178+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"***","replies":[{"poster":"CatchTheseHands","date":"2015-12-17T22:19:52.543+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Very mature mate, well done.
