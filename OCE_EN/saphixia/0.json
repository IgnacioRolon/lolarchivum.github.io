The best place for this to happen is in normals, because it's the \"standard\" mode of the game and has no impact on ranked.\n\nLet people try and learn, it's the only way they'll get better, and considering the problem is that people are \"bad\" I'd think you'd want them to get better.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Lord Sesshomaru","date":"2017-01-28T05:44:02.342+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"I think having all champions free is great, not only for people trying out new fun champions, but its fantastic for diversity of champions in game _(something that was very much lacking, and has been for a long time.)_\n\nJungle is not solely Lee Sin for a week. \nAdc has a few champs other than Vayne or...
