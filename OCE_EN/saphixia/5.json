Im usually a very nice person and i only get annoyed when people feed and troll. It just so happened that i got 2 games in a row with trolls.\r\n\r\nFirst game i get a pretty good team, and i got to go rengar jungle. Im trying to learn rengar atm but havent really found how to one shot squishies. But our annie Kept asking for ganks, and i told her to stop pushing as much. She started telling me i was bad because i couldnt gank a karthus (which i could, if he wasnt under turret from annie pushing) naturally i tried to defend my self and got even angrier after annie said she woudld afk if i didnt gank. I ended up having to tower dive with annie and our gangplank support so that she could get a kill. She didnt realise it was a gank though, as she continued to tell me i was bad and shouldnt ever play jungle again. I got reported by annie after that game for &quot;being bad and being rude in chat&quot; Kind of hypocritical.\r\n\r\nSecond game we are in champ select and i join late (i have some awful lag at the moment and have stopped playing because of it) i call top, but its already taken. mid is obviously taken, so i call adc and click on draven. Just before i lock him in, i see we have a duo support botlane. Kinda troll (as it wasnt a Thresh Blitz) but ok. So i type oh ok i guess im jungle then, and click rengar (like i said im trying to learn how to play him). i start talking to our morde, who i was going to pick toplane. i then see our support saying &quot;SAPH PICK AN ADC&quot;. There are 3 more seconds left to choose and dont get a pick in time. Turns out a support decided to be a jungle Xin Zhao instead. So what i get once im in game is a barrage of &quot;stupid troll adc report him&quot; as i was trying to defend my self again (I knew i wasnt in the wrong as our morde had proof that he hadnt called but instead trolled) I died first blood, to which our xin zhao flames me even more for. This was also when i found out that yasuo (midlaner) and xinzhao are a duo, and they flame me together (as duos do)I muted them both apart from a small break where i accidently unmuted yasuo, where when i said &quot;huh funny, im not that good at rengar adc&quot; as a joke, he replied with &quot;*league of legends&quot; &quot;man you are bad at spelling&quot; this is a 3/8 adc rengar talking to a 1/11 yasuo, who along with xinzhao decided to start feeding. End of game i got double reported (as duos do) and now im here.\r\n\r\nThere are two reasons im angry with this. Although i was toxic, two games shouldnt be enough to tip the scales (fire emblem intensifies) This is the first time i have ever gotten a chat restriction like i have previously mentioned. But that is the part im annoyed about. The fact that i got sent nothing about how my reports on annie, xin zhao and yasuo had went, but they probably did. Knowing taht i cant get Hextech boxes anymore because i got angry at trolls? While they walk around free, being able to troll whenever and whereever? Its quite sad really, and i find it unfair.\r\n\r\nI checked the match history of everyone after the game and found that yasuo had done the exact same thing the game before in ranked as annie. Xin Zhao seems to be an ARAM-only account. having lost 3 games that he has played not in aram. I have looked at annie and it seems as though it might have been a one off, but its hard to tell as you cant see much of a persons personality through there games.\r\n\r\nI was wondering if a rioter could tell me if they got banned, and if not what i can do about it in the future.\r\n\r\nAlso, how long will it be until i can get hextech chests again, i love the concept of not getting them when you are banned but i dont want to never be able to get them again.\r\n\r\nSincerely, Saphixia","replies":[{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2016-04-02T09:23:49.545+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Ok this is a lot to get through so I'm gonna start at the end of your post. I'm sure that makes a whole lotta sense (not) but I just wanna address it first since it seems to be your biggest issue here.\n\n> I was wondering if a rioter could tell me if they got banned, and if not what i can do about it in the future.\n\nUnfortunately Riot can't tell you anything about the punishments of other players, it's a privacy thing among other reasons.\n\nThat said, if they consistently behave in such a manner as you described, they will be punished. Hopefully that can give you some peace.\n___\nOk so now let's back up a bit.\n\nLet me give you a bit of general context on the punishment first. So far as Riot and the system are concerned, retaliation is not an appropriate response. Defending yourself will never be punished, but responding with negative behaviour in kind will be.\n\nFrom that perspective, to answer your question about fairness, yes it would be, at least from the information you've given. If you want a more accurate assessment on that one feel free to post your chat logs so we can take a look. If there was anything you were unsure about or wanted some perspective on regarding those I'm also happy to help you out there.\n\nFirst game sounds pretty standard from what you've said. Bad enough to be flagged by the system but not bad/consistent enough to be used on it's own (only in rare cases will players receive a first punishment for only one game). Hypocrisy on the Annie's party is pretty shitty but from what you say the report was not undeserved, regardless of where it came from. We also don't know if it was the Annie's report that counted here, just something to remember.\n\nAs for the second game it seems it was a bit more serious. Sounds like the champ select was a real train wreck, but from what you've said, no real fault on your part here. Thresh Blitz is a lane that happens so you weren't doing anything bad by assuming it was a legit lane. Seems however that maybe they had a miscommunication about who was support rather than an intention to play that lane. Honest mistake there and doesn't excuse their behaviour, or unfortunately yours.\n\nNow I can try and give you a bit of perspective here. First of all, muting was a really good idea. Personally I have a tough time muting because I'm too damn curious, but it's still your best bet. \n\nSecond of all you seemed like at a few points you were at least trying to make some fun out of it: \"huh funny, im not that good at rengar adc\" Unfortunately they sound like the kind of trolls that will throw that kind of thing back in your face. It's good to do that, but bringing it up in chat while they aren't muted (I know it was an accident, just offering perspective) just gives them fuel for the fire.\n\nSame deal with defending yourself. Let's be honest, they aren't going to change their minds about you, they don't want to. They've decided to do what they can to make you mad. Defending yourself, in fact responding to them all, just tells them that they are affecting you, and will prompt them to continue. It's a twisted and cruel logic but at least it's predictable. \n\nThe very best thing you can do with players like this is ignore them completely, whether you choose to mute them or not. Then report at the end of the game.\n\nLast thing, can you do anything more? Well if you have screenshots or other evidence of them messing with you, you can submit it to support and they'll take a look, but lacking anything like that, you've already done all you need to. Reporting at the end of games is the most effective way to get people seen.\n\n___\n\nNow the good news, you mention specifically that this is a rare occurrence, and that you were just unlucky to get a few games in a row on a bad day. (You understand I have to maintain a little healthy scepticism, we can never really know the whole story here ;P) Assuming you don't continue the behaviour you will face no further punishments. \n\nAfter three months your punishment tier will drop back to 0 (meaning your next punishment would be the 10 game chat restriction again) and eventually you will also get hextech crafting back (I'm not sure exactly how long this is, only \"months\" I'm not aware of anywhere they've officially said how long it is after dropping your punishment tier back to 0).\n\n___\nSincerely hope I helped here :) Let me know if you have any questions/concerns etc.","replies":[{"poster":"DragonOfTheVoid","date":"2016-04-02T10:41:19.146+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"Unfortunately Riot can't tell you anything about the punishments of other players, it's a privacy thing among other reasons.\n\nSo let me get this correct if I player sed I'm gona f*cking kill you ect ect.

It has nothing to do with privacy its the fact that if you do tell us and someone like that dose not get a ban we can cause a lot of sh*t for you.","replies":[{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2016-04-02T11:12:03.333+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"If you had been banned/restricted would you want it aired for all to see? So people would judge you based on your punishment alone? It's to prevent witch hunting, and to prevent exacerbating the issue.\n\nIn this particular case you have a negative player's report leading to a punishment. Valid or not, what exactly do you think that player would do with that information? Nothing positive I can tell you that much.\n\nYes there are arguments for better transparency, it's why the \"a player has been punished\" notifications exist in the first place, but it's something you have to be very careful about. Partial information can be a very dangerous thing.\n\nIn most cases they can't give the FULL story (privacy laws). And even if they could there are very few people who would take the time to consider the full story before making a judgement of a stranger on the internet.\n\nRiot does not punish without a REASON. Just as they do not fail to punish someone without a reason. Do you, as the frustrated player on the other side of the screen really care if it's a good reason or not? Then what good could possibly come of knowing if someone has been punished? It only discourages reform.\n\nWe need more positive reinforcement, not more negative. The punishment system as it exists is plenty for that.","replies":[{"poster":"DragonOfTheVoid","date":"2016-04-02T11:38:55.750+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"I'm not saying give it to the world give it the the player that was harassed ect ect and say make it clear with the note saying the player such and such has been banned and then go onto say if any of this info is shared then you will get the same punishment.\n\nSeem fair ?","replies":[{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2016-04-02T12:16:26.577+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Not really. Take this case. If that Annie or that Yas got a notification like that, don't you think they'd feel justified in THEIR behaviour? \n\nSo what, only give that information to players who have never been flagged by the system? Everyone's had that one game, we don't know if those flags ever time out. Only new players and the rarest of the rare positive players would ever see them, so then what's the point? That's not a solution. Releasing that information in any scenario has a greater risk of doing harm than it does good.\n\nDo I think there should be more information? Certainly. Why not something like some indication of your report accuracy? It tells you nothing about players but tells you you are reporting the right behaviour.\n\nWe don't know what's in store with the new tribunal, but given the time they've taken, I'd say it's pretty safe to say it's big. Riot have said time and time again they want more ways to reward positive players, and to encourage reform in negative players. Naming and Shaming, to one person or to anyone that person chooses to share it with (like say the boards or other communities) is not the way.\n\nPerhaps we will have to agree to disagree here. I don't think you're wrong on the transparency point, I just think there are much better ways to do it, that don't drag summoners through the mud, whether they deserve it or not. That doesn't make people better, it makes them worse.","replies":[{"poster":"DragonOfTheVoid","date":"2016-04-02T12:26:39.692+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I hope riot dose not fock up with the new system it took them what 4 years if they do they will never live it down like the rework for {{champion:83}}","replies":[{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2016-04-02T12:30:14.059+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Well, everything takes time to get used to.

Try to see the change from Riot's perspective as well if you can, cause more often then not that little bit of insight means things make a whole lot more sense.\n\nIn fact I'd say that's where most of this negative behaviour comes from is the first place. A lack of understanding of the perspective of others.
