My main point is that i live in Perth and get anywhere between 60ms-130ms in a game, but can lag alot sometimes. Compare this to Sydney where most people get around 10-30ms, its a clear advantage. Also, are you ever going to move your servers to Melbourne or Adelaide? They are more in the middle. \r\nhttps://www.google.com.au/url?sa=i&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=images&amp;cd=&amp;cad=rja&amp;uact=8&amp;ved=0ahUKEwie2P3in97MAhUEHaYKHdi4B-IQjRwIBw&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.goingrank.com.au%2Fgeography.html&amp;bvm=bv.122129774,d.dGY&amp;psig=AFQjCNGMyc84jjyBOmuhkgEiWqwD9SHFOg&amp;ust=1463476182393756\r\nas this picture clearly shows, australia alone, let alone the rest of Oceania is big enough to fit majority of europe in. And europe has a EUW and EUNE. you could do this with Ocenia, having a OCEW (Hosted in Adelaide) and an OCENE (hosted in Brisbane or somewhere in New Zealand)","replies":[]}
