Mandarin, Cantonese, Japanese were the most common, with some Korean, German, French, Hindi and even a few people who spoke Arabic.\n\nAnd that was only in Brisbane. OCE is a largely multicultural region. The supported language is English because it’s the majority and they don’t have the resources to support more.\n\nWho are we to deny people speaking their first language in their leisure time. Speaking a second language, even one you are reasonably fluent in is exhausting, I know this first hand. Why should they have to work three times as hard as anyone else just to play a video game? Especially in a scenario like OP shows where clearly others share the language?\n\nYou’re free to report who you wish of course, a false report will only get thrown out and no longer affects report weight, so if you have a vague inkling they might have been toxic you might as well. However to assume negativity isn’t fair to those players if it affects you behaviour/attitude towards them for the duration of the game.","replies":[{"poster":"JasonWazza","date":"2017-10-23T09:35:36.784+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":">if it affects you behaviour/attitude towards them for the duration of the game\n\nWhich it doesn't, but hey lets keep assuming.\n\nI'm already being called racist and shit, not to mention, having racial attacks towards Australians in this topic with no Riot action towards the person doing it.\n\nRacism is apparently ok if it's done to Australians.","replies":[{"poster":"Project Xayah","date":"2017-10-23T10:34:28.611+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"I doubt it was Seras' intention to make an assumption there, and I wouldn't say that *is* an assumption. It's more of a conditional statement. It would be an assumption if you were to replace the \"if\" with \"because\", as that excludes any other possibility.\n\nI doubt any of the Rioters and/or volunteers want you (or anyone else) to think that racism is ok, because it's not. I can certainly understand that you'd likely be feeling insulted and perhaps \"overlooked\" by Riot. If you haven't already, you should use the report feature to report the racist comment you're referring to (I'll admit, I did this the moment I saw it, and I'm hoping you did too).\n\nIt *should* be dealt with appropriately, so long as it's being reported, though from what I understand, certain behaviours are taken with a bit more lenience on the boards than in-game, because of the community that exists here. Hopefully it will be dealt with soon enough.\n\nI'd like to recommend that you take some time to calm down and reflect on how you feel and are behaving at the moment. You seem riled up, which could (perhaps already has) cause you to act in an inappropriate manner, putting you're boards access at risk, and creating unnecessary toxicity with other users. Allow yourself to come back to the discussion with a clear head, then you'll be able to debate your point without needlessly resorting to toxic behaviours.","replies":[{"poster":"JasonWazza","date":"2017-10-24T01:46:31.794+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"BTW that post still isn't removed, racism is ok if it's at Australians.\n\nAnd it's also being actively upvoted.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Outis","date":"2017-10-23T20:11:41.071+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"\"don’t have the resources to support more\"\n\nbillion dollar company doesnt have the resources? please.","replies":[{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2017-10-24T02:26:01.524+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"Riot is a billion dollar company.

It could be friendly banter. \n\nI understand what your saying about riot bring able to filter out the reports but there still gonna get reports. Which could count agaisnt if they do have a bad day and flame someone. Plus the automated system takes into account what people report. So if people are reported enough times for using certain phrases in another language they'll grt punished for it. Even when the same phrase in English would have been fine.
