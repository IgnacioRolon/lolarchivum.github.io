The only reason i&#039;m considering Malzahar is because he&#039;s apparently overpowered even though my friends say he&#039;s boring. I think I would prefer Riven but i&#039;m kind of worried about the skill cap.","replies":[{"poster":"Prince Smashy","date":"2016-08-22T04:24:59.754+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"How do you do soo much damage on riven? \nLike i seen some people destroy the enemy team instantly, yet i do 0 damage to the enemy team.\nI try to Q AA Q AA Q AA to maximise my damage output, but it doesn't feel like my damage is there.\nAny tips on how to maximise the damage output on riven?","replies":[{"poster":"Xuízunä","date":"2016-08-22T08:14:17.822+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Sure! I suggest you grab the right runes and masteries on Riven first! Have a look at my first rune page and my Riven masteries :) Your combo is correct, just make sure you use your W in either ur first Q or second Q and do the animation cancel from start to finish. So check your runes and masteries and if you want to try mine out you can! Build bc, hydra and yommus or you can try lord dominics or grevious if they have healing. Always animation cancel and use ur basic attacks to maximise rivens damage. Running fevor is the way for me because you do so much damage overtime. If you still need help please reply to me :)","replies":[{"poster":"Prince Smashy","date":"2016-08-22T23:49:22.214+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I got the right runes for Riven, do you think it's because the tank meta is too strong for Riven?","replies":[{"poster":"Xuízunä","date":"2016-08-23T11:05:03.395+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It depends because Riven's weakness is alot of armor anyway however, you can beat tanks early game, just get loads of armor pen as I suggested to you before :) Riven sits at a good win rate and is \"balanced\" however we are getting Riven buffs soon! So I am sure we won't have a problem with tanks :) just play right and build right to shred everyone, especially the tank. Hope this helps!

Riven main here that would like to help you out!\nIt is essential you know how to animation cancel with her as she is a high mechanical champ and has a ton of combos! I suggest watching some clips on Youtube on how to do that and also watch BoxBox. He is a streamer that only plays Riven and in every match he explains what he does when he vses other champs. Just make sure to practice and don't give up as she takes skill. If you need a hand on anything else please ask me and I will help as best as I can! :)","replies":[{"poster":"Horizonn","date":"2016-08-21T04:48:53.785+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Holy damn! can you help me too?!","replies":[{"poster":"Xuízunä","date":"2016-08-21T08:57:47.953+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Sure what would you like help with? :)","replies":[{"poster":"Horizonn","date":"2016-08-21T12:31:11.905+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I play alot of riven so i have 100K mastery points but i always lost the Gnar matchup even tho its slighty favored for riven\nany tips?","replies":[{"poster":"Xuízunä","date":"2016-08-21T14:14:02.339+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Sure! Like with any ranged you must play safe. I don't personally like maxing E because it sacrifices alot of Rivens damage. Capitalize on the gnar cooldowns so you can trade well. Wait out the big Gnar so that you can all in ult and he won't have ult. Study his early game. If he plays really agressive against you. Play safe and bring the minions to your tower and call for a gank. If his not abusing his range then you can trade as he is most likely scared of you. Always rush black cleaver first as he will be tanky. When I usually trade initiate with E so you absorb his damage. Study his moves and capitalise on his cooldowns. And don't be afraid if he is bad! You are made to be a duelist! :) Hope this helps!","replies":[{"poster":"Horizonn","date":"2016-08-22T02:36:25.616+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"OMG thank you so much may i add you <3\n{{sticker:slayer-jinx-catface}}","replies":[{"poster":"Xuízunä","date":"2016-08-22T08:14:48.337+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Sure! :)","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Krimzonn","date":"2016-08-21T06:54:27.095+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thank you Xenomazul!
