Shes super fun and actually quite strong at the moment because she just recently got buffed.\n\nAnd if you enjoy play Illaoi, definitely try out Kled when he's on the free week in a couple of weeks. I just got him yesterday, and he is super fun as well, and actually has a surprisingly similar play style to Illaoi.\n\nYour champion pool is very similar to mine, and I absolutely love riven. Definitely try her out, she is just such a fun champion, even if people consider her 'OP'. She's one of those champions you can just never stop getting better at.\n\nAnyway, good luck with finding a new champion bro :)","replies":[]},{"poster":"TheOneUser","date":"2016-08-17T10:29:10.875+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Depends on how you see fun\nIf fun is winning, easier champs like amumu would be good\nmechanics - azir, riven etc\ntrolling - any champ bard's passive is pretty fun\nand other stuff, so it really depends on your playstyle","replies":[{"poster":"Krimzonn","date":"2016-08-17T19:55:03.318+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I like winning games, however I don't like REALLY easy champions, that's why my friends were telling me to get riven because apparently she's really good however she isn't easy.

Fighting as her can be interesting due to the shield and wall mechanics inlane. Low cooldown Q is fun as well. She's cheap too and fits into teams nicely as a tank who can deal a fair amount of damage. If you're looking into someone a bit more expensive, Illaoi is a pretty interesting champion as well. If you want to try ADC, I'd recommend Miss Fortune (Mainly cos she's the only one I play). She does alot of damage, and her in lane Q poke can seem pretty insane at times.

Your descriptions seem really elaborate, so im wondering if you have any more suggestions under what I like to play. More Bursty, annoying to deal with champs like zed or fiora. Would really appreciate it! :)","replies":[{"poster":"LUPIN lll","date":"2016-08-17T09:01:30.610+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Pantheon then. Takes a bit for him to get fed and he falls off lategame, but if you can get fed super early he's a pain. Top lane he has the obnoxious Q poke, Jungle he has the point and click stun. Either way, you can get fed in both and it's fun while it lasts.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"CHEESYLEEKS","date":"2016-08-17T08:44:13.323+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Urgot top/mid.\n\nBully people people out of lane , then destroy them 1v1 once you get your ult.","replies":[]}]}
