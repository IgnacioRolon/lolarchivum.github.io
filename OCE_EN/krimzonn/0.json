Please take the time to vote on my poll to help me out, really appreciate it. If you have any other champions that arent in the poll then feel free to comment their names in the comment section.

However for the rest.\n\nMust Buys: Braum, Viktor, Graves, Leona, Rumble, Maokai, Trundle, Irelia, Jarvan\n\nShould look at buying: Rakan, Camille, Ivern, Kled, Bard, Zyra, Varus, Sejuani, Shyvana, Karma, Olaf, Rammus, Shen\n\nBuy them if you like them: Aurelion Sol, Diana, Volibear, Swain, Malzahar, Kog'maw, Zilean\n\nDon't really need: Yorick, Mordekaiser, Taric\n\nThat being said, its good to own all the champions so you can trade people in ranked. I'd say buy Jarvan or Rumble, since they can both play Top and JG comfortably and if you want to experiment, they can also be ok midlaners.\nMaokai can also be played Top/JG comfortably and can also be played Support or Mid if you really wanted to.\n\nAlso a sneaky tip is, buy all the cheaper champs, and when you only have 6300 IP champs left, just buy 3 champion shards and reroll them. It only costs 5100 IP for 3 shards that guarantee you a champion you dont own upon rerolling. Saves you 1200 IP per champ which is nice.","replies":[{"poster":"Krimzonn","date":"2017-07-14T06:02:26.267+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thanks for the reply. Im really liking the idea as bard as he seems like a champion that could be really fun. In your opinion what other champions out of the list would you say are really fun to play. Im really stuck but ive definetly came up with a short list of Braum, Leona, Bard and Rakan.

Trundle and Camille are also good picks. Kled is a funny champion, though. Nocturne is also a good champion, consider buying him if you don't own him.\nWhen you used one champion for too long, you will somehow get bored by him/her, so consider switching champions once a while would be good. Overall, not a single champion is totally unbeatable in a 1v1 fight, all champions have their weaknesses and strength.","replies":[{"poster":"Krimzonn","date":"2017-07-22T03:13:45.101+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I own Zed and Nocturne, I may consider Kled, I recently bought Rakan and Bard so I dont really have any other champs im interested in, may look at kled at a later date","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Psylock1234","date":"2017-07-16T11:53:15.038+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"non of them get twitch his ullt melts i team fights and gives him good distance","replies":[{"poster":"Krimzonn","date":"2017-07-22T03:13:06.417+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Everyone on the list are champions I DONT own, Twitch is a champion i already own, hense why hes not on this list.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Nightjar","date":"2017-07-14T10:46:04.412+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"the correct answer is to purchase champion shards.
