I can understand Normals but URF/Gamemodes? common it&#039;s not fun to play with people like this, for example i picked Nunu for a game and my pick won sadly we were matched against J4&#039;s and we lost the match, during the whole time my team was raging at me saying &quot;Why did you pick nunu you f**kin noob&quot; &quot;OMG you are stupid&quot; I even had one person say &quot;Nunu is hard&quot; I don&#039;t get on how people can still be Toxic in a bloody gamemode its meant for fun and relax from the stress of ranked or a bad day we should be happy Riot does these things for us, When they can just not do anything at all. \r\n\r\nIn particular the toxicity in URF was absolutely horrible I want to play Urgot in URF then let me play it but no &quot;GG report Urgot for feeding&quot; \r\n\r\nTL:DR: People still managing to be d***s in relaxing fun gamemodes \r\nIs there such thing as &quot;Fun&quot; in League of Legends? sorry for the rant just wanted to express my thoughts","replies":[{"poster":"GigaPube","date":"2015-10-18T12:19:11.973+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"the thing is, in one for all, when people want to play a champ/s they would either accept that, or fail to realise that, their entire team has to play the exact same champ. since everybody wants to play different champs there can only be one thing that unites their different opinions. strong champs. nunu is not a strong champ especially in one for all. for some reason you not only want to play nunu but you want your whole team to be nunu's against whoever you're versing? either way you find that fun for some reason. the reason people get mad at you is because you have a unique sexual pleasure in wanting a team of nunus running around feeding at some or most points, and so that is classified as trolling and is frowned upon. id continue whatever i was saying but i have no idea where im going. but id hate to play fucking nunu in that mode.....there is absolutely no chance of winning against a team who would play to a strongest-possible-pick meta of this mode","replies":[{"poster":"The Worst Baker","date":"2015-10-18T18:54:25.449+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I used the Nunu match as a example, and i stated above that URF was the worst culprit of toxicity in gamemodes","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"SammyTheDeadRat","date":"2015-10-18T12:04:50.799+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"{{champion:17}}  Can solve your problems","replies":[]}]}
