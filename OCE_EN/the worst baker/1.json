Im not a good player i make mistakes and i admit to them but when i get a Tristana that builds shiv first and has 34 cs at 20 minutes and blames team for her loss, who also plays ranked with 90 normal wins. It&#039;s unfair getting people like this ESP in Promos/0lp range \r\n\r\nIm asking for help i want Gold by end of season or at least something better than Silver III how do i deal with these types of players \r\nmy main champions are\r\n\r\nTop: {{champion:57}} {{champion:114}} {{champion:157}} \r\nMid: {{champion:112}} {{champion:4}} {{champion:7}} \r\nJungle: {{champion:64}} {{champion:421}} {{champion:57}} \r\nADC:{{champion:119}} {{champion:51}} {{champion:236}} \r\nSupport:{{champion:412}} {{champion:111}} {{champion:89}} \r\n\r\nPlease leave suggestions on what i can do to improve my play","replies":[{"poster":"Iam Desk","date":"2015-10-05T02:48:22.539+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"In my humble opinion, as with anything in life, best to not dwell on what others are doing and concentrate on what you're all about.\n\nWhen people are trolling, or not building in a fashion suitable to them or their team, or raging at everyone, I just ignore them (or mute them) and get on with what I need to do. Even in games that I lose badly, I'll sit back after the match and think about what I could have done better. You'd be surprised at how not blaming anyone else, and cultivating a positive/introspective attitude, can change your game play ten fold.\n\nAlso, spam/main one lane, and a few champions. When you're climbing any ladder from low rankings, this is the way to go. Trying to rank up by maining heaps of champs, only limits the speed and proficiency. I had a similar problem when I pvp'd in World of Warcraft. I played one character max level in Arena matches, but outside of that, I just spammed Battlegrounds with a tonne of other characters at various levels. Once my team mates (who were real life friends) started to move beyond my skill level and started finding better partners, I quit playing random characters and f**king around in game, and played nothing but my Shaman. As soon as I concentrated solely on playing one toon the whole time, my game play increased dramatically, and we finally broke the 2.2k rating (which was huge back then, especially for us)\n\nAnyways, what works for one, may not for another. Best of luck\n\nPeace","replies":[]},{"poster":"Caffeinated","date":"2015-10-03T06:29:01.651+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You should check out summoner school on reddit, there's a lot of good advice there :) The big one you're probably going to get honestly is to just spam Yas/Maoki and learn to queue dodge when you don't get a role with a win rate around 60%+ - you'll slowly climb based on your op.gg if you're consistent. KDA is good, kill part is good, it's probably just a case of stop playing games where you know in advance that you're going to lose or break even based on your past gameplay. \n\nYou're always going to have these kind of players, so best to work on yourself and what you can do better :) If I was forced to adc in a match and didn't sensibly queue dodge, I'd very much be one of the players dragging your climb down. Put me in supp? That's where I'm able to hold my own.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Adam btw","date":"2015-10-03T03:39:20.316+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"{{champion:57}} is good but that ultimate cooldown nerf has affected him heavily imo.  \nI had him mastery 5 before the nerf but I never play him anymore.\nHoneslty just play Darius top","replies":[]}]}
