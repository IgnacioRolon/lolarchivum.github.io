Otherwise all those Twitch streamers and professionals would be banned instantly for using them all the time on stream, no? It has been approved by Riot as something that does not give an unfair advantage, as all they do is give knowledge on item builds on strong comps, which someone could just as easily search up on Google, and they perform the same as \"Cheat Sheets\" that are still being released every patch, just they are a program rather than an image.","replies":[{"poster":"biohrt","date":"2019-10-07T09:34:55.027+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"thank you, also I kinda had a hunch roit knew about it.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"bgentle2myashe","date":"2019-10-07T00:59:27.396+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"Well anything that could potentially give you an advantage is deemed as cheating. \nHow-ever, Knowledge based software should be ok but the software owner has to make the effort to get it approved and then can it be marketed as such and used.\nI don't know much about Riot's policies for non approved software but the general census is pretty clear that any software whilst in game is not acceptable. As for before matches, minimally it is still a grey area since Riot also has total control over any software that relates to any patented aspect of the game or company. \n","replies":[]}]}
