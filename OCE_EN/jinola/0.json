The costs add up to keep transferring one account, and grinding new levels in each region is tricky as a casual player, especially as I&#039;m not sure whether I&#039;ll return to that region in the foreseeable future or not. I also tried another MOBA game where you&#039;re not tied to a region, but wasn&#039;t into it.\r\n\r\nI messaged support and they confirmed that the cost of switching is quite high to &quot;avoid abuse&quot; of the system, and that nothing exists to get discounted transfers. I&#039;m not sure what part of the system users could abuse with a discounted multiple switch pass, other than gaining region-exclusive discounts.\r\nI would imagine that only people who are in a similar situation as me would fork out 5000+ RP in one go for future transfers, the price might be too high for one trying to abuse the system to reap benefits.\r\n\r\nJust wanted to get other people&#039;s thoughts on the matter as I couldn&#039;t find a similar thread with the keywords I tried.","replies":[{"poster":"Jinola","date":"2018-03-24T10:21:35.627+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The games aren't particularly fun during the levelling up stage so it's not a preference.
