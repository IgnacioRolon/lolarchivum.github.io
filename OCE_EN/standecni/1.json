Placing the gate at max range on top of Shock Blast seems to trigger this. Not too certain if other players have had this before, but I&#039;ve experienced it several times now.","replies":[{"poster":"Standecni","date":"2015-05-16T01:12:02.217+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It's better to use Shock Blast before using Acceleration Gate on most occasions and I've seen a lot of Jayce players do this. It's still a little disappointing to see the trick fail, but like you said, it may just be the way it's made.\n\nThanks, I'll keep that in mind next time. :)","replies":[{"poster":"HORSE OF FORCE","date":"2015-05-16T01:23:31.104+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"For the future, use the \"Reply\" button to reply to someone.
