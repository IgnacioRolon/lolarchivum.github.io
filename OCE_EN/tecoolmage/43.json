For example: Person A has 50 ping, person B has 500 ping. If they both enter a message at the same time it will take 550ms for it to appear completely on person A's computer but 1000ms for it to appear completely on person B's computer. Depending on when each person hits enter and what their ping is, it can make it seem like they each got in first on their end.","replies":[{"poster":"TeCoolMage","date":"2015-06-30T08:00:04.240+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Uh, that's what I mean by inconsistent, it's not the same by all the players.\n\nIt's nice to finally know why, however","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"heartbr0ken","date":"2015-06-29T13:47:16.568+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Don't you mean Team Builder?","replies":[{"poster":"TeCoolMage","date":"2015-06-29T14:11:48.506+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Blind pick summoner's rift.
