Her buff ability even has three shiny orbs which explode in water.\r\nWith Janna, she uses her Q and everyone goes flying, but her W and E are harder to notice.\r\nWith Soraka, you have her Q, which does very little damage compared to everything else, and can make green sparkles cover the ADC\r\n\r\nAll her power is in her W and while Nami and Janna look like they&#039;re working in tandem with their ADCs, Soraka looks like she&#039;s just spamming W and the ADC is doing all the work, when in reality it&#039;s because of her the ADC&#039;s HP bar never moves down.\r\n\r\nI think Soraka is strong but just doesn&#039;t look that way, or feel rewarding.

I don't notice when their health never moves down unless I specifically look for it though, I get lost in the battle and focus on hitting my Qs (which benefit myself more than anyone because of how much it heals and how little it deals), and keeping in range for W.\n\nI think this is what Riot meant when they said healing is unfun. I think they should just give Soraka some independent power (Janna has self peel, Nami has self sustain, Soraka isn't left with much except her Q heals), and push her in the direction of being like Vladimir except less tank -mage and more support-mage.","replies":[]}]}]}
