Why does Riot make half the spells useful and the other half useless?! (Always Heal, Flash, Teleport, Smite and Ignite. Occasionally Barrier, Ghost and Exhaust. Never Clairvoyance and Clarity)?","replies":[{"poster":"kJs","date":"2015-06-13T15:39:13.983+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Note: Riot didn't conceptually create half of the summoner spells to be useless. They simply developed, over time with changes and implements from both the meta (by players) and Riot, and ended up that way. \n\nYou simply have to take {{summoner:4}} on almost every champion set up.\n{{summoner:6}} is useful for {{champion:27}}, {{champion:2}}, {{champion:77}} and every other high movement speed tanks out. \n\nThe main reason {{summoner:12}} is taken is to provide global presence. Typically taken by top laners because they are often the farthest from the fight early to mid. Dragon is often the focus in much of the game. \n\n{{summoner:21}} Used to be used like {{summoner:7}} in previous seasons. Probably the biggest reason that {{summoner:7}} is taken is because of its utility/mobility aspect. The other big reason being that you can heal your support with it as well. You can run away easier, and chase people for that last AA as an ADC. The heal is also permanent, unlike {{summoner:21}}. \nIMO {{summoner:1}} should have the movement speed boost from  {{summoner:7}}.\n\n{{summoner:2}} is useful for long range champions sometimes, but you lose out on kill potential by not taking {{summoner:14}}. It actually covers a significantly larger area than {{item:3363}}. I've only ever seen it on a {{champion:76}} a couple of times and one time on a {{champion:51}}. These were largely before the trinkets though.\n\nEDIT: Barrier Buff Idea - http://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/gameplay-balance/LEkQY2Uv-barrier-buff-idea?show=nested ","replies":[{"poster":"JasonWazza","date":"2015-06-14T08:20:41.425+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":">It actually covers a significantly larger area than {{item:3363}}.\n\nAs in it covers the entire map on a 60 second cooldown.\n\nThe reason the summoners don't get run isn't because they are necessarily bad, but more a lack of summoner spell slots.\n\nWith Flash being nearly mandatory on every champion, you can only have one more summoner, and as much as clairvoyance is a great summoner, the current meta kinda relies on the summoners we take.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Hyde","date":"2015-06-14T23:21:29.158+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I sometimes take {{summoner:13}} on {{champion:3}}  in the mid lane just because being able to spam my q at level 1 can get ridiculous damage onto the lane opponent and allowing you to control the lane right from the start. however It becomes kinda useless later on in the game because I rely on the mana and mana regen from item more and more so, its good for early lane phase but apart from not not as useful as flash and such like :)","replies":[]},{"poster":"Tele","date":"2015-06-13T22:24:38.865+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Clarity will always be trash but since they have heal, they probably need a mana counterpart.
