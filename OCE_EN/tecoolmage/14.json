That's actually a really tough question. But I think the main skill you need to learn as Nami is movement prediction. It can be a really hard high level mechanic if the opponents are good, but it's really the only way you're going to land game changing bubbles. You need to remember that Nami has an almost \"perfect kit\", but this makes her a high skill cap champion. \n\nMovement prediction is way to extensive to cover here, [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0LXgLBxihU) video explains the basics well but there's much more to it.\n\nA good combo that might not be doing is to, slow them first with e then try to q when you're slowed. The movement speed buff from e will help you catch up to them, and the slow can make landing q really easy.\n\nTL;DR\nLearn to predict movement, watch the video I linked.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Plasmarine","date":"2015-09-02T07:21:31.394+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Personally I don't play her in Summoners Rift but I absolutely effing love getting her in ARAM, because it's a lot easier to hit your skill shots with so many enemies, and also a lot of teammates to bounce your heals to enemies.\nPlay a bunch of ARAMs while she's free week and you should get her/be able to trade for her quite a few times. It'll be a lot easier to learn her in that game mode and then you can take what you learn to SR afterwards.\nIn Sr though, start by playing her as support. She's a lot stronger as support cause she can bounce her heal through her adc, also giving them a speed boost. Also you'll have exhaust making it almost impossible for you to miss your snare if you've used it.\nAnother thing to do if you have ult up is ult first, the snare them after cause they'll be knocked up and slowed or w/e that thing does, can't remember. If they're moving around a lot I wouldn't really try snaring, wait until they're moving in for CS and then chuck it at them. I think landing your Q is the hardest part about Nami and one of the most important things to do, so keep practicing that! This can also be why you're having trouble in bots, cause you've got to predict the enemies movement.. And a lot of the time bots just don't move like you think they should lol.\nAlso look up some vids of people playing her, always super helpful\nAnyways good luck :^)","replies":[]},{"poster":"McRuthless","date":"2015-09-01T22:46:42.345+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"She's basically a purely utility champion and requires a lot of decision making on when and where to use her spells to actually be effective. Her main cc (q) is small aoe and has a fairly long cast time so its difficult to hit reliably unless you've already slowed them with e or someone else has cc'd them. W is usually a waste of mana unless you can get it to bounce between several people, and you need to be thinking about who to use w and e on to make the most use out of them. Basically focus on using your spells effectively, if you're just spamming heal on cd and throwing out q's at random you will likely be useless. Her item scaling is also very poor and she benefits alot from having teammates around, wouldn't recommend playing her mid.","replies":[]}]}
