No, using the same champion over and over again is not a form of insanity, otherwise insanity would be more sane than what you're currently doing, I don't win every match and I don't lose every match.\n\nI try out new builds, different roles, and all in all, if someone doesn't like what I do with my champion pool, I'd be glad to hear some arguments but \"stop being a sook\" doesn't count.\n\nEven when I do use the same build, I try out new strategies, meet new personalities and when you come to realize the game is decided by the 9 other people in the match and not you alone, it's important to find fun in ways that aren't just \"Hoard IP, buy champ, test champ, repeat\"","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]}]}
