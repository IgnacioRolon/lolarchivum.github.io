Help.","subforum":"Gameplay & Strategy","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I&#039;ve only played one champ while getting to level 30 that&#039;s melee, in one match, and I failed horribly. It was Maokai... And over several months ago.\r\n\r\nNow, I decided a few moments ago to try Volibear, and fed the bots really hard... Couldn&#039;t even last hit properly.\r\n\r\nCan someone please give me advice, for a Xerath + Soraka player wanting to try out Volibear + Maokai, for the first time ever?","replies":[{"poster":"Strat","date":"2015-08-04T09:52:58.191+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Learn to stutter step - that is, autoattack, send a movement command as soon as it hits (to animation cancel) and AA again. Your AA has a cooldown and if you don't send a move command you're wasting the time between autoattacks (since your champion won't move until the enemy moves out of your autoattack range). This is doubly useful on ranged champions too, since the exact same problem occurs (you won't move between attacks unless the enemy moves out of range).\n\nThe difference between stutter stepping and not stutter stepping can be the difference between 1 AA and 6 AAs. And yes, AAs are important on EVERY champ, even mages and supports. Soraka deals 50 damage per autoattack at level 1. So 2 AAs without stutter stepping is 100 damage, whereas 5 AAs with stutter stepping is 250 damage! That's almost the damage of a rank 5 skill on many champs!\n\nIf possible, save your dashes/movement speed abilities during a gank. As in, walk up behind the enemy, keep following him, and when the ENEMY burns a spell (e.g. flashes or dashes) that's when YOU dash/flash after him.\n\nThere's a lot more than that, but a lot of the other things will come with experience. Watch pro streamers on twitch.tv to see how melee champions should be played in general.","replies":[{"poster":"TeCoolMage","date":"2015-08-05T10:14:26.935+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"thx I never really thought about stutter stepping, and using MS buffs for ganks, but it's hard to use voli's Q for ganking if it throws the enemy behind me (i.e. towards the enemy tower)","replies":[{"poster":"Strat","date":"2015-08-05T10:56:04.608+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"No you missed what I meant. You *don't* use the Q while you're running to him. You flank him, attack him with E and W, and when he flashes (or at least dashes) THEN you Q after him back towards your side.","replies":[]}]}]}]}
