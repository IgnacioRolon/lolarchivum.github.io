You can ward the lonely river brush as well.\n\nBasically this but I'd like to expand on it. \n\nWarding is basically vision where you place vision on where you need it most thus this will depend on the champion compositions and blue/purple side. If they have a early game ganker like Lee Sin you should ward the route they will most likely take as soon as it's 3-4 minutes. That's the time zone they will most likely gank. This is usually Tri + River at bot and top lane; and usually the slopes that lead towards the river (Raptors or Blue Buff). You need to ward further in when they have an Eve for example. Remember to always purchase a pink ward if that's the case and place it behind you. This way a lane gank + flank will be impossible to execute. Just remember the strengths and weaknesses of the jungler and ward accordingly.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"ChuffeR","date":"2015-06-14T03:21:23.536+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"I like to tell support mains that deep wards are really crucial if you want to gain an edge on the game. After your first back you should either have a sightstone or mobility boots. If you have mobility boots you can easily get into their jungle but you will not have many wards to spare. Its always wise to pick up 2 pink wards anytime you can because they provide the best vision (being infinite and detectable). \nI'll post up a picture that details the best spots to ward as blue and purple side supports.\n\nAs you can see, if you ward these spots, not only will you have complete vision of half their jungle which will give you the perfect idea of where the jungler is headed, you will have effectively warded for mid lane and even top lane (If they see the jungler is bottom side, they can't possibly gank top). I included a pink(red) ward to  show you a good spot to ward for pink as its usually not checked. You can change the mid lane side brush on purple with a pink because that is rarely checked!","replies":[{"poster":"Ediwir","date":"2015-06-14T03:46:59.158+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The problem with deep warding is that sometimes it's too risky to get there for most squishy supports.\nIn that situation, a walking nuclear arsenal with a ward in his hand might be a really appreciated help.\nOr you could just be Taric, and walk fabulously trough enemy fire like a gem-covered DiCaprio.\n{{champion:44}} ","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Lauricella3","date":"2015-06-16T06:08:52.913+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"you can pink ward the river on one side and buy a ward for the other, or go for the more risky use trinket on one side and hug that side.

I was thinking a few days ago to start writing something, like a collection of hints and tips, but it just got tooo much.\nAs a mage, a good starting point would be to get the upgraded yellow trinket ({{item:3361}}) and _ask your support_ where he wants more vision.\nReally, if he's worth anything he'll have at least a few spots in mind that he can't reach right then, and he'll hugely appreciate the help.\nMight even move some other guy to place one or two.
