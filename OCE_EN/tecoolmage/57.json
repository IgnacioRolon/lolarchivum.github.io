There were also a bunch of changes made thanks to player feedback\n\n* Teammate ult timers - we’ve added in timers that indicate when your allies can use their ults! Before the update, this was just represented by a binary green light, but you’ll see the ult timers fill up with the update, meaning you can more accurately figure out when it’s time to wombo.\n\n* Teammate summoner spell timers - hit the tab key at any point and you’ll see if your allies can use their spells, and, if not, how long until they can.\n\n* Teammate mana bars have returned - we left out allied mana bars with the update, thinking they weren’t super important. We were wrong, you guys let us know, and they’re back in now.\n\n* Persistence - if you open champion stats or latency display during a game, it’ll persist between matches.\n\n* Level up ceremony - we added a bunch of animations and sounds to make sure you know when you ding.\n\n* Spellbar clarity - made some pretty hefty changes to the shape, color, and animation of cooldown, loss of control and out of mana to improve readability.\n* Minimap changes - game time feels like it belongs near the minimap because timing is usually related to map objectives, but ultimately playtests and feedback have shown it's a more natural fit in the top corner.\n* Visual style - we’re all for minimal, but we may have overshot it. We’ve since tried to squeeze in more magic through texture work and animation.\nAccessibility - added camera lock and options buttons back in.\n\n---\n\n[Late July/Early August](http://oce.leagueoflegends.com/en/news/game-updates/features/hud-update-heads-ranked-515) - HUD goes to ranked 5.15. \nThere were also a bunch of changes made thanks to player feedback\n\n**Readability**\n\n* New font and styling\n* Larger team frames, meters, and ult timers\n* Full square cooldown indicator\n* New colors differentiating “on cooldown” and “out of mana”\n* Larger stat icons and text\n* Larger Ping and FPS displays\n* Scoreboard now has more padding, larger champ portraits, and larger fonts\n* Added drop shadow to chat\n* Brighter XP bar\n* Larger Summoner spell timers on the scoreboard\n* Active ability events have been changed to gold (level up, toggle, just off cd) to differentiate from unavailable (cooldown, OoM)\n\n**Animation and Audio**\n\n* Shortened and pulled back on many animations including “level up”, “just off cooldown”, and toggles\n* Scaled back many audio cues\n\n**Layout**\n\n* CS, KDA, and Team KDA has rejoined game time in the top right\n* Scoreboard improvements including larger and clearer summoner spell and respawn timers\n\n**Misc**\n\n* Added colored bonus stats\n* Added cast bars for all abilities other than instant casts\n* Swapped Crit and Attack Range in player stats\n* Mute buttons on the Scoreboard are now always visible\n* Minimap can now be scaled smaller","replies":[{"poster":"TeCoolMage","date":"2015-09-04T10:08:35.406+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I understand but I feel like going in game immediately was a bit of a scary choice and the before-game client with its lack of offline chatting and slow to update summoner-levels+champ-refunds needed more work and could've extended the feed back process much much longer and in-depth.\n\n\nI actually do like the UI (tbh I prefer it a lot more, good job!), I was just wondering about _why_ the choice was made when haters were expected and the least that can be done is to squeeze the community dry of feedback","replies":[{"poster":"Maraudaur","date":"2015-09-04T10:25:41.613+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'm  not on the team, so I can't say this with 100% certainty. But I believe when a feature is ready we should deliver the feature to players, that's how we will get the best feedback.  \n\nThe reason we don't hold off until ALL feedback is in is because every time we make a change there is new feed back. If we wait for feedback to run dry before we release anything, our players would get new features extremely slowly. I would much prefer us deliver something of value (HUD update) to players then build on it as we receive more feedback from more players.","replies":[]}]}]}]}
