Sometimes I meet a supp or jg who does it. The ADC doesn&#039;t even bother and just holds it in her inventory to look cool.\r\n\r\nI would REALLY recommend you don&#039;t use this trinket AT ALL in ANY GAME because of how stupid the idea behind it is.\r\n\r\nI beg of you Riot, to change the item in a way that asserts it can never replace traditional wards and sightstones while still retaining its purpose.","replies":[{"poster":"Legends man1","date":"2015-07-17T22:06:50.747+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"If you took it away, the players who actually use it now probably wouldn't bother warding at all. Its fine it doesn't hinder anyone's game. If you see someone holding it and not using it, tell them to ward somewhere, and ping where you want warded. Surely if you tell them where to ward they'll do it. Most of the time people dont ward because either they forget or either they don't know a good place to ward and so they hold it thinking they'll ward later when its needed.","replies":[{"poster":"TeCoolMage","date":"2015-07-18T01:18:35.256+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"But it's only a 1 minute ward, and sometimes I'd rather they didn't trinket ward at all so they'd die more often and learn the fact they actually do need to buy actual real wards. \n\nThis actually happens nearly every game:\n\n*triple kill and only bottom lane is left with Supp and ADC because I spam ping danger in the catatonic-farm-trances ADCs face when I see them in my wards.*\nSupp(me): why am I the only one warding?\nMid: I ward A LOT! My trinket just expired, though, so I'm going back to ward that bush again.\nSupp: Maybe that's because they only last one minute, are near useless, and give you a false sense of security when you actually need to ward BOTH SIDES of your lane!\nMid: Hey, at least I use my trinket more than you and top do!\n*Top doesn't even ward at all and my trinket is blue*","replies":[]}]}]}
