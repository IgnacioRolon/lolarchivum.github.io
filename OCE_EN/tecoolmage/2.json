Runes like flat armour/MR/HP will make a HUGE difference in the early game against competent opponents and can be the difference between living and dying or getting zoned off cs. The marginal benifit you get from scaling runes isn't worth it if you're losing gold because you died/missed out on a kill/ had to play safer than you otherwise would have had to.\n\nScaling runes are usually only useful if you wouldn't get much benefit from flats in the early game (e.g scaling AP/MR/CDR blues vs AD lanes or in the jungle)","replies":[{"poster":"TeCoolMage","date":"2015-07-21T06:29:59.670+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"In season 5 you gain better stats in level 6 with scaling runes.

I don't know about when other people play mid, but I get to lvl 6 so early by getting the farm I need instead of wasting time trying to kill with less than four abilities that I'd gladly take scaling runes, and only bother to use flat runes with stats I need right at the start (MR against LeBlanc, Akali or Fizz, who all can get first blood very very easily, but not against poke or harass champions), or if I'm in a duo lane.\n\nIf I was support or ADC I'd definitely take flats, mid and top are definitely better with scaling but top can do with flats if they need it truly, and jungle depends on the type (gank vs control vs farm jungler).","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]}
