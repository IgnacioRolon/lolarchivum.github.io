It can be really hard to ascertain whether enemies will  get away or win a duel. Quite a lot of players will really want to secure that kill for the team even if it means using an ability or even more rarely, an ultimate. \n\nYou should try to view these situations as more of a team-effort rather then an individual getting the kill.","replies":[{"poster":"TeCoolMage","date":"2015-08-28T06:29:15.794+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"That's actually what I do.
