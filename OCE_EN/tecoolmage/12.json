This is because his slow and CC is ridiculous at early levels.\r\n\r\nThe main strategy against Ekko is to deny CS by pushing a lot, but even when I buy as much AP as I can and get AP runes and masteries (I used to buy the most AP in one item at the start of a match) I can&#039;t poke him enough to recall and let me farm, as he easily clears the minion wave at level 3. And this is considering he _doesn&#039;t_ buy a crystalline flask or five health potions. When I **do** get him to low HP, I run out of mana and need to recall too, or AA until I get ganked by the enemy jungle.\r\n\r\nAnd his range, he can dash then combine it with one of his other skills to outrange me while doing more damage. And this is when I play {{champion:101}} and passively farm with Q.","replies":[{"poster":"Lost In Time","date":"2015-06-14T10:04:35.434+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Xerath is a major counter to Ekko\n\nAlong with Azir, Malzahar a level 2 Yasuo.\n\nSkill matchups include Ahri, Akali or Twisted Fate.\n\nYou counter him by not standing in the minion wave - then he has to choose to use his Q to clear waves or harass.

Vlad is a good option for this, as well as Cho'Gath. Teemo, if you play him well, also can counter Ekko because of his blind, and you can bait him into your shrooms. His MS boost can help you live to, but he is squishy enough to get 3-shot by Ekko if he does catch you.\n\nYou have to look at it this way, Ekko will poke you every chance he gets. If he is farming over poking you, while you are poking him, then you are winning. This is why Ekko basically grabs a free kill at lvl2, because he pokes you with Q, then when you get to around half health, he just E's in to pop his passive and if you are still alive, ignites your ass for the kill.\n\nOh, and try to grab Merc Treads if you can put them in your build, since the MR and Tenacity is quite useful against Ekko.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Fndrr22dxd","date":"2015-06-14T08:02:40.441+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"There are few champions that can clear a wave easily at level 3.

(Remember, this is the most optimal situation, chances are, he's gotten boots or simply has a seizure when I raise my arms up.)\n- I run out of mana, and proc passive, either on Ekko himself, or on another minion, it doesn't matter. Even if I do get 1-4 auto attacks on him while I know his abilities are on cooldown, he just retreats earlier to compensate.\n- I Q to get him to critical health\n- Crystalline flask or health potion, and playing passive until he gets to half health. By the time his potions are used up, my passive is finally off cooldown and I can stop auto attacking and poke him again.\n- Recall after running out of potions, but usually I die before this happens, and the jungler is confirmed to approach at this point.\n\nThe process repeats until Ekko begs for the jungler to gank me, while I beg the jungler to gank Ekko. If Ekko gets his jungler out, he wins instantly, if I get my jungler out first, he has a moderate chance of finally dying. Even if I **do** avoid dying for all of the laning phase, if Ekko doesn't die more than once, he ends up snowballing somehow even if I have more CS than he does.\n\nArguably even worse matchup than LeBlanc. When she dodges, it's because she's dashed or teleported. When Ekko dodges, it's because he's gotten two slows on me, or a slow and a stun.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Chicken4dinner","date":"2015-06-14T09:19:52.915+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yasuo is his sempai.\n\nSchool's Ekko any day of the week","replies":[]},{"poster":"DianasGotSwag","date":"2015-06-14T08:04:31.175+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Play Darius","replies":[]}]}
