Like if the team is all AD, why not go Ziggs or Twisted Fate bottom? A ranged AP Carry.\nThe answer I was told, was simply DPS. You don't want all burst damage, you want people who are capable of doing damage \"safely and consistently\". Basically ranged auto attackers.\nSo unless you want to go Attack Speed Ziggs or something, the meta won't be changing anytime soon.\n\nThis is, after 5 years of people playing, the most efficient way to set up a team in terms of gold and damage distribution.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Garens Harem","date":"2015-07-06T13:05:37.298+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"i just fuk the meta and play vlad botlane","replies":[{"poster":"TeCoolMage","date":"2015-07-07T02:05:25.849+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I play a kill lane at bot with a friend, I'm Xerath and she's Syndra.

For bot lane you have the Marksman and the Support, and in the early stages of the game marksman champions are more vulnerable. Essentially, they need to be \"carried\" to get to a point where they are capable of carrying. The difference between bot lane and mid lane champions is that mid lane champions are usually high burst, high damage champions (Mostly Mages and Assassins) and are less reliant on being carried early game, whereas bot lane champions are for more sustained fights where they can get off lots of basic attacks and abilities over a longer period of time.","replies":[]},{"poster":"tSpecR","date":"2015-07-08T00:45:32.804+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I see the occasional AP down bot and the occasional adc in mid, both can work depends on the champ and the counter, main problem I find is mana issues which makes it hard to farm down bot as quick as the enemy adc also hard to farm without pushing the lane.","replies":[{"poster":"TeCoolMage","date":"2015-07-08T12:53:15.157+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=tSpecR,realm=OCE,application-id=FjGAIbRv,discussion-id=moN0Rhbz,comment-id=0008,timestamp=2015-07-08T00:45:32.804+0000)\n>\n> I see the occasional AP down bot and the occasional adc in mid, both can work depends on the champ and the counter, main problem I find is mana issues which makes it hard to farm down bot as quick as the enemy adc also hard to farm without pushing the lane.\n\nPushing is def a huge problem with AP in such a gank-vulnerable lane, but wards will save many lives.

I would personally pick {{champion:42}}  even though he is a mostly AD champ his W builds AP, his Q builds AD n AP and his R builds AD and AP. The reason I say Corki is because in team fights he places a lot of magic da,age down which helps balance the team out. This might sound crazy but this is the method SKT T1 used in the MSI 2015 against TSM. If Faker was going to play Urgot mid lane they had to give Bang (ADC) Corki. But in the end they did a trade and Bang had Urgot and Faker had Cassiopeia. I see it in many Famous teams. They try to balance it out.
