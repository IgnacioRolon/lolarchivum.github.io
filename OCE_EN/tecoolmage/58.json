It won&#039;t be OP as a team with 4 Rylai&#039;s will be late enough game for Anivia to have a ton of mana from tear and/or RoA to keep R on for a long long time, but it helps with support with Ashe lanes in laning phase when AoE abilities push the minion wave and Qs cooldown is longer than E (and usually before lvl 6)\n\nI think it's only fair Cassiopeia + Teemo lanes are really fun, but now that slows don't stack, Ashe and Anivia lanes aren't good at all.","replies":[{"poster":"Garens Harem","date":"2015-09-06T02:49:40.170+0000","up_votes":0,"down_votes":4,"body":"no thanks\n\ni dont want anivia buffs","replies":[{"poster":"TeCoolMage","date":"2015-09-06T03:25:55.473+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"No one even plays Anivia support...\n\nUnless the Jungler is Ashe, it's not much of a buff to normal, solo lane Anivia in general\n\nIn fact, I've never seen another Anivia player before in game...

So in all respects fizz does have a poison. Taking that logic into account, all the aforementioned champion's abilities fit the Requirements to reset Cass's E, but they don't because Cass would have a 100% ban rate if that was the case, so they classify what is a poison and what isn't by name alone, and so if they judge it by name alone, that means that Anivia's 'Chilled' IS indeed different to Ashe's 'Frost' therefore if the rule was to be broken and anivia's Frostbite dealt double damage to targets with ashe's 'frost' then the 'poison' rule would not apply either and Cass would have all the previously mentioned champions reset her E. (also by default Urgots Q would be homing on all those abilities too) its similar to Yasuo's wind wall, regardless of what the ability actually is, if it is named a projectile then it is blocked, Ezreals Ult which is an ult and does mega damage is blocked, where xerath's Q which is a non-ultmate ability on a short cooldown and deals less damage isn't blocked, you'd think it would make more sense balance wise to work the other way around, but because of the wording of yasuo's wall, one ability is blocked and the other isn't. \nMorale: wording is important,\n\nAnd of course this doesn't only affect anivia, \"if a door is opened it can be crossed through from both sides\" which means ashe's basic attacks would crit on targets afflicted with anivia's 'chilled' and Rylai's slow as well, which would be kinda slightly OP, anivia would stun a target and ashe could crit straight away. Even if anivia wasn't in the game, if someone had rylai's ashe would crit on them too, Sejuani could also use her permafrost on targets with rylai's or ashe/anivia slows, and henceforth ashe and anivia could get bonus damage off her passive effect too, not to mention that Anivia's R is AoE and would allow ashe to crit instantly on the whole team, and allow Sej to slow everyone.\n\nin short a change like you suggest not only tips the scales even more so in the favour of an already very powerful mage (anivia) but in applying the change you affect several other aspects of the game, (RIOT's balancing team has it harder than you think aye) \n\nalthough i do see where you are coming from don't get me wrong, (i still believe lee sin shouldnt be affected by blind) and in my opinion i believe that anivia should be able to use her buffed E against the dragon, but she cant because dragon is immune to CC and thus isn't affected by 'chilled'. My problem with this is that 'chilled' isn't a form of CC but 'Slow' is, so dragon should block the 'slow' aspect of chilled but not the 'chilled' part. An example would be Azir's Q, yes it has a slow but dragon doesn't block the whole ability does it?","replies":[{"poster":"Plasmarine","date":"2015-09-07T04:45:04.831+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I actually enjoyed reading this.. Although I am guilty of somewhat skim reading parts of it cause I'm actually very sleep deprived atm.\nBut I see what you're saying about poisons..\nSimply allowing Anivia to proc double E damage on Ashe's frosted targets wouldn't be allowed and I agree 100% on that. I was thinking they change one of the debuffs to the same debuff. e.g. They both apply frost, or both applied chilled. And the description of Anivia's E is instead changed to \"frosted\" or \"chilled\" whichever the other is changed to. By no means should this apply to every champion with a similar effect JUST because it slows them.\nIMO the only champions that could -or- should apply frost/chilled would be: Ashe, Anivia, Braum, Lissandra, Nunu, Sejuani and Trundle.\nThis is probably cause I'm a fan of games with status effects like poisoned, burned, frozen etc, so I'd personally like them to be the same and there to be more benefits from said effects ^^\n\nEven if they did apply this change though the chances a random Anivia would end up on the same team as one of the other 6 champions I listed would be pretty damn low (since there's another whole 120 champions to chose from) -unless- it was an organised comp with that strategy in mind so even if this 'buff' goes ahead I really don't think you'll ever have to worry about it. :)","replies":[{"poster":"TeCoolMage","date":"2015-09-08T13:15:52.721+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yeah...

Of course of there was an ashe in the team it would be different, 1 volley and their whole team is wide open for your E. Or you miss Q and R is on CD and you have nothing but a wall to play with vsing a yasuo who's after your soul, if ashe hits him with a long range volley tho then you can half his health instantly and give him second thoughts.\n\nthe only difference between yellow and blue slows is the visual effect, they put ice slows on ice champs for the same reason they put fire particles on brands passive.
