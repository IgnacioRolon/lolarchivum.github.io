Just keep the reality in, a gank is great when it's a 2v1 fight, but not when it's a towerdive or a 1v1 fight.\nImpact means they will not gank if there is too little to gain from it. If you're way behind or the enemy is fed, then the gank is purely a containment attempt. If the enemy is awful (or complains about getting camped), a gank is a lot more likely, as the guy looks like an easy kill and possibly a tower, which would help you and your team a lot.\n\nBasically, if you can't (one would expect \"win your lane\", but that's overshooting) face your opponent somehow decently, a gank won't help you, and won't arrive.\n\nI'd suggest to either sit back under tower and farm, or SWAP your lane with someone more suited for that matchup before it is too late.","replies":[{"poster":"JasonWazza","date":"2015-07-14T11:22:52.736+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":">I'd suggest to either sit back under tower and farm, or SWAP your lane with someone more suited for that matchup before it is too late.\n\nAs a note, only do this if you CAN face their laner instead.","replies":[{"poster":"Ediwir","date":"2015-07-15T06:34:23.972+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Well, hopefully if you're not 0-4 and it's just a matchup problem you will.\nOfc if you're just going to fail anyways, it mightn't be worth to feed two lanes instead of just one.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"JasonWazza","date":"2015-07-14T10:53:26.228+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"Sit back, Farm with ability's, stay safe, CS under turret.\n\nAll you need to do is stay in EXP range, sure your giving up gold, but your not giving that laner more gold by kills.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Only Heimer","date":"2015-07-16T09:44:45.074+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"you proceed to flame and blame the jungler for everything. make sure you tell them that they're the worst jungler you've  ever seen.","replies":[{"poster":"TeCoolMage","date":"2015-07-16T09:50:18.374+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I wish that worked.
