The monsters are already very hard to beat and therefore should have more gold rewards, and the jungler gets kills from pretty much all lanes rather than one due to ganks, why are they poorer or a level behind compared to mid or top? Despite all of this, along with the fact they have to buy items specifically suited for juggling, they manage to scale into late game as well as top, how does a jungler with more CS items and one less level participate in team fights so flawlessly?\r\n\r\nI don&#039;t question the power of the jungle, though. They&#039;re a pretty scary bunch.","replies":[{"poster":"JasonWazza","date":"2015-07-03T19:15:47.009+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The problem is you can't scale jungle up without champions like Yi and Shyvana starting to rule the jungle by power farming.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Jink","date":"2015-07-03T17:07:41.206+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Junglers get more efficiency out of their items so are scaled as such, because they can essentially use almost every last bit of HP to continue to maintain levelling up and farming and as such once they start getting into the flow of things if they come out on top after a team fight kiss your jungle and buffs goodbye, along with Dragon; so they need to get relatively little out of the Jungle and their summoner spells and itemization so that they don't become too strong if they do develop an advantage.","replies":[]}]}
