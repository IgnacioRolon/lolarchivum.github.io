It just adds together.\n\nMikaels is expensive and you cant use it while you're CC'd if it's a hard CC and for that gold you could have a significant increase to your damage with AP.\n\nIt's not terrible to get both but really in most cases you benefit more from having an athenes and then heavy AP or maybe rod of ages or something or otherwise a morellos and then heavy AP. Spending a lot of gold for heaps of mana is rarely good because most fights end within about 10 seconds - far quicker than you could utilize that amount of mana regen usefully and you're missing out on a lot of damage. I prefer to rush an AP heavy item or morellos in some rare cases or athenes if im a spammer like Lux who is relatively squishy and can sit back and poke lots and is good with CDR (has sorta long cooldowns) and find the mana regen increase of athenes is better than morellos for her but its really situational, I just think heavy AP is better and these mana items are good as a 1st or 2nd buy or can even be skipped for just raw AP heavy builds and building two of them sets back your damage or defense too much.\n\nTear is a good buy vs AD mids for some spammers and Chalice is good vs AP mids as a spammer but I usually try to rush Needless and build heavy AP then consider buying one of the two, or rush one of the two (morellos or athenes) and then work on heavy AP to increase my damage.","replies":[]}]}
