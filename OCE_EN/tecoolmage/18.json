My masteries and runes are the same as my mid Xerath runes and masteries (but I make sure to be extremely silent on this matter, winkwinksuppsetup)\r\n\r\nI do my job as support slightly differently to other supports at first: I take teleport (and flash, cus it&#039;s the default.) to ensure the lane is never MIA and to let the ADC be more lenient on when to recall and when to farm. I take advantage of this by last hitting everything I can while the ADC is off buying items and slowly walking back to lane. I just poke the low mr enemy ADC until they recall or die to put them FAR behind. My mid setup makes my pokes ridiculous at early levels, and the fact the ADC is almost guaranteed to be AD and not MR (Hello Galio and Kassadin ADC, wait, you don&#039;t exist.)\r\n\r\nLeaning phase ends with me having 3k gold unused because I poked the enemy so hard they never damaged me more than my health regen and occasional potion could take, stopping me from needing to recall when teleport was on CD.\r\n\r\n If my ADC is a hyper carry who doesn&#039;t look quite strong enough to survive on her own mid game (Damnit, Vayne, I don&#039;t want to be your baby sitter), I buy twin shadows, an item that benefits both of us. I repeat the teleport-farming scheme and then I continue to the next step of my diabolical plan.\r\n\r\nIf the ADC is alright, l get on with it and continue to the next step.\r\n\r\nI buy Luden&#039;s Echo. The gold coin mixed with only 30-60 CS is enough for this bad boy. From there, I just use one Q to wave clear and get all the kill gold. If I haven&#039;t bought twin shadows, I buy it anyways to help my skill shots, chasing, and for the ADC.\r\n\r\nFrom there, I build as if I was mid the whole time, pushing all the lanes to their dooms, with everyone aiming for the over leveled mid or top while I secretly buy rabadon and void and become the third carry to destroy late game. The only difference between mid and I is the fact mid gets an extra level and an extra item&#039;s worth of gold. I get an ADC hugging me while we set the enemy on fire and take over the world. I also ward, but I always ward as mid, so I don&#039;t count it as a difference.\r\n\r\nOf course, I make sure to be more threatening than the ADC by hitting everyone in the center of my eye of destruction of doom W, so if someone falls behind, it&#039;s the Guy Who Was Meant To Support, not the actual carry.\r\n\r\n\r\nI think my win rate as support is actually higher than my mid win rate, so I&#039;m pretty happy with my strategy.","replies":[{"poster":"McRuthless","date":"2015-07-01T22:32:05.720+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Sightstone should be proritised over everything. Always. On any support. I cant stress how much you are disadvantaging you team by not buying this. Its only 800 gold for a huge amount of information over the game(plus it saves money on normal wards anyway). Buy damage after that if you want. \n\nGetting the AP support item instead of coin and switching teleport for exhaust/ignite/heal will make you more effective in fights but i guess isnt completely necessary.","replies":[{"poster":"TeCoolMage","date":"2015-07-02T00:01:26.856+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"AP support item? What's that?\n\nI usually use gold coin for the mana regen, and spell thief seems a bit lackluster, only 3 times every 30 seconds? Disabled on minion kill?\n\nWith sight stone... I used to buy it even with mid. But I somehow always fall far behind even after using 800 gold so I just buy stealth wards and ask the jg to ward top while I ward bot. There are very few games where I use more than 11 wards if the other players actually decide to pitch in (everyone should ward. If even the ADC isn't warding, that's a lot of potential lost for just 225 gold.)\n\nTeleport = more gold and the removal of MIA, there's very little trade for that when considering ignite and exhaust's max range is Xerath's danger zone. And potions.","replies":[{"poster":"Talon12","date":"2015-10-11T02:09:57.846+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"the coin is actually the least stat/gold efficient support item","replies":[{"poster":"TeCoolMage","date":"2015-10-12T08:20:37.919+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Dat activatable tho...

Its basically the same gold as first teir coin and significantly more when you upgrade to frostfang as long as you use the procs (and its not hard to hit someone 3 times in 30 seconds with a ranged champ). The additional 10 damage per hit is also fairly big for early poke and fighting. And disabling on minion kills shouldnt be an issue during laning phase anyway.\n\nWith regard to the sightstone, placing less than 11 wards during the game is SUPER low, even if the rest of your team is warding. You can have 3 out at a time, and they last 3 mins each, so it doesnt take long to surpass that if you're warding properly.","replies":[{"poster":"TeCoolMage","date":"2015-07-03T15:32:13.091+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Wow, I never bothered doing the math, but my endgame stats always seem lower than I expect.
