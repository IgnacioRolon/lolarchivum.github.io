It is REALLY GOOD and even the tanks get too scared to go frontline.","replies":[{"poster":"Jink","date":"2015-08-10T17:55:36.095+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You can do many things, but keep in mind if you make your team AP Heavy - they can just stack Magic resist and negate a lot of your damage which is why mixed damage is popular so maybe if you have an AD Mid, although I suggest you do a duo AP Bot like Ziggs and Veigar but keep in mind you have to secure kills or the game may snowball against you and even in doing this - again you are making your team heavy AP which is semi-easy to counter so your team would probably have to pick around you for it to be a good idea.\n\nIf they see it coming or have simply picked counters and MR heavy/type champs you may have a problem - that is avoided in balanced team comps. Plus you may still face the problem of counters, counter-building or MR synergizing Champs that are more than happy to face you.","replies":[]},{"poster":"JasonWazza","date":"2015-08-10T11:16:34.462+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Or he could just go top/mid and farm, you know, cause his not that good in the bot lane as the carry.\n\nIf you want to replace the ADC, you have to replace it with something like ziggs, as your ADC is a major source of Seigeing.","replies":[{"poster":"GigaPube","date":"2015-08-10T13:26:49.411+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"the point of an adc is sustained dps especially in a teamfight. also if veigar blows his abilities and doesnt kill them the adc can turn around and auto them to death. his stun is pretty predictable now so its not like he can poke them down. his ulti is also not as effective on them","replies":[{"poster":"JasonWazza","date":"2015-08-10T15:30:21.438+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Except for the fact that if that was the case you could replace an ADC with someone who does sustained DPS (Think Cassio and Orianna for examples) however we then come to the fact that this isn't really why we have an ADC.\n\nSiege potential is basically the only reason ADC's stay meta.","replies":[]}]}]}]}
