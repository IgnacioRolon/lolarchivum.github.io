I&#039;d really be interested in a viable Bard Jungle, Soraka mid, Janna top, etc.","replies":[{"poster":"Project Xayah","date":"2015-07-23T12:48:55.564+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I've seen a few good Bard/Soraka/Janna mages and a Draven or two do well top (low elo, but still). Every champion can be effective in two or three positions as a minimum but it depends on circumstance. Some strategies are used more than others because they're effective at a more levels of play, rather than just bronze/silver MMR (or even on the flip side, master/challenger MMR), and in a larger variety of circumstances.","replies":[{"poster":"TeCoolMage","date":"2015-07-24T07:25:15.067+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Now I want to make a Soraka top build and see how well it goes... \n\n_a few minutes later..._\n\nWarning. This is a very trolly build and requires at least your jungler to be a tank because top won't be one.\n---\nDesc:\n\nWith the 5.13 items update, Liandry has slightly more AP and Rylais works amazing with AoE. I think Soraka is now viable for top. Mid is a bit too poke-heavy early game so you can get behind very easily while top melee tanks are easy to deal with. She scales veryyyy badly into late game when it comes to damage so she's more of \"Shut down the enemy laner, shut down the jungle, you've done all you can!\" than \"YES I OHKO THE TANK WITH PERCENTAGE TRUE DAMAGE, 100% MAX HP!\"\n\nEdit: After playing a few games, I found out she scales AMAZING into late game. Despite her lack of damage, even I you go for an MPen build her heals are not affected by MR while having similar numbers to nukes and heal more than 50% health on non-tanks in 1.5 seconds at max ranks. Her damage is horrible with full AP, though. Her solo lane experience also gives her more levels than what she's balanced in for duo lanes so her heals are ridiculous, I always max W first because the sustain it gives is amazing and turns you into an off-tank.\n\n---\nPros:\n- Sustain in lane\n- Jungler snowballs easier\n- ~~The tank top on the enemy team will think you're a scrub and you'll get first blood.~~ Edit: Nope you won't even get kills even if they try to feed on purpose, unless a turret helps.\n\nEdit:\n- E zoning potential and mini burst with Rylai tends to scare the enemy a lot. It's very high-damage and scary looking despite being the only good damaging ability in her kit.\n- Despite your horrible damage, you can be an APC because your effective DPS is how long you can keep the other carries alive. \n- Bananas. They don't have any mechanical advantage, but they keep morale up as they give justification for building AD on a Mage and that stops them from feeling hopeless and going on tilt.\n- You can be an AD tank if built right\n- You're a pony.\n- Her sustain is amazing. I must mention it again, because it's simply that good. Might as well play her instead of Mundo if you're good at mages instead of tanks. She's like Vladimir except she can give her sustain to other guys.\n\nCons:\n- {{summoner:14}} You'll get flamed and that will remove a lot of your potential.\n- If you get an AP top, like Maokai, expect to see morello\n- AP ratios are a joke for damage and MPen does nothing to healing.\n- All the useful AP items that give on-spell effects give HP\n- HP is bad for Soraka, and is the only champ to actually get worse if you build a stat. Rito pls fix.\n\nEdit:\n- HP is also a bad stat for everyone else in the team because it reduces the total amount of healing. Aim for the high defense tanks rather than high HP tanks. Unless they have spirit visage. Then hug them till the end of the world.\n- With the non-AD builds, expect to only get one or two kills _in the entire game_ and steal a few assists by secretly casting R when everyone is below max health but winning a team fight anyway.\n\n---\n Items:\nFeel free to mix. All the builds listed are of extremes. If you're interested in taking your own path, these are the things to look for, in no particular order:\n1. Low HP\n2. High MS Percentage\n3. Unit improvement or creation\n4. Self healing \n5. Not AP focused, preferably MPen\n6. On-spell effects\n7. On-heal effects\n8. CC\n9. CDR\n10. Mana\n\n\nStart:\n\nThe start is really dependant on what you take first. If you take W first to spam on your jungler and on minions to be annoying and deny CS, take flask, bead or shield. If you take starcall and play the traditional mage strategy, take ring. Yellow trinket is alright.\n\n>{{item:1056}} OR {{item:1054}} OR {{item:2041}} OR {{item:1006}} AND {{item:3340}}{{item:2003}} \n\nBuilds:\n\n- A. Pushing\n\nThis build focuses on making a minion push like an ADC, then spamming W on it while under tower. Good for split push comps.\n\n>Core:\n{{item:3285}} {{item:3060}} AND/OR {{item:3512}}\nChoices:\n{{item:2137}} {{item:3056}}\n\n- B. Sustained Damage AP\n\nThis build focuses on sustained damage. It's pretty good considering the fact Soraka doesn't have high AP ratios. Good for poke comps.\n\n>Core:  \n{{item:3174}} OR {{item:3165}} AND {{item:3151}} {{item:3003}} {{item:3135}}\nChoices:\n{{item:1311}} OR {{item:1331}} \n\n- C. Sustained Mixed Damage\n\nThis build also focuses on sustained damage, just take most of the sustained AP items with these choices and you'll be good to go. Don't bother with full AP, go for on-spell and on-hit effects along with MPen, mana regen and maximum CDR. The idea is that bananas are cool and Soraka can potentially deal more DPS with her auto attacks and simply use her kit for utility purposes. Iceborn gauntlet recommended because her CC is horrible.\n\n>Core:\n{{item:3025}} \nChoices:\n {{item:3508}} {{item:3091}} {{item:3115}} {{item:3100}} \n\n- D. Full damage\n\nAgain, don't focus on AP, Rabadon is optional if you don't want Rylai.\n\n>Core:\n{{item:3151}} {{item:3135}} {{item:1311}}\nChoices:\n{{item:3089}} {{item:3116}} {{item:3003}} {{item:3174}} OR {{item:3165}}\n\nExtra\n\nTake defense if you lock in first and your team is a complete bunch of bozos and take no tanks. Get utility if you work really well with your jungler, or if you have trouble with using push build. Sustain is good if you find you need more HP.\n\n>Defense:\n{{item:3102}} {{item:3110}} {{item:3023}} {{item:3157}} \nUtility:\n{{item:3504}} {{item:1326}} {{item:1306}} \nSustain:\n{{item:3146}} {{item:3152}}\n\nEdit: I don't think full AP is ever good because you're in a solo lane, unless your jg is amazing and camps your lane while never being on the bottom side of the map. Two Faerie Charms are also good early on because you'll get more mana problems than health problems in lane.\n\n---\nAbilities:\n\n - Q - Take for the damage, not much else to say. Sometimes you can take E instead. Only cast when below 50% health if you don't have Athenes or Morello. I actually don't think you should max it first unless you rush Void Staff, as the MP increases and 0.5 seconds isn't much, along with the damage increase.\n - W - Your jungler will love you if you take this, but use it VERY sparingly as he will appear to need a heal when he has a lot more mitigation in non-health methods like armour and MR, along with the fact he won't be next to you in lane to hold it for you so you should be careful with when you recall. Also take for the Q heals.\n - E - You can put ranks in this even though supports max it last. It scales better at all levels, and it appears immediately while costing less mana in general. Unfortunately, it has a huge cooldown. Get Rylai ASAP if you take this to deal double damage consistently, then rush Athene (Not Morello, that's only good if you're maxing W or Q) immediately.\n - R - It's an ult... Put ranks in when possible... Use when health is low in a teamfight... ALSO, don't play as if you're playing to save an ADC's life, if YOU are low health, use this because you're in a solo lane and there's another support on the team.\n\nEdit: I didn't emphasize the Q heals on W ranks enough. MAX IT FIRST, HEALING MINIONS IS OP AND THE SUSTAIN IS BETTER THAN ANY OTHER CHAMP IN THE GAME!!!! Also, E doesn't affect minions so it sucks until you get Rylai. Don't take E then Rylai, take Rylai then E.\n\n---\nRunes:\nAlways go scaling on runes, seals and marks so you don't become useless too quickly with your horrible AP ratios and lack of CC. Scaling quintessences suck, go flat.\n\n\n- Full HP Regen seals if you got a good jungler, otherwise go with armour or mana regen\n- MR Glyphs, sometimes you can go AP if you're desperate for damage, have a good jungler OR if you rush AP scaling items\n- MPen marks are great, hybrid if you go mixed damage, or AD if you're a bad last hitter.\n- Quintessences should be MPen because they're better than AP for damage. You can also go HP Regen if you have a good jungler. Only go AP if you worship him like a god and would gladly risk your laning for him.\n\nEdit: Too poor to afford new quintessences but AP is fine if you can play with less damage early on. It makes you much more annoying because it increases your W heals and let's you deny a lot more farm\n---\nStrategy:\n\nEarly Game: Last hit enemy minions and heal your own minions when you see the enemy laner going in to last hit, then let his minions KS it by poking with Q if he remains persistent, then roam and ~~gank~~ heal mid + bot. If your jungler is a carry jungler, you can be heal him when roaming, and if your jungler is a counter jungler or ganking jungler, you can join him in his adventures! Sustain playstyle with Soraka shines in this part of the game, snowball by farming a ton.\n\nEdit: learnt this the hard way: Only do so when you have TP up. Your pushing is horrible so don't expect to roam until you get Athenes, or have mana regen runes, so you can spam Q as E and W do nothing to the minion wave.  Or take AD.\n\nMid game: Try to banana yourself a few kills and heal as many lanes as possible to get a hoarde of minions into all the towers. Utility playstyle with Soraka shines in this part of the game, ardent will make your roam heals matter a lot and the boots will help you get between lanes quicker\n\nLate game: Spam W, hit E, and win game! Defense playstyle with Soraka shines in this part of the game, as you can afford to get into frontlines of a teamfight more often, use your Rylai or Liandry augmented Q, then use E on their CC'd survivors.\n---\nI can't wait for someone to try this, actually. I suck at most champs so I won't be a good example if I win or lose.\n\nOMG Y RITO, Y U MEK RYLAI & LIANDRY GIVE HP\n\nI request 1 thing: Soraka's E gives a passive, a percentage of her maximum health is converted into Flat MPen and her maximum health is lowered by the same amount depending on her MPen. Percentage scales with E ranks and possibly with AP. This solves the problem with Soraka being the only champ that is affected negatively by a stat while not letting her stack it in a way that causes problems (Tank Soraka).

I think full AP would work better mid due to her ridiculous healing potential, but she'd be great at AD at top.\n\nAnd as someone who sucks at most champs, I think a decent player can go very far with her.\n\nHer top healing is so ridiculous, I once had a Soraka fight against a support Soraka who had talisman of ascension, rabadons and frozen heart, while I had Rylai, sorc treads and haunting guise. She just poked me with 8~ Qs and 3 Es and I missed all of mine until near the end of it.
