And Teemo.","subforum":"Miscellaneous","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"**WARNING** you are about to see some terrible exaggerated jokes and face palm worthy statements. If you suffer from any medical disorder and/or \"FML How can I live a world like this\" syndrome, please do not read any further\n\nI was reading through the Tahm Kench quotes and trivia in the wiki, and found out he&#039;s either related to, or as old as Tahm Kench, both being demons who represent the bad side of humanity. Tahm Kench represented an individual&#039;s flaws and weaknesses, while Aatrox represented the flaws of a large group of people, through war and fights between nations.\n\nI thought to myself, \"Neither of these guys are as evil as... Teemo...\"\n\nThen I realized, Teemo was also a demon! He represented the flaws that were not in nations, or even individuals, he represented the evil that was inevitable and would not end even if people ceased to exist. His mushrooms are a metaphor for the inevitableness of death, as mushrooms only live for a few days, as long as the carcass or dead matter they live on still contains nutrients, and the poison his mushrooms explode into are manifestations of the slow death all beings are doomed to experience. He is present everywhere, thus he manifests himself as a yordle, a being of purity and kindness. Rito has obviously been planning the rise of Teemo since the dawn of LoL.\n\nTeemo isn&#039;t any evil, he&#039;s **The** Evil.","replies":[{"poster":"Bipolar","date":"2015-07-20T09:08:42.766+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Could you get off 2010 jokes and make some new ones?
