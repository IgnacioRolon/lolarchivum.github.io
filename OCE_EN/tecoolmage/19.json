I tend to get 120-180 CS at 20 mins but it stagnates to 150-210 CS by 30 mins. Then I split push and get to around 240 CS by 40 mins.\n\nAre you expected to maintain the 150-200 CS per 20 mins rule the entire game, even when pushing to nexus and grouping?","replies":[{"poster":"Olee","date":"2015-09-23T22:11:34.870+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"It depends on the champ you're playing to be honest. As a mid lane main, if I'm playing Ahri, a roamer with good waveclear, I'll end up with about 120-130 by 20.  As Ori or Viktor, I don't roam much and just farm and I end up with about 150-160 by 20. As LB I roam a fucktonne and I have minimal waveclear and I end up with about 100-ish by 20.","replies":[{"poster":"ƒamous","date":"2015-09-25T12:25:43.578+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"LeBlanc, even without roaming is extremely hard to cs with too, unless you use abilities, which wastes your mana. 100 isn't too bad by 20, I usually end up with a lot less than that.","replies":[{"poster":"Olee","date":"2015-09-26T05:52:50.720+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Well if the wave sits right, a W-R will clear the whole wave. R is free and is on a very short cooldown and W is also on a short cooldown.

How should I keep up with CSing by the time teamfights start?\n\nAlso I heard LeBlanc's auto attacks have a great animation or something like that, is it really normal to CS with abilities (when farming specifically and not pushing is the goal) because I always use auto attacks even on Anivia and Soraka (not supp Soraka).","replies":[{"poster":"Olee","date":"2015-09-30T20:52:08.290+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"That is something I tend to sometimes struggle with also to be honest with you. I find that just being aware of the minimap's waves helps and doing Raptors whenever you can.\n\nYes they definitely do! One of the best out of all AP Mid laner's I've ever played. Yes it perfectly normal, few reasons why you would do it. Let's use Leblanc as an example. In lane phase you might want to farm with W because there are two or three really low minions next to each other and you wouldn't have gotten them all otherwise. Or you farm with Q because you AA'd the minion too early and you'd miss it otherwise (quicker animation). Or try and waveclear as fast as you can because you wanna buy (always do this). Or you want to make sure the enemy laner misses out on gold and exp since they are at a roam. Or YOU wanna roam. General rule of thumb, whenever you're leaving lane, shovr first.","replies":[{"poster":"TeCoolMage","date":"2015-09-30T22:59:00.243+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I was always aware of shoving the lane (which is why I said farming and not pushing in my comment) but had no clue on using abilities to farm when auto attacks won't get them all.
