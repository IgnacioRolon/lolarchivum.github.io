As others have said, waveclear is generally helpful.\n\nLong duration silences and being hard to kill helps, too. {{champion:31}}  and {{champion:90}} match up pretty well against her, assuming you can avoid ganks. Both of them can push the wave, usually build Rod of Ages for tankiness, and have silences if she goes in on you.","replies":[{"poster":"TeCoolMage","date":"2015-06-28T05:52:31.374+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The question specifically says blind pick...

It's actually much easier to lane against her now. \nYou can dodge distortion by walking towards her. \nShe's squishy and quick to kill if caught with a stun or silence, think fiddlesticks and Ekko. \nHer Q lets her do a lot of damage, if you can dodge her other abilities you should take a lot of damage. \nGo read her abilities so you know what she does.","replies":[]}]}
