All of its damage is from the poison. This has been tested experimentally in custom games posted to YouTube and it's right there in the ability description itself.

Well, the arming timer is longer so I can't just walk and place mushrooms every so often while being chased.","replies":[{"poster":"Strat","date":"2015-07-28T14:30:17.757+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The range at skill rank 2 and 3 is a lot longer too though, so it shouldn't be too hard. Even at rank  1 you can still put a mushroom on the other side of the wall and run around it while it arms.\n\nFrom memory the original range was 250 at all ranks, now it's 300 -> 600 -> 900. So at level 11 you'll have more than twice the extra distance to run, the double arming time shouldn't be a big deal then. In fact, at level 16 you can kinda trick the enemy more easily since you can place it out of the enemy's vision range and by the time they get there they won't know you placed it.","replies":[{"poster":"Zorphiax","date":"2015-07-30T06:44:35.473+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"But then there are smart summoners who don't chase teemo just like singed","replies":[{"poster":"Strat","date":"2015-07-30T07:48:31.519+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It's not just chasing though. You can be so much smarter with Teemo than just kiting with shrooms. You can plant shrooms to the sides of minions at the enemy's side of the river so that the minions (hopefully) don't trigger them, but the enemy will. You can (obviously) use them as wards against ganks. You can use them to zone by putting them on top of you so that you can AA harass without retaliation.\n\nThere's other aspects to Teemo too - for example, when to Q. Also, the Q/W leveling tradeoff - the skill order of Teemo isn't as clear as other champs, as sometimes it's better to max W for the mobility, and other times you need to max Q after E to win trades.\n\nAlso, item builds. The most common item build is Liandries into 40% CDR into Void Staff, but a good Teemo adapts for team composition and matchup. You can just as easily go AD Bruiser Teemo with BotRK + FMallet, on hit Teemo with Liandries + FMallet + Nashor's + Wit's End, and more. Mastering the situational built Teemo is when you truly start to learn to be a demon.\n\nYou're not qualified to talk about Teemo when you're extreme low Elo, sorry.","replies":[{"poster":"Zorphiax","date":"2015-07-30T07:56:18.456+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Oh, I'm sorry I been playing with high golds/plats/low diamonds last few games and if you been playing LoL with your eyes closed last 3 seasons you may notice that silver+ is full of diamond+ smurfs.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Chicken4dinner","date":"2015-07-27T21:59:44.239+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yeah, like teemo's poison e.
