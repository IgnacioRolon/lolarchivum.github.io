With his Q damage buff, imagine being able to solo lane without being harassed from range and doing 3 autos for over 3k damage. Imagine adding the ability to heal too...\n\nHis Q damage is already BS. The only reason Riot gave it to him was because they knew in a melee v ranged match he shouldn't be able to use it often but when he does, look out.\n\nHonestly think Riot were thinking about the Pro's and the \"2v1 meta\". Wouldn't be suprised if you see top laners learn morde and lane with the supp while the ADC solo lanes against the enemy top laner.\n\nMaybe even \"double jungle\" morde since his healing is 100% of damage done to monsters/champions. Why not full clear the jungle with the jungler, both stay healthy, go top, share the wave... hmmm... needs more thought. ","replies":[]}]}
