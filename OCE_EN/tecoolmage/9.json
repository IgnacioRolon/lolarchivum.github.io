In fact, I sometimes get killed because a minion was smart enough to aggro me and deal that one point of damage to let the enemy catch up. \n\nI want to be able to chase and roam effectively in mid, should I switch to boots of swiftness by default, or is it a situational pick against CC only? I want to make sure I have a lot of MS so I take luden and twin shadows to increase it, so the differences between the two boots gets a lot bigger.\n\nI also always take distortion + flash + ghost because ignite is too mainstream. Is alacrity better?\n\nIf it matters, I tend to play immobile mages like {{champion:101}} {{champion:161}}","replies":[{"poster":"kJs","date":"2015-07-15T16:32:17.130+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"You're not even supposed to get ignite on Xerath because if you're close enough to ignite then you're too close and not far away, I'm not sure if that applies to Vel'Koz though.

I think if it works for you then you should keep it, could be new meta/strategy that no one has tried yet. If you were to take Teleport instead of ghost, you should probably go for Homeguards over Distortion. Alacrity isn't really as useful as Homeguards in my opinion. Homeguards get you to your lane faster and helps you defend your base/jungle quicker. I usually don't take Alacrity often. Furor provides better movement speed during combat and Homeguards lets me get into the action faster. I think you should drop Alacrity and go for Homeguards more often. \nThough I don't main neither of those champions so I can understand the importance of Alacrity in staying away.","replies":[{"poster":"TeCoolMage","date":"2015-07-16T07:33:56.624+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=kJs,realm=OCE,application-id=FjGAIbRv,discussion-id=RGp0LFlO,comment-id=0002,timestamp=2015-07-15T16:32:17.130+0000)\n>\n> You're not even supposed to get ignite on Xerath because if you're close enough to ignite then you're too close and not far away, I'm not sure if that applies to Vel'Koz though.

Xerath just sucks with ignite compared to other champs.\n\nI don't ever take ignite on either, anyway. Ghost, teleport and flash 4 life\n\nNow that I think about it, I never really play Xerath as a mage who just does a ton of damage... I play him as support+assassin with high mobility and at least 2 extra debuffs on my abilities from items","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"JasonWazza","date":"2015-07-14T10:51:32.051+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":">When I get CCd a lot I take boots of swiftness\n\nYou what?\n\nMercury's are for getting CC'd.\n\n> If it matters, I tend to play immobile mages like {{champion:101}} {{champion:161}}\n\nThen why are you running mobi's?\n\nThese guys want Pen boots, 60 move speed isn't that big a difference, if you were playing Annie i could understand as a tibbers every time it's up in a random lane is amazing, but these aren't guys that need that sort of mobility, and you lose the effectiveness of your boots past 20ish minutes as in a siege your poking more often then mobi's proc.\n\nAnd as a note, for the first 5 seconds of starting your roam (as you probably just shoved TOO roam) your not getting the mobi's, so your getting it for maybe half of the trip, canceling out the buy.","replies":[{"poster":"TeCoolMage","date":"2015-07-14T11:00:54.903+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Not hard CC, just a lot of slows and soft CC. I also don't like +45 movement speed... I'm not usually in the range for targeted hard CC.\n\n\nI know it seems odd, but I've started winning more often with MS builds than AP. It negates the weakness of playing an immobile mage. I also build Liandry in my default build for MPen and HP tanks, and take all magic penetration marks.\n\nImagine if Arcanopulse didn't slow you down. The chasing possibilities would be endless. (mobility doesn't reset until you finish charging it up, I'm pretty sure. I'd immediately switch to swiftness if it did reset at Q chargeup.)\n\nSorcerer's Treads are kinda boring. Sorry. I also don't build Rabadon unless I'm going for an \"all 6 items have AP\" build (no boots have AP), so what do I know?\n\nI just prefer utility over direct damage. Liandry + Rylai + Boots is much better than Rabadon + Void staff + Luden's in my opinion.","replies":[{"poster":"JasonWazza","date":"2015-07-14T15:56:27.674+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'm fine with that being the case on vel'koz but are you really building that on Xerath?\n\nAnd rabadon's is like a 40% power spike, why would you not build one?","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"BarryButcher","date":"2015-07-14T14:22:14.528+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Swiftis only stop slows.

Even if the minions hit you, they are made for roaming around and getting to another lane and back really fast.\n\nI would say unless your a champion that uses their flash/ghost aggressively, like Twisted Fate or Annie, I'd go with Alacrity.\n\nPlaying Xerath and Velkoz, i'd probably be going Ionian boots with Alacrity. But thats me. I'm not really a roamer. Especially wouldn't do so with those champions.\nI mean with Xerath you only need to walk 1/4 of the way to another lane with Ult right?","replies":[]}]}
