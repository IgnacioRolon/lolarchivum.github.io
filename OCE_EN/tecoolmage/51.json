Most champs who can get into {{champion:101}} range are gap closers who deal physical damage, so is taking armour seals instead of MR seals perfectly fine for mid, even though most mid champs are magic damage, or should I try to fit them somewhere else? I&#039;d be willing to mix and match some MR if it&#039;s really required.\r\n\r\nMy quintessences are always flat AP, but the MS quintessences look really nice, and I tend to stack MS for fun. I might change in the future\r\n\r\nMy marks are always flat MPen, non-percentage MPen is a REALLY rare stat, and I rarely auto attack later in game. Full MPen marks usually leaves me with half a Liandry&#039;s worth of MPen. ArPen doesn&#039;t seem as useful as flat AD if I really need it as I barely do any damage with AA anyway.\r\n\r\nMy seals are currently being worked on and are flat mana regen. I kinda want to keep mana regen but I _know_ I need armour when I get to ranked. It works perfectly in normal mode though, it gives me the sustain I need to spam pokes and get the enemy laner to recall early.\r\n\r\nWhat should I change to get my runes to barely scrape the line for _viable_, while not radically changing it too much? It works perfectly fine for me right now but I want to see what changes I can make.","replies":[{"poster":"DKDESTINY","date":"2015-07-19T00:32:34.040+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Im assuming this is for ranked.
