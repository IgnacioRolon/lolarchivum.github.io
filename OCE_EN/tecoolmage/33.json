Runglaive instantly makes auto attacks matter and I actually do better in Xerath jg than I do in top and occasionally support. The only argument I ever get is \"NO SUSTAIN CAN&#039;T COMPUTE\" even though Diana doesn&#039;t have spell vamp by default, and I don&#039;t see much Akali or Nami jungle.\n\nI can&#039;t wait for someone to make a video on Soraka jungle. I&#039;d really be amazed if someone manages to play her in ranked successfully.","replies":[{"poster":"DiamondAries","date":"2015-07-22T11:04:14.944+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Well, I'm going to be 'that guy' and say that technically any champ can jungle. But to be really successful then you need a form of healing or damage mitigation, otherwise you'll just keep getting forced to back. Plus, if the enemy picks a jungler like Udyr or Shaco, then you'll just get invaded and starved the entire game. Sure a champion might be a good jungler once they hit 6, but people forget that they actually need to hit the point, and a good jungler will capitalise on your moments of weakness and take your jungle unimpeded.","replies":[{"poster":"TeCoolMage","date":"2015-07-22T11:44:05.927+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"If you get a very high waveclear and range champ like Ziggs, can you theoretically have a good chance at getting at a good level if you use your range + knockback + ranger's trailblazer smite to mitigate damage rather than traditional defense stats? What's stopping me from rushing trailblazer as soon as possible (I usually get it on my first or second back) and then using waveclears to clear the camps so fast invading is difficult?\n\nOr is it only restricted to auto attack AP champs like Fizz and Diana (who don't have that much mitigation, actually)\n\nAlso, can Malzahar jungle _effectively_ if he builds a mix of AD and AP, using his voidlings to tank damage?","replies":[{"poster":"DiamondAries","date":"2015-07-23T13:06:05.799+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"1. Fizz passive plus Playful/trickster mitigate damage, and Diana has a reliable shield.\n2. Theoretically you could do that with Ziggs, but the argument I am putting forward is that a good enemy jungler will identify that you are a weak jg at the beginning and starve you out, especially if they are a Rengar, Lee Sin or Udyr.\n3. Never played Malzahar before, so I really don't know.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"DianasGotSwag","date":"2015-07-23T09:20:31.968+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Brand and Fizz are both fine.

Even with a perfect leash (support tanks for them) they'll still loose insane amounts of health and may have to back early. Not to mention all it takes is a decent jungler to invade and you'll stay level 3 all game. But if you ignore all that, sure anyone can jungle.","replies":[]}]}
