NLR is still very expensive, even after the massive discount. AD guys usually get to shine at this part of the game (where AP casters are hoarding off their gold for those 1k rods) because they get AD scaling abilities like AP guys get AP scaling abilities, and auto attack to top it off. It's only late game past level 16 that AP get another power spike and their Rylais, Liandries and whatnot to catch up and instagib the ADC.\n\nI haven't looked too much at AD items, but I think they tend to have more tiers with things like crit and AS, while the most powerful AP items like rabadon simply come from a large amount of flat AP items that you can't build, and simply have to buy","replies":[{"poster":"JasonWazza","date":"2015-07-11T03:22:51.962+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":">The problem is, all their special effects come from stacking AP items, Luden's echo is made from NLR and Aether Wisp, neither have much of a special effect other than a bit of MS.

Is top lane for late game and bottom lane for early game? And what's the jungle??\n\nI'm mostly talking about Sheen, zeal and phage becoming triforce, phantom dancer or lichbane, while the closest to those three items are haunting guise, fiendish codex, and aether wisp to make Liandry's Torment, Twin shadows, or Luden's echo. They don't really have any special effects other than flat out giving stats, so sheen and phage are inherently better than them alone, if we don't consider the power of what they build into.","replies":[{"poster":"JasonWazza","date":"2015-07-11T13:45:53.486+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"What your failing to take into account is one thing, Specialization.\n\nThe fact that NLR is straight AP, means it's more power, whereas a Phages raw AD power is only worth 720G, sure it has health, but in terms of comparing them, your picking the wrong sort of items.\n\nAnd your over shadowing what stats make a good mid game.\n\nWhat can mid laners do mid game?\n\nRoam and make you disappear.\n\nWhat can an ADC do on a similar mid game?\n\nContinue to be babysat\n\nYet you just called the mid laner to be the one with a horrible mid game.\n\nHaving a Support baby sit you does not at all equate to having a Normal Early/Mid game\n\nBut lets compare a similar mid game state.\n\nI'm gonna give both an ADC, and an AP mid laner 5k Gold.\n\nADC will most likely Get either IE+pickaxe+longsword or Tri Force+Pickaxe+longsword.\n\nThat mid laner has a complete NLR item of their choice, another NLR and an Amp tome.\n\nSmart money is on the Mid laner to be in the better state.\n\nBut now lets actually look at what sort of games a lot of other champions have (and yes i am using stereotype lanes because they make this simpler).\n\nTop lane: early game your unkillable, your aim is to be the top lane island\nMid game your 1-2 items and your aim is to initiate fights with your CC and be a tank on the front line\nLate game your unkillable and aim to just CC priority targets and be an all round nuisance for the enemy team.\n\nJungle: Early game, your pretty glorified, you either have some CC and mediocre damage, or less CC and half decent damage.\nMid game, basically you just hit 6, enchant complete, your a walking ultimate, other then your above.\nLate game, your a utility based tank.\n\nNow i will agree this is selling the roles short in what they can actually do for a team, but this is what they do in a more solo aspect, but your also doing the same sort of thing for AP mid laners.\n\nComparing roles is going to always require slanting things, because each role brings different things and more over, each champion brings different things.\n\nDon't go trying to compare an Ahri to a Sejuani at 10 minutes in cause it's not going to make sense.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]}
