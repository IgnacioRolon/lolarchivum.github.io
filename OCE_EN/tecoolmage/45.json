The main changes would be: Maxing E can actually be viable, W is no longer the first ability to max all the time, and Q is alright. Also, make healing minions cost 1% health instead of 10%, unless they&#039;re buffed (banner of command and those mechs super minions), then it should cost 5%.\n\nThe fact the two items she best benefits from, Rylai and Liandry, decreases the effectiveness of her self healing, really sucks. Just make her never benefit from health bonuses if it really matters.\n---\nEDIT: I think I'll do math on Spirit Visage and Warmog's Armour, considering the W health costs with the healing increases. Rabadon's too.\n---\nFor reference, W costs 10% health and heals this much to yourself when landing a Q.\nHEAL: 25 / 35 / 45 / 55 / 65 (+ 40% AP)\nIncrease by 1% for every 1% health missing.\nMAXIMUM HEAL: 50 / 70 / 90 / 110 / 130 (+ 80% AP)\n\nTo outheal the cost of your W with starcall, you'd need AP Equal to:\nTotal Health = H\nAP = A\nW Ranks = R\nDamage Taken = D\n( H / 10 - [ 1 + ( 100 x D ) / H ] x { 15 + 10R } ) / ( [ 1 + 100 x D / H ] x 0.4 ) = A\nNo HP related Items:\nLevel 1: 69.5 - 3.625 AP to fully heal 1 use of W per starcall\nLevel 18: 301.25 - 69.375 AP to fully heal 1 use of W per starcall\n\nHer base HP is \n529 â€“ 1855\n\nHer base HP5 is \n2.5 - 11\n---\nRabadon's Deathcap\n+120 AP\n+35% AP\nAlone, it gives 162 AP.\n\ngives 0.35 AP for every 1 AP. Another way to think about it is that it increases all your AP ratios by 35%.\nYour healing when hitting a Starcall will be increased by 162 AP, treat the heals like this when you don't want to keep recalculating your total AP by multiplying a percentage, instead just add up the AP of the items and use these ratios:\nHEAL: 25 / 35 / 45 / 55 / 65 (+ 54% AP)\nIncrease by 1% for every 1% health missing.\nMAXIMUM HEAL: 50 / 70 / 90 / 110 / 130 (+ 108% AP)\n---\nWarmog:\n+1% health as HP5 and 3% health as HP5 out of combat\n+800 health\n\n+80 health cost to W,\n\n15.79 - 37.55 HP5 and 42.37 - 90.65 HP5 out of combat, if you have default HP and HP5 with only warmogs.\n+1 HP5 for every 100 health, and +1 HP5 for every, well, HP5. +7 HP5 if you have both Liandry and Rylai.\nSo with that in mind: The regen of Warmog with itself, Liandry, and Rylai, along with all the base stats is:\n22.79 - 44.55 HP5 and 49.37 - 97.65 HP5 out of combat\n\nYou'll need 200 - 100 more AP to make up for the extra W cost, depending on your missing health. \n\nThis, however, does not include the regen you get from waiting, so it may be beneficial to take it while having less than 150 extra AP. It would take around 8 seconds to get back the 10% in combat, if you don't hit Q at all, and 4 seconds out of combat. This isn't very good considering the fact your W has a 2 second cooldown at maximum ranks, Spirit Visage  \n---\nSpirit Visage:\n+100% HP5\n~~I'm pretty sure it stacks with the Warmog passive.~~ Wait, no. It's BASE regen.\n+20% Self heal\n+400 health\n+10% cooldown reduction\n+55 magic resistance\n\n+40 cost to W\nHealing changed to \nHEAL: 30 / 42 / 54 / 66 / 78 (+ 48% AP)\nIncrease by 1% for every 1% health missing.\nMAXIMUM HEAL: 60 / 84 / 108 / 132 / 156 (+ 96% AP)\nUsing these improved ratios and bases, the amount of AP you'd need to make up for the +40 HP cost for W is 72.9155 - 31.25\n\nAlso, HP Regen is changed from 2.5 - 11 to 6 - 26.4\n\nThis, combined with +55% effective HP against Magic damage and 10% shorter cooldowns.\n---\nI really recommend Spirit Visage as it just looks amazing on paper, but I have no clue on the efficiency of HP5 so I can't comment on Warmog. Rabadon's is a great pick too if you want sustain and healing while not having a terrible build path involving ruby crystals of pain.\n\nThese are all REALLY expensive, though, so I'm not sure if they'd be practical. Especially Rabadon's. 3.5k gold is a lot compared to 2.75k and 2.5k, while not helping you too much unless you're support. Conclusion: Rabadon's isn't useful enough if you're not support, and it's too expensive regardless of what lane you take.\n---\nOther items: If you have none of the above 3 items, every 100 HP requires you to have 25 - 12.5 AP more extra to make up for the HP. \n\nHaving both Rylai and Liandry requires you to have\n- 5 - -92.5 AP extra, if you count in the AP you already get from having these items. In other words, getting these items gives you 5 - 92.5 extra AP to get a Spirit Visage or something. This isn't much compared to the 100 - 100 AP you get from Luden's echo or Zhonya's Hourglass, so I'd recommend getting these first unless you're specifically interested in harassing champions by chaining E after Q and doing HP % damage.","replies":[{"poster":"JasonWazza","date":"2015-07-26T01:37:37.567+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Maxing E even in a solo lane is iffy, if it works on minions, then yeah but having it work on minions isn't a good thing in my opinion.\n\nJust max Q>W>E and she doesn't even need a Rylai's because her Q has a slow if your accurate with it.\n\nAs a note, your E is utility/Zoning, not a offensive spell, use it as such.\n\nIf your going top your build is likely\n\nRing/Flask + Pots > Seekers/Challice (if first item needs to be a defense cause your behind) > Morello > Frozen Heart/Spirit Visage (make the call on game state)\n\nCore Build:\nMorello\nPen boots\nFrozen Heart\nSpirit Visage\nZhonya's Hourglass\n\nUsable items:\nIceborn Gauntlet\nAthene's\nBanner\nAbysall\n\n\n\nMid build is different, because mid is a completely different role.\n\nRing+Pots > Athene's/Morello > Luden's/Zhonya's (if required) > Void Staff > Deathcap\n\nCore:\nMorello/Athene's (one or the other, never both)\nLuden's\nVoid Staff\nDeathcap\nPen boot's\nZhonya's\n\nUsable:\nAbysall\nCDR boots\nSpirit Visage","replies":[{"poster":"TeCoolMage","date":"2015-07-26T04:02:46.361+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"There's nothing better than zoning people off minions by casting E directly on them, but starcall doesn't deal nearly enough damage to do anything to minions, so E really should affect minions, at least by 50% damage or something.

I'd understand if it's amazing early game on enemy champions, but its combined mana cost, cooldown, and non-minion sustain makes it bad for pushing at any part of the game. Also, you're so fragile taking ranks in W is required to let you make up for the lack of tanks other than jg, as top won't be a bruiser or tank. I literally do more pushing with my AA than Q.\n\nI also did some math and found out that taking Rabadon's is only good for the healing, MPen is better for mid, while AP is good for support and top.\n\nTaken Luden's first, actually, it gives a movement speed bonus to go with your passive and the pushing ability is REALLY needed.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}
