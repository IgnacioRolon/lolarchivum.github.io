Being called a troll for things like Karma or Morgana mid instead of supp (And they&#039;re intended to function in these roles FYI), while being praised for going Yi/Shyvanna devourer jg or runeglaive ezreal mid and getting the amount of kills expected while it was broken is absolutely unfair.","replies":[{"poster":"Xylke","date":"2015-08-20T20:28:06.576+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I don't really see the problem you get XD I like playing off meta every now and then and everyone's fine with it...

I highly doubt the examples you gave are situation's you have found yourself in. Morgana mid is actually rather common.. Seen a few karma mid's as well.. But imo riot have already got rid of the meta to an extent. Ya know they are trying to push morde bot lane right? Thats gotta be one of the furthest from the meta there can be.","replies":[{"poster":"TeCoolMage","date":"2015-08-17T10:53:50.420+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It hasn't happened to me specifically with Morgana, but people have spammed \"report morgana\" in chat for going mid and not bot in games I play. Karma is also meant to be mid, they're both designed to be used in mid actually. I've had an Ashe spam \"report Karma for not supping\" in one of my _normal_ games.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"DragonOfTheVoid","date":"2015-08-16T21:54:29.925+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I know how you feel I went {{champion:121}}  jg and fed so hard last game and the mid {{champion:112}} also fed cos he picked a meta pick they sed it was ok because he got outplayed but I was just feeding cos I picked a troll champ \n\nin a different game I went 21 2 7 as {{champion:5}}  jg but my team sed I was shit for and I [  ]   [ that your just a troll you did bad ] all because I don't follow the meta \n\nother players flame and if you dare tell your jg that he is a troll dick ass so on because of a champ pick then you beter hope to hell that he cares about winning because if not you just upset someone who can change the game by ks and cs all in your lane in joy all bow to the dark lord                                   {{champion:17}}  {{champion:17}}  {{champion:17}}  {{champion:17}}  {{champion:17}}  {{champion:17}}  {{champion:17}}  {{champion:17}}  {{champion:17}}  {{champion:17}}  {{champion:17}}  {{champion:17}}  {{champion:17}}  {{champion:17}}  {{champion:17}}  {{champion:17}}  {{champion:17}}  {{champion:17}}  {{champion:17}}  {{champion:17}}  {{champion:17}}  {{champion:17}}  {{champion:17}}  {{champion:17}}  {{champion:17}}  {{champion:17}}  {{champion:17}}  {{champion:17}}  {{champion:17}}  {{champion:17}}  {{champion:17}}  {{champion:17}}  {{champion:17}}  {{champion:17}}  {{champion:17}}  {{champion:17}}  {{champion:17}}  {{champion:17}}  {{champion:17}}  {{champion:17}}  {{champion:17}}  {{champion:17}}  {{champion:17}}  {{champion:17}}  {{champion:17}}  {{champion:17}}  {{champion:17}}  {{champion:17}}  {{champion:17}}  {{champion:17}}  {{champion:17}}  {{champion:17}}  {{champion:17}}  {{champion:17}}","replies":[]}]}
