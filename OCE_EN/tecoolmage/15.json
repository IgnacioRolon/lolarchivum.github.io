I like having the jungler keep lane for me while I&#039;m gone, but I&#039;m afraid this might be rude even though I think the gold per second is higher in lane than in camps. So instead, I treat recalling like extremely long roaming, I shove the wave right before the tower tries to kill the minions and race back to lane while the enemy is roaming and ganking.","replies":[{"poster":"TouchMyKimchi","date":"2015-07-06T08:23:38.229+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"wait, did you just say you use Teleport in Mid?\n\noh dear","replies":[{"poster":"TeCoolMage","date":"2015-07-06T12:34:43.165+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yeah.

The extra extra global map pressure is still fun to play with mid game.\n\nI really don't know how to use barrier. It's just hard to time IMO.","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Knuuckles","date":"2015-07-05T04:53:21.943+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Is there a question in there somewhere ?","replies":[{"poster":"TeCoolMage","date":"2015-07-06T12:33:51.008+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yes, the title.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"McRuthless","date":"2015-07-05T13:04:39.589+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"If you kill the enemy minion wave as soon as it arrives, you will have 30-40 seconds to recall and get back to lane before the next wave hits your tower.
