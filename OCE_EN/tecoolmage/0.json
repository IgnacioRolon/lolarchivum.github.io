So I started getting him to play {{champion:7}} , which can go without CS and still carry because she scales off champion kills and assists rather than farm due to her lack of waveclear. Now we&#039;re both really effective at non-meta duo lanes, but LeBlanc is getting a bit boring for him.\n\n\nWhat champs like {{champion:7}} can carry with little CS and usually do so with more ease than other champs? Of course, she needs a BIT, but the first kill should get her in a spree. I'm not looking for supports like Soraka who need 0 CS.","replies":[{"poster":"SEKAI","date":"2015-07-09T02:23:42.447+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"If you're running jungle, then you don't generally have to worry too much about people taking your cs, nor would you need all that much to function properly thanks to jungle buffs and items.\n\nOr if you have to lane you can try play the snowball killing machines like Olaf or Rengar who farm champs instead of minions, but they are the type who don't always come out successful so there's that too.\n\nBut really, generally only supp and tanks can still function quite well when they don't even cs much due to the utility they provide.","replies":[{"poster":"TeCoolMage","date":"2015-07-09T08:18:37.589+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=SEKAI,realm=OCE,application-id=FjGAIbRv,discussion-id=E3t6hWvG,comment-id=0002,timestamp=2015-07-09T02:23:42.447+0000)\n>\n> If you're running jungle, then you don't generally have to worry too much about people taking your cs, nor would you need all that much to function properly thanks to jungle buffs and items.\n> \n> Or if you have to lane you can try play the snowball killing machines like Olaf or Rengar who farm champs instead of minions, but they are the type who don't always come out successful so there's that too.\n> \n> But really, generally only supp and tanks can still function quite well when they don't even cs much due to the utility they provide.\n\nOlaf and Rengar are exactly what I mean; snowballing with champs and having the ability to do so without taking too much CS for a long amount of time. Unfortunately I can't find any ranged or AP ones {{item:3070}} {{item:3070}} other than LB. Maybe I can just tell him to start off with Relic Shield instead.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Crowd Pleasa","date":"2015-07-08T14:36:15.217+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"\"because she scales off champion kills and assists rather than farm\". This sentence make no sense. Kills give you gold, farm gives you gold. The only champions that scale off of kills better than from farming are those who gain extra bonus's from kills (Rengar).

She drops off really badly at midgame if she doesn't get 1 kill before 20 mins.\n\nI'll tell him to take Lee Sin, but doesn't Sion need CS like Nasus except for HP?","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"xFaker","date":"2015-07-09T05:47:55.220+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Gromp/Your Mom","replies":[]},{"poster":"SexP3ke","date":"2015-07-09T05:23:00.206+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"panth jarvan bot","replies":[]},{"poster":"Blackavar","date":"2015-07-09T00:31:48.321+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"tell him to play j4, he is great in duo lanes","replies":[]}]}
