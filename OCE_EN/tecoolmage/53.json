Of course, it should STILL happen, but in general, there shouldn&#039;t be two mid or two junglers, and the system should try to avoid these, but still make these odd pairings if there&#039;s really no choice. Also, add the commonness of how often someone follows their playstyle data, so sympathetic people who want to try out new roles (A support that wants to try a new hero for top lane), can see if the person designated as top ALWAYS goes top, or just does so slightly more often than other roles.\r\n\r\nAt the very least, let us see playstyle data on champion select.\r\n\r\nAlso, they should add pre-game pings, so people in the champion select can pick a lane using the map instead of spamming the chat with things like:\r\nMID\r\nMID\r\nMDI\r\nMIDI\r\nMID\r\n\r\nIn general, this should stop conflicts a bit, but it shouldn&#039;t stagnate the meta with the basic &#039;jungler, support, ADC, mid and top&#039; strategy.","replies":[{"poster":"Yuriklatura","date":"2015-04-15T06:54:56.207+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thats actually a really good idea, but as the most disputed positions (in my experience anyway) are mid and top.
