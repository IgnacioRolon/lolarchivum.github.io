Is it just an item one gets for a bunch of stats when there isn&#039;t a specific need the team has because they aren&#039;t being opposed too hard, but still opposed hard enough to discourage getting a Mejai, or are there specific situations for when I should get one (For sustaining poke-heavy champs, when against tanks, etc?)","replies":[{"poster":"TouchMyKimchi","date":"2015-07-15T06:17:53.585+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"except for a handful of champs it is situational.\n\nDon't make it a 2nd/3rd/4th item, decide to build it first to use catalyst early lane.","replies":[]},{"poster":"SEKAI","date":"2015-07-15T03:36:18.165+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"If you have a champ who is AP, require/emphasis on both HP and mana sustain and something to rush as the early game first item, then get RoA.","replies":[]},{"poster":"BarryButcher","date":"2015-07-14T14:11:59.520+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"**You always want to complete a ROA before 18 mins or so since it takes 10 mins to fully stack up.**\n\nIts usually the first complete item if you are building it.\nChampions like Ryze usually build it after they buy a tear.\n\nThe catalyst is surprisingly good in lane. You will be amazed at how much healing it actually gives you when you level up.\nThe Blasting Ward isn't a bad purchase either if you want more damage if your slightly ahead.\n\n**I usually go Blasting wand first if i think i can get a kill, or catalyst first if im just trying to farm out the early game.**\n\nChampions who normally buy it are those who need mana, tankiness and AP {{champion:31}} {{champion:38}} {{champion:13}} {{champion:57}} {{champion:79}}\n\nHowever others can build it too.
