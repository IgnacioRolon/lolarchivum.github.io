They're always going to exist and no system, automated or manual, will be able to completely remove them from any game (rather, from any community). At times you may notice barely any and at other times you may notice a whole lot more, everyone experiences it. It's likely just one of those times where you're being matched with more people who are inclined to troll and you'll probably start noticing less at some point.","replies":[{"poster":"DragonOfTheVoid","date":"2015-09-02T18:24:08.328+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"well in the game titan fall if you hacked the game to change stuff as you could do it the creators decided that they would put all the hackers together on 1 sever  if riot was to get all trolls smerfs and toxic players all on 1 sever they would leave game its a good system a few games are working on it and I think it would only need to be up for a littlie as lets face it if your a troll and get put in a team were you are all trolls and the enemy are all trolls your not gona have fun no more  same with smerfs and toxic players then me you and all the good players are gona have a good time play more and all the bad players are just gona leve the game and go play cod","replies":[{"poster":"Project Xayah","date":"2015-09-03T00:26:35.370+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Difference is Titanfall is a pay to play game, League of Legends it free to play. It's significantly harder for someone to just make a new account for a pay to play game than a free to play game, for LoL it takes all of 5 minutes (including making a new email account). While such a system would have an effect on **individual accounts** the players themselves would do what they already are and just make a new account. Not to mention, not all \"toxic\" players are even identified by the punishment systems, some of them do slip through (and that's part of what I mean when I say no system will completely remove them). While it's a good idea for a pay to play or subscription game it wouldn't be effective for LoL.","replies":[{"poster":"DragonOfTheVoid","date":"2015-09-03T03:50:17.856+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"yer I suppose your right its a real same maybe I should just go play titan fall lol","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}
