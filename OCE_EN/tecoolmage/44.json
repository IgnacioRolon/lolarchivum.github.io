Sometimes they even miss out on a level's worth of EXP going AFK in the bush\n\nWhenever I gank mid I _always_ enter through one of the four pathways on the sides of the bushes so I enter lane right in front of the enemy tower, eliminating the need for bait and making escape much less likely.\n\nWhy oh WHY do people insist on ganking in those stupid bushes?!","replies":[{"poster":"Klavinmour","date":"2015-07-16T12:57:20.056+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Few things here.\nEntering in front of the tower, will likely get you SHOT by the tower.\n\nAs a jungle main, I want guarantee in my ganks.\nI want to live through them, and make sure that either my laner or myself gets a kill or benefit out of this gank.\nI want to minimise all risk to myself and the laner I am ganking for.\n\nSo what do I look for when I want to gank?\n\n->Are the enemy past the halfway mark and closer to my team's tower\n->My health/mana, team mate's health/mana and the enemy's health/mana\n->Levels of myself, team mates and enemies\n->Vision coverage\n->Items and CS counts\n->Various miscellaneous checks\n\nIf I am to gank, I want 75% positive in my favour out of those checks, ganking mid through bush usually helps light up vision in some dark spots.\nIf 75% of those checks work out, you'll have a good chance that the enemy wont escape and you and your laner will live.\n\nAs for the river bushes being warded, as the Middle Laner it is your job to know if your opponent has warded that bush or not and inform anyone who wants to gank for you.","replies":[{"poster":"TeCoolMage","date":"2015-07-17T12:47:28.227+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Does the tower range really cover that much of the path??? I never have a problem with it because I always hug the edges away from the tower, so I'm not sure.\n\nAs for your checks, what about when you need baiting to knock the chance up to 75%?
