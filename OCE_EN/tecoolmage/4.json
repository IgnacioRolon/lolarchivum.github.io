Right after I won the only game we played against each other ever.\n\nIs he even playing the same game as me? How can people think it's a bad thing to be a team player in a team play, and still expect to win against 5 players?","replies":[{"poster":"Exhausted","date":"2015-07-21T07:36:47.887+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"?.............","replies":[{"poster":"TeCoolMage","date":"2015-07-21T07:50:42.585+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":".............!","replies":[{"poster":"RonyStark","date":"2015-07-22T02:36:33.255+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"¿.............¡","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Revelations 13","date":"2015-07-21T08:46:50.395+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":2,"body":"this isnt a team game, thats why its called SOLO q, the other player are basically AI, getting carried by your team isn't a reliable way to rise.","replies":[{"poster":"flamingsword2","date":"2015-07-21T09:36:26.958+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"League of Legends is a team game. \nRiot has said so much to emphasise the point, yet not much people understand the concept.\nIf the dragon is going up be up soon, make the calls. Tell the team \"Come, drag up soon.\"\n\nYou don't need to carry every game you play, and being a support that is 0/5 doesn't mean you are bad.\nEveryone makes mistakes; tolerate them and tell your teammates how they could improve.\nThis is why many support mains have been able to get to challenger, yet most \"pro players\" are still in bronze.","replies":[{"poster":"RonyStark","date":"2015-07-22T02:35:53.524+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"was having bad play at bot lane 2 days ago.

When you learn the goal of the game is not to carry yourself, leave everyone else behind, and get 1v5d, but instead to be light enough to be carried while still being strong enough for the team effort and sometimes still lose the 5v5 and have fun at the game, then you've already got more than what any challenger tier can ask for.\n\nFun is OP, winning is UP.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Garens Harem","date":"2015-07-21T09:39:43.266+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"any one under d5 75lp is bad in my standards","replies":[]}]}
