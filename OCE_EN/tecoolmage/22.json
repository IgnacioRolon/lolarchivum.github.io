Pick an uncommonly used method of expressing anger or cruelty.\n2. Use that method to express a _compliment_\n3. Collect results and responses\n4. Repeat step 1 - 3 to get a good amount of samples.\n5. Determine common methods of expressing anger or cruelty\n\nThis is what I ended up with\n1. I picked using ALL CAPS AND AN EMOTE >:( in a rage-like manner to express anger\n2. My first attempt went like this:\n\n> \"OMG NIDALEE, YOURE TOO GOOD AT THIS, I THINK YOU MIGHT SECRETLY BE A CHALLENGER WHO CAN 1v5 US ALL!!!!! YOU MAKE ME LOOK LIKE A NOOB T-T\"\n\n3.The result was this:\n\n> Nid: \"lol no, this is my main.\"\n> Vi: \"omfg stop being such a p-ssy and accept f---ing defeat, you motherf---ing 9 y.o\"\n\n(Asterisks are terrible for formatting...)\n\n4.I repeated the process and got 5 results. I was careful and did not use swear words, racism, sexism, or inappropriate undertones\n5.All of them featured at least two swear words in one sentence, none of them actually being related to my statement. Not all of them were from the person I complimented, some simply saw the capital letters and responded angrily.\n\nConclusion:\nThe LoL community has a large number of people who simply think it&#039;s o.k to say these words without any meaning, using it as emphasis rather than personal derogatory attacks.\n\nOf course, this is based off 5 results and in normal mode. Someone else should test with ranked and possible co op, with different divisions and ELO rankings.\n\nEdit: oh wow the formatting is terrible when it comes to lists.","replies":[{"poster":"Chicken4dinner","date":"2015-06-30T15:54:13.365+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"1. Your premises is wrong \n2. the voting options are terrible \n3. IM USING BIG WORDS SO I MUST BE ABUSING YOU\n(ahem) bullshit \n4. Overall you don't know how to conduct a social experiment...\n\n\nHarsh words and even more uncalled for, but in a way you need to hear that you haven't just struck gold with this. It is a good cause no doubt but the nature of the game is \"balance of power\" so allow me to delve deeper into this subject and why it applies to players who are toxic...\n\nWhen two animals of the same species interact, they size each other up. the bigger male assumes dominance over the smaller ones and others will constantly compete for that position of alpha male. We humans often behave in a simular manner although usually it is in a more civilized way... this does not negate the fact that we still do it to the same extremities as any animal however we are socially aware and therefore it does not become overtly aggressive behaviour. \n\nLeague gives us immunity to one of these barriers that stops us from becoming dominant to an extent that is socially unacceptable, and that is because of it's anonymity. When someone attempts to assume dominance and the reverse happens it is humiliating (the natural emotional response), this mounts tension and frustration. Of course this accumulates until they try to verbally undermine others to make up for their lack of security in themselves crumbled by hours of accumulated egotistical frustrations and tenuous belief in themselves.\n\nBy verbally attacking others they are attempting to dominate them yet they know they never really will until they play well enough that no one can stand before them... in which case they will simply vent further. \n\nThe reason people are toxic is because of the apex pyramid mentality present in all males and how some people feel like worthless shit when the realize they are not all they made themselves out to be.","replies":[{"poster":"TeCoolMage","date":"2015-07-01T07:46:31.146+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'm mostly joking, even the experiment itself was a joke, but I tried it anyways for laughs and got surprising results so I decided to share.
