The opposite applies if you&#039;re losing badly, which is a very un-default-y state to be in. Exceptions do exist, but most of them apply to the ADC and jungle. The jungler should ward his own jungle with greens and the enemy's with a pink, while the ADC should prioritize the wards closest to her lane and leave the rest to her support.\n\nI didn&#039;t include 3 green wards each for some of the roles, I strongly discourage ever having less than 3 wards on the map, but they can be anywhere you feel like you&#039;d need it, this guide is only for warding minimally (it only includes the required parts, not the extra situational ones, which are all directly in the lanes and not the jungle).\n\nFeedback OP, pls gif.\n\nEDIT: The green wards map is a larger file than the pink one for some reason, and now I've finally gotten it in after a few odd resizing issues\n\nEDIT: Other tips:\n\nIf you feel the enemy alkali or twitch is really annoying you with stealth and you want to save your pink wards, get the jungler to place yours for you in a premade. Place a green instead in solo queue.\n\nI didn't include a lot of information for the ADC, but it's best you ward based on how many towers have been destroyed, while the support goes for the dragon pit, tribush, and other more required places.\n\nMid should stop warding towards the river after at least one or two towers have been destroyed. Instead, ward based on which towers are destroyed. Warding based on tower destruction is much more important as ganking mid is easy compared to top and bottom.\n\nWhen roaming, if your allies aren't warding the lane you want to gank, do it yourself.","replies":[{"poster":"McRuthless","date":"2015-07-18T22:28:31.735+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Only criticism i have is the pink wards on dragon/baron are better placed in the entrance in front of the monster so they can actually see wards outside the pit (enemy wards placed at #7 or #14 would see you taking it but are out of range of your pink).","replies":[{"poster":"TeCoolMage","date":"2015-07-19T02:02:55.463+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Do you mean the anti-Evelynn wards (#10 and #9)? Because those are actually a trick that messes with her stealth mechanics. If you place a pink ward as close to the tribush as possible in the dragon or baron pit, and a green in the tribush, her stealth gets revealed as she sneaks into lane, without her seeing the pink ward. I don't recommend placing pinks outside of bushes simply to find wards, just use the cheaper red trinket instead.","replies":[{"poster":"McRuthless","date":"2015-07-19T06:01:10.080+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Oh yea i didnt see the little annotations. I guess the baron side one could be kinda useful, the one in dragon pit would get found pretty quickly though, and they're much harder to defend than just having it in the tribrush or river.","replies":[{"poster":"TeCoolMage","date":"2015-07-19T15:33:29.364+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'm not even sure if Evelynn can gank bottom lane that well anyway, she lacks hard CC for the mobile ADCs and probably does better in 1v1... So I wouldn't worry about warding dragon pit at all.\n\nI'd never put my pink in the tribush. If Evelynn sees your pink while she's taking dragon, good for her. If she sees your pink while she's ganking, you better run because she knows you're prepared and will be much more careful and alert.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}
