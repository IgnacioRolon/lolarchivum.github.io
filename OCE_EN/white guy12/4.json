This is very deceptive, especially when you upgrade your yellow trinket to a Greater Stealth Totem. As this makes it look like you always have a charge up. \r\n_**The Mute Bug**_\r\nSo I just encountered this in a game I played, When I muted a person it said &quot;User is now being ignored.&quot; And my chat disappeared, It also bugs sometimes when you mute someone and it says &quot;User has been unmuted.&quot; when really they should be muted.\r\n**Some notable mentions**\r\nThese aren&#039;t entirely bugs, but they can be a nuisance.\r\n-When playing Elise, it seems that the smart move system doesn&#039;t know whether to walk to the wall and Venomous Bite over it or walk around and use it. Although this doesnt happen all the time, It can cause you to get stuck in the wall while the smart move system decides which route is quicker.\r\nAlthough this was a short forum post, I hope it was a helpful one in pointing out some of the bugs/nuisances in this patch.","replies":[{"poster":"Alamo","date":"2015-06-26T08:59:35.676+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"short???
