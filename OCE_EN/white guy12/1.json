Do you get stacks too quickly? Are the battle stats too good?\n\nPlenty of things Riot can think of, but they simply don't know how exactly the item will be exploited.\nI mean, they nerfed Xins healing and everyone was thinking... wtf why? Sated + AP Xin meant he would never die.\n\nI think everyone has learnt, don't fight a Devourer jungler 1v1 unless you have CC and Ban Shyvanna.\nYou can handle Yi with a bit of CC as long as your team doesn't immediately /ff once he gets his first triple kill.","replies":[{"poster":"white guy12","date":"2015-07-15T12:49:31.652+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Erm.. Well just looking at the tool tip it already shows what needs to be nerfed..\n60 Magic damage on hit!?!? You now need to build a moderate amount MR against a 3 AD (JG, TOP, ADC) and 1 AP (Mid) just so you can reduce the magic damage taken, more than what would be required against a non devourer JG. This not only delays power spikes and/or teamfighting but also increases the amount of gold needed for defences on a carry class.\nOn hit effects are applied twice now?! You obviously don't know how much 90 true damage from a Yi can hurt. This 90 true damage (assuming max build gives 300 ad+) paired with the on hit magic damage and if you decide to buy it, a wits end, can ultimately ruin a team. Thats roughly 492 damage a hit before defences and the Wits end MR shred. Imagine how an AD carry would feel, even an AP carry. They would have to substitute 2 items for defence. One item for the AD, and another for the AP damage. This almost ruins the whole idea of an AD Carry. \nAnd about the CC part. Wasting a stun on a champ just because of 1 ITEM isn't worth it at all in terms of teamfighting e.g you waste 3 second stun on a Yi and you have to kill the APC and ADC now with less CC abilities, This ultimately buffs ADC's like Sivir, Lucian and Graves where you have the kit to absorb or dodge skillshots. You might aswell take your chances in kill the other 4 members and attempting to kill the devourer jungle with what you have left.\nTL;DR Huge item stats and huge damage passive is really unnecessary, Mobility ADCs and Sivir get an indirect buff.","replies":[{"poster":"Project Xayah","date":"2015-07-15T12:54:32.212+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"> you waste 3 second stun on a Yi\n\nImplying you wouldn't need to \"waste\" hard CC on a fed Yi anyway...","replies":[{"poster":"white guy12","date":"2015-07-15T13:01:46.080+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Implying that wasting 3 seconds on a Yi instead of an ADC or APC whom now get free damage during TFs is worth it.","replies":[{"poster":"Project Xayah","date":"2015-07-16T02:10:49.257+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Well, that's the choice you need to make, isn't it? \"Waste\" the cc on Yi or \"waste\" it on one of the ADCs/APCs.","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Daejel","date":"2015-07-15T23:18:52.463+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"If you think Shyvana is Op with it, wait until you try Jax.
