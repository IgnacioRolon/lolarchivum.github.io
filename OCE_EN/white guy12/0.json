I just lost a game we would've won. and, it was a really good game we would've won. But my team thought it'd be best to surrender. It ended like this. I accidentally turned my modem off, I'm getting frustrated because it takes 5 years to load back up. After 5 minutes its up, its running. Now I just gotta wait 4 minutes for the patcher to load up. After all this is done I get back into the game. Our base is being pushed, all inhibs down and they're attacking the nexus turrets. I come and kill 4 of them, their ADC gets away. I get rid of the creeps in base and then buy my GA and an elixir. As long as Leona is alive then I can kill all 5 of them. Once the enemy team is all up they start baron, our Quinn and Elise are running to their imminent doom. Elise tries to steal baron by rappelling up and down, it fails. She has to flash in. She mis-smites it. She is dead. Our heroic Quinn charges into battle, steaming with vengeance. She wants some kills, before I know it shes dead. 0 kills for us, 2 for them. Its me and Leona left. Our team puts up a surrender vote. I say no, I know that I can kill all 5 with Leona. A yes from another team mate. One more yes and that's game... the final yes comes through. I go into an enraged fit, Screaming at my computer. Typing as fast as I could asking why, why did you surrender?... They had baron was the answer. Apparently my corki 2 shot carry abilities were too little for a baron buff. I'm now pissed off. I just went 31-8 for nothing. I'm thinking to myself,  Had they not seen me 1v4 earlier? We would've won, I just needed Leona to apply her passive debuff to all of them and it was an easy penta for me. But... its too late. After that game I cuss at my team. The more I think about it the more angry I get. After 10 minutes I decide to make this post. The end. \r\nEven though It was my fault that we lost in a way. (because I dced), I am angry at them for surrendering.","replies":[{"poster":"Indy Savvy","date":"2015-01-19T07:08:07.853+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I really like your writing, so emotive and descriptive. I couldn't stop reading until the end, I think you have potential to be a columnist with a little grammatical editing. As for your game bad luck, try to be zen and look at what you learn from that game, apply it to future games. A better router and computer would also help.","replies":[]},{"poster":"WEETBIX 4 BREKKI","date":"2015-01-19T06:31:50.986+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"owell, everyone has bad games, move on","replies":[]},{"poster":"RNG Remilia","date":"2015-01-19T06:00:14.355+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"TL:DR\n\n> [{quoted}](name=Buddar,realm=OCE,application-id=Ntey9fRZ,discussion-id=E4eE8Iuk,comment-id=,timestamp=2015-01-19T05:32:12.193+0000)\n>\n>  I am angry at them for surrendering.","replies":[]},{"poster":"SEKAI","date":"2015-01-19T05:58:35.558+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Paragraphs help tbh.\n\nI have seen teams, both enemy and ally, who surrender even when not losing. Just like \"ah we had a bad trade gg surrender\", and everyone just votes yes for no apparent reason, like the total kill difference isn't even over 5 Come On.\n\nBut oh well, learn to let go and move on.
