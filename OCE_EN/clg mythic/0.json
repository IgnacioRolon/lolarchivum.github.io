I ended up in bronze III 0LP at the end of season 4. However climbed to silver III with an  MMR of around 1400 during preseason (current time).  Will my provisonals go off my season 4 end MMR of around  1100 or my new MMR of 1400(during preseason)? Please help me. I cant sleep at night not knowing if i will be placed in bronze next season.","replies":[{"poster":"Goldendo 2","date":"2014-12-05T17:32:28.738+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Itll go off the mmr u finish with in preseason.

Really depends if you win/lose those first few placements which are worth more MMR.\n\nAlso if you could get B3 -> S3 in a 3 week period, why would you be worried about getting bronze again?\nYou'd be getting B1 if you did (slight chance of B2), so it wouldn't be difficult to play out of considering your track record.","replies":[{"poster":"Goldendo 2","date":"2014-12-06T06:46:19.871+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> Really depends if you win/lose those first few placements which are worth more MMR.\n\n\nWhat. none of the 10 placement matches are worth more mmr. You get placed higher if u are on a win streak. The win streak makes your mmr go up/ double etc\n\nRanked reset is basically the same as a fresh account unranked games other than you have played ranked on the account and will be reset to a elo accordingly.","replies":[]}]}]}
