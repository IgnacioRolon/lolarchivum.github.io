There isn't a booster in every game because there aren't enough people that can actually boost, especially on OCE. I'm not saying that no one is being boosted, but everything said about it has been hyperbolized. This, and I quote, \"I had 3 boosters in my one game today!\" is a farce and the person is just mad he got outplayed. Someone being bronze and going 18/2 is not unheard of. Most bronze people are actually great players with kills, but not objectives, hence why they lose. They get all the kills and cannot scale with it as their team is starved and they lack the ability to carry off that.\n\nI don't check profiles if I get stomped. People should stop doing this. Download the replay and watch the person that hammered you and learn how they played and then use that for the future. If the person was boosted, they will be back into bronze or silver in no time, regardless.\n\nI think the issue of boosting and it hitting peak times around this time is because of the skin. Someone offered me $1,700 for my account with Victorious Jarven and Victorious Janna. Riot is underestimating the demand and desire for these skins that people's moral code seems to vanish. People who hate boosters will turn to boosters if they want the skin.\n\nI'm an Annie main, maybe Veigar at times, and if I couldn't hit gold, I'd buy a boost if she got a Victorious skin.\n\nRiot knows who is getting boosted. Don't underestimate them. They know who was boosted. All it would take is a few minutes of searching and most boosted accounts would be banned. Most boosters do not change their IP. An IP going onto other accounts for x periods of time is suspicious. Riot won't do anything, though. I have seen people boosted from bronze 5 to challenger and not been banned.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Lord Sesshomaru","date":"2017-08-17T09:49:11.804+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"#My Philosophy\n\nUsually, as many members of the boards know:\nWith many forms of player behaviour, I believe that most _(if not all)_ of the blame rests with the player alone, and that the player should be fully accountable for their own behaviour.\n\nToxic players are toxic not because of any flaws in the system, but because of choices they make.  I believe that scripting is not the fault of anyone else, but the offender.  and that Smurfs are created mainly to satisfy the individual player's need for self gratification and the inability to accept that they are anything other that the 'god' they are in their head. \n\nAll of that is their own fault, and no one else's, least of all Riot's.\n\nHowever when it comes to boosting, I personally believe Riot is not completely devoid of blame. My beef here lies with the Victorious skin line.\n\n__________\n\n\n#The Victorious \n\nThe annual Victorious skin is created based on the success a certain champion has during the season. The champion, due to their success, is highly picked in widely viewed and appraised pro play.  Videos such as pocket picks, and other e-sports interviews mention and showcase that champion _(among others)_.\nAnd e-sports commentators and Youtubers go wild when said champion makes plays.\nSo due to the near-religious enthralment and dedication many players have with the competitive scene, players start playing the champion, and quite a lot of players find them quite fun and so continue playing them, perhaps even becoming mains.\n\nSo Riot has inadvertently hyped up this champion _(among others of course)_, increasing the champion's player base and following, _(and a vast majority of the player base is low elo.)_ Not to mention all the players that already were playing this champ!\n\nThen at the end of the season Riot dangles a new limited edition one-time only prestigious skin for the champion, and says: \n**\"look at what 67.16% of you will never have!\"**\n\n_________\n\n#Human Nature\n\nHow can you expect people, in their desperation for a one-time only skin for the champ they've been maining for a year now, to not turn to boosting?\n\nIt's like purposely starving a dog, then slapping a juicy steak a few meters in front of it and telling it to sit and stay, just so you can punish the poor mutt when it leaps at the steak.\n\nIt is within Riot's power to change the Victorious skins, to make them not limited edition, make them available for purchase from the store once a year _(but only for golds and above.)_. That way, players believe they still have a chance to work their way up and earn the skin, without having to resort to desperate measures when Riot announces the skin a mere few weeks before the end of the season. If they don't get gold this season, they can still earn the skin next season by working hard. Theres no need to resort to cheating.\n\nIt's still a reward, you still have to get gold, but now it's without the pressure of having to get gold this specific year. Rather than suddenly realising that if they don't get gold in the next few weeks, they'll lose out on a skin for one of their favourite champions, _forever_.\n\nWhat other option is there?\n\n\n___________\n\n#Morals\n\n**I disagree with boosting**! \nI think it's unfair and shitty to players who are trying to work their way up lawfully.  And if I have a booster in my game ill be angry and unimpressed!\n\nBut as long as the Victorious skins remain in the game in their current form, I cannot, and will not, judge players for having their accounts boosted, nor would I expect them to be punished.\n\nI wouldn't kick a starving dog for stealing a steak, so likewise taking that logic, I could not agree to ban a desperate Bronze player for wanting his one chance at a Victorious skin.\nCould you?\n\nHow would you feel?\nThink about players like:\n\nHeartVine with Xayah or Quinn\n\nDeep Terror Nami with Nami\n\nI Stealth I with Talon.\n\nMyself with Azir, Aurelion Sol, or Taliyah.\n\nTalon12 with Yasuo.\n\nWe all have champs we love to pieces, and even have reputations for loving, think about your own main, could you honestly say that when faced with the possibility of losing the chance for an awesome skin for them, forever, unless you climb whole divisions in the next few weeks. That you wouldn't feel even slightly trapped?\n\nIm not saying that myself of any of the mentioned players would or should resort to boosting! But using the love they have for their champions as an example, you can easily see how some players out there might.\n\nIm not saying it's right to boost, but it is an unfair and crushing cycle.\n\n\n_____________\n\n_____________\n\n#TL;DR:\n\nI think boosting is really shitty behaviour, it's unfair and immoral. And I could never condone it. But as long as Riot dangles one-time only limited shit like the Victorious skins in front of desperate players _(the majority of whom will never be able to obtain it otherwise)_, I personally cannot judge players for doing it _(if that is the reason they are doing it of course)_.\n\nBut ultimately, it is wrong.\nAnd for the sake of the health of queues, there should be punishment.","replies":[{"poster":"Klavinmour","date":"2017-08-17T23:20:09.854+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"*shudders* the most likely champ for Victorious this year is Ivern...\nMuch rather see him deleted.","replies":[{"poster":"Lord Sesshomaru","date":"2017-08-18T21:16:03.371+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You really hate him aye xD\nfair enough! \nAlthough the last Victorious skin was for an AP jungler, (Maokai) so you might be safe there :P\n\nGenuinely, all I hope for is that it isn't Azir, Sol or Taliyah! \nIf it isn't them, I don't care who it's for.

Such players are the bane of any gamers existence and simply ruin the experience for those who are working hard for their place. Personally, I rarely touch ranked (have only ever played as many as 10 ranked games in a season, for SR), so I don't think I have any personal experience with boosters. However, from what I've read, heard and seen about other player's experience, it seems that boosting is more prominent now than it used to be, especially on OCE.\n\nThe bottom line is that the punishment systems have one major flaw, and that's that they are dependant on player feedback (and it's not as if that can be changed by any easy means). If those systems are not receiving the reports to lead them to the troublesome players, there's not much reason to believe they'll be effective. In my opinion, it's always worth it to spend a few seconds reporting anyone you think of anything serious, such as boosting/cheating. At least then, it falls squarely under Riot's responsibility and you can feel free to take it up with them if you believe nothing is being done.","replies":[]}]}
