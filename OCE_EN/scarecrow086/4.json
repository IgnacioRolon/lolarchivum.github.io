I really like Knight's Vow, even more than Redemption. It might not be as strong as Locket, but I still feel like it helps me protect my carry, and that healing it gives based off your bound ally's attacks has saved me from Ignite damage at least a few times. That being said though, I'd love to try out the new Zeke's sometime on Rakan or Leona, but I haven't really played either one often enough lately to get the chance.","replies":[]}]}
