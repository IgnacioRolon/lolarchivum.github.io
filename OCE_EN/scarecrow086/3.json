The issue is the Jungle Tanks have to be good at ganking and clearing fast and moving around the map, and need to be gold efficient early on.\n\nUnless you can wall drift like a god (takes a bit of practice but not too bad once you get the hang of it), then Sion is bad at ganking and he's got a slow clear speed. Nautilus is also bad at ganking, has a slow clear and takes too long to get around the map. \n\nEarlygame is very important in the meta right now and surprisingly alot of tank junglers are exceptional early duelists, and I think it'd be more accurate to say we're in an early-midgame tank meta. \n\nTanks that take too long to scale just don't have the same impact, hence why Malphite, Naut, Sion and Shen don't fare too well on average.\n\nSo yeah some jungle tanks are meta, but don't just assume that every tank is a good jungler.","replies":[]}]}
