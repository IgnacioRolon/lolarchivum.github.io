The latter tend to be AP mages, that's not to say all AP mages. I think tankier champs are currently topping actual supporting; They get in there, take a lot of aggro, provide utility, and keep their marksman alive just like you'd expect, but they are far less likely to end up with the kill while doing so. The worst is these mage 'supports' like Brand or Malz who come in and build straight damage, no 'nonsense' like a sight stone, bring ignite, and take the kills easily (not even on purpose often) with their high burst leaving the marksman to play second fiddle to them.\n\nI mean okay it gives the team another strong AP champ and your marksman isn't doing as bad as if they were dying in the fights, but I feel like it's unhealthy meta when these 'support' AP mages can rival mid-lane AP mages without farming at all, just by sitting in bot lane poking around waiting to cast a nasty combo. A tough challenge for Riot to be sure in balancing it, but being underpowered a bit more reliably and having to make use of the utility aspects of a champ was more a forte of supports in the past than it seems to be these days, and as a result there was less.. cheese in the bot lane, if I might put it that way.\n\nSo in short, AP mage supports are doing strong in the bot lane, but not particularly because they are doing a lot of 'supporting'. Of course with plenty of exceptions; Soraka, Bard, Lulu, Janna, etc are strong mage supports in their own right that tend not to get carried away with the kills.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Arkangyle","date":"2017-07-20T09:28:28.938+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Meta is definitely tanky at the moment. In the OPL last week there were only two support picks that weren't tanky - Destiny took Zyra and Cupcake played Bard. \n\nThresh, Braum and Rakan seem to be getting a fair bit of priority at the moment. Ali starting to come back into it too. They're tanky supports with good CC and decent engage, and teams seem to be prioritising that style of champ.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Fruitsalad","date":"2017-07-20T08:05:07.930+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Supports can carry games.\n\nEvery time i get a good one i will generally kiss their feet with praise. \n\nits the most underrated role in OCE and the people who master it are 9/10 the nicest people you will meet.\n\n\ni think there is quite abit of variety atm in the botlane support side.
