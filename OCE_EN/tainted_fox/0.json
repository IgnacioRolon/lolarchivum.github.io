Sword of the occult and mejai's in Bot games wrecks the game for anyone who isnt using it and for the new player experience. it changes the meta in the game to the point one person carries and ends the game, leaving you with just laning and not engaging with the game or the team\r\n\r\nremove these items in bot games, its stupid and doesn't encourage teamwork","replies":[{"poster":"Tainted fox","date":"2015-02-19T04:33:36.311+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"but the point of a bot game isn't to finish it as fast as you can to get easy IP. not everyone shares the same personal objective. some people want to experiment elements of late game but that never happens cause stacking items\n\nwhich means i would have to try it in a normals and get flamed or reported if it doesn't work","replies":[{"poster":"Ing√©nue","date":"2015-02-19T11:15:48.619+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Or play a custom game where there is plenty of CS and time....","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Raxistaicho","date":"2015-05-14T23:02:44.321+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"It irritates me when I see super tryhards getting those two items.

Bot games are either a way for fast wins or they're something you can play once or twice when you first start just to learn how the map works. They're never meant to be \"serious\" games.
