I just had a jg match with a friend I just made and we seem to always run into each othere because the map is based on lanes too much # Summoners Rift, and because the lanes are so big there leaves little room for the jungler, and after a while of jungling it starts to become boring because you always have to fight the same monsters in the same routine in the same part of the map, and for weak early game junglers such as kindred, warkick ect; it is really risky having to go into the enemies jg and get camps, so you will pretty much just feed the enemy jgler. So I think that you should make a map based intirely around jungling, and maybe spice it up a bit too by putting in different camps with different buffs, there shouldn&#039;t be anylanes and the fountains should be placed horizontaly from each other so there is no disadvantiges( because lets face it, no one like playing on the top half of the screen). So yeah... I&#039;m not complaining or anything but I (and many others)  would really enjoy it if you put in a jungling map, because you already have one with one big lane # Howling Abyss so why not put one in for people who enjoy jungling ?
