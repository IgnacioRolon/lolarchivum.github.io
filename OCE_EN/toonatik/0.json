How is twice in two months habitual?? ok so i just dealt with it.... until tonight. I have just played 3 games in a row. the first two were losses due to other player connections and a couple rage monkeys, the 3rd game was going good until i lost connection. im assuming my ISP is retarded, my whole internet went down for 30mins. but when i went to play another game i discovered i now have the third tier of low priority, 5 games of 20min waiting times. THIS IS TOTALLY UNFAIR. i really dont deserve this and i never leave games even when people are feeding or being  horrible. it&#039;s like im treated like a guilty criminal but it&#039;s totally undeserved....\r\n\r\nRiot has all the tools it needs to have an effective leaver busters system, it&#039;s 2015 for f*ks sake. they say their servers are unaware whether the player has left due to connection issues or rage quitting. THAT&#039;S COMPLETE B*LLSH*T. if you rage quit you have to go through a series of clicks to exit the game. click 1: hit leave game click 2: click yes i want to leave. THAT IS HOW YOU DETERMINE SOMEONE HAS RAGE QUIT &quot;OH BUT&quot; you say &quot; what about afkers who dont log out but just afk? well is it that hard to develop an algorithym which detects intermittent connection loss? afkers are easy to detect they do nothing for ages without loging off. connection problems are easy to detect, sporadic and unsustained laggs and dc&#039;s. im sure you have the ability to log connection info and refer to it using said algorithym... \r\n\r\nin any case i read that trying to remove the leaver buster penalty is uselss cos riot wont listen to you. but im voicing my opinion here and hope you guys agree that it&#039;s broken and it&#039;s effect is ruining games for people like me.","replies":[{"poster":"HORSE OF FORCE","date":"2015-05-16T01:07:53.210+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":">connection problems are easy to detect, sporadic and unsustained laggs and dc's. im sure you have the ability to log connection info and refer to it using said algorithym... \n\nBut then people will develop ways to abuse this, by say jiggling their internet tubes before leaving the game.\n\nThe reason we have Leaverbuster is because we don't have the Tribunal anymore. Until it's back, it's all automated.\n\nWhat ISP are you with?","replies":[{"poster":"Toonatik","date":"2015-05-16T02:49:33.173+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I dont think the majority of people are going to get up from their desk and go 'jiggle' their router cables before afking. Plus i really think that there are a huge amount of people who genuinely play fair but have connections issues from time to time. they should not be penalized, especially with such harsh implications such as a 20minute wait. that's just plain insulting and i've put a decent bit of cash into this game. it's not deserved. i would rather have people afk in my game due to rage quits than have myself and others unfairly punished in this way.\ncome on...","replies":[{"poster":"HORSE OF FORCE","date":"2015-05-16T03:00:45.712+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Ok, yes, my example was bad. But people most definitely would develop techniques/programs that would allow them to leave games and not get punished for it if the system allowed for people to not get punished for disconnections out of their control.\n\nThe whole thing about people who disconnect from connection issues is that they shouldn't get punished by this system. Riot do not expect everyone to have a perfect connection, nor do they believe that all ISPs play nice with their servers. If you have a disconnection due to this reason, you won't get punished for it. They only reason you might get it is because you've either repeatedly and purposefully left games in the past or you haven't fixed the problem after it happened a few times to you.\n\n>i've put a decent bit of cash into this game.\n\nAnd that was entirely on your own tuition. No amount of money is required to enjoy this game to its fullest. Money will only give you access to aesthetic options.\n\nThe system, of course, could be improved. Drastically, I might say. Automated punishment really sucks. But the way it currently is, it greatly reduces the amount of damage that actual leavers can do to the game.","replies":[{"poster":"Toonatik","date":"2015-05-16T03:37:14.799+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"no cmon, are you assuming that everyone who plays LoL is smart enough to develop programs and tricky ways to circumvent a good leaver buster algorithym? people arnt that smart. and if they are, they will be in a vast minority of players. \n\nexplain please, in my case, why i deserve to be punished from this system? two months ago i played two gamses in which i dc'd a lot, since then i've had clean games. then in one week i get two more penalties from literally two games of connection problems???? what ever system they have now its broken. you have to see that. \n\nalso my allusion to my cash input to this game is only to point out that riot is not poor. in fact they are far from it, able to host major championship comps every season. i run events for a living i know the kind of cash it takes to host those things. \n\ni would also point out the obvious gripe that OCE still has no tribunal.. why in hell would you maintain a server which isn't as functional as the others, are we low priority? i think im begining to prefer playing with 200ping and have a good established server than come here.","replies":[{"poster":"HORSE OF FORCE","date":"2015-05-16T11:46:49.317+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":">no cmon, are you assuming that everyone who plays LoL is smart enough to develop programs and tricky ways to circumvent a good leaver buster algorithym?\n\nNot everyone, but people who are determined to ruin the experience of other players. Some people actually want Leaverbuster to permanently ban people instead of just giving them longer queue times.\n\n>a vast minority of players. \n\nOnly one rotten egg spoils the dozen. The actions of one toxic player will affect the nine other players in that game. It's a lot more noticeable than a good deed.\n\n>explain please, in my case, why i deserve to be punished from this system?\n\nYou don't deserve to be punished. You were given the penalty because the system is not full-proof. Which brings us back to your original point of improving the system, but then that leads us back to this point here (it can be exploited).\n\nA possible explanation for you in particular getting the punishment is that the system probably doesn't account for time elapsed between matches, only how *many* games ago you apparently 'left'. It would look up your record, see that you've been leaving a few games, and doll out the penalty.\n\n>riot is not poor\n\nSolid point. Sorry for mistaking that. Usually people are like, \"I paid money for this so I want proper customer service!\" Sorry for presuming that on you.\n\n>i would also point out the obvious gripe that OCE still has no tribunal.\n\nAnd that is exactly what I want.\n\n>why in hell would you maintain a server which isn't as functional as the others, are we low priority?\n\nTribunal was disabled globally. Or do you mean that the general quality (not related to player behaviour) is better on NA? Because on that part it is. They have Dominion, dammit.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]}
