{"poster":"Sw4g3ttiYoL0n4yz","date":"2016-03-19T07:31:47.627+0000","title":"Basic Draft for Normals @rito pls","subforum":"Miscellaneous","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Normals need a basic draft system, where you select roles you would be comfortable for (any roles from all to only one) and then you are just placed into that role. No ban phase or pick staggering or anything like that, just a guarantee that you will get a role that you want, and if you want to select only one role for an increased queue time, that is your choice.\r\n\r\nNormals need this because it is currently just a matter of who can type and/or lock their role/champion first. It causes fights often if someone calls and another locks, and part of the reason for going into normals is to practice or to try things you don&#039;t normally do, it&#039;s frustrating to be shoe-horned into something that won&#039;t be fun for you just because you don&#039;t want to argue with your team about who will play what.\r\n\r\nA basic draft system would alleviate some of this pressure without creating a longer champion selection process. It also wouldn&#039;t increase queue times for people comfortable to play any role, as setting your option to fill would just slot you into any game going in your MMR range. In the same way Team Builder used to function, you could also have a note to players telling them their estimated wait (for example if many players were choosing the same roles, their wait time would be substantially higher than those more flexible).\r\n\r\nI think players and Riot want the same things for the most part. A streamlined experience, minimal delays and disruptions to play, fun and free from unnecessary conflict.  Normals aren&#039;t supposed to be stressful, it&#039;s supposed to be a casual environment free from a lot of the pressure of ranked games. The current model of normal champion selection adds pressure to players before the game has even started, and I think a reasonably simple change to the way we queue for normals could alleviate that.\r\n\r\n@Riot, from a technical perspective, is this something that could be achieved? And if so, do you think there is any merit in the idea?\r\n{{summoner:4}} {{summoner:4}} {{summoner:4}} {{summoner:4}} {{summoner:4}} {{summoner:4}} {{summoner:4}} {{summoner:4}} {{summoner:4}} {{summoner:4}} {{summoner:4}} {{summoner:4}} {{summoner:4}} {{summoner:4{{summoner:4}} {{summoner:4}} {{summoner:4}} {{summoner:4}} {{summoner:4}} {{summoner:4}} {{summoner:4}} {{summoner:4}} {{summoner:4}}  {{summoner:4}} {{summoner:4}} {{summoner:4}} {{summoner:4}} {{summoner:4}}","replies":[{"poster":"Sw4g3ttiYoL0n4yz","date":"2016-03-21T05:46:04.488+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"rito pls","replies":[]},{"poster":"Ingénue","date":"2016-03-19T08:20:38.559+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Normal draft pick have the NCS on the other severs.
