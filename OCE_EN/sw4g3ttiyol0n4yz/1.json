It's not fun to be on the winning or losing side of an imbalanced game, but what the hell are we supposed to do about it?\r\n\r\nWithout a Tribunal, it really feels like reports fall on deaf ears. We don't get to see any feedback about the player who just ruined our gaming experience, and if it wasn't so re-occurring it wouldn't be so bad. I get that things happen and people leave or they DC, but the consistency that it happens on this server is something I have never experienced in years of the game.\r\n\r\nI purely don't understand how people can afford to be so blas√© about leaving a game. Forget the Summoner's Code, or respect for other human beings, or for the game, fact of the matter is that if you want people to stop leaving games or joining games they can't commit to then you need to provide an incentive for them to stay, or a dis-incentive for them to leave. One that is actually measurable and matters. \"If you leave 2 ranked games in the space of 10 games you will receive a 2 week ban\". That's pretty clear. I bet it would make people think twice before joining a ranked game after they just DC'd from the last one. Or from rage quitting.\r\n\r\nIt honestly does feel like reports fall on deaf ears. I think many people leave the lobby because they're just so sick of it without even bothering to report the player who just ruined the game for everyone else. I have a nice PC and nice internet and half the time I get into post-match most of the people have left, there's no way they took the time to report the player. We also need some sort of indication that our reports are actually doing something. Without Tribunal and without any notification that players that we have reported have been investigated, it's a click of a button that doesn't fix your problem or make you feel better or give you hope for the next game.\r\n\r\nIt isn't really that much to ask to have a decent game with everyone in it from the first 20 seconds. It just doesn't happen that often. {{item:3073}}","replies":[{"poster":"Zaps","date":"2015-03-06T05:50:20.893+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hi Malefic Aku,\n\nThere is currently a system running on Oceania called LeaverBuster. There's [a detailed page on our support knowledgebase here, that contains lots of the details about how this system works](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752714-LeaverBuster-FAQ). \n\nBasically, if someone is repeatedly leaving games, they will be placed in a low priority queue for several games and need to wait a period of time before joining a  matchmade game. If they leave again during these low priority queue games, the number of games they need to leave the queue is reset to the beginning again, and the wait time will increase. \n\nFrom what you said, it looks like it's been particularly bad in the last few days - it's worth keeping in mind that there were some recent connectivity issues in the past two days that may have played a part in this spike: \n\nhttp://boards.oce.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/announcements/XHGFrU9j-follow-up-on-connection-issues-5032015 \nhttp://boards.oce.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/announcements/IOuWqG7B-resolved-troubleshooting-connection-issues-4032015","replies":[{"poster":"Sw4g3ttiYoL0n4yz","date":"2015-03-06T11:51:02.232+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hi Zaps,\n\nThanks for your response. I haven't seen that LeaverBuster page before and it does do some towards cooling the rage of having had a particularly bad streak of experiences.\n\nOne thing I will say about the system though is that it doesn't have anything featured that gives notice to the affected players if the system catches someone. I understand that player behaviour is about deterrence and punishment rather than retribution and justice, yet I think one of the most frustrating factors in being in a game with AFKs is the feeling of helplessness. The game is practically ruined, there's nothing you can do about it and regardless of whether you report or not you will leave the game with a sour taste in your mouth.\n\nIn my own case, your response has made me feel better. Majority of the time, people don't go to the forums or get a red post (I feels spesh), so they don't get that feeling better, just the frustration from before. \n\nIn either case, hopefully the connection issues have been resolved and that LeaverBuster scares a couple summoners out of leaving their next games, thanks again for your time .","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"A for Acid","date":"2015-03-06T09:20:12.895+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I used to play on NA server, since I live in NZ so I am trying to start a new account on the OCE server.
