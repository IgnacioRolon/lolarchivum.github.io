My ping and FPS are fine and consistent and don&#039;t change at all, the lag spikes happen every 5-10s and they seem to last the smallest fraction of a second, feels like the game is just blinking for a second.\r\n\r\nIt&#039;s not been super destructive but it is progressively getting worse, so I decided to try the usual fixes.\r\n\r\nRepaired the client, updated my drivers, made sure no background processes cramping my style, turned all graphics to as low as they can go (HIGHLY DO NOT RECOMMEND THE GAME LOOKS LIKE A SUN DRIED MANGO PEEL), disabled firewall, disabled Windows Defender, and for ONE NIGHT ONLY it worked fine. Log on again the next day, all fixes still in place and the lag is back, worse than before.\r\n\r\nPretty much lost the game for my team just now as by the end of the game it was near un-playable, would appreciate any help or insight here!\r\n\r\nCheers,\r\nSwag\r\n{{item:3073}}","replies":[{"poster":"Wuks","date":"2018-10-25T11:03:44.456+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"While this very well may be related to a hardware issue, let's try troubleshooting down the software solutions first.
