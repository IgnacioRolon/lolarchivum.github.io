On 9th November, I spent 6000  blue essence(that is a lot ) to buy this ward. But now I can not find it. Is it a BUG or what? Can you give me an explain? Thank you very much.{{sticker:sg-soraka}}","replies":[{"poster":"Tele","date":"2017-12-12T07:37:29.861+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"There's not much that we can do here for you TBH, our power is very limited for this kind of stuff. Your best bet it to get in touch with Riot [here](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/requests/new) and ask them what happened to your ward. \n\nI recommend you use the _\"I have a question about blue essence conversion or rewards\"_ category.","replies":[]}]}
