False reports will gradually invalidate any future reports you make to the point where they're simply ignored.\n\nAs long as you make sure there is viable reason for each report you submit, there should never be a problem.\n\nAlso, it's important to note that the instant feedback system currently only informs the most recent player to report an individual who is punished.","replies":[{"poster":"NoMoreChillies","date":"2016-11-30T06:57:16.167+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":3,"body":"so just because i am Bronze and there is a feeder/troll/DC/toxic player every second game my reports are ignored?\n\nYa I still think  RIOT doesnt care about Bronze\n\nSpending my money elsewhere.

Both are feeding imo. Do RIOT watch the replay's to see their actions?","replies":[{"poster":"Project Xayah","date":"2016-11-30T10:54:01.914+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> I guess i should stop reporting to get a better report weight.....\n\nYou don't have to stop reporting, just avoid reporting out of spite, hate, retaliation etc.\n\n> Do RIOT watch the replays to see their actions?\n\nDon't really need to watch the replays. A good look at various statistics, such as K/D/A, Kill Participation, Champion Role, Position, Item build, CS, Objective Control etc. is (mostly) all that's needed to figure out if someone is intentionally feeding or not.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]}
