I have games recorded where this happens all the time. \n\nI've even had games where i carried and my team constantly berated me like i was some kind of scum who didn't know how to play my main champion.\n\nThen i play janna and shield once or twice or win a fight and people say \"Janna God!\". \n\nOf course it's not constant but i get praise for winning team fights or helping stop a big death all the time. \n\nThe only time i agree is with Supports who initiate fights. Like Alister, Leo, Thresh, Blitz and stuff. Those champs whole job is the start the fight, so pretty much why would they say \"good job\" when you just did what you were meant to do. Now if you stopped a ugly fight and turned it into a win for your team then sure you deserve all the praise. But your entire job as an initiator is to well.. start a fight.\n\nIts like saying \"good job jungle\" every time he kills a dragon or blue/red buff.","replies":[{"poster":"Mozzie25","date":"2016-12-07T00:42:30.978+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Personally I try to go out of my way to try and recognise when my support is doing a good job and be supportive when things are going to plan. \n\nI'd say all the praise is from people who realise that supports sometimes get the short end of the stick when it comes to praise and blame.","replies":[{"poster":"Volcanuz","date":"2016-12-07T18:04:08.104+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Wrong.\n\nUnless you are playing in an ELO made of bots, asians, and retards i doubt you don't get any praise as support.\n\nI really should record/edit all the times i see support get praise and mash it up with me getting massive solo team kills or me smashing a lane in a split push and show the chat for both scenarios and you would see its pretty equal or uneven for those actually doing hard work.\n\nDon't get me wrong i certainly don't think supports don't do anything, if anything support if my most loved role to play and have a good one of, its why my list right now has close to 30 supports on it of all types (damage, heal and tank). I love me a good supp. But it is a pretty straight forward job, and we ADC and others see a LOT of bad supps, so we see the good ones and go \"yeah thats what they are meant to do\" the real difference is you will see people rage faster if you are just a OKAY support, as OKAY supports will pull something out their ass for an amazing play here and there, but still do crazy stupid stuff a good amount of the time so of course they will see the support abuse. And it is mainly because they see the role as a  easy game. \n\nIt's when you main a supp, or main it in general for real and put REAL effort into the role when you see constant \"good work\" and stuff. As i said when i play janna or Sona i constantly get \"OMG YOU'RE A GOD\" or high praise as i main  those champs for support so i better make insane plays. So of course if you just randomly pick up lets say, Naut, play him and just do okay its normal for you to not get any praise. \n\nI think supps think they can get away with just playing mediocre and expect high praise for just doing their job and it is insane that they think they can do that. Getting an S+ on a support ISN'T That big a thing. All you need for S+ is under 35 mins of gameplay, under 4 deaths, 60 cs, and depending on the supp champion 16-24 assists. Kills some times weigh more but only for certain supports.  Compare that to say, twitch, who needs 15+ kills, 2 deaths, 310 CS, over 4 assists and under 30 minutes of gameplay. And you can see why the S+ idea OP is suggesting is stupid.\n\nIf you struggle to get s- or S+ as support you should really rethink how you pick your support champion, or how you support as it is the easiest role to get S+ for (ask my supports who all have 4 supp champs with M7). Its rare to see a support main without a M7 champ. Take my family freind, He has 4 supps at M7 and he doesn't even main support.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Miicka","date":"2016-12-06T14:16:14.037+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=dragon poo,realm=OCE,application-id=FjGAIbRv,discussion-id=1KPeEA0E,comment-id=0000,timestamp=2016-12-06T13:43:56.746+0000)\n>\n> i love when everyone says GJ &quot;adc&quot;, when i do all the set up. support isnt meant to be rewarding, its like working for the government, everyone blames you if shit goes south, but no on acknowledges you if it goes well\n\nLMAO THAT IS THE BEST COMPARISON IVE EVER HEARD HAHAHHAHAA ITS SO TRUE","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Cakemeisting","date":"2016-12-06T16:30:18.510+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":1,"body":"Support is rewarding, it just requires a different mindset to a carry.","replies":[{"poster":"Volcanuz","date":"2016-12-07T18:05:56.645+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"This exactly.\n\nYou just got to know you did your job, and be proud of your self.

The lower the level of play the less consistent it is, and the less likely a player is to be able to play multiple roles (or even multiple champs). For many, support is either a main role or a way down the list of prefs role (whether they can play it or not), and since it requires a completely different mentality to play, many people in the lower levels of play do not wish to learn it, since it means a vast shift from what they are used to. \n\nThat coupled with this: http://askghostcrawler.tumblr.com/post/153923542358/how-many-competing-theories-are-there-answering is why many people do not want to play support, and this is especially true in lower levels of play where flexibility is very limited.\n\nAutofill exists because without it queues in high elos where pop is small, and low elo where there aren't enough supports are 20+ minutes. @0 minutes is the maximum punishment for afking and leaving games, so regular players facing those queue times is not ok. \n\nDo I think support could be more rewarding? Sure. Do I think much of that reward lies in a perspective shift from the community? Yes.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"DarkShade918","date":"2016-12-07T23:37:53.585+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"is m7 with thresh and m6 with nami, karma, and janna\n\nDoesn't care for accolades, awards, thanks.\n\nAnother board member told me, you don't get thanked for doing your job.
