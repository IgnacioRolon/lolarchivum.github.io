This is actually quite interesting, like there's no other word to describe it.\nI'd think it'd be insanely difficult to implement but I actually think it's possible. I'm thinking maybe start off with the 'fundamental' ones like QWERSDF. I can imagine it to be like a 'main' poke ability key, a 'main' mobility key, like a lot of champions have mobility on E like Lucian or as you said, Cait or Wukong or Shen. It'd be helpful definitely to have our own custom mappings for different champions. Depending on what's left in the future, but we could potentially stretch that out to different maps and perhaps even implemented like Item Sets (if they're every going to be a thing again).","replies":[]}]}
