Ganking\nIn my experience, Shaco has more potential GANKING pressure than Rengar or Fizz. Shacos kit allows for more cc and more consistent map pressure, though you could argue that rengar has just as much kill pressure from his stealth and kit. In all honesty, if you prefer early ganking pressure and snowballing, go Shaco. If you want more of a damage oriented gank, mid to late game Rengar has arguably more impact. Fizz's ganks are a non-factor compared to Shaco/Rengar because he has very little cc and has to walk into lane to maximise potential damage. Although Fizz has a better dive than both of Shaco and Rengar if you save his Playful/Trickster.\n\nShaco can gank effectively with only 2 levels, one in Deceive and on in his Boxes. If your laner has some hard cc to chain with your box, you will be guaranteed a kill or to at least blow flash. Rengars Ganks become their most potent when he gets his Ultimate and so may not provide as much early pressure. Fizz's ganks are lackluster should u have little cc or your opponent has some mobility. Fizz can get a bit better once he has his ulti.\nShaco/Rengar>Rengar/Shaco>Fizz\n\n2. Laning phase\nFizz has arguably the best laning phase, not going to go into detail. Rengar is also seen in the top lane where the brushes favour him, though he has little sustain outside of an Empowered W meaning if he cant go all in and get the kill he will have a hard time gaining lane dominance. Shaco typically doesnt see the laning phase outside of AP Shaco, whos laning itself is pretty poor. Being so squishy and a melee means that he has trouble csing with his AAs though, his boxes can help him cs slightly better. His Shiv when leveled provides a consistent amount of damage to cs or trade with once it has levels, a bit of AP and some MagPen. AD shaco is rarely ever seen in lane. Overall Fizz>Rengar>Shaco\n\n3. Taking objectives\nAll of these champs have decent Objective control. AD Shaco with Static Shiv or Hydra is a good split pusher. He is also good at taking towers if left alone with the aid of his clone. Shaco also has good Dragon control because he can juggle dragon with his boxes and his clone, giving him the ability of two champs to take it. Shaco is also really good at smiting away objectives such as dragon and baron. Shaco can reliably jump walls at baron and dragon and surprise the enemy with a calculated smite, while the other jungler not expecting an outsmite. In my Personal experience, i have stolen large amounts of dragons and Barons reliably with Shaco. Fizz's tower pushing is fairly good without much items. His playful/trickster is good to clear waves and the Lich Bane he always should build allows him to take towers quickly. While Fizz doesnt have neutral objective control as much as shaco or rengar, he does apply pressure during dragon/baron skirmishes due to his high mobility and damage, meaning a low jungler is an easy target for fizz to kill. Rengar has a bit of both, building a Hydra he can push waves and take towers quickly with his Empowered Q Attack Speed Buff. He can solo dragon with a few items and lifesteal easily due to his high innate damage and tankyness/heals from his Roar. He also finds it easy to assassinate low targets during dragons.\n\nIf we are talking purely about objectives, Shaco>Rengar>Fizz. If we are talking about capitalising and killing on the opponents doing objectives, Fizz>Rengar>Shaco.\n\n4. Snowballing\nAll assassins have innate snowballing potential. Shaco has the ability to do so early and into the mid game but tapers off towards the endgame. Fizz also has the same ability and can quickly snowball hard if he plays safe in lane and knows when to go aggressive. Lane Fizz doesnt drop off nearly as hard throughout the game and has consistent amounts of damage if he stays even or gets ahead. Jungle Fizz however takes a bit longer to ramp up than Lane Fizz but still scales into a monster. Rengar is very Hyper-Polar when it comes to Snowballing. Much like Aatrox, if you get ahead u can snowball ahead, but if you get behind your gonna have a tough time getting back into the game. Ryan Choi, a very well known Top Lane Rengar shows how hard you can snowball if you successfully win you lane as Rengar. One good thing as rengar is that even if you are losing lane, you can easily hit 6 and Roam Bot lane and use ult for easy kills on the squishy bot laners should they be gankable and you have your team mates to back you up. Rengar starts to pick up mid to late game and sits just under Fizz in terms of snowballing if rengar builds appropriately.\n\nOverall Fizz>Rengar>Shaco\n\n5. Who do you like the most? or if you havent played them who scares you the most?\n\nI tend to play a lot of Shaco but have used Fizz a fair bit as well as Rengar. I prefer Shaco's utility based ganking as it can help snowball a hypercarry fairly quickly if done right. I also tend not to go full Crit/Damage shaco as i find it not necessary if your carries get ahead. I transition into a tanky bruiser shaco who can peel and take a bit of damage towards mid to late game. I also build him so he can split push effectively with Hydra and if i need to push quick and take towers quick i may go Shiv/Phantom Dancer. I find Fizz does really well no matter how you play him due to his scaling and Kit. Ive both jungled and Laned as Fizz and both are powerful. I dont really play much fizz however. I have Played Rengar seldomly in both jungle and top and find him a bit more difficult to use. He has lackluster jungling atm and a lot of people dont understand how he is played which annoys me.\n\nWho scares me the most? Fizz. Fizz is always going to do tonnes of damage and is very hard to lock down if you have little cc. His ability to dive and then lose tower agro is hard to lane against. Due to the amount of bad rengar players and how mechanically complex he can be, i dont think rengar is much of a threat. I have played against high elo rengars with shaco and out perform them a lot more often. You only should be afraid of rengar if you are squishy and he has his ult. other than that he doesnt apply a lot of pressure outside high performing competitive players. Shaco is also a very slippery champ that can be a real pain if he plays well. A good shaco can go from Top to Mid to Bot in the first 5 minutes and secure 3 or more kills very easily. His constant invisibility pressure means that if you want to survive in lane you dont want to over extend unless you can take 2v1 or 3v2.\n\nWho i like the most, Shaco>Fizz>Rengar\nWho i fear the most, Fizz>Shaco>Rengar\n\nNow im not going to tell you who you should play and i think you should make that decision yourself, but you can use what i have told you to guide your decision.\n\nEDIT: Riots Website screws up Ordered Lists when i paste 1-5","replies":[{"poster":"JonahGreen","date":"2014-12-21T20:12:34.319+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thank you! :)","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Justify","date":"2014-12-21T07:09:47.361+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"The amount of bronze in this post","replies":[]},{"poster":"JonahGreen","date":"2014-12-21T09:04:01.989+0000","up_votes":0,"down_votes":0,"body":"Can i have a serious answer?","replies":[]},{"poster":"Sulbatamol","date":"2014-12-21T08:09:06.452+0000","up_votes":0,"down_votes":1,"body":"laning phase? stop coming to my lane and take my farm jgler ffs.","replies":[]},{"poster":"JonahGreen","date":"2014-12-21T07:01:01.931+0000","up_votes":0,"down_votes":1,"body":"As shaco can he only jungle or can he lane? if so what lane?","replies":[]}]}
