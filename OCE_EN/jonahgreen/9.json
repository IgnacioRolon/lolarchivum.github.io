This is because you'll always struggle to trade effectively in lane without the sustained damage that can be applied by a marksman / ADC. \n\nThis generally means either:\n\n1) High CC Lockdown + High Damage bot lanes. This includes combos with J4/Xin/Leo/Pantheon/Alistar/Taric/Sion/Poppy with each other,  or with an easily applied CC mage with burst, like Annie/Veigar/Syndra/Kennen. If you get ahead with early kills in this lane, the enemy bot lane will struggle to get farm for a very long time due to your huge lockdown + kill threat. You'll likely not want to push down their tower because once you take it, it's a lot safer for them to farm, and you can't apply your threat anywhere near as well.\n\n2) Sustained Damage Mages - The best example here is generally Ryze - he's able to apply consistent magic damage at medium-ish range, and with protection from a good support can manage to scale well with items just as well as experience. Other characters that work well like this include Azir (who works kinda like a marksman) and Lulu (who has ridiculously strong auto-attacks when itemised for it, combined with her natural tanky ult/shield and W utility).\n\nKennen is also a bit of dark horse here for either field: he [has one of the best attack speeds](http://leagueoflegends.wikia.com/wiki/List_of_champions%27_attack_speed), especially early - and [compares favourably on AD](http://leagueoflegends.wikia.com/wiki/List_of_champions%27_attack_damage) with most typical ADC, as well as a reasonable 550 auto range. This pretty unique stat makeup, no mana, and some pretty useful skills for bot lane (longer range harass, movement, AR/MR boost, build in stun, a great auto attack booster and an aoe ultimate that he can auto attack during!) let him act as a bully to ADCs early, and then lets him build as as a straight mage (or pretty much anything!) as he begins to build items.","replies":[{"poster":"JonahGreen","date":"2014-12-05T18:21:02.136+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"So kennen would be a good choice?","replies":[{"poster":"Zaps","date":"2014-12-05T23:56:48.861+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Depends on what your friend is playing!
