And shaco will kill his first camp really fast.\n\nShaco the most fun with stealth and box and ult. Pantheon is just kinda boring if you ask me, udyr can be fun to run around on really fast. Shaco / udyr alot more build paths than pantheon also. \n\nBest sustain.... depends how you build them / play them i would say. However shaco isn't as suited to building tanky items like the other two. All can get lifesteal but i probably wouldnt bother on udyr most matches cause he better of with something with movespeed / attack speed (no botrk isnt a \"movespeed\" item it wont get across the map faster) but i might consider it if im fighting a bruiser/tank with alot of lifesteal like warwick. Shacos pretty much a glass cannon but good use of boxes + damage will keep him going for a time however you would probably get crits/pene over sustain for him. Udyr can be full tank to bruiser, panth is a bruiser / glass and shaco is glass (well when built optimal anyway)","replies":[]},{"poster":"MlkyIceCrmyShk","date":"2014-12-02T09:03:00.913+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"***","replies":[{"poster":"Akuen","date":"2014-12-03T00:26:13.192+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> shaco is only good in a 1v1 situation and not in team fights like, he dosent help the team as much as himself not a good jungle to take seriously but fun for a laugh. Udyr is jsut a hcamp that farms and dosent gank, he just come out of late game beast but the thing is  becasue of no ganks they enemy might be better than you and as we all know league players get mad easily.\n\nSomeone that clearly doesn't know how to play Shaco/Udyr. Just because they're harder to teamfight with, doesn't mean you can't teamfight with them. Just because Udyr scales well with farm, doesn't mean all Udyrs are going to mindlessly farm the Jungle.\n\nOP: Play something you enjoy playing, that you know how to play.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"TheTourist","date":"2014-12-02T10:34:51.886+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You're forgetting about taking and controlling objectives.

Goodluck seeing him played in ranked with his high ban rate.
