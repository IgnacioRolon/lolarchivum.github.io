\nyou have to watch when they roam tho, i had a Kat mid and azir counters her, so i spent the whole laning phase keeping her out of the game she had less than 1/3 of my farm and i had a kill on her, but she roamed and i called mia, but she still got a triple kill botlane and once Kat gets that its pretty hard to shut her down,\n\nbut other tips i can give you is, you can afford to be aggressive with pushing the lane, because he has one of the longest dashes in the game and  his ult is the best disengage ever, and he has a meaty slow, you can escape almost any gank when your ult is up so dont be afraid to push them right to their turret use w on the turret and deny them farm ect. (as long as you have mana and cd's to escape) \nalso unless you know for sure where the enemy jungler is dont use both w's on their turret, even though its tempting for that damage, junglers have that habit of showing up when you have no soldiers left.\n\nwhen roaming, the main thing is to land your E, not only does it give you a shield but it allows the members of that lane to catch up and sets you up for an ult to push them back into your teammates. so sometimes its best to use WQ combo just in front of the fleeing enemy so then when you E it won't miss (this is of course situational) \n\nif fighting someone with a channel such as fiddlesticks or katarina save your E until they use it, to interrupt the channel and give you a shield, this will win you most fights against those champions. \n\nalso you can WE over the nexus on your way to lane (as the nexus is slightly longer than your w cast range so it extends the range when you cast it, and reduces the time of walking around the nexus/towers)\n\nAlso your ult starts slightly behind azir so even if they are slightly behind you, it is still possible to push them.\n\nbe aware tho that if they can see you soldiers they can see you and vice versa so if you are low hp and go into a bush to recall but there are still soldiers on the field, champions like jinx and Ezreal have a free kill on you if their ults are up. this also means you cant spam 3 soldiers in the bush and rape the jungler when they come to gank.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Rok","date":"2014-12-25T22:17:23.469+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"1.
