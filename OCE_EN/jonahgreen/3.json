NOt much mechanics, but an ult + flash + body slam always look cool.\n\nNidalee (3150 ip). Can be AD or AP top or mid. Strong lane bully and splitpusher if you go AD. Better team fighter and sieger if you go AP. Requires some level of mechanics to use well.\n\nXin Zhao (1350 ip), though he's pretty mindless.
