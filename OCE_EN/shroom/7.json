I have created this board to share my thoughts on the new meta: Hybrid Jax. Most of you would have probably come across a jax that builds hybrid; {{item:3124}} {{item:3146}} {{item:3078}} . Well if you have, then you know that it has to be nerfed. I was playing today and came across a hybrid jax. I remembered from Brofresco's vid (shout out to the brofrescini) that hybrid jax DESTROYS. Well.... in just 8mins into the game, jax could 1v2 ( i was playing katarina). Then in 30mins, jax could 1v4. The damage that jax dealt was CRAZY. It took him 3 AUTO-ATTACKS to kill our zed, and the same for me. So if any people from riot happen to read my board, please take into account what Brofresco and i have said. ;) Thanks!{{champion:24}}  Oh and as you can see on the thumbnail of brofrescos video, one hit did half hp to the enemy champion.","replies":[{"poster":"Magic Rasta","date":"2015-12-19T21:50:03.890+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":1,"body":"Why does anyone watch this kid?
