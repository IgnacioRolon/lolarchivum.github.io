Roles are:\n1)  top \n2) mid \n3) jg \n4) adc \n5) sup. \n\nThose listed in the poll are classes. Note that different class can fulfill different roles.\nI personally enjoy jungling when I'm tired of the standard laning phase. It provides a different gameplay compared to the other above listed roles.","replies":[{"poster":"Shroom","date":"2015-02-17T08:14:21.043+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"No, I disagree.

Which makes me always feel like I need to play support with all my friends because I know of their capabilities. I have 2 friends who completely scared of jungling because they don't know how to do it.
