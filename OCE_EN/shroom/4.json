The best thing you can do is to be positive and work around it as best you can, as it'll usually stop them from getting any worse and may produce some good plays and teamwork. That said, for most people their best bet is to just mute them and continue to play the game as normal, and then report them in post game.\n\nIt's beyond frustrating, believe me I know. As a Support main, I know exactly the kind of crap you'll get from players who refuse to see their own mistakes. That said, you can't let it get to you. We have to remember that these players are in the minority, and most of this behaviour is a result of frustration rather than a premeditated desire to be toxic. It doesn't stop the frustration we get in turn, but it's important to maintain that perspective if you wanna be able to move on from it.","replies":[]}]}
