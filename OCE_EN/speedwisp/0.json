Generally melee champs are weak vs ranged, but fizz hits his powerspikes early and will usually decimate and immobile ranged target. If Riot removed every champ that had a \"QQ RITO REMOVE X!\" thread about them, we would only be left with Ashe.\n\n* Champions that are able to match his burst/have short cooldowns are usually your best bet against him (Diana, Talon, Akali). \n\n* He is a burst champion, and will usually go in for the kill if you have used your CC/ defense, or are low mana/health. It is way better to back and miss some CS than stay in lane and die to a fizz. \n\n* In terms of itemization vs him, it really depends on what build path he is going. Pick up some early defensive items to counter his burst. QSS and Zhonyas also work a treat in terms of negating his ult damage.\n\n* Dodge his ult\n\n* Bait out his troll poll (but don't use your CC in doing so). Engage on him/poke us much as you can while this is down. \n\n[TL;DR He doesn't need to be removed, you just have to learn how to counterplay. ](https://www.reddit.com/r/summonerschool/comments/2hrrsx/how_to_counter_fizz_properly/)","replies":[]}]}
