It begins with a black screen at which you have to press enter, then an empty champion screen appears for a split second before immediately crashing and the reconnect button is prompted.\r\nSo far the steps I have taken in this order are: Repairing the client -&gt; Uninstalling and reinstalling League of Legends -&gt; Repairing again (idk why haha) -&gt; Forcing a repatch. Then today I upgraded my OSX from yosemite to El capitan and launching a game in custom worked. Immediately trying to play a normal after brought the whole problem back and now nothing works.\r\n\r\nJust so you know, I don&#039;t have lolreplay or avast or any firewall or antivirus&#039; \r\nI&#039;ve opened a ticket a few days ago but they always ask confusing things at extended notice so if anyone has a solution I would be more than grateful :)))){{sticker:slayer-jinx-catface}}","replies":[{"poster":"SephirothSG","date":"2016-02-13T23:56:01.329+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey there,\n\nWhat confusing questions did support ask you?\nHave you tried out the fixes listed for Mac under the [Bug Splat & Game Crashes](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201761974-Bug-Splat-and-Game-Crashes#section-mac) article?","replies":[]},{"poster":"Sophiee","date":"2016-02-13T23:30:15.363+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Same problem","replies":[]}]}
