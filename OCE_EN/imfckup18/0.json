Quick Question tho would it be a straight line skill shot or more like a {{champion:112}}  Death Ray ?\n\nIce Prison is a cool ability though for an aoe the stun duration is pretty violent_ (perhaps making a literal prison that makes impassable walls around the area, similar effect with perhaps a shorter stun upon activation. (it would present more control and other uses for the ability like blocking off passages (that said it would need a delay before activation to present counterplay) _\n\nThe ultimate is great it presents counterplay and teamfight potential.  \n\nCool champion overall i would love to see this champion on the rift \n\ni'd like to hear your opinion on some of my works \n\n[Rasnor: The Spectral Guardian](http://boards.oce.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/player-creations/6mBUx6yA-rasnor-the-spectral-guardian)\n\n[Cimaans, the Stage Magican](http://boards.oce.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/player-creations/xFy2xJAN-champion-concept-cimaans-the-stage-magican)\n\n[Seigvarth The Inquisitor.\n](http://boards.oce.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/player-creations/fTgsrmAI-seigvarth-the-inquisitor)\n\n[Nechrouths, The Bones awoken](http://boards.oce.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/player-creations/qzRZqARV-champion-concept-nechrouths-the-bones-awoken)","replies":[]},{"poster":"Blu3 burgler","date":"2016-05-31T22:34:35.511+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Cool idea and I think that dark gate is right a few things that need changing and please check out my champ Linc, the riftwalk experiment thanks and this champ is blu3 burgler approved ðŸ˜†","replies":[]}]}
