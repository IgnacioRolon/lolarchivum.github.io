Nothing better then getting punished for not wanting to put up with abuse.\n\nOr you can\n\nC: Click the Mute button, and then report them at the end of the game screen for Verbal Abuse etc.\n\nThe abusers will only never face consequences  if you don't report them, click the button, and the system does the rest. Sure, the enemy team might not report them (although in my experience, many players are happy to purely to limit the chances of them receiving toxic players in future queues) but as long as you do, the report gets logged. \n\nOne of the hardest things to do in game is ignoring abuse, especially if it's unwarranted, but it's better in the long run. If you hit back, you still get 4 other people abusing you back, AND said premade has an entirely justified reason for reporting you at the end of the game. If you mute them, they have limited options, since so long as you didn't retaliate, any report against you would be  false one (which IIRC also get punished).\n\nFailing to retaliate also has a secondary outcome, which is that it (occasionally) results in you having a better success rate at winning the game. I remember jungling once as Kha'Zix. Bottom Lane was (probably justifiably) frustrated I had failed to find a successful gank, mid lane was likely frustrated at getting camped by the enemy jungler. Obviously the abuse started to flow in, but I didn't lash out. A short time later, I managed to get a couple of double kills, and the team dropped the abuse and the negativity, and a good 30 minutes later, the team pulled together and we won the game. I'm not suggesting this is going to happen every game, or even once every ten games, but I don't honestly remember a time when flaming someone has actually successfully resulted in us having a better chance at winning.","replies":[]},{"poster":"NOBLE105","date":"2015-10-30T02:00:55.512+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"i have to agree, all i like is a functional team and a good game but abusive players have been an issue, i report but no action seems to get taken","replies":[]},{"poster":"fattyhotdogs","date":"2015-10-30T00:51:22.395+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I don't get abused much.
