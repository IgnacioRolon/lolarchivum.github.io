The first time I played Morg in ranked, I had just come back from playing her in EUW during holiday, and went on a winning streak. Technically, I first timed Morg for my OCE account, and it went splendidly, on the other hand, I have near 300k mastery on shaco, if you see me playing shaco in ranked, there is a 60% chance we will lose this game. Which would you prefer?","replies":[]}]}
