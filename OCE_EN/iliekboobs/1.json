It's also not uncommon for high ranked players to play pretty much exclusively ranked, and only play normals with friends every now and again which has the unfortunate effect of thoroughly skewing their normals MMR.\n\nPlenty of higher ranked players will also only rarely play their main champions (and often their main roles) in normals, so their visible rank doesn't necessarily reflect their actual skill for whatever combination they're playing that game.\n\nThe best you can do in these scenarios is either have fun with the game or just learn as much as you can by observation.","replies":[]}]}
