Usually it's the opposite, there's too many people playing. It's school holidays atm so there are more people playing for longer. If your primary role is a popular one then the more people playing the worse the oversaturation of people trying to get that role, and the more likely you are to get your secondary, especially if you're secondary is a less popular role like support.","replies":[{"poster":"Shana Rei","date":"2018-10-10T22:13:49.422+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You saw that and it would seem obvious except for the fact that it has happened to me for the last couple of nights as well.\nExcept I primary support, secondary jungle and have had jungle 4/5 games.","replies":[{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2018-10-11T09:44:33.025+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Odd, I have thee same role prefs as you and have seen jungle once in the last month~.
