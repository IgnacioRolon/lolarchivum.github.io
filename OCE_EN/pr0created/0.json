When logging in the client asks you what are the two positions you like to play (or the client recognises the two positions you play the most) so when someone hovers over your name in the friends list they can see what position you like to play. This would make parties easier to construct. There has been so many games where in a party three people want to go mid, or that the normal lobby is just so chaotic. I also think it would encourage gameplay with friends.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Jonius7","date":"2016-06-07T16:52:07.838+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I like both ideas.\n\nFor the game improvement info, I would want different coloured text or some separation between the different fields of Champion, KDA, Team Score, TIme.\n\nAbout the game highlight one, that'd be really cool, though that could require updates to how they currently handle spectator mode and/or connections between the client, and the game. Some third party programs already offer instant replays of deaths in-game or similar.","replies":[{"poster":"pr0created","date":"2016-06-08T02:54:42.901+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"i agree with you on both points\n\nSeparation and colour would be neccessary\n\nAs for the highlights feasibility is my biggest concern about it as well but I think with enough effort or resources put in it could be done","replies":[]}]}]}
