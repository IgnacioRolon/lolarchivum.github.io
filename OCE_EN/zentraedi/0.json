BUT I want a semi-simple explanation on what&#039;s going on!!!!\r\ne.g. when I first started this game (back 5-6 years ago) I read on {{champion:19}} &#039;s lore saying that it was {{champion:16}}  who turned him into the wolf. Now it talks about him trying to hunt her down but didn&#039;t succeed and old mate {{champion:27}} making a {{item:2033}} for him to turn into a wolf......\r\n\r\nWith the latest story of Shurima coming in. I just wondered if anyone has done a video or a discussion on what everyone&#039;s relationship/connection was between {{champion:268}} {{champion:69}} {{champion:32}} {{champion:101}} {{champion:75}} {{champion:58}} {{champion:15}} {{champion:33}} ..... The story&#039;s just wayyy too long hahaha. Like when {{champion:69}}  first came out wasn&#039;t she sister&#039;s with {{champion:55}} ????\r\n\r\nIf they (as in someone from League) could actually do a short video, doesn&#039;t have to be a cinematic), explaining it would be awesome.\r\n\r\nEG DAMACIA   VS    NOXUS\r\n\r\n\r\n{{champion:86}} {{champion:102}} {{champion:5}} {{champion:67}} {{champion:114}} {{champion:99}} {{champion:59}} {{champion:37}} {{champion:133}} \r\nVS\r\n{{champion:27}} {{champion:19}} {{champion:6}} {{champion:7}} {{champion:14}} {{champion:91}} {{champion:50}} {{champion:122}} {{champion:119}}","replies":[{"poster":"bloodmoth","date":"2016-05-14T05:59:02.288+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Old lore was a mess, basically just read on everything after the freljord event, as thats the only relevant lore, everything else is basically obsolete.\n\nCBF with doing a TLDR, just read the new lores, they are all that is relevant.\n\nAnd kat and cas are both still noxians, cas just went to shurima for ancient power and stuff then got cursed.\n\nAs for warwick, just wait for his rework and new lore, Riot is building up to a Zaun event soon with the WW rework, and a bunch of champions heading over there","replies":[]}]}
