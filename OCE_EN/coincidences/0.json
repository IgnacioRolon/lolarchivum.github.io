But in ranked is EVERY single champion in the League of Legends is in the champion pool. (Excluding the 6 Champs banned during Champion Select)\r\n\r\nI think this would be awesome, ARAM is really cool when Summoners Rift is getting repetitive. I would love to see Ranked ARAM and think lot&#039;s of people would enjoy it.\r\n\r\nThanks jimmyyy221\r\n\r\n(Also Ranked ARAM Teams would be good)","replies":[{"poster":"JasonWazza","date":"2015-03-29T03:08:40.406+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"\"Ranked\" i'm sorry but how can randomness be competitive?\n\nThis basically turns into \"You can have challenger if your really fucking lucky\"","replies":[{"poster":"Coincidences","date":"2015-03-29T03:14:53.618+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I get what you mean, I just really enjoy ARAM and would love to play champs that I am not comfortable with.
