Spending over 15k IP on Hextech Mystery Champion Chards, I still struggle to obtain enough blue essence to get champion mastery, therefore have thought of a solution. Just thought of an idea, because you might not want certain champions with level 6 and 7 champion mastery or in my case are struggling to obtain blue essence, you can disenchant tokens. Example #1 could be and S- gives 50 blue essence, S gives 100 and S+ gives 200. Example #2 could be level 6 tokens give 100 blue essence and level 7 tokens give 200 blue essence. Just an idea","replies":[]}
