It finally lets me but it took so long It appears I &quot;left the game&quot; when my computer simply lags. I now have to repeat leaverbuster for my computers mistakes, is there a way you guys can remove it from my account? I generally wanted to play and didn&#039;t leave on purpose. Please reply, we all make / have bad luck, don&#039;t punish us for it, sometimes its not our fault. Riot please pay attention to this and hopefully remove my leaverbuster or understand these issues. Thank you.","replies":[]}
