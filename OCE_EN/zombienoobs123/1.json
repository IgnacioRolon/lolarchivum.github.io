Please read this, we all have stories similar to this, Riot.","subforum":"Gameplay & Strategy","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"I was playing a game of LoL, a few games actually. When I got warnings and chat restrictions for cussing at &quot;bad players&quot; and jerks in general, after that I noticed that I have become part of the community of toxic players (Which is the majority of the community no offence) and so I relised this, my next few games AFTER chat restriction I had been more nice, less toxic and generally treated my team well. I&#039;d argue with people who argue&#039;d with me first, not swearing of course, just simply saying some nasty things that didn&#039;t involve swears, I get reported again without using any swears. And some games I&#039;d just flat out get reported without saying much besides communicating with my team (not in a bad way). Then I get ANOTHER chat restriction. At this point I&#039;m quite upset and annoyed at these occurrences. So I just flat out give up on being goody two-shoes. I just ignore people and flame when i want to flame. (Now Lets Cut To The Point)\r\nI was playing bot lane and we were doing well, nothing to bad, when suddenly, there jgler ganked. That was there first gank, which when we died he replied &quot;Rekt&quot;. We would continue playing, he would gank more and more to the part where he was pracitcally a part of bot lane, evertime we died  he&#039;d always, ALWAYS type &quot;rekt&quot; or &quot;lel&quot;. Which if you didnt know Riot, is typically used to bm or troll. Then there mid laner would gank more and more. I had enough I began typing in  all chat, and there mid laner  would reply &quot;Let the anger out&quot; So I asummed she was ok with me getting toxic and salty, I was wrong.. As I began flaming she then began saying &quot;rekt&quot; and &quot;lel&quot; thats all they would say, I got mad, and mad, and mad. I had been so annoyed by these annoying trolls that I began cussing. After the game I got reported by the trolls. Now my account is bannedfor 14 days, i cant spend my LoL card I might be getting for christmas on those discounts for 2 skins I REALLY wanted.\r\n\r\n**IN CONCLUSION**\r\n**I am getting punished big time near christmas for reacting to awful trolls who&#039;s intentions are to annoy and make people flame just like I did yet they  aren&#039;t getting banned and are allowed to be playing game after game of not cussing but intentionally trolling and making people rage, Why are we punished for having to release anger at trolls who do this to us? Some of us (like I  did) get so caught up in  rage that we forget there is a mute button. So please riot, just un-ban me and any other players that go through this, we all make mistakes. Show a bit of care to the LoL community.

Its simple. If it is a team mate, still mute them; you still have a variety of pings to communicate with them.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Rocka","date":"2015-12-23T02:31:19.901+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I know what you mean man, i have the same issues but the only thing we can do is just try to ignore and keep our cool.

There is absolutely no reason to use bad language or verbally abuse someone in a game. You could gently point out what your duo laner is doing wrong to try and stop the feeding, but being toxic is a waste of time.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Hyde","date":"2015-12-23T21:05:05.045+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I mean like to be honest ... i'm really not trying to offend you and I get that it sucks you might not be able to get the skins you wanted... but there are ways to stop that even from the beginning... oh the jungler ganked.. oh what do I need to do... put a pink ward in the tribush talk to your support, say that they should prioritize the sight-stone first if they haven't got it already.. if the mid comes down and the jungler and you try to 4v2 ... then just sit back at your turret ping for your jungler to come and help.. if he can't then ping top top push up his wave and if your jungler isn't bot then let him know to go help top or even just push mid. I play a lot of bot lane and it can really get hit hard with ganks and I can get mad but instead of letting the enemy team wind you up just, change your thoughts and play harder, play to win against them and of course you're going to die at some point and thats ok because it happens. just take that moment to asses the game, look over your build work out want you are going to do next. Most importantly just have fun, if the enemy taunts you with \"rekt\" then just taunt them back with some lame comment like \"cri\" or \"lel\" and everyone will be happier. If you just have to mute everyone and get down to some hard AFK farming then thats ok too.. just so long as you are helping your team. Maybe buy some ards and wounder around looking at the beautiful map while dropping them off is some key areas. After all its just a game, not designed to make players hate each other but to have fun and practice and improve and enjoy the rewarding feeling of getting a triple kill 3v1 after a week of playing only sivir .. or whatever  :3 Just have fun and relax and stop caring about the other team trying to wind you up... it can never get you any place good. \nI hope things improve for you and you have some good times and I hope you get your skins and have a wonderful Christmas.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Zombienoobs123","date":"2015-12-24T09:31:24.695+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Alot of people have said this so I wont reply to one person, as I mentioned (well atleast I think I did) Some people like me get so enraged, angered and annoyed that we forget about the mute button, I forgot all about it threw that argument, all I could do was cuss at them because I was so annoyed and angry.\n\nEDIT: I'm usually a nice guy, I main support and play normals because I don't care about ranks, just having fun, and to be honest when I ADC Im usually very toxic, and I guess I kinda snapped, but its annoying that people I mentioned above can still play games and pull of the devious irritating acts they did to me, Merry Christmas everybody.","replies":[]}]}
