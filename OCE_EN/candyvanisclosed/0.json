If you report someone via the in-game system and have additional information you wish to add that you may not have popped into your in-game report, you can then open a support ticket and pass the information on through there to aid the investigation into the player. I think that's the point Sephyre was getting to with the support ticket.\n\nI dislike toxic behaviour as much as the next person, and by reporting offending players and not contributing to toxic behaviour is how we can help overcome it\n{{sticker:slayer-pantheon-thumbs}}","replies":[{"poster":"CandyVanisClosed","date":"2015-11-17T07:14:19.244+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":3,"body":"Erm no the player in question is a plain out feeder and abuses the reporting system....\nSo the toxic behaviour you speak of is a re-action from some 1 else's action...\nAnd by opening a support ticket is plain out saying the game is failing in the reporting system....\nIve said this before and i will say it again,if there are players who report others for nothing they get punished for doing nothing...\nFor every action there is a reaction which is toxic typing can you not even see what im saying...\nThere are players that KNOW they wont get a thing done to them because of the system that is in place right now....\nThis player and his friend have been doing it for ages and not 1 thing has been done....\nIt took them well over a year to get rid of RamRam.....\nDo players have to put up with this......\nNo they shouldn't there is no witch hunt here m8,its just plain out truth.\nIm more then happy to give you the players dets so you can make your own mind up tbh...\nBy saying there reporting system works is wrong plain out wrong....\nThis has been going on for years,and it wont change because no1 has the balls to ban players....\nIts ok to take there money,but dont ban them.....","replies":[{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2015-11-17T11:24:05.665+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Support tickets against players are for extra information, not because the system is failing.\n\nAnd..sure everyone gets pissed off at that toxic ass player and tilts themselves every now and again but... two toxics don't make a positive, it just makes double the toxic.\n\nIf you think the system isn't seeing them, then put in a support ticket, it's not that hard, and usually they will get them a second look.\n\nI think you have several misunderstandings about human psychology to think that reacting to toxic with toxic is gonna help you any. YOU are the person you have control over, so YOU can take your toxic out and it's as simple as muting or not responding. \n\nI'm not saying you should magically not get frustrated, but maybe use your damn brain a little. You're complaining about someone being toxic, and maybe those that saw the name could the scores sure, but from our perspective, you're the toxic one here m8. Sephyre gave you the board rules which you should have already read, and LemonHunter tried to give you an honest, simple answer and you just went off at them. Yeah, that's really gonna help people not be toxic ey.","replies":[{"poster":"CandyVanisClosed","date":"2015-11-17T20:21:47.265+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":3,"body":"***","replies":[{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2015-11-18T01:00:43.500+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'm not saying the system isn't flawed, or rather, not aggressive enough. I agree. At the very least I think it should be a few more than just the last game reports that get a notification when a player is punished, because I believe it happens more than we see which is incredibly frustrating. If there was more transparency we'd be happier. I would rather an intentional feeder than a toxic anyday, and you seem to misunderstand the system. They CAN'T abuse the report system IF their reports are invalid.\n\nHere's the thing. If they intentionally feed they'll get picked up by the intent feed system ok. The only way they are abusing the report system is by keeping their reports legitimate, you know how they do that? They only report legit toxic people. So if they bait you into toxicity and you respond, then you're only helping them. If you don't get toxic then their report is illegitimate and their reports get thrown out and lose weight, you understand? By responding with toxicity you're making the game worse for yourself and helping them out.\n\nIf you wanna respond to toxic with toxic then fine, but don't call bullshit when you get punished for it. You'll get punished for  consistent toxicity eventually whether you started it or not. The system doesn't care who started it in the slightest.","replies":[{"poster":"CandyVanisClosed","date":"2015-11-18T01:43:25.399+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":3,"body":"Erm wrong......\nTrust me get 2 mates to repeated report you for verbal abuse....You will get chat restrictions...its been proven before....\nAs to the players not having anything done to them it just proves the point im making and Riot staff know it....\nHow many games should it be for intentionally feeding because i could give you the players stats right now and you would come back going wtf.....\nTrust me its easy to lip service but even harder to ban some 1...\nThey knew of RamRam,but like i said it took them over 1 year to do anything about him...\nWhat about the players that where called and reported let alone had some form of punishment because of him?\nThis thing of send a support ticket like ive stated before proves the system is flawed and isnt doing the job..\nAnd you seem to miss the whole point again...players get toxic when other are feeding or trolling is natural human behaviour m8....\nSo for the last part of your response no one is being toxic m8 but you can get chat restrictions for nothing its a program that responds to reports nothing more trust me....\nTake a look at the boards and see there are other threads saying the same thing.....","replies":[{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2015-11-18T02:18:08.839+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Selective evidence proves nothing. For every person that wasn't punished there were plenty more that were. But you're clearly just here to complain..in pretty much the worst way possible. If you want something done don't bitch about it. Start a real discussion. It's obvious I'm not going to change your mind, I just have faith that the majority of this community isn't gullible enough to just accept what you're saying. \n\nIt's also human nature to abandon the sick to predators but you'd be a pretty shitty person if you did that now wouldn't you? It's also human nature to deny inconvenient truths, something of which you are very guilty, but that is considered unfair bias. You are considered a good person if you can admit your faults instead of denying them, and a bad person if you can't see them or accept them. It's NURTURE that's important in human society and frankly, if you're toxic, you deserve to be punished under this system. If they're toxic so do they, but that doesn't mean you don't. Get off your high horse, if your posts are anything to go by you're at least as bad as this intent feeder you keep complaining about.\n\nIf you took a look at the boards you'd also see that especially lately, people have gone out of their way, for  no discernible gain, to post positive thank you posts on these boards. These people aren't seeking attention like the negativity, they are simply sharing their enjoyment of a damn game. You can't look at only one side of a story then expect everyone to agree with you, it's an incredibly puerile way of doing things, i.e it's the kind of thing five year olds do.","replies":[{"poster":"CandyVanisClosed","date":"2015-11-18T02:33:12.796+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":3,"body":"***","replies":[{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2015-11-18T04:27:00.837+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Well..all I can say is..it was kinda amusing..now I just kinda pity you.
