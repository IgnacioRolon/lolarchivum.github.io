It should not give him free movespeed upon hitting a minion while he has phage, or black cleaver. (To clarify, hitting a minion with an auto attack or Q will give him 20 movespeed for 6 seconds (due to bleed duration) and potentially another 60 movespeed for 2 more seconds if the bleed kills a unit.)\r\n\r\nAs someone that appreciates how powerful movespeed is in a game like League, please fix this. This is broken, even if Darius himself isn&#039;t &quot;broken op&quot; or &quot;busted&quot; at this point in time.","replies":[{"poster":"YellowBrickRoad","date":"2016-08-30T07:03:51.535+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"If you are talking about regular phage then yes you are correct.\n\nIf you are talking about black cleaver than no, black cleaver is procced when you apply physical damage to an enemy not just on autos, so it will proc on each hemorrhage tick as hemorrhage does physical damage.","replies":[{"poster":"TsunamiNinja","date":"2016-08-31T11:17:59.686+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Oh thanks for pointing that out. Maybe that changed the text on BC?
