I feel this would be better on roits part as they still help the community and then also don't make it so easy that you still have to work for that one champion you want, and the \"random\" champion being stronger than most (usually) is ment to help you learn the game and grow as you use harder and more mechanical champions before you start the beast we called ranked.\n{{sticker:slayer-pantheon-thumbs}}","replies":[]}]}
