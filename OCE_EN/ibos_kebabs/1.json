Us beta users don&#039;t even get it free. but none the less it is an amazing skin BUT sadly won&#039;t be buying it because of the fact you lied to us. \r\n\r\nPS. coming from a person who has spent $1000+ on league of legends.","replies":[{"poster":"The Mighty Smurf","date":"2015-10-01T04:10:03.729+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"My thought was exactly the same as this lol. I came here during beta to which I lost skins because there was no refer a friend when it first came up. But I too would like a refund on pool party ziggs for the server skin","replies":[]}]}
