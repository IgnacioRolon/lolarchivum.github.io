I log in to my account and everything on the client is good so far. I select a game mode and wait for a game. Once I get a game I lock in my champion and get in loading screen. Now here&#039;s where the problem starts. While in the loading screen, two things can happen:\n\n1)The loading percentage freezes between 40% to 60% then I instantly get disconnected. \nOR\n2)I load in the game without any problems\n\nIf I do load in game several things could happen. These things are:\n1)I move for a bit then I instantly freeze while everyone moves. After a while everyone freezes then I disconnect.\n2)I buy my items and select my first ability but it doesn&#039;t show that I have purchased that item or even upgraded my first ability.\n3)I move from spawn to lane then after a few seconds I instantly return to base.\n4)I randomly disconnect during team fights but then reconnect a few seconds after.\n\nNote that my ping every games ranges from 16 to 23 ms and now it ranges from 23 to 38 ms. I also have an increase in fps where I usually used to have 40 to 60 fps and now i have 60 to 75 fps. An increase in ping and fps would normally mean that I would DC during the game. \n\nThis has been happening for my past few games and it has been very annoying DC&#039;ing at least 10 times every game. I have restarted my router and reinstalled league several times but it doesn't seem to fix the problem\n\nYou can check my [OP.gg](http://oce.op.gg/summoner/userName=Sk8rL8r) and see that the games I&#039;ve lost or won has a high death count as I DC during team fights and duels. I haven&#039;t played league for the past week due to this reoccurring problem since I don&#039;t want to receive a leaverbuster for something that I believe is not my fault.\n\n[Update] So I played an intro bots game and just before I got on the loading screen, the chat box on the lower left of champ select showed that every person in the lobby had left the server except me.

Did you reset your PC network adapter? Did you pray to RNGesus?","replies":[{"poster":"Sk8rL8r","date":"2018-11-26T10:03:25.136+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yes I have reset my router and connection box and league still hasn't worked.
