Did you add a filter or something onto the actual game replay itself? \n\nCan I suggest you fix your music, make the music sync with a particular play or hypey moment. It may seem like a lot of work to edit your music and video for it to go hand in hand but it will be worth it :)\n\nLooking forward to more content!","replies":[{"poster":"KDA Player","date":"2017-05-08T12:14:13.843+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"hey :) yeah it has a color correction on, ill do my best to sync the music for next one! cheers :)","replies":[]}]}]}
