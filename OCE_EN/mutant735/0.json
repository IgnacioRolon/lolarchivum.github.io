Recently in an ARAM game, one of my friends got a penta kill then another kill soon after and I heard the announcer say \"Legendary Kill\" but again, no-one else heard it. Just to make sure I'm not crazy, I wanted to find out if anyone else has heard either of these announcements, I am most interested in the legendary kill as i can't find evidence that it still exists.","replies":[{"poster":"Mar3thyu","date":"2015-02-04T07:50:25.088+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"is norm pretty sure it happens if someone plays ashe lissandra or sejuani","replies":[{"poster":"Project Xayah","date":"2015-02-04T08:26:41.010+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Actually I think it's random.
