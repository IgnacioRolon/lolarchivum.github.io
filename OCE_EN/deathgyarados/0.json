The only requirements for progressing towards the next Honour level are that you play and stay within the rules, or as the FAQ puts it \"Just show up, don't be an asshole and you'll rise over the coming weeks and months\". Receiving Honours does (slightly) increase your progress, though.\n\nGiven the nature of the system, it does seem to be skewed more towards taking several months to climb to Honour 5, which makes sense since it's tied to the season (similarly to ranked and ranked rewards). I doubt there'd be a whole lot of people with Honour 3 (if any) yet, and if there are they'd be on OCE (since we got the Honour update 2 weeks [or, rather, one patch cycle] before other servers).","replies":[]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"EpicGameKnight","date":"2019-02-25T00:14:20.824+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Can you level up your honor by playing bot matches?","replies":[]}]}
