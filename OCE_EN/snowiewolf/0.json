I really hope that there might be some change about it i don't see how it could possibly hurt to have them and it give people more of a sense of freedom and make it cooler to join a club that has am amazing name and tag attached please help get this in the game for all alt codes to be added in use of club tags and maybe even summoner names but mostly club stags","replies":[]}
