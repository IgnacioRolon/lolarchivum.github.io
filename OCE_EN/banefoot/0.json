I&#039;d like to buy skins, but because ARAM is random I don&#039;t really want to spend money on a champ I might only play once a month.  I think it&#039;d be great if you could buy something specific to ARAM where you are given the option of one random skin every time you play.  That way I could have variety in appearance without spending a thousand dollars.\r\n\r\nI realise there are boosts, but that&#039;s a pretty expensive way to do it in the long run.\r\n\r\nWhat do you guys think?","replies":[{"poster":"Klavinmour","date":"2017-02-21T16:23:19.159+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'd much rather see ARAM actually become RANDOM first.\n\nAll champs should be unlocked in ARAM to prevent the horrible existence of ARAM Accounts that get Lux 90% of the time because it's the only champ the own.","replies":[{"poster":"JasonWazza","date":"2017-02-22T12:01:57.274+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I still don't understand why people have ARAM only accounts, seems boring to me.","replies":[{"poster":"Banefoot","date":"2017-02-23T07:16:57.460+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"It's not as big a commitment.
