He brings up that Talon is better because of duskblade{{item:3147}} but I always comeback with Void Staff{{item:3135}} and Liandry&#039;s Torment{{item:3151}} because it gives more penetration and consistent dmg while duskblade is more of one use then screwed.  Let me know what you guys think about who is better and sorry for only focusing on items as gameplay depends on the person,","replies":[{"poster":"Wean","date":"2017-08-09T06:14:08.106+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Talon's abilities deals physical damage, Katarina's abilities deals magical damage.\nTalon's damage is insane, Katarina is sometimes hard to lane against since it is not easy to predict when she would be using her abilities, and when she suddenly use it, catching her opponent unprepared, it can cause a significant amount of damage, and possibly kill her opponent.","replies":[]},{"poster":"LAKIGR","date":"2017-08-08T16:00:16.334+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"this is really simple, talon is good at killing 1 person unless he is ahead. On the other hand katarina is better at killing multiply people thanks to her reset, allowing her to just melt teams.","replies":[]}]}
