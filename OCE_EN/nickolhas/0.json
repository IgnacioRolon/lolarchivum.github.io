Other players are starting to get their purples, so let's say the game is averaging about 6-7 of each purple unit left in the pool. You sell that level 2 Kindred to get another Leona, and suddenly there are 10 Kindreds to the 6-7 of other purple units so you are more likely to see Kindred in the pool.\n\nNaturally, you'll notice this phenomenon more with higher quality units since the total number of those qualities are lower and you'll notice more when some come back into the pool.\n\nIt's a lot like counting cards in Poker. The deal is always random, but you can make a prediction on the likelihood of certain cards/suits being dealt based on what has been taken out of the deck already.","replies":[]},{"poster":"BlueBilberry","date":"2019-07-31T05:55:19.777+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Part of it is because the game seems to have moved to a tile type system for the re-rolls.
