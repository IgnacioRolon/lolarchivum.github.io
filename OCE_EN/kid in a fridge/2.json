It&#039;s really delayed, looks more like 200 ping. I&#039;m a Season 1 player and have never seen this when I was in the NA servers (Seasons 1-3). I also get this weird lag where everything freezes for 2 or more seconds, then plays all the attacks/abilities I didn&#039;t see while frozen at the same time. I get this at least 15 times a game. If there is anyway to fix these issues, It&#039;d be appreciated if you leave suggestions!\r\nCheers.","replies":[{"poster":"xGonGivItToYa","date":"2016-01-24T02:52:27.702+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I've got the exact problem, only happened when you guys released this new patch. \n\nFreakin annoying, not to mention I am literally CONSTANTLY disconnecting from the chat/pvpnet","replies":[]},{"poster":"Wuks","date":"2016-01-22T22:21:09.514+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey Hexidian,\n\nI'm sorry to hear that you're encountering connection issues to the League of Legends servers.
