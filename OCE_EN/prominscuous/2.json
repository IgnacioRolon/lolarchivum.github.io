Cause, whenever I get support, I usually buy a sightstone and I just place it wherever I go, I rarely walk to a certain spot on the map just to ward. Can someone also tell me where should I place my pinks as well and why. \r\nThank you","replies":[{"poster":"BarryButcher","date":"2016-12-18T02:16:03.774+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Early game you ward for ganks. So in River and tri-bush. Also warding drag is important.\n\nMId game if you are winning, you push you wards into the enemy jungle. Ward their buffs, ward baron etc.\nIf losing, ward your own jungle so you can walk around safely.\n\nTry to always have baron warded if its past the 25 min mark. Sometimes a sneaky {{item:2055}} in the back of the pit can last a while.\n\n\n--------------------------\n\nIf you are blue side. You usually want to \"Pink\" tri-bush. Its easy to defend the ward and gives your jungler a clear gank path.\nRed side, you want to place it in river if you are constantly pushing, or maybe even mid river so its less contested. You will find that that lower river bush is usually a battlezone and constantly cleared of pink wards.\n\nBut basically, ward where you plan to be. If you plan to take dragon, ward around  it at the enemy buff and the paths that lead to drag so you can see if the enemy is coming. same for baron.\n\nThere is a guide here: http://www.mobafire.com/league-of-legends/build/support-guide-map-control-warding-344910\n\nits pretty old but gives you a good general idea.","replies":[]}]}
