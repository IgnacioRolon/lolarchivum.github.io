I try to dodge his w but some times im trapped in his e (not stunned) which gives me little space to move about. So some tips against this guy would be great :D","replies":[{"poster":"Plasmarine","date":"2016-01-27T04:38:01.673+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"**TF vs Veigar:**\nIf I was playing TF against Veigar I would personally build him AD. Legit. He's actually a pretty good ADC and you would have countered Veigar hard by doing that.\n\nRapid Firecannon - Gives you super long ranged Gold Cards (Amazing. Great for ganks/chasing down enemies. You can also use it to poke safely with Red Card, or just a basic.)\nBlade of the Ruined King - AD TF lives for attack speed because of his E. Get 4 attacks in and you get even more of it too! Also gives life steal. Perfect item.\nBerserker Greaves - The obvious choice for boots, since you need dat attack speed. Merc treads would be the 2nd best options (Will often let you escape his E before W lands, but I still much prefer BG on him. Just because of how badly you need the attack speed.\n\nI usually finish with IE, Phantom Dancer and Youmuu's but there's a damn lot of other ways you could potentially go\nI'm unsure if Ruunan's stacks his E... If so definitely need to get that. I'll look into that!\n\n**TL;DR:** Build him AD\n\n\nIf you're scared to try something new/for a huge variety of other AP Champs you should try this: Works wonders for me on Ahri\n**General AP Champs** vs Veigar:\n\nAthene's Unholy Grail - Gives MR, AP, CDR and Mana Regen. Go this over Morello's everytime against Veigar!\nMerc Treads - Lets you escape his E before his W lands majority of the time! Also gives MR.\nAbyssal Scepter - AP + MR. Exactly what you need! Also reduces enemy MR which is nice, since he probably has an Athene's too\nZhonya's Hourglass - Sounds like an odd choice to counter Veigar since it gives Armour, but if you time it right you can Zhonya his ult (Yep, it works! May take a lot of practice though. My friend was able to do it by the end of a custom we played). Can also Zhonya off all his other abilities too (besides his stun) and gives you hefty AP, so it's pretty great. Be wary of him setting up W while you're in it though!\nSpirit Visage - *IF* and only *if* playing an AP Champ with heals E.G. Swain, Ryze, Raka, Nami, Nunu, etc.. The HP it gives works wonders with all the MR you have.\nFinish Options: Rabadon's (Probably recommend this finish since you have enough MR now to not have to worry about him really), Lich Bane's on on-hit champs, Banner of Command, Guardian's Angel. Morellonomicon if you want max CDR. You can finish however you want really. The first 3 Items are the most important!\n\n**TL;DR:** Build Grail, Merc Treads, Abyssal's and then however you want.. Zhonya's if you have mad timing skills and Spirit Visage if you have heals\n\n**Playstyle tips:**\n-Be aggressive, don't let him farm his Q!\n-Try to get the hang of when he's going to use his Q on a minion and use that opening to punish him.\n-Roam top or bot for kills\n-Ask your jungler for a gank!\n-Be wary of ganks yourself! Veigar stacks Q's even on assists now.\n\nHope some of that helps. Mained Veigar for a tiny bit and I've played against him a lot too ^^\nGood luuuck!","replies":[]},{"poster":"Essembie","date":"2016-01-27T04:34:43.332+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"http://www.championselect.net/champions/twistedfate/weak\n\nI check champion select all the time to get an idea of the counter potential of my opponent.\n\nContrary to popular belief,  counters exist and it is worth having an appreciation of this.\n\nBecause tf kit is weak vs veigar kit, you can choose to assist other lanes like ronystark said instead of fighting mid and losing.","replies":[]},{"poster":"RonyStark","date":"2016-01-27T03:07:07.531+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"as TF against veigar, you cant really do much unless you can do some hi-level play.\nUse your ult to help top/bot to feed yourself\nthen you can vs veig.\n\nmake sure you get the abyssal.\nYou need to improve MR against Veigar, unless you are way too fed.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Bambooze","date":"2016-01-26T23:49:41.340+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Try and ask for ganks early from your jungler.

He has no dashes or speed boosts so can't ever close the gap for a stun if you are positioned properly. He also cant dodge poke very easily for the same reason, and has no sustain to heal up once you do land poke on him. If you are getting bursted by him 1v1 you are positioning poorly","replies":[]},{"poster":"Lord Kylar Alice","date":"2016-01-26T09:10:53.637+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Don't move predictably, put pressure on mid to reduce his farming, if you get trapped inside his E then walk between different points so he has trouble hitting his W and Q. Playing as TF you should be able to pressure him really hard in lane with your jungler with your W. Whenever he backs away from lane try and roam and get your other lanes rolling. Outside of lane dodge his abilities and try to save Zhonya's for his ult unless you're able to eat it without risk. Abyssal Sceptre, Banshee's Veil and Merc Treads are great.","replies":[]},{"poster":"WE WUZ KINGZ","date":"2016-01-26T08:53:16.550+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"zhonya","replies":[]},{"poster":"CHEESYLEEKS","date":"2016-01-26T07:07:58.841+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"{{champion:105}}","replies":[]}]}
