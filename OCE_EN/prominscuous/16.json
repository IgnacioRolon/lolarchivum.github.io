I&#039;m in QLD, thanks","replies":[{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2016-04-16T13:03:32.381+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"AFAIK its only your final grades in Y12 compared to your year, and the other schools that count towards your OP. I live in QLD but I did the IB so I'm not too sure how the end game of the OP system works.
