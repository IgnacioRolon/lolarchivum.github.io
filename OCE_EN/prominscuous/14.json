And I still get people who don&#039;t lock in their bans, this is especially frustrating when I&#039;ve waited for quite a long time to get into champion select and then some random person decides not to read the FYI riot gave us, and chooses to pick the champion they like to ban at the last second and doesn&#039;t have enough time to lock in which results in a dodge. {{sticker:slayer-jinx-unamused}} So please to everyone lock in your bans :)","replies":[{"poster":"The White Arab","date":"2016-02-07T06:12:46.819+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"or riot just remove this lock in shit","replies":[{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2016-02-07T06:21:35.847+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It's to encourage people to engage in champion select rather than picking and then afking, which often results in a failure of communication, and the other 4 players having to try and work around someone who is unresponsive. Afking in select also drastically increases the chances of mistakes like taking the wrong summoner spells or runes/masteries. It also gives a very bad first impression to the rest of your team.\n\ntl;dr Requiring locking in is healthy for the system and team communication, what is there really to complain about?","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Bambooze","date":"2016-02-06T01:19:32.951+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I still find people doing it, even now :p","replies":[]}]}
