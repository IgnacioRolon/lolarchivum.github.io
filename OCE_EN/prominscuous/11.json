Some advice would be great :D Thanks\r\nFinal question; If I go the build path I listed above, I get approximately 1.30 Attack Speed except for when I use my E on graves but 1.30 Attack speed is kinda lame for me, I don&#039;t have specific runes for ADC so that may be part of the reason why I get this attack speed, If you wanna check my mastery you can search me on LOLKING or here&#039;s the link http://www.lolking.net/summoner/oce/358782#masteries and to see my runes http://www.lolking.net/summoner/oce/358782#runes. Is their any other build paths I should try for Graves to increase my attack speed?\r\nThanks","replies":[{"poster":"JasonWazza","date":"2015-07-02T04:40:26.072+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"First off and this isn't related to Graves, Your AP page is AP reds and Magic pen Quints, change this to either Magic pen Quints and reds, or Magic pen Reds and AP quint's your losing so much power by doing this how you are.\n\nHonestly BT for BotRK swap is dependant on who your fighting, because you want them for different things, if there is 2 or more tanks take Blade, if there is 1 tank take BT.\n\nHonestly, 1.3 AS is fine on a graves because your more of a bursty ADC then a sustained damage ADC.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Exhausted","date":"2015-07-01T23:21:47.387+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"tier 3 boots before 2 items?\n\n\nnot a good idea\n","replies":[]},{"poster":"noogai","date":"2015-07-01T23:19:14.142+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Standard build paths are dumb. Change your items up depending on the enemy champs an items. No tanks and no armor? No Whisper. No hard CC/Pick potential on their team, i.e. no blitzcranks, no threshes. no lenoa? No need for GA.\n\nI prefer to take I.E first, and then keep standard boots for a little while and get lifesteal next, preferably BORK as it lets you 1v1 and duel better. You need the sustain for your second item, boots can wait till third depending on matchup.","replies":[]}]}
