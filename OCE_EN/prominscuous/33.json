The first time was a ranked team game so I had to dodge since i couldn&#039;t do anything and I was just wasting time since I couldn&#039;t select a champion. This happened to me again today, however luckily someone else dodged for some reason. I&#039;ve also checked my internet connection and it all seems to be fine. Anyone experiencing this?","replies":[{"poster":"Omni Presents","date":"2015-12-24T09:56:12.968+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Do you ever get bugs anywhere else? Any slow internet problems?\n\nIt basically tells you that you were not able to connect to the server correctly, this means your internet crapped itself at the wrong time, or just have slow internet.","replies":[]}]}
