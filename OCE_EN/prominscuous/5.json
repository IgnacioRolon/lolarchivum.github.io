Cause I see people in Master I with like 130LP 200LP etc, and they don&#039;t seem to be in their promos like they do when you hit 100LP in Diamond,Plat,Gold,Silver or Bronze. P.S I&#039;m not Master I, I&#039;m only a Silver I player :P.\r\nThanks","replies":[{"poster":"McRuthless","date":"2015-06-23T23:13:24.044+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The LP for Master and Challenger is just a continuous ladder, and not capped to 100 LP like the other tiers. The 200 players with the most LP are Challenger and the rest are master. Theres no promo from master to challenger, you just have to get enough LP to displace someone else","replies":[]}]}
