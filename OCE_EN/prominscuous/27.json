That way you can deny troll surrender votes as well as have some A+ personal communication and banter (don't forget to ping in game though). You would even have someone by your side if things get tough. \n\nIf you haven't got any friends (or not enough so you can have someone to play at any hour of the day), you might want to [join a club](http://boards.oce.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/clubs) or take a look over on the[ team recruitment board](http://boards.oce.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/team-recruitment) :D\n\nGood luck, have fun ♥","replies":[]}]}
