Yesterday I had a game I was facing a Leblanc, during the whole laning phase all I did was stay under my turret so she couldn&#039;t get a full combo of me, that strategy went okay, but Leblanc still managed to get 2 kills from roaming and when she went back into my lane she destroyed me, Leblanc managed to get 20 Mejais stacks by around the 20 minute mark, so we lost the game.\r\nSo can someone please give me some tips on how to deal with Leblanc and what champions I should play if I face Leblanc.\r\n\r\nThanks","replies":[{"poster":"Urgot Bot","date":"2015-05-07T10:44:28.410+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"Her counter-play is praying that she disconnects and never reconnects.","replies":[]},{"poster":"mashiro sama","date":"2015-05-12T07:41:34.656+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"rush like negatron cloak then ur good to go","replies":[]},{"poster":"shalexade","date":"2015-05-08T03:25:01.175+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Step 1.

Both these champs counter the crap out of her due to their shield and it is hilarious watching her try to damage you. Just push and focus on csing whilst making sure you ward as you will be getting ganked without a doubt\n\nYou say your problem is that she harrasses you under the tower. You should never let her be in this position as it's very easy for her to punish you and it also gives her the chance to roam as she has you pushed. \n\nI personally play Malzahar against her (well...against pretty much everyone tbh) as your E and W push the lane and if she wants to farm she will get her E on her. If you have a voidling out it will absolutely destroy her. If she W's in to harrass you post 6 you just ult her and watch her die. \n\nLB sucks at farming without blue so if she has you pushed there is something wrong going on. Push her and watch her suck at csing","replies":[]},{"poster":"BarryButcher","date":"2015-05-07T06:54:35.722+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Stay out of her W range when possible.\nIf she Q's you avoid her until the mark disappears\nStay behind your minions so she can't E you.\nPush her into tower. She will have to focus on CS'ing rather than harassing you and she will lose farm since LB does poorly farming under turret. You have to take advantage of her from level 1 when she's at her weakest and you can control her for most the early game.\n\nIf you can play champs that can either avoid her damage like Zed or Fizz or champions that can lock her down when she jumps in, like Syndra, Morgana or Annie. If you get really good, Diana can interrupt LB's W with her E and then Q+R her to mess her up.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Antodara","date":"2015-05-06T23:49:10.793+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"If you can counter pick against her, and you're decent with him, take zed. He takes a huge dump on her past level 6, and a rushed brutalizer negates her seekers.\n\nBasically, you want a champ that has very high burst, with lots of mobility/juking potential, so you can avoid her E and W while being able to return almost instantly to deal your burst. AFAIK, only Zed really has this.","replies":[{"poster":"proMINscuous","date":"2015-05-07T00:05:43.095+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thank you very much!\nAny other tips in facing Leblanc will be great as well :D","replies":[]}]}]}
