(Also to help against ganks).","replies":[]},{"poster":"Soulless Reaper","date":"2016-07-07T09:56:20.996+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"If you're a really skilled Yasuo.

Hope it helps :)\n\nthats the funny part, the best yasuo's still like to take their Ignite+flash combo's, they will only ever take exhaust over ignite if they are in a losing lane, such as vs a zed or annie, as they are at a clear disadvantage without it. When vs people yasuo has a massive advantage over or \"heavily counters\" they will take ignite to help snowball. This \"ignite/exhaust\" garbage is for the people who saw a yasuo take it in a **1v1** and thought it would be practical in a 5v5 situation","replies":[{"poster":"Soulless Reaper","date":"2016-07-08T01:55:45.389+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Everyone takes Ignite and Flash cause that was the big thing to do when he first came out and still is I think is a little better.

It's because if you windwall her stun it does crap all and she just stuns you with next spell cast, so no matter what you can't avoid the 2 sec stun without her stuffing up huge.","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Knuuckles","date":"2016-07-07T00:21:03.616+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Exhaust is used if you're in a difficult all in matchup say vs a zed or katarina","replies":[]}]}
