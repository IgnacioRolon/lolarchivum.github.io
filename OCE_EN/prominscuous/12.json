Cause recently I&#039;ve been doing terrible with him. So any tips like build paths, and other tips would be awesome! I recently have this questioning in whether I go Rod Of Ages first or Lich Bane first, can someone help me out please\nEdited: Another question is how can you get the quintessence of razer speed? http://www.lolking.net/summoner/euw/52204978#runes ","replies":[{"poster":"Crunch","date":"2016-03-07T05:54:33.924+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"You can gather plenty of good Builds/Runes/Mastery suggestions for Twisted Fate by looking at a website such as [ProBuilds](http://www.probuilds.net/champions/details/TwistedFate)\n\nTF's kit has some clear pros and cons that you'll need to learn about. \n\n**Pros:\n**\n_Reliable form of Hard CC\nLong Range Waveclear\nItem Snowball from Gold Passive\nGlobal Pressure with Ultimate_\n\n**Cons:**\n_Immobile\nEasy to Burst\nLong Ultimate Cooldown\nWeak when behind in lane_\n\nEarly Laning Phase you really want to focus on last hitting. You have a passive which gives you gold over your enemy, so keep in mind that in a farm-off you will come out on top! A good thing to note is how much gold you have versus them. If youre a couple of cs ahead  (around 1200 for rod/sheen+pots/catalyst), try and push them out of lane to force them into a smaller buy, which will give you a bigger powerspike and a little more comfort in lane.\n\nIf the enemy does start shoving you in, TF has a great ability to setup ganks due to his point and click CC from the Gold card. Communicate with your jungler when you believe you have kill pressure or see the wave coming to freeze your way. Your Pick-A-Card is definitely your biggest tool in lane. When enemies are coming to last hit cycle through the cards and move up into an aggressive position. If they go for the cs you can gold card q and auto for as thunderlords proc and a good trade. If they back off you can blue card and get free mana and easier last hit. You can also poke using the red card on a minion near them, as the full damage and slow are both area of effect. Just note that when this is on cooldown you are very vulnerable.\n\nWhen level 6 you want to look for as many opportunities as you can with your ultimate. Make sure you know what summoners on the map are up (ask if you need to!) so that your gank WILL COUNT! This is very important due to the long cooldown of Twisted Fates ultimate. ALWAYS try and secure the easiest kill to guarantee you come out of it with something. Push the mid wave and try to have it so you will have your stacked deck ready as well. Roam down (typically better as you may double kill) or up (2v1 is a safe situation to snowball your top) and keep checking your range on the ultimate. Ping to your team you are on your way and start selecting a card. tap your ultimate once, select the gold card as you check the map for any possible counterganks and then engage in (typically from a flanking position) so that it will force them back into your team. \nNote: Remember you are quite vulnerable. So respect that if you go too deep you may die before your team is able to help!\n\nHis waveclear and general range of spells while laning helps in a lot of matchups. Your RED (W) Pick-A-Card, along with Wild Cards (Q) will be able to help you shove lanes fast in order to avoid being poked in lane or engaged on (due to the enemy gaining significant minion aggro). To clear a full wave with this you'll usually need level 9 and a moderate amount of AP~(100+)\n\nAgainst assassins you will have to try and force them to push the wave into you. Most of them are melee based, which means you can hold the ranged minions of the wave from hitting the turret and they generally will not be able to stop you. From here communicate to the jungler that they are overextended and you think you can kill. You can run Teleport for safety in lane (never getting too significantly low) as well as a way to get back to mid after an ultimate roam. Ignite works well on him when you believe you have good kill pressure on your lane or need it to help secure the ganks with your ultimate. Ghost is more for higher level players typically, but is a great way to initiate, kite and chase down kills without blowing the cooldown of flash. This helps to supplement your lack of mobility, at the sacrifice of damage or utility.\n\nTF is very weak if he falls behind in a lane where he is getting heavily pressured in. Assassins and burst mages can easily take advantage of you having no flash or decent defensive stats. build some early defensive stats to stop the enemy snowballing. You can easily secure kills across the map, so a priority is not letting yourself lose lane hard so you can create more opportunities without being punished.\n\nTF was one of my first mid laners I learnt and played a lot from silver-plat. He teaches you a LOT about the game in general and is a great champ to pickup. Good   luck and have fun!","replies":[]},{"poster":"Talon12","date":"2016-03-06T05:23:25.459+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Don't Worry 80% of players suck balls at him too.\n\nGetting lucidity and sheen early really spikes him in an ap build. \n\nlevel as w/q/e/q/q/r/q/w/q/w/r/w/w/e/e/r/e/e when playing ap, level as w/e/q/e/w/r/e/e/w/e/r/w/w/q/q/r/q/q when doing onhit effect\n\nPersonally, I like to get {{item:3165}} {{item:3285}} {{item:3158}} {{item:3094}} {{item:3157}} {{item:3100}}  and the 5% cdr mastery, just because perma stun is fun, it also adds some survivability, works best when they have a squishy or short range team(thunder lords + cdr mastery). If i really need to carry though (or super tank), {{item:3001}} {{item:3100}} {{item:3135}} {{item:3285}} {{item:3020}} {{item:3089}} you can swap void staff out if the ydont have any mr on their team and replace it with {{item:3157}}. 1st build is survivability/poke 2nd is an invitation onto the rape train(thunderlords + the armor pen mastery).

RFC is actually really really good on him, even with ap. That \"ap build with rfc\" is a poke and whittle build, it also allows you to catch people out of position extremely well, rfc can also save your life because of it range buff. The rfc range buff really makes tf aids to fight against, because he can innitiate a 2 sec stun on people out of place, which will usually give your team an advantage because of the free kill. Its a 3  sec cd 2 sec stun with a massive range, it may not seem orthodox, but sometimes the best things arent.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Bambooze","date":"2016-03-06T00:47:02.051+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Well, if you're ahead, go Lich Bane for more burst, otherwise go ROA if you want. You just gotta manage your cards well in teamfights and stuff. A useful tip incase you didn't know is that when you activate Pick a Card, the HUD symbol changes card (colour) based on what card is able to be chosen in that second or so. It can be really useful when you're ulting somewhere, and you don't need to look at your champion to tell which card to choose. :)","replies":[{"poster":"Manyula","date":"2016-03-06T05:35:06.337+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"dont listen to this guy, build defensively always, altho not necessarily ROA. go abyssal vs most ap mids, roa against assassins, seekers vs zed/yas+AD that can stick to you.
