If you can't shrug off someone saying gg ez then you shouldn't be playing games.\n\nhere's a fact. the world is full of assholes. everyone is an asshole. no matter where you go, what you do, you will meet assholes. trying to protect yourself from assholes is futile. there will always be assholes. the best thing you can do is ignore it have it not affect you.","replies":[{"poster":"fattyhotdogs","date":"2016-04-01T05:43:45.048+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yes mate, I played sport for 13 years. While I was obviously always on the winning side, you know what we did after a game? We shook hands and said 'good game' or 'well done mate' or something of good nature like that.
