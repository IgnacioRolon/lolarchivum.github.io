The only constraint we face is the ping, unfortunately for Oceania we get around 300-400 ping which is not possible to play with.A friend introduced garena and in garena servers we get around 60 ping which is more than perfect for us and all of us here know that if we want to improve as a county and go to the next level we need to move to garena servers and participate in Asain tournaments.But then again most of hesitate to do because they dont want to loose their accounts which they have made putting lot of money and hard work.To get to level 30 and have at least some rune pages and runes, own the favorite champs and not to forget to buy the skins they want it will take more than one year and a lot of money.If it is made possible that there is a transfer option from Oceania to Garena all of us with our hard felt gratitude will move with the blink of an eye even though it cost 2600 rp. Since this is not available we see a trend i.e most of us here are frustrated and quitting league joining dota 2 and i personally dont want to leave league because i love the game too much and also hate to see this happening.So i want to know can Riot arrange something like transfer option to garena?\nIt will be greatly beneficial. Thnx.","replies":[{"poster":"Sephyre3","date":"2015-09-17T01:03:36.778+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey dude,\n\nUnfortunately transfers to Garena is not something we're likely to be able to offer anytime soon. We've only ever done one transfer and that was from Garena to Oceania and that was a one off. It's a very manual process because Garena is different to say NA, which is a Riot region.\n\nAs much as it sux your best bet is to start a new account on Garena. We're not likely to open transfers from Oceania TO Garena - it's not something we're actively planning for.","replies":[{"poster":"Knightmare9878","date":"2015-09-17T16:07:05.522+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thnx for the answer Sephyre ...

Additionally Riot Games does not actually operate the servers located there, they are subcontracted, so obtaining a manual transfer through Player Support is also not an option.\n\nThe only option is to create an account on the Garena servers. While I normally wouldn't recommend this Riot hasn't provided a valid alternative; perhaps buying an account would relieve some of the annoyance of having to grind to level 30 again.","replies":[{"poster":"Knightmare9878","date":"2015-09-17T16:08:26.728+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Is there any thing i can do to reduce the ping spikes.... it suxs to be lagging at the time of loading up a match and the gameplay ... and i have a decent wifi setup....\nthnx","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Talon12","date":"2015-09-16T22:38:54.492+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Dota2...\n\nHave you seen the clarity in that game >.< I just couldn't play it","replies":[]}]}
