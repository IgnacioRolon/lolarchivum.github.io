So having 1 available refund left, I thought the logical thing to do was to refund zed and buy the Champion with the ip refunded. However - to my surprise - I am unable to refund the purchase. Next to zed splash art there is text stating that zed is &#039;not refundable.&#039;\r\n\r\n3 days after the zed purchase I bought the Champion {{champion:11}}, however I am able to refund this purchase.\r\n\r\n_Thoughts_\r\n\r\n* Maybe I waited too long and am unable to refund because of the 4 days in between purchase and wanting to refund\r\n\r\n* Could be that I (on the same day as the purchase) opened a premium loot crate and unlocked the skin &#039;shockblade Zed&#039; and can&#039;t refund zed because I have unlocked the skin permanently.\r\nThose are the only things I can think of.\r\n\r\nPlease help, anything will be appreciated!","replies":[{"poster":"Tele","date":"2017-07-02T00:19:04.629+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yeah, you're on the right track with your second thought.
