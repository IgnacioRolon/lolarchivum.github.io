{"poster":"Nexionz","date":"2017-02-22T06:12:53.522+0000","title":"It's probably just me.","subforum":"Gameplay & Strategy","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"I don&#039;t post often here, but when I do, It&#039;s mostly always with the best intent. I&#039;m sure riot agrees I&#039;m a bit of a pester. However, a while ago I was emailed a survey to take from rito. It brought up the topic of Taric and his kit. I thought to myself &quot;Man, when Taric&#039;s new kit came out he looked so nice.&quot; and admit ably just looking at his kit, it seems really cool. I got back into him when they brought him back into my sights, I&#039;d like to get better with him really. Maybe it&#039;s just me....but does he seem a bit underwhelming? I&#039;ve tried a few things, different builds, different runes, masteries, adc&#039;s, top lane, summoner spells, straight tank, straight AP, mixing both. I still don&#039;t feel comfortable enough to even bother with him in pvp. I think, don&#039;t shoot me here, but It&#039;s his healing that is very underwhelming. At all three stacks you get a 60% bonus based off Ap. This bonus goes hand in hand with Soraka&#039;s own heal (The only other healing champion)  but even she has a Higher base healing power.... I find this troubling. Soraka can heal (For a greater amount), cast silence (which then leads to a stun), and deal damage while healing herself all while staying happily close to her adc. Taric over here is trying to land a stun that is easy to see, has a pretty decently long cast time, has to leave the side of his adc either to get poked at and whittled down fairly easy no matter how you build him, and heal himself with a heal that is very underwhelming at any level with any amount of stacks. If I where to continue my contrast with soraka, Yea, she&#039;s got abilities with one heck of a tell, but at least they are all ranged. Damage wise aswell, Id go with raka any day of the week. That being said, Taric has some semblance of front line presence. Some amount of tankiness. I use some very heavily here. He still gets eaten alive. I could careless if he did dmg. Its the healing part I&#039;m here for... If he&#039;s going to do no dmg, he should be tanky. If he&#039;s going to be tanky, he shouldn&#039;t fall apart after being cc&#039;d. If he&#039;s going to fall apart after being cc&#039;d he should be able to heal more than the absolutely pathetic amount he does.\r\nLastly, His Ultimate. Omg his ultimate. Drawing the comparison to keep up appearances Raka. Global heal, pretty decent heal at that. Instant cast. Pretty effective for helping your teammate from biting the dust from an opponent who doesn&#039;t expect a Raka ulty from bot lane.....Then we have taric. What even is this ultimate.... It is truly truly truly Outrageous. The cast time, the tell, the effect duration of the ultimate. Nothing screams louder than a taric ulty what the enemy teams intention is. The only time this comes in handy is team fights, given that, you&#039;d have to have everyone go in with full health, cast, and run the risk of killing the squishier people in your party, if not yourself. Then, the duration of this ultimate is the same as the cast time.... for an ultimate, it&#039;s effect is good, but not even close to good enough for the requirements of the ulty. From cast time, to getting the proper situation, to effectiveness, It really just doesn&#039;t add up to be anything Great. Just moderately mediocre. Which is how I would describe Taric overall at this point.\r\n\r\nNow then.... If anyone has a good build or point to make to me, please do, I&#039;d love for someone to show me a Taric build that doesn&#039;t feel so underwhelming.  Maybe it&#039;s all in my head. Maybe I&#039;m just awful. Idk. Just plx. anyone.\r\n\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n{{champion:86}} {{summoner:4}} {{summoner:12}}","replies":[{"poster":"FatedSaviour","date":"2017-02-22T06:24:59.721+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"tldr\nwell i read some of it, and 2 things\n1, NAMI IS A HEALER, SONA IS A HEALER, THERE ARE MORE THAN 2 HEALERS\n2, taric is meant to be an ap tank, soraka is meant to have more heals cuz tarics hard cc is easier to get off, as well as the bonus armour to ally champs, the sheild, the invincibility, dont compare taric to soraka, thats like comparing tristanna to zilean","replies":[{"poster":"Nexionz","date":"2017-11-30T22:19:28.898+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Cool. He's meant to tank. Make him a tank then. Don't give him a heal that will do nothing, if you don't build anything but HP and AP.
