Lulu and Lux are having some cupcakes that they made together the previous day, Janna is drinking tea whilst trying to calm Jinx down who is currently chasing Poppy for trying to take a spoonful of her curry. The team goes about their day as per usual not expecting anything to happen.\r\n\r\nBut once school finishes they get alerted that there&rsquo;s trouble happening at Kumungu. The star guardians are called to the location and are having trouble finding the enemy, although there is evidence of a potential threat having been there they don&rsquo;t see the monster itself. Jinx starts to get impatient and tells the group that there&rsquo;s nothing wrong and that they should just go. Janna being the eldest has experienced a situation just like this and decides that they will take a closer look inside the jungle, the team agrees but Jinx is starting to get annoyed at the group. Lux and Janna both look at each other feeling an evil presence and nodding in agreement that there is definitely something here. Lulu and Poppy are distracted by trying to get Jinx to chill out because at this stage she is extremely annoyed by the group and doesn&rsquo;t think there is any danger at all. Unaware of what&rsquo;s about to happen Jinx decides to walk off and leave the group. Janna orders Lulu (who&rsquo;s the closest of the group with Jinx) to try and get her to come back.\r\n\r\nOnce Lulu and Jinx disappear out of sight a small purple creature jumps out of a nearby bush at Janna her reflexes kick in and she knocks the creature away, the creature starts crying and a colossal shadow appears from behind the guardians. Poppy, Lux and Janna look behind themselves and see a gigantic creature that looks exactly like the thing that tried to attack Janna. The guardians prepare to engage in a battle with the foe but out of nowhere a spear gets thrown from the dense jungle. Whilst the creature is distracted the guardians prepare to attack. \r\nJanna sends a tornado flying at the creature, Poppy charges into it knocking it in into a tree and lux sends her binding from afar. The creature falls to the ground only to get back up again. A deafening screech comes from the creature and it jumps an immense distance into the air and strikes downward to the ground knocking all the guardians back. Lux and Janna struggle to get back up but Poppy charges right for the creature. &ldquo;Poppy no wait!&rdquo; screamed Janna. Poppy got thrown into a nearby tree, extremely injured she tries standing up but collapses. A green aura surrounds Poppy and her injuries start to fade away &nbsp;the confused guardians decide to retreat and make a plan. \r\n\r\n&ldquo;We need to wait for Jinx and Lulu to get back before we can actually take that thing down&rdquo; explained Lux. \r\n&ldquo;Yes, but we don&rsquo;t know when or if they will come back&rdquo; Poppy said. \r\n&ldquo;They will I trust Lulu to bring Jinx back we just have to stall without them&rdquo; Janna said. \r\n&ldquo;I can help with that&rdquo; says an enchanting feline voice. \r\nThe guardians turn around to see a slim character standing before them.\r\n&ldquo;Who are you exactly?&rdquo; Lux asked. \r\n&ldquo;My name is Nidalee and I want to help defeat this beast, it has been destroying the place I call home and killing many of the wildlife here. Will you help me defeat this thing? Nidalee asked. \r\n&ldquo;We need to stall for the rest of our team to come back, we are expecting their arrival soon.&rdquo; Janna assured Nidalee. \r\n&ldquo;I shall distract it while you try and defeat the thing I have managed to find out that it has a weak point on it&rsquo;s back when the eye opens, that is when you must strike it, it will take a lot of power but I believe you can do it.\r\nNidalee jumps out of the forest into the view of the creature and transforms into a cougar and baits the beast away from the guardians.\r\n\r\nThe three guardians all nod at each other sensing the arrival of their teammates. Lulu and Jinx are seen flying into view. The two land in front of the guardians and Lulu starts to explain what happened. \r\n&ldquo;No time for that Lulu we must engage battle with this creature, you will know when to attack it trust me, we must hurry before Nidalee gets hurt&rdquo; Janna explained. The group then goes to find the creature currently tailing Nidalee. There are spears all around the forest and claw marks in all the trees, Nidalee then falls to the ground and as the creature was drawing its arms back to take a final swing at Nidalee an eye on it&rsquo;s back opens and the guardians all know what to do. Nidalee slowly opens her eyes to see Lulu and Janna standing before her. &ldquo;She&rsquo;s awake!&rdquo; Lulu screams with excitement. Lux then offers Nidalee her hand and says &ldquo;The first star has offered you a place on our team, we really do think you would fit in well&rdquo;\r\n&ldquo;I guess I owe you guys for saving my home, sure i&rsquo;ll join you.&rdquo; Nidalee then grabs Lux&rsquo;s hand and a bright orange light falls upon &nbsp;Nidalee, a blinding flash engulfs the area and the guardians see Nidalee&rsquo;s new form.\r\n{{champion:76}}","replies":[{"poster":"ReportMeFeeding","date":"2017-09-15T05:03:18.035+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thanks for taking the time to read my fan fic (if you did) Any feedback is great I would love to hear what I did good and what I did bad.","replies":[]}]}
