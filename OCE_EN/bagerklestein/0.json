Just had a massive aram lag out (got booted out 3 times)\r\n\r\nDuring this game, ping 28-30ms, while the game was borked I closed lol, rand a quick speed and ping test, 20mbit down, 800kbit up and a 27ms ping to Sydney (I&#039;m in Canberra)\r\n\r\nthis has been happening for about 2 weeks, I&#039;ve spoken to support who&#039;ve got me jumping through all the test hoops and passing.\r\n\r\nI&#039;ve seen multiple people in game experiencing what I am experiencing, these people usually have better hardware than me too.\r\n\r\nWhat&#039;s going on ?\r\n\r\nLiterally nothing changed for me except when 6.20 came out, I start randomly lagging.\r\n\r\nSince I&#039;m evidently not the only one, I&#039;d like to know if anyone has any insight. FTR I as not running anything else (no p2p, streaming, casting, voip) and no one else in on the dsl service, so it&#039;s not some sneaky app sucking the bandwidth out of the connection.","replies":[{"poster":"SephirothSG","date":"2016-10-31T09:03:25.668+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey there,\n\nCould you do the following for me;\n\n* [Download WinMTR](https://sourceforge.net/projects/winmtr/files/WinMTR-v092.zip/download) and run a traceroute to the following IP.

This is quite high, and you may experience substantial disruption to your       network performance when performing interactive tasks such as web-surfing while simultaneously conducting large uploads. With such a buffer, real-time applications such as games or audio chat can work quite poorly when conducting large uploads at the same time.\nWe estimate your downlink as having 290 ms of buffering.
