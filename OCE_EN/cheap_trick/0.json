These are now much harder to read for no real reason, from 100 HUD size to 1 HUD size the small font still scales to be small compared to the other UI elements like the frames.\r\n\r\nIs this intentional? Will there be an option to revert to the old font size thats easier to read? Im failing to see the reason why you would intentionally make your fonts smaller and increase the strain on player eyes while the rest of the HUD remains the exact same size.","replies":[{"poster":"Gehirn","date":"2018-10-10T02:03:41.161+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hi Cheap Trick,\n\nThanks for reporting this.

I have hated this change so much the number of times I go into fights thinking I have my ult when really I don't because the dam timer is SO SMALL!!! there has to be a way to change this right? Edit a text file maybe?","replies":[{"poster":"Gehirn","date":"2019-08-13T04:02:14.613+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"What timer are you referring to? Because the champion ability UI scales with HUD size, and the ability is greyed out when it's not yet active.\nCan you point out in a screenshot the element that you have issues with?","replies":[]}]}]}]}
