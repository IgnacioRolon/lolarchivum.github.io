Anyone else experiencing this? Or do you just avoid midnight games just because of this?","replies":[{"poster":"Frosted","date":"2016-05-01T00:42:26.002+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I've been encountering this. I've played a few games around that time due to \"one more game\" kinda circumstances and there is always these people. For me, it's been Koreans as everyone else on my team had #KOR. on their clan tag and asked me if I spoke Korean. Since their symbols aren't on the English client, all I got was a spam of those annoying white boxes the entire game. Whenever I asked them to speak english, they said things like \"No C*nt\" and all sorts, meaning they could but chose not to for some reason. When the game ended, the whole enemy team was writing boxes in the After Game screen as well... So rip au players.","replies":[]},{"poster":"icefire009","date":"2016-05-01T04:23:09.685+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Whats wrong with that?
