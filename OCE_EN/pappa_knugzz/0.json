A bit about me, I&#039;ve been playing League since Season 2 casually with friends and by myself, and have loved the game since I first downloaded it. What really hooked me was the lore. The stories of the champions, the interactions between champions, and most importantly the reason as to why they fight on Summoner&#039;s Rift. It painted such a colorful world, told such interesting stories and had limitless potential for expanding upon. Events like the Freljord re-design was amazing, and brought together champions in to more tight-knit stories and made allegiances and enemies more outlined.\r\n\r\nThen the stories stopped, and the details behind the champions was reduced and what we were left with was a champion insight and a paragraph of lore in-game.  Why? I know Riot wants to redesign a lot of the lore as they themselves said that, but they said that back in like Season 3 and still barely anything has changed. Why? The lore is so important to people, at least to me. I love fantasy, I love written works of art, and there has been a distinct lack of it in the last few years. Why?\r\n\r\nRiot is a business, and the turnover is the main concern for most in head office. I understand that. But lore turns a game into a world and creates immersion. Immersion in a game is, in my opinion, the most important aspect of a game. I want to feel like I am the one fighting, not just pressing keys on a keyboard.\r\n\r\nMy next talking point is about the amount of champions who are &#039;viable&#039; in a certain meta. We have over 130 champions and yet only a handful are played at any given time. Sure the meta changes and certain champions fall in and out of favor, but it still remains that there is around 15 - 20 champions out of all of them you should pick because they are just better. I know balance is the most critical point to any MOBA, and with so many champions it is a monumental task to balance every champion within their own strengths and weaknesses, and some champs are designed to fit a specific role and team composition, but there are so many champions out there who are supposed to fit niche roles to a T and are left in the dust (Case in point: Maokai over Trundle when a tank is required, or Azir over Malzahar for a wave clearing pusher mage).\r\n\r\nMaybe it&#039;s time to put new champions on the shelf and visit the older champions who need love in terms of redesigns, overhauls or minor kit tweaks to see more game time. I know people will play what they like, but play a normal and count the amount of obscure champions that get played, it&#039;s quite few. Should Riot, now with 130 odd champions released, slow it down and start balancing what they have and get it right before introducing even more champions to the mix, creating an ever more chaotic scene?\r\n\r\nShare your thoughts and ideas here, this is meant to be a discussion and I really would love to hear what you all think in regards to this. Thanks for bearing with me and reading it!","replies":[{"poster":"Maraudaur","date":"2015-07-07T06:19:47.635+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey man,\n\nI'm not an expert on either of those topics (Lore/Game balance) but I can provide some insight about what has happened in Lore.\n\n**Lore**\nIts great to see you're interested in the Lore behind our world.

My question was mainly why is it taking so long for the lore to be meshed out, why can't we be provided with more updates in regards to it? Why are things such as Mastery and Chroma packs being released in priority over having the lore cemented into a place of time, why are champions being released in streams when existing champions sit on a back burner and get minor tweaks without much depth or explanation? Why is the game solely balanced around what is played in the LCS rather than the solo queue, which takes a vast majority of game time?\n\nI understand you aren't an expert on this, and I don't mean to come off rude or anything, but the back and forth has almost been non-existant as to why champions keep being released instead of fixing existing ones and why lore is only a paragraph instead of making the lore and current champion pool the main priority of your time investment, seeing as how it is the core principle of the game itself?","replies":[{"poster":"Maraudaur","date":"2015-07-07T07:21:06.621+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'll try and get some information for you around the game balance/gameplay side of questions. \n\n> My question was mainly why is it taking so long for the lore to be meshed out, why can't we be provided with more updates in regards to it?\n\nI cant answer that one right now but I will see if I can find out more on that for you.

I completely understand that a compelling story and l should know this, I write myself and I like to think I do it well. I guess just as it's my passion being left in the dark annoyed me when in reality I wasn't left in the dark I was just impatient. I'd love to get behind the scenes and pick the brains of the Narrative team, hell I'd love to be a part of it, the creation of a land creating the stories for it has always been a passion of mine. The fact that the team is going back and making sure everything is perfect is amazing, I guess I just need to be patient and wait for it, even though I would love to be on the team writing.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Suffocator","date":"2015-07-07T06:59:00.616+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"How do you feel about Ekko and his place in the lore?","replies":[{"poster":"Pappa Knugzz","date":"2015-07-07T07:02:15.718+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"All I personally know about him is he is a teenage boy who built a time manipulation device, he is from Zaun, apparently a street kid, I know nothing of his family or why he's a street kid.

I honestly think it's just talking about the Bilgewater event but you never know. I understand they are writing the world basically from scratch again and have done a great job thus far, but champs like Ekko and even Tahm Kench have no pivotal role explained as to why they even are here. There needs to be a driving force as to why they are on the Rift, not just 'Oh hey, this guy was found, control him'.\n\nThis is coming from someone who loves Ekko and hyped for Tahm, but lore-wise I couldn't care less about them.","replies":[{"poster":"Maraudaur","date":"2015-07-08T00:05:05.187+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I think one of the main points about the Lore revamp was to move away from explaining why they are fighting on the rift as that was very restrictive.\n\nThey wanted stories to be standalone in the world of Runeterra.

The game may as well be renamed as if there is no explanation or intention to fight then there is no need for the League of Legends to even exist, and as such the Wars and alliances formed are purely based on the characters without any outside interference. Why are we able to play as them and why are they always fighting on the same landscape and why is it called Summoner's Rift? Questions like this need answers and the original story was very well done. The retcon so far has removed the League of Legends institution completely, so what's the point of us as players? I know I know, it's a game, it's for fun, just play blah blah etc. But there are always going to be people questioning this.","replies":[{"poster":"Maraudaur","date":"2015-07-08T04:08:01.371+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> In the early days of League, we created a fictional background that would justify how players could control champions during games. We came up with concepts like Summoners, Fields of Justice, an Institute of War, and indeed, the League of Legends itself – all in an attempt to provide fictional context for in-game action.\n\n> After a while, these early choices began to create unexpected problems. Every new champion needed a reason to join and remain in the League, and as their number grew, the net result was that over time the world started to feel, well, small, and eventually less interesting. The institutions we’d designed fostered creative stagnation, limiting the ways that champions, factions and Runeterra itself could grow and change. Furthermore, the very idea of all-powerful Summoners made Champions little more than puppets manipulated by godlike powers. The background we’d created to explain in-game action was ultimately restricting the potential narrative development of the game’s defining characters.\n\nI know this might not be shared by all players but personally I would prefer to have a rich universe of lore not restricted by \"why they are in league of legends\". Then having a game where I can play those characters with extensive backgrounds and great lore etc etc.\n\nA quick example is Ashe;\n\nOld Lore \n\n> Ashe originally came to the Institute of War in service of the League summoners, seeking enough influence and favor to finally bring peace to her realm - one that has endured civil strife since Avarosa and the Time of the Three Sisters. With countless victories under her belt, she has started to put the influence she has earned in the League to use. Rumors abound that Ashe has begun to associate herself with fellow champion Tryndamere outside of the Fields of Justice. While she denies such talk as frivolous, all eyes will remain on Ashe now that her success in the League may finally allow her to restore lasting peace to her people.\n> \n> \"It's a good idea to spread out. Ashe can hit five birds with one arrow.\"\n> ―  Tryndamere\n\n[New Lore](http://gameinfo.oce.leagueoflegends.com/en/game-info/champions/ashe/#champion-lore)\nThe new lore IMO has much more depth and makes Ashe feel a lot more powerful. Instead of a champion that has come to the \"Institute of War\" to earn influence and favour of greater beings (summoners) for help. She is now a true hero in her own right fighting her own battles in her own way with her own beliefs. The whole Freljord region is in the hands of the 3 sisters (Ashe, Sej, Liss) and not up to how much \"influence\" each champion can get with the Institute of war.\n\nIn saying that I know it has been a slow process! I love lore too and I feel the pain. But in time the world of Runeterra will have deep and rich story in every region.....what a time it will be.
