Once I won I was expecting to get a nice chuck of LP to get me into my promos except I was disappointed when I only received 18 LP for the win. I thought this was strange because when I play and win against players equal to my rank I can normally pull 23-27LP per win. \r\n\r\nI was just wondering if anybody could explain to me why I gain less LP for winning against higher ranked players. Thanks in advance :)","replies":[]}
