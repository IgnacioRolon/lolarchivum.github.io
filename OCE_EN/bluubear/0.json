I read what was on the Riots Contact - Company it says:\n>  We&#039;re stoked you&#039;re interested in doing a project on a subject involving League of Legends or Riot Games, but the quantity of requests has totally overwhelmed us! Many of the questions that we&#039;ve seen come in are things that can be found with diligent internet searches, and the stuff that can&#039;t be found via internet search is private/proprietary and can&#039;t be shared anyway. We do have a limited opportunity to work with PhD students -- if that&#039;s you, please let us know.   \n\nI then went, \"well ok that&#039;s a no {{item:3070}} \" and then continued to move on to other sites and it&#039;s either me being absolutely blind or I just didn&#039;t look hard enough but I went onto Ubisoft, Blizzard Entertainment and came out with being puzzled. I couldn&#039;t find any relevant emails for asking about Work Experience so I went back through Riots site and re-read the Riots Contact - Company and went...., \"Well...  this isn&#039;t a school project that a subject requires me to do but rather work experience...\"\n\nSo I&#039;m posting here hoping to get some suggestions from you guys on whether I should contact and how I should even contact them because I&#039;m kind of clueless how to.","replies":[{"poster":"HORSE OF FORCE","date":"2015-05-19T04:17:47.528+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I just did work experience at my local grocery store, lol.\n\nWhat you've done so far has gathered you a lot of the crucial information that you'll need, that is, they aren't exactly looking for an inexperienced rookie looking for work experience. It's disheartening, but it also means that you have a clear goal now if you ever want to actually join Riot in what they do. I suggest you try and get work experience with a lesser known company, one that's starting out, like the Indy scene. They'll most likely be glad to be getting unpaid help from a stranger looking for purely experience, though you should probably ask one that isn't too busy with their players.\n\nAlso, for Riot, there might still be hope. Have you tried posting the request on the [Miscellaneous boards](http://boards.oce.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/miscellaneous)? You might just get lucky and have a red see it.\n\nBest of luck.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Snakes","date":"2015-05-18T12:38:58.946+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Unrelated to work experience at Riot, but I did work experience with the Police force, Fire brigade and Animal logic (a 3D art film company, dudes who made the Lego movie & happy feet + more) - all 3 were incredibly fun and insightful. I simply suggest trying to find work experience in something you can see yourself doing for work one day. \n\nI'm a 3D character artist and doing work experience at Animal Logic really helped me understand the gravity of the 3D art + general art world. \n\nGood luck!","replies":[]}]}
