If you click on an enemy out of range, you move into range and start attacking. If you click on an enemy who is in range, *you attack them*.\r\nWith Kalista's Martial Poise: If you want to move somewhere, you click on the ground. If you click on an enemy out of range, you move into range and start attacking. If you click on an enemy who is in range, *you dash towards them*.\r\n\r\nThis is a bad thing. It would still be possible to attack and dash towards an enemy, but it would no longer be possible to do so by accident just by trying to autoattack them.","replies":[{"poster":"Warau","date":"2014-12-01T00:40:56.638+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Her passive is like a free flash.

Martial Poise makes the timing for this much more finicky, because the command for \"attack this target\" is the same as the command for \"dash towards this target\".\n\nAs I said, there would be nothing stopping you using Martial Poise the same way you do now to pursue an enemy - all you would need to do is click on the ground near the enemy instead of clicking on the enemy, the same way you would for any other champion.","replies":[{"poster":"JasonWazza","date":"2014-11-30T09:52:09.008+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"If you always use the passive, then it's not a problem {{summoner:13}}","replies":[{"poster":"ForPortal","date":"2014-11-30T09:55:45.044+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Always using the passive *is* the problem.
