To restart the game you have to close the program and start it again, but that is one of the things that I will be implementing as development progresses.","replies":[{"poster":"ForPortal","date":"2015-03-27T14:18:36.834+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I have uploaded a new version of the game, which can be found here:\n\nhttp://s000.tinyupload.com/index.php?file_id=82403953347891177916","replies":[]},{"poster":"ForPortal","date":"2015-03-26T19:32:58.514+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Progress continues.
