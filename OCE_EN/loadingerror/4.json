Your mid was doing their re-placements and was actually silver last season so still has the same mmr. ** (they weren't duo with someone)\n\nNew players have a silver MMR to begin with, so those who are worth will have an easier time to get placed in a higher division (one that they deserve) instead of having to try and carry a bronze five game. MMR adjustments are heavy in the first couple of games, so those who aren't worthy get dropped to bronze level and don't impact on silver games as much.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Klavinmour","date":"2015-03-27T02:48:07.982+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"But what if we don't want to be placed in Bronze?\nI've done two of my placements.
