If we only have a limited number of refunds and cant use them on EVERYTHING then why do we have a limit on such a thing? It would make sense if we had a limit on Mystery chests but as i see it if we are unhappy with the Skin we should be allowed to refund it within 5-7 days of purchase and have to use our token after that grace period. The fact we have a limited number tells us you don&#039;t care about your customers and its tough titties to those who run out. No matter what you still have our money, whats it matter if we refund skins whenever and wherever we want. I&#039;m sure you want us to buy ALL the skins but that&#039;s why a grace period should be given. it gives us the time we need to to determine if we want a refund and you get the assurance you need to sell more skins.","replies":[{"poster":"treeNoises","date":"2015-10-02T01:57:50.136+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I don't think this should apply to mystery chests, that would just take away most of the fun of them. But for like, champion purchases I think this could work, having to wait up to months for a champion you want to learn to be on free week is pretty obnoxious and having it that you can purchase a champ and the refund it within, say, a week would be so much more forgiving to new players. Even if it was only for IP purchases, so like that RITO doesn't end up losing out on the RP purchases. Also they could make it that each week you get 1 more refund, so you can accumulate refunds up to a stack (say 4), like that you can build up an IP bank, then buy a champ, if you like it, you keep it, if you play a couple games with them and find out you hate them then you can refund with one of your refunds and buy a different one (up to four times a week). This could tie in with free week, so you try out a champ that free that week and like it, so you buy it with IP, then you realize it doesn't fit your play style (after having played them for 2 weeks) and refund it. Plus the fact that buying runes also uses IP and NOT RP, this would help players build up and conserve an IP bank without grinding for hours just to buy a champ/runes.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Æ’amous","date":"2015-10-02T01:36:51.832+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"The purpose of a mystery chest is the fact it's a mystery chest. If you're looking for a good skin you're better off going and buying that specific skin from the store, instead of taking a 1:100000000 chance you're actually going to get the skin you want. It's the risk you take when you purchase things like that. I don't think they're going to change the system either. At the start they explicitly told everyone they'd get 3 refunds max, but have since added a grace period which I think is fair.","replies":[{"poster":"Angry07","date":"2015-10-02T06:08:39.363+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You've only taken one part and have missed the purpose of this argument however what you say makes sense. The 3 limit refund is just silly full stop, imagine going into EB games and they turned around and said hey you only get to return 3 games and that's it, i cant sell you anything unless you scan your membership card and i cant refund it unless i mark it down. also in regards to what they have said in the beginning everything changes over time. As i can see your fine and don't care and in this case doesn't concern you as its not a problem you share. The message i was saying is simply we have 3 limited refunds why cant we use them on anything we want. What is the purpose of limiting our refunds when they already have our money??","replies":[]}]}]}
