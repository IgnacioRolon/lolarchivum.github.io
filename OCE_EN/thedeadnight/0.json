I was 3-3 before today and I decided to give it a go. Lost my first two games (sadly), then won the next two (yay!). I had snapchat open and ready so I could send a video of me getting my rank. I thought going 5-5 and positive in 8(ish) games , I would get into silver. No. I was placed in bronze four. I am quite mad about this because last season I won 3 and got into bronze 1, and season four 2-8 and bronze two. Can someone try and help explain to me why I got placed so poorly but did decently in my promos?","replies":[{"poster":"Jonius7","date":"2016-05-10T02:51:52.924+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yeah, if you got placed in Bronze previous 2 seasons, you won't get into Silver just using placements, unless you climbed tiers during preseason.\nHere's my placements as an example:\n- In Season 4 I went 3-7 and got Bronze II. \n- In Season 5 I went 1-9 and got Bronze V, climbed all the way to Bronze II (Bronze I in preseason)\n- This season I went 5-5 and got Bronze III.\n\nBasically I'd expect placements to put you at the same or lower than last season.\n\nEDIT: op.gg says you got to Gold last season!!??","replies":[{"poster":"Talon12","date":"2016-05-10T11:19:39.221+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"he is bronze 4 for me","replies":[{"poster":"Jonius7","date":"2016-05-11T06:07:01.878+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Bronze 4 now yes.

Personally I went 8-2 and got Bronze 5, which I'm not mad at, because I'll end up where I belong anyway. The wave of people complaining about placements has already been if you missed it, and they are all in their old ranks now anyways.\n\nChances are that if you got placed in Silver with 5-5, you would end up in Bronze again anyway with a 50% win rate and decaying mmr from landing Silver.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Ing√©nue","date":"2016-05-10T02:32:44.551+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"what rank did you end up last season? All the websites are saying different things. \n\nAt the beginning of each season, MMR endures a \"soft reset\". This basically means that it will take your MMR and lower it bit so when you do your placements, you end up slightly lower than where you ended (usually).\n\nFrom what I gathered on the boards at the beginning of season, if you won 7-8 games, you would get placed where you left off. Out of everyone I know, only one person ended up higher, and that is because he went from bronze to diamond during preseason. (This part is purely speculative, as nothing official is released on how MMR works).","replies":[{"poster":"TheDeadNight","date":"2016-05-10T02:50:02.317+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thanks for the clairvoyance, I ended up Bronze One last season.","replies":[]}]}]}
