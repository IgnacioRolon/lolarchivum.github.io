I really like the look of azir I just wish I was able to have more in-depth guides about him plus I think my friend wants. the other problem is that they  play so many different champs its hard to choose one that they haven&#039;t play or just started to as they saw I was playing them. so if you have any suggestions please tell me and I would love to share my comments. Plus and good team strategies would be much appreciated\r\n\r\nI like mages the most ;P","replies":[{"poster":"Miicka","date":"2016-08-17T23:35:31.130+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Dude seriously, Ahri is not as hard to play as all those Ahri mains make out. Maybe I'm just good at her, but I seriously think she isn't that hard to play. Don't get me wrong though, she is still a little hard to play, and can easily solo carry games once learned.\n\nI don't know much about Azir as I haven't played him that much, but I do know he can be extremely strong when mastered.\n\nI'm not sure if she's your kind of champion, but I actually think riven is really fun and strong once mastered. Yes, I know, I know, 'Riven is op' and 'Riven is the cancer of league', but I think people really underestimate how much skill it actually takes to play her.\n\nSo yeah, definitely give Azir a shot if your thinking of him, and Ahri is really fun as well.","replies":[]},{"poster":"TheOneUser","date":"2016-08-17T07:29:02.904+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"anivia, cass and ziggs are pretty nice but aren't very mobile.\nazir is still good though he got quite a few nerfs","replies":[]},{"poster":"Star","date":"2016-08-17T05:24:06.527+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Azir is super rewarding to play once you've mastered him. Unfortunately he's been extremely nerfed at the moment and is really not on the strong end. \n\nAhri is fun too, but my champion of pick is Taliyah. \n\nTaliyah has an extremely high win percentage when people learn to master her. She's got amazing roam and great potential. Another is Viktor. \n\nIf you have specific questions about Azir, i could probably help answer a few (like what is the 'shurima shuffle'- something you'll need to master to be good with him).","replies":[]}]}
