I find that living in Oceania is some what of a disability for us. Can you please think it through and I hope you make a server here","replies":[{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2016-10-19T11:49:51.837+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"There is only one PBE server. It is located in NA, but any player with a level 30 account in good standing on the NA, EUW and EUNE accounts can sign up and try their luck getting a PBE account.\n\nThere are a number of reasons they don't create multiple PBE servers or allow universal access, one such reason being:\n\n>There are multiple problems that would be created if we made PBE access a universal privilege. For starters, unlimited global access onto a single small environment would create painful login queues and server instability. It also prevents us from ensuring a constructive in-game experience since unlimited access means some \"active\" players may have no intention of experimenting with content, looking for bugs or providing feedback. By carefully controlling PBE access, we're better able to foster an environment where testers are positive, active and engaged.\n\nYou can read more about that [HERE](http://na.leagueoflegends.com/en/page/pbe-faq).\nIf you really want to be a PBE tester, you can level up an account on NA and apply from there.\n\nThe other big reason is that all the dev happens in NA. That is where Riot's main offices are so it makes sense to have the PBE server there. If any other server got a local PBE it'd be EU long before any other server. This isn't a case of OCE getting the short end of the stick cause we're small, noone else has PBE.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Jason","date":"2016-10-19T10:40:31.839+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"A fair few OCE people have access to the PBE. It's a bit annoying playing on the PBE with the latency issues, however we still have that option.\n\nGetting into the PBE isn't always simple, but Riot has shown favoritism to community members, content creators, analysts, and pros.  Hang around, and continue to be a positive force on Summoners Rift, and you might be accepted sometime soon :)","replies":[]},{"poster":"EMP Implosion","date":"2016-10-19T10:30:07.044+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The highest majority of players hail from NA only a portion get to play on PBE.
