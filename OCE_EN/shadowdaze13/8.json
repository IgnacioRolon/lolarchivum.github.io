The other thing is do you guys hate Janna for some reason because she doesn&#039;t have a champion spotlight I don&#039;t know why but maybe you can try to update the spot lights when abilities get changed or there are big changes to the game such as runes and masterys (mainly mastery&#039;s and items) . I really hope you guys can try fix this","replies":[{"poster":"Nightjar","date":"2017-02-09T05:38:36.044+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I kinda like the fact they keep the old spotlights and cinematics. It makes league feel kind of historic and grand, that the game has evolved so much since it's first iteration, and that even though I've only been playing league for a year, that I can play and be part of it.","replies":[]}]}
