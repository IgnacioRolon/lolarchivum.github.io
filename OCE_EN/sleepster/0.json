What i know so far is that this champion is a dragon, i cant draw at all so i don&#039;t have any art for it but random pictures i found. \n---> http://pichost.me/1823099/ <---\n\nThe lore i have thought of so far is that She was once the Queen of the skies and protected all that lived in Runeterra from attacks from the sky. But one day she was imprisoned in diamonds and crystals by the old gods of Runeterra.\n\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n**Lyrothh, Protector of the Sky**\n\n**_Base Stats_**\nHealth 430 (+96)\nHealth Regen 7.3 (+0.85)\nWind 200\nRange 125\nAttack Damage 56 (+3.4)\nAttack Speed 0.638 (+3.5%)\nArmor 20 (+3.5)\nMagic Resist 30 (+1.25)\nMovement Speed 350\n\n\n**Abilities**\n\n_**Passive - Tempest**_\nWindCost: None.\nCooldown: None.\nGenerate 5 Wind per second while out of combat.\nGains Wind from 2% of the damage taken from Champions and 20% from jungle creeps.\n\nLyrothh&#039;s Passive is Tempest. While Lyrothh has 125+ Wind, Lyrothh hovers above the ground and takes 10% less damage from melee enemies and increases damage taken from ranged enemies by 5%.\n\n_**Q - Wing Burst**_\nWind Cost: 80/75/70/65/60\nCooldown: ~~6 Seconds~~ ->  10 Seconds\nDamage Over Time: ~~160/170/180/190/200~~ ->  120/130/140/150/160\nDamage Duration: 2.5 Seconds\nSlow Duration: 2.5 Seconds\nSlow Strength: 15/20/25/30/35%\nRatio: (+150% Remaining Wind After Use)(+60% Ability Power)\nRange: 450\nChampion Move range: 400\n\nLyrothh&#039;s Q is Wing Burst. Lyrothh Flaps her wings redirecting the air to pull all enemies towards her violently and slowing them.\n\n_**W - Vengeful Roar**_\nWind Cost: 25\nCooldown: 20/19/18/17/16 Seconds\nAttack Damage: (+1% Health)\nMovement Speed: (+1% Health)\nBuff Duration: 3/3.5/4/4.5/5 Seconds\n\nLyrothh&#039;s W is Vengeful Roar. Lyrothh roars manipulating the wind around her increasing the force on her melee attacks and increasing her movement capabilities for a few seconds.\n\n_**E - Crystal Scales**_\nPassive:\nCooldown: 100 Seconds\nWhen Health drops below 35%, Gain Health: 100/125/150/175/200 (+80% Armor)(+80% Magic Resist)\nDuration: 15 Seconds\n\nActive:\nWind Cost: 40\nCooldown: 15 Seconds\nArmor Buff: 12/14/16/18/20\nMagic Resist Buff: 12/14/16/18/20\n\nLyrothh&#039;s E is Crystal Scales. When Lyrothh is on low health, she purifies the air around her using her defensive strength increasing her health considerably. Lyrothh can crystallizes the air around her scales increasing her defenses.\n\n_**R  - Valkyria Assault**_\nWind Cost: 100\nCooldown: 130/125/120/115/110 Seconds\n\nFirst Cast:\nDamage: 150/200/250\nSlow Duration: ~~2.5 Seconds~~ -> 1.75 Seconds\nSlow Strength: 55/65/75%\nRatio: (+40% Ability Power)\nRange: 1100\n\nSecond Cast:\nBleed Damage: 250/300/350\nBleed Duration: 3 Seconds\nStun Duration: 1 Second\nRatio: (+60% Attack Damage)\nRange: 1300\nAoE Range: 475\nMin Time Between Casts: 0 Seconds\nMax Time Between Casts: 3 Seconds\n\nLyrothh&#039;s R is Valkyria Assault. Lyrothh sends a large freezing gust of wind in front of her chilling all enemies hit slowing them considerably and doing a decent amount of damage. She can then take to the sky and crash down on top of a target location sending pieces of rocks upwards around the area causing enemies to be stunned and take a large amount of damage over time.","replies":[{"poster":"ShuffledPancake","date":"2015-05-08T12:00:49.470+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Introducing a new fuel type seems like the 2nd worst part of this, but the 1st would be  THAT DMG DOE","replies":[]},{"poster":"sparklefart","date":"2015-04-29T04:39:41.426+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Looks like you can Q W R for an instant penta :D\nShe sounds fun but the scaling needs to be reduced","replies":[{"poster":"Sleepster","date":"2015-04-29T22:04:28.124+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"yea, i dont feel scaling down the R would be viable, it might just make her really weak in late game but to reduce early/mid i guess you can change the Q scaling to 120/130/140/150/160 and increase its Cooldown to 10 seconds. _(keep in mind that its a damage over time debuff on both of her damage abilities)_","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Sikitywiked","date":"2015-04-29T02:10:15.981+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"the more dragons in the game the better lol :P","replies":[{"poster":"Sleepster","date":"2015-04-29T02:11:36.338+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Everything needs more dragons!!!!!!","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"MrPine","date":"2015-04-29T01:38:13.285+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Idea sounds amazing and fun to play but the stats seem mad op :p","replies":[{"poster":"Sleepster","date":"2015-04-29T02:10:13.249+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"yea it's hard to get a good ratio on the stats without testing the champ out, better to make it fun op rather than uselessly weak xD","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Sylpharion","date":"2015-05-01T11:25:53.052+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Sounds a bit like Zephyr from HoN but it also has it's own individuality.\n\nI think Wing Burst, the name itself doesn't really sound right to its own ability, I find that it gives an idea of a glowing wing charging up and on the next cast or ability it will burst around in her personal AoE. I like the ability but how much does it pull or does it pull to her like the Blitzcrank grab? I'm a little confused due to this seeming a lot like Zephyr's Q where he pushes everyone in the direction of him but not like up all close and personal like a Blitzcrank or Nautilus Q.\n\nI find that Vengeful Roar really allows her to be a top lane bully like she should be but you should really add an attackspeed boost, this ability seems a bit plain, it doesn't really give her much AD late game and would be more of a gapcloser to Q or to run away. Personally I'd do it so her attacks deal 1 / 1.5 / 2 / 2.5 / 3% of her maximum per attack for a short duration or to a limited amount of attacks, this really allows her to emphasize her little damage.\n\nCrystal Scales is really nice ability but could you go into detail for me? Why would you have 15 seconds duration if all she is going to do is heal herself, the ability itself is a great defensive buff and I like the idea behind it.\n\nThis sounds a lot like a Sejuani Ult + Aatrox Q, I think it's best to choose 1 or just come with something completely new like Queen's Gate where she creates a large impassable battlefield for the enemy and her own team but her team is buffed for a bit but making it quite fair. The only way to escape similar to Azir's Ult is flashing not dashing. \n\nI find her kit a bit over the top with the amount of crowd control she has, ontop of that she's a tank who could focus on a single stat and get up to 80% damage reduction without her passive, the 5% extra from ranged attacks don't really mean much when she has the amount of crowd control as Gnar able to completely lock down a single unit or force it direction and allowing her team to follow up.
