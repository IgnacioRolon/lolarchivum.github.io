It&#039;s where I started playing League before OCE existed. I&#039;m in a Gold V team, not that Rank  is important. Just wanting to show that I&#039;m not just new to League. I&#039;m trying to level an account up on OCE because there is less lag. (I&#039;m currently level 18). But it&#039;s hard when the people I meet on here, most games, are the most toxic players I&#039;ve ever come across in my 3 years of being on League. I&#039;m getting to the point where I&#039;m not enjoying playing LoL. At all. As a girl I loved the fact that I was/am considered EQUAL by most people. But now, it&#039;s a becoming a place where I&#039;m bullied and harassed by people in my OWN COUNTRY and it&#039;s getting worse. {{item:3070}}{{item:3070}} I just do not understand it. At least on NA when people are salty they insult your GAMING and the decisions you make. Over here on OCE they insult you as a person. Every game is becoming less enjoyable.  Reporting people after most games because they&#039;re just so horribly toxic. Yes, I mute them also. I want to play here on OCE. A fair amount of people I meet are fun, kind, and we have a great time. {{summoner:31}}  But OCE, through the people I meet on other games and even the friends I occasionally make on here, is getting the reputation for being the MOST TOXIC region of League of Legends. I don&#039;t understand why this is.

But raising these points, I'm sure the OP would like some sort of standards set in the community, and Riot to implement a system to set those standards. But like the Lady with Legs said, I am disturbed by some peoples reaction to the OP's post and her further comments. Lets have a look at some of those now:\n\n> [{quoted}](name=C0ntract,realm=OCE,application-id=Ntey9fRZ,discussion-id=8Fb3sIAF,comment-id=,timestamp=2015-05-17T03:30:47.948+0000)\n>\n> Over here on OCE they insult you as a person.\n\nIt's a sign of the internet culture these days. People casually throw out these personal attacks like it is water from the tap and they have no class or sense of culture. It's not being a great role model for kids of the future. Of course the kids copy this behaviour. And the only way to combat this sort of thing is to EMBARASS them. Because direct methods just egg them on moreso. I've had plenty of games where i speak logic to idiots who can only abuse via personal attack and it just does not get through. However if they make a mistake on the rift, embarassing them about that mistake shuts them up quickly. Thats not to say I personally attack them, I just offer some friendly advice that points out the embarassing mistake they just made (usually its chasing some enemy with lack of vision and dying to the enemy team).\n\n> [{quoted}](name=xDarkRavenx,realm=OCE,application-id=Ntey9fRZ,discussion-id=8Fb3sIAF,comment-id=000300010000,timestamp=2015-05-17T05:48:12.061+0000)\n>\n> If you have a problem with our toxic server, then don't play on our server.

Why should you care what anonymous and insignificant people have to say?\n\nBecause nobody is insignificant, everybody is equal. And by making people feel that they are insignificant makes them strive more to be recognised, by doing stupid dramatic things that are not helping the situation. Let's find a better solution than just to accept it, because 15 years ago, people were much more politer on the internet. People valued it as a luxury and did not take it for granted.\n\n> [{quoted}](name=hi im ben,realm=OCE,application-id=Ntey9fRZ,discussion-id=8Fb3sIAF,comment-id=0002,timestamp=2015-05-17T05:00:27.503+0000)\n>\n> It's what Australians do, deal with it.\n\nNo actually, its not what Australians do. What happened to mateship and being given a fair go? Toxic bullying is unacceptable and sweeping it under the carpet is sending the message that it is ok, and nobody cares.\n\n> [{quoted}](name=A Lady With Legs,realm=OCE,application-id=Ntey9fRZ,discussion-id=8Fb3sIAF,comment-id=000a,timestamp=2015-05-17T14:23:00.465+0000)\n> OP is being called out for being 'weak' and 'spineless'. Ironically, those who make excuses for such behaviour are defending a horde of immature, culturally-depraved losers. I wouldn't watch someone piss on my bed and think, 'Well, gee, that's modern Australian culture for you!'\n\nExactly, why defend toxic people? Start to do that and the whole community will be a bunch of toxic morons. And it will become acceptable to be such a moron. Is that what you want? If you think that there is nothing you can do as a community about the situation, then just keep your mouth shut, don't defend poor behaviour because you have nothing to offer.\n\n> [{quoted}](name=Seasons of Love,realm=OCE,application-id=Ntey9fRZ,discussion-id=8Fb3sIAF,comment-id=00010002,timestamp=2015-05-17T22:46:04.558+0000)\n>\n> This kind of fucking attitude is the real problem here. It's not weak not to want to be treated like shit. \n> \n> Why are people on here so fucking stupid.\n\nPeople love to feel significant by spouting off the first thing that enters their head. Modern culture has this phenomenon where people are so desperate for significance that even guys on buses are acting like a bunch of mad californian valley girls, saying the first thing that hits their noodle and hopes that it impresses other people.\n\nWhen in reality, all they have to do is be themselves, not acting. Behave how you want to be treated. A lot of people are stupid. It takes them years to figure out this simple fact, which amounts to a  lot of time wasting.\n\n> [{quoted}](name=C0ntract,realm=OCE,application-id=Ntey9fRZ,discussion-id=8Fb3sIAF,comment-id=0003000100000000000000010000000000000000,timestamp=2015-05-18T09:42:28.674+0000)\n>\n> So you don't appreciate being pulled up on something?\n\nThey certainly don't. They don't have the logical skills to begin to defend their witless impulsive comments. They don't have responsibility for being wrong either. So expect them to dance around it, and never admit that they make mistakes. This is also a phenomenon of modern (internet) culture, invented by the yanks of course.\n\n> [{quoted}](name=noogai,realm=OCE,application-id=Ntey9fRZ,discussion-id=8Fb3sIAF,comment-id=00010002000100000000000000000000,timestamp=2015-05-20T13:44:58.933+0000)\n>\n> How dense are you? Are you related at all to a family of Neutron Stars?\n> \n> You literally don't have to put up with toxic players. There are multiple mute buttons. It's not even hard to find them, hit tab while in game to bring up the scoreboard, click the little speaker icon next to somebody's name.\n> \n> Wow, look, you can't see the toxic chat any more!\n> \n> How hard was that?\n\nThat does not solve the issue at hand. If we fix the issue as a community in the first place, there will be no need to mute your own teammates. Because communicating with them is the key to victory, muting them is counterproductive. Lets fix toxicity instead.\n\n> [{quoted}](name=x69DxYxLxAxN69x,realm=OCE,application-id=Ntey9fRZ,discussion-id=8Fb3sIAF,comment-id=000600000000000000000000000000000000,timestamp=2015-05-20T16:14:52.948+0000)\n>\n> Well I'm not keen on talking to a brick wall anymore so have fun waiting for Riot to create a miracle system that will remove/change the attitudes of every single toxic player!\n\nIt's not a miracle, its LOGICAL. Define better standards, implement those standards, and most of all do not tolerate bullying. The long term gains for riot would be phenomenal.\n\n> [{quoted}](name=kJs,realm=OCE,application-id=Ntey9fRZ,discussion-id=8Fb3sIAF,comment-id=0006000000000000000000000000000000000000,timestamp=2015-05-20T16:21:44.584+0000)\n>\n> It's not going to change unless everyone collectively does so.\n> \n> Riot and its players need to get this point across and you're resisting this positive change. There's literally no negatives to have a less toxic chat.\n\nThis is so true. I sincerely hope that a better system is put in place. As a matter of personal fact, i've quit playing ranked (silver level) on my smurf because of the toxicity and barbaric lack of logical skills of players. Personal attacks because they cannot accept LOGICAL FACTS are just unacceptable. Just because a teammate is unskilled is no reason to personally attack them. Why do they not HELP THE TEAM by helping the unskilled player with advice, or go gank their lane and help them, or just shut up and say nothing?\n\nI do hope Riot reads this thread and implements harsher policies for bullies. Even a \"hellbanned\" division for toxic players could be an idea. One in which they wouldn't even know they were in.

I can post what I want since you're letting OP post whatever OP wants. You're pretty much being the smart ass here and please don't contradict what I'm saying right now. I actually enjoy posting and it's your/their problem if a lot of people's time and effort has been wasted. Like you said above, \"you don't have to read it\", \"you don't have to comment on it.\" So don't be hypocritical. You've basically read what I commented and commented on it.","replies":[{"poster":"Whacking","date":"2015-05-18T03:36:06.493+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"How is Spellowned  being hypocritical by calling you out on something?

When I was in bronze 5, I had to carry myself to Silver 5. I had notice that everyone was very toxic, so I had to mute, like 50% of peoples in each games. When someone is nice and friendly, I tend to add them, since everyone is toxic in OCE.
