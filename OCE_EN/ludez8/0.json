(Split push when you can’t win a team fight but can escape or win a duel by having your allies pressure a lane and stall, so you can either grab a free tower or lure opponents to you and give your allies an uphill fight. If your allies aren't also putting pressure on the map [e.g. they got quadra’ed at dragon, dragons gone, opponents are all up, you’re the only one alive] its too late) Splitting also gives you a chance to comeback when behind because the opponent may lose minions to towers while you gain the side lanes solo exp and gold which can make you strong enough to win the game by yourself if left unchecked.)\n14.\tKnow when to back off and press tab to check opponents items so you can determine if you can win a fight or not.\n15.\tIf you want to consistently win fights, keep up the vision control so you know where your opponents are, so you can pick good fights. \n\n(250 gold trinket for the ability to keep up 3 wards at a time for the rest of the game once your lv 9 allowing you to juke 5 opponents around 1v1ing them 1 by 1 to win game? Yes please)\n\nTeam compositions and Champion combos are way too hard to pull off in bronze, I would say don't worry about the team comp unless you can play the champion to a good level and know how to abuse the champions power spikes and forcing optimal situations to carry your game and can also get your team to work together.\n\nPersonally I think it's a lot harder to play adc reliant supports in bronze in OCE because people can't follow up on plays or work well as a team. Mid and Top lane also aren't as reliable as there is a high chance that each side will either snowball really hard or feed really hard. By the time you get out of laning phase, the most fed laner will just 1 shot everyone with half an auto attack from being up 20 kills in 10 minutes so unless you are duo'ing with someone else who knows what they are doing, I wouldn't advise heavy adc reliant supports like leona who is supposed to all in the enemy during power spikes (lv 2 &amp; 6) hoping that their adc will auto attack 2 times until silver league where players can follow up on engages.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Daejel","date":"2015-03-12T22:02:36.923+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You realised you're bad. That's a good thing as it means you are actually capable of learning from your mistakes. I'd say learn a few champs well in one or two roles and just focus on improving instead of your LP. You will rise anyway.\n\nAlso be prepared to support if necessary and learn that to a capable level.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Deche","date":"2015-03-12T20:07:48.458+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yea I would love too. \n\nAdd me ingame and we can start :)\n\nI will be showing you what to do and what not to do to escape bronze.","replies":[]}]}
