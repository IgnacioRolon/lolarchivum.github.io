I'll go find the news announcement for it and drop the link here.\n\nAs far as the URF club/booster purchase, I'm fairly sure that was removed from the store at some point and is no longer purchasable, in which case you're too late for that. The information should be available in the post regarding the extension (if not, I'll find it).\n\nEDIT: I've found the news announcement for it, which you'll find at [this link](https://oce.leagueoflegends.com/en/news/game-updates/gameplay/arurf-extended-4-more-weeks). It doesn't state a date, but it does state that ARURF will only remain until the end of patch 9.6, and generally modes/events end a day or two *before* the new patch goes live, so April 1st or 2nd should be when it will end.\n\nSo far as the Golden Spatula Club, it's stated on that same page (and *should* be stated in all the original information) that that was only available until the 15th of February, so unfortunately you wont be able to get that now.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Apposl","date":"2019-01-29T18:35:31.278+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Oh wow, that kinda made my day.
