The system is a lil fucky around playing with low elo friends, so myself and 2 friends are d4/p2/p2 and are all tier 3-4. You can check your clash tier on the clash tab in client. AD/JG is taken atm, everything else is open. We'd really like a mid as our third plays top/support.\n\nIf you are interested join my discord http://discord.gg/KzfmWJW and dm me @Poke (im at the top). Don't bother adding me on league as my friend requests are full.","replies":[]}
