As our community loved the old discord so much, we decided to remake it! \r\n\r\nWe have made sure to carry over all the most important features of the old server onto the new one. There will still be plenty of text and voice channels to talk about the game, and the ranked channel, to make it easy to connect with people of similar skill level. \r\n\r\nThe new version of the server will have similar values to the old, one of which is to facilitate the community of dedicated league players, while still accommodating newer ones. It will be getting updated with more features as more people join the server! But most importantly, we don't promote hateful conduct in any way. It's our only rule, don't be an asshole. We are aware that the old discord had developed a somewhat toxic community, and it is our top priority to make that it doesn't happen here.\r\n\r\nI'd love to see you guys join, and I'm sure I'll see some of you on the rift in my hardstuck Diamond 4 games. Good luck In soloQ everyone!\r\n\r\n\r\n{{sticker:slayer-jinx-wink}}\r\n\r\nNote: Had to remake my post as admins from another server trying to rebuild the community spam downvoted my old post on all their accounts. Sorry for the inconvenience if I caused any.","replies":[]}
