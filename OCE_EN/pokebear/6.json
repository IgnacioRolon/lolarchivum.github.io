As our community loved the old discord so much, we decided to remake it! \n\nWe have made sure to carry over all the most important features of the old server onto the new one. There will still be plenty of text and voice channels to talk about the game, and the ranked channel, to make it easy to connect with people of similar skill level. \n\nThe new version of the server will have similar values to the old, one of which is to facilitate the community of dedicated league players, while still accommodating newer ones. It will be getting updated with more features as more people join the server! But most importantly, we don't promote hateful conduct in any way. It's our only rule, don't be an asshole. We are aware that the old discord had developed a somewhat toxic community, and it is our top priority to make that it doesn't happen here.\n\nI'd love to see you guys join, and I'm sure I'll see some of you on the rift in my hardstuck Diamond 4 games. Good luck In soloQ everyone!\n\n\n{{sticker:slayer-jinx-wink}}","replies":[{"poster":"axeI","date":"2019-07-31T08:17:08.656+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"A fair warning to those who are considering joining this server. I remember being in this server before on and off from time to time. It's just a **cesspit **filled with the same 20-30 active people in a clique just being overall nasty and spouting disgusting inappropriate garbage just to start arguments with anyone etc. If I do recall, the admin/owner of this server was Trin. \n\nIt's not a community where you necessarily find people to play league with or make friends. It's an established collective group with a hierarchy to assert their powers when needed. Community RP giveaways were the only decent thing this server had going, aside from that it really wasn't a friendly environment nor something I would recommend anyone joining.\n\nIf the OP honestly thinks reviving this and restoring the same values as before is going to salvage it - I say this to anyone reading. **Do not join this server**, a rebranding, a new admin team won't change the fact that it's a haven for hate speech (not that I'm opposed to free speech) but it breathes a lot of this rhetoric that it's okay to be an asshole to other people.\n\nGood riddance.\n\n_**Edit: After having a discussion with the new owner, I wish him and the team well to uphold standards. Those that choose to join this server do so willingly and can judge whether it's fit for them/their needs.**_","replies":[{"poster":"PokeBear","date":"2019-07-31T09:02:09.893+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":2,"body":"Honestly didn't realise the old server was known for these things. I mostly used it to recruit players for tournaments and events, and didn't use the general chat much. Our new server will not promote hate speech/being a general asshole, in fact, it's our only rule. Thanks for making me aware about what the old server was apparently about, I'll edit my post to reflect this.\n{{sticker:slayer-pantheon-thumbs}}","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"smurfNoob","date":"2019-07-31T03:57:21.037+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"You guys are kappa\n{{sticker:slayer-jinx-catface}}","replies":[{"poster":"Sad BMO","date":"2019-07-31T04:10:00.813+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"{{sticker:slayer-pantheon-thumbs}}","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"KittyEmmy","date":"2019-07-31T07:14:21.604+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"{{sticker:sg-ahri-2}}","replies":[]},{"poster":"PokeBear","date":"2019-07-31T00:55:01.874+0000","up_votes":0,"down_votes":3,"body":"Sorry for the repost, the link i put wasn't working. {{sticker:zombie-brand-facepalm}}","replies":[]}]}
