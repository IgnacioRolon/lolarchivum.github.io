I made more gold than my top laner and he wasn't AFK. Time to main top jk not changing my main role because of how cancerous other people are. I play support because they hold the most playmaking power in the early game and mid game and they're the reason why adcs are the highest damage late game. Also, playing support trains your positioning, item builds and identifying mistakes more than any other role.\n\nTop lane is about zoning and top jungle control. Mid lane is about out-farming, tracking the enemy jungler and identifying power spikes. Jungle is about zone control, pressure, and pushing. ADC is about playing like a complete pansy and facerolling late game. Roam (yes it's somewhat a position, even though not in the META) is about making your enemy jungler's life hell (teemo shrooms, donger harrass, shaco boxes, zyra plants, sapling stacking etc) and securing objectives.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Mar3thyu","date":"2015-02-06T10:42:01.033+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"that's why I play sup if no one else can play well","replies":[]},{"poster":"GoldenTomat0","date":"2015-02-06T07:54:26.493+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Nice double post.
