Its not fair how you can just do half someones health under tower then just E away untouched. \r\n\r\nYou don't even have to use it for it to be useful. Lots of people don't use their important skills until fizz E's because if they do then fizz will kill them.\r\n\r\nThis skill is cancer to the game. Not sure why riot would give someone a low cooldown invincibility that does a lot of damage.","replies":[{"poster":"Jakiron","date":"2015-02-13T22:49:37.961+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"He can't use it to do damage then e away.\n\nIt is an escape **or** gapcloser/damage.\n\nAnd his other skills got nerfed so...\n\nI think it's fine.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Niji","date":"2015-02-14T09:03:53.160+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I agree his E is one of the most problematic basic skills in the game but I don't think \"Removing it\" is the best solution at least make some sort of suggestion as to how to change it.","replies":[]},{"poster":"JasonWazza","date":"2015-02-14T01:13:25.747+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Play Veigar, wait for E, once E is used, stun field+full combo.\n\nFizz is now ~~Slaughtered~~ cured","replies":[{"poster":"hðnkƒørÇªmíllè","date":"2015-02-14T08:35:19.555+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You don't even have to wait, he still gets stunned if he tries to backflip over it anyways iirc.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"RageGrace","date":"2015-02-14T00:02:35.510+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"16 seconds of CD isn't low? Especially since any Fizz players would max it last. You literally have 16 seconds of opportunity to kill him once it's down.
