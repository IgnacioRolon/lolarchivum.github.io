It is also really annoying because my two best roles are Supp/ADC and if I am not last pick I am definitely gonna try and go for one of those (less chance of feeding, less chance of flame). Then the duo will probably get angry, start abusing in the pre game lobby, can't mute them until in game and by then the amygdala is triggering the hypothalamic pituitary adrenal axis, making me go on tilt.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Wiggy","date":"2015-02-11T19:11:05.014+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Truth be told, bronze silver and even gold, the MAJORITY of duos I've come across are hella bad, so there's a bit of a stigma against them now","replies":[{"poster":"Dawaraven","date":"2015-02-12T07:56:28.179+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Wiggy,realm=OCE,application-id=Ntey9fRZ,discussion-id=gljXFrWe,comment-id=00000000,timestamp=2015-02-11T19:11:05.014+0000)\n>\n> Truth be told, bronze silver and even gold, the MAJORITY of duos I've come across are hella bad, so there's a bit of a stigma against them now\n\nyer I notice that too lol.
