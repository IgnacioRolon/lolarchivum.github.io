You are probably correct in the fact that she is Freelo, everyone else says it. But like, how? I just don't get it.","replies":[{"poster":"Best Viktor AU","date":"2015-02-25T10:05:47.516+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"2 second CD Q that chunks half your health, AOE root slow W that does a lot of damage, massive gapcloser that also does good damage, invincibility ult for herself or on an enemy that does MASSIVE aoe damage.

Not even squishies. It does good damage but not that much damage. It's also very very short range. W is just an AOE root, no slow there, and it also does good damage but not THAT much. The gapcloser true, has decent range but the claw is always visible, making it easy to flash or dash or run away early. \n\nALL of her abilities have short range and ALL apart from Q have long cooldowns. She is *somewhat* high risk high reward due to her range. And the AOE Massive ult damage, doesn't actually do all that much damage...\n\nLissandra has never been the highest damaging of all mages, that was the tradeoff for all this cc. Name any other conventional AP Mid laner and that champion will almost for sure do more damage than Lissandra, but they will definitely have less cc. \n\nThis must've one fed as balls Lissandra you're referring to here.
