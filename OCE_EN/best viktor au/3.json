However, the ones who make out they are entitled to bot lane are generally the ones you know about, and they generally yell at people who want a bot lane position. The duo bots who make a big deal out of being a duo-queued bot lane and get toxic are the ones who you generally know about, and toxic players ruin games.","replies":[{"poster":"Varza","date":"2015-02-17T11:43:03.536+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hope this is evidence enough ... Duo bot got me to plat last season (image below of final games) \n\nSometimes even if we lose lane, the fact that my support and I communicate well and work together helps just as much in mid-to-end game when I need peels or help making picks \n\nAlso I like having somebody on my team that I know is happy to support, rather than having a 5th pick get forced into it, perform badly then demotivate the team","replies":[]},{"poster":"Tomblade","date":"2015-02-14T12:29:55.662+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"These are my thoughts exactly!","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Project Xayah","date":"2015-02-14T07:12:52.504+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"What if there are two duo bot's in one game?
