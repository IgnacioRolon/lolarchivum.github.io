I don&#039;t want to buy a QSS because I&#039;m losing an essential item of my build and it upgrades into an AD item. It&#039;s just an idea and it&#039;d be very useful for us AP players.

If they can just QSS the CC and use their burst anyway it would make some champs alot harder to play against","replies":[]},{"poster":"Unseen Predator","date":"2015-05-25T10:14:22.628+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Sure, lets just delete Warwick, Malzahar, Zed, Lissandra, Annie, Cassiopeia, Galio..... You know what ill stop there, i think its pretty clear why AP should not have a QSS, sit the fuck down and think for a minute on why that is, after five years of not having a QSS for AP you still ask for it.","replies":[]},{"poster":"SkarSkarSkarner","date":"2015-05-25T09:48:47.893+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Vayne only stuns if you hit a wall.
