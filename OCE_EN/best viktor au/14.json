Irelia is not as easy as she seems. Some champions don't require too much game knowledge to play well, but you really gotta know what you're doing with Irelia.

For example, there are 4-5 champions I like to play in the top lane. If the enemy team picks Rumble I can open up lolcounter and say, \"Oh, Cho'Gath counters Rumble? Well he's one of my strongest top laners anyway so it would be a good idea to pick him and take the easy matchup.\"","replies":[]},{"poster":"Crusader charlie","date":"2015-02-25T23:13:21.681+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"yeah but it kind of takes the zest out of it. \ni mean you aren't *really*  earning your level/rank up benefits with a tool like that it seems.","replies":[]}]}
