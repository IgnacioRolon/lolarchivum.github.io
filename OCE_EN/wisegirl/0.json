I had to find Jayce, Okay let me put this into context i&#039;m Ezreal The Prodigal Explorer. Jayce about an hour ago had well crashed my date with... Okay he pulled me to go meet the last bastion, a small group which was anti DarkStar the DarkStar led by a previously human person who lost his humanity now called Thresh. this small group well wanted information from me, when would the Dark star rise. I well was compelled to give them what i had, did i mention that the Last Bastion consisted of a few familiar faces the leader Vayne and her team of five including her consisted of Wukong, Lucian, Irelia and Sivir. \r\n\r\nI felt a small tap,i turned to see...Luxanna Crownguard. &quot;Lux, Why are you here. The Last Bastion is about to begin hunting for the DarkStar.&quot;\r\n\r\n&quot;Well... I&#039;m here to propose something, you know my power to manipulate light right?&quot; She said meekly.\r\n\r\n&quot;Of Course I know.&quot; I said my cheeks going crimson .\r\n\r\n&quot;I well can cover them under a veil of light, so they can be right next to Thresh. And they say Thresh let the dark star consume his mortal body so he could become the embodiment of the DarkStar.&quot;\r\n\r\n&quot;How do you know this,&quot; i said.\r\n\r\n&quot;I read a book from the Demacian Library Of History and Myths.&quot; She said.\r\n\r\n&quot;Ok, I&#039;m bring you to the Last Bastion.&quot; I said as my receiver received the all good ping. I grabbed her hand and dragged her to the designated hiding spot, for them to lay an ambush. I quickly whispered the plan to all of them then. &quot;well That works but a team of five is preferable for such sorcery.&quot; Sivir said.\r\n\r\n&quot;What Sivir said is correct.&quot; I hear lux agree.\r\n\r\nI stop and think. So that means were going to have one of the Bastion stay with me in HQ. \r\n\r\n&quot;I&#039;ll stay.&quot; I hear wukong pipe up. \r\n\r\n&quot;Ok well Bastion The DarkStar has appeared at... Piltover academy of sciences.&quot; I said to My Dismay","replies":[]}
