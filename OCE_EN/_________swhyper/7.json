Any League related issues such as connection problem/fps problem etc, feel free to post them here or make a new discussion and I will get back to you guys in a jiffy xD. This way, everyone is able to get a quick response rather than submit a ticket to RIOT. \r\n\r\nHave a great day and look forward to roaming around the League help &amp; support boards :D. I will spend most of my time here, keeping an eye out for your guy&#039;s post. \r\n\r\nCheers\r\nSwhyper","replies":[]}
