Let&#039;s get started. So basically I sometimes go to the net cafe to play League Of Legends. Net cafe&#039;s are the best places to play League as I have made quite a lot of friends there hehe also it is close to food shops which is very convenient if you get hungry. So as I was in the net cafe, I decided to start my first game by playing Rank. As I was in champ select, it was my turn to pick a champ so I locked in my champ. After I locked in my champ I decided to go to the men&#039;s bathroom/toilet quickly. When I returned, the champ select was still going and teams were almost finished picking their champs. I was shocked to see that as I returned from going to the toilet, some stranger (Unknown name) decided it would be fun to hop on my net cafe computer and started typing random toxic things in my champ select chat. This was quite shocking and I am disappointed that someone would do something to my account while I was gone to the bathroom. I hope you all understood how much I was going through and I hope this will be a lesson to you all to always take care of your League account wherever you go.  Have a great day guys :) .","replies":[{"poster":"Project Xayah","date":"2016-11-24T02:00:47.732+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Completely your fault. You shouldn't be leaving yourself logged in while not at the computer in public places.","replies":[{"poster":"         Swhyper","date":"2016-11-24T02:07:19.220+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Exactly.  I'm not saying it's not my fault but I'm trying to inform everyone of my situation and hope that everyone will be cautious :D.","replies":[]}]}]}
