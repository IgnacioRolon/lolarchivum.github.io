In fact, I've seen people blame teammates for giving \"strong\" champs away which further highlights the pressure to not \"mess up the picks\". \n\nI love the concept but the way it turns out in game is less than ideal.","replies":[]},{"poster":"BarryButcher","date":"2016-08-20T04:11:21.466+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"it'd be cool if it was added to a different mode.\n\nLike Nemesis Draft Ascension. But on its own its kinda whatever. I can play a normal and click random if i wanna play crap.\n\nThey should release a deathmatch mode. Passively gen gold. Kills are worth 0 gold. First team to 100 kills wins.","replies":[]}]}
