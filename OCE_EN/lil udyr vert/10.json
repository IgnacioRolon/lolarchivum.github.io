Its filled with the most unskilled,trolling and shit for brains people and the opposing team is always co-ordinated and stomp. It might seem like im QQing but its ridicilous, i stopped playing for 5 hours to stop the tilt and  i JUST CANT WIN SHIT","replies":[{"poster":"TOXIC Devourer","date":"2015-11-21T14:29:13.472+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":1,"body":"I know bronze is pretty aweful but even a semi decent player will carry games at that elo. I've trolled games as Soraka mid on bronze smurfs and even when trying to lose games still carried games...\n\n Hell one game I was suiciding as karthus but while dying and after death my damage would get our team multiple kills... :/\n\n\n Yes games are bad but if you belong in a higher elo you will get there easily enough unless you are only marginally better than your elo(or worse).","replies":[]},{"poster":"Essembie","date":"2015-11-22T00:41:46.309+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"yoloQ is awful at the moment. I think there are a few things at play here:\n\n1. people say \"its preseason who cares\" and dont put as much commitment into each game.\n2. people probably trying out new champs in pre-season\n3. people still probably getting used to the new items / warding being tested in pre-season\n4. people who want to ranked next season are getting in practice now.\n\n1 pisses me off. 2 I can understand because mostly these guys know basic stuff like map awareness (even though they might struggle early). 3 will pass and happens every year - am guilty of sucking pretty hard in my first few games in tbh - still sucking a bit lol. 4 wouldnt bother me so much if they didnt bring the fucken attitude with them - so many delicate flowers at the moment who rage if you say \"play safe, farm lane and stop feed\" or something similar.\n\nIt is very frustrating trying to play at the moment.","replies":[]},{"poster":"chezwickcheese","date":"2015-12-17T02:58:29.926+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Wait till you hit silver. It is faaaaar worse than bronze. I'm going to stop playing ranked because its making me hate this game. Games should be fun and enjoyable, not a stressful hateful experience. I just recently transferred from NA servers too and its worse here for some reason. My ping is great but my experience so far has not been. That could also be the current patch we're in, which imho is the worst patch this game has seen. Balance is non-existent at the moment. \n","replies":[]},{"poster":"Beer8Tacos","date":"2015-11-23T09:02:15.787+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Ranked isn't worth playing. I find more quitters and ragers there than on norms.

Then when ranked is back next year you should hopefully get into a better bracket. Bronze definitely is the worst to climb out of if you think you've had a good enough time to learn the game.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Kaiyuso","date":"2015-11-22T03:19:02.366+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Quite classic indeed.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Bribery","date":"2015-11-22T01:51:11.184+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"just makes me lol when ppl think they r tilting. i dropped from 300 lp challenger to d5 0 lp in 1 week. lost like 28 our of 30. theres always ppl going thru worse. when ur not having fun just stop playing","replies":[]}]}
