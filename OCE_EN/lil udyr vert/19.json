Currently,I am learning French and to immerse myself more into the language I thought changing my client from English to French,I was looking through the settings and there is no such thing on there regarding that","replies":[{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2018-02-22T12:21:18.361+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You can, a quick google turns up some reasonably easy methods, however it is a do at your own risk kind of scenario since it's not officially supported. If you break your game, you'll probably have to clean reinstall it if you can't remember everything you've changed. It may not work as intended or you might have to try a few methods to find one that works. \n\nI would also recommend not using any 3rd party program to change the language, as they can contain other software than can get your account instant perma banned for cheats. If you use a 3rd party program and it does more than simply change the language of your client you risk your account.","replies":[{"poster":"Lil Udyr Vert","date":"2018-02-23T06:23:55.889+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Just did some research and yeah,all the ways are a bit more complex than I would have imagined. I still think it should be as easy as pressing a button in settings,but eh,we'll see what happens","replies":[{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2018-02-23T09:19:47.418+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"At the moment that's only the case for languages officially supported on a region (which in the case of OCE is only English). To use languages from other regions it's a little more difficult. I don't totally know why, I can only assume it has to do with localisation stuff (stuff individual to each region) since expanding to other languages can be a lot of work.","replies":[]}]}]}]}
