When tapping into the spirits' bestial natures, Udyr can harness their unique strengths: the tiger grants him speed and ferocity, the turtle resilience, the bear might, and the phoenix its eternal flame.","url":"http://leagueoflegends.wikia.com/wiki/Udyr/Background","image":"/api/embedly/1/image/resize?url=http://img1.wikia.nocookie.net/__cb20141114134045/leagueoflegends/images/thumb/f/fa/Udyr_Render.png/250px-Udyr_Render.png&key=a45e967db0914c7fb472fd4381e6c85b&width=425"},"up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"According to the  League of legends wikipedia, Spirit Guard Udyr has 4 different jokes and taunts, one for each of his stances (and I have watched multiple you tube clips where he has 4 jokes/taunts). However, me and my brother both recently got the spirit guard udyr skin, and whenever we joke/taunt the only joke or taunt he says are the bear joke (\"Man I love honey... but bees, ugh) or the bear taunt (\"you'd look better after a good mauling) no matter what stance I'm in.  He also only uses the bear quotes for attacking and movement. He still says the quote for maxing a skill, but still only uses the bear stance quotes for everything else. \r\n\r\nIs anyone else having this problem? I must say I'm a bit disappointed, since it's a legendary skin.
