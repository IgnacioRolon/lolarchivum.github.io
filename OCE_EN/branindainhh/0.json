So far I have three mid-silvers, a jungle main, a support main, and one who can play mid or top. We&#039;ll take people who play anything, though. We&#039;re serious about playing to win but we&#039;re a bit older than average and really not into any kind of bm or nasty in-game behaviour, we want to see if we can find some group synergy and have fun. Add BranindainHH if you&#039;re interested, if you&#039;re a team player you will be welcome regardless of rank.","replies":[{"poster":"HAppY101","date":"2015-06-15T07:31:13.013+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"hey man id love to join I main mid but good with all roles and  other then adc \n\nahri, akili, anivia, ekko(learning atm), fizz, kat, kayle, sona, soraka and zed\n\n\nI too am looking for a dedicated team of mature people to lean from  get better and climb with thanks \nsummoner name :HAppY101","replies":[]},{"poster":"Geuneul","date":"2015-06-14T08:11:17.560+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I am a support main silver 4\n\nJanna, Lulu, Alistar, Zilean, Leona, Shen, Annie and Sona","replies":[]},{"poster":"pax120","date":"2015-06-14T07:03:55.148+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I ll join man i can lenoa sup, hemi mid or top or zilean or blitz","replies":[]},{"poster":"Abyss Pixl","date":"2015-06-13T07:24:48.416+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey, \nI am a jungle main and I play and learn whatever is currently the strongest so I play a large variety of champs, but jungle is taken, which then leaves me to support, but again that is also taken.

I can play pretty much play anywhere except my pool will be limited for mid and top, but I am willing to learn champs for those roles if needed.\n\nI'm really looking for a dedicated team of mature people to learn, get better, climb together and to make some new friends.\nI am currently 17 years old.\nSilver V at the moment but was Silver 1 S4.\nI am available 5 days a week.
