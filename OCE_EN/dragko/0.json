His experience. His epic strats.\n\nHe can still move around as well. He's not some old frail grandpa, he's a grandpa that will shoot to kill and will cut you down by all means necessary.\nRuthless Grandpa Gangplank. Not a nice grandpa. \n\nI think I liked Fiora's look better but I don't want to use that as some sort of fact to impose on people. \nThis one's extremely subjective because they made a new model and everything.\nShe looks bigger and more white-ish. Really different from jet black haired untargetable Fiora.","replies":[]},{"poster":"GigaPube","date":"2015-08-05T18:46:44.356+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"old gp looked too young though, even when i just started playing","replies":[]}]}
