I&#039;m extremely annoyed that i have to wait 20 minutes to get into a game i want to play just because of a bug i cant get around.","replies":[{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2019-01-27T03:38:24.010+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"These kinds of issues are (relatively speaking) common after patches and they occur for a variety of reasons. You might have had a bad connection when you patched or something else interfered with the process causing a bad patch, your ISP might be having trouble with one of their connections, you might have some missing assets that are causing the game to hang.\n\nMy first recommendation would be to try running a **client repair** through settings (the gear icon top right) > Initiate Full Repair, and try updating your graphics card drivers if they aren't up to date, as this can solve *a lot* of issues.\n\nIf that doesn't work try **reinstalling the game** with the [Hextech Repair Tool](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/202539040-Reinstalling-League-of-Legends).\n\nIf that still doesn't fix your issue **submit a ticket** to [Player Support](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/requests/new) and they should be able to help you further.\n\nAs for the Leaver Buster itself, you have to leave a lot of games to hit 20 minute timers. At a point Riot have to start protecting those players whose games you are affecting, since they are the larger population. The LB timer won't be removed, but if you can solve the issue then it should be easy enough to avoid getting any more.","replies":[{"poster":"novastreamer12","date":"2019-01-27T06:27:15.106+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"none of these worked, while i didn't submit a ticket to player support (which i didn't even know existed after playing for YEARS) i found that i had to take issues into my own hands after finding hundreds of the same issue that still has not been fixed, deleting the release folder and letting the game patch....\n\nmost of the strikes i received earlier were over 8 months ago until i experienced this issue again, i don't understand as to why the game went straight to a 20 minutes timer again, i would understand 5 or 10 minutes but for getting a pop up to tell me Ive gotten so much better in game, it really goes to show it (not)\n\ni don't know what to say at this point, im extremely annoyed about everything Ive received from a game that Ive spent hundreds of hours and dollars on to get nothing but annoyance and little to no help or care.","replies":[]}]}]}
