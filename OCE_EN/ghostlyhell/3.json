That's it.\nE - Much faster dashing, 30 base damage per level, ability to cast E again very quickly.\n\nSo theres more benefit maxing E since Q damage gets spiked by building crit anyway whereas you can't increase the damage on Q that much by levelling it up and buying crit as opposed to the mixed damage (since E deals magic) that E can bring along with good damage from critting Qs anyway.","replies":[{"poster":"IlCosmoll","date":"2015-07-03T09:16:14.824+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"THIS!!\nQ scales off items.

Maxing it reduces the time it takes before you can E someone again so it's good for chases. Q is just generally safer much like with Zed.\n\nEvery champ can vary, pointing out a few games and saying \"hah\" you're wrong is silly, it's a guide - not the rules, I just agree with the choice and from experience the better Yasuo's I've vs'd have maxed E in lane and Q in the jungle.\n\nI vary my skill levelling depending on heaps of factors so if you want to learn more about Yasuo I recommend reading the guide on lolpro and maybe some of the strategies and even recommend watching the Champion spotlight as I don't think you'll get a simple yes or no answer on this, but you will get a recommendation for if you are uneducated - on what to do (Ie which skills to level).","replies":[{"poster":"Dawaraven","date":"2015-03-27T03:41:12.977+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"His e has no \"dps\". It cant be used on a single target more than once every 10-6 or so seconds. The q cooldown goes down to about 1.3 once you have 1.4 attack speed. It actually scales with crit/AD, and is AOE.\n\nZeds q has a higher base, scaling, and can hit the target twice, dealing 50% dmg the 2nd time.\n\nZeds e has 2 seconds less cooldown than his q, less base, scaling, and if it hits a target twice it does NO ADDITIONAL DAMAGE.\n\nYasuo can be jungled, but it is kinda bad. I used to jungle jayce and talon, and was excited to jungle yasuo when he was released but it was kinda underwhelming, even on the old jungle.\n\nWhile I am completely open to new ideas, like e max yasuo, q max is simply better, and the OP was asking for which was better.\n\n\"My 2 friends have argued on Yasuo what to max, One says you max E because after the Q nerfs (6/5/4/3/2 CD/L) > (4/4/4/4/4 CD/L).
