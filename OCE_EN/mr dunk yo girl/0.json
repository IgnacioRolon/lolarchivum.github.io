I haven&#039;t had any experience reporting bugs, help a brother out? \r\n\r\nAlso if you&#039;ve noticed this but aren&#039;t entirely sure enough to report it, I&#039;ve noticed it happening across my last 50ish darius games. \r\n\r\nI&#039;ve also heard this only occurs with the dunkmaster skin, I haven&#039;t used any other skins in the last few months so I will try this also. \r\n\r\nHappy Dunking.","replies":[]}
