(don&#039;t wanna ruin it for my homies)\r\nI&#039;ve looked into it and the only option seems to be either losing a ton of games or transferring to a different server and not playing that 1 promotional game\r\n\r\nCan anyone confirm if the second option works at all? Transferring servers and just not playing, that should leave me unranked right?\r\n\r\nThanks in advance","replies":[{"poster":"Gehirn","date":"2015-11-09T01:45:23.370+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey there, if you want a border removed you can request it by sending a ticket in to support:\n\nhttps://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/requests/new","replies":[{"poster":"Zorphiax","date":"2015-11-09T06:15:39.087+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Can I send a request to get a platinum one so I look good for once?","replies":[{"poster":"Chicken4dinner","date":"2015-11-09T07:58:08.140+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Cheeki bugga","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"GigaPube","date":"2015-11-09T10:47:35.162+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"eyyy riots angus is peppered for dis","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Roguestoney","date":"2015-11-09T01:08:25.779+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"They may grant your wish if you send in a support ticket?
