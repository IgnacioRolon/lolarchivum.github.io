To the point it's made intentionally to hold players back from climbing. \nI get the pain though. \nIn gold atm, and theres ALWAYS at least 1-2 afks, who will continue to be able to play and make it harder further on, and thats NOT including the inters. \nTo top it off, rito claim \"there is nothing wrong with the system\" despite multiple claims with evidence that there is. \n\n> Source: Playing the game and observing.","replies":[{"poster":"Nightjar","date":"2019-08-21T02:23:52.711+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"Because the average new player makes it somewhere between bronze 1 to gold 4 within their first 50 ranked games, they are assumed to be within a few standard deviations of the average player.\n\nThis might seem weird, until you factor in alts, returning players, banned players, and players migrating from other MOBAs such as DOTA or HOTs or translating skills from similar games such as Starcraft. Your odds of seeing a fresh faced newbie with 0 applicable game experience nowadays is close to zilch.\n\nAlso everyone has to deal with the same issues and afks and trolls during their ranked journey. Ranks are guaged by MMR, and the only way to win MMR is to take it from other people. The harder the matchup, the more you work to get that MMR, the more you get rewarded with.\n\nThat's how ranked systems work.\n\nI see people complaining about climbing, but climbing is a long term process. It needs time and data from many games to place you where you belong. To reach a higher rank, you need to improve, reflect, adapt, and keep your cool over a large number of games. You'll need around 100 ranked games under your belt before you reach somewhere near your 'true rank' and that's assuming you don't improve along the way.\n\nI'm a gold ranked player. I reach gold 4 in soloq and flexq each season in less than a 100 ranked games. If you belong in an elo, no matter where you start, you'll end up there pretty quickly if you play seriously. Climbing isn't that hard, it just takes alot of time.\n\nThe system works, also, it's best to play ranked at peak times for more balanced matchmaking (OCE is a small server, you play at 3am you get stupid queue times and end up in games with literally any elo, ever seen the difference between a challenger midlaner and a silver one? it's pretty obvious), and not near meal times because some people ditch because hunger.","replies":[{"poster":"Exarch Leona","date":"2019-08-21T05:33:51.646+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":4,"body":"I really can't help but to believe this is bait. \n\nYou've sat there and defended afkers, inters, and trollers half assed, and its concerning. \nLike, why tf would you defend them?","replies":[{"poster":"Nightjar","date":"2019-08-21T12:57:59.465+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"They should be reported, yep, but the overall impact they have on your climb is going to be minimal, since both you, and everyone else, has an equal chance of being forced to play with them.\n\nThey are frustrating yes, but they're not the reason you can't climb.\n\nClimbing in ranked isn't hard if you belong at a certain elo. The system is designed to put you where you belong after enough games, and ever since they relieved clamping, no matter where you start, within a few hundred games, you'll end up near where you belong.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Exarch Leona","date":"2019-08-21T20:43:07.639+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":3,"body":"No idea why people have downvoted facts.\n\nOHWAIT, YES I DO, THEY'RE IN DENIAL.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2019-08-21T10:01:03.582+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":2,"body":"The starting MMR (matchmaking rating) for fresh ranked accounts (each queue has different MMR) is mid-low Silver. A player who is winning all their placements is going to hit that high Silver MMR easily.\n\nLevel isn't everything. A level 30 player with 5 years of DotA experience is generally going to do a lot better than a level 60 player who has never played a MOBA or RTS before, and one game is not a good indicator of skill. Just because they played badly that one game, doesn't mean they belong in Iron, just as you haveing a bad game doesn't mean you don't deserve the rank your rank. \n\nSpeaking from personal experience, I've played some games with and against low plat players that beat mid-Diamonds, and other games where such games go exactly as you would expect. Ultimately there is a reason they are in your game, but if you play off-peak hours you will see more imbalance just by virtue of server size.","replies":[]},{"poster":"LEAGUE IS RPG","date":"2019-08-21T04:07:29.092+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Play ur game as close to perfect as possible u will probably 4v5  in that elo easily","replies":[]}]}
