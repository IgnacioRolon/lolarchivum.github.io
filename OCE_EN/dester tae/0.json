Kayle is in the worst possible state she could be in, needs a buff to her early, and a nerf to her late.","replies":[{"poster":"SOOM","date":"2019-06-25T20:16:28.401+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"thatâ€™s the purpose of the champion... to be the worst early game and best late game champ in the game","replies":[]}]}]}]}
