How about a mercy vote that the enemy team does at the end of a game to help remove/reduce the points lost but the losing team due to an AFK or someone intentionally feeding. The winning team wouldn't lose any points (i.e if they were going to get 30 points, they would get 30 even if the vote passes)\r\n\r\nTell me what you think! \r\nThanks :D","replies":[{"poster":"JasonWazza","date":"2015-03-22T04:52:56.622+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'm gonna say no for the simple reason.\n\nEither everyone should always get mercy, or not get mercy.\n\nIn effect this will turn into, half decent people always vote yes, assholes vote no, vote passes based on how many assholes there are.","replies":[{"poster":"Iosua Bot","date":"2015-03-23T06:27:34.254+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Well then if your an arsehole, dont answer at all, cause im sure they dont hav a life and want to play asap :)","replies":[{"poster":"JasonWazza","date":"2015-03-23T06:52:48.735+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You'd have to force answers for a system like this to even make sense, especially considering most people instantly leave the end game screen.","replies":[{"poster":"Iosua Bot","date":"2015-03-24T03:40:56.690+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yup :) Seriously get them to answer, like when you get a gift and make them open it / get it :)","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Wat U Lookin At","date":"2015-03-23T04:40:32.414+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"That is what I was thinking, however I do think that most people will vote Yes due to them not wanting to be on the other end.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"basíc","date":"2015-03-22T09:57:12.404+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"this game has always had trolls and afkers, if riot was going to do something about it they would have done it by now\n\nthat said, a stat compensation buff for a team with leavers would be nice, +20% minion damage and health for each leaver and bonus stats for champions, or the shop could sell their items for 100-120% value and distribute the gold evenly among the remaining players once they are disconnected for 5-10 minutes, as for a mercy vote, in my experience most ranked players are assholes, I can't even get a report for an intentional feeder half the time, the enemy team would rather honor them for the free win","replies":[{"poster":"Wat U Lookin At","date":"2015-03-23T04:41:24.374+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Selling items for 120% is stupid, You could just buy items then sell them, etc. It would make the game extremely unfair.","replies":[{"poster":"basíc","date":"2015-03-23T05:08:24.565+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"i said the shop would sell the leavers items for 120% and they wouldn't be able to rejoin, dat comprehension","replies":[]}]}]}]}
