This means that what rank you were before your placements plays a large role in where you end up.\n\nThe guy who got Silver 5 was probably High Bronze/Low Silver last season. The guy that got Silver 2 was probably high silver/low gold last season.","replies":[]},{"poster":"DarthVrael","date":"2015-01-22T08:51:50.175+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Where you get placed in ranked now depends more significantly on your previous season MMR and less on your placement matches. If you haven't played ranked in the previous seasons the placement matches will be only factor for where you are placed.\n\nNow to answer your questions MMR between seasons are not reset only the rank is reset between seasons. You're friend must have lower mmr compared to that other guy.\n\nThey are however sometimes adjusted down to the average of the rank you were in previously. So say you have 1050 and the average for the rank you were in last season was 1000, you will be dropped to that 1000.","replies":[]}]}
