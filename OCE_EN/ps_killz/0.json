But it begins to punish players when this behaviour becomes too frequent, like when it happened 4 times in a short period of time.\n\nI know it wasn't intentional, but you're still wasting people's time when you crash. Even if the game ends in a remake, you've still wasted close to 10 minutes of everyone's time (including time spent in champion select etc.)\n\nYou **knew** that there was a clear issue with your PC by the 2nd crash yet you continued to play instead of fixing the issue. Even though your PC crashing isn't you fault, your choice to continue to play is your fault.\n\n__*\n\nWhat you should have done is contact **Riot** or one of the board members about your issues. It's unlikely your punishments will be reversed, but we're definitely able to help you fix your problem! :D\n\n+ [Here](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/sections/200383134-Hardware-Software)'s some troubleshooting posts that you might find handy. \n\n+ You can also contact [**Riot** Player Support](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/requests/new) directly (they'll probably ask you to try the general trouble shooting tips first though).\n\n+ Or if you're looking for a faster response, you could also make a post detailing your issue in the [Help & Support board](http://boards.oce.leagueoflegends.com/en/f/ElA0rvVL).\n\nI know this is quite an unfortunate experience for you, but hopefully we can get you back up and running soon without any crashes ;)","replies":[{"poster":"PS Killz","date":"2016-09-28T07:56:52.822+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Ok I understand it is my fault i decided to still play so ill take responsibility.
