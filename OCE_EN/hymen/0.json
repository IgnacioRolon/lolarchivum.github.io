I come into ranked, and I see people build it on him, and it seems like we almost lose the game right there unless he get&#039;s fed. Kog right now has {{item:3078}}  on his &quot;Essential items,&quot; and it just isn&#039;t essential, while items like {{item:3124}}  are not there. I was just hoping Riot could fix this. It seems like a huge noob trap that I have experienced and has lost me games. I think riot should change this and if not just remove{{item:3078}} from it and not include guinsoos. It&#039;s a hard item to use sometimes.","replies":[{"poster":"SOOM","date":"2018-01-25T05:19:16.216+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Tell me about it... kat still has boots as her recommended starting item ... rito pls","replies":[{"poster":"catch this work","date":"2018-01-31T13:22:40.228+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Kat also has Luden's in there if I'm not mistaken.
