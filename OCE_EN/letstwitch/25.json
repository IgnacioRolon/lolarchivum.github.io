If you didnt you were weaker so you just did, there was no interactivity with the old system.\r\n\r\nThis is a fresh take on what was an obsolete part of the game, merging them with masteries to remove some of the confusion and making them more fun to play around rather than the very basic upgrades from masteries.\r\n\r\nSecondly on runes, it&#039;s been out for a couple days. Lots of problems are arising and **thats the point of PRESEASON**, if by the time next season starts these problems still exist then sure, you can call riot worthless and garbage all you like but they just released a huge revamp and you&#039;re suprised that there are some kinks\r\n\r\n\r\nAnd regarding the posts about how slow BE is achieved, how much have you honestly played and remember from Riot&#039;s perspective. If they overtune this feature they lose revenue, which to you might sound like Rito being greedy bastards but its how the world works, they need money to function.\r\n\r\nSo while it might be slow, until people start reaching atleast ~50 its hard to judge what kind of rewards you get. **And even then it&#039;s still preseason so they might just, you know, increase it?**","replies":[{"poster":"Fitzky","date":"2017-11-08T06:00:11.140+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hopefully they will increase it because that's the point of us complaining about it, if no one says anything then it won't happen","replies":[{"poster":"LetsTwitch","date":"2017-11-08T06:32:34.998+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":2,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Fitzky,realm=OCE,application-id=FjGAIbRv,discussion-id=1heeOVxq,comment-id=0000,timestamp=2017-11-08T06:00:11.140+0000)\n>\n> Hopefully they will increase it because that&#x27;s the point of us complaining about it, if no one says anything then it won&#x27;t happen\n\nIts not about that, its about the people immediately claiming riot ruined league or broke the game.

It added a level of complexity to an already complex game which was a major turn off for new players. I think this was a smart move by riot and long overdue.\n\nThe problem I have with combining IP and RP is that the long grind is an incentive to drop real world $. I've seen this done horribly with dungeon keeper and I just think it is an unethical way for a games company to take advantage of their players, using them as cash cows rather than providing a good experience and having the players give of their own volition. \n\nI've dropped somewhere between 600-1000 on lol (I've lost count and I tell my missus about $400 but that is an underestimation) because I loved the game and was happy to see it develop. but cornering players into a mild pay to play system is treating the players with contempt.","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Nightjar","date":"2017-11-08T10:56:56.869+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Whilst I do think it's reasonable to make players chip in, to ensure league maintains a good revenue flow, and I'm more than willing to buy skins, emotes, icons and cosmetics for the game if I like how they look.\n\nHowever...\n\nI'm left feeling very bitter about the prospect of having to buy a champion with real money. That just feels like we're going too close to the dark depths where paywalls lurk. Some people buy champions with RP if they're impatient, but it was always a core thing, that you could save up IP to buy a champion of your **choice**, and that if you wanted to, you could play for free (and alot of people still think they play for free, whilst spending alot of money on cosmetics).\n\nThe level system looks like a sink of diminishing returns, as xp requirements rise, and it takes longer and longer to earn capsule 'champion fragments' which railroad you into your champion purchase decisions, I ended up spending 2600 BE to unlock skarner today, but I wasn't happy about it in the slightest. Compared to a lunar reveal shop, where I bought leona with rp simply because she was available as a free discount, even though I didn't care for the skin I got with it.\n\nIn the past when I got champion shards from chests, I could choose to purchase, reroll or disenchant, giving me a choice on what to work for, or roll and hope. When I saved up enough IP to finally buy a new champion I wanted, I would hit the rift like a giddy child, excited to learn the champion, see whether I would miraculously be good at the champion or not, and then mess around with itemisation and playstyle, to see what I liked best. \n\nI kinda liked skarner before I got the shard, but I probably won't be playing him any time soon, because critically, I wasn't given much of a **choice** on which champion I wanted next, and looking at him makes me feel bitter about the fact that what i worked so hard to get, didn't give me a **choice** it was take this discount on skarner, or dust it. No option to reroll and an atrocious return rate on BE if I had chose to dust it. It felt bad, and made me stop playing league for the day.\n\nIP gave you choices, you worked for them, and then got to **choose**. Champion Shards had decent enough value, and were nice on the side.\nLevel Capsules, don't give you a choice; if you don't take the discount, then the disenchant refund is so low. \n\nThe new system doesn't make you feel fulfilled when you work towards getting a new champion and being lvl31 looks kind of awkward.","replies":[]}]}
