Besides, there really isn&#039;t a skill difference between Bronze V and IV, everyone is just as shit as before.\r\n\r\nSecondly, I am stomping these guys 70-80% of the bloody time playing support and getting something around 2/4/20 every game. Dominating lane and then trying to carry as best as I can. But with the harsh consequences for losing even one game in 5 heavily outweigh the rewards for winning the other 4.\r\n\r\nHonestly, it&#039;s like Riot expect me to solo carry a team that may or may not be full of feeders / afkers **when I&#039;m bronze...** I have bad games every so often and sometimes I just cant keep us in the fight but it&#039;s nowhere near how many times I do make the comeback for the team and get everyone caught up and pushing and yet I&#039;m not climbing.\r\n\r\nLook, if I&#039;m winning 70%+ of my games.

The problem is you aren't. Your ranked record is 72-82 so you actually have a 47% win rate.\n\nOnce you get closer to a 55% winrate TOTAL for the season, then you will find climbing is easier and losses aren't as harsh.\n\nRight now, I personally have a 15-12 record. Not that great, but its a 55% winrate. I am getting +20-25 for wins and only losing 10-15 when I lose.","replies":[{"poster":"LetsTwitch","date":"2016-03-13T07:57:28.215+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Since I've started trying to climb its been 70% win rate.

If you can actually keep a 70% winrate going (and its not just a lucky streak) you will start winning alot more points than you lose soon enough. It will take a while to get your mmr back up and 'undo' your bad record from earlier in the season. If you keep that going for another 20 or 30 games you will probably start seeing +25 for wins and -15 for losses and be out of bronze in no time.","replies":[]},{"poster":"JasonWazza","date":"2016-03-13T10:59:08.622+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Just ignore the MMR/LP and play to improve, if you do your rank will improve before you know it, but you have to improve yourself.","replies":[]},{"poster":"BarryButcher","date":"2016-03-13T08:40:13.997+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Basically.\n\nYour wins/losses determine your MMR (match making rating). your MMR means EVERYTHING. It decides what level of game you play, how many points you will win and lose after a game.\n\ne.g. You can't go 0-20, then win 10 in a row and expect the game to let you climb.

Like, WAY low. Although we don't know how it actually works, I think if you keep doing well like you have been for the past 20 games, hopefully it will get better. \n\n>I am stomping these guys 70-80% of the bloody time playing support and getting something around 2/4/20 every game.\n\nYes, you are doing really well. If you keep doing well and not give up, you will get out of bronze quickly\n\n>Dominating lane and then trying to carry as best as I can. But with the harsh consequences for losing even one game in 5 heavily outweigh the rewards for winning the other 4.\n\nIf you keep up a win 4 lose 1 pattern, you will start seeing gains of 20+ lp and losses of much less.\n\n> Honestly, it's like Riot expect me to solo carry a team that may or may not be full of feeders / afkers when I'm bronze...\n\nJoin a premade team. \nLow bronze is the ultimate cesspit for trolls and people who play like bots. Playing ranked is like dipping your hand into medical waste and hoping you don't get hepatitis. Playing as a ranked 5 will definitely lessen your chances of being matched with trollers/afks/other toxins. It also allows you to become familiar with the play patterns of your teammates (so you don't have to keep adjusting your style every game) and you have way better communication. With the implementation of a dynamic queue where this is possible, there is literally no reason not to. You also get lots of cool bonuses like extra IP, mastery points and Hextech stuff (soon™).\n\n(Riot are throwing incentives at you to match up with four friends to play and climb together, they aren't expecting you to solo carry)\n\n> Look, if I'm winning 70%+ of my games. I should climb\n\nLike BarryButcher pointed out, you aren't winning 70+% of your games. You currently have a win rate of 47%. Your past 20 games have a win rate of 75%. I didn't have to go far to find a 15ish game losing streak.\n\nHowever, as I keep saying, if you keep up how you are going the past 20 games, you should improve your winrate and lp gains, making it easy to climb.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Aidan7787","date":"2016-03-13T06:37:47.008+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"if you win 3 games and are only on 26 lp then you elo must be well below bronze 4...\nIf you were actually at bronze 4 you would go up 20 and down 20","replies":[]}]}
