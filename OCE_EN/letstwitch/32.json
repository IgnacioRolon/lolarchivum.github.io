Would the damage be insane or does it scale worse as the damage grows.\n\nAny other ideas to extend the distance would be cool.\n\nEDIT: People say this doesnt work anymore as it's from where she threw the spear. I've looked around and still find people talking about this in 2014-2015.","replies":[{"poster":"Talwyn","date":"2016-03-18T21:06:42.691+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey,\nFlashing/grabbing the lantern etc, would have no effect on the damage, as it is calculated from where she stood when she threw the spear, this however is an interesting idea, and could lead to many interesting plays.\n\nYours sincerely,\nTalwyn","replies":[]},{"poster":"JasonWazza","date":"2016-03-20T03:24:51.581+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Even if it did work like that\n\n>which after traveling a minimum distance is increased by「 1% per 3.875 」units traveled, capping at 200% bonus damage.\n\nUnfortunately there is a cap.\n\nAnd it hit's the cap at 1300 range (her spear is a 1500 range projectile.)","replies":[]},{"poster":"GigaPube","date":"2016-03-18T14:22:22.796+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"LOL nice try m8. letstwitch with the cheesy strats","replies":[]},{"poster":"Lord Kylar Alice","date":"2016-03-18T12:14:45.250+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It's the distance from where she threw the spear to where it hits a target.
