The sustain I normally get from W passive was critical in having any decent trades and with that completely removed, her clear is worse and her fighting is awful. A nerf to base armor is huge because now I can&#039;t do anything early game and with marks spawning in enemy jungle, I need to be able to contest them if people turn up but I found myself getting destroyed and doing little damage because of it.\r\n\r\nAssuming that once I got BotRK I would be able to do some good for the team and despite a fairly decent 1/1/2 score I still couldn&#039;t survive in fights and was decimated.\r\n\r\nWhat do I change to make Kindred viable or is she now basically useless.","replies":[{"poster":"Big Waste","date":"2017-03-14T08:24:46.754+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Not sure if there have been any buffs since this post as it was 9months ago but I have only ever played against one other Kindred which shows how much people do not play them. I started adc with them and did ok but I recently started jg with them and did poorly but just learnt how to use the champ and tricks and now I feel like I can clean up, I barely even tank out unless needed.\n\n18/12/0 masteries running Fervor. 3x AS quints. Full AD marks. Full Armour seals. Full MR glyphs.\n\nCore build is Enchantment bloodrazor, beserkers grieves. Starting Machete and refillable potion. From there depending on the game I'll build either cleaver or banshee. Then bloodthirster and either lord Dominick's regards or Mortal reminder depending on how tanky the other team is. And then something like serrated dirk.\n\nEnchantment bloodrazor, beserkers, cleaver, bloodthirster, mortal reminder, and serrated dirk I find absolutely chew through the enemy team. \n\nUsually hit red, wolves, then depending of mark is by blue I'll get Mark, then blue then gank. Or if mark is by red after you've hit wolves I'll gank mid on way to mark then back up gank again, blue, top gank if they're pushing then focus on marks as soon as they come up, ganking as I make my way around the map getting marks on champs.\n\nHave gotten Quadra kill and S- grade with an 18/7/17 KDA using this technique. The trick is knowing how and when to ult, and escape tactics, always know where how to escape if you are getting enemy camp jg. Using your Q to flip away and gain that extra gap and E  for slows. Q is also good to flip over walls and utilise bombs in jg where possible. Combine that with your ult and flash and you should be able to escape most deaths.\n\nHope this helps, add me in game if ya want any more advice (mrhelms)","replies":[]},{"poster":"JasonWazza","date":"2016-06-29T13:20:21.702+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'd honestly say she is probably just useless, the changes are brutal to a kindred.\n\nHonestly the best build i think there would be would be the old Tank jungle Marksman from the Marksman rework ({{item:3139}} {{item:3053}} )\n\nThough honestly i haven't played her and don't plan on playing her in her current state.","replies":[{"poster":"LetsTwitch","date":"2016-06-29T14:04:58.749+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yeah and they ruined any chance of her laning as well, I don't know why the nerfs were so huge.
