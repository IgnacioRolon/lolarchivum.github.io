When I play with my friend as support the game becomes a joke with how easy it is but on my own in solo queue having a good support let alone coordination is a rare sight.\r\n\r\nNeeds to have a mic and be willing to improve","replies":[{"poster":"RedNalick","date":"2016-08-11T00:00:26.484+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Just a tip, it seems that you die a lot in your games. One thing to get out of Bronze is to become less greedy and more careful. Although making plays is important dying means a lot more in Season 6. Try dying less.","replies":[]},{"poster":"RedNalick","date":"2016-08-10T00:54:26.650+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I am sorry dude but If you are in Bronze 5 you really won't get anyone playing with you. You are only in bronze 5 because that's were you deserve to be so improve then come back to the boards.","replies":[{"poster":"LetsTwitch","date":"2016-08-10T10:48:00.020+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Sorry bro my teemo support against ezreal and sona is here to disagree with you\n\n\"Not only will I not buy my gold item, I will play a champ with basically no purpose in this matchup. Forgo any defensive stats, utility stats or even damage stats, just to play teemo.\"\n\nOr my illaoi support who went dorans + infinity edge\n\n\"I dont need to do anything here, I just sit and wait for gold to come in so I can have 2 items at 30 minutes\"\n\nOr the Thresh who left me to 2v1 because\n\n\"I hate Ezreal he is a trash champ who does no damage learn the game and stop playing such awful champs\"\n\nDespite that I was almost 2 thousand gold ahead of their draven and was short 1 or 2 shots in winning the 2v1.\n\nPerhaps you would like to meet the rest of the team.\n\nLike the 0/8 fiora at 10 minutes?\n\nOr the 2/10 xin at 15 minutes?\n\nOr the Ryze that flamed them both the whole game?\n\nOr the game before?\n\nThe 3/10 kindred jg\n\nOr the game before that?\n\nThe 1/8 darius and the team that refused to go try and engage until they were on nexus\n\nMore examples you beg?\n\nThe team where everyone went at most 4/12 and I had the lovely job of being the squishy adc that nobody has a clue how to protect and I have to rely on my own positioning to do anything useful without being immediately destroyed.\n\nYou say I deserve to be in Bronze 5 and yet the enemy adc is never the problem. The 10/2 assassin is, or the 10/2 bruiser. You know who's problem they are in teamfights? Mine. I have to deal with them because if I don't I will get one shot so my challenge every game is not to go even in lane. Its to crush the lane so convincingly that the 10/2 assassin/bruiser can't get near me\n\nCan you guess now why I want someone to communicate with, in the hopes that maybe I can have atleast one useful teammate in every game?","replies":[{"poster":"RedNalick","date":"2016-08-10T23:57:40.722+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Your going to have people like that all the time. Check my op.gg page and u can see I was b5 beginning of the season. I belonged in b5 because I truly was bad. Now I have improved and I am in silver 4.
