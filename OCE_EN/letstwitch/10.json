The game was literally over from the start and I cant even open mid so I don't waste my time. Was I supposed to just sit in lane and farm as Janna, running away as soon as someone showed their face or else I die? I am being punished for some stupid fucks wasting my time and fucking up not only my rank, but my mmr.\n\nand then just for shits and giggles you throw on an afk ban.\n\n\nEDIT: I just checked the Garen's page and guess what, he's unranked and inting every game in his placements.\n\n1/24/4\n0/11/1\n1/12/0\n1/11/0\n0/20/2\n1/28/1\n0/13/0\n0/11/0\n0/19/0\n0/6/0\n\nFinished placements silver 3\n\nBefore that? No games. How can your system not detect that, but instantly ban me for being afk maybe 3 minutes?
