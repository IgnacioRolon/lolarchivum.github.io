But it is middle range so it&#039;s what most people would have.\r\n\r\nI queue up for ranked and get into lobby, on the second ban the game bugsplats but then immediately reopens to the lobby screen except its resolution is wrong and the textures are messed up. I click lock in because its my pick and it comes up with &quot;There was a problem locking in your champion&quot;. I then dodge the game ( lose 10 goddamn LP and have to wait 30 minutes thanks Rito u twats) not on purpose but because the client is now unresponsive. It shoves me back into the lobby with a copy of myself as a second player with my roles. The name and summoner icon on the player I CAN CONTROL is missing and I cant kick the extra me.\r\n\r\nClient then crashes fully and i have a Queue dodge timer + lost LP\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat the fuck? Why is this not detectable by their system, especially the error message with locking in my champ, clearly it wasnt my fault I dodged so why cant it detect that message appearing and remove the punishment.\r\n\r\n(Reported the bug on their website.)","replies":[{"poster":"crackshot ","date":"2017-01-28T10:25:39.368+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"i've had similar experience without the res change or crash, just sometimes client wont let me pick a champion because they have disappeared with a splash screen stuck over the top, so you just push lock in is your only option. (sometimes locking wont even work and u get booted , + cd timer if it happens a lot ) \nother times i just get the message \"There was a problem locking in your champion\".","replies":[]},{"poster":"Kürama","date":"2017-01-27T05:20:08.635+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Rid yourself of the pests which harass your gameplay by using the [Bug & Crash Exterminator.](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201761974-Bug-Splat-and-Game-Crashes) Kha’Zix and Elise won’t know what hit ‘em.\n\nhttp://na.leagueoflegends.com/sites/default/files/styles/scale_xlarge/public/upload/khazix_deathblossom_splash_1920x1080.jpg?itok=re5tY9ln https://static.lolwallpapers.net/2014/12/Death-Blossom-Elise.jpg","replies":[]}]}
