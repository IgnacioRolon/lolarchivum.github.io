I then lost 20 lp for this. How do I carry this shit, please explain to me how I'm supposed to win this game by myself because I don't know.\r\n\r\nOr the game before where I had a troll adc (picked someone they had never played) in ranked, who then _probably_ accidentally fed. Then our mid laner left. Once again, as hard as I try and as fed as I get. Being down two players makes it really bloody hard.\r\n\r\nOr the jax adc, or the illaoi adc, or the nasus mid lane.\r\n\r\nNow I know the response I'm likely to get, \"Learn To Carry\" Well I'm sorry, I'm not good enough for platinum or gold. So it's bloody difficult for me to solo carry a team. But I am good enough for silver, and I ask you how many silvers you see that could carry a bad team. I just want to be able to reach the point where everyone is of equal skill and I dont have to feel like I'm 1-3 vs 5 in most games.","replies":[{"poster":"Ing√©nue","date":"2016-02-14T03:05:34.933+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"The easiest way to avoid trolls is to get into a premade 5man team. That way, you know the people you are playing with and they are less likely to troll. Riot are basically pushing incentives into our faces to try and get this to happen. Look at the increased ip, champion mastery and even the introduction of a dynamic ranked que.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2016-02-14T02:32:28.948+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Intentionally feeding, trolling etc is a reportable and punishable offense, so please do report them in post game so the system can pick them up. Sometimes someone will have a bad game and not do very well, but it's usually pretty obvious if they're trying or not, just don't abuse them for bad scores.\n\nOf course trolls exist, and they exist in every tier, but we can't affect the behaviour of others unless they let us, so the only thing you can really do is report them, refuse to engage them if they are actively trolling/feeding/abusing etc, and focus on improving your own gameplay. \n\nYou can't win every game, and it's guaranteed you'll come across a few of those people every now and again, but you are the only constant in your games, so you are the only factor you have any real control over.\n\nIt's unfortunate, and don't mistake this as me telling you to \"git gud\" cause I'm not. I only mean that you can't stop them from doing what they're doing, only encourage them to do so, but you can work on becoming a better player yourself.","replies":[{"poster":"Volcanuz","date":"2016-02-14T15:19:31.715+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yeah but 0/5 sounds just like a bad game or the players were newer to ranked. I report for feeding all the time but never if i can see they are just having a bad game. The report feeding function is for people who perposly run into towers or champs and do nothing and let them kill them.\n\nThey need an actual \"Trolling\" report function. Actually i think they do have one i am not 100% sure now i think about it..","replies":[{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2016-02-15T08:02:11.483+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It comes under \"unsportsmanlike behaviour\" (it's intentionally pretty broad). It's best if you can put comments on the report too, especially if its in game behaviour and not in chat logs since the system has more trouble identifying it, and if you put comments in it helps immensely.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"CHEESYLEEKS","date":"2016-02-14T03:53:21.198+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"just try and move on from that specific game best you can, a good majority of my ranked losses( about 60-70%) were due to afk's or trolls or a combination, theres not much you can do. i had a 5 games in a row were we had an afk or a troll, right after promos too.","replies":[]}]}
