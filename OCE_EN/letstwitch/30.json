We have faster coverage on the map to get to team mates that need help if they are getting rekt in lane phase as an example.\nWe do run duo adc-supp, but if 2 of our other lanes fail, it is alot harder for us to cross map to assist our team members and commonly results in loss of cs etc and only puts us behind also.\nI guess i'm just saying that i found a similar issue as you do, just had to put some brain time into how I could work around preventing a loss if I get a troll or feeder on my team. I found that a duo being centred map was best way to go, if u get a troll or feeder you at least are in a position to get at their lane fast also a chance to use them as a \"bait\" so you and your duo partner can get a chance to become fed and a shot at victory.\nIt dont always work out, but i try!","replies":[]},{"poster":"LevvyLeviticus","date":"2017-09-02T21:20:14.947+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"what rank were you going to be?","replies":[]}]}
