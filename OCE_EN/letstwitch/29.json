Low population times my ass. I play Sunday midday to afternoon and thats a low pop time in fucking bronze.\r\n\r\nEvery day during weekday from 4:30 to 9:30\r\n\r\nI dont want to fucking play support so I dont pick it.\r\n\r\nWasnt even a shorter queue I waited 30 minutes to get support like wtf? Why would I ever want that.\r\n\r\nForcing me into something and I&#039;m gonna give **zero** fucks that game and 99% of the time lose because I dont want to play the game.\r\n\r\nNot only that but dodging is a fucking pain and doesnt even fix the problem.\r\n\r\nInstead of fixing your shithouse role you just shove it down everyones throats and expect us to sick your dick.\r\n\r\nI played in S4 and S5 and I didnt mind playing support if I was last pick because there was no other option especially because it was a 1 in 5 chance. Now you give us the option to choose and then give us a feature that basically guarantees support and always fucking have it on. Dont show me the light then turn it off again, I never even complained about queue times other than the odd &quot;Gee this is a bit long&quot; after 30 mins with my friends\r\n\r\nProblem is queue times havent changed for me but now I get support.\r\nMaybe its better in Diamond+ or wherever but I can&#039;t be the only one with this crap","replies":[{"poster":"Dark Warrior","date":"2016-09-15T03:49:21.046+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"go learn how to play support with bots--->normal---> then auto fill doesn't matter for rank games (Simple solution)","replies":[]},{"poster":"fattyhotdogs","date":"2016-09-16T03:22:16.093+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I've never once been auto filled to something I didn't pick.

I am a top/mid/jg main but i dont mind playing support. Morgana is a really fun support because you only have to build 2 actual support items and then you can go full ap. and its really ghee bc she actually does quite a bit of dmg with her ultimate not to mention the stun on it. ANother fun support is Kayle and Blitzcrank. Dw about it man just learn some fun supporty roles ;)","replies":[]}]}
