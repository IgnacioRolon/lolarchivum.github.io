I accept that I have to carry people who are bad and that&#039;s fine I just hate failing to carry those who dont care. Literally every game I lose is people playing ranked but not caring whether they win or lose because of some stupid reason like &quot;I dont want so and so to win&quot; or &quot;It&#039;s just a game I want to have fun&quot;\r\n\r\nThis shit needs to stay in norms or better yet out of the game all together, nobody has fun going 0/20 and being useless or AFK&#039;ing over some petty dispute. I wish the report and ban system was faster to get some of this cancer out of matchmaking.\r\n\r\nI have heard however that this is actually a bigger problem in OCE than any other region and I just pray that either I can carry enough games to get out of this elo or Riot becomes faster in their banning and more thorough.","replies":[{"poster":"Positivity 4 OCE","date":"2016-07-09T04:11:32.285+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"@LetsTwitch!\n\nI think it is all about perspective. I understand and agree that the game is a lot more fun and enjoyable when you win and want to win all the time but the player that truly climbs is the player that can have a wide perspective on each game that he/she plays. \n\nThe player that climbs is always focusing on themselves, staying in the moment and their improvement in the game. Sometimes it is the rest of the team that loses the game for you or one players individual play that lost the game but that is how the team game works. If you do lose a game always looking back and thinking where you could have gone better or if you did this etc would it of helped this person to play better and help us win the game?\n\nIn all regions they have very similar problems that the community has come to face but it is about you as a individual and how you handle those issues that will make you a better player. \n\nFinding a buddy to play ranked with is also more beneficial as you can share thoughts and talk to them on how you can win the game. Together you can also spot individual flaws and give recommendations on what to do next time and this will also help in self improvement. \n\nAt the end of the day. Be true to yourself, stay in the moment and focus on your improvement!","replies":[]},{"poster":"kaboomblah","date":"2016-07-07T02:32:50.396+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Having never been in Bronze because I got placed Silver V from the get-go,I can't speak from experience, but having watched many Youtube videos, OMG, good luck climbing. Like, what is wrong with your division?\n\nYou and your kin are mysteriously inept when it comes to playing this game. So much so that there is endless content on YouTube illustrating this. Look up Bronze Moments on Youtube. \n\nI think Bronze division is reserved purely for those who just lack gamer's intuition and are not actually meant to be any other division.\n\nYou've had 500+ games and you're still Bronze. Let climbing go. It's a pipe dream. Just enjoy the game.\n\nYou actually buy pink wards though. That is one thing I commend you on.\n\nBut you average 7.8 deaths game. What in the world is that? How do you get there? 7.8 deaths per game! How egregious.\n\nYou have high kills and high deaths. I'm guessing you're good at getting kills - against other Bronzies so it's not saying much - and get many kills, only to donate shutdown gold constantly.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Slowdownn","date":"2016-07-07T00:38:28.265+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I have the same feelings too! Playing solo is like making up the numbers and the odds are always against you. The match up and scoring system has make it very unfair to solo players especially in the lower tiers. I have given up on solo ranked and I guess some people who have also given up climbing will not mind mucking up others as their pleasure.","replies":[]},{"poster":"SlipperyMoose96","date":"2016-07-06T21:10:07.767+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I have had the same problem that is why i have tried to get all the people in my moose club who are like minded like you and me. I haven't been able to on for games as much as i would have liked recently but i have just recently managed to get back to bronze IV after winning like 8 consecutive games and hope to climb even higher.","replies":[]}]}
