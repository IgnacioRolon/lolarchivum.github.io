I don&#039;t want to play/I can&#039;t play it very well and combining those two means I&#039;m probably gonna lose the game and not even enjoy any of it.\n\nThanks Riot, I really want to be forced to play the role I intentionally dont pick just because otherwise, it makes queue times longer. News flash, I dont give a shite if it takes 20 minutes for me to find a game so long as I get the bloody roles that I wanted rather than wait 5 and get something that is gonna piss me off for the next 40.\n\nOh wait, **I CANT EVEN LEAVE THE LOBBY WHEN I GET SUPPORT BECAUSE THEN I HAVE TO WAIT 30 MINUTES TO GET RID OF THE QUEUE DODGE, HOW FUCKING FANTASTIC, I DODGE BECAUSE I KNOW ITS GONNA BE A LOSS AND AN AWFUL EXPERIENCE FOR ME AND THE TEAM AND I GET PUNISHED.**\n\n**I DONT FUCKING PUT SUPPORT OR ANY OTHER ROLE I DONT PICK FOR A GODDAMN REASON. THATS THE WHOLE BLOODY POINT OF DQ WHY THE HELL ARE YOU PULLING THIS SHIT.**\n\nSeriously, add an option so I can opt out of it and not have to wait 30 minutes in the hopes that next lobby I will get a role I like/can play.","replies":[{"poster":"Vanilla Bread","date":"2016-06-28T16:40:21.259+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":6,"body":"are u fucking kidding? Holy shit Auto fill is basically support, you should of known that, its typically the least mained roll out there. Stop fucking complaining on the boards.

Since I'm a support main I got my preference 6 times in a row and as such I was never sure if autofill was on. Maybe it can give you your preference in some situations (eg if you want support) but I'm not sure.

Riot should have catered the system so main/off = 60/40 or 70/30 , instead it turned into 0/100 or 10/90 if you picked support as the off role. Eventually everyone that off roled support got sick of only playing support and stopped queing for that position , this turned into a spiral and now theres a serious lack of support players.","replies":[]}]}
