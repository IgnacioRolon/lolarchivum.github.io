Any time a Yi gets rolling, the surrender is up and most of the team is calling gg and giving up all hope of winning what they think is an impossible game and when you think that it&#039;s impossible it becomes impossible.\r\n\r\nProblem is, even if you have a great comp to beat a master yi, with lots of hard cc and burst, he still manages to always be left unchecked because people attempt to run from him or have wasted their abilities on someone else despite me asking them to save it for yi because he&#039;s gonna roll all over us if we don&#039;t.\r\n\r\nSeriously, how do I stop the pain train that is Master Yi?","replies":[{"poster":"RUSTYtheCASTER","date":"2016-04-15T04:18:10.307+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"What Yaia said sums up my intiial thoughts well enough, but in the instance that you are unable to ban the champion then counter measures must be put in place!\n\n1. Invading - deny as many levels and stacks as possible early with aggressive junglers! (If you're not jungling disregard this)\n2. Fun fact - Fiddlesticks/Fears make him walk away at supersonic speeds, it's a niche suggestion but opposed to the regular champion, when Yi is feared.. He sprints away.\n3. Directing the flow of teamfights through planning. If your goal in a fight is to take down the Yi, make sure your team is aware of this fact! Tell them you'll stun the Master Yi as an example and let them work around that fact.\n4. If you're the carry of your team, and none of the above work, you can consider a Sterak's Gage in your build {{item:3053}} , Guardian Angel {{item:3026}}  is ok as an item but you usually run into the risk of being immediately re-killed, but you deny him Alpha Strike resets. If you have a team with protection for you, this could be a good idea!\n\nMost importantly, remain positive! Mastery Yi players all think with a very similar mindset, if your team is starting to feel negative about him getting 2 kills, try and keep the vibes good and keep your team going. He is a squishy champion that can still lose his team the game with a single mistake!","replies":[]},{"poster":"IngÃ©nue","date":"2016-04-15T01:52:06.921+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Ban him. In bronze and silver, you shouldn't bother with the bans that are in pro-play. You should always be thinking \"what do people my level fail at defeating?\". Yi, Darius\nYou should also ask yourself \"what do people at my level think are OP but don't have the mechanical skill to pull off\", and ban things like yasuo, zed and vayne.\n\nYou can of course focus on the [devourer denial](http://boards.oce.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/gameplay-strategy/QuYjNOx2-how-to-build-vs-a-devourer-build-jungler), but it can be pretty difficult depending on a variety of factors (your own skills, how independent team is, etc).\n\nThe easiest options are definitely the ban or asking your team nicely to focus yi (but a lot of the time the won't listen or will accidentally unload their full combos on someone that is less of a threat).","replies":[]},{"poster":"Roguestoney","date":"2016-04-14T23:02:29.931+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"Polymorph","replies":[]},{"poster":"Main Line","date":"2016-04-15T14:44:29.599+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=LetsTwitch,realm=OCE,application-id=FjGAIbRv,discussion-id=Kb8Zvzmy,comment-id=,timestamp=2016-04-14T16:51:13.487+0000)\n>\n> Playing adc....\n> \n> Problem is, even if you have a great comp to beat a master yi, with lots of hard cc and burst, he still manages to always be left unchecked because people attempt to run from him or have wasted their abilities on someone else despite me asking them to save it for yi because he&amp;#039;s gonna roll all over us if we don&amp;#039;t.\n> \n> Seriously, how do I stop the pain train that is Master Yi?\n\nYou have to convince your noob team that the adc needs to be protected because they are supposedly the carry. It's a tricky job at lower elos, because everyone thinks they are the damage doers, so perhaps at the start of the game suggest it softly to your team like \"hey guys if you can save your cc....\" etc. Basically before the minions spawn.
