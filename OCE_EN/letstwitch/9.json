Our team was managing to just win teamfights and it was pretty close, when I open the client back up (If the main game crashes it wont reconnect for whatever reason and I have to restart the client), I find there is an update.\r\n\r\nBy the time it finishes the game is over and I now have 5 low-priority games.\r\n\r\nAny solution?","replies":[{"poster":"SephirothSG","date":"2016-01-16T04:03:50.996+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey there,\n\nSorry to hear you were unable to reconnect to your game due to the hotfix being released after you crashed, unfortunately Leaverbuster punishments cannot be removed manually as the system is automated. \n\nHowever it sounds to me like you may have left multiple games recently, leaverbuster normally won't punish for simply leaving one game, please see the [Leaverbuster FAQ](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752714-LeaverBuster-FAQ) for more information.","replies":[{"poster":"LetsTwitch","date":"2016-01-16T12:49:28.765+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It was the last of another set of low-priority queues that this happened. The first set was legitimate but it is frustrating to be immediately put on more for something I cant control","replies":[]}]}]}
