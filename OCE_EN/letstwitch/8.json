A lot of assassins in this respect when they get fed are able to do things similar to this. An example would be an Akali, if she gets fed enough she can also 1v2 or 1v3 a fight is she outplays her opponents correctly.\n\n---\n\nHowever I do agree with you that Rengar can be an annoying champion to vs, however he isn't without counterplay and Riot has talked about how is a difficult champion to balance. **Let me comment about the counterplay thing first.**\n\nOne of the main thing that will destroy a Rengar is your team grouping and peeling for the targets he wants to kill. If he wants to go for your ADC for example, make sure you stick with them and make your team group around them in the mid game. If you are able to layer your CC correctly you should be able to peel him off of his targets. To clarify a bit more, when you are using your CC on him, make sure that you don't use everything at once, but layer them one after the other so that one, he can't remove more than 1 stun at once, and 2 the duration from one stun extends into the next.\n\n---\n\n**Along with this there are a lot of items that you can buy to help against a Rengar.** When I am vsing a Rengar as an ADC main I often like to pick up a Randuin's Omen to give me the armor and health to survive his burst combo and the active to help slow him down once he gets on top of me. Otherwise I could always look to pick up a GA so that if he is able to kill me I will revive within the next few seconds to be able to do damage again.\n\nSupports for example can also build things that will buff and help protect their ADC. A shield from Locket will help survive an extra bit of damage, Redemption if timed right will give them a heal to help survive and maybe a Face of the Mountain for more shields. Spell Thief's Edge active can also be very useful for finding out which direction he is coming from.\n\n---\n\n**Now onto what Riot has said about the balance state of Rengar.**\n\nRiot at PAX Australia 2016 had a panel titled [\"The Top 5 Pain in the Ass Champions to Balance\"](https://www.twitch.tv/pax2/v/100188744?t=07m41s) and one of the champions in question that they did a talk on was, you guess it Rengar. They talked about with the type of champion Rengar is, how it is difficult to balance him around the different elos that are in the game and gave a bit of insight into how they go about balancing him and the difficulties that come with it. If you are interested in finding out a bit more about how Riot balances champions I would defs suggest giving it a watch.\n\nOther than that recently Riot did a [QandA with Riot Ghostcrawler](https://www.twitch.tv/leagueoflegends/v/115923219?t=01h25m26s) and one of the questions asked was about Rengar and his balance state. If you are interested in what they had to say I would check that out as well, they spend about 2 minutes talking about the question and state that PBE changes for Rengar should be coming out soon to address some of the issues that he has.\n\n----\n\nAll up I hope this information helps give a bit of insight as to why Rengar is the way he is and helps you counter him in your games. If there is anything I can clarify on or any other questions I can answer let me know. Good luck in your games!\n\n~Elam","replies":[{"poster":"Talon12","date":"2017-01-22T05:09:15.402+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=LGC Elam,realm=OCE,application-id=FjGAIbRv,discussion-id=wEGImEON,comment-id=0001,timestamp=2017-01-22T02:03:50.751+0000)\n>\n>classed as an assassin and as such being able to kill squishy targets\n>\n\nI mean, that would be great and all... If talon didn't get killed, trodden, gangbanged, respawned, then gangbanged again in the time it takes his w to finish its casting, by which time the target is relaxing by the pool so the attack will miss anyway.","replies":[]}]}]}
