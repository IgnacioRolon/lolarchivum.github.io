I spend hours trying to improve my gameplay to the point where I get really good performances most of the time and often get an S but I still cant climb. I focus objectives and make calls for baron when we have a good chance. I try to give everyone advice and snowball lanes by ganking after I get my towers. I try to have huge CS advantages and be ahead of everyone in the game but I still can&#039;t get out of Bronze.\r\n\r\nMy 3 most recent games all had an afk or feeder who ignore everything I say and straight up flame me for it. I do well in lane and as ADC start to do some damage but by that time, say, there is a 6/0 leblanc from a mid laner who refuses to play safe, itemize for the situation or even let us know when leblanc leaves lane.\r\n\r\nI start being useless in fights because I cant hold up against so much damage, effectively a one shot from lb and my good score turns negative. I avoid team fighting because we cannot win and try to farm and split push as hard as I can to try and get past her snowball and catch up a bit. I tell the team my reasoning but they still force fights outside of tower without me and lose but blame it on my lack of teamwork. So eventually I go into the team fight and we start to pick off their weaker plays but leblanc comes through and one shots me and suddenly the team fight goes horribly wrong and we lose.\r\n\r\nAnother game I managed to get an S+ on Caitlyn, the only one doing well other than my support but we have an afk and whilst we come close losing our Ahri and having swain on a free lane just proved too much especially with a top that is having a bad game so we /ff even though I wanted to stay.\r\n\r\nWhy am I matched with these people so often, I wouldn&#039;t care too much if it was once every 3 games but 3 in a row is awful because now I&#039;ve dropped a rank and have to climb again.\r\n\r\nI understand your response is &quot;carry harder&quot; or &quot;you&#039;re bronze, you&#039;re not good&quot; but seriously, I can&#039;t deal with this anymore. What can I do.","replies":[{"poster":"Crunch","date":"2016-06-20T03:44:28.433+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"ADC is a hard role to try and climb out with as you don't have as much influence on the game in the early/mid game which is considered the snowball period. It also relies on your team a lot more than other roles, so in lower ranks it can be a very frustrating role to play. HOWEVER, that is not a valid excuse for NOT climbing as it is just harder, not impossible. If you feel you need help from your team more, communicate it in a NICE WAY. Give logic and avoid being passive aggressive. \n\"I'm really strong, make sure to just keep Fizz off me, hes the only one that can kill me!\" Tells your allies that you have faith in yourself to perform and its given them a SPECIFIC condition which you've identified. Rather than just \"peel me\". \n\nI mentioned this in a previous post, and its an amazing way to improve your gameplay especially in lower ranks. \n\n> One thing I see far too often when coaching players is how they act when they are ahead. If you have a lot of kills and are on a champion which can snowball, then usually this indicates you have great mechanical prowess and micro play relative to your level, but your macro-gameplay or general strategy and decision making may be holding you back. \n\nIf you find that you are typically leading in kills or winning your lane but still consistently losing games then you need to focus on improving your teamwork and learning win conditions. Do not continually blame your team on this front, as they may be losing lane but have the skills needed for teamfighting, vision control or some other aspect of the game. Not everyone excels at everything, but you at least need an understanding of all of these aspects to excel.\n\nTry to focus on what you could have done every game as opposed to what your team could have done. Looking specifically at your win conditions. These change every game based on your teams composition, so you'll need to learn generally about the types of champions and roles you should be looking for.\n\nThis is a video I made on shotcalling a couple of years ago which focuses on win-conditions, I highly recommend anyone with the same problem check this out as its an amazing skill to have (and carried a scrub like me to Challenger with the mechanics of a sloth)\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iFmzrR1exHo\n> \n\nJust make sure your communication with your team is done right. Not everyone will listen all the time, but no-one likes someone who talks down on others. I'm not saying you do this at all, but just err to the side of safety and be overly nice. This is the internet remember, people translate text differently from how you mean it!","replies":[]},{"poster":"WE WUZ KINGZ","date":"2016-06-18T05:07:41.235+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Don't use adc to climb out?","replies":[]},{"poster":"LetsTwitch","date":"2016-06-17T12:37:03.968+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Update: Got over my tilt and played another game.
