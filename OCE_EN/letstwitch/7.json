But if he is mucking around with raptors while mid turret is being taken, then Ill start questioning his ability.\n\nI wont be toxic to them of course, but ill give myself a mental note not to assume that they have my back, so I wont take risks I otherwise would take with a team I trust.","replies":[{"poster":"Nightjar","date":"2017-05-30T01:26:17.670+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"it becomes and entirely different manner however if your jungler gets executed more than once by a jungle camp.

And because you are going ham and 8-0, it is now YOUR RESPONSIBILITY to carry the team. If you fail YOU LOST THE GAME, not your teammates. If you now jack around and get all cocky and don't PLAY TO WIN THE GAME, and you throw, it's YOUR FAULT. YOU LOST. YOU. Seen so many Yasuos and Lee Sins do this. Get ahead but have no clue how to win the game. Kinda because their champion needs to understand some assemblance of macro play or else it's useless.\n\n> Nobody is ever willing to admit that someone on the enemy team is just better, it's always \"We could have won but we got the trash bot that fed you.\" \"GG\" or \"You suck dick but our adc just trolled all game so now u win\"\n> \n> It's such a toxic environment and it must ruin the game for so many people.\n\nYeah, it's terrible how people they just don't give praise anymore, or take responsibility enough to admit that they themselves need to improve. It's always a blame game, typical yank culture influences kids via the internet. Imagine Shane Warne bowling a no-ball that hits the stumps and then going off on a massive rage at how bad the upstairs review panel is, and it's all their fault that he didn't get the wicket... LOL.\n\nI was on a smurf playing normals this morning and stole a dragon with a Janna Q and all the enemy adc could do was rage at his team, when supposedly they themselves were platinum and didn't put their efforts into carrying the game, and they spent all of their time flaming in all chat. Going off at bad players does nothing to help them improve at the game. After the game, I gave them some pointers to the ones that listened (most didn't).\n\n\"Kids are bad and they need to know it.\" - Tyler1","replies":[]},{"poster":"PurpIe","date":"2017-05-29T04:38:31.901+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Its even worse when the enemy who is better than you is a higher elo :(","replies":[]},{"poster":"SirGrugglesworth","date":"2017-05-29T01:40:53.571+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It's not necessarily that they are fucking bad it's that they don't/won't and can't adapt to the situation.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Exarch Leona","date":"2017-05-29T01:38:04.803+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Problem is, and I'm assuming you saw this while playing, A LOT of the players will sit there and let the enemies beat them senseless for a free kill. \nMultiple times, a game.\nOver multiple games. \nFor fun.\n\nBecause they gave up 5 minutes in because {{{some made up excuse}}} usually consisting of \"jungler never ganks so screw this team, he and {{{another role}}} doesnt deserve the win\".\n\nI'll be an example. I'll sit safely at top but I'll get dived and a 2-3 top permanantly per game without any assistence and I give up. Can't help but to, it's obvious our jungler and mids AFK. \nAnd when I support, the ADC either refuses to do anything, or is afk, or is just stupid enough to focus the tank while I beatstick the ADC.\n\nSometimes, they are just horrible to the point they should uninstall. \n\n\nExample;\nI had a game the last night where the Cait was refusing to do anything because \"Braum does no damage but takes no damage\". Yes, that was the excuse. I fell behind. We got to grouping and only 2 would follow up and we'd nail it. Get lotsa kills, blow people up, was awesome. Cait still afk because \"BURAMS NUT WIT MEH\".\n\nAgain, sometimes they are just horrible and should uninstall.","replies":[]}]}
