So, for example, **we look at Annie mid differently to Annie support**. We take a series of performance metrics and compare how you do to all other players in your region in your champion / position combination. **It is percentile driven - so earning a high score means you performed in the top x% of players on that champ in that position.** The grade itself governs the point gains.](http://na.leagueoflegends.com/en/page/features/champion-mastery)\n\nIt's graded on a bell curve, with S+ being the top 2%~ of scores on that champ in that position. It also isn't based solely on KDA. Things like ward placements and objective kills/assists will increase your score as well","replies":[{"poster":"YellowBrickRoad","date":"2016-05-16T04:16:37.158+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yeah i highly doubt thats accurate despite what riot says, im in bronze 5 and i get S+'s on most of my mains fairly regularly.\n\nHell ive gotten S+ with ad soraka in the support lane.\n\nWhich by the logic of the thing you posted means i was being compared against other sorakas in support who werent building retardedly.\n\nBasically i highly doubt i am in the top 2% for such a commonly played champ when my ranking is in the bottom 90%\n\nGranted we can flip the coin and say.\n\nWow im top 2% this just proves that matchmaking is trash tier and i shouldn't be bronze 5 (or bronze 4 whatever i am now, cant remember)","replies":[{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2016-05-16T07:52:26.569+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Scores are relative to skill level.
