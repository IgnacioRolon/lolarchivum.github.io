I&#039;m fine with it normally but being on 0LP and needing to win a game but having an afk ruin that is kind of brutal.\r\n\r\nThat 0LP becomes 75LP on the rank below, effectively putting you back 2 games and then another game to win promos.\r\n\r\nA single AFK person in a single game can equal 3 games of effort which is kind of stupid if you ask me.\r\n\r\nThis feature can be seen in your promos aswell, if you get a troll atleast you have another game to still win.\r\n\r\nNot saying make it infinite chances, just delay it one game so that unfair matches like this cant add another ~2-3 hours of effort on top of the frustration of playing with trolls\r\n\r\nUnless of course you are the troll, in which case get the hell out of my solo queue","replies":[{"poster":"Lewkas","date":"2016-10-04T00:02:47.365+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Unfortunately when considering things like this riot have to look at how easily it can be abused, a system like this could be taken advantage of quite easily. I just had a jungler go afk half way through my last ranked game which put me on 0LP so I know how frustrating it can be. \n\nRiot can't control these people, or possibly these people can't control their internet :S\n\nThe remake system was a good step forward in this direction though.","replies":[{"poster":"The Wanak King","date":"2016-10-04T00:22:37.853+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Still.. There should be something in place.. flike a KDR Counter like for example if you're doing 12-2 as ADC and your jungler is feeding 2-14 or something you seriously shouldn't be de-ranked for something you cant exactly control if you get me..\n\nI guess thats what just happens in Ranked and theres not much you can do.. but that just shows that the good players are stuck in Elo because people just are bad in general and drag you down .. pretty aids if you ask me like as a silver i got outta bronze V last year playing ADC Vayne.. even tho i didnt like it i did it because she was the only champ i used to get out \n\nMost games i could solo carry but some were ceebs no one helped and i was being dragged down some games.... it was horrible you shouldn't be punished for doing well when the other players on your team are doing crap.. thats all im saying","replies":[]},{"poster":"LetsTwitch","date":"2016-10-04T05:11:44.672+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I can deal with it when I'm above 0LP but one troll game shouldnt make 3 games of effort just to equalise it.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"fattyhotdogs","date":"2016-10-04T01:15:11.134+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Would you want to gain LP for a win if there was an afk on the enemy team?","replies":[]}]}
