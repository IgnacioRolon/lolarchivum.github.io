Rarely dodge queues (1-2 times maximum)\r\n2. Never AFK\r\n3. Never noticed by the system for negative behaviour (trolling, flaming, etc.)\r\n\r\nOr, alternatively, give it to players who:\r\n1. Amass a total of 40-50 ribbons (the honorable opponent stuff)\r\n2. Maintain a ribbon in one field for the whole month.\r\n\r\nI think this would be a great way for Riot to give out a small reward to players who stand by the Summoners Code, rather than punishing the bad. Reward the good and it will give incentive to do good things.\r\n\r\nEspecially with this kind of reward, the hextech chest is already giving away skins for free so Riot aren&#039;t totally against this method of rewarding. My idea merely gives a new way to get it for reasons outside playing well. Focusing on the other aspects of the game such as teamwork, friendship and helping over pure skill.","replies":[{"poster":"DipperOCE","date":"2016-08-29T12:57:05.884+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"\"Riot, I didn't do anything wrong for a whole year!
