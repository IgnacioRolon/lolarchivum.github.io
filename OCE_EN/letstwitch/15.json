Most games have trolls","subforum":"Player Behaviour","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"So I am going to go through my match history for the past 20 games and, (discluding premade ones) tally the amount of trolls in the game.\n\nWhat counts as a troll?\nAnyone who intentionally feeds or negatively impacts on the game.\nAnyone with such an outrageously bad score, they cannot be playing properly.\n\nGame 1 - 1 (flaming) Intentional Feeder, 1 AFK, 2 players with 0/4 and 0/8\nGame 2 - Support 0/8/4\nGame 3 - Remake\nGame 4 -\nGame 5 - Support Followed me around all game to take my cs and annoy me. Then afk&#039;ed after 50 minutes. Top laner went 4/17.\nGame 6 - Remake\nGame 7 - Premade. Doesn&#039;t count\nGame 8 - Premade. Doesn&#039;t count\nGame 9 - \nGame 10 - 1/13 Jungle and (flaming) 1/8 support\nGame 11 - 0/10 Support + AFK\nGame 12 - Remake\nGame 13 -\nGame 14 - Premade. Doesn&#039;t count\nGame 15 - Premade. Doesn&#039;t count\nGame 16 - \nGame 17 - 4/14 top and 3/10 jungle\nGame 18 - 3/10 jungle\nGame 19 - Premade. Doesn&#039;t count\nGame 20 - \n\nSo minusing the ones I deemed as not counting.\n\n5 Games were free of trolls/feeders\n5 Had Intentional Trolls\n7 Had Feeders to some degree. Intentional or Unintentional (Most overlap with intentional trolls)\n3 Were Remakes\n5 Were Premades\n\nSo playing on my own, and not counting remakes. I played 12 games.\n5 of those were troll-free with 7 being not.\n\nMeaning 41% of the games were troll free and 59% were not.\n\nWoo Bronze V\n\nNote: Most of my scores were roughly even. Better without trolls but still not feeding when they were there.","replies":[{"poster":"Tele","date":"2016-08-12T23:51:25.997+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":1,"body":"Why are you trying to hide information? I looked up these games myself and you've changed information making it look worse.\n\n+ [**Game 1**](http://matchhistory.oce.leagueoflegends.com/en/#match-details/OC1/143098360/201260463) - Malzahar went 0/7 not 0/8.\n [**Game 2**](http://matchhistory.oce.leagueoflegends.com/en/#match-details/OC1/143098093/201260463?tab=overview) - Lux was 0/8/6 not 0/8/4\n[**Game 5**](http://matchhistory.oce.leagueoflegends.com/en/#match-details/OC1/143096856/201260463?tab=overview) - No one AFKed at 50 minutes, that game only lasted 47:18\n**Game 6, 7, 14, 15 & 19** - Hardly a premade. All of these games were duo.\n\n*\n*\n I also noticed you're very quick to label others as \"trolls\", but never apply the same standard to yourself. Why didn't your 4/15 Jinx game classify as a \"troll\"? You called someone else out for going 4/14 if I remember correctly.\n \n It's clear the problem here is your definition of a \"troll\". _**Loosing lane and having a bad game is not a troll.**_  \n\nI'm sure there are actual trolls in Bronze 5, there's no denying this. But in this case you're over exaggerating, you played with 2 trolls at best.","replies":[{"poster":"Gr1fter","date":"2016-08-16T02:45:03.306+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Rekt...","replies":[]},{"poster":"veo","date":"2016-08-14T12:22:41.098+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"roasted...","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Roguestoney","date":"2016-08-12T21:39:34.830+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You amaze me...","replies":[]}]}
