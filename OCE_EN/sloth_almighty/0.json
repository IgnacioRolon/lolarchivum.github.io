Didnt die once, took a baron and 3 dragons. Helped with a couple towers and inhibs, second highest CS in the game... and only an S. What more can i do?\n(besides winning more, ignore that poor ratio lol)\n\nAlso side note, out Jinx only got an A.

While yes your gameplay of amumu was exemplary, there was probably some other guy out there who got that extra kill early, or cleared his camps a bit quicker, or placed a bunch more wards, or didnt buy two of the same item and was able to power spike quicker and do better etc. Therefore you got the S, still doing very well, but not well enough to be the best of the best.\n\nThis is also why its SUUUUPER easy to get high S rankings on champions in off roles. play Kindred support and just dont feed, bang easy S rank (at least from what ive found) There are so little games to compare to that chances are your average off meta game was probably one of the highest played yadda yadda.\n\nanyways tldr, there was probably some other games in whence players did just a teency wheency bit better than you did, and made smarter item choices haha.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Lord Sesshomaru","date":"2016-09-30T22:27:03.635+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Some champions are much harder to get S with than other, and Amumu is one of them _(due to the amount of people who do well with him)_\n\nI can tell you that Deaths and CS have the most to do with getting an S, CS especially. \n\nthis is a Yorick game of mine:\n\nhttp://imgur.com/a/1nfUy\n\nAs you can see, you don't need a positive KDA to get an S... But look at the CS...\n\nIt really helps if you have friends, I have a good friend who is very good with Amumu, he very rarely ends a game without a perfect score, and he just couldn't get an S. So I picked Shen, and another good friend picked Zilean, and every time Amumu got into trouble, i would just ult him, and Zilean would try to be near as well with his ult. So he was near impossible to kill him, and once he got a few kills ahead, he would just farm up. And he got his lvl 6.\n\nWe did the same with Evelynn for another friend, he gets games like 15/3 often, and gets A. So i played Azir _(who has enough Peel to get anyone low enough for eve to jump in and take the kill)_ and my other friend played Ashe, _(because theres nothing eve can't do against an enemy thats stunned for 3.5 seconds... and that friend is a god at landing cross-map arrows.)_ And he got his lvl 6 too. \n\nAlso the longer the game goes, the easier it is to get an S. Any time under 25 mins is near impossible, 30/40 mins is more possible, and once you are 50/60 mins, you should have enough farm _(if you are focusing on that)_ to get S without problem.\n\nSo my advice would be gank less, play selfishly, farm up like mad _(i got my final lvl 7 S on Taliyah by getting 698 farm. It was an hour long game and I participated in 0 team fights)_ and get friends to be your bodyguards. \n\nGood luck! :)","replies":[{"poster":"Sloth Almighty","date":"2016-10-01T01:25:15.207+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"This sounds counter productive for winning the game, but given the way the game was going, i could have quit helping at the 15min mark and just farmed for 10mins.\nSounds like CS is my key though, thanks for the tip","replies":[{"poster":"Lord Sesshomaru","date":"2016-10-01T03:37:32.526+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Winning plays no part in getting an S or not.
