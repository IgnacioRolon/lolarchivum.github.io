After falling in love with Blitz and deciding to main him I finally got my mastery 7 on him. I also somehow found myself in Bronze 3, though I feel I&#039;m batting above my average even there :P\r\n\r\nBut I often hear people say &quot;I was x division back in season x&quot;, or &quot;I had x champ mastered once&quot;... now i&#039;m curious as to what happens with everything when the season does roll in. Does everyone lose their division placings and become Bronze 5 or unranked? And what about champ mysteries, will everyone&#039;s champs be reset back to level 0 as well? What else gets reset??","replies":[{"poster":"Lord Sesshomaru","date":"2016-08-30T09:58:14.914+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":0,"body":"When the new season comes around, everyone loses their rank and becomes unranked again. However, your MMR stays roughly similar (but often gets slightly lower), which means when you do your 10 provisional games again, if you were Bronze 3, even if you win all 10 games, you will still be placed in bronze/silver, instead of maybe being put in gold or platinum. Inversely, if you are a diamond player at the end of the season, and win only 1 of your 10 provisional games in the new season, you will still be placed in diamond/platinum, (this is so bronze players dont end up in platinum after 10 games, by fluke, and so diamond players don't end up in bronze by fluke.)\n\nonce the season ends, you gain a reward depending on your rank, you get:\n\n**Bronze:** A summoner icon.\n\n**Silver:** A summoner icon and a silver border around your champion in the loading screen.\n\n**Gold:** A summoner icon, a gold border in loading screen, and a limited edition skin.\n\n**Platinum:** A summoner icon, a platinum border, and a limited edition skin.\n\n**Diamond:** A summoner icon, a diamond border, and a limited edition skin.\n\n**Master:** A summoner icon, a master-themed border, and a limited edition skin.\n\n**Challenger:** A summoner icon, a challenger-themed border, and a limited edition skin.\n\nChampion mastery points will not be lost, and your champion mastery level should remain the same. \n\nbut in pre-season _(the time after one season has ended but before the next one has started)_ riot will experiment with a lot of new changes, for example, adding/removing items, changing masteries_ (e.g. last year we didn't have thunderlords or other keystone masteries)_ making jungle monsters or turrets weaker/stronger. and sometimes they update batches of champions that are unbalanced, for example last year they changed a lot of the ADC champions _(Graves didn't always have a shotgun basic attack, and Quinn used to turn into Valor and gain new abilities, instead of being carried by him and moving faster.)_\n\nSome changes made in the pre-season will not stay until the next season, but most will. Pre-season is basically riot trying lots of stuff that will purposely change the game. For example, this year tanks and assassins have been very powerful, so riot may implement changes to make mages and ADC's more powerful, to counteract that _(cos everyone is sick of it)_ but often they cant predict exactly what these changes will do, so they make them in a time where ranked games don't count, so that no one gets mad when their ranked games are screwed up by the changes. \n\nThis pre-season assassins will be getting changed, Katarina, Rengar, Talon and Akali, will all be receiving new/changed abilities. \nThis could be what they are referring to when they say \"i used to have that champion mastered\" as they may have used the champion before the update and then not been good at them once the update happened _(even if a champion is updated however, your mastery points will be unchanged)_\n\nRiot has also said they want to try giving us 10 bans instead of 6 in ranked.\n\nYou can still play ranked in the pre-season, but it wont count towards your current rank, or next seasons rank. But it will affect your MMR, so if you win lots in the pre-season, you can be placed in a higher rank in the next season IF you win enough games in your 10 provisionals.\n\nI hope this helps.","replies":[{"poster":"Talon12","date":"2016-08-30T13:40:13.451+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Lord Sesshomaru,realm=OCE,application-id=Ntey9fRZ,discussion-id=MhszRZqI,comment-id=0000,timestamp=2016-08-30T09:58:14.914+0000)\n>\n\n> This pre-season assassins will be getting changed, Katarina, Rengar, Talon and Akali, will all be receiving new/changed abilities. \n> This could be what they are referring to when they say &quot;i used to have that champion mastered&quot; as they may have used the champion before the update and then not been good at them once the update happened _(even if a champion is updated however, your mastery points will be unchanged)_\n\n\nyou forgot ekko\n\nAnd the 10 bans for for draft pick, not dynamic queue","replies":[{"poster":"Roguestoney","date":"2016-08-30T23:22:52.879+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Talon12,realm=OCE,application-id=Ntey9fRZ,discussion-id=MhszRZqI,comment-id=00000000,timestamp=2016-08-30T13:40:13.451+0000)\n>\n> you forgot ekko\n> \n> And the 10 bans for for draft pick, not dynamic queue\n\nWhat's draft pick.","replies":[{"poster":"QAPLA","date":"2016-08-31T00:26:35.538+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=hippy,realm=OCE,application-id=Ntey9fRZ,discussion-id=MhszRZqI,comment-id=000000000000,timestamp=2016-08-30T23:22:52.879+0000)\n>\n> What&#x27;s draft pick.\n\n^ has never played ranked.","replies":[{"poster":"Roguestoney","date":"2016-08-31T00:30:50.304+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=QAPLA,realm=OCE,application-id=Ntey9fRZ,discussion-id=MhszRZqI,comment-id=0000000000000000,timestamp=2016-08-31T00:26:35.538+0000)\n>\n> ^ has never played ranked.\n\n^ guess again.","replies":[{"poster":"QAPLA","date":"2016-08-31T00:46:34.500+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=hippy,realm=OCE,application-id=Ntey9fRZ,discussion-id=MhszRZqI,comment-id=00000000000000000000,timestamp=2016-08-31T00:30:50.304+0000)\n>\n> ^ guess again.\n\nYou've played ranked but don't know what draft pick is?\nDafuq?","replies":[{"poster":"Sneed","date":"2016-08-31T01:18:25.896+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=QAPLA,realm=OCE,application-id=Ntey9fRZ,discussion-id=MhszRZqI,comment-id=000000000000000000000000,timestamp=2016-08-31T00:46:34.500+0000)\n>\n> You&#x27;ve played ranked but don&#x27;t know what draft pick is?\n> Dafuq?\n\nits a reference to the fact that we dont get draft mode normals in oce, only blind pick\n\nedit: holy shit that happened at the same time","replies":[{"poster":"Roguestoney","date":"2016-08-31T01:21:04.040+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Mesprit,realm=OCE,application-id=Ntey9fRZ,discussion-id=MhszRZqI,comment-id=0000000000000000000000000001,timestamp=2016-08-31T01:18:25.896+0000)\n>\n> its a reference to the fact that we dont get draft mode normals in oce, only blind pick\n> \n> edit: holy shit that happened at the same time\n\n;^)","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Roguestoney","date":"2016-08-31T01:18:01.426+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=QAPLA,realm=OCE,application-id=Ntey9fRZ,discussion-id=MhszRZqI,comment-id=000000000000000000000000,timestamp=2016-08-31T00:46:34.500+0000)\n>\n> You&#x27;ve played ranked but don&#x27;t know what draft pick is?\n> Dafuq?\n\nSarcasm mate... \n\nWe dont have draft normals so it just a little joke comment. :^)","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"DannyMac","date":"2016-08-30T09:59:51.264+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Every season.
