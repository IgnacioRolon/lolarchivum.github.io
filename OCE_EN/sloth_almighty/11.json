Death timers contains several different factors (level, specific game time etc).\n\nI'll post a link at the bottom of this post that specifically gives you the formula, but basically your death timer is:\n\nLevel x 2.5 + 7.5 = Base Respawn Timer (BRT)\n\nThe reason it's a 'base' timer, is because the timer is modified based on the game time. This starts at 15 minutes and increases incrementally every 30 seconds thereafter. \n\nSo say you die 3 times at level 1, that would only be 30 seconds 3x[level 1 x 2.5 + 7.5].\n\nHowever someone dying at minute 53.5 (the cap for incremental Respawn timers) would have a Respawn timer of:\n\n(Level 18 x 2.5 + 7.5) x 1.5 = just over 78 seconds. \n\nNow don't go quoting me on this math, but I hope this gave you a general idea of death timers! :) \n\nHere's the link I promised: http://leagueoflegends.wikia.com/wiki/Death","replies":[]}]}
