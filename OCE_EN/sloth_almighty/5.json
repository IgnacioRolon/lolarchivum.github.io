To make is easier, you can save your Flay passive for the bonus damage when autoing minions.\nIf you can't get it down, its fine just to start {{item:3301}} instead.\n\nMax Q then W then E.\nDon't level an ability until you are sure the enemy won't invade. An enemy invade can be easily countered if you take a lantern.\nUsually you want to start E (as it increases your auto damage with the passive) then get Q level 2 (W level 3).\n\nYou max Q first for the CD. You max W 2nd for the CD (and collect souls to increase the shield).\nYour E CD doesn't change with level and the mana goes up so leveling it last is fine. The passive E damage also scales with Souls so you don't need to max it to increase it damage, just collect souls.\n\nYou can pump fake your Q's. So walk towards/face one champ and throw your hook at a different champion. Can throw people off.\nIf your enemy laner are standing behind range minions, you can walk up to the wave and flay backwards. This will push the minions behind you and allow a \"free\" hook.\n\nI like to run AD Marks, HP Seals, MR glyphs and Armour Quints. AD quints are also acceptable if you run Armour Seals. You just want the AD as Thresh is really good at auto harass in lane.\n\nYou can either go Thunderlords or Bond of Stone.\n\nAs the for the build. Just supporty/tank items depending on the game. He's a good roaming supp so tier 2 boots and Sightstone should be your first 2 items.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Knuuckles","date":"2016-10-06T03:33:58.455+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"His play style is pretty versatile and also dependant on which adc and jungler you have, works really well with laners like Caitlyn and jinx who like to overextend for poke also works great for zoning any melee supports like Leo Ali and braum, but as soon as you miss a hook you lose a lot of pressure in the lane for the next 13 seconds or so, so you're better off using your hook reactively rather than as an engaging tool as is it quite a slow skill shot and pretty predictable","replies":[]},{"poster":"CHEESYLEEKS","date":"2016-10-06T01:34:24.856+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Abcs\n\nAlwas be collecting souls","replies":[{"poster":"The Wanak King","date":"2016-10-06T02:32:43.269+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=CHEESYLEEKS,realm=OCE,application-id=FjGAIbRv,discussion-id=R5vlR1v1,comment-id=0001,timestamp=2016-10-06T01:34:24.856+0000)\n>\n> Abcs\n> \n> Alwas be collecting souls\n\nYes^ Gain Armor and AP","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"The Wanak King","date":"2016-10-06T00:41:26.855+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Rush {{item:2049}} , {{item:3401}}  (imo is better than ascension) Try get {{item:3190}}  before 20 because twill provide more shield plus your Mountain and W, Boots recommend {{item:3117}} After that depending on opposition might want to get {{item:3110}}  {{item:3083}} {{item:3075}} {{item:3102}} \n\nI build full tank once again (in my opinion) it works better in fights\n\nMax W or E first I tend to do, Q, E, W, E, E, R.. ETC, E just helps with dealing some damage W is probably more important but then again if you have shields such as Mountain and Solari probs best not to rush W.. Again it depends on your strategy if you wanna push lane or play defensive too.\n\n\nhttp://www.mobafire.com/league-of-legends/build/thresh-support-guide-453301 (This Builds solid but disagree starting with E and maxing Q, Q is good if you guys wanna poke and stuff but its really not worth doing)\n\n\nhttp://www.mobafire.com/league-of-legends/build/s6-tank-initiate-full-cdr-swiss-army-knife-thresh-support-455189 (same with this however this is the exact build I usually do but its less practical in team fights just pretty much solid tank) \n\nI play Thresh Differently (hence my build) I prefer playing tank with 3-4K health who soaks and pulls, pros play semi high health but more practical items, As mentioned before depends on your strategy and play style, Try both or make your own build which suits you and see which one you feel comfortable playing  with :)\n\nEdit: also I see a lot of trash thresh/blitz players.. please predict pulls so many people are bad at pulling even the enemy team sometime makes me cringe.","replies":[{"poster":"Sloth Almighty","date":"2016-10-06T10:52:18.279+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> Edit: also I see a lot of trash thresh/blitz players.. please predict pulls so many people are bad at pulling even the enemy team sometime makes me cringe.\n\nI back myself in with blitz for my pulls, i've had a lot of game time with him and like to use it as an intimidation thing more than anything, and pull when they think i wont.
