Whether its multiple runes per x IP or re-roll as suggested. What ever the math, that part was irrelevant to my discussion, the point was to highlight the no longer useful lesser runes","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Talon12","date":"2016-05-24T23:56:31.244+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"good idea, lets get 1/4 ip points\n\nneed t chase in 4 for 1 ip. should just get a 10 into 1 randomise roll","replies":[{"poster":"BlackRanger4","date":"2016-05-25T03:10:37.373+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Talon12,realm=OCE,application-id=Ntey9fRZ,discussion-id=EqAcpBjp,comment-id=0000,timestamp=2016-05-24T23:56:31.244+0000)\n>\n> good idea, lets get 1/4 ip points\n> \n> need t chase in 4 for 1 ip. should just get a 10 into 1 randomise roll\n\nDo you realise you can no longer buy T1 runes, so 1/4 of nothing is nothing.\nDo you realise tier 2 runes are only 1 IP, so 1/4 of an IP per rune refund...\n\nSo you think rolling 10 T2 runes into a random T3 rune is a good idea? So I could buy 10 T2 runes for 10IP and then randomly get any T3 rune.... \n\nPeople like me exist to abuse the system, which is why plebs like you and your un-thought out pleb ideas will never take and riot wont bother giving you a reply.","replies":[{"poster":"Talon12","date":"2016-05-25T06:38:33.093+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"give the transform a 5/10/15/20/25 min wait per day\n\n+ abussing things is fun","replies":[]}]}]}]}
