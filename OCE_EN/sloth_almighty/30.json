But when I look for the same 3 stats on Armour items, all I can come up with is the Ohmwrecker?\n\nThe zz rot has all 3, but it is the complete package with MR aswell, not **just** Armour.\nWould there be a reason we see more MR+H+HR items over A+H+HR in game, like do mages do more damage then the physical damage champions now so thats why we see more MR with sustain items over Armour with sustain?\nOr is it the case of MR does not scale as hard as Armour so you need more health to go with your MR for it to be effective?\nOr is it maybe just because of the magic burn items available, you need sustain to counter that?\n\n1 or 2 more Armour with Health and Health Regen options would be nice I think, especially with the tank shredding options available atm.\n\nThoughts?","replies":[{"poster":"Damocracy","date":"2016-09-19T23:06:09.191+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Nope, armour is fine the way it is. If you start putting regen on them then {{champion:36}}  will go everywhere he pleases just not giving a fuck.\n\nThere needs to be some sacrifice for stacking armour over health regen other wise adc's/juggs become useless.\n\nImagine as an adc or jg trying to kill {{champion:8}} who stacks armour/health regen items. Might as well quit league, can't kill them.\nNot to mention {{champion:86}} would just 1 v 5 the whole team kill a couple, run away come back kill a couple more.\n\nThere is a reason why people are complaining about this being a tank meta, adding health regen to armour items would just kill the game.","replies":[{"poster":"Sloth Almighty","date":"2016-09-20T15:07:40.317+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"So why do they have so many mr/health items with regen though? Is magic damage not as painful as physical?\nIm more curious as to why there are more of 1 than the other","replies":[]}]}]}
