While he does not have a typical &#039;powerful ult&#039; as such, his ult grants him the ability to mimic any learnt enemy ability, storing only 3 at a time in his Q, W and E. He would be great for support roles where adaptive play is necessary around laning phase or team fights.\r\n\r\nLore: I&#039;m not a good story teller, but i&#039;m sure someone creative could come up with a good one.\r\n\r\n\r\nAbilities;\r\n\r\n**Passive** _Hardened Intellect_\r\nFor every 3rd damaging hit on Anon, he receives 10% of the damage taken over those 3 hits, as mana. If Anons mana is full, the 10% is gained as a shield, up to a maximum level (%?)\r\n\r\n**Q** _Mimicry 1_ (Cool down subjective to learnt ability, at the base CD rate for the level gained in this ability)\r\nAnon will store any ability here learnt through his ultimate (R).\r\n\r\n**W** _Mimicry 2_ (Cool down subjective to learnt ability, at the base CD rate for the level gained in this ability)\r\nAnon will store any ability here learnt through his ultimate (R).\r\n\r\n**E** _Mimicry 3_ (Cool down subjective to learnt ability, at the base CD rate for the level gained in this ability)\r\nAnon will store any ability here learnt through his ultimate (R).\r\n\r\n**R** _Muscle memory_ (Cool down 180? seconds @ level 1)\r\nAnons ultimate is Muscle memory. Unlike other champions, Anon will start with his ultimate at level 1, with only his ultimate being selectable when the game starts.\r\nOnce Anon has sight of an enemy, he can cast from (x range) his ability to mimic that selected champions ability. Upon casting his ultimate on an enemy champion, you can then press your Q, W or E and learn that champions specific Q, W or E to store in your own. This would be a channeled process (taking x.x seconds, taking damage will interrupt this process and reset the CD). The channel time would be reduced per each level of his R (1, 2 and 3)\r\nAnon will level up like all other champions, and can even level up an empty slot that has yet to be mimic&#039;d. Once Anon has stored a mimic&#039;d ability in his Q, W or E the level will be consistent throughout the game, in the order he has leveled that specific Q, W or E slot too.\r\nSo long as Anons ultimate is not on cool down, he can continuously mimic a different enemy champions ability depending on what the game requires of him, be it a stun, damage, shield or heal etc.\r\n**Anon can NOT mimic an enemies R. As this would be too OP**\r\n\r\nFor example, Anon is laning against a {{champion:99}} , he can eventually mimic Lux&#039;s Q, W and E kit as a whole (if it were desired), even if Lux was to take Q and E only by level 3, Anon could still mimic and learn her prismatic barrier (W). Then a {{champion:55}} comes into sight/range, wanting an extra burst option he opts to mimic Kats E, meaning he loses the ability for Luxs Lucent Singularity, but gains Shunpo in place.\r\n\r\nThis kit gives Anon a very broad range of diversity in game, and i think would give those with a good mechanical working knowledge of champions abilities (such as Ryze, Zed etc) some edge over not having a &#039;true ultimate&#039; like other champions. A good compromise I think.\r\n\r\nWhile I see Anon as a good support role, if balanced right could maybe fit any role, fighter, assassin, even tank?\r\nThe equalizer could be that Anon starts as a squishy, and is subjective to his item build. But item build will also be subjective to the abilities learnt.\r\nI think Anon could be both beneficial to his team, and difficult to the enemy. But not OP as his entire build for the game really needs to be planned out. Otherwise some learnt abilities could be completely useless/ineffective. And as we all know, gold is a hard earned thing not to be wasted on bad item choices.\r\n\r\nAlso, lets say there is a Blue team Anon and a Red team Anon.\r\nBlue Anon casts his ult on Red Anon, then selects Q, W or E and Red Anon will lose the given ability from his kit, meaning he must get close to that enemy to mimic it again, but also puts Red Anons ultimate on CD. So he can&#039;t just go mimic it straight away. Blue anon will not mimic/learn that ability, rather keep the one he has (or doesn&#039;t have). As gaining an ally champions ability would probably be a little OP (champion depending).\r\nThis adds a challenge to playing Anon against another, but if you see another Anon casting a specific ability and you know what the default key stroke is (Q/W/E) you can target that specific ability to reset it for the duration of his cool down.\r\nSince Red Anon must get close to re-mimic that ability, it adds a certain level of risk for him to do so to get close to that enemy champion again.\r\n\r\nI think this would be a very unique champion, and quite fun to play. But also difficult wrapping your head around what abilities would work well together within his kit.\r\nThis champion would be pretty useless in One For All matches however, if both teams went Anon.","replies":[{"poster":"veo","date":"2016-07-25T04:38:56.393+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You have to think about how mechanically difficult it would be to create this champ like think if you were to take Zeds W that would make the shadow have to mimic another champs ability.
