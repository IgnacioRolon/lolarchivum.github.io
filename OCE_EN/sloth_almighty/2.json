When you stretch 3 barrels out thats a decent area covered in an instant.\n\nNot having played much GP, i&#039;m wondering is this even possible? To place barrels 2 and 3, and shoot the first what seems like at EXACTLY the same time?\nIs this some sort of easy thing to do, or is someone actually running a GP script of some kind?\n\nI have the replay saved, just trying to figure out how to get it here to post etc","replies":[{"poster":"idc","date":"2016-09-05T02:50:55.922+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"LOL.\n\nIt's a pretty normal Gangplank mechanic dude. It's called the triple barrel and it's all about timing your barrels correctly. There's no scripting or botting going on here.","replies":[{"poster":"Sloth Almighty","date":"2016-09-05T02:59:51.487+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Ok, thanks for the info. Even on the .25 slow mo replay it looks insanely difficult to press spell button, click where you want it, press spell button and click first barrel to shoot it, press spell button for third barrel and click where you want it... All in less than half a second.\nBut I guess if this is normal for a good GP then I take my hat off to those that can do it. Because that is just insane hand-eye coordination in my books\n\nI might head to a private game soon and try it out myself... End up looking like shooter mcgavin practising happy gilmores run and swing technique in private and looking like a complete wanker in the process lol","replies":[{"poster":"idc","date":"2016-09-05T05:45:48.105+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yeah you pretty much have to place the third barrel as you're detonating the first. Completely catches most off guard if they're not careful.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"QAPLA","date":"2016-09-05T03:16:25.037+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Smartcasting?","replies":[]},{"poster":"CHEESYLEEKS","date":"2016-09-04T19:28:15.405+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"any good {{champion:41}}  does this. pretty common","replies":[]}]}
