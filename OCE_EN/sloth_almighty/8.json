And it&#039;s not addressed why. Which is the selective process of the &quot;Rotating Game Modes&quot;...\nI would like to formally showcase a few collective facts from community views, that I spent a small portion of this morning gathering. **_subject to human error, this was manual collection not automated_\n\nFrom what I can gather, there are **potentially** 13 different game mode variants all available to the RGM.\n(Ascension, Black Market Brawlers, Dominion, Doom Bots, Hexakill, Nemesis Draft, Nexus Siege, One for All, Snowdown Showdown, URF, Legend of the Poro King, Mirror mode, Definitely not Dominion). Which as far as I can tell, DND was a direct replacement for Dominion, but I could be wrong there.\n\n4 months ago RGM was announced, and implemented on 08/04, kicking off with Ascension.\nSince it&#039;s inception (including upcoming at time of this post), we have/will have seen the repetition of the following game modes;\nAscension: 4\nNexus Siege: 3\nHexakill: 4\nLegend of the Poro King: 3\nOne For All: 3\nUltra Rapid Fire: 2\nDefinitely Not Dominion: 2\nNemesis Draft: 1\n\n22 game modes will have been completed up to the current schedule, with only 8 of the potential 13 modes making the cut.\n\nOf the 16 RGM schedule posts made since, there have been an overall total of 829 posts made from the community voicing their thoughts, after L4T3NCY suggests the community do just that. Give feedback.\n\nOf the potential 829 community members who took the time to voice their thoughts, here is a quick graph of what everyone is talking about in the RGM schedules and the game modes they would like to see (your feedback).\nThe below image depicts ONLY people that specifically suggested a specific mode they want to play. It does not count those simply talking about a game mode in general (just to clear that up first).\n[](http://puu.sh/qBCTj/bc1ac1b97f.png)\nhttp://puu.sh/qBCTj/bc1ac1b97f.png\n\nAs you can see, 19% of people are wanting Ultra Rapid Fire which has only happened twice (the bare minimum Riot announced would appear this year, so potentially no more) and 11% of people wanting Doom Bots, which from what I can tell has been boxed away for the last 2 years yet to see the light of day again.\n\nThis is feedback only from people actively taking time to voice their feedback on the forums, a hugely small portion of the Oceanic player base as a whole.\nSince we all know the meaning of the word Rotate is defined as &quot;pass to each member of a group in a regularly recurring order&quot;, it pains me (and many others) to see more game modes come up more frequently than others, and others not even come up at all.\nSurely, amongst all this feedback, and numerous posts about it, someone can and will eventually answer why this Rotating Game mode is not true to its name, and actually rotating them all (or atleast the ones that are not being re-worked).\n\nNo game mode needs to be permanent, nor does it need to be overplayed more than others. Play them all equal amount of times, in a regular rotating fashion. The current system is making certain game modes stale already (not my own opinion, the communities). If they are all played once through the queue of available game modes, without being repeated until each has been played, the community will get more game modes of the ones they enjoy, and less of the ones they don&#039;t enjoy. Again, community feedback.\n\nWill this issue be addressed, or continually hushed under the table to appear its not even an issue at all?","replies":[{"poster":"Tele","date":"2016-08-15T04:44:50.810+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Seriously this research is fucking awesome.

These people obviously don't voice their opinion because they're content with the current rotation.\n\n **This data does not show that 19% of the whole community want URF mode.**\n\nThat said...

That's the sad part, i know almost 2 dozen people in RL that play league and not 1 of them bother coming onto the forums or sharing their thoughts with the Riot community. But they sure as hell have a lot to say about the game they love and how it could be better or change.\nBut as a working example of the few people in the community we can draw results from, who's to say that this is not a small scale representation of the community as a whole? I certainly don't represent a majority of the communities views, but nor do you. But I also have seen nothing from Riot suggesting poor results to particular game modes and how often they are or are not played.\nWhile you may feel doom bots is an \"oppressive troll mode\", how can we be sure this is how the rest of the community feels without Riot coming through with any form of documentation, suggesting for or otherwise?\n\nIf there is a good reason why a certain game mode cant or wont be played, ok, well lets hear it. But from a Riot representative not a community member who has just a different view as the next guy. Otherwise, why leave them out?","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Sloth Almighty","date":"2016-08-15T08:01:46.828+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Third Reich,realm=OCE,application-id=Ntey9fRZ,discussion-id=WVVmbs2n,comment-id=0001,timestamp=2016-08-15T07:11:36.209+0000)\n>\n> To be honest, I want Doom Bots and not URF as URF gets infested by tryhards within 3 hours.\n\nWhilst I agree with the URF infestation of 'try hards' if you will, this is completely beside the point. Being a business owner myself, I respect Riots position in its entirety, you simply can't please everyone (especially on the scale of their customer base). However you can please the majority, by simply finding a middle ground and making the system fair. Thus getting back to my OP, implement all game modes evenly. So you can go on to enjoy your doom bots, i can enjoy more URF, and my friend can have Black Market Brawlers back.\n\n> [{quoted}](name=Tele,realm=OCE,application-id=Ntey9fRZ,discussion-id=WVVmbs2n,comment-id=0000,timestamp=2016-08-15T04:44:50.810+0000)\n>\n> Seriously this research is fucking awesome.

The aim of this post was not to promote a specific game mode, rather highlight the community demand for more of the game modes that are missing from the queue.\nWhilst I personally would love more URF, I don't think any 1 mode should be more prevalent than the next.","replies":[]},{"poster":"4fy9bEOt7y","date":"2016-08-15T07:11:36.209+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"To be honest, I want Doom Bots and not URF as URF gets infested by tryhards within 3 hours.","replies":[]}]}
