Get a troll/feeder/toxic player or deliberate afk&#039;er, look at the report option in the end game lobby and decide this won&#039;t do anything why bother. Or come to the forums to complain about it expecting more results here.\r\n\r\nBut for the last few months now, instead of ignoring those who choose to snuff at the summoners code, I&#039;ve started reporting them and providing as much information as I can for the case in the comment section. On quite a few occasions now, I have received this such notification:\r\n\r\nhttp://puu.sh/rgfhC/aeb4b28c39.png\r\n\r\nThe point is, there are hundreds of thousands(?) of players on the Oceanic server alone, who knows how many active sessions at any given time.\r\nLet&#039;s be real about this, even if 1 out of every 5 games played, there was a report put through... how many people would it take to be employed to purely sit down and review every single report case against an individual. Even if it was a full time job? 5 days a week. There would be many man hours required for this task alone, surely.\r\nYes, there are programs probably written to help speed this process up. Sort out reports in an orderly fashion, only flag repeat offenders etc etc. It still requires human intervention at some point, which in turn requires real time for validation of said report.\r\nSo the fact that I have had quite a few of these already in the few months I&#039;ve been reporting through the correct channels alone, is enough for me to say that reporting people does work. And repeat offenders will be dealt with accordingly.","replies":[{"poster":"trolledallmylife","date":"2016-09-19T10:21:41.949+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"NEWS FLASH DUMBASS!\n\nTAKES 10 SEC TO CREATE A NEW ACCOUNT AND TROLL AGAIN!!!\n\nTAKES 1-2 DAYS TO GET LEVEL 30 AND TROLL IN RANKED AGAIN!!!\n\nUltimately does NOTHING!\n\n{{sticker:zombie-brand-facepalm}}","replies":[{"poster":"Sloth Almighty","date":"2016-09-19T21:51:36.162+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=trolledallmylife,realm=OCE,application-id=T8eq2lFQ,discussion-id=Nucdzq0E,comment-id=0003,timestamp=2016-09-19T10:21:41.949+0000)\n>\n> NEWS FLASH DUMBASS!\n> \n> TAKES 10 SEC TO CREATE A NEW ACCOUNT AND TROLL AGAIN!!!\n> \n> TAKES 1-2 DAYS TO GET LEVEL 30 AND TROLL IN RANKED AGAIN!!!\n> \n> Ultimately does NOTHING!\n> \n> {{sticker:zombie-brand-facepalm}}\n\nI can tell you have been trolled all your life, you seem angry.

Apart from that it does NOTHING.\n\nEg, last game we had an Ekko top, Reksai jungle. Ekko gets ganked 2 times and dies because he's sitting on the enemy tower without warding. So he badmouths Reksai and takes his red buff. In retaliation Reksai then sits top lane all game taking farm away from Ekko. Meanwhile the enemy is pushing down towers and goon squadding all over the map. In the end to troll one another the enemy team was inside our base destroying our nexus towers whilst Reksai farmed the enemy jungle and Ekko ran down bot lane. Both trolled one another so the other would lose and the rest of us were just along for the ride.\n\nNow how does an automated system differentiate between 2 people being toxic as fk and trolling one another to people just playing shit? It can't! So the real trolls and asswipes who continually ruin the game for others go on there merry way to continue their BS ways. But hey, don't you dare say anything to them in all chat because you'll either cop a chat restriction from the duds reporting you or you'll cop and insta ban.\n\nI started a thread about this a few months ago and in all honesty nothing will change. Riot just don't care as long as people keep buying skins etc.\n\nI really don't understand why they don't implement something along the lines of the CS:GO report reviews. People get to actually watch the in game footage to see if people really are trolling and griefing or just playing bad. If majority of people who watch the replay vote in favor then that person receives a ban. Ban lengths or severity could be altered accordingly based on the players report history. Riot could also introduce a reward incentive for those who continually review and give accurate feedback regarding toxic players. If you don't want to do the dirty work let others do it for you and clean up the community. Or at least give SOME sort of deterrent.\n\nIt's just ridiculous the way things are and Riot seem to be set in their ways on really not giving a shit about it's player base and in return others don't give a shit about the game. It's just one big toxic trashy circle that's part and parcel with f2p games and a lack of player support.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Erøse","date":"2016-09-20T02:50:41.991+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Been reporting toxic players for quiet a while now and I never get feedback lol","replies":[]},{"poster":"QAPLA","date":"2016-09-19T22:28:29.139+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It's just one big Salt Lake City bro, it's called the internet.","replies":[]},{"poster":"QAPLA","date":"2016-09-19T21:51:22.252+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Omg all the man hours involved, you couldn't like, have a system where the players do it, for free even.\nYou could even give it some \"justicey\" name like 'the tribunal'.
