If the champion completes the channel, a homing tether is shot out attaching to the first enemy champion it hits (Other enemy champions can intercept the tether).\n\nOnce this tether attaches to the hit enemy champion, you are pulled in towards the tethered target. Your basic movement is disabled and you go where the tethered target goes during the duration of the ultimate.\n\nWhile tethered, you can continue to AA or cast your other 3 abilities to either the tethered target or any enemy around you as normal. The tethered target can continue to AA or cast their abilities as normal also.\n40% of any damage you receive while tethered, will be transferred from you to the tethered target.\n\nOnce the duration of the ultimate is complete, 30% of all damage taken by the tethered target will be gained as health to you (damage taken during the duration of the tether), however if the tethered target dies during the tether, 60% of all damage taken by the tethered target will be gained as health to you (damage taken during the duration of the tether).\nIf you die during the duration of the tether, 20% of all damage taken by the tethered target will be refunded as health to them (damage taken during the duration of the tether).\n\n**--- Strategic Uses ---**\n\n- If your ally is being targeted by the tether, due to the channel duration your team has enough time to quickly decide if they should intercept (IE, the Tank).\nIf the Tank can absorb more damage than the tethering champion, the tank can continue to help out fighting other enemy champions along with the rest of the team, while ignoring the tethering champion.\n\n- Target priority, Allies of the tethering champion will need to decide if they will 'all in' on the tethered target, to not only put them out of the fight, but heal their tethering champion in the process. But doing so also leaves the other 4 enemy champions free to target who they like uncontested while this happens.\n\n- Turret diving, this would be a great strategic maneuver. Would force the tethered target to leave the safety of their own turret, unless they wish to take 40% of their own turrets damage. Exposing them to the enemy waiting outside of the turrets range. \n\n- You go where I go, since the tethered target is free to move around during the ultimate, they can decide the fate of the ultimate. If the Tank is tethered, they can drag the tethering champion to the back-line and wait for the tether to finish, then destroy the tethering champion. However the tethering champion is free to wail on the tethered target during the ultimate, and could just kill them in the mean time.\n\n- Since this ultimate applies no damage on hit, it would not interrupt things like Recall. So if a champion is tethered during a Recall, they would need to decide if continuing with the recall is worth taking 40% of deadly Spawn pad fire when they get home. If they die on their own spawn pad, the tethering champion might heal just enough in time to {{summoner:4}} off the enemy spawn pad and survive.\n\n- Hooks, Grabs and Knock backs would be a great strategic use for both sides. The turrets could be a big advantage or disadvantage for either the tethered target or the tethering champion.\n\n- Would also be interesting with things like Tahms Devour and Abyssal Voyage, Bards Magical Journey and even Kalistas Fate&#039;s Call?","replies":[{"poster":"Nightjar","date":"2016-07-28T08:07:06.688+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"sounds a little too complicated. Complicated ults don't really work in teamfights and take alot of effort to code. I doubt we'll see anything more mechanically complicated than fiora, jihn or illoi ults for quite some time. Riot generally doesn't like such complicated ults too because of the fact that it needs to be somewhat understandable at a glance so that it doesn't confuse players and can be levered with full effectiveness during a teamfight.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Sloth Almighty","date":"2016-07-26T11:47:38.853+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Also would give more use to Zhonyas for both sides of the tether, aswell as heals and other invulnerable abilities etc","replies":[]}]}
