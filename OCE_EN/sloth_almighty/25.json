Missed out by several seconds, between the third kill and the fourth.\nBut then I&#039;ve just seen a friend get a penta-kill, where the 4th was killed, then exactly 29 seconds later got the 5th and the penta.\n\nSo are useless players such as myself not allowed to get multi-kill combos because it will make someone want to kill themselves, or is this a glitch or something?

Especially because if you've killed 4 players already, the last guy is probably legging it outta there so you have to chase a bit :P","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"ShiishKabob","date":"2016-09-02T00:42:12.515+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Glow,realm=OCE,application-id=FjGAIbRv,discussion-id=R1gBJQE7,comment-id=0000,timestamp=2016-09-01T22:54:55.932+0000)\n>\n> It&#x27;s ten seconds between 1/2/3/4 kills, then from a quadra to a penta you have 30 seconds, however if an enemy respawns the time ends and you can no longer get a penta.\n\nIt's so funny when you spot people that work for Riot it makes you GLOW!!!","replies":[{"poster":"QAPLA","date":"2016-09-02T03:16:52.415+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=ShiishKabob,realm=NA,application-id=FjGAIbRv,discussion-id=R1gBJQE7,comment-id=00000000,timestamp=2016-09-02T00:42:12.515+0000)\n>\n> It&#x27;s so funny when you spot people that work for Riot it makes you GLOW!!!\n\nIt's so funny when you spot people that have obviously been driven away from their own servers boards, so come troll these ones.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"CHEESYLEEKS","date":"2016-09-01T23:04:37.927+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I had the same thing happen to me on karthus\n\nFeelsbadman","replies":[]}]}
