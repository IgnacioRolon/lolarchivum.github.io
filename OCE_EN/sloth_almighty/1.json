Surely.","subforum":"Miscellaneous","up_votes":2,"down_votes":3,"body":"After playing blitzy support to my adc corki, we faced off with a cait and soraka.\nAll the damage we could put on cait, was negated even faster by soraka heals.\nSo you switch focus to soraka but she plays so super safe you have to stick your neck out to get a touch in, and get punished for it by cait.\n\nNow I&#039;m not saying THIS is the reason raka needs nerfing, even though our jg never once visited bot lane, I&#039;m sure there where other tactics that could have been employed as a counter.\n\nBut because the heals where so broken, I decided I&#039;ll get raka and do the same. Which I did, and it proved the same that my adc had 100% sustain because of her heals. Now I want to play her all the time because I know how broken she is. Even sona can&#039;t out heal soraka not even close.\n\nSurely I&#039;m not the only who thinks her heals, from the get go, are too powerful?\nI really don&#039;t wanna play soraka all the time but if she is this broken why wouldn&#039;t you lol\n\nPlease discuss.","replies":[{"poster":"Roguestoney","date":"2016-09-05T03:23:04.760+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"You gotta focus the soraka first my dude.

Most Soraka's start Q instead of the heal, and she can spam that every 2-3 seconds whilst barely losing any of her mana. I think her abilities need to cost more mana to prevent Soraka from spamming heals and Q's for days. These abilities should be used in more strategic ways and less as a harass in lane, especially because Soraka shouldn't be allowed to half health your ADC with a couple Q's at level 1, 2 and 3. \n\nI also think the movement speed she gets on her Q needs to be removed. The Q itself already has a ridiculous slow, which makes it hard to chase after her, but giving her that added movement speed makes it almost impossible. She needs a bit more counterplay rather than 'just kill her'.","replies":[{"poster":"Requiemsfire","date":"2016-09-05T06:56:44.549+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Just ask the question how many other supports do I have to specifically focus to make winning a team fight viable?","replies":[{"poster":"idc","date":"2016-09-05T07:51:46.615+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"And the answer is none of them.

Only useless CC bots like Braum, Thresh, Ali, or Leona who are tanks are not worth focusing.

Simply focusing her isn't a strong tactic because if she's good at playing Soraka she won't be so caught out of position to be focused to begin with. She makes smart plays rather useless and trades pointless while being able to bring back almost anyone from near death back to full hp within mere seconds. \n\nBut when talking about whether or not Soraka in particular needs a nerf, I honestly think windspeakers needs a nerf.
