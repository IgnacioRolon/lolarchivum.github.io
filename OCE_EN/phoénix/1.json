I'm not tilted or bitter about it so any concerns over that may be set aside, I don't claim to be Mata but I definitely don't consider myself inexperienced either.\n\nJust looking for someone who is serious about wanting to climb and knows their role (pref ADC), no ragers or tilters please. Also, discord\nwould be helpful but not entirely necessary and I'm 28 so would prefer someone 18+ (for banters sake).\n\nFeel free to reply here or add me in game, I play most nights and more on the weekend.\n\nI look forward to escaping hell together :)","replies":[]}
