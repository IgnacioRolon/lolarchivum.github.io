If the displayed ping is how long it takes a packet to get from point A to point B and back again, then packet loss is the packet not making it at all. It isn't reflected in your ping because the packet isn't there to tell you how long it took. Instead of things being delayed, packet loss will often result in things like jumps or choppy movements as things catch up past the lost packets.\n\nThe tl;dr is, it's probably connection related and not client related, but where specifically the issue is can be difficult to track.\n\nYour best first step is going to be checking the service status of your ISP, they pretty much all have a page that will tell you of any service interruptions or maintenance going on that might be affecting your connection.
