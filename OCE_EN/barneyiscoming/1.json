Your MMR is largely decided by your overall winrate. You need to keep your winrate above 50% (preferably 55%) in order to gain more LP then you lose.\n\nYour current winrate is only 48% (56-61). Get that up and your LP will be more. Has nothing to do with individual performances.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2018-01-28T15:20:49.884+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The idea is you've hit where you belonged, but now you're winning a lot and climbing. To ensure you keep consistent you'll get lower lp gains until your mmr rises to match the mmr you are playing with. Basically if you've actually improved then you'll be winning more than losing, and the lower gains means you won't climb too fast beyond your skill. If you are just getting lucky, or having a really good week, or your main has been overtuned, then you'll still only be winning about 50% of games, so with higher lp losses you will fall back to your appropriate rank.\n\nI hope that makes sense, it's a lot for sure. It's basically to stop winstreaks from catapulting players into mmr ranges too high for them, then having to face the crushing defeats that come with playing against people too much better than you, as well as to preserve the overall quality of matchmaking for other players.","replies":[{"poster":"BarneyIsComing","date":"2018-01-28T16:24:52.406+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Okay thanks man","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Talon12","date":"2018-01-28T15:13:14.211+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"it goes down in value when hidden mmr is way below actual mmr, and up if your hidden mmr is way above actual mmr","replies":[]},{"poster":"DillanTheVillan","date":"2018-01-28T13:51:35.991+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"lp is not about kills lose streak might take it down and win streak will take it up","replies":[{"poster":"BarneyIsComing","date":"2018-01-28T14:16:53.907+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Ive had winstreaks,  i gain less and lose more thats stupid","replies":[{"poster":"DillanTheVillan","date":"2018-01-28T14:50:55.240+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"alg did you believe im silver s6? and got straight to plat, you will be the next me","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Socon","date":"2018-01-28T14:31:11.416+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You're not getting much LP because your mmr is silver 5 but your rank is silver 4. You'll need to have a positive win ratio in order to get more LP from your wins. For example, when i got into gold 5 for the first time i was on a 7 game win streak and my mmr was gold 3, every game in gold 5 i was getting about 28 lp. Basically the LP system tries to adjust your rank to your MMR.\n\nNote: You will also be matched with people around your MMR, not your Rank.\nDouble note: Even if you go on win streaks it means nothing if you've been on a loss streak, you're only cancelling out what you lost.","replies":[]},{"poster":"DillanTheVillan","date":"2018-01-28T13:52:09.439+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"but hey complaining isnt gonna make it better gl :)","replies":[]}]}
