It's stricter than you really have to be, but if you're prone to negativity then it's a good way to keep yourself out of trouble.\n\nIf someone is tilting you, just mute them. No amount of lost communication is going to be worth how much worse tilt makes you play, nevermind if it tempts you into negativity. \n\nIf all else fails, unbind your enter key with something like auto hot key or gaming keyboard software if you have it. That way you can still read what they say but aren't tempted to  type back.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Örnn Bot","date":"2018-01-16T20:04:19.497+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"if you're dishonored or level 1 or any level and locked you will not receive end of season honor rewards. that said your games might not be as clean as you think even calling out peoples kda as a bm can stop you from getting your honor back.","replies":[{"poster":"QAPLA","date":"2018-01-16T23:16:13.435+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Örnn Bot,realm=OCE,application-id=FjGAIbRv,discussion-id=g2nuIGww,comment-id=0001,timestamp=2018-01-16T20:04:19.497+0000)\n>\n>you will not receive end of season honor rewards.\n\nNo such thing.","replies":[{"poster":"Örnn Bot","date":"2018-01-17T08:38:59.162+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"i am correct if your honor is locked or its 0 you wont get end of season rewards, end of season rewards are for level 2+ but that's if you honor is not locked","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Ingénue","date":"2018-01-16T22:07:00.656+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"So unlocking honor and moving back up isn't so much about being honored (yes they do help a lil but aren't the end all be all of moving up), it's about maintaining a positive/neutral attitude throughout your games.
