Also, knowing your enemy is a big part of pro tournaments, which is ultimately the experience that Clash is trying to deliver to the lay-player.\n\nIf you just want to play teams without the tournament element, that's what flex queue is for.","replies":[]},{"poster":"DarkShade918","date":"2019-09-07T23:30:50.589+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"If you've ever watched pro-play, you'll see target banning is a big part of it.\n\nClash plays by similar rules to Pro-Play, Seeing enemy champs means you can understand and adapt to their playstyle, if the enemy mid has 22 games on Zed while the adc only has 6 games on Kai-Sa, who are you more likely to ban\n\nAdaptability is key to league, in low elo not so much, in plat+ yeah, big part of it\n\nThis is why OTPing a champ is bad, and you should know a minimum of 5 champs per role (or ones that you can flex pick between those roles)\n\nIf you OTP a champ, you don't deserve to win lmao, because it means you're only good at one thing","replies":[]}]}
