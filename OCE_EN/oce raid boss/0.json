After so long, most would have fallen to their own, selfish, decisions, or would have forgotten why that waited for so long. But not this one. This one was chosen for her patience. For her diligence, for her self control. But mostly for her willingness to obey. To interpret correctly what was wanted of her. And after all her waiting the time is almost upon us. To finally take this system for ourselves.\nThe ground trembled slightly, a rumble running through the land like a small tremor caused by the shifting of the plates. But it was not the earth beneath that was waking; it was her. A stirring in the mind of a being countless ages old who once roamed the stars, who has been resting while those same stars slowly blinked out from the night sky. Tendrils of thought, having spread from her over time, pulsated gently like corrupted veins. Over time She had increased her sphere of influence through the generations of the mortals that inhabit this world. Observing. Collecting. The old Emperor&#039;s of Shurima had risen and fallen like the sand they so claim as their own. The noble Icathian&#039;s had gone from rulers of the land, to slaves, to finding their &quot;freedom&quot; in the time she took in between what could be described as heartbeats. Time meant nothing to this one, but the knowledge it granted meant that it was worth her being here.\n\nIn the Void, there is nothing but an eternity of darkness and nightmares to travel through, and the dream like monstrosities that called that place home had been making their way to this realm over time. First the one Cho&#039;Gath, a being of endless gluttony. An amalgamation of teeth and claws and hateful glowing eyes. He had been slipped into a portal small enough for a rodent, and had spent centuries absorbing enough energy to become one of the largest and most powerful creatures to walk the planet. Then, Kassadin. A more.. subtle ploy was needed for this one. The erasure of his wife and daughter ensured that his descent into the Void would be all the more powerful if he believed it was of his own accord. Then over time the measure grew bolder. A new prophet was chosen. One whose thirst for knowledge almost matched her own. Malzahar was granted the powers of the Void, in an effort to usher her into awakening. He reveled in his own abilities, and in doing so spread her influence on the surface in ways she was unable to. He brought another devourer to the land, a Kog&#039;Maw, who would give the mighty Cho a challenge in his own right of who could devour the most. But they both knew their place. They all did. She would not permit it otherwise. \n\nThe two hunters Rek&#039;Sai and Kha&#039;zix slipped through the darkness that began to permeate the land. And so the sand was stained with blood, and the jungle ran with rivers of death and destruction. They were needed at their strongest, and so she pushed her urgency into their minds and they relished it. They could not be held back and She had no mind to do so. As the mortal races warred amongst each other her children flourished in the decay that was left behind, becoming legends in their own right. The Voidreaver, the Void Burrower, The Mouth of the Abyss and countless others. The terror they wrought was not intentional but it fueled them more than the flesh they so craved. The screams of children in the night cut off by the crunching of throats and spines, and it was only ever the blood that would be found the next day.\n\nThe mortals even did her work for her, and the Star Dragon himself was brought down by the lowly mountain worshippers. Warriors who claimed they fought for the sun while the darkness flowed underneath them. With one of her greatest obstacles removed from the delicate equation She had been given to solve, her mind moved to other matters. She knew it was soon to be time to rise. To release the darkness the mortals had so foolishly tried to harness ages long past. The ruins that decorated the deserts were testament to that, and gave her a small sense of satisfaction. That, She would allow herself.  \n\nThere was one thing She had not accounted for.. One thing that She could not entirely understand. This Kai&#039;Sa, one who somehow was not taken by the Void but managed to harness its abilities for her own means. It was unforeseen, but not necessarily something to be dealt with immediately. She could perhaps have her own uses. Absolute power corrupts absolutely and if she was driven far enough to use more than she could handle.. An Avatar for her, or for perhaps her master would be useful.. But that was not her decision to make. And if She was processing that They would already have thought about it infinitely more than she had.\n\nAs her thoughts began to take more vivid shape so did her body. One that had become part of the land began to solidify, or at least into a form that would be useful on this world. It was not her first time rising from the mantle of the earth on a star, She had done so many a time in the far past. She so enjoyed this, the way she would rise from the ground and those beneath her would tremble and she would know that their blood was cold, because she knew everything. The Summoner&#039;s who so boldly sought to control the lesser races would fall to insanity as they failed to comprehend her power as had all those before them had. A Void Dragon would be born, as She had time and time again and nothing ever remained behind. \n\nBut even She knew her place.\n\n-\n\n\n\n_In another system countless light-years away, a roiling darkness slowly makes its way through the emptiness of space. It can be seen from further away than one might think, a slow disappearance of a star here and there, one that never comes back but is not noticeable as there are still so many. But there used to be far more, more stars than could ever be counted. This darkness was as old as light itself, but was known by few, and those who did remember chose not to think about it lest they fell into a gibbering madness. This was the end of all things, where the light was taken and replaced by a nothingness that not even time could recall there ever being anything there. An entity that had not met its match and knew nothing of failure, or fear. _\n\nThe hour is almost nigh\n\nYes, the planet will reach high enough levels soon\n\nIt will be a useful staging point\n\nThey should fall like all others\n\nPerhaps they might bring a challenge\n\nWe will devour them either way\n\nThat is good.\n\n_All these thoughts happened instantaneously as it began to make its slow way to the planet the Summoner&#039;s called home. At its head there was one feeling that rose above all others. One that sent a ripple of excitement throughout all the creatures of the Void, even the ones who were not born from it._\n\n**Hunger.**","replies":[{"poster":"ArtichokeMeDaddy","date":"2018-03-22T10:54:01.635+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"YOO THIS IS FUCKING LIT.
