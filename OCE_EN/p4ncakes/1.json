If not, there's always a possibility it could be brought up alongside Black Market Brawlers for a weekend, if they've been planning on it. They could even set up a rotation specifically for map variants (including updated Magma Chamber, Winter SR, Halloween SR) which is unlikely but one can dream ; )","replies":[]},{"poster":"Firebolt","date":"2016-06-17T14:02:36.831+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I just want that Bilgewater music back in game more than anything.
