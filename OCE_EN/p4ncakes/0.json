If Mark hits an enemy, **you gain the ability to cast Dash for the next 3 seconds**.\n\nPoppy&#039;s W does not block Malphites &quot;Unstoppable Force&quot; which clearly defines the ability as a dash BUT with the addition of immune to crowd control in the description.\n\nThis seems like an over sight and should be reworded.\n\nTom","replies":[{"poster":"Tele","date":"2016-02-12T06:51:16.625+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Riot has made the Mark/Dash's immunity reasonably clear visually. It literally makes you a snowball and your health bar and name become transparent.\n\nhttp://imgur.com/NksrS6F\n\nRegardless it's probably a good idea to get some more clarity in. I wouldn't be surprised if a full ability description rework was being planned for the future.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Bambooze","date":"2016-02-12T09:06:19.231+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Your character becomes invulnerable when in snowball form.
