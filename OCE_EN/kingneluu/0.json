You have to play a lot of games without leaving for your leaver status to diminish down back to 5 minute LPQ's. If you have questions about the system, please read the [Leaver Buster FAQ here](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752714-LeaverBuster-FAQ).\n\nIf you have neither left any other games nor received 5-15 minute LPQ's before, then more likely than a bug is that someone else was using your account.
