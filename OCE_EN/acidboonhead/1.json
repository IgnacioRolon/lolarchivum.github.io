I believe this deserves reports.\r\n\r\n**2: The option to honor people after I left the honor screen, and after I left the end-game stats.**\r\nReason: Sometimes people point stuff out that I didn&#039;t think of making me willing to honor that player.\r\nSide note: I also want to be able to honor multiple players. We can already report multiple players, so why not with honor?\r\n\r\nI am no programmer or anything like that, but: we can see the last people we played with when trying to add new friends or start a new game. This makes me believe my wishes are possible to realize.","replies":[]}
