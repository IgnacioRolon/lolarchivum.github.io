As you can see in the Skin Spotlights video, there were two sounds, a primary and an alternate. First blip, then bloop. As of 5.23 (I think), however, there is only one sound.","url":"http://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/bug-report/FvNjdvXB-arcade-miss-fortune-love-tap-sound-bug","image":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/DZ1el_4RwFI/hqdefault.jpg"},"up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Seriously, Riot... Why haven&#039;t you fixed this yet? It&#039;s been about half a year and you still haven&#039;t fixed the missing sound effects on Arcade Miss Fortune&#039;s Love Taps regarding the &quot;blip, bloops&quot; on alternate targets. Call me crazy, but I can&#039;t play her without it; it made her so enjoyable. But now it&#039;s gone.\r\n\r\nHow do you recreate the bug?\r\n1. Play Miss Fortune with Arcade Miss Fortune skin\r\n2. Attack something (hear the blip)\r\n3. Attack something else (hear another blip)\r\n4. Be sad by the lack of bloops\r\n\r\nCome on... I really want to play her again.","replies":[{"poster":"Ingénue","date":"2016-05-18T16:05:15.022+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Oce doesn't really deal with bugs.
