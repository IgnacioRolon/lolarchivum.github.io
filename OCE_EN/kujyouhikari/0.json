They decorated the black canvas of the night sky like musical notes on a page, drawn by a musician with little care for understanding. He listened to their humming, and to the little stories they silently whispered. \n\nThis one spoke of a smiling boy who never failed to care for others until his lack of care for himself proved fatal. This one murmured of a child who never failed to love himself even if he was not anything other than normal. And this one, sang of a cowardly adult who, for her own unrequited love, took up arms to allow her escape.  \n\nHis own star, too, told a story. A story of a girl who was clumsy in kindness and hopelessly honest to herself, who burned strong in her loyalty to those she loved. \n\nPerhaps, Bard thought as he lowered his sight from its brilliance, it was fitting that before her final moments, she admitted to him that she feared death. &quot;You know, I really had fun as a Star Guardian,&quot; her words are clearly etched into his memory even now. &quot;I mean, I have regrets and everything, don&#039;t get me wrong.&quot; She gave a grimace at that. &quot;I wish I was less careless, and stronger, so that I don&#039;t have to die.&quot; Giving a glare at the black patterns twining and rotting away her life, she continued, &quot;I wish I had more time. I want to be with my family, my friends, with you, Bard, my partner. A-And I know it&#039;s going to be gone soon.&quot; Biting her lips in her first expression other than a smile, she whispered helplessly, &quot;It&#039;s not fair.&quot; \n\nBard was much smaller then, in time and in size. So he did the only thing he could. Lifting his tiny arms with slight effort, he hugged her wrist that was still devoid of the markings. He wriggled himself onto her arm, and blew into the pipe, his only means of comfort. It was the first song she heard from him, on a night just as quiet and just as magical. Now the tune carried a certain melancholy to it, and uncharacteristically he faltered on several notes.  \n\nBut she asked for an encore with such a peaceful half-smile that he played and played and spun new songs with a desperation he cannot remember, and it was Bard who played her mourning songs on that dawn in a place far, far away from her family, her friends, with only a single moon in the sky. \n\nIt was Bard who made the final decision to not choose another partner. They argued that he was young, and had the unprecedented talent of reading the stars, of listening to the stars. It was to early to give up, and too childish to not move on. (Ironic of them, who shunned and hated him out of what was jealousy and fear.) In response, he quietly lifted his pipe with its new yellow ribbon and blinked away. \n\nTime passed before he found a way to fight on his own, but he did. Bard grew to understand her grimaces of pain when hurt, and grew increasingly fond in admiration as he learnt the difficulty of battle. She had fought against these monsters alone, never faltering or hesitant in her steps. He was not adult enough to give up, either.  \n\nAnd it was on nights with eager stars like this that he visits the strange planet with a single moon. Taking a heavy seat with his now large body and beard which she had last cut, he chimes new stories and play that tune which never fails to connect the two of them, who are never too far apart.","replies":[]}
