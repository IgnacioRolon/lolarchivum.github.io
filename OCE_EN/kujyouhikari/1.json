One main one is that Voidreaver is not a specific title of Kha&#039;zix, rather, one collective of Void-spawns.\n\nI don&#039;t think it is the best constructed thing I have done, and was hoping for some thoughts on the handling of emotions in the story. Thanks.\n\nYou can skip the text wall at additional settings and info, but it might help with some understanding of the story that I had to fit within 1500 words. This is a pretty massive wall though, warning you.\n \n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n \n**A Name to Remember by**\n \nIts first thoughts were on how cold it was. Rolling down the cliff and stumbling across terrain had torn open parts of Its outer shell, leaving the exposed tissue oozing precious mustard liquid. Ice crystals threatened to keep the gash open as It sputtered out a blood-filled white breath. \n \n_Careless_, Its eyes flared at memory of the last hunt, _too careless._\n \nShock.\n \nIt licked the fresh blood in Its mouth with what could only be described as wonder. Questioningly, It slowly tested the newly-learnt words on tongue. &quot;Karr-sss, Kerr-, Carr-&quot; Rasping prevented coherence. Voidreavers, it seems, were not built for speech._ Voidreavers?_ Images of purple creatures, each increasingly grotesque in muscle mass, flashed briefly.\n \nThere was no time for such pondering, however, as It now recognized the signals from limbs as- \n \n_Pain pain pain pain Mommy it hurts It hurts Are those teeth I can&#039;t breathe-_\n \nClipping off the memory was easy once It found the source. Curiosity was what fueled Its last meal&#039;s memory to burst forth, and deleting it resolved that problem. The priority now shifted to the unbearable cold.\n \nThe devouring cold. It gnawed at Its insides and wounds, craving and raving without end. Testing limbs for function, It stood, noting that It had left a dent in the ice. Straightening out disjointed wings, It turned to face the sound of heels on ice.\n \nA woman _smiling smiling Really heels for my birthday Now isn&#039;t that beautiful-_ approached leisurely, her haughty aura rolling off like a carpet.\n \nCaught. She held the sharp half-tiger half-wolf claws with ease, with an unexpected strength It could not break out of. _Careless!_ Its new instincts echoed in an increasingly nervous mind. _Careless Danger Please please Not yet the cake_\n \nReality slammed in with the impact of body on rock. Looking up while shutting off the signals granted a sight of lips twisted in a mischievous smile. &quot;I&#039;m a witch,&quot; she declared, puffing her chest out. &quot;It&#039;ll take a lot more than that to kill me, midget.&quot;\n \n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n \n&quot;Kha&#039;zix.&quot;\n \nWatching with wary eyes, It tentatively reached out for piece of metal-like object offhandedly thrown in Its front a few minutes prior.\n \nWith increasing frustration at a lack of reaction, she repeated, &quot;Kha&#039;zix. That&#039;s my name.&quot; Staring at the creature taking a hesitant bite at the strange food with exasperation, she added, &quot;That should keep your information loss down for a while. A heart of a named metal dragon is more than enough to process for a few years.&quot; Kneeling down, she checked the creature&#039;s size, little higher than her thigh, &quot;Maybe a few decades if you keep growth to a minimum.&quot;\n \nProceeding to chew. The so-called heart was tougher than expected, and lessened the cold that seeped into Its stomach.\n \n&quot;&hellip;&hellip;.&quot; This material was possibly even better than the first complex being It had consumed earlier in the day. Or was it yesterday?\n \nAn audible sigh was heard. &quot;Well, you could at least reply with your own name. Or something other than midget.&quot;\n \n_Mommy loves you Iris It is a special day tod-_\n \n&quot;No name yet, then?&quot; It nodded, hunger now sated. &quot;&hellip;This midget might be more trouble than it is worth.&quot;\n \n \n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n \nThe cave seemed good enough for cover. Though It had no qualms with water or cold from the outside, Kha&#039;Zix was not the same. Setting down on her good leg, It surveyed her damage. The sight was almost alien, almost as if It was still within a dream.\n \nKha&#039;Zix had set out for a rare creature as food for the umpteenth time that evening. With a simple eye signal, It followed her through the forest of stalagmites as she sought the rock wyvern that had recently carved a trail of destruction. What laid in wake, however, was not the creature, but an ambush of skilled bounty hunters seeking for the rumored material of immortality and a rare neutral Voidreaver. Both would sell extremely well in the Bilgewater market, and this reward attracted a fair few who owned artefacts to counter the stronger of the two.\n \nNo matter how hard she tries to hide it, Kha&#039;Zix has been weakening in power for past decades. Deep wounds It inflicted in assassination attempts had healed within moments, but now a simple torn limb took hours, perhaps even days when she came down with a feverish haze. Its stomach twisted as It swallowed, mouth strangely dry.\n \nA bloodied hand was shoved into the forefront of Its vision. &quot;Here, my mistake, and you haven&#039;t had proper sustenance for a while.&quot; Smiling wryly, she nudged the gleaming white teeth, already salivating as It frowned and turned away. &quot;Look, no matter how delicious you find my cooking, it doesn&#039;t prevent you dissipating. The flesh and blood of an Ascended, even a former one, is enough for a long while.&quot;\n \nIt gnashed teeth out of frustration. Dissatisfaction. Lifting the bloodied limb gingerly,_ to prevent waste_, It reasoned, the feeding began. After all, even if in anger, there is something important It would lose if contaminated, which was even more ire-inducing than feeding on a worthy rival in a trap.\n \n&quot;Don&#039;t look so sad, you nitwit,&quot; she coughed out, lifting the hand that is not gnawed at onto Its head with a gentle squeeze. &quot;It&#039;ll take a lot more than this to kill me.&quot;\n \nSad.\n \nWas It sad?\n \n&quot;No.&quot; It rasped out. &quot;You misunderstand. I have no concept of sadness. You are merely a convenient food and knowledge source. Losing that would impact my future possibility of survival.&quot;\n \n&quot;You liar.&quot; Fondly, she continued ruffling the owl feathers on Its head that she once requested with shining eyes.\n \n&quot;&hellip;.I must have come to mimic your bad habits, then.&quot;\n \n&quot;Hey, don&#039;t go around and point out unnecessary truths! The skill to lie is a practiced skill, never a bad habit. What If I told you the truth, that you are fat and ugly and deserves to be- to be in a- &hellip;.&hellip;.pond! A duck pond!&quot;\n \n&quot;That is why it is a bad habit. You do realize that my weight is lesser than yours, right?&quot;\n \n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n \nThere was truth in her words when she laughed that there would be no remains to trouble him with if she died.\n \nHe stared at her fading body, cradling what little remains intact with claws of a falcon he gained on their recent hunt. &quot;Kha&#039;zix.&quot; He called out, holding a little closer. &quot;Kha.&quot;\n \n&quot;You&#039;ve got the recipe book all packed, right?&quot; She began, as her torso, too, began to crack and shatter at the seams. &quot;The maps we marked, the list of hunting ground and techniques, oh, and I made some of your favorite peach cans! They are unbelievably easy, you realize? You just have to-&quot;\n \n&quot;Yes.&quot; Nodding, he cut her off. &quot;You do realize that I have grown, right?&quot;\n \n&quot;Ahaha. I remember that just a while ago, you were this little troublesome midget who tried at every opportunity to murder me! Time is cruel&hellip;&quot;\n \n&quot;Kha-&quot;\n \nA finger to teeth cut him off. &quot;I&#039;m a witch, remember?&quot; Her smile was a little gentler. &quot;Witches don&#039;t have names. All they exist to do is to be burnt and forgotten, so they have never needed names. Since I don&#039;t need it now&hellip;&quot; Once again, she patted the unchanged owl-like head, &quot;I&#039;ll give it to you. After all, it&#039;s the only thing left that I can give away. But still, why are you so stubborn on not deciding a name for yourself?&quot;\n \n&quot;&hellip;I thought you said that witches needs a lot more to be killed.&quot;\n \n&quot;You still remember that? Seriously, your memory must be better than mine now! Never thought that was possible for Voidreavers. As expected of my pride and joy, Kha&#039;zix Junior...&quot;\n \n&quot;I&#039;m happy to have the name, but calling me Junior is going a bit far, isn&#039;t it? We are not too far off in age, and I have long surpassed you in height and even weight.&quot;\n \n&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;\n \n&quot;&hellip;You know, I wanted you to give me a name. Something that would defines my existence. I suppose it is only fitting that I receive yours.&quot;\n \n&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;\n \n&quot;&hellip;&hellip;..I will definitely prevent any deterioration to any of my memory and prove that your name, our name, to be unbeatable. Let&#039;s see, will assassinating every major bounty hunter for hire be the best way?&quot;\n \n&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;..\n \n&quot;Or is hunting down more metal dragon hearts better? We only hunted two together in total, and they still weren&#039;t the same as the one you first gave me. Driving them into competition or near extinction, perhaps, will force some better quality. It will last longer, too.&quot;\n \n&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;\n \n&quot;It&#039;s getting cold outside. Strange, it has started to rain too. You once said the desert rarely had enough moisture for cloud formation. It seems that your bad habit of lying never changed.&quot;\n\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n**Setting and additional explanations:**\n \nKha&#039;zix (Witch)\n \n**History**\n \nAn Ascended who stayed with her humans till their fatal ends.\n \nWas the third child to the throne in Shurima in her time, but had the most affinity towards Ascension, the ritual to determine the rightful emperor. For the emperor was as a god, and only those who had the affinity for such could be considered.\n \nHowever, even though Kha&#039;zix&#039;s affinity was high among her siblings, it was still not very high compared to the historical rates. After her two elder brothers died from being at the front of the battle lines against the neighboring countries nearly after one another, she became the first in line to the throne. Due to such chaos and the recent decline of the empire, however, her right to succession was questioned heavily by conniving nobles and priests. This led to civil unrest between three factions, those who supported Kha&#039;zix as the next ruler of Shurima, those who supported her younger brother who had less affinity but higher political profile (due to wavering of faith in the ritual), and lastly those who wish for an independent or different governing system.\n \nSkipping the details of this war due to word and time restrictions, Kha&#039;zix battled her way to her inheritance. Her ruthless but fair modus operati gained grudging respect and approval, and her ability as a ruler was unquestionably high. Her younger brother early on sworn to be firm allies with Kha&#039;zix, and showed no interest in the benefits of the Ascension. He expressed clear intentions of removing the system after Kha&#039;zix, however, as the success rate for each ritual has dropped steadily throughout the generations. Kha&#039;zix backed up this point by revealing that she was infertile and that the possibility of her brother&#039;s children succeeding was low enough to warrant death. Thus, she set up a governing system that was based more on ability and stability instead, (study the government of Augustus for a model.) She remained an excellent ruler up until her affectionately named partner-in-crime Lazrih passed away, when she passed on her political power and disappeared.\n \n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**Ascension**\n \nAscension in this story is a ritual to elevate a human into a god, or a being close to one. The advantages include weather control for crops and lessening storms and disasters, as well as a more fertile land. The Ascended cannot die unless the status is passed on to the next in line. The reason for passing on this title despite the longevity of its holder, is the consequence of being Ascended. Though the body rightfully retains youth and health, mentality starts deteriorating depending on the mental strength and affinity of the holder. The Ascended has difficulty remaining among the humans, or even thinking like one, which could cause moral issues like destroying a village to further the development of a city without a single shred of remorse. When the Ascended or their attendants notice this, the succession ritual begins immediately. Once the Ascended has lost their status, they do not lose their power, but their powers are not replenished after use, which leads to slower healing and less power over time, until their death. The body does not age during this process however, as they are fundamentally different from humans now. Their deaths occur more like when a battery goes flat, one moment they are functioning fine, and in the next, all their functions shut down.\n \nIn this area Kha&#039;zix is abnormal. Though her affinity was low, her mental affinity is one of the highest ever seen, for her core personality and nature of freedom is the most similar to the original god who gifted this ritual to humans on a whim. She survived many thousands of years without her mentality being contaminated or destroyed, while remaining ascended until Azir.\n \nKha&#039;zix&#039;s death was caused by the succession ritual performed by Azir and Xerath. (Though Nasus and Renekton have also performed a similar ascension ritual, their purpose was not to be emperor or king and thus it was innately different.) The ritual Xerath dug up was actually given by Kha&#039;zix during her many travels, as she saw that he had affinity. Xerath&#039;s affinity was actually higher than Azir&#039;s, which caused his intrusion to be a success in the eyes of the gods. If Azir had high affinity, no matter what actions Xerath took, it would have been impossible to usurp one who was accepted by the gods themselves.\n \n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- \n\n**Short Story to accompany -&quot;Way to keep me waiting, you cowardly slowpoke.&quot;**\n \nDawn that day was especially long, now that she thought about it. The stubbornness of the sun was almost identical to this man who clung to life like a leech, and as a result hung on much longer than even her younger loyal subordinates.\n \n&quot;&hellip;.There is one last thing I nearly forgot to tell you, Kha.&quot; The elderly man clasped at thin air until Kha&#039;Zix could no longer bear it and gripped his wrinkled hands tightly.\n \n&quot;Damn it, you were always the late one with important things.&quot; She forced out her usual condescending glare. &quot;&hellip;What is it?&quot;\n \nHis dimples traced the same contours just as they did decades ago, when he stumbled haphazardly into the crowd of her hostile soldiers and found himself at sword-point. It was only out of amusement that she called them off, letting the then infamous con-man to be free from punishment. His shriveled skin, however, marked the change he has seen with years, as her inseparable accomplice and general when her rule was contested.\n \n&quot;I love you.&quot;\n \nShe blinked, and for one moment the world was utterly still and silent, until she chocked out a laugh as she felt the impact of ground against knees, whispering to the hopeless specimen of a human being,\n \n&quot;I already knew that, you idiot.&quot;\n \n \n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**Kha&#039;zix (Witch) Continued -**\n \nAfter the last of those who knew her as a human passed away with an irritatingly satisfied look on his face, she left. As an Ascended, she was free. Oh, of course she knew of those who stuck to their duties and the general moral rights, but she could give a fat rat&#039;s arse about what she ought to do. Her fight was done. Complete. Now that her last reason to remain has finally loosed his grip, she would do what she always wished to do.\n \nAnd that, of course, was to travel. To see the world, every single corner, every single wonder, and every last bit of beauty and hideousness. A stupid little promise she made with several other stupid little idiots with big dreams, gone unfulfilled with duty and war.\n \nSo she went off, seeking hidden treasures, unspeakable secrets, and what he wanted to show her. The world he spoke of was one that had charm in its imperfections, and she supposed that she had enough boredom to give meaning to those words.\n \nThere was one rule, however, that she made sure to not break. Interactions with living creatures were to be kept to a minimum, for the limit of their lifespan would lead to greed and suspicion. (Not to mention when the blue sky carried in their eyes echoed with exasperated laughing of someone who has gone.)\n \nIt was on one of these journeys that she found the rare Voidreaver which hasn&#039;t cut off the sentient heart or knowledge completely. Most ones she met were firm vegans who shied away completely living beings, living in isolation as their component of Void digest themselves from inside out. Ones that she cut down chose to refuse to acknowledge any form of emotion or knowledge, evolving themselves to be as grotesque as possible, rejecting any similarity in structure or mind.\n \nBut this one&hellip;. This one was different. Be it fortunate or unfortunate, this Voidreaver has only consumed a single complex being. One that is not too emotionally developed, either. A child perhaps? Thus, it has avoided being swarmed by emotion, intelligence and pain.\n \nAn exception.\n \nShe could feel the corner of her lips tugging at her cheeks. An exception. An outcast. A Void creature that would theoretically live as long as she could, with enough food to prevent self destruction.\n \nThe moon peeked out overhead, illuminating her now blue locks under her hood. Her pace quickened as the Voidreaver became increasingly interested in tearing apart the figure reeking of power. Catching sharp claws in mid-air, her eyes glowed with mirth as she studied the creature before her, before promptly throwing it against hard stalagmite.\n \n&quot;I&#039;m a witch.&quot; Her lie now rolled smoothly off her tongue. &quot;It&#039;ll take a lot more than that to kill me, midget.&quot;\n \nThat fact she knew all too well.\n \n-Fin-\n \n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n_Be it hanging death by blood loss hunger hypothermia medicine oxygen lack of oxygen by impact lack of vital organs too many organs wrong organs brute force shattering burying rotting consumption burning passage of time never once never once never once did they work._\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**Voidreaver setting -**\n \nEvolution is the main theme of Kha&#039;zix the champion, so I decided to explore it. \n \n**Where did he learn his speech?**\nKha&#039;zix&#039;s quotes suggest that he somewhat absorbs what he consumes. He even jokes about how an optimist does not fit his diet, which means that the personality and other mental traits can be absorbed by Voidreavers. What I thought would be interesting to implement is the element of pain and emotions. In the very beginning, I stated that &quot;Its first thoughts were on how cold it was.&quot; was literal. Until the Voidreaver consumes their first more mentally complex being, they don&#039;t actually have any personality or ability to think, or even ability to feel pain. Take this empty slate, then suddenly flood them with ten people&#039;s information, for example. What would happen? Overwhelming amount of information and possible guilt, or fear of that pain. Thus becoming mostly vegetarians or only sticking to less complex animals for food. (More on this later) Otherwise, shutting down mental capacity for emotion altogether is also possible, to keep feeding.\n \nKhazix in this case was somewhat unique. The witch explains this better than I do in her monologue so read that if you are interested. And thus this is how he developed his speech.\n \nAlso more notes on shutting down mental capacity and the possibility of that. Khazix in game has proven that he can choose his evolutions, which also means he can choose to evolve a certain function backwards as well. You nitpickers.\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n \n**Why does he prioritize speed and isolated kills over pure strength?** \nWhy speed and isolation kills? That does not make sense in some scenarios. Kha&#039;zix&#039;s abilities are highly based on one-on-one combat, especially his passive. (You could build him bruiser but I am kind of ignoring that part for a point.) While the case of Rengar and facing other LoL champions shows that this would make sense, in order to consume the most material he should have more of an AoE based kit instead like Katerina. One has to realize that even within Runeterra, the champions are league are called as such for a reason. They are not the norm. Therefore, Khazix does not often have a chance to fight against opponents of such strength, enough times to evolve particularly into one vs one style. There are even the case like Xayah Rakan. In fact, most of the champions are not alone in their journey, due to the world around them being very much alive, it further does not make that much sense. \n \nTherefore, someone has to have played a role in his evolution. One that makes him feel inadequate to fight in long term combat, and requires inhuman speed and catching off guard to be beaten. Which lead to the creation of the witch, or someone who picks him up with enough incentive to keep him alive. I tried to keep these incentives secret within Khazix&#039;s narrative because it is a secret to him. The witch never speaks of it much, and he doesn&#039;t understand enough to pry. The more brutal and humorous part of Kha&#039;s personality is her influence though.\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n \n**What fuels his desires to evolve and consume? Why?**\nIn the story about the fall of the city to the Void, the narrator&#039;s memories are slowly eaten away by what I presume to be the void. What if this is the cause of Voidreavers&#039; desire to consume? That their own information is slowly lost outside of the Void due to Runeterra rejecting them as they are? This is complete speculation and personal wish fulfilment, but I think that Void and Kha&#039;zix are the most similar out of all the different Void champions. The hunger for constant consumption, and the meaninglessness behind it. Just as information of Runeterra&#039;s inhabitants can be contaminated or lost in the Void, in turn the Void is constantly losing its own identity and information within Runeterra. The very moment the Void comes into existence within Runeterra spells destruction for this very reason. The Void will constantly consume and take in Runeterra&#039;s information to be lost in its stead, to preserve its own identity and existence, while Runeterra will strike back in many forms to try to save itself.\n \nFor Voidreavers in this story, this is the basis for their hunger and gluttony. They are a form of experiment by the Void to see if creatures of the Void or with similar properties can survive on a small scale within Runeterra (The voidlings die after a certain amount of time) and sustain themselves. If Voidreavers existed within the Void, they would not have this contamination, but since they are an experiment they are not allowed to return. Their existence fades away with every second on Runeterra, and they feed on increasingly complex matter to make up for the loss. Dangerous and strong enemies are better than large numbers of weaker enemies like plants because their information while being more numerous, also is more dense and therefore take even longer to dissipate. Instead of 1000kg of plants a day for example, one single champion can last more complex developed Voidreavers for a month or more.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- \n\n**Side note:**\nVoidreavers also due to their evolution through time becomes more complex, which causes more food consumption because more complex matter catches more attention of Runeterra and more resources are spent on dissipating them. This causes a conundrum in which eating to survive causes need for more eating until it spirals out of control and they become mini-Voids in which they have so much information that they cannot remain mobile on Runeterra. (Almost like a neutron star or a black hole in terms of collapse). These are harmless if handled right and can be used for things like easy destruction of buildings through voidlings that spawn off the excess energy. Hence the Zz&#039;Rot portal.\n \nKha&#039;zix does not suffer from the same fate as he has chosen to partially embrace knowledge, and with the help from the witch he knows exactly how much information he needs to consume to maintain his identity. This also explains the speed build unlike becoming bulky like Malphite or Maokai, he is staying at minimum complexity body-wise to control his dietary requirements. More muscle mass is definitely more bulky on the bytes on Runeterra, compared to more compact and complex neurons. Best explanation would be the processing power needed for neural networks (brain) vs hard crunching as many moves as possible every second (muscle or other body components).\n \nThis would also explain the purpose of Vel&#039;Koz. His analysis of matter and everything is to understand and to replicate why the Void is losing information, in order to find another method other than consumption of the entire Runeterra. Consumption, after all, takes a lot of energy, along with processing all the material.\n \nMalzahar would also make more sense in his belief that the Void is a way to save the world. If the Void does consume the world, the world is not destroyed, but rather all information of Runeterra is converted into Void format, so rather it would be rebirth. Perhaps in Malzahar&#039;s definition of good and bad, he prefers the format of the Void. Maybe for him it is like a question of OS on a computer, and not minding to wipe out a hard disk to swap out for new info that is more useful or efficient. Ignoring the fact that people are murdered and all that, that is.\n \n \n**Side Side Note:**\nThe dissapating information from the Void is not destroyed, but rather transformed into raw information to be worked with by Runeterra, and wise-versa. Think of it as a Gb of music on the computer being deleted into empty space to then be filled with cat pictures.\n \n ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**Why does he even have a name?**\nWe kind of, sort of, don&#039;t really get an origin explanation for names of the other Void champions. Kog&#039;Maw and Vel&#039;koz are unique in some way for they clearly have personalities that do not just center around feeding. Rek&#039;Sai and Cho&#039;Gath are all names used uniquely to describe one creature out of the difference void-spawns, which means that these are names humans use to describe them. I doubt the Void itself would give them specific names like these to purposely tell the humans considering Rek&#039;Sai does not even speak. Kind of. Therefore, it would be interesting if these creatures had a hand in their own names. Vel&#039;koz likely named himself after something he liked being a possibility. It is also possible that they are named after someone, or something, that stayed within people&#039;s hearts. What if, the creature themselves was given a name, or took the name from someone? Unlike the other creatures, since Kha&#039;zix constantly evolves, nothing can stay constant about him other than his own name. If he really wishes to not forget and to honour someone, I think the first thing he would use or borrow would be the name itself.\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nIf you have read up to here, I seriously applaud you and give you a lot of thanks. Thank you very much with engaging with this world that I myself quite enjoyed, and if you could leave some advice is is highly appreciated. Flaming my toufu mentality, however, might result in permanent scarring. On my part.","replies":[]}
