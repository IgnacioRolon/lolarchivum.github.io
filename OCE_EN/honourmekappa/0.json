I have just been in three champ selects where the same guy would ban peoples champions making them quit the queue, and he would just put a &quot;:)&quot; when asked why he did it.

It's about teamwork, and banning a champion your teammate has blatantly said he wants to play, is not working as a team. It automatically sets a bad vibe for the game. Obviously you don't HAVE to play the champion you want to, good observation genius, but if you're declaring it you obviously have the intent of playing said champ. So why ban it if your teammate wants to play it?","replies":[{"poster":"JasonWazza","date":"2017-12-01T08:41:52.943+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"IT DOESN'T MATTER, JUST BECAUSE THEY WANT TO PLAY IT, DOESN'T MEAN THEY ARE GUARANTEED TO GET IT.\n\nEDIT: The enemy team can easily take a champion, and if that champion is a strong pick, i don't want them having it.\n\nThe one trick fucking pony's who are bad even on their own champions are generally the ones whining and dodging in these cases.","replies":[{"poster":"HonourMeKappa","date":"2017-12-04T06:09:14.889+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Well you can clearly see I'm not a one trick, so that's irrelevant","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"ThatsMyGoat","date":"2017-12-01T02:26:43.329+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":3,"body":"I've had the same problems a few times.
