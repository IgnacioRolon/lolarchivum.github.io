Riot has created many worlds and places where the champions have come from. Recently I saw the Universe on the League homepage and it was amazing, especially the visions of Demacia and all the other cities. Maybe somehow can connect to the League of Legends at the moment as that could be the arena game mode of the free roam. Just thought it would be a awesome idea. I know it would cost quite a bit and would take a while, but I know I would play that.\r\nThanks, magster","replies":[{"poster":"Project Xayah","date":"2016-11-20T23:06:23.783+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Believe it or not, there are Rioters who've thought about this. I remember a while ago (near the start of last year, if I remember correctly) one of the OCE rioters said they wanted to do an \"Elder Scrolls style\" RPG about Quinn's time in the freljord. Tried finding that post recently but failed (so disappointed about that).","replies":[{"poster":"EzeBlood","date":"2016-12-02T03:50:06.148+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"There was also an idea for a multiplayer PvE RPG set in Runeterra back on the Forums, if someone can find it.","replies":[{"poster":"Project Xayah","date":"2016-12-02T06:43:24.033+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You would happen to be talking about [this](http://forums.oce.leagueoflegends.com/board/showthread.php?t=65726), would you?\n\nI get the feeling you're probably talking about something else.","replies":[{"poster":"EzeBlood","date":"2016-12-03T10:10:45.147+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"No, that's it exactly!

I can see some form of boss fights that could be training. For example depending on who you play you could have like a Freljord map (yes I know about ARAM) where the boss shoots out projectiles for us to train in juking. It'd be cool for it to be lore friendly I suppose, like if you're from Bilgewater it's on a pirate ship and as whoever you could be hitting a target as well as 'CSing' normal pirates and 'dodging' cannon balls.\n\nI dunno I might be getting ahead of myself but I don't think it's gonna be implemented anytime soon since LoL is still mainly 'competitive' based. They'll most likely push things like this to mini-games like \"Cho'gath Eats the World\" or the Poro hooking/grabbing game they had some time ago.\n\nPerhaps they should do what Hi-Rez is and release mobile games/other games where when you get enough progress you can unlock like a ward skin or summoner icon for free.\n\nIdeas, ideas everywhere \n{{sticker:slayer-pantheon-rainbows}}","replies":[{"poster":"magster","date":"2016-11-20T05:51:16.665+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I see what you mean by the mini games.

It would take a while and the cost would be high but it would be an awesome game. But yea, even if it was created, it would't be for a while.

And no I've always dreamed of a League of Legends 'Skyrim' but something tells me due to the sequence of things, the lore might be a bit inconsistent and playing as over 100+ different champions with their own set of lore will be a huge challenge, it's like over 100+ mods on Skyrim or something. \n\nBut still, I'd love a mobile game connected to League somehow where perhaps progress in the mobile game can result in free stuffs in LoL, whether that be hextech loot or Summoner Icons; or go one step further and dedicate a skin based on the mobile game!\n\nBasically SMITE has a god called Nemesis and you can unlock a 'Leona JPF' skin if you play through the first 50 levels of JPF (JetPack Fighter, it's incredibly fun and highly recommended). It could totally be something to do with LoL's arcade skin theme.\n\nBut eh, we're going off on a tangent from the main post. I'll stop now xD","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]}
