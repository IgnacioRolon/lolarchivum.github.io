Hes all about coming in silent and swift, bursting someone and disappearing into the shadows. {{champion:238}} \n\nYasuo is more about flowing in and out of combat, putting out consistently high damage and using windwall and ult at opportune moments. Hes more about dueling and weaving in and out while dishing out damage (Q) and charging his shield. {{champion:157}} \n\nI vote for {{champion:238}} though, but thats because his gameplay fits my play style more and I love tricking people with shadow swapping.","replies":[]},{"poster":"TurtleBrianSwag","date":"2018-04-13T22:35:33.973+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Zed has a higher chance of beating Yasuo.Once lvl 6, zed is rlly op.

In most of my games, both Yas and Zed are banned almost every time. I'd recommend picking up champs that are strong and relatively uncommon. I picked up Heimerdinger a few years ago and have been playing him a lot. Especially after his rework. He's very, very strong and very uncommon. I think he has a 0.3% ban rate at the moment. You can still learn to play Yas and/or Zed, I just think you'll need other options because the opportunity to play either of them will be once in a blue moon.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Phyuc Yiu","date":"2017-07-27T06:15:02.921+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I would probably learn Zed, or stick with Trynd. Trynd is cool. He is fairly straightforward and he can kick a bit of a$$. Both Zed and Yas are currently OP and have been for a while. I have no respect, personally, for people who play Yas. He is just broken. I find Zed a bit easier to play but it would vary for different people. Both classes are better than Trynd TBH but there are alot of scrubs playing both Zed and Yas and its not hard to get decent with Tyrnd and you should defeat a good number of those scrubs. If Yas is getting reworked then he will be nerfed. I personally dont find his mechanic fun either.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Fitzky","date":"2017-07-27T03:28:53.859+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Stay the hell away from Yasuo, Zed is also op because of duskblade atm","replies":[]},{"poster":"CHEESYLEEKS","date":"2017-07-27T01:56:30.405+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Zeds better atm.

Lethality is strong at the moment which factors zed. Yasuo is the most popular champ, and is overplayed.\n\nApart from that I personally enjoy zed more.
