Only way to avoid restrictions.\n\n100% True\nI went into 2 games. Not this account but another.\nIn one game I completely owned up. I went like 22 to 1 KDA. Full aussie toxic. Calling everyone drongos. People that need to be taken out the back and shot and so on. The FULL AUSSIE TOXIC!\n\nThen on the next game. I went 1 to 22. Calling them all the same things I said before again.\nOnly thing that changed from the game I owned up to the game I didnt. Was the amount of people reporting me. \n\nRiot / Green posters and so on claim \" It isn't about how many that reported you. It is about what you said \"...\nThis is a load of dog crap. It is 100% based on the amount of people reporting. \n\nOnly way not to be ban now days no matter.. /muteall. They cannot ban what they cannot see. I have proven this before also. I inted on another account for over 100 games every time I played it. Then finally it got ban.\n\n100 games later mind you. But hey.. Stick by this auto ban system riot.","replies":[{"poster":"Essembie","date":"2018-10-26T07:04:42.871+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"it is a sad situation but it is what it is.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Troll LoLoLoLoL","date":"2018-10-10T05:36:07.147+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"Any form of requesting teammates or other players to be reported distracts from the game and shifts the focus to more negative behavior.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Troll LoLoLoLoL","date":"2018-10-09T23:17:55.963+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"This is the answer I got to my ticket. \n\nAsking to report your teammates for something over and over again can take the focus away from the game and trying to win. If someone is being negative in game, asking your teammates to report the specific player one time towards the end is sufficient.\n\nLOL Seriously? In Game 1 I asked in game to report the cait twice during the game and once at the end. In Game 2 I asked twice during the game, once for CG and once for Cairandoherty, then once again at the end.\nI would hardly call that over and over.\n\nSo guys, don't mention to report someone during a game, it can lead to your account being perma banned.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Troll LoLoLoLoL","date":"2018-10-09T03:45:54.749+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"I'm only pissed off because I know the next punishment is 14 day ban, then perma.
