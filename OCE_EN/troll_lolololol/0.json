Since it is a severe disregard for the Summonerâ€™s Code this sort of behavior can result in skipping to a Two week or Permanent suspension. Suspensions of this degree based on negative behavior will not likely be reduced or removed.\n\nThis policy includes (but isn't limited to) things like suicide encouragement (kys and that ilk) and hate speech (racism, sexism, homophobia, etc).\n\nIf you'd like more specific context then you can post your chat logs for community review, but chances are that's what's happened.","replies":[{"poster":"Troll LoLoLoLoL","date":"2019-09-26T08:13:44.116+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"LOL I certainly didn't do any suicide encouragement, or hate speech.\n\nThis community is very toxic, and reports people for no reason at all.

The system is also very good at filtering out false reports.\n\nThe false-positive rate for punishments/escalations is very low, but not non-existent (because that would be impossible).
