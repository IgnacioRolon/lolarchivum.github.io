Also, the stacks won&#039;t refreshed if u would AA (like a {{champion:161}} passive)  without the spinning axes, because {{champion:119}}&#039;s whole playstyle is centred on catching and throwing and kiting successfully, so if u don&#039;t have ur Q active ur passive will not proc.\n\n_New Mechanic: If there is an ally {{champion:122}} on team and the target is afflicted with Hemorrhage instead of applying a bleed from {{champion:119}}&#039;s passive u will instead add one stack of Hemorrhage if there are less than 5 or refresh the duration if there are already 5_\n\nSo what do u think about my idea for {{champion:119}}? are they good or bad or need some re-thinking?","replies":[{"poster":"A steezy Scizor","date":"2016-03-19T01:31:57.472+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"jfc can you learn to spell and use proper grammar before making posts on boards. that was painful to read.\nsecondly, no, dumb idea, leave it as it is.","replies":[]}]}
