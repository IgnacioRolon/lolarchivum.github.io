So here's my position on Vi.\n\nVi is an exceptionally fun champion and I think she is one of the better Junglers out there. She has two amazing gap closers with an exceptional amount of damage without even needing to build damage. Her ult is extremely useful and will certainly turn the tables of a game in your favour.\n\nGood luck!\n\nRegards,\nEuVee [@euveeLoL](http://www.twitter.com/euveelol)","replies":[]},{"poster":"Josh The Locke","date":"2015-09-11T09:34:16.686+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Just saying I am a casual LOL player, I'm only lvl 29 and not really into winning games all the time.","replies":[]}]}
