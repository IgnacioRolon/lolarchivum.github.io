WTF RIOT PLS!!! i {{summoner:10}} {{summoner:10}} \r\nI am a season 5 gold player and I love playing Hecarim with revive teleport. Its not trolling. Its legit. http://oce.op.gg/summoner/userName=L1ghtn1ngWra1th     \r\nI know Riot has tried to remove revive from the past. But why try again? What is your reason behind removing {{summoner:10}} this time? Revive is a fun way of mixing up games. I just love the way you think you've lost a teamfight and then suddenly your teammate flies in, changing the course of the teamfight. Also, what about those youtubers like Phantom Lord? So pls Riot. Don't remove revive. PLS.","replies":[{"poster":"VENI VIDI VICI","date":"2015-02-25T07:56:47.240+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":4,"body":"Because it is fkn troll.
