However rest assured they will respond and the account will be locked as soon as player support gets a hold of the ticket.\n\nAvoid creating multiple tickets about the issue, even if it takes them 48+ hours to respond as this will push you to the back of the ticket queue.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Argonian","date":"2016-06-17T00:27:13.119+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Riot usually doesn't take that long to reply to tickets so i'd say wait a few hours, If you haven't got any reply after 24 hours of your ticket being submitted then resend one.","replies":[]}]}
