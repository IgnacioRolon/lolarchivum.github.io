I dont know, i wouldn't mind.

Bro? If you haven't sort of noticed, she is kind of broken at the moment. Also, Riot have already announced that she is getting nerfed in the next patch (she was actually meant to get nerfed this patch so yeah) so yeah, I don't think that DFG removal is one of your key issues ATM","replies":[{"poster":"DiamondAries","date":"2015-02-21T11:52:35.194+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Turns out her passive is being \"nerfed\". I don't believe it is a nerf at all because 9/10 times she is the one getting the kill right then and there anyway, so yeah, I don't see the point in it.\n\nSo yeah, Katarina's Passive only gives the CD reduction if a champion died within 3 second of her dealing damage to them.\n\nSo say that she jumps onto someone, they flash away, and an Ashe cross-map gets the kill 2 seconds later. it still triggers the passive. However, if a Katarina ults and the enemy Lucian dashes away, and Blitz grabs him, ults him and kills him 4 seconds later, then the passive does not trigger.\n\nSaying that though, when does a Katarina ever not get a kill. I say nerf her hard.\n\nEdit: This is in PBE by the way, so it's not final or official yet, but still...","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Chalze","date":"2015-02-20T23:10:55.287+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You think Kat really needed DFG?\n\nI think you're just bad at Kat and somehow can't deal enough damage without a DFG which she doesn't need at all...\n\n{{champion:55}} {{champion:55}} {{champion:55}}","replies":[{"poster":"SteeI Tempest","date":"2015-02-20T23:42:57.267+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Strider Hiryu,realm=OCE,application-id=FjGAIbRv,discussion-id=e0APsM7a,comment-id=0004,timestamp=2015-02-20T23:10:55.287+0000)\n>\n> You think Kat really needed DFG?\n> \n> I think you're just bad at Kat and somehow can't deal enough damage without a DFG which she doesn't need at all...\n> \n> {{champion:55}} {{champion:55}} {{champion:55}}\n\nI aint a bad Kat at all, i jsut think a sliught buff would help with the players that are so used to DFG","replies":[{"poster":"Chalze","date":"2015-02-21T04:22:48.486+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Wingedkeyboard,realm=OCE,application-id=FjGAIbRv,discussion-id=e0APsM7a,comment-id=00040000,timestamp=2015-02-20T23:42:57.267+0000)\n>\n> I aint a bad Kat at all, i jsut think a sliught buff would help with the players that are so used to DFG\n\nPlayers who use DFG on Kat are noob...\nShe doesn't need a slight buff.
