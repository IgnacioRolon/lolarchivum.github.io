The updated client is still missing a few features (like spectator mode) that we'll be adding over the next few patches. It also doesn't yet have some of the flashy animations that we've been working on. We'll take a few patches to turn things on and make optimisations, so if you decide to upgrade now we'll need you to be patient with us while we work everything out.\n\n{{champion:17}}","replies":[]},{"poster":"BlackBeltBullets","date":"2016-11-10T07:11:08.515+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"yeah they haven't brought all the features over yet... clubs spectate... once everything is done i beleive riot are willing to talk about the possibility of a skins tab in collection and bringing item sets back. they are only gone in alpha because they didnt plan to bring them over from the legacy client","replies":[{"poster":"Groovy Dude 420","date":"2016-11-10T11:25:48.555+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Why would they take away spectate?
