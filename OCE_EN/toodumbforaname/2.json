A quick workaround for this is to have a personal black list that removes these champs from the pool in all random for yourself.\n\nThis is especially useful for players who don&#039;t own many champs and have games where the entire re-rolled champ section is grayed out; where getting a champ you&#039;d hate happens more often.","replies":[]}
