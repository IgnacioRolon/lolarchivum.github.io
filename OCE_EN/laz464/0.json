Now OCE just 2 days ago i got a 14 day ban for swearing in 1 game (normz game) (14day ban) now i can say that this is on the extreme level of consequence as in 4 years of playing i did not get 1 ban and i have done worse then what i did to receive that 14 day ban. so for the whole community to agree we would love to see chat bans come to OCE from NA as they were much better then giving a freaking 14 DAY BAN ON JUST TALKING IN A BAD WAY. \r\n\r\ngiving a perma ban is not the best option is shouldnt even be consided as a thing if your swearing/talking to people in  A GAME just give the people who are rude LIKE ME A CHAT BAN as this is the best option out of a 14 day ban so please riot OCE step your game up and give chat bans as you soonly will find out that everyone will stop playing your game if you dont act on your banning system.","replies":[{"poster":"DarkSoul1994","date":"2017-12-22T12:40:14.302+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"People literally say 'kys' (or the non-acronym equivalent) which is generally an instant ban on NA as soon as someone reports them (reporting players trigger the review).
