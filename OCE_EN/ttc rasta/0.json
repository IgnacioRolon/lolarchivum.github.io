I&#039;ve deranked 3 divisions in the last 3 days. i was s1 90 lp, now im s4 75 lp, i get into promo series and i get inters and feeders. Why? I downloaded lol wiz to see my match ups, im facing gold elo and higher, whilst my team is only lower silver high bronze? how can anyone climb? when i was S1 90 lp, i was in gold mmr, yet all my team mates were either low silver or high bronze, or havnt even played yet this season? I dont know how you expect people to climb when my entire team is a lower rank than the opponents, if my team and the opponents team were equally matched (gold with gold, or silver with silver) i wouldn&#039;t be able to complain, but i get placed with this bronze trash that ints every game, doesnt ward, doesnt itemise well... This game is starting to tilt me way to much. And no, im not saying i play perfectly, however when i finish laning phase i am normally a few kills up with maybe 1 or 2 deaths. I roam when i think i can make an impact, however nothing comes of it even if i do get my lanes ahead, they itemise incorrectly and just end up throwing. If you dont believe me, watch a few of my games from op.gg summener name : &quot;TTC RASTA&quot; and explain to me how i must get out of this shit.","replies":[{"poster":"pedojuice","date":"2017-04-09T08:08:31.351+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"yeah nah nah this never happens to get out of sliver you basically need to have a gold 1 skill level to solo carry games but its totally fair","replies":[{"poster":"69ms","date":"2017-04-11T04:01:45.901+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"So I have gold 1 skill \n ._.","replies":[{"poster":"pedojuice","date":"2017-04-11T19:05:47.614+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"considering you cant solo carry as i said in my comment no","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Broken Scripts","date":"2017-04-09T07:45:05.702+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"If you're not winning games then maybe you're the trash one.","replies":[{"poster":"69ms","date":"2017-04-11T03:59:27.267+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Ayyyyyyyyyy","replies":[]},{"poster":"TTC RASTA","date":"2017-04-09T08:05:54.646+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I was waiting for this comment.

Usually both teams are a mixture of B1, S5 and S4. \n\nIt looks more like you are tilted.

I've never seen such trash in all my time on OCE as what players have been doing the past 2 weeks. It was pretty bad before but now people are just potatoes.\nIt's not that they don't understand the game or how their champion works even. Or the fact that they have no map awareness or macro skills. \n\nJust LEARN HOW TO USE A MOUSE for one thing!\n\nAnd don't play league if you have lag. If you have wifi YOU WILL LAG.\nIf anyone on your internet line is downloading, YOU WILL LAG.\nSomeone in the house watching Netflix online?, YOU WILL LAG.\nBrowser looking up stats on op.gg? YOU WILL LAG.\nLeague needs 100% of your bandwidth, it may be designed poorly, but that's how it is, no point pinging your ping time to your team, WE CAN'T HELP YOU.
