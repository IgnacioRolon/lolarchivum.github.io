Lissandra is more just a mage, like Ziggs. Waveclear, usefull Ult, etc.\n\nLulu wins the game by providing CC, Health, Shields and doing a little bit of damage with her Q. Don't get me wrong, a fed solo lane Lulu can 2 hit an ADC with a Q+E late game but she can also be usefull even if she falls behind.\n\nLissandra with a Zhonyas can be almost unkillable and 1v5 under the right circumstances.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Bytez","date":"2015-01-13T11:42:20.302+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Both champions have completely different play styles. If I was to pick one out of the two, I would pick Lissandra, as she appeals to my play style more. She has quick burst and good mobility, by which I mean it is easy to get around with her E. To be honest, I haven't played Lulu so I wouldn't know much about her, but if you want a Strong Mage who can hold their own in lane and deliver quick bursts of damage, go with Lissandra =).","replies":[]}]}
