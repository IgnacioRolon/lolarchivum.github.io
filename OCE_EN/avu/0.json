The problem is, there are *too* many young/under-developed teens ( even adults in some cases ) who still lack the cognitive faculties of reason - hence, we have this overwhelming consistency of toxicity over being able to resolve our problems peacefully. I've noticed that people are too impulsive, unreasonable and lack the competency of seeing their own flaws. One problem is that people have a tendency to abuse others who are playing poorly - what they don't realize is that abusing this person will only make them play even more poorly, meaning, they are only putting themselves in a worse-off situation when they decide to abuse someone for making a mistake - and they can't seem to realize this on their own ( hence the maturity problem). \n\nIn saying that, I believe that the new system Riot is working on will have complete efficacy in dealing with the problems that we are facing with this community.\n\nThis video will most likely help you understand what's being proposed : \n\nhttp://gdcvault.com/play/1017940/The-Science-Behind-Shaping-Player\n\nChange will come, just be patient and try to not get too distressed with simple-minded people in the meantime.","replies":[]},{"poster":"SEKAI","date":"2015-01-13T03:30:57.974+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"To Riot, Take down the massive pro scene and those crazy ads. Also don't panic nerf anyone who made it into some kind of competition after being dormant for some time, and do NOT hesitate to balance out the cancer even if 100% of the pros mained that POS at some point during their elo climb.\n\nTo community, Stop worshiping pros, stop judging others' picks, stop being one dimensional on the ways to win a game and finally stop caring about arbitrary numbers called ELO, if you're good you will up because the system needs to match you with better people, same with otherwise. So have fun first, e-boner comes second.\n\nNow everybody, we all get a few bit of work to do aye.
