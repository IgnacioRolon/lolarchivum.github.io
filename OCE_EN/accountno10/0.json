They let their flawed bot system auto detect certain words and punish accordingly. Same with reporting, get reported and if the system even remotely thinks you're negative you'll receive a punishment. Meanwhile the troll can act innocent in chat while still feeding or whatever and not receive anything. I guarentee you that 90% of all punishments wouldn't happen if there was a human element and someone could see the whole situation of where it happened whether it be getting frustrated with trolls (human reaction, riot expects us to just ignore them when we're stuck in a 20min+ game minimum and you get punished for it afterwards) or simply that you're with your friends and that 1 random decides to report you even when you weren't speaking to them. \n\nNothing will ever be done, they make a lot of money but hiring or getting volunteers to look over the reports and see the whole situation? Nah, that's not happening, just let the bot do everything! Even when people spend hundreds on skins.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Essembie","date":"2017-12-10T22:08:30.132+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"The system is fucked.
