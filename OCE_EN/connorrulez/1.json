Very few stars could be seen in the above sky, and those that could be were faded by a soft mist that over loomed the city. Darius turned his head to face his younger brother, who was sitting on a wall, one axe spinning in his hand. A grin lay on his face, as he awaited his brother&#039;s response.\r\n\r\n&quot;You killing tonight?&quot;\r\n\r\nDarius&#039; did not meet his younger sibling&#039;s excited look, but rather had a grim look. He was not approving of Draven&#039;s way of doing things, and believed that his morals had been twisted. The way that he viewed killing as sport or entertainment seemed wrong to him. Darius killed for Noxus. Draven killed for fame.\r\n\r\n&quot;Yep. How big of an audience do you think I&#039;ll get? I&#039;m hoping for about a thousand tonight.&quot;\r\n\r\nDraven jumped off of the wall, his outfit, one which Darius had not seen before, was, as always, an unnecessary spectacle for the job which he had. But Darius had long since accepted that he wasn&#039;t an executioner. No, he was an entertainer. He killed to entertain. He dressed to entertain. The way he spoke so confidently was, other than to feed his own ego, to entertain.\r\n\r\n&quot;Why not make it quick and get it over with?&quot;\r\n\r\n&quot;I&#039;d hate to disappoint my fans,&quot;\r\n\r\nHe looked off to the distance, where a crowd was starting to build up.\r\n\r\n&quot;They love it when the prey tries to escape.&quot;\r\n\r\nDarius looked away, slightly disgusted at what his brother now was. Still, he wasn&#039;t going to pretend that Draven wasn&#039;t doing good. The executions, as savage and brutal as they were, raised the moral of the Noxus citizens. Perhaps it was the idea that there were no escapes for the criminals, and that they would always be brought to justice, or just the thought of a man who can so casually strike down many a foe and be so elegant in doing so. It baffled him, but it worked.\r\n\r\n&quot;Who are you killing then?&quot;\r\n\r\n&quot;A couple guys tried to break into the treasury. They&#039;re just nobodies, so I have no idea why they thought they could. Just a few more idiots to put down and a lot more people to entertain.&quot;\r\n\r\nDarius nodded, still not making eye contact with the executioner.\r\n\r\n&quot;Just don&#039;t mess up. We don&#039;t need a couple crooks running free.&quot;\r\n\r\n&quot;Excuse me? I am THE DRAVEN. Put some faith into me, brother.&quot;\r\n\r\nDarius just sighed, and looked up into the sky. The moon was beginning to show over the buildings that littered the city. It was almost time. He gestured to it, and his brother followed his glance, nodding in understanding.\r\n\r\n&quot;Well, time to kill some criminals. You finally gonna watch me? See how amazing your brother is?&quot;\r\n\r\n&quot;I&#039;ll stay for your stupid speech.&quot;\r\n\r\nDraven looked mock offended, and turned away from his brother. He began to spin both of his axes, walking towards the center of the city.\r\n\r\n&quot;You don&#039;t know what you&#039;re missing out on, Darius.&quot;\r\n\r\n-----------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n&quot;HELLO EVERYBODY!&quot;\r\n\r\nDraven stood, eyes twinkling as he looked out at the crowd. This is what he deserved. This fame. This glamour.\r\n\r\n&quot;IS EVERYONE READY FOR A FUN EXECUTION TONIGHT!?&quot;\r\n\r\nThe crowd roared in agreeance. People screaming out Draven&#039;s name, trying to catch his attention, desperately wanting to be noticed by the star.\r\n\r\n&quot;TONIGHT, WE HAVE TWO BROTHERS! THESE TWO TRIED TO STEAL FROM THE NOXUS TREASURY. WHAT ARE WE GONNA DO WITH THEM!?!&quot;\r\n\r\nThe words &#039;KILL&#039; and &#039;EXECUTE&#039; filled the air. Darius watched from the sides. He thought of it as savage. Darius thought of it as recognition. Recognition which he deserved.\r\n\r\n&quot;AND ARE THEY GOING TO ESCAPE FROM DRAVEN?&quot;\r\n\r\n&quot;NO!&quot;\r\n\r\nThe crowd&#039;s screaming blurred into a single entity. They were all ready for blood to spill. And Draven would deliver it. Draven gestured at an iron cage, and had an assistant open it. The two men, who looked to be in early adulthood, took this as there chance to run, going for the one exit they could find. Draven waited a few seconds, then threw both of his axes, as elegantly and with as much finesse as possible. Darius turned and started to walk away, and the entire crowd raised its volume with chanting and cheering.\r\n\r\n&quot;DRAVEN! DRAVEN!
