I still need to do the stats, cooldowns, ranges etc. but I felt it would be best to get some feedback on some things first, like the ultimate scalings (Which are OP, but I'm having trouble balancing.) So here it is.\r\n\r\nGrace, the Rose of the Magi\r\n\r\nPassive:\r\nOvergrowth - When Grace casts an ability, she gains (2 x Level) mana.\r\n\r\nBlue Lotus - Grace starts the game with a Blue Lotus. The Blue Lotus can be used on a ally champion to mana link them, allowing the allied champion to cast from Grace’s mana pool if they’re within range (1500).\r\n\r\nQ - Petal Storm - Ground Targeted - Grace creates a petal storm at the desired location, dealing (15/20/25/30/35) (+5% AP) to all enemies within it and slowing them by 15%. It lasts for 3 seconds.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nW - Screaming Mandrake - Ground Targeted - Grace places a seed on the ground which, after 5 seconds, becomes a Mandrake. The Mandrake reduces nearby enemy champions Attack Damage and Magic Damage by (2%/4%/6%/8%/10%). It lasts 30 seconds and has three health, can only be damaged by basic attacks and only takes one damage from them. (The seed can also be killed the same way.)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nE - Poison Ivy - Targeted - Grace gives an allied champion’s next 5 basic attacks or basic attacks in the next 4 seconds (5/10/15/20/25) (+5% AP) magic damage per second for 3 seconds.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nR - Unenchanting Plantation - Active - Grace starts channeling and draining (30/45/60) (+5% mana) mana of all enemies within 650 range of her. After three seconds, she deals (50/100/150) (100% of mana drained) (+125% AP) magic damage to all enemies within the range.","replies":[{"poster":"minnie002312","date":"2015-03-29T12:10:09.869+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Like the idea of using mana as a damage source... its like the soraka before her rework. Im assuming you are going to make her mana pool pretty big?? Also, i can guess that she is a support; may i suggest at least one defensive ability or some hard cc?\nI have thought about having a champion which is very mana reliant for their attacks so imma just jot down some suggestions (just **suggestions**):\n* have her do extra damage based on current/max. mana\n* her poison ivy should do poisonous basic attacks over time?\n* her w seems like its not doing much... its just a unit with a damage reducing aura (which tbh is not really strong enough to make too much of a difference...) mebe add an offensive component to it or provide extra defensive stats? (eg. tenacity, increases movement speed (like a scuttler ward))\n* i lik how she is like a mana tank (her blue lotus passive) letting her ally to use her mana (FREE BLUE BUFF) there should be an extra interaction with the lotus maybe.... (grants them double mana regen when below 50% mana?)","replies":[]},{"poster":"Sylpharion","date":"2015-03-28T14:14:42.019+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Personally I don't like the way she's designed mainly because her passive would be uncontrollable. What if you want to conserve your mana or you need to, what's another way of doing it. When things get out of hand and you really need to use one of your abilities to kill or escape and boom, your ADC uses some ability and you have nothing left.\n\nHer ultimate seems weird, she's going to need to be one of the last picks in the team to make sure all or at least a majority of the enemy team has champions that use mana. Though mana is used on main champs, Lee Sin Jungle, Zed Mid and Rumble / manaless champion Top can really make a difference since they're such popular picks. Bot lane will always end up using mana but that's if you can get to them.\n\nShe has no real way of peeling for her ADC, she's a very weak version of Zyra. I'd recommend something like Zyra's Q but implemented into a root like weeds growing up and rooting them in place and her W just something completely different, nice champion name though.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Sinceden","date":"2015-03-23T06:33:42.299+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hi, you can tell me this champs ability, skin of what they look like, because I will gladly make a ♠Pivot Animation♠(stick animation) for you :)","replies":[]},{"poster":"Chicken4dinner","date":"2015-03-22T10:26:06.941+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You have a talent for words yet when creating champs it is best to first think about \"WTF is this champ actually supposed to do that can help snow ball us into a win?\" \nWhy is the champ being made, what is the use of it?\nWhat sort of interactions (counter's ect) does this champ have with other champs?\nWhat is unique to this champion and how does this affect how people play her/him?\nWhat is unique to this champion that affects how enemies prioritize and treat you?\n\nI know it's a little excessive and you are just casually making a champ but those are questions you can be asking when playing the game or making the champ (or even taking a dump if that kind of stuff is what you get your inspiration from doing).\n\nYou have a funky vladmier, zyra and pre rework soraka going on here... no offence intended","replies":[{"poster":"ConnorRulez","date":"2015-03-23T05:07:30.132+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I understand what you're saying and agree with you completely, I should probably look at the champion more as a champion and less as a collection of abilities. That said, not sure what you mean by Vladimir, Zyra and Soraka. Only similarity I see between Zyra and Grace is the plant part, not sure where Vladimir comes in and the only similarity between Soraka and Grace is the Blue Lotus passive, which this champion is based around. Maybe if I had more synergy with the Lotus, but I don't want to make a perfect match for Kalista.","replies":[]}]}]}
