You can conquer the whole known world, become ruler of the heavens beyond, but eventually time catches up to all of us.&quot;*\n\n*Constance had never known what was beyond the outside of her village. It&#039;s rolling green hills were equal only to its endless fields of maize, occasionally interspersed with the grazing of sheep and cows. Only a handful of stone and hay cottages dotted the small village, bland in appearance and its residents much the same. Never before had she seen beyond the edge of the maize fields, even as she grew up to become the wife of a farmer herself. While her husband worked the land, she became the shepherd they needed to keep their livestock going. Their livestock and fields needed protecting, and they couldn&#039;t afford to not protect what they had.*\n\n*Her husband, working the maize fields, never saw what happened to his wife that day. Constance herself did not realise what had happened until much later on. As she headed out that morning to go move the sheep to a new paddock, everything seemed normal; great in fact. The weather was amazing, the crops were well underway and ready for harvest soon. There hadn&#039;t even been a wolf attack on her flock in months! As she began working the sheep through the fencing, the sound of bleating and barking filling her ears, she began to lose focus as her mind started to wander.*\n\n*A loud cracking sound filled her ears, startling her back to reality. The first thing that she noticed was that the sky was dark with storm clouds, looking ready to burst and drench the lands beneath. The second was that her livestock was gone. She looked around in a panic, desperately searching for her charges. Thinking they had run off, Constance ran back towards the cottage to find her husband. As she crested the hill running, she saw men gathered outside her house, torches in hand and heavy weather coats dressing all of them. She ran towards them, screaming and waving her hands to be noticed above the indomitable thunder rumbling overhead. The men turned towards her, surprise mirroring their expressions. Her husband was there, staring at her in shock. He dropped his torch and began running towards her, and she towards him.*\n\n*Suddenly, he was gone. The villagers were gone. The house, the fields of maize, the livestock - all gone. Constance stared in abject shock at the scene before her: Houses burnt to ashes, blackened pillars the only remaining skeleton of the cottages. Fields had been razed, leaving nothing behind except ashes floating on the wind. It was the dead that got to her: Bodies of villagers and livestock, lying around as if scattered to the breeze. The sky overhead shined a brilliant light to belay the gruesome scene in form of her, and all Constance could do was scream.*\n\n*This wasn&#039;t right. This was the scene of a pillaging, a by-product of war. But there hadn&#039;t been a war since the peace treaty was signed after the last cross-continental war between Demacia and Noxus decades ago! It didn&#039;t make any sense. Constance, deadened by shock and exhausted from the stress of the last few events, collapsed in the ground as she slipped into unconsciousness. When she awake, it was to a warm fire and a blanket over herself. She began to panic as she remembered the last few events of the hours, and got up with haste. Before her, a woman and a child stood, staring at her. The mother smiled and welcomed her to their home, and explained that she found Constance in the street, unconscious. Constance stared on and tried to place the woman, but somehow couldn&#039;t.*\n\n*Constance, ignoring the mother and child, burst outside to the scene she had always known: Rolling green fields, endless rows of maize, several stone cottages dotting the landscape. She looked on in confusion at the scene, wondering how everything could have gone back to the way it had been. She left the family, confusion dotting their faces, and wandered the village in a daze. Her world shifted many times over the next few days - from burning fields to pristine lands. She even saw the land without any cottages or maze, even people. It took several days, but Constance finally worked out what was happening: Time was jumping, and taking her with it.*\n\n*The weeks that followed took a long time to adjust to. Constance got used to the idea of time moving around her, and began to note all the different changes that her hometown was undergoing. She stayed close to home often, hoping to be able to see her husband one last time. After weeks of not seeing his face again, Constance made a decision to do what she had never done before: She left the village. On a search to stop her halt in time, Constance departed the village with a heavy heart full with resolve. She would find a way to bring her back to her time, and she would see her husband again.*\n\n***\n**What are spirits?**\n*&quot;Spirits, you say? Oh I would say they exist, to be sure. Whether you believe in any religion or perhaps you&#039;re particularly attuned to spiritual energy - well, I suppose it doesn&#039;t matter either way. It&#039;s safe to say that many a man has tried to prove the existence of spirits, and its just as safe to say that many have failed in their efforts. However, let me ask you in return; what defines a spirit? A being born out of magic and spiritual energy, born to roam the world? Perhaps it is something we all had in ourselves all along. Maybe it is just a manifestation of our former selves after we depart this world and onto the next one - who could say? I will say though, that there are spirits out there that are just as real as you and I.&quot;*\n\n*&quot;When we often &#039;see&#039; or &#039;hear&#039; spirits, it can often be our mind playing tricks upon us. The blowing of the wind, the shifting of the sand, the glow of a reflection: All of these are things people claim to be signs that a spirit is close by. The question is, are they right? Perhaps they are, perhaps they aren&#039;t. Well, that&#039;s not for me to say, I can only tell you what I believe - and what I believe is that spirits are just people, like you and me, trapped in the infinite loop that is time.&quot;*\n\n*&quot;You may laugh at me now lad, but perhaps you should think before you open your mouth. I mean, what do you truly know about spirits? I&#039;d wager about as much as I, but have a think about what I said. If spirits really are just energy on the breeze, then perhaps that really is the answer to the afterlife that we are all doomed to eventually. However, maybe what comes after death and &#039;spirits&#039; are two different things entirely. Time dictates the spinning of this world, that no-one can deny. Like all clockwork though, it is bound to malfunction eventually. That is where spirits are born from: People thrown out of the continuum of time and into the loops of infinite progression.&quot;*\n\n*&quot;I&#039;d say it is just a freak accident is all. All it would have taken was one step in the wrong direction to slip into a loop. Time is a funny thing in that it is quite difficult to ask it questions - getting a straight answer out of it is rather difficult at the best of times, hah! Look, all I can tell you is that some people have disappeared when they shouldn&#039;t have, and there is no way they got kidnapped or wandered off. Whether or not you believe does not matter to me, there&#039;s only one things that I do believe: That one day I will see my wife again. One day, in the vast cycle of time.&quot;*\n\n\n***\n**Abilities:** \n**Passive:** Immortal Heart\n**First Ability:** Fractured Mind\n**Second Ability:** Decade In A Day\n**Third Ability:** Delayed Anomaly\n**Ultimate Ability:** Temporal Displacement\n\n***[Author&#039;s Note]:*** *Just as a warning, there is a lot of number-crunching involve in Constance&#039;s kit due to her complex passive. I hope you can understand it and how it relates to not just her roles, but her kit as a whole. She is subject to changes over time based on feedback and further thought, as this is just an initial draft of her concept.*\n***\n**Passive: Immortal Heart**\n\n**[Passive Active]:** While out of combat, Constance can choose to alter her age, granting her bonus effect based on the current age she is stuck in. This is done on a bar that appears just above the ability bar, showing a scale between 10 and 70 with her **major ages being 20, 40, and 60**. An arrow is there to indicate what age you are currently in. Once an age-change has been made it cannot be made for another 60-15 seconds (based on level). All base stat increases from her ages increases for every 5 minutes of game time elapses, finding its maximum value after 40 minutes of gameplay.\n\nhttp://imgur.com/a/aNErZ.jpg\n\n**[Age Factor]:**\n\n- **10:** 10-45% Movement Speed and 10-45% Attack Speed. Attack Damage and Ability Power are lowered by 20%.\n- **20:** +7.5-25% Movement Speed and +7.5-25% Attack Speed. All auto attacks Constance makes while at this age will lower the cooldown of **Decade In A Day** by 0.5 seconds.\n- **30:** +6-20% Movement and Attack Speed, +6-20 Armour and Magic Resist.\n- **40:** +10-38 Armour and +10-38 Magic Resist. All auto attacks received by Constance while in this form will lower the cooldown of **Decade In A Day** by 0.5 seconds.\n- **50:** +6-20 Attack Damage, +8-22 Ability Power, and +6-20 Armour and Magic Resist.\n- **60:** +9-30 Attack Damage and +11-32 Ability Power. For every spell cast by any champion within 600 range of Constance, the cooldown of **Decade In A Day** is lowered by 0.5 seconds.\n- **70:** +12-40 Attack Damage and +15-50 Ability Power. Movement speed is lowered by 20%.\n\n>**How Constance Looks At Her Ages:** *Keep in mind, that no matter her physical age her mental age is that of someone at 40.*\n>\n>http://imgur.com/a/s7ykA.jpg\n>\n>- **10:** A young girl who possesses a large stick found under the nearest tree. Her quick nature at this age allows her to move quickly from place to place.\n>- **20:** A young woman in possession of a basic staff. Her agile disposition allows her to strike enemies quickly without remorse.\n>- **30:** A woman who uses a slightly more intricate staff. Although less agility is found in her strikes, she now possesses the fortitude to withstand many attacks that would once have knocked her aside.\n>- **40:** Her natural age in both her physical and mental states. Here she may not be as agile as she once was, but she has built on her fortitude and found strength to brace her actions. A staff of an intricate nature that has a serpent wrapped around both ends of the staff, allowing for heavier blows when striking enemies.\n>- **50:** Starting to show signs of aging, Constance is now losing her physical fortitude. However, she still remains physically able and is backed by an increasing mental fortitude. The intricacy of her staff has grown as the serpent wraps further around the staff.\n>- **60:** Age is beginning to settle in, and Constance has lost all of her physical fortitude. However, to make up for this, her mental fortitude has increased dramatically at this age. Wilting slightly under the weigh of gravity, she still maintains a dominant presence on the rift with her staff, which has now been fully wrapped in the serpent.\n>- **70:** Now fully wilting under the weight of the world, Constance uses her staff to help keep her up. The staff is now sporting an orb on top of its end, encased in the mouth of a serpent. With both her physical and mental fortitude leaving her, all Constance has to rely on now is her intelligence and vast innate magical power.\n\n***\n**First Ability: Fractured Mind**\n\n**[Active]:** Constance causes an excruciating headache to afflict the target enemy champion for 1.25 seconds, slowing their movement speed between 15% and 35/40/45/50/55%. At the end of that time, the target takes 75/115/155/195/235 (+40% bonus Attack Damage; +40% Ability Power) magic damage and are stunned for 0.5 seconds while they recover.\n\n**[Age Factor]:** Your age factors into several aspects of this ability:\n\n- **10:** The recovery/stun duration is increased from 0.5 seconds to 1.25 seconds.\n- **20:** The recovery/stun duration is increased from 0.5 seconds to 1 second, **and Constance gains +20 movement speed on-hit against the target for up to 2.5 seconds after the stun has ended.**\n- **30:** The recovery/stun duration is increased from 0.5 seconds to 0.75 seconds, and the base value of the slow is increased to 20% from 15%.\n- **40:** The base value of the slow is increased to 25% from 15%, **and Constance receives 12% reduced damage from someone inflicted by Fractured Mind.**\n- **50:** Scaling of the damage is increased to 42/44/46/48/50% from 40%, and the base value of the slow is increased to 20% from 15%.\n- **60:** Scaling of the damage is increased to 46/49/52/55/58% from 40%, **and Constance spreads Fractured Mind to nearby enemy minions within 300 range of the target when the stun goes off.**\n- **70:** Scaling of the damage is increased to 50/55/60/65/70% from 40%.\n\n**Cooldown:** 16/15/14/13/12 seconds.\n**Mana Cost:** 60/60/60/60/60 mana\n***\n**Second Ability: Decade In A Day**\n\n**[Active]:** When cast, you may change your age within 5 seconds to one of the **major ages: 20, 40, or 60**. This can be cast while in combat, but the ability cools down at twice the rate while outside of combat.\n\n- **20:** Constance gains an instant 20/25/30/35/40% (+2.5% Movement Speed [Including Items But Not Buffs]) bonus to movement speed and an instant 20/30/40/50/60% (+1% For Every 0.150 Current Attack Speed [Including Items But Not Buffs]) bonus to attack speed, both of which decays over 4 seconds.\n- **40:** Constance&rsquo;s next basic attack will deal an extra 20/50/80/110/140 (+4/5/6/7/8% bonus Maximum Health) physical damage to the target, and 65% of that damage to surrounding targets.\n- **60:** Constance creates a mental barrier around herself for 4/4.5/5/5.5/6 seconds. If the barrier is broken by an enemy champion's spell or basic attack, Constance will react by inflicting them with **Fractured Mind** while she reduces the cooldown of all abilities already on cooldown by 1.5 seconds.\n\n**Cooldown:** 80/75/70/75/60 seconds\n**Mana Cost:** 40/40/40/40/40 mana\n***\n**Third Ability: Delayed Anomaly**\n\n**[Active - Enemy Cast]:** Creates a bubble around the enemy champion, marking them for 2.5 seconds. The bubble will absorb all damage over that 2.5 seconds, and the target has 25% reduced healing during the duration. After the duration is over, the target takes 105/110/115/120/125% (+2.5% Attack Damage, +2.5% Ability Power) of the damage taken as physical damage. This damage cannot exceed 60/65/70/75/80% of the target&rsquo;s current health.\n\n**[Active - Ally Cost]:** Creates a bubble around the allied champion that absorbs all incoming damage for 2.5 seconds and increases healing effects by 20% in this time. After the time has elapsed, the allied champion will take 95/90/85/80/75% (-1.5% Attack Damage, -1.5% Ability Power) of the damage taken as physical damage. The targeted allied champion can die from this, and the credit for the kill will go to the last enemy champion to strike the ally while the bubble was active.\n\n**[Age Factor]:** Your age factors into several aspects of this ability:\n\n- **10:** The scaling on the enemy damage taken is increased from 2.5% to 3.5%.\n- **20:** The scaling on the enemy damage taken is increased from 2.5% to 3%, **and the damage threshold on the enemy is raised from 60/65/70/75/80% to 85/87.5/90/92.5/95%.**\n- **30:** The healing debuff on enemies is raised to 50% instead of 25%, and the scaling on the enemy damage taken is increased from 2.5% to 2.75%.\n- **40:** The healing debuff on enemies is raised to 75% instead of 25%, the healing buff on allies is increased to 60% instead of 20%, **and 25% of the remaining damage taken on an ally cast is redirected towards Constance.**\n- **50:** The healing buff on allies is increased to 40% instead of 20%, and the scaling for damage on an ally cast is raised to 1.75% instead of 1.5%.\n- **60:** The scaling for damage on an ally cast is raised to 2% instead of 1.5%, **and the healing buff and debuff will remain on the target for 2 seconds after the barrier has dissipated.**\n- **70:** The scaling for damage on an ally cast is raised to 2.5% instead of 1.5%.\n\n**Cooldown:** 25/22/19/16/13 seconds\n**Mana Cost:** 60/65/70/75/80 mana\n***\n**Ultimate Ability: Temporal Displacement**\n\n**[Area Cast]:** Constance marks all targets in a [300/400/500 Area of Effect] zone, allied and enemy, for 5 seconds. After the time has elapsed, both allies and enemies will return to the zone they were originally marked in and their cooldowns are reset to the value they were at. If an ally or enemy were to die while this mark was upon them, they would still rewind to the original position and the slayer would not be awarded the kill. Upon being rewound, enemies will find their basic abilities are on cooldown for 0.5/1/1.5 seconds if they were off cooldown before being rewound. This ability does not work on epic neutral monsters.\n\nIf Constance was targeted by **Temporal Displacement** on casting, she will return to the age she was at upon the initial cast. **Decade in a Day** will instantly come off cooldown after returning.\n\n**Cooldown:** 140/110/80 seconds\n**Mana Cost:** 100/100/100 mana\n***\n**Authors Notes:**\n\n**[Breaking Down The Passive]:** When looking at Constance's passive, we notice her age bar is separate into seven ages: 10 through to 70. Between these seven, there are three major groups that have both positives and negatives to their potential playstyle:\n\n**[20/40/60]:** These are your **Major Ages**, where you gain the most unique benefits of Constance's kit. The **20**'s age group aims towards those building Constance into a Slayer, granting her mobility bonuses and moderate sabotage effects to help her assassination potential. The **40**'s age group aims towards those building Constance into a Tank, granting her defensive stats and protection appeal. The **60**'s age group aims towards those building Constance into a Fighter, granting her the base damage stats and repertoire needed to duel enemies. \n\n**[30/50]:** These are your **Middle Age Groups**. These two ages offer a balance between the major ages; granting bonuses that spread over a greater variety of stats that are of a lower base value. The **30**'s age group focuses on retaining a portion of mobility while granting partial defensive stats. Most useful if you plan on building Constance into a Slayer/Fighter. The **50**'s age group focuses on retaining a portion of damage  while granting partial defensive stats. Most useful if you are building Constance into a Slayer/Fighter. Both offer the strengths needed in Slayers and Fighters, but lacks the unique aspects that the **Major Ages** possess.\n\n**[10/70]:** These are your **Outlying Ages**. These ages possess the greatest risk and the greatest reward in their own right. The **10**'s age group increases all speed by an incredible amount, while reducing the damage potential it may incur. Useful for roaming and skirmishing, this role can be useful in establishing a good map presence, but leaving yourself vulnerable to being caught out without any defensive or offensive stats. The **70**'s age group is quite the opposite. By being granted immense power, they can force their presence in a fight by sheer force of will. However, this leaves you open to other slayers as you lack the defensive and mobility stats that the other age groups possess.\n\n**[What The Aim Was]:** The aim of this concept was to stem off of three things:\n\n- **Creating a person with a unique and interactive passive.** I enjoy doing the number-crunching while realising others do not. I know that won't make me popular for reviewers, but that was more for a purpose of self.\n\n- **Creating a woman who can potentially fill a thematical gap of \"An Old Lady\".** This reason sounds ridiculous, but after seeing a post regarding the lack of Elderly champions in League of Legends, I decided to take this and use it as a source of inspiration for my kit and theme design.\n\n- **Revolving around the theme of someone stuck in time.** I have always loved the thought of a concept based around fractured time, and people being stuck within it. I have toyed with several concepts before deciding to work on it with Constance.\n***\nIf you have any feedback, whether it be good or bad, little or lots, feel free to comment below! I love having stuff to improve on, and your feedback helps me work on becoming a better concept designer. Thanks very much for reading, and even if you didn't agree with Constance and her kit, I at least hope your were entertained by it! Cheers all!\n***\n**Edit List:**\n\n- **(21/03/17):** Added (seriously rough) paint pictures to depict the Age Meter and how Constance would look during her Major Ages.\n- **21/03/17):** Changed values on age ranges around. The Major Ages now focus on Mobility (20's), Defensive (40's), and Offensive (60's). The stats on the abilities have also been changed to accommodate for the change in her passive. End-note has been changed to match the changes in her kit. Roles have also been changed to match more suitably.","replies":[{"poster":"CHEESYLEEKS","date":"2017-03-21T11:46:18.883+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"Two words\n\nOver loaded","replies":[{"poster":"KIWl","date":"2017-03-21T20:48:26.992+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Alright, fair enough.
