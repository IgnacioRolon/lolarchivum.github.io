As most people who paid attention in history class would know, he pretty much charted down most of the coastlines of the Pacific Ocean, not to mention all the controversy involving Terra Nullius. Now I don&#039;t know about you, but to me, that puts him in a pretty good spot to be the representative of the Oceanic community(+++).  \r\n\r\nI chose Bard and Captain Hook is because when you think about it, the local inhabitants had not idea what Hook would be saying when he greeted them and often reacted with Hostilities.(++++) Now, think about it, Bard really doesn&#039;t talk at all, well at least in our tongue, and more often then not if you find an enemy bard collecting Chimes, claiming your jungle as his own, what do you do? You try to kill him, or at least scare him off. Notice any similarities? \r\n\r\n- -\r\n\r\nNow I&#039;m going to be blunt here, I have a artistic ability of a blind man doing the Pamplona Bull Run, so I wish I could draw up a little something, but it&#039;d be horrendous and I wouldn&#039;t be too shocked if I got down voted to oblivion. So, I&#039;m going to put 15 years of English to use and try to flesh out this idea with my written talent. The idea is fairly simple, whack a bard mask on a picture of Captain cook(+x5) and have him use a comedicaly sized telescope as his...Weapon...Horn...Thingy-ma-bob? \r\n\r\nFor the Passives, I&#039;m not to sure about what the Meeps would be(+x6) but the chimes could be little Lanterns you find on the ship(+x7).\r\nHis Q could be a Chain-Shot with an accompanying sound effect of a cannon being fired.\r\nThe healing pod could be the same stone surface but with navigation markings on it?(x+8)\r\nI&#039;m not too sure what his portal could be, but I&#039;m going to stick with the Navigation markings because it sounds like something a Navy would use. \r\nAnd I can&#039;t really think of what to do with the ult, I kind of like it the way it is, really. \r\n\r\n\r\n- -\r\n\r\n(+) I&#039;d say patiently but that would be an outright lie\r\n(++) http://cdn.leagueoflegends.com/apollo/content/bard-fanart/Red-Sinistra.jpg\r\n(+++) I really just want to see Bard wearing his hat in game. It&#039;d be goofy as all hell. \r\n(++++) http://sciencelens.files.wordpress.com/2012/10/cook_painting_lynch.jpg\r\n(+x5) Cook&#039;s Fate at Hawaii, for example\r\n(+x6) I&#039;m thinking tiny crewmen throwing their lives away at the bidding of their Captain.\r\n(+x7) http://media.ourboathouse.com/modules/ecs/images/570440102_xl.png?rev=416A\r\n(+x8) I&#039;m not too sure what would be a good replacement for it.","replies":[{"poster":"SteamPowerLemon","date":"2015-08-04T09:20:12.596+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Were aware that his name is James Cook not Hook.\nHe is not from Peter Pan.\n#Checkyourfacts","replies":[]}]}
