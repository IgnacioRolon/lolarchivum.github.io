The moon occasionally allowed to shine as clouds breezed over in the dark sky. On the ground below a group of four men and a younger boy walked with a purposeful stride on the streets on Zaun. But on the rooftops above a dark shadow flowed with only a bright white smile visible.\r\n\r\nThe mission was simple; just bust down a door, rustle up some rich pompous fatty, collect what he owed, profit. Simple. right? Then why did Jardir still have an uneasy feeling in his gut? \r\n\r\n&quot;Hurry up, boy&quot; called Gerald, the leader of this expedition. Jardir shouldered his heavy club and picked up his pace until he was level with Jamie, a short blonde man whose nose had been broken more than its fair share of times. &quot;Whaddya da&#039;dreamin&#039; &#039;bout boy? Focus on this &#039;ere now and ya mightn&#039;t hav&#039; ta swing that there club&quot; drawled Jamie. Jardir just nodded, still unable to focus on much else other than his body practically screaming at him to turn the other way and run.\r\n\r\nBut on the group walked, with deliberate pacing. Through the twist and the turns of the maze that is the streets on Zaun they walked, feeling the cold wind, smelling the factories and filth on the side walks. Eventually the group started to slow until they came to a corner and Gerald singled the group to stop.\r\n\r\n&quot;Right no rubbish this time, we don&#039;t want the guard called. Quick and simple.&quot; whispered Gerald, he turned to the other two in the group addressing them, &quot;Dash and Don, you two take point and deal with the door. I&#039;ll rough-house the fat prick and Jamie and the boy will keep watch. Questions? No? Good. Lets go.&quot;\r\n\r\nThe group broke up with Dash and Dom taking the lead. As Jardir rounded the corner his nerves felt on fire, the hairs on his body immediately standing on end. Jardir froze in the street, his body refusing to move as his breath quickened. &quot;Oi looky &#039;ere boys, the lil one has gotten the frights &#039;as &#039;e&quot; laughed Jamie. Gerald silenced him with a cold look. &quot;What&rsquo;s wrong boy?&quot; gruffed Gerald, annoyed at the delay. \r\n\r\n&quot;I-I uh-uhh, I do-don&#039;t know s-s-sir&quot; stuttered Jardir, his eyes frantically darting around looking for whatever had him on edge. His eyes came to rest on a small box on the other side of the street. It was completely black and Jardir could barely make it out except for a little doll sitting up from out of the box. The doll&#039;s face was twisted in a demented smile and its black button eyes seemed to stare solely at Jardir. As soon as Jardir saw the Jack-in-a-box he unconsciously took a step back. His eyes were ringing with the sound of his own heart as he struggled to tear his eyes away from the toy. Jamie followed his terrified look and let out a bark of laughter. &quot;Ha! He&#039;s pissing &#039;imself over a little doll! Tell me again why ya bought &#039;im along Gerald&quot;. With another laugh Jamie walked to pick up the toy.\r\n\r\n&quot;S-s-s-stop&quot; panicked Jardir, frantically trying to pull Jamie back away from the toy. But the older man shoved him off and continued forward. As Jamie bent to pick up the doll Jardir heard a terrifying sound. It was laughter. But this laughter was different, it wasn&#039;t filled with mirth and joy. No, it was a deranged parody of laughter. It was a sound that instilled fear and dread into even the bravest of men; a sound that promised no happiness, only pain. Jardir whipped his head to Gerald hoping he had heard it too. But Gerald only wore an irritated expression.\r\n\r\nTurning his head back to Jamie, Jardir witnessed as the air simmered behind the bent over man. A shadow appeared in the simmering air and Jardir&#039;s heart near pumped out of his chest. Before anyone could react the shadow planted a long dagger through Jamie&#039;s back, showering the wall in front in blood. &quot;Crap&quot; swore Gerald as he reached into his jacket, pulling out a flintlock pistol and drawing a bead on the shadow. Dash and Dom slowly fanned out and circled the shadow, drawing machetes.\r\n\r\nJardir was still frozen in place when Gerald took his shot. The lead ball curved to the right narrowly missing the Shadow. Instantly the Shadow dispersed back into the air. Its departure was filled with the same manical laughter Jardir had heard before. This time the rest of the group heard it as well. Jardir saw the uneasiness on the others faces as the laughter continued and rose in volume. Jardir locked eyes with Dom for a single second before he saw a jester&#039;s face appear over the man&#039;s shoulder.\r\n\r\nThe face was an exact replica of the jack-in-a-box&#039;s face. Jardir saw the Jester&#039;s smile widen to a disturbing size as the Jester found Jardir&#039;s eyes with is own. &quot;Behind y...&quot; Jardir tried to warn. But it was too late. Dom&#039;s head was already rolling on the pavement, his body dropping like a sack of bricks. A silent scream of horror escaped Jardir&#039;s mouth.\r\n\r\nDash charged the Jester with his machete raised high. The action seemed to take the Jester off guard and Dash closed in closer to it. But as the blade swung it hit only thin air. The Jester had dodged backwards and created space from Dash. Frustrated and off-balance Dash turned around, straight into the blade the Jester had thrown. The dagger sunk deep into Dash&#039;s chest and Dash in turn sunk heavily to the ground.\r\n\r\nBy this time Gerald had closed to gap to Jardir was was violently pushing him away. &quot;Run boy, I&rsquo;ll keep it here. You just get back to HQ and rally the others.&quot;\r\nWith that Gerald turned around to face the Demon Jester. Slowly pulling out a curved sword Gerald eyed the threat before him. Three of his men dead in only instants. Gerald shook with rage and fear. The Jester looked at the man before him with a slightly turned head. It looked almost curious thought Jardir. \r\n\r\nJardir took a step back top start running and tripped over his own feet. Crashing to the ground Jardir raised his head in time to see Gerald fall to the ground, with the Jester standing over him, its smile bigger than ever. Jardir struggled to his feet. He looked at the Jester before, defeated. Jardir stood in place, his legs almost collapsing underneath him with the shakes. The Jester slowly walked toward his new prey. Its laughter reached a whole new height as it surveyed its conquered prey. \r\n\r\nJardir felt more than saw the Demon walk slowly to him. This is it. He was going to die. He knew he should have followed his gut instinct and left earlier. But no here he was, about to be murdered by a creature he knew nothing about for a reason he also did not know. The Jester was almost on him now, its dagger drawn and ready. Jardir was about to die.\r\n\r\nSCREW THAT, screamed Jardir&#039;s mind as he raised the club that was still in his hands with a force majorly increased by his adrenaline. The club clipped the Jester right under its chin completely shattering the bone and forcing its neck back with such force Jardir heard its neck breaking. As the Jester fell to the ground Jardir felt a wave of relief.\r\n\r\nThen the Jester exploded.\r\n\r\nDaggers flew in all directions from the Jesters body. Jardir&#039;s chest soon was a bouquet of blades. Fallen to his knees, Jardir felt blood pouring from his mouth and let out a gargled cough. He felt a presence to his side and turned his head. There stood the Jester. Its smile as deranged as ever, its black eyes still piercing into Jardir&#039;s soul. Jardir&#039;s face twisted in to a look of pain and disgust\r\n\r\nThe Jester leaned down to Jardir and spoke, &quot;Why so serious?&quot; its voice as maniacal and deprived of mirth as its laugh.\r\n\r\nJardir&#039;s sight began to fail as he collapsed forward onto the ground. The last thing he heard was the hysterical laughter of death itself.","replies":[{"poster":"Lady Sylvanas","date":"2016-06-30T03:12:17.936+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"It's good, you painted the scene and illustrated how Shaco attacks really well, I like how powerless regular people are against a Champion, however the story is a little sad because no one survived.  I find its best to let the readers have some 'hope'. Even though cliche, happy endings work better than when everyone dies and the bad guy wins :p \n\n{{sticker:slayer-jinx-wink}}","replies":[{"poster":"xWZDx","date":"2016-07-01T09:44:41.914+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"And then they lived happily ever after in ~~Heaven~~ Hell! {{sticker:slayer-jinx-wink}}","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Oneechan","date":"2016-07-10T21:58:02.885+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Weew you've made Shaco a force to be reckoned with.
