But seriously, when you go 8/0/14 as Ashe. Or 17/1/23 as Ashe, or I dunno.... 22/7/13 as Ashe. And of course win, you should get an S. \r\n\r\nI know that it goes over general ratios of champions over lane, playrates in that lane, average score, but Riot, come one. Surely there should be SOME sort of cap. Some sort of point where you generally need to reach in order to get an S. Something cool like a scaling ratio.\r\nAt least then players would know that they&#039;re not being ripped off for that bezerk 15/0/4, 220 CS, 6 towers destroyed, AD, healing, Nidalee. \r\nAm I so wrong?","replies":[{"poster":"Deep Terror Nami","date":"2016-07-17T15:11:42.240+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"As good as you think you are doing, there are simply too many people doing too much better in one or more aspects of the game. It could be that you need to put more wards down, be a part of more of the total kills, or secure more objectives and do more damage on them.\n\nDon't fret so much about your Mastery grades, just try to improve at your own pace and they will get better naturally. I suggest reading guides for your preferred roles and champions (such as [Mobafire's](http://www.mobafire.com/) guides), watch some high elo streams (like Imaqtpie or Nightblue3), or head over to the **Gameplay & Strategy** board and present your matches and ask for tips on improving.\n\nA cursory glance at your recent match history shows you like to run Teleport and Thunderlords in pretty much every lane. For an ADC you typically want to grab Heal and either Warlord's or Fervor for most ADC's, as they provide better advantages in combat. If you are Support, rush Sightstone first and then swap your trinket for a Sweeper so you can provide maximum vision for your team; even if you aren't Support, keep using your trinket and a Pink for vision control. I personally suggest limiting which roles and champions you play in Ranked so that you can maximize your improvement on them.\n\nThere is certainly many areas anyone can improve, so just utilize the resources I suggested and you'll start getting more S grades in no time :3","replies":[]}]}
