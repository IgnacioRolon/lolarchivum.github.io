Silver 3 is when Bronze players have climbed out of bronze and think they're good so they demand you follow their calls or they'll feed. I've had so many teammates at that elo say effectively \"My way or I'll feed\" and feed just for ego's sake. \n\nSilver 3 players know enough to know that silver 3 is still trash so they don't care about their own ELO - they're more likely to feed or use the old \"I don't care/I'm not trying\" excuse once they're 0 - 4 to make up for their inevitable 2 - 12 score they're going to get.\n\nGold 3 people know enough to know that they're still trash, but far better than average and don't want to lose ELO and risk becomming a S3 so they're motivated to try to win. This motivation also makes them less likely to rage/ego feed. \n\nLastly I played in Plat elo as ADC, I was outfarmed and basically demolished by my lane opponent, I made mistakes, but when I made mistakes my top shen ulted me, jungler TP'd in etc and turned my mistakes into wins.\n\nReply to this thread if you're interested in me helping you get your main higher elo via duo que.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Talon12","date":"2015-06-24T23:43:51.004+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"cuz silver think they are so good, so they try 1v5 and just feed feed feed, they think they are the best (bronze is actually easier cuz some of them can accept they are not good, so they get better), they think kills out weigh objectives and cs (idiots imo) and they don't apply the hard cc to the dangerous foes in team fights (exhaust the fed draven and stun the syndra genious, don't stun the nami who just used all her cc and missed).","replies":[]},{"poster":"JasonWazza","date":"2015-06-24T10:09:56.233+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Easy, just because you can play with and against golds doesn't mean you can play with and against silvers, Silvers tend to be more likely to feed, therefore meaning you tend to actually have to solo carry games over just in gold where you can more realistically actually farm up.","replies":[{"poster":"white guy12","date":"2015-06-24T12:41:45.207+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"^^, A good idea that you should try is playing more snowbally, aggressive champs in lower elo if you haven't done this already :P","replies":[]}]}]}
