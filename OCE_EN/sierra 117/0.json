I used to work in the security industry as a bouncer. We like to classify people as sheep or wolves. The wolves look for a weak target among the sheep. That&#039;s where we come in, we are the sheep dogs, the ones who stand watch, and protect those who are incapable of protecting themselves. Naturally, when I started to get back into League of Legends, support was the role I was best suited for.\n\nIn general, I like to play supports that have good disengage power, think Janna, Nami, and Thresh. I am posting this from my smurf account, so don&#039;t expect to see too many support games on my match history. I am not the best player, but according to LoLking and op.gg I am ranked within the top 20-25% of players in Oceania (and probably the world) being gold IV at around 1550 MMR on this account. \n\nSupport is my favorite role for a couple of reasons: \nYou are the play maker in the bottom lane. In general, the support makes plays in bot. You protect your adc while they farm, apply pressure, and look for opportunities to make plays happen. You can also make plays in the mid lane along with the help of your jungler, but in general stay bot unless you know that your adc will be safe, or is ahead. \n\nYou can stop bad players from feeding. Think of yourself as a babysitter. To carry as support, you need to do your best to protect and save your teammates. The longer you keep your team alive, the more chance you have of winning that clutch team fight.  \n\nFrom around bronze V to mid silver no one wants to, or knows how to support. If you choose support as your main role, you are bound to get what you prefer in 90% of games. If you learn how to support well, you will find yourself crushing your lane opponents.\n\nI am a bit short for time, so there will be more added later. Feel free to add your opinions, and strategies. But for gods sake, if you&#039;re supporting, make sure you protect your carries.","replies":[{"poster":"TeCoolMage","date":"2015-09-02T07:08:00.823+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"When bot lane gets a support who gets enough kills to stop the ADC from ever dying, I'm so happy.\n\nWhen bot lane gets a support who leaves the ADC in 2v1, KSes mid and is too greedy to even upgrade trinket.

They see it as a role that you can't carry with, because they don't know how to carry with the support role. This type of behavior is quite evident based off rank soloqueue and normal games where they have a \"I'm not going support\" mentality (instalocks, threatening to feed/troll). Basically the lack of skill along with the unwillingness to improve is why low elo players generally suck at support, it's also where the concept of elo hell stems from.

Also if that support wasn't there, would any kill have even happened? The assist gold is free bonus gold that wouldn't have existed REGARDLESS who got the killing blow.\n\n Additionally, leaving bot lane to roam/ward does not mean you are leaving the ADC to 2v1, in fact I DO NOT WANT MY ADC TO 2v1, I want them to play far back safely and CS under tower for a moment until I come back so that I can get our team some vision control which is more important than you getting 4 more CS.","replies":[{"poster":"TeCoolMage","date":"2015-09-02T11:17:04.514+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"No, no kill would happen, but the ADC wouldn't have died to 2v1 and his lane wouldn't have been unwarded. I'm not talking about you, I'm talking about players who don't ward at all, and leave lane while it's pushed and the ADC is behind. I've had it happen before.\n\nAlso, I think it's pretty obvious there's no \"get[ting] our team some vision control\" if the supp is too greedy to upgrade trinket or even get sightstone in the first place.\n\nNext time, don't assume I'm talking about you if the first two traits are something you follow\n\nEDIT: TBH, I allow the jg to take all my kills but when the support does it and both bot laners are still with the ADC if tics me off so much","replies":[{"poster":"BadMrFrostie","date":"2015-09-02T12:06:42.833+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Again...

Not sure of a majority of those I see playing ADC are stuck in a role they don't know or they are just bad players but I'll give you some obvious examples you will see in most games.\n\n Support goes to ward and pings be careful... What does the ADC think? TIME TO GO 2v1 and then rage at my support for leaving me there!\n\n Enemy adc is a stronger duelist and has an item lead... Better try to 1v1 this player at every opportunity!\n\n Multiple enemies MIA, better go facechecking the river because blue trinkets don't exist...\n\n Enemy bot is low hp but have summoners and CC under their tower... ADC flashes in and dies to an obvious heal bait... Rages at you for? I dunno not dying too.\n\n I'm sorry but even the most protective bodyguard support champions I play cannot help players who put themselves in stupid situations regularly, if someone is going to feed all you can do is reduce the amount of deaths and hopefully try and get return kills for the stupidity.\n\n Be realistic.","replies":[{"poster":"TeCoolMage","date":"2015-09-02T11:29:24.624+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"Firstly - Protect the ADCs even if they're beyond protecting.\nSecondly - Pinging someone to be careful is vague and probably means \"jg is nearby to gank,\" I understand that the ADC shouldn't 2v1 anyway but just say it in chat\nThirdly - Turn 1v1 into 2v1 whenever possible, otherwise just tell him to farm and if he doesn't listen, let him but peel for him anyway\nOnly the aimed global ulti champs like cait, Xerath, Ziggs or TF take blue... Supports take red after sightstone and ADCs take yellow.\nIf you play a tank support, tank a few hits from the tower PLEASE. Or at least heal with your low cooldown infuse, tide or aria. If nothing can be done, just damage\n\nIt's more realistic to accept that supports screw up just as much as ADCs also. I've seen supports dive while their ADC is too far behind. I've seen supports with full mana and within auto attack range leave enemy laners alone when the ADC is out of auto attack range and OOM, then rage at the ADC for not being fast enough, even though NO ONE died compared to the ADC dying and raging at the supp.","replies":[{"poster":"BadMrFrostie","date":"2015-09-02T12:04:51.944+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Are you the same jungler who ganks losing lanes? There is such a thing as a lost cause and knowing how to spot one and play to bolster the stronger players on your team is far smarter play than trying to hold a gimps hand while attempting to spoon feed them kills.\n\n ADCs should 99% of the time have a blue trinket after the 10 minutes mark(starting with warding) so that your team does not need to face check(especially the squishiest champ on your team).

I should probably not overextend/ go in for a trade/ face check all the bushes\n\nThirdly- Valid point, however in low elo ADCs should always play as if they will get no peel due. Mainly to the fact support is always a last pick role and many wont know how to effectively peel (much like you should play like you will never get ganked/ given buffs).\n\nTrinket point- So many adcs benefit from blue trinket, not just those with global ults. During laning phase in botlane, the support has four wards. One for river, one for tri (usually), one for a bush in lane (particularly if versing thresh/blitz/morg) and usually the pink is placed further up the river. If an adc has blue trinket, they are easily able to help control drag vision, particularly if the drag ward has been swept. \n\nTank support point- Yes, we can tank, but at lower levels and against high CC, the tower dive will probably not be as \"worth\" as you think. Also, while infuse (4 secs), ebb & flow (10 secs) and aria (10 secs)  have \"low\" cooldowns, they do not heal much at lower levels and without ap items, as well as the fact that they take a gargantuan chunk out of mana, something that might not be possible as the mana reserves may have run dry after using spells offensively a second ago.","replies":[{"poster":"TeCoolMage","date":"2015-09-03T08:36:28.640+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Lol in what world is 4 seconds not short? 10 seconds is like godly tier compared to the 12-15 seconds some main abilities have. Either they damage too (ebb), are simply godly amazing 10/10 (infuse) or give a shield (aria)\n\nBlue trinket puts pressure on the support because the ADC should ward a bit too and without the level 9 upgrade it wont be useful at all due to the duration, telegraphed usage and yellow ward just beats blue due to the fact a sweeped ward gives bot lane and jg a reason to go there half of the time so range doesnt matter that much\n\nA tower dive is worth if the support dies and the ADC doesnt, theres the risk of both dying but I honestly think a decently levelled tank support shouldnt die unless the ADC got last pick and doesnt know how to lane (jg mains lol)","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}
