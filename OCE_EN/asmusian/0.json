Just keep playing. Watch pro players and ex pro players stream. You learn a lot from watching other really good players play. Id recommend watching voyboy (mate of mine told me to watch him and ive improved heaps) You probably wont be able to win but you can surprise him by putting up a good fight and maaaaybe getting a kill in if you learn how to pick out a few mistakes. Take that duel with him as a learning experience tbh, its hard to beat experience. Unless you're mechanically blessed and have a genius mind at gaming, the odds of you winning are slim lolz","replies":[]},{"poster":"VENI VIDI VICI","date":"2015-07-21T16:56:02.533+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Play a champ who is strong at 1v1s/dueling.
