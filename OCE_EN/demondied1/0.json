Help!","subforum":"Help & Support (OCE)","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I usually play 1-2 LoL games a day with a couple of friends and we almost always have some fun games. However this morning I received an email saying I received a disciplinary action suspension on my LoL account. I thought this was another one of those scam emails so I booted up lol and tried to log in. Sure enough I am suspended. I went back to the email and all it says is I violated something in the ToS, no specifics were given. I have not left any matches or harassed anyone so I have no clue as to why I am banned? Is there anyway I can contact staff and get this resolved?","replies":[{"poster":"HORSE OF FORCE","date":"2015-02-28T09:47:08.498+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"As Mindstar said, sending in a ticket will get down to the source of why this happened most effectively.\n\nBut we can analyse it a bit here.

They should be able to help clarify the situation for you.\n\nCheers\nMindstar","replies":[]}]}
