Same thing is gonna happen as the start of last season.","replies":[{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2016-11-16T06:54:04.826+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It was a copy paste from me, from the one other post which asked the same question and therefore had the same answer. The release of solo/duo is confirmed this time around, but obviously Riot wouldn't have released flex if they knew it was going to have such a massive problem, so for the same reason they don't want to release solo/duo if it is going to have that same problem. They need to find the fix first.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"JasonWazza","date":"2016-11-15T14:48:18.115+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I mean flex queue is fine once they fix the MMR issues, the main issue is challengers being placed against silvers.","replies":[]}]}
