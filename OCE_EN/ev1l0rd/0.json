The stats and numbers for his abilities and such need some tuning, but the gist of the character is there. \r\n\r\nI designed him to be a full on attacker. He disregards everyone around him and just goes at his enemies. I might tone down his defensive powers to balance his high attack. \r\n\r\nCan I please get some feedback on this please??\r\nSuggestions, tips, ideas, hate even. I appreciate and respect all feedback.\r\n\r\nIf you&#039;ve got to this part, thank you for coming on this page, and thank you for taking the time to read this. I appreciate it :)\r\nFeel free to leave a comment :)","replies":[{"poster":"Lonely Flame","date":"2015-04-24T05:42:02.880+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Change his passive so the cap is increased, kind of like a reverse of Jax. Instead of triggering of your attacks, it triggers off theres.\n\nHis Q needs to have a way longer cooldown or needs to be expensive. Being able to deal large amount of true damage in quick succession would be too broken.\n\nHis W is a bit average. I get what you're going for but it doesn't seem that interesting in all honesty. Try and come up with something else if you can. Also, even though you recognise the numbers need changing, 150 is waaay too much.\n\nAbilities will never have a chance associated with them, so this attack will guarantee apply a bleed. The numbers you've applied for the bleed are incredibly weak. 100 health over 15 seconds is 6.6 health a second. A champ like Cho'Gath has a base health regen of 8.9 at level 1.\n\nHis ult is incredibly broken. If you build life steal on him, chances are he would restore more health than he would lose. And league will never allow a player to kill themselves with an ability unless there is a significantly high pay off, which while this ability is strong, can easily be avoided.","replies":[{"poster":"Ev1L0rd","date":"2015-04-24T06:04:53.807+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thank you for your input and advice, I greatly appreciate it. This is my first attempt so I expected more than a few things needed to be changed. I'll be redoing this character in the near future with slightly better art (just because I'm not happy about some things in his appearance) and now that I've got your feedback, I can work at balancing and fixing his abilities. \n\nThank you again for your feedback.","replies":[{"poster":"Lonely Flame","date":"2015-04-24T08:53:42.438+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"No worries man. The first one is always the hardest haha. When reworking it, try to think 'What does my champion do? What's his theme? And, almost the most crucial, what makes this champ unique and interesting that would make people want to play him?'","replies":[{"poster":"Ev1L0rd","date":"2015-04-24T09:17:13.976+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Alright, I'll probably rework his story and atmosphere. Flesh out his story some more. \nCheers.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}
