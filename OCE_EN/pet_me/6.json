Im looking for someone to duo bot with, more specifaclly im looking for a  **ADC**  that is atleast silver 4+ and actually good at the game and can play more than 2 games a day/night (90% of silver adc&#039;s are just trash at farming or trading IMO). Something like Discord or Skype will help out alot and no one that rage quits or starts flaming team mates after the give up firstblood.  Also i guess i should note i was gold 2 on the last season i actually played rank alot and tried to climb.\n\nTL;DR: Looking for silver 4+ ADC thats not toxic and wants to climb.\n\nMy IGN: Pet Me","replies":[{"poster":"AustraliasFinest","date":"2017-01-08T10:37:22.640+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"http://boards.oce.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/team-recruitment/lVVAZEwG-lf-duo-buddy-to-climb-with-im-not-trash","replies":[]}]}
