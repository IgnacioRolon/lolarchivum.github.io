Client is just stuck saying 'Logging on'. However, when I tether using a 4G connection or connect to a different ISP it works perfectly fine. I have confirmed that other people connected on the foxtel broadband is experiencing the same thing as me, as per discussion here.\n\nhttp://boards.oce.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/help-support-oce/ABxlGZ0d-unable-to-connect-via-foxtel-broadband\n\nI've also performed and provided my network logs yesterday (13/02/15) and sent an email to ocelivereports@riotgames.com but I have not receive any response yet. How do we go about fixing this? Can you please contact my ISP to get this resolved or do I have to contact them to look into this?\n\nLooking forward hearing from you. Thank you.\n\nRegards,\n\niXtian","replies":[{"poster":"HORSE OF FORCE","date":"2015-02-14T08:25:53.259+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You've done basically everything you can aside from opening a ticket. Telling Riot that it's Foxtel broadband that's having problems (that it's not individual) will help others who are experiencing the same thing, and that's selfless. *I didn't even know Foxtel had broadband.*\n\nIf you want a Riot member to read this specific post, though, you might wanna post it on the [Miscellaneous](http://boards.oce.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/miscellaneous) boards instead.\n\nBest of luck!","replies":[]}]}
