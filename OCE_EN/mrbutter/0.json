He's called Krassus - The Winter's Curse.....oooOOOOOoooo (http://boards.oce.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/player-creations/HnYVJaQu-champion-concept-krassus-the-winters-curse)\n\nEdit: Ok ive made some adjustments and put in a lot more statistical detail, i hope u like the new model and i would still really appreciate ur feedback!! :D\n\nName: Scathach\nSynopsis: A lithe assassin with very high mobility and good pursuit abilities, she plays manily as either a jungler or assassin role but can act as a support in a duo lane. Her abilities are split between offensive and defensive attributes and can be used in conjunction to both evade and counterstrike enemy attacks.\n\n-Abilities-\nPassive: Predators Pursuit, When pursuing an enemy with 25% health Attack Damage is increased by 10%.\n\nQ: Evisceration, Scathach lashes out with razor claws and inflicts damage in a tight arc to any closely packed targets in front of her. This effects the far right unit at full strength with reduced damage for any other units.\n\nW: Survival Instinct, Upon activation Scathach leaps straight up in the air and will evade any non-aerial attack for exactly 1 second but is then rooted for 0.8 seconds upon landing. Upon landing Scathach's movement speed is given a short boost.\n\nE: Predatory Pounce, Scathach leaps in the target direction, if she lands on the ground she will simply continue running, if she lands on an enemy unit it will be damaged, becomes stunned for a short period of time and she will remain there for 2 seconds, the ability will be automatically reactivated to leap to another position (the player can choose to stay in the current position by either waiting for the crouch to time out, using a movement command or by activating another ability). Predatory Pounce can be used to leap off walls into another position, if used on a wall movement speed is increased for a short time. If Scathach pounces on an enemy Champion she will crouch and stop on that Champion regardless of the number of leaps left. If her Q is used when crouching on an enemy unit or Champion the attack raduis becomes a full area circle with the same reach.\n\nR: Feral Rush, Scathach dashes toward her target gathering wild magic to temporarily increase her Attack Damage, striking both the target and the 2 closest units (Champions take priority) inflicting grevious wounds, any enemy unit below 45% health will be stunned for 1 second and have their movement speed reduced for 5 seconds, if an enemy unit is stunned the cooldown for Feral Rush is halved.\n\n-Stats-\nHealth: 591.2 (+90 per lvl)                                                                                                                                                                             \nMana: 295.0 (+40 per lvl)                          \nAttack Damage: 56.334 (+3 per lvl)             \nAttack Speed: 0.638 (+2.45% per lvl)        \nMovement Speed: 355\nHealth Regen: 7.56 (+0.76 per lvl) \nMana Regen: 6.56 (+0.76 per lvl)\nArmour: 25.998 (+3.75 per lvl)\nMagic Resist: 32.1 (+1.25 per lvl)\n\n-Abilities-\nPassive: Attack is increased by 10%.\n\nQ: Deals 75/95/130/150/175 (+120% bonus Attack Damage) in a tight arc to any closely packed targets in front of her. Effects the far right unit at full strength with reduced damage 75/95/130/150/175 (+110% bonus Attack Damage) for any other units.\n\nW: Duration in the air is 1 second while the root upon landing is for 0.8 seconds. Hoewever if an aerial attack connects the root time is doubled to 1.6 seconds. Movement speed upon a successful landing is increased by 10% for 2 seconds.\n\nE: Deals 10/17.5/25/32.5/40 (+100% Attack Damage) and stuns the target for 2 seconds. Movement speed boost from a wall jump is for 10% for 2 seconds\n\nR: Temporarily increases Attack Damage by 10% then deals 160/260/360 (+140% Attack Damage) while any enemy unit below 45% health will be stunned for 1 second and have their movement speed reduced by 40% for 5 seconds, if an enemy unit is stunned the cooldown for Feral Rush is halved.\n                                                                \nAppearance: I've attached some images i thought would convey the right atmosphere, but maybe add full on cats eyes and give her some nasty sharp claws, also i imagined her as a teen girl, mostly to keep in line with her lore.... oh and ignore the name in the middle, I screen shot them from a movie :P (hence the incomplete picture)\n\nI can do better with this lore, give the word and i'll flesh it out completely, i just dont want to fill up half this post just for lore :P\n\nLore: Abandoned as an infant in the deep forest after the Noxian army annihilated her villiage, Scathach was taken in by a family of forest cat spirits, ephermeal beings who dwelt in the dense forest and had protected her villiage since its founding. After the destruction of her villiage the spirits swore to protect and safeguard the last living remnant of their beloved villiage. As she grew up with the spirits she began to take on her new families cat like attributes, making her faster, stronger and more agile than any normal human could ever be, she was so young when she was abandoned she doesnt remeber anything from her past life, not that she wanted to surrounded as she was with so much raw natural magic. \n\nHer whole childhood was filled with games of hide and seek with her spirit family, hours of flying through trees and chasing prey, so much so that she was nearly more animal spirit than human by the time she was 8. But there was always that niggling question in herself and the other spirits of the forest... \"Why is there a human here? Where did it come from? Where are its parents?\" Scathach loved her family dearly and they loved her just the same but they knew that her destiny didnt lie in the darkness of the forest, so when she turned 12 they sent her out to discover where she came from and told her to return when she had found her purpose in life. So for the first time in her life Scathach left the forest and began a journey to find her purpose in life, she soon met other travellers and humans for the first time but quickly found that being raised by spirits had changed her to her very core, she was now no longer a simple human but neither was she a spirit and this made it difficult for her to find a place where she belonged. \n\nAfter a number of years travelling, mischief making and meeting new friends she attracted the attention of the League and was invited to come to the Field of Justice to discover her purpose, as well as to avenge the destruction of her villiage by the Noxian Army. And woe unto anyone who tries to stand in the way of her search for her destiny.\n\nFriends: Lulu{{champion:117}} , Amumu{{champion:32}} , Nidalee{{champion:76}} \nRivals: N/A (or Noxus as a group)","replies":[{"poster":"Abyss of Souls","date":"2014-12-15T23:05:05.697+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hate to tell you but the name and concept are the same as a character called Scathach in the *The secrets of the Immortal Nicholas Flamel* series by Michael Scott","replies":[{"poster":"MrButter","date":"2014-12-17T17:23:36.698+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I got the name from TSINF (mostly from her Celtic background) but i actually got the idea from a combo of Catwoman and my love of positiong abilities.
