He uses his cursed body to impale and freeze opponents. He has good Attack Damage output and is very useful in a critical situation where damage needs to be dealt quickly.\n\n-Abilties-\nPassive: Frozen Touch, When Krassus physically attacks an enemy unit he temporarily reduces it's Attack Speed, however this will only occur once every 10 seconds.\n\nQ: Ice Cleaver, An on target ability where Krassus changes his Icicle Blades into a pair of much larger curved blades increasing his Attack Damage, then rushes in a straight line to the target dealing minor damage to any enemy units between Krassus and his target, once he reaches his target he spins around it slashing from all sides. The Ice Cleavers remain for a few seconds and deal extra damage for any physical attack done during that time.\n\nW: Frozen Edge, Krassus crosses his arms in front of his body, channels for 1 second then whips them out sending his Icicle Blades flying out as a skill shot in the target direction. The two Blades travel paralell to each other forming a single thick skill shot, any enemy unit hit by Frozen Edge will be stunned for 2 seconds and dealt initial damage, after hitting an enemy unit or wall Frozen Edge shatters, dealing wide AoE damage and severely slowing any unit within the blast radius for a short time. After activating Frozen Edge Krassus is unable to attack for 3 seconds or until he uses his Q or Ult.\n\nE: Hailing Barrage, A straight line AoE ability similar to Thresh Hook, Krassus jumps into the air, turns on his side in mid air then spins, slicing the ground beneath, in front and behind his original position. If the Ice Cleavers are still active when this ability is actived the reach and damage of Hailing Barrage is increased.\n\nR: Glacial Scythe, Krassus thrusts a wide AoE field of icicles out of the ground surrounding him that impales and roots any enemy units in place to deal intial damage, then creates a massive Half-Moon Scythe which he slices through the field of icicles with, dealing significant damage and knocking up any enemy units caught within the field.\n\n-Stats-\nHealth: 573.8 (+80 per lvl)\nMana: 270 (+40 per lvl)\nAttack Damage: 58.778 (+3.2 per lvl)\nAttack Speed: 0.660 (+2.80% per lvl)\nMovement Speed: 345\nHealth Regen: 6.34 (+0.65 per lvl)\nMana Regen: 7.23 (+0.65 per lvl)\nArmour: 24.88 (+3.5 per lvl)\nMagic Resist: 32.1 (+1.25 per lvl)\n\n-Abilties-\nPassive: Upon a physical attack the enemy units Attack Speed is reduced by 10% for 6 seconds, this may only occur once every 10 seconds.\n\nQ: Increases Attack Damage by 6/7/8/9/10% then deals 20/40/60/80/100 (+60% bonus Attack Damage) to enemy units in between Krassus and the target on intital rush and upon contact with target deals 90/105/120/135/150 (+80% bonus Attack Damage). The Ice Cleavers remain for 5 seconds with the boost of 6/7/8/9/10% Attack Damage.\n\nW: Krassus channels for 1 second, deals 70/95/120/145/170 (+100% Attack Damage) and stuns for 2 seconds upon impact then deals 45/55/65/75/85 (+80% Ability Power) to enemy units inside the AoE. Any enemy units inside the AoE except the initial target are slowed by 45/50/55/60/65% for 3 seconds. After activating this ability Krassus is unable to attack for 3 seconds or until he uses his Q or his Ult.\n\nE: Deals 80/105/130/155/180 (+110% Attack Damage). If the Ice Cleavers are active Hailing Barrage deals 85/120/155/190/225 (+80% bonus Attack Damage).\n\nR: Deals 50/70/90 (+60% Ability Power) and roots any enemy unit inside the AoE, then 2 seconds later deals a furthur 170/270/370 (+180% bonus Attack Damage) points of damage and knocks up any enemy unit inside the AoE.\n\nAppearance: Krassus is covered in jagged sky blue ice, his features are sharp and stark due to his curse which has turned him into a being of pure ice. The latent magic that saved his life glows from within his core as a pristine azure fire, visible as a rippling glow beneath the surface of his skin and in the pits of his brilliant firey eyes. He wears a jagged suit of armour made of ice which is covered in small spikes and sharp edges, while his helmet which is topped with two straight horns of ice and covers the sides of his face merges seamlessy with his head. His weapons, the Ice Blades, are two long, slightly curved icicles shaped like the blades of a sword which are merged with both his forearms and jut out past his elbow to end just over his shoulders. When he changes them to the Ice Cleavers they become much thicker and longer, jutting a good head and a half over the top of his head and curving till they almost meet at their visciously sharp points.\n\nLore: Krassus was a high ranking member of the Frostguared who didnt not agree with the Chief's (Lissandra's) changes to the tribal law, he opposed her changes to their ancient traditions and tried to keep his brethren on an honourable path. Eventually the disguised Lissandra decided it was time to be rid of this dangerous annoyance, she led Krassus out into the frozen wilderness under the pretense of trying to mediate her fellow Frostguard's fears. However when they were far out of sight from the Frostguards home she turned on Krassus and revealed herself as Lissandra The Ice Witch. Krassus attemped to defeat her but Lissandra easily felled him, however instead of killing him she cursed him, condeming him to an eternal prison as a statue of ice...... However neither she nor Krassus knew that in the long past ages of the Rune Wars his line was incredibly gifted in the art of ice magic and that the latent magic inside him eventually woke him from the curse, saving his life but turning him into a warrior of deadly cold unable to feel the warmth of his fellow man. \nNow he seeks revenge on Lissandra for cursing him with a body unable to live with his fellow Frostguard warriors or the love of his life, begining his journey to the League of Legendst in the hopes of using his new found skills to annihilate the witch that ruined his life and free his noble brethren from her wicked path.\n\n\"Those that stand against me will feel the winters bite.\"\n\nAllies: Ashe{{champion:22}} , Udyr{{champion:77}} , Anivia{{champion:34}} \nRivals: Lissandra{{champion:127}} ","replies":[{"poster":"Sylpharion","date":"2014-12-21T00:34:12.599+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I find Krassus a WIP Concept, the way you explained his E didn't really make sense to me and it'd be nice if you could go into more detail.\nI also find Krassus is too stereotypical icy type of champ which icicles falling from the sky and crashing below. I think that your ultimate was in vision of Gray's Ice Make : Scythe. I don't know what to change the abilities to, and I certainly don't know how you could fix it up without going into deep into the Fairy Tail zone but I really like the idea and the concept. It could use some some nerfs and buffs though.\n\nQ:\n\nIt's a really weak %, if you keep it at level 1 it'd be better but I'm expecting you to max this out first. It should be a weaker start but a stronger finish like, 2 / 4 / 6 / 8 / 10 or 6 / 7 / 8 / 9 / 10%. Also the contact damage could be much higher while lowering the ratio, I hadi in mind :\n40/65/90/115/140 (+110% Attack Damage) = Old\n\n90 / 105 / 120 / 135 / 150 (+ 80% Bonus AD) = New Instead of giving him a weak damaging ability and waiting until the late game, it could really give some kick in the early levels allowing him to get a few kills at level 2 / 3 if he combos successfully.\n\nW:\n\nAs an AD champ, this is like a Trundle W, it's not even meant to be here and allows him to be built AP by anyone that likes to Break the Meta like me :D\nI played AP Jinx when only her E has an AP Ratio.\nI find it could be more useful if you make it something like this.\n\n**Clashing Storm:**\n\nKrassus slams his two axes together causing him to be unable to attack for 3 seconds unless he activates his ult or Q, \nStunning everyone around him and causing strikes of lightning to light down breaking the ice around him and sending ice shards everywhere dealing damage from the shards and lightning blasts.\n\nDon't know the numbers yet \n\nE:\n\nRemove the extra damage, the damage alone is scary and as an AD bruiser you're not meant to pop.\n\nR:\n\n130 is a very weak base damage for an ability you want to execute an enemy, make it so if your q is active you proc Clashing Storm when you waste your ultimate since your breaking it, and turning it into another weapon.\n\nAlso I ignored the root part since it's 3 levels for ultimate not 5. you need to change that.","replies":[{"poster":"Sobriquet","date":"2015-01-27T01:03:34.831+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Krassus' E to me sounds like it's a skillshot nuke, but from the front and the back?\nPlease tell me if i'm right or not. c:","replies":[]},{"poster":"MrButter","date":"2014-12-22T17:02:01.890+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thanks loads, i really appreciate the help :) ill get to making some alterations then post the updated version when i can :)","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"MrButter","date":"2014-12-24T14:52:25.080+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"OK, i've put up the rework and i hope u agree with my changes, your input was invaluable Sylpharion :D and just so u know, i consider all my character concepts both past, present and future as Works In Progress, i put my characters up on this forum to share my ideas with other people who thinks League ROCKS! and because i don't believe for a second that any numbers or concept i can come up with will compare with a long time players in game experience.
