My most recent game had a Lux Support and Zilean mid.      Game was even (we might have been slightly ahead).   Some sort of altercation happened between our JG and Mid to make the Mid lane ask our Support if they should throw the game on purpose.\r\n\r\nAnd because this games community is completely unchecked, they did so.  We lost shortly after.    This was deliberate, yet even with a \"Report\" Riot will still do NOTHING.\r\n\r\nI've reported people for telling others (and myself) to KYS and other variations, those people are still playing to this day.    Riot doesn't care about policing it's community for fear of losing a whale who will buy the next skin released.\r\n\r\n\r\nTime to step up Riot.","replies":[{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2019-08-29T12:56:36.018+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Gameplay punishments (griefing, intent feeding, etc) are tricky. They can be slower to be punished than anyone would like because of the nature of intent. It's much easier to determine intent from chat than it is from gameplay. Saying \"kys\" is clear cut, going 1/10 not so much. That's not to say such behaviour doesn't get punished, just that it can, unfortunately, be slower to action.\n\nAs for chat, BS like \"kys\" should always result in an escalated punishment. If it hasn't for whatever reason, that's one you want to pass onto [player support](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/requests/new) to follow up. Be aware though that support can't give you *any* information about another player, explicit or implicit, so you will get a generic \"thanks for your report\" type response.\n\nAs for the monetary perspective, happy consumers spend more money. Anyone with any shred of business sense can tell you that. It's in Riot's *financial* interest to police the community. They lose money by allowing toxicity, so even for the most selfish reason, they do care.","replies":[{"poster":"JasonWazza","date":"2019-09-04T07:16:22.795+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"\"Saying \"kys\" is clear cut,\"\n\nSo question, is saying kys still an instant 14 day ban, or is it chat restrictions or what?\n\nHad someone tell me to kys yesterday, still unbanned today, adding them to try and ask them if they got a chat restriction right now, but i doubt it tbh.","replies":[{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2019-09-04T07:26:58.121+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"It should be a 14-day ban.

If all tribunal decisions had to be reviewed, it sort of defeats the purpose of a tribunal.\n\nAs for paid positions, there is still manual oversight of the system. Ticket appeals/reports are manually reviewed, but it's a much slower process than what the IFS can do. \n\nThe reason they don't manually review everything is partly the time factor (a punishment is a lot more effective if handed out immediately after the offence, rather than days or more later) and also the scale-ability (think about how many reports get submitted every single game, *worldwide*. There aren't that many people to hire, even if they could afford it).","replies":[{"poster":"JasonWazza","date":"2019-09-03T10:33:15.929+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"\"As for paid positions, there is still manual oversight of the system.
