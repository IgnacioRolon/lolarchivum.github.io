Looking at it, it doesn&#039;t make much sense that Talon is going to the jungle. Your new passive is definitely a mid lane tool as it is very similar to an Ekko passive/Vel&#039;Koz Passive. His updated Q allows him to jump into the fight or critically strike his opponent if in melee range. I think most people think he&#039;ll be a jungler i because of his new E, which allows him to parkour any terrain in the game, although the terrain is put on cooldown. This E would be great for ganks but since mid lane ganks anyway, what&#039;s the point of taking him jungle?\r\n\r\nSo is the new Talon still a mid laner or a jungler?","replies":[{"poster":"Lord Sesshomaru","date":"2016-11-04T03:57:08.536+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Every time a new champ comes out, without fail, theres always a bunch of people saying _\"Omg this will be so op in the jungle!\"_\nThey said it with Azir, they said it with Sol, they even said it with Taliyah.\nand every time, without fail, said champion is NOT op in the jungle.\n\nGive it a few days after release, Talon will be back in the mid lane getting shat on by Zeds and Yasuos again.","replies":[{"poster":"Klavinmour","date":"2016-11-04T08:28:19.960+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"I want more jungle champs ;-;","replies":[{"poster":"CHEESYLEEKS","date":"2016-11-04T18:34:50.584+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"you just got {{champion:427}}  ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)","replies":[{"poster":"Lord Sesshomaru","date":"2016-11-04T21:44:03.720+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"For all the flak Ivern gets....\n\nI fuckin love that champion!\nHe is like singed, you just cant be titled at all while playing him.","replies":[{"poster":"Bambooze","date":"2016-11-05T00:27:50.241+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"But you can tilt your opponents AND teammates off the face of the Earth","replies":[{"poster":"KawtYouNow","date":"2016-11-06T09:33:51.514+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I dont understand.

As a jungle, he looks to lack early sustain and clear but aside from that his new kit suits early game ad jungler, perfectly. If talon was still mid his new e, doesn't give him that much mobility in lane and you would see when talon is roaming pretty easily, whereas I feel new talon's main point is he can get to point A to B ridiculously fast, giving him alot of lane pressure and surprise effect. With correct vision he could also counterjungle better than a current shaco or nunu which would make it painful if he get's jungle dominance, because he could camp out the enemy jungler and still gank whilst being near impossible to catch.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Bambooze","date":"2016-11-05T00:26:59.616+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The new E made him more of a roamer, which Riot wanted Talon to be, not specifically turned into a jungler","replies":[]},{"poster":"Fitzky","date":"2016-11-04T23:26:49.861+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I would say both, his e can still be useful when you're mid around mid-late game when you need to chase down fleeing opponents or roam after taking 1 or 2 towers","replies":[]}]}
