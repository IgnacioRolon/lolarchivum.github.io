He&#039;s easily my favourite champion and a perfect example of rags to riches (hobo assassins ftw). Anyway, I&#039;ve been thinking that I need to main two more champions to not be a Talon one trick pony (which I don&#039;t want to be). I was thinking about maining Sivir as the person who wrote a great guide on how to play her (Vapora Dark) also wrote the guide which I used (and still use) for Talon. Kled, as I gave him a shot and did pretty decent with him but I cannot find a good guide for him.\r\n\r\nIf anyone can give some advice and builds on Sivir and Kled, it&#039;d be much appreciated!","replies":[{"poster":"Upsyndrome21","date":"2016-12-19T05:43:49.419+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I play a bit of kled, he isnt that OP but can fit most team comps. One tip I can give you is once you lose Skaarl (Lizard) let your opponent push. Try to keep the minions just on the boarder of your turrets radius and go for an all in once your abilities are read and you have atleast half a bar of courage. You want to use skaarl as a suprise.","replies":[]},{"poster":"SEKAI","date":"2016-12-18T12:49:42.333+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I don't play either of those champs, so soz I can't help much here.\n\nBut if I were to give any advice, you could also give the NA forum a try as well, by posting this topic again in NA Board (no need NA account, you just take your OCE acc there). Not that I have issues with the players here in OCE, not at all, but I think for your benefit, duplicating another post in NA where there are more players and a far more active forum (too active in fact) would allow you to sip though and gather more information you are looking for. I think.","replies":[]}]}
