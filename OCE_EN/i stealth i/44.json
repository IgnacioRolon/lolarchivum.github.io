After weeks of dreading, I have come to except the changes. They aren&#039;t as bad as I thought they&#039;d be. All his AD stats got buffed and he received a very unique ability, parkour. I have been in love with this ability since preseason started but today, during an ascension match, i jumped a wall across the side (not jumping over it but rather sliding across it), and i dodged a couple of skillshots. I repeated this and lo behold, it happened again. Is this a bug or is this legit?","replies":[]}
