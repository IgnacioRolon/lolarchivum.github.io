Many rage-quitted forum lives after the migration to Boards, some moved on and quitted League entirely, and so on so forth. And so the Board has been slowly dragged into what is commonly referred to as the \"death spiral\" with less and less people really come to stick around (I'm also guilty of this, I often get fix for my forum addiction on NA board nowadays....), until it becomes what it is like now, which is a bit cold around here. It's more like a Q&A section rather than a discussion forum now, unfortunately.\n\nBut hey. It's still alive.\n\nI kinda wish there could be an influx of players using Board, or even old crews returning, and get it going like we always do.

Meanwhile on OCE, if you see a post with more than 3 upvotes, you know it'll be life-chanigng.\n\nAlso on OCE it feels like a neighbourhood where everyone knows each other, theres Glenys down the road who always makes way too much lemon curd, Little Billy who's ball keeps coming over the fence, and William who mows his lawns at 5:00am every Saturday. \n\nMeanwhile NA is like a Tokyo apartment block, if you talk to someone one day, and it's pretty much guaranteed you'll never see them again in your life even though they live 3 doors down. \n\nI suppose it's personal though.","replies":[{"poster":"Time Criminal","date":"2017-06-28T00:42:05.427+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Lord Sesshomaru,realm=OCE,application-id=Ntey9fRZ,discussion-id=4lVExAph,comment-id=00080000,timestamp=2017-06-28T00:27:42.343+0000)\n>\n> \n> Also on OCE it feels like a neighbourhood where everyone knows each other, theres Glenys down the road who always makes way too much lemon curd, Little Billy who&#x27;s ball keeps coming over the fence, and William who mows his lawns at 5:00am every Saturday\n\nLike how I see you everywhere on the forums?  :P","replies":[{"poster":"Lord Sesshomaru","date":"2017-06-28T01:10:41.009+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Quite possibly xD","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"CHEESYLEEKS","date":"2017-06-27T02:26:34.109+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Oce has less than 200000 active playerbase so the boards will never be thrivingly active full of daily content worth reading . other then a niche of active posters, most of the threads on this board arnt worth the time\n\nThats why i frequent na these days.

Also I try not to pose myself as a \"troll\" or a \"toxic\" member of the boards but rather an \"anomaly\". Someone who provides a different opinion to others and maybe a different perspective of things, like I explained about Sesshomaru \"balancing the scales\" as he tends to disagree with Riot on a number of occasions where others tend to always agree and \"accept\". I think it's much healthier for the boards when there's more then one perspective on things because it allows others to \"think outside their own opinion\" and maybe even reconsider what they originally thought. I'm being really broad here but you get the general idea. \n\nThe boards is like a small community and I believe arguments/conflict is what helps establish better ideas and ultimately better decisions.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Lord Sesshomaru","date":"2017-06-26T13:24:42.959+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Don't worry, we love you Fitzky! ^^","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Roguestoney","date":"2017-06-26T23:06:47.433+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You're crazy üôÉ","replies":[]},{"poster":"Project Xayah","date":"2017-06-26T13:35:46.653+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> When HeartVine and Roguestoney refused to let the number game die\n\nI *knew* I was forgetting something.
