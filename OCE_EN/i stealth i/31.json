About how infuriating it has become. There are even complaints claiming that by late game, it&#039;s more OP than the old armour pen (**wot**). \r\n\r\nTo be fair, it is true that Lethality is strong and shouldn&#039;t be so readily available on  items such as {{item:3142}} , {{item:3147}} , {{item:3814}}. Although there seem to be nerfs for the lethality given by the Ghostblade are coming, it seems unfair that people accuse Lethality to being more powerful than Armour Pen. \r\n\r\nWhat do you think of Lethality?\r\n\r\nBuff or Nerf?","replies":[{"poster":"Klavinmour","date":"2017-02-16T00:49:23.747+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Lethality is fine as it is.\n\nWhat needs to be changed is that there needs to be more item options.\nSay a Lethality/Crit item.\n(crit items also need more variety)\n\nAnother thing that needs to change is Magic Pen, flat magic pen needs to become Magic Lethality, or some other name.\nAs it stands AP Assassins are quite out performed by AD Assassins.","replies":[{"poster":"Nightjar","date":"2017-02-18T09:57:11.495+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I think there actually needs to be more definition between crit builds on adcs and lethality. Lethality should be for assassins, good against squishies, bad against tanks. Bonus Armour Pen should be the opposite, good against tanks, bad against squishies. Problem is purely adc items are kinda underpowered and too expensive compared to lethality, and so adcs are buying lethality as well to try to keep up and also since in the current snowball fest riot likes to call a meta, games rarely hit lategame where tanks have 300 armour anymore, where lethality falls off, so it's more about chunking into those mixed tank stats and hitting that high hp pool and going for traditional adc builds isn't so reliable anymore.\n\nAdcs need survivability options right now, as well as ways to cut into tanks a little earlier into the game that isn't lethality (bork kinda works to shred tanks earlier into the game but it kinda screws with your buildpath as an adc and it's not that great against assassins).","replies":[{"poster":"Klavinmour","date":"2017-02-18T13:12:21.989+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"BotRK is a fine item and I don't find that it cuts into many build paths, more that only some marksmen like using it.\n{{champion:22}} {{champion:51}} {{champion:429}} {{champion:222}} {{champion:203}} {{champion:236}} {{champion:21}} {{champion:133}} {{champion:18}} {{champion:29}} {{champion:67}} \nOh actually that's most of the marksmen.\n\nIt's really only.\n{{champion:42}} {{champion:119}} {{champion:81}} {{champion:104}} {{champion:202}} {{champion:110}} \nWho don't make decent use of it.\n\nAnd BotRK combined with a Last Whisper item and lethality runes will continue to work well into the late game.\n\n_________________________\n\nA thread I posted a few weeks back went into detail over how ADCs can itemise to counter assassins in the current meta.\n{{item:3812}} {{item:3046}} {{summoner:3}} \nTaking these three on an ADC will prevent any assassin from deleting you, and gives you plenty of dueling potential to out damage them right back and win the fight no problem.\n\nThe only downside is that if you have no reflexes you can't use {{summoner:3}} so if you're below Gold you probably wont survive.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------\n\nSeriously though {{summoner:3}} needs nerfing.\nShreds armour and magic resist.\nSlows movement.\nSlows attack speed.\nReduces damage output.\n\nIt does everything in one, and has quite a low enough CD that anytime an assassin is ready to engage again it's up and ready to go.\nEven in ADC vs ADC fights, it turns the fight HEAVILY in your favour, more so than {{summoner:7}} {{summoner:21}} and still somewhat better than {{summoner:14}} especially when you can apply grievous wounds through items {{item:3123}} .","replies":[{"poster":"Nightjar","date":"2017-02-19T04:21:46.022+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"personally if I'm having a bit of trouble with assassins, I generally buy items such as {{item:3071}} {{item:3156}}{{item:3814}}  {{item:3022}} and if I'm really having an issue with ad assassins (especially the crit ones), I might instead go for a cheeky {{item:3143}}. Cleaver works great lategame anyways on alot of adcs and the extra cooldown really helps, it's also pretty tanky with a fair chunk of ad on it, Maw helps alot against AP comps but sometimes edge of night's spellshield gives better survivablity. Frozen Mallet helps to kite people out and has heaps of hp on it.\n\nEven though randuins isn't a great item on an adc, the crit reduction, the atkspeed debuff (this also helps dueling other adcs) and the tanky stats, make me alot harder to burst down or even just jump on my face and murder me, also the slow makes great self peel if my support is one of those assholes that 'doesn't play support' and just builds full damage and takes my cs and doesn't peel for me and doesn't ward and abandons me during early laning phase (as a support main, these people really grind on my nerves, if you are support and you start a dorans ring and then rush a mejais and want to 'share' cs, I hate you).\n\nExhaust works great against assassins but I feel it's better that the adc takes {{summoner:7}} for the extra health and movespeed and the support takes {{summoner:3}} (against assassin comps) or {{summoner:14}} (against fighter team comps or botlane compositions which are weak to allins like against soraka or if we're an engage combo like leona+lucian vs Caitlynn+Zyra, the extra damage is essential for securing the early lead and not just get bullied out of lane).","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Ovenmitttt","date":"2017-02-18T06:25:24.163+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The problem with lethality is that it is too good not to buy, and is on every item that is always build by anything AD.
