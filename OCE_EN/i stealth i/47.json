He's been one of the worst midlaners with also the highest skill req for quite a while. I understand he was oppressively strong on release but Azir really needs a bit of help now, especially with stealth assassins who can jump him and his reliance on hitting a lategame powerspike which isn't really that much better than syndras and his difficulty getting there.\n\nIn low elo he's basically a guaranteed feeder. In middle elo he won't do so well. In higher elo he's not picked because he isn't very strong.","replies":[{"poster":"Lord Sesshomaru","date":"2017-01-16T22:48:12.539+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Azir isn't weak, he's pretty damn strong, he's just hard to use properly. \n\nAzir stands on a very thin line, the slightest nerfs make him so hard that new players just cannot play him, and the slightest buffs make him an absolute monster in the hands of those who can play him. Which means you cant just throw changes at him, like you can with other champions. \n\nSome champs are just harder than others, thats just the way it is, and that doesn't mean that they should have a bigger payoff if you can play them properly.\n\nAzir in theory, should be a similar power to Garen, both should be able to affect the outcome of the game equally, but just have different play styles, and Azir's style just happens to be harder. \n\nBut just because Azir is harder, it doesn't mean that he should be more powerful. This means that if you buff Azir, yes it will bring all the new Azir players up to the right level, but it will make the proper Azir mains unstoppable. \n\nAs it stands, Azir is just as powerful as other champions _(you even said so with Syndra)_ but he is harder to play, so we don't often get to see his true power, this makes him appear weak, when actually he is balanced. \n\nThats my 2 cents anyway.","replies":[{"poster":"Nightjar","date":"2017-01-17T04:49:07.672+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"all I can say is that in all levels of play, in pretty much every region, he's not popular, nor does he boast even an average win rate. A good azir can be powerful but he's hard to play to that level without a large time investment and for that same investment you could squeeze more power out of more meta picks.\n\nI mean he's been around 42% win rate in platinum and higher elo and one of the lowest pickrates and even though he spiked this patch and hit a much higher winrate, that heightened winrate still is only around 46%.\n\nI know he was a terror in the past, but those winrates and I'm not even starting on what azir is like below gold, that's not just high skill requirement, that's genuinely under-powered.","replies":[{"poster":"Nightjar","date":"2017-01-17T04:55:26.473+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"also looking at the highest ranking Azir mains in each region, you'll see that they'll have high winrates on every champion they play, except Azir.
