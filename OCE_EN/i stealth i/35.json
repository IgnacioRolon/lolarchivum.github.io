You shouldnt get free 1/2 hp bar for missing everything. Most of her \"feels when you finally had a support that could be a god\" will be exactly the same, the only difference is you need to hit them with a spell or aa first, instead of missing every spell and still killing them.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Zatyr","date":"2017-02-18T03:21:23.038+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"TFW i jumped the gun, feelsbadman, my apologies Riot, you actually nailed this patch.....feels like i should at least come say something when u get it right, SORRY GUYS","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"KingDemonic666","date":"2017-02-04T03:27:10.598+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"probably getting \"attemping to reconect...\" just before a decisive teamfight.\nthe reports are ensured :/","replies":[{"poster":"Nightjar","date":"2017-02-04T04:56:20.476+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"yeah or when you are winning but then you have a statewide blackout during your promo game and you know you're going to get reported for going afk midway through the game.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"DarkShade918","date":"2017-02-05T08:49:37.170+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Playing supp with my duo as an adc, steamrolling the enemy bot, then still losing because mid and top went 0/12","replies":[{"poster":"JesusForgotHisGA","date":"2017-02-07T12:20:33.205+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=DarkShade918,realm=OCE,application-id=Ntey9fRZ,discussion-id=u1WwlI3w,comment-id=0007,timestamp=2017-02-05T08:49:37.170+0000)\n>\n> Playing supp with my duo as an adc, steamrolling the enemy bot, then still losing because mid and top went 0/12\n\nMate I have that happen to me 90% of games I play. Normally I win my lanes without much trouble only to get face stomped out of lane pahse cos some utter noob has fed mid lane or top. It's quite pathetic.\n\nInfact, I got so sick of other lanes feeding I decided to play top lane (1st game top in about 6-7 months). Won my lane easily without giving over a single kill and outfarmed the enemy top. I was also up 3 kills on their top lane. Only to find my bot lane is getting fucking rekt! I'm talking 1-11 rekt.\n\nNo matter what you do, no matter how well you win your lane or play the game. It's honestly about pure luck in regards to MM. You can't possibly carry a 1v5 when other lanes feed the enemy upwards of 5-10 kills each.\n\nThat's why I HATE this game so much. Ranked is all about luck and takes nothing into account in regards to personal performance.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"FatedSaviour","date":"2017-02-07T11:19:58.792+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"throughout my years, penta steal via 1 auto attack\npenta steal via jinx ult (GODAMIT JINX EVEN THOUGH I WAS DEAD AS SION, I HAD FROZEN MALLET HIT ON HIM, AND I HAD CLEAVER)\nxin zhao support not support item all ks and cs no exhaust or supporting of any kind + flaming\nflamed at for not getting sightstone and getting face to protect adc (id rather protect from a gank then be a bitch when i see one coming)","replies":[]},{"poster":"A steezy Scizor","date":"2017-02-06T00:15:53.534+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"playing the game.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Sneed","date":"2017-02-05T08:27:06.604+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"having a bard on my team","replies":[]},{"poster":"JesusForgotHisGA","date":"2017-02-04T04:05:54.817+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"I simply played League.

Sure it means nothing really since the chances of pulling a comeback the instant just before you die is minuscule to begin with, and it only happens for my first death of the game, but nonetheless still very infuriating to see.\n* People doing instalock (in norms), afk and intentional feeding all at the same time. I don't get why some people do that, but there are people who're so bored they actually do that shit in game.

I remember some of my first moments as Ekko, in which I struggled to get a penta with him. I probably got about 5 or 6 quadras but could never pull off a penta kill.\n\nBut the most enfuriating one was easily when I pretty much 1v4ed the enemy team, pulling off a sick ult bait. Of course, I head straight for the 5th player, who is willing to give me the penta, but just as I'm about to get it, my fucking team surrenders. Like, wtf???\n\nIt was almost matched when I got a quadrakill as MF with one good ult, and then a Taliyah auto attacked to steal my penta. That shit does like 50 dmg smh.","replies":[]}]}
