I saved my files, including the Riot Games file created when you&#039;ve installed League. I reinstalled League and dumped the back-up files into the new folder but the client won&#039;t boot up. Is there a proper way to do so or do I need to reinstall the whole thing?","replies":[{"poster":"Łæoña","date":"2017-05-09T11:00:24.882+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It is possible. I know a cousin of mine who copied all the file from his computer and placed in my computer and it worked perfectly (but you have to update it ) unfortunately I don't know how he did it. Possibly coping it and pasting it into the folders where the league client gets its data used from.","replies":[]},{"poster":"macro","date":"2017-05-09T00:02:11.803+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"yes there is!! copy the entire LoL files onto a usb and then go to the LoL website on your new PC. install the game but do not run it. replace all the files from C/RiotGames/LeaugeOfLedgends and off you go :)","replies":[]},{"poster":"Akkordian Zoeve","date":"2017-05-08T05:52:57.775+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Uninstall and re-install from the LoL website.

The game is only 4-5 GB. Whereas most people have 20GB +  folders from all the updates and stuff.","replies":[]}]}
