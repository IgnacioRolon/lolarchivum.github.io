So I spent my 5 months of playing League as a boosted bonobo when it came to champions. All the champions I have &#039;bought&#039; are worth no more than 1350 IP and as soon as I hit 1700 IP, it&#039;s the mystery champion shard for me, so most of the Champions I have are from hextech. So, in memory of a friend who has passed on, I want to main Lux as she had been a Lux main herself, but, knowing my impulsive behavior, I&#039;ll probably blow away the IP. \n\nPoint being, I want to know the fastest way of earning IP as I only play one hour a day of league. I want to have 3150 IP, so I can buy Lux ASAP. What is the quickest way of earning IP.\n\nPlease DO NOT take this as a gifting request, I only want Lux to remember my close friend by. If you are feeling generous, go ahead and gift but it&#039;s not what I really want you to do.\n\nEDIT 1: I currently have 1008 IP","replies":[{"poster":"Ing√©nue","date":"2016-12-21T14:25:47.607+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Like BarryButcher has said, ARAM with an IP boost is the best way to go. \n\n* IP boosted (quite cheap in RP)- double IP gains\n* ARAM- Shorter games, can get more in a short space of time\n* Play as a 5man- small IP boost for players playing in a premade","replies":[]},{"poster":"BarryButcher","date":"2016-12-21T02:57:43.504+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"ARAM with an IP Boost.\n\nAlso getting a champ shard is only good for getting 6300 champions.
