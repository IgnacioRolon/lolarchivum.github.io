High damage and reasonably durable as well.\n\nDisadv: Global awareness is a must, mostly single target, can only really go forwards with his skill set.\n\n**Gangplank**\n\nAdvantage: outplay potential, high burst damage, global presence with ultimate. Super high damage and hard to kill\n\nDisadvantage: all of the above comes at a large skill gap, he is super complex and requires constant vigilance as well as a deep understanding. He can be killed easily if you're not on the money with all of your spells and awareness of ganks","replies":[{"poster":"Nightjar","date":"2017-03-14T08:35:53.936+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"also with gangplank, knowing how to use your movespeed to keep well positioned is very important, because overall you aren't very durable, you can take a few hits and you have a cleanse but you aren't a bruiser and if you get caught out of position rip.","replies":[{"poster":"RUSTYtheCASTER","date":"2017-03-16T15:11:19.396+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Absolutely!","replies":[{"poster":"FatedSaviour","date":"2017-03-27T00:46:29.264+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"your missing 90% of the reason to play gp, TEH BARRLZ, ERMAHGWD TEH BARRELZ, you wonder what the other 10% is, well\n0.9999999999% he gets a tri force. 9% the global ult\n0.0000000001% cuz hes a fun champ","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"BarryButcher","date":"2017-03-13T09:21:56.403+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Panth can Jungle and Top and on the odd occasion Mid.\n\nGP is mainly Top but can mid too.\n\nPantheon requires you to snowball your early, play very aggressive and get kills and roam with your ult. Pantheon is very \"noob\" friendly. Everything is point and click (no skill shots) and he is a very simple champion.\n\nGangplank can play aggro if he chooses but can also just farm in lane. There is no pressure on you to get ahead as his damage is really good late game. HOWEVER if you cant hit your barrels, you become 50% useless, so requires practice.","replies":[{"poster":"Talon12","date":"2017-03-13T12:13:46.460+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Gangplank with exhaust mid has been really popular lately, one of the highest picks this patch I think.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"CHEESYLEEKS","date":"2017-03-13T09:17:36.027+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"dank plank","replies":[]},{"poster":"TheDemonEmperor","date":"2017-03-13T08:52:02.486+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"panth is a new player friendly champion.
