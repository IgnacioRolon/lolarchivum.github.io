With above items, that would be +50, so 200.\n200 < 225\n\nIts a nice nerf to \"tank\" Yasuo in particular. Also hurts his lane phase too.","replies":[{"poster":"Nightjar","date":"2017-01-19T03:03:14.813+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"yeah though I'm afraid that if he gets nerfed too hard, riot will try to overcompensate to bring him back and personally I find with meta shifts, yasou isn't as dominating as he was in the past at the moment and even when he gets fed, with the right picks, he's still pretty manageable.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Tomo7182","date":"2017-01-31T03:08:24.194+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"They nerfed the early damage so yasuos maxing e first are punished harder than q.\nYasuo is a snowballing champion so it cuts down his early game (also most yasuos take attack speed runes, so it also changes that a bit)","replies":[]},{"poster":"Sexy Jack Rabbit","date":"2017-01-20T02:52:48.067+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"By nerfing the E you force Yasuo to max Q. \nThat way, he actually has to use his Q to damage you, and not just E all over the battlefield and win the lane that way.","replies":[]}]}
