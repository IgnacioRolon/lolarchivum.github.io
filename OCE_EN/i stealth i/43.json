I like playing him but I don&#039;t look forward to playing him as much as I used to.

But even though i can rotate between them for variety, I still have days where the last thing I want to do is play the same champs I've been playing all year. (or for the last couple of years, in the case of Azir)\n\nSometimes it pays to just take a break and play a champ you don't often play, for a while at least. You come back to your main feeling refreshed and ready to enjoy them again.\n\nGive it a try ^^\nsee how it goes\nTalon wont mind.. he probably isnt the jealous type :P","replies":[]},{"poster":"Roguestoney","date":"2016-12-05T06:22:17.690+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yes.","replies":[]},{"poster":"BladeOfHam","date":"2016-12-05T06:56:48.184+0000","up_votes":0,"down_votes":1,"body":"You feel like trying more champs who have been changed greatly recently, or you are on your path towards giving this game up gradually.","replies":[]}]}
