The good is that other champions that are &#039;weak&#039; can benefit from these buff. The bad is that champions that are already strong, get stronger and can abuse the items, most notably Jayce&#039;s love for armour pen.\n\nIf Riot really thinks Talon is weak right now, they should just buff his kit by tweaking some minor changes. For Example, make it so his ult&#039;s stealth isn&#039;t cancelled as soon as he uses his &#039;E&#039;. or make it so that &#039;Rake&#039; has a shorter delay.\n\nEven though I feel that Talon isn&#039;t so bad currently, I still feel that intended indirect buffs to him can bring some balance issues for other champions as well.","replies":[{"poster":"ROGU3","date":"2017-02-02T04:37:47.282+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I haven't heard or read anything about Riot thinking Talon is weak right now? Dude he's even having success in the jungle. If that's not a sign of a thriving mid laner, I don't know what is xD\n\nThey buffed lethality because it's strength was supposed to be in the early game, crit users typically have to get into their 3rd item before they are a serious threat. Whereas lethality is supposed to make you a serious threat as soon as you pick it up.\nInstead of only getting access to 40% of the stat you're buying in the early game, you now have 60%.\n\nRegardless of the changes, lethality builds are still trumped by crit builds in the late game.","replies":[{"poster":"I Stealth I","date":"2017-02-02T04:49:28.102+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Jungle Talon is seen as 'a troll pick' nowadays unfortunately, although I still play him there because everyone wants to be Faker and play mid.

My mistake.\n\nWith that said though, he hasn't dropped under 50% win rate since back around 6.2, He's countering the people he counters and doing pretty well against those who counter him.","replies":[{"poster":"I Stealth I","date":"2017-02-02T05:40:08.549+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I don't know why Riot consider him weak. Probably because their research is more around the higher elo (PLAT and above). You see, in Bronze, everyone wants to play Yasuo, Vayne, Zed etc. because they can make **flashy outplays** with them whereas Talon can simply just gib the squishy that jumps him with no flash outplay. \n\nTalon, in the low Elos, is a great and strong pick because half the time, no one knows what their doing and feed the assassin and ask why the champion is broken.\n\nAnyway, if you see a Talon jungle, question if he has the skills and knowledge for it, as Talon jungle requires a lot of practise and knowledge. Took me a couple of games to get the hang of it, honestly","replies":[{"poster":"ROGU3","date":"2017-02-02T05:51:38.723+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You are definitely right, in my experience everyone in Bronze will be trying to play solo carries.\nIt's not uncommon to see;\nYasuo\nDiana\nTalon\nVayne\nLux\nOr a similar comp in my games ><\nI always feel so much better about a game when I see a Vi in the jungle, or a Darius up top. \n\nIn a few of the worlds games I have watched, I have noticed that top level jungling seems to be it's own thing completely.\n\nI remember one game I watched (don't remember which teams) the jungler, top and support stayed together and did an entire first clear, took dragon and dispersed back into lanes by about 3:30. It was a very impressive, but it also gave their enemy the gold advantage and they lost in a landslide. lol.","replies":[{"poster":"I Stealth I","date":"2017-02-02T05:57:55.556+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"wait, Talon?
