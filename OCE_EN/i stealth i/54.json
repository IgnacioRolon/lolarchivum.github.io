Just yesterday, I checked his pickrate and found that it had spiked from 4% to 17%. No, I lie in fear of a mirror match. So, why is he so popular all of a sudden and when would this possibly die down?","replies":[{"poster":"Captain Fortune","date":"2017-02-11T02:52:07.042+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Greetings StealthVortex88,\n\nI think that Talon's sudden spike in pick rate might come down to the Hunt for the Blood Moon event that is going on at the moment. Since you are only able to pick out of 20 champions in that game mode, Talon being one of them, it encourages people to try new champions that they might have otherwise not picked or tried. \n\nSo in this case what might have happened is people have tried out Talon in the Blood Moon mode, found him enjoyable to play/done well with him, and thought to themselves that they might give him a try in normal games and see if their enjoyment with the champion still applies. Depending on the outcome of the following games you will have people either going back to their previous mains or sticking with him in their champion pool. \n\n---\n\nSo to answer your second question about it dying down, after the game mode has gone away for Hunt of the Blood Moon, (Which is available from 2/10/17 - 2/14/17 and 2/17/17 - 2/21/17) you will most likely find less people trying out the champion compared to when it was out. \n\nNow this doesn't mean that his pick rate will go back to what it was, in fact it might go up a bit from the original pick percentage because of people finding that they enjoy him and possibly even become a Talon main.\n\n---\n\nIf anything though you can take this as an opportunity. Yourself being a Talon main for a while will run into many players that are new to Talon that you can offer to help improve at the champion. Having friends around you that main the same champion can be really cool because you can theory craft new ways to play or build the champion, and this may be a great time to find some if you would like that.\n\n_If you are going to offer to help people learn Talon though, make sure you offer to help and have their approval first!_\n\n---\n\nI hope this helps answer your question. If there is anything I can clarify on or any other questions you have let me know. Good luck in your games.\n\n~Elam","replies":[]},{"poster":"CHEESYLEEKS","date":"2017-02-11T01:23:59.242+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"https://oce.op.gg/statistics/champion/\n\n4.34%","replies":[{"poster":"I Stealth I","date":"2017-02-11T02:25:57.731+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"PICKRATE, ALL, TODAY, Normal Queue, Summoner's rift","replies":[{"poster":"CHEESYLEEKS","date":"2017-02-11T06:05:46.512+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"hmm my bad.\n\nif feel your pain. my main {{champion:6}} is no longer the least picked champion {{sticker:zombie-nunu-tears}}","replies":[{"poster":"Ceness","date":"2017-02-12T02:10:55.977+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Doesn't Blood Moon count both as being on Summoner's Rift and being normal queue though?","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Project Xayah","date":"2017-02-11T02:00:43.198+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Probably has something to do with Hunt of the Blood Moon.","replies":[]},{"poster":"dragon poo","date":"2017-02-11T01:37:48.733+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Because he is picked top and does everythign a top laner shouldnt be able to at levels 1-18","replies":[]},{"poster":"Roguestoney","date":"2017-02-11T01:20:10.342+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Popular because leathality die down who cares","replies":[]}]}
