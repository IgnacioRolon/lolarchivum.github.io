At least DJ Sona lets you share music, at least Spirit Guard Udyr tries to revamp the champ and at least Pulsefire Ezreal looks bad ass. But at the end of the day, the &#039;Ultimate&#039; Lux skin feels like it was over hyped. Lux is only popular because a bunch of weebs love her Star Guardian skin, case closed","replies":[{"poster":"DipperOCE","date":"2016-11-21T14:27:34.150+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"The ult is alright and the fact that you get to change per game I like it personally and the customization makes it worth the $30 and anything that is considered good is going to generate hype. PFE is pretty garbage for a 3250 skin cause its older, today it would be worth 1350-1820, SGU is again maybe a 1820 worth at most cause people only buy it since the Classis looks like garbage, DJS is amazing and adds a function and adaptability to the skin, so does the new Lux skins. Overhyped? No. It's a good skin but since Lux has so many skins I wish they gave it to someone else.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Willy Donka","date":"2016-11-21T11:35:21.501+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"and she already has enough skins...","replies":[{"poster":"I Stealth I","date":"2016-11-21T20:37:45.035+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Exactly my point","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"4fy9bEOt7y","date":"2016-11-22T05:22:37.920+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It should have gone to Annie.
