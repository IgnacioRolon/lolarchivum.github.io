Your main is basically the champion that is your favourite and most used champion. Many, myself included, have had trouble picking up their main early on. That&#039;s why I have made this guide, so you can pick up your main as soon as you can!\r\n\r\nThere are 2 reasons that a person may pick their main for; competitive reasons and/or fun factor. Let&#039;s go through what you&#039;d look for in each of them.\r\n\r\n**Competitive**\r\n\r\nThe main things you&#039;d look for in a competitive champion is their potential. Many champions have been a strong pick for a long time and it&#039;s because of their flexibility in situations. Champions like Vayne {{champion:67}} , have the potential to become a monster by late game, no matter how bad they did. Annie {{champion:1}} , a beginner champion, is still used by very skilled players, due to how strong she is. However, there exist champions that need a **LOT** of practise to use to their full extent, like Yasuo {{champion:157}} and Aatrox {{champion:266}} . However, when played right, they can **DOMINATE** any game.\r\n\r\n**Fun Factor**\r\n\r\nThese champions aren&#039;t necessarily the strongest of the bunch but provide some really fun games. They have unique gameplay styles that differentiate them from most champions. Although many of the champions that have unique gameplay styles are very recent (Post-2013), they provide some fun experiences. Want to play as a time travelling hood rat {{champion:245}} ? You got it! \r\n\r\nThose are just the gameplay aspect of why you&#039;d want these champs as your main. Lore, surprisingly, plays a huge part in picking your main as well. Although recent champion lore is scarce -.-, you can hit up the Universe Page to explore their lore here:  \r\nhttp://universe.leagueoflegends.com/en_AU/\r\n\r\nBack? Lets keep going, lore helps us know what our champion is like, essentially, their personality. It shows us how they fit into Runeterra (the world of League) . Let me ask you a question, how would it feel playing as a psychopathic sniper who calls himself an artist{{champion:202}}  or even, GOD HIMSELF {{champion:136}} . Lore provides you with story rich details of all the champions and is worth considering for your main.\r\n\r\nThe least important factor, for me at least, is skill. Let&#039;s say you **LOVE** playing a certain champion but you don&#039;t do so good at him and your teammates discourage you for it. It doesn&#039;t matter, if you enjoy the champion, keep playing them, practise makes perfect. But, if you have to draw the line, do so.\r\n\r\nHopefully, you learnt a bit from this guide! If you have someone who has trouble choosing their main and this guide is decent enough, send it to them! Some feedback will be appreciated, thank you!","replies":[{"poster":"Nightjar","date":"2017-01-20T09:42:23.834+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I am not a good person as you'll see by my history of mains:\n\nWhen I first started I mained:\nMid{{champion:74}}, Top {{champion:36}}, Jg {{champion:19}}\n\n\nBut as I got into the game a little more:\nJg {{champion:20}}, Top {{champion:17}}, Adc {{champion:15}}, Sup {{champion:12}}\n\nOnce I started to get a hang of the game I shifted to these champions:\nSup {{champion:26}}, Jg {{champion:35}}, Sup {{champion:40}}","replies":[]},{"poster":"Lord Sesshomaru","date":"2017-01-20T09:13:57.780+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Well said!\n\nI must agree that skill should have the least to do with picking a champion.\nAll champions have a _relatively_ equal potential to affect the game in their select roles. Some champions take more time to learn to achieve that potential, but in the end it makes no difference, you get there eventually no matter who you play. \n\nThe meta changes, Vayne wasn't always the monster she is today, and in the future its unlikely she will remain as strong as she is, and then another ADC will top the charts. \nNo matter what champ you play, at some point they will be strong in the meta, and at others they will be weak. \n\nYou can spend the rest of your lol career jumping ship chasing that extra 2/3% winrate, or you can find a few champs you like and just play them, get really good with them, and then even when they are weak, you will still outplay those who only play meta champs. Then when they are strong again you will be unstoppable. \n\n__________\n\n**For those who are interested, this is the history of my mains:**\n\n{{champion:63}} The first champ I ever played, I was pre 30, my favourite anime character is a fire user, so I liked fire characters, he was fire, I mained him.\n\n{{champion:105}} Starting to learn more about the game, I liked Fizz's play style, you get to jump all around the place, and it was easy to kill people. He also has a relaxed and playful personality, It was nice to play someone who had more lines than the typical \"Ill kill my enemies!\" \"Die!\" \"You cant contain me Summoner!\" etc etc. \n\n{{champion:157}} The day he came out I started playing him non stop. Come on! Yasuo is a badass lone swordsman running from his past, (its the plot of every teenage hero movie ever, _both bad and good_). He is designed to appeal to teens! He is about as mainstream a hero as you can get, which means everyone can relate to him in some way. I love Japan, I love anime, as so many people do. He's easy and fun to play, while still requiring enough skill in order to improve. Yasuo ~~was~~ **IS** the perfect champ. \n\n{{champion:268}} Unlike Yasuo, Azir wasn't teased, I opened league one morning and The Emperor of the Sand's picture was blazoned across the client. I looked at the pre-release videos of him and knew instantly that I was going to play this champ. His personality was more interesting than other champs. How could Riot make you like someone who was so arrogant and cocky, someone whose own self importance doomed his entire nation? I Don't know but they did. \nHe was just so much more interesting than Yasuo (we have heard Yasuo's story a hundred times, in countless games/movies.) But Azir was new and fresh. _(not to mention Azir is voiced by the previously mentioned favourite anime character.)_\n\n{{champion:268}} {{champion:136}} {{champion:163}} Thus we find ourselves in the current day. Azir never dropped from my play, but he was recently joined by our Favourite Star Dragon, and Taliyah. I picked up both of them on release, and have enjoyed them as much (if not sometimes more so) then Azir. Sol's personality is brilliant, his voice lines tell his story as you play him, you truly feel like the creator of the universe is on your screen. Meanwhile Taliyah's connection to both Shurima and Yasuo peaked my interest, and It just so happened that like Azir and Sol before her, her play style just clicked with me, not to mention her awesome sleeves :p\n\nAnd I doubt that any of those 3 will stop being my mains ^^","replies":[]},{"poster":"OCE Yisus","date":"2017-01-20T08:13:17.463+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Maining and one tricking yi cause project yi satisfying asf.","replies":[]},{"poster":"ROGU3","date":"2017-01-20T05:32:57.138+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Some very good points, it's nice to see another player that appreciates the lore :)\nCan make certain compositions very exciting when they seem almost canon haha :P\n\nA thing I wanted to add to this though, is that imo you should never have 'one main.' Specially not when you're starting out.\n\nThe first champion I ever played was {{champion:81}} , and then I went to my friends \"So, is there anyone else like {{champion:81}} ?\"\nThey told me {{champion:110}} , and I always thought {{champion:110}}  was shit because he couldn't arcane shift :P\n\nMoving on. In my opinion you need to have at least two champions that you are confident with for each role. People that main Ahri, tend to move on to other mid laners, and won't learn top or jungle champs, which in turn makes them a weaker midlaner, because they are going to die to jungle ganks and top roams.\n\nMaining, to me, is something you do once you've learnt the game.","replies":[]}]}
