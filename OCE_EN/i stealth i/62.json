These will be to his passive, Noxian Diplomacy and Rake. To be honest, I don&#039;t think that this is going to gut him like what most people who see their main getting nerfed assume.  Meddler mentioned that they were looking in to him being more manageable for melee lanes which he is correct about. Talon abuses most melee lanes with Rake and if you get too close, he just pulls off his passive proc and kills you.\r\n\r\nSo well done, Riot, you did the right thing. You could make Talon more managable.\r\n\r\nYour thoughts?","replies":[{"poster":"Kakoda","date":"2017-02-28T00:37:30.128+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The problem with the nerf is more with the previous nerfs on the mastery tree. The small changes to that all add up. He loses a lot of dmg from these changes.\n\nIncreasing the cool down of W at lower levels is fine. But lowering dmg can really hurt him. With all the nerfs to lethality he loses sooo much dmg already.\n\nTalon is a monster early game that's true, but if you don't end the game fast his pretty much kinda usless. His good to stack black cleaver stacks for adc really that's about it.\n\nI was full build late game and couldn't combo down the adc. Late game he falls off very hard I think. So adding a derect nerf after the inderect nerfs could really hurt him.","replies":[]},{"poster":"JasonWazza","date":"2017-02-23T12:11:11.239+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yeah the changes are minor enough that they don't really matter that much to the talon player, but matter a lot to the player he is facing in lane (because now Talon shouldn't get first blood automatically when he hit's 2 like he currently can)\n\nI'm sure when this hits live it will fuck me up the first few times, but then i will get used to it and hit a few more W's before i all-in.","replies":[]}]}
