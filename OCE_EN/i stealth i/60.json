AD is more like midgame lethality triforce or hyper lategame traditional adc crit builds. Imo I'd suggest the lethality build, since it's stronger overall right now, but the lategame burst of the crit build is amazing as well with the rapid fire cannon and the 100% ad ratio on w which is magic damage, the higher atkspeed also helps him proc his e's bonus magic damage every 4 autos alot more since it has more atkspeed than traditional mage tf builds.\n\nAD tf is mainly played because of this item: {{item:3094}} , if you don't build this item on ad tf, you are kinda missing the point since the range extension on his stun becomes devastating.\n\nOnhit tf as you see there is nice, but it's not good in teamfights, it is short ranged and not very bursty (unless you get super close again) but on the plus side is good at killing tanks and is also pretty good at pushing towers.","replies":[{"poster":"FatedSaviour","date":"2017-03-02T02:02:02.080+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"your right, mine is atk speed, not ad, and also, its effective at low mobility melee champs of all kinda, i loved doing this in jg when smite buffs existed  (jg item instead of lich bane) and destiny made for awesome ganks in lane bushes","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Nightjar","date":"2017-02-24T03:44:35.487+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"about as viable as adc kennen\n\nbuild is typically either onhit based or crit based so either:\n\n{{item:3142}} {{item:3078}} {{item:3153}} {{item:3094}} {{item:3814}} {{item:3009}} \n\nor {{item:3031}} {{item:3094}} {{item:3508}} {{item:3036}} {{item:3046}}  {{item:3006}} \n\nrunes are pretty standard with for a caster type adc with 9 flat ad marks, flar ar seals, 3 flat mr glyphs, 6 scaling cdr glyphs, and 3 flat Ad quints though some people prefer to switch out 1 quint for a movespeed.. Your start is either a dorans blade or a cull, depending on how much kill potential you see in lane. Adc twisted fate has great synergy with supports like karma, zyra, lux, morgana, sona and thresh.\n\nat the moment I'd suggest the first build more since it's more early-midgame focused and is better for making roams with your ult and also is a little easier to play, the second build is more traditional and is geared more towards the extreme lategame. Imo the first build is overall more reliable.","replies":[]},{"poster":"SEKAI","date":"2017-02-24T03:40:12.402+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I tried that, met with disastrous results personally though.\n\nThough one of the players I ran into insisted that it's viable, and in their words \"play AD TF similar to how you would Corki\".
