Meddler clearly stated that Talon abuses melee matchups but instead of nerfing his melee Q, they nerfed his dash Q and they didn&#039;t even touch his Rake. The reason why Talon is abusive of melee champions is because of his melee Q crit, which deals 150% of Talon&#039;s AD. In the early game, this damage matters a lot and makes the laning phase hell for melee matchups. Also, Rake is an excellent zoning tool as well as a damage tool. Let&#039;s not forget his passive as well, which does 200% bonus bleed damage.\r\n\r\nSo my suggestions to nerf Talon are:\r\n\r\nMake his crit scale with level, as he always maxes W first. Make the scalings something like this: 130%/135%/140%/145%/150%\r\n\r\nReduce the base damage of Rake in the early levels \r\n\r\nMake the bleed damage scale with levels 1/6/11/16: 150%/165%/180%/200%\r\n\r\nThese are my thoughts on how Talon can be balanced. As far as I can tell, he is still quite a strong pick in the mid lane and occasionally the top lane","replies":[{"poster":"Lord Sesshomaru","date":"2017-06-08T00:33:52.388+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"By beef with Talon is his interaction with Yasuo.\n\nYou ult, and 12 blades spring out. **12.**\n\nIf any **one** of them nicks the windwall, **BAM** they all disappear.\n\nWhy?\n\nWhen Twisted Fate's Q hits the windwall, only the cards that hit it disappear. \nIt should be the same for Talon.\n\nAll Yasuo has to do in a fight is throw up his windwall, and Talon can't use half his kit.\nIt's pathetic.","replies":[{"poster":"Talon12","date":"2017-06-08T01:16:00.818+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"ditto braum","replies":[{"poster":"Lord Sesshomaru","date":"2017-06-08T07:35:43.091+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yea, its a weird interaction.","replies":[{"poster":"Talon12","date":"2017-06-10T04:34:12.289+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Would be great if they could run around together.\n\nhttp://imgur.com/a/IPZNx","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"I Stealth I","date":"2017-06-08T01:20:16.767+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'll be honest, in all the Talon games I've played against a Yasuo, i never noticed this interaction because all Yasuo want to make flashy plays and just windwall Rake because muh flashy plays. Yes, this makes Talon pathetic against him but you still have the guaranteed crit and Tiamat up your sleeve, not to mention your high AD. Most Talons will be useless with their Ult, taking away their dueling potential and making them more reliant on their teammates for help but thats not my point. What I'm trying to say is that Talon is still oppressive  to melee match ups (minus Yasuo) with his bleed and guaranteed crits and the recent nerfs were in the wrong direction","replies":[{"poster":"Talon12","date":"2017-06-08T07:04:03.725+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"to begin with, they nerfed his q damage not its speed or range.\n\nBut unlike renekton (easily a bigger bully) he drops off and has absolutely 0 usefulness lategame, while rene can still serve as a tank and cc bot.","replies":[]}]}]}]}
