Looking at the 520 RP deal, which gives no bonus points, we can write the equation, (520 &divide; 500c) = 1.04\r\n\r\nTherefore, 1 cent can get you 1.04 Riot Points.\r\n\r\nThis also means that mobile payment in the store is a complete rip-off and is for the desperate people who need RP.\r\n\r\nMath does help, apparently","replies":[{"poster":"JasonWazza","date":"2016-11-07T02:24:58.652+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The issue is that your argument is based on the worst RP conversion (for normal payments).\n\nAlso the mobile payments are for people on pre-paid phones, as you get to spend your recharge on buying RP.\n\nLowest of normal payments: 1.04:1\nHighest (100): 1.21:1\nMiddle Ground (35): 1.14:1\n\nMobile Payments (12): 0.56:1\n\nSo while Mobile payments are roughly half as much in worth, they can also be essentially free (prepaid phones these days come with enough deals that you don't need your recharge credit)","replies":[]}]}
