I don&#039;t know about you but this is one of the most triggering things in this game. Just because you got fed doesn&#039;t mean you&#039;re automatically going to win the game and be unkillable. If you don&#039;t maintain your lead by CSing, the enemy team is going to catch up eventually and proceed to wreck you. Granted, when I get fed, I sometimes forget to CS but now that I main GP, I see the importance of CS.\n\nTo further clarify the what I&#039;m talking about, here is an example;\n\nYour Midlaner, Lux gets fed off the enemy Yasuo . She now has a fantastic lead of 7/0/2, 29 CS at 10 minutes. Yasuo is 0/5/1, with 50 CS. 20 minutes later, Lux has 10/2/8 53 CS but Yasuo now has 212 CS, 6/5/7. He proceeds to demolish Lux and in doing so he wins the game for his team.\n\nThe thing is, just because you got fed, CSing doesn&#039;t become a chore, it&#039;s still a priority. I&#039;m pretty sure that 12 CS = 1 kill and If someone farms hard, that&#039;s as good as getting fed.","replies":[{"poster":"Nightjar","date":"2017-06-08T06:25:08.307+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I feel this is mostly correct, except if you're playing an earlygame champion or you get very far ahead as the jungler who doesn't have instant clear. In which case, you should always be looking for fights and looking for a way to force an objective. In this situation cs or minor jungle camps are a distraction and what you really need is to look for ways to begin closing out the game, gank and then force an objective like baron or tower and dragon, invade the enemy jungle, tower dive or force a teamfight over an objective and force the enemy team down.\n\nIf you're a 10-0 pantheon/shaco/khazix/ect... at 10min, and you're taking kruggs or wolves whilst any of your lanes are being pushed in and gankable, or drag/riftherald is up; you were doing something right, but now you're most likely not.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Requiemsfire","date":"2017-06-07T19:42:47.037+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yeah, I can see that, the only real exception to outline is Pantheon, your job is to get fed, push your opponent below you and then shove your spear down the other lane's throats since clearing waves isn't exactly efficient with panth and neither is pushing turrets, taking your ult and making pro-active plays with some coordination with your jungler seems the more effective since he falls off.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Requiemsfire","date":"2017-06-07T19:39:57.900+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yeah, I can see that, the only real exception to outline is Pantheon, your job is to get fed, push your opponent below you and then shove your spear down the other lane's throats.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Husy15","date":"2017-06-05T06:03:06.700+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"As someone who doesn't do this well at all, i can tell you, it's still a problem at higher Elos, however not as MUCH of a problem, and my numbers are probably a little better. but still a problem \n\n(also, the whole \"16cs=kill\" is bs, if i'm at 8 kills, with 8cs/min, and you're at 10 kills with 6cs/min, i'm still going to have more gold than you.
