A feature such as its self is always going to be used in every circumstance, and iv'e read others saying here that \"depending on the circumstance it makes a difference, and doing it on every kill is BM\".\n\nPlease give me an example when it is OK to use it than? Because as the metaphor goes when ever it is used it's like tea-bagging someone.\n\nIf anyone is actual toxic in sense it would be the other Talon cockiness and ego being crushed by yourself and that because he lost the match up that he can win by playing the victim card like so many people are doing. \n\nIf your emotional state can't handle a digital flash emote designed to mock someone that you and everyone has access to use in any circumstance than please get off the internet. \n\nYou did nothing wrong man, show that scrub talon who deserves the mastery.","replies":[]},{"poster":"JesusForgotHisGA","date":"2017-01-30T06:37:08.775+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Eh flash ur mastery emote whenever you want. If someone can't handle being shown an emote after being killed then perhaps they should go play My Little Pony. Get a grip, this is why this game is pathetic.

Getting a kill just means you got a kill, there are a wide variety of factors that would go into *how* you got that kill, and with the right circumstances anyone, regardless of skill, can get a kill.\n\n\"Emote flashing\" on every kill is basically the LoL equivalent of tea-bagging on every kill in FPS games. It's bad sportsmanship to say the least, and outright rude as far as I'm concerned.\n\nAs I said, there's no issue with you using the emote, however the circumstances you use it in can make a world of difference.\n\nFor example, if you just started a game, got to lane and \"traded\" emotes with your lane opponent, there's no issue there. Using emotes (and not just mastery emotes) at that point in the game when nothing is (usually) happening is a pretty common behaviour and, in the vast majority of circumstances, isn't seen as rude or bad sportsmanship.","replies":[{"poster":"CHEESYLEEKS","date":"2017-01-30T14:16:46.782+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Next people will be saying building {{item:3512}} in a lane your winning is BM.\n\nstop being so PC and fragile.","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Soulhavok","date":"2017-01-30T03:53:52.627+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Bad mannered = BM.
