I generally wait till a champion gets nerfed pretty hard and falls to a pretty low winrate/popularity before I pick them up again.\n\nI still sometimes play kinda of popular champs sometimes because my champion pool is small and I still haven't earnt much IP to buy champs on my account yet despite playing for almost a year and also some of the champions I own are too mechanically challenging for me to play.","replies":[{"poster":"Nightjar","date":"2017-02-08T14:27:35.248+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I also don't like how most of the champions I can play are actually sort of middle level popularity because I only just started to get the hang of them. {{item:3070}} ","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"CHEESYLEEKS","date":"2017-02-08T05:58:52.809+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"main {{champion:6}} have a mirror game once in 1200+ games and get excited asf ","replies":[{"poster":"Miicka","date":"2017-02-08T11:06:10.415+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=CHEESYLEEKS,realm=OCE,application-id=FjGAIbRv,discussion-id=nOxFqXYq,comment-id=0002,timestamp=2017-02-08T05:58:52.809+0000)\n>\n> main {{champion:6}} have a mirror game once in 1200+ games and get excited asf\n\nHonestly I don't understand why people don't play Urgot he is genuinely fun and has some great damage output.","replies":[{"poster":"Nightjar","date":"2017-02-08T14:21:57.970+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I find urgot too mechanically challenging and I'm really bad at champions like him, kayle or tryndamere.","replies":[]},{"poster":"CHEESYLEEKS","date":"2017-02-08T12:25:20.483+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"its because people watch dumbass youtubers or other forms of biased garbage. who make stupid points and never actually bother to play or even glance at his champ info page. my favorite quote being\n\n> His ult is confusing , you put yourself directly into the enemy team\n\nyeah, If your a total dumbass. because having an escape denial, scaling damage reduction,a 40% 3 second slow is totally useless in the laning phase and having a way to catch an enemy out in an ambush or through poor map awareness, locking them down then throwing them directly into your teammates is totally useless. it also has scaling range, it starts at 550 and ends at 850.\n\nyou also have the option to build tank and can be super successful with it. all you need is a sheen item + muramana and you can pretty much build full tank while still doing a ton of damage.  my fav build being {{item:3042}} {{item:3025}} {{item:3071}} {{item:3742}} {{item:3111}} with either {{item:3512}} ,{{item:3139}} or {{item:3102}}  depending on what you need. so you know have 50% damage reduc lvl 3 ult, a 400+ sheild on a really low cd, now i can pretty much ult there carry and dive head first in :p\n\nthis biggest downfall with urgot is his visuals, they are in dire need of an update, imho if you arn't using battlecast every animation feels clunky as all fuck.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"JasonWazza","date":"2017-02-08T04:23:09.257+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Honestly just hope they don't become garbage due to massive nerfs.\n\nRIP Nidalee, i still think about you all the time.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Struggle","date":"2017-02-08T03:59:57.415+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"just stomp all the fotm sheep","replies":[]}]}
