This debate cannot work for 'physical vs magical damage', because champions like Mundo, and Kog'Maw are AD champions, use AD items, and their damage scales off stats that are not AP. Yet their abilities _(Mundo Q, Kog R)_ do Magical damage.\nAlso champs like Garen are undoubtably AD champs, but have huge abilities that deal Magical damage.\n\nSo if we were to talk about 'physical vs Magical', Garen and other champions would cause issues, AD vs AP is a much clearer distinction.\n\n\n_________\n\nArmour penetration was too strong even before they nerfed it_ (everyone knows how quickly tanks melted to champions like Zed who really shouldn't have melted them)_, and with the reduction of health and the increase of armour on tanky items, armour pen would have been way too strong.\nIt was nerfed because it was too strong, not to make magic damage more powerful.\n\nAs for items like, {{item:3102}}  and {{item:3157}}  it's true that they can be put into a build without compromising it too much, _(although Zhonya's is a terrible item stat wise since they nerfed the AP, the only reason you buy it is for the active.)_ \n\nBut it's exactly the same as {{item:3814}}  and {{item:3156}}  Both of these items build very cleanly into just about any non-ADC AD champion, and provide AD champions with significant protection against AP champs, where as Banshees, only provides protection against other AP champs, it's virtually useless vs AD ones.\n\nHowever in saying that, I truly believe that giving AP to {{item:3102}} was a terrible idea, it should have remained a purely defensive item, as now every squishy mage gets a free spell shield, which is unacceptable.","replies":[{"poster":"FatedSaviour","date":"2017-05-09T03:49:37.624+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"based on the title only i thought it was gonna be what dmg do u put in ur midlane, either way my point is for ap due to harder cc and popping champs before they can react quick enough with mages like syndra anivia and viktor","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Lord Sesshomaru","date":"2017-05-08T13:45:48.096+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":2,"body":"I like this idea!\nNothing quite gets the brain juices flowing like a good old-fashioned debate. :P\n\nFor my argument, I would like to re-word the question, rather than _'best'_ I would like to argue the most _'powerful'_ type. As In my opinion _'best'_ means the thing with the least problems, even if it isn't the strongest.\n\n**In my opinion, I believe that AD is the stronger of the two damage types.**\n\n____\n**Part 1, Reliable damage**\n_____\n\n\nThere is the obvious _(but never-the-less still potent)_ statement of course that AD champions are never _truly_ without damage, as even in-between abilities they can auto attack for some level of damage, while an AP champion's damage is 100% restricted by mana and cooldowns.\n\nBut that statement alone is pointless without context, we have to consider the severity of the damage applied. For example LeBlanc's QWER abilities do significantly more damage than Kindred's, it is this way in order to account for the damage that Kindred can do without using abilities, so it could be argued that both damage types are equal becasue overall, the damage between them evens out, this means they they both are balanced despite Kindred's abilities doing less damage.  \nHowever, if the damage of both champions is balanced in terms of numbers, then Kindred _(or other AD champions)_ still have the advantage of being able to dish out damage when oom and on cooldown, and reliability is not something to be scoffed at.\n\n**For example:** An Ahri and a Zed both go ham on eachother, they both land all of their abilities, and are both left on low HP with all their abilities on cooldown. Both are Assassins, both have the purpose of killing the other as quickly as possible, but Zed will win the fight. Even though his combo does not revolve around auto attacking _(except his 1 attack to proc his passive)_, he still has the ability to dish out significant damage when his abilities are on cooldown. This is a luxury that Ahri does not have, and one that will lose her the fight in this situation. \n_(there are exceptions like Orianna of course, that use their AP for auto attacks)_\n\n_______\n**Part 2, Ability damage**\n_______\n\nThe counter to this argument of course is that Ahri's abilities do more damage than Zed's _(debatable)_, therefore It is fair that he can deal extra damage with his auto attacks.\n\nIf this is the case, and that AD champions should have abilities that are less powerful than an AP champion in order to balance the overall damage output.\nThen I would bring up champions like Darius, Jhin, Zed, Jayce, Kha'Zix, Garen, etc etc. Who all have copius amounts of AD, but whose abilities do damage that could be considered equal or even greater than many AP champions.\n\nNot to mention that _(other than a few exceptions like Azir, Sol, Cass, etc)_ AD champions have the distinct advantage when battling fighters and Tanks.\nSomeone like LeBlanc can easily assassinate a squishy, but so can Kha'Zix. However, when confronted with a tanky champion like Renekton or Sejuani, LeBlanc is rendered fairly useless, while Kha'Zix is still likely to come out with a kill, despite them both filling the same role of Assassin.\n\n_____\n**Part 3, Build options**\n_____\n\n\nAD champions also have a much larger variety of build paths, with many of their items giving them incredibly useful stats and abilities, such as: movement on hit, vision denial, both magic AND spell shields, range increase, AoE auto attacks, Multi target auto attacks, ranged cone auto attacks, increased damage vs tanky targets, not to mention the most valuable of all: **Lifesteal!**\n\n_(of course AP items have their fair share of stuff as well, Protobelt for example. However unlike many AD items that offer hordes of stats/pasives/actives on the same item, AP items are built almost exclusively for the very singular effect of that 1 particular item (meaning, you don't build protobelt for the stats, you build it because its a fricken dash).)_\n\nLifesteal is one of the greatest boons for AD champions, how many times have you died because Vayne out-healed you? or because Warwick just wouldn't f*cking die, what about when Graves and Draven get 1/4 of their HP back with every auto attack.\n\nAP champions don't get that luxury unless theres something specifically built into their kit _(or you build gunblade, which gives too many wasted stats to be useful on many AP champs)_, and theres plenty of AD champs with healing built in as well.\n\nPenetration is another key factor, there are only 3 items that give magic pen, Boots, Void Staff and Liandry's Torment.\nLiandry's is very champion specific, there are many that don't have the option of building it.\nVoid Staff is not an early game item, its not very gold efficient to rush it, and you miss out on much needed stats by building it before other key items. _(You also only get access to it's passive once it is fully completed, unlike armour pen items.)_\nWhich means that most AP champions only have Boots for magic pen for a lot for the game, and even then, some champions need Ionian boots instead.\n\nMeanwhile Serrated Dirk is cheap, worth building on most AD champions, its a great first item. and gives a decent chunk of amor pen, or lethality or armour shred _(or whatever the f*ck other confusing names you want to call it)_\nNot to mention it builds into 3 of the most useful AD items in the game _(all of which have AMAZING actives/abilities unlike Void staff, as well as other stats, that Void staff also lacks)_. And if that wasn't enough, you can then build Black Cleaver _(also incredibly useful on almost all AD champs)_ and the last whisper items as well, and all of them happen to have really great passives/stats as well.\n\nSo not only is AD damage more reliable, it also cuts through its resistances far easier, much earlier, and for much cheaper cost.\n\nAD champions also have greater early defensive items, Edge of Night and Maw of Malmortius, both of which are core on many champs, and both offer shields as well. While Zhonyas is the only AP item with defence against AD, it offers average stats, and if it wasn't for its active, it likely wouldn't be worth buying at all.\nNot to mention that its armour can easily be penetrated by the early Serrated Dirk buy, so rushing it isn't even that effective.\n\n_______\n\n**Part 4, Objectives**\n_______\n\nWhen you're a Karthus, you force Yasuo out of lane 3 or 4 times, and make full use of all that time whittling away at his tower. Then die once to him, and have him shred your tower in seconds. You'll know what I mean.\n______\n**Part 5, the champions**\n______\n\nJust as an observation:\nHow many of the classic 'universally hated' champions are AD vs AP?\n\n**AD:**\nDarius\nDraven\nLee Sin\nMaster Yi\nRengar\nShaco\nTryndamere\nVayne\nYasuo\nZed\nIrelia\nRiven\n\n**AP:**\nFizz\nKatarina\nTeemo\nMaybe Ekko?\n\nI would doubt that it is mere coincidence that the vast majority of the most hated champions are AD, not to mention the pick ratio on them is higher than the hated AP champs. And thats without including the flavour of the month hated champs like Cait and Jhin.\n\nThere is no 'point' that I'm making here, just an interesting observation. \n\n__________\n**Conclusion**\n__________\n\nThose are the main reasons why I believe that AD champions have the advantage.\nYou can say that AP champs have the burst advantage, but then Id offer you Zed, Talon, Yasuo, Vayne and a cohort of others, _(Vayne outbursts LeBlanc, not-so-fun fact)_. Sustained damage champs like Azir and Cassiopeia are great, but ADC's already do that job, and ones like Draven and Vayne do it so much better. As for tanks like Zac and Maokai, why have an AP tank, when you could play Warwick, Renekton or Nasus, who absorb the same level of flak, but can dish out so so much more damage. So in reality, there are very few roles that AP champions have that can not be filled as well if not better, by AD ones. The role one I can think of are poke mages like Xerath, Vel'Koz and Syndra. \n\n**Disclaimer:** I by no means think that all AP champions are hard-done by, or weak. Im just taking a side on this argument. To be clear, I am not defending AP champs _(some of them are absolute abominations)_, I am merely stating that AD ones have an advantage in my eyes.\n\nSo to come back to my original statement, I think that the 'best' _(most balanced)_ source of damage is AP, as it is clear where the damage is coming from, it can be dodged through skilful play most of the time, and if you miss, you are punished for it with cooldowns. But I think AD is a more 'powerful' source of damage, it has less counterplay, easier builds, and can crit.\n\nThat is my argument ^^\n\n{{sticker:slayer-pantheon-popcorn}}","replies":[]},{"poster":"Dr Cooz","date":"2017-05-08T08:53:34.581+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"AP is better Because Ap Nasus never fails","replies":[{"poster":"macktheboloz","date":"2017-05-09T00:39:42.327+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"AP for short high burst damage.\nAD for consistent damage.\n\nAP over AD if positioned well, then again you can say that about AD.\n\nI pick AP, due to the safe distance and poke.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Dark Warrior","date":"2017-05-08T12:27:35.831+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"AD>AP over all\n Ps: i am an AP fan\n\n\nAD champ can build Tanky heavy damage and MR and armor @ same time while ap ? sh!!!!!t cant do what just can stack hp and ap TBH, stack means can get more hp and get ap but not all items gives also AD have so many options for MR like {{item:3814}} {{item:3139}} {{item:3111}} {{item:3156}} and if Ap champ needs armour lets see {{item:3157}} {{item:3047}}  that's it, so well u know it already","replies":[]},{"poster":"1 11 2002","date":"2017-05-08T09:55:20.627+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"AD is significantly better if you have a full ad comp, AP struggles if you have a full ap team..\nSince AD has so many armor penetration items which provide diverse builds for every champion, AP only has about 2 which is unique too (dumb imo) A full ad team can build full armor pene vs a defensive team while AP gets f***** hard","replies":[]},{"poster":"CHEESYLEEKS","date":"2017-05-08T09:32:46.600+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hmm\n\nNeither is better persay.
