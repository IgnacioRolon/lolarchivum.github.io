I noticed that my KDA was normally fine, it was just my CS. After 10-20 games of CSing at different rates, I found the minimum CS rate you can have for an S as a jungler, is 7.0/m. It&#039;s honestly absurd that a jungler, who will rarely hit 100 cs by the 20 min mark, especially in bronze, has to keep up at this rate. Although I worked around it by clearing a lot of minion waves and invading non stop, it kind of feels unfair for the jungler to CS non stop. Why not make getting an S on a jungler more objective control based, like how many dragons/barons have you taken compared to the enemy jungler.\r\n\r\nJust a thought","replies":[{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2017-01-23T13:03:07.756+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"My best guess on this one tells me that it is because the scores are generated irrespective of level of play (to the best of my knowledge). A Bronze vsing Bronze players is just as likely to go 10/0/20 as Diamonds vsing Diamonds because they are of equal skill levels, however CS isn't linear in this respect, in the sense that as the level of play increases, the CS per minute increases quite drastically.\n\nWhat this means is that those players that aren't D+ either have to have truly exceptional scores, or really smash the CS to achieve that top % of scores.\n\nI could be entirely wrong of course, I don't actually know if they are affected by level of play or not, but that seems the most obvious reason to me.","replies":[{"poster":"Michael Stronk","date":"2017-01-24T03:37:14.123+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"actually, a bronze vs bronze is far more likely to see 10,0,20 than diamond vs diamond as deaths become more infrequent as skill increases.\n\nin saying that, this further cements your point!.","replies":[{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2017-01-24T08:18:57.437+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You have a very good point :P","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"SEKAI","date":"2017-01-23T12:26:01.542+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It isn't though. As far as I know, it just compares your whatever champ's performance with other people's performance of the same champ on the same server.\n\nIf you can't manage S even if you get a damn good score, it just means there are too many people who'd done better than you did.\n\nDue to this reason, people who play popular champs tend to run into this issues where they can't seem to get a S score no matter how hard they try and how good of a score they get. Off-beaten-path champs with significantly lower play rate tend to be easier to get S rank on.","replies":[]},{"poster":"ROGU3","date":"2017-01-23T12:13:09.276+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Another thing that's weird, is that cs definitely goes into getting an S on the aram map.
