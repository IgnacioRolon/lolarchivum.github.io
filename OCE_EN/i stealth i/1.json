YIKES!! If the tether range on that is anything more than 50 then that makes this whole kit broken on its own.\nOtherwise, it looks like he's a fairly underwhelming champion. Sure, his passive negates Darius' ult, but that shouldn't be a problem. There should be no way that a low mobility juggernaut could sneak up on or out-maneuvre a slippery assassin. I think overall, the AP ratio on his E is wasted. Assassins are meant to burst their opponents down, and build one single damage type. I can see Blinding Light as a utility spell, but its damage doesn't make sense in the rest of Stealth's kit. Also, what kind of champion is named \"Stealth\" and yet cannot use either Invisibility or Camouflage? I think to make his kit more well rounded, switch E and Q, have Critical Assault cause Stealth to enter Invisibility very briefly after attacking, and make Blinding Light deal physical damage and scale off AD. Here's how I would have worked this idea (I redid the ult and upgraded the passive, they feel more impactful now).\n\nPassive: Battle Scars\nWhen Stealth would take lethal true damage, it is ignored, and Stealth gains a shield equal to 50% of his current health. Can only occur once every 150/120/90/60 seconds (at levels 1/6/11/16)\nCooldown: 150/120/90/60 seconds (levels 1/6/11/16)\nTooltip:\n> Stealth is hardened by the battles he has fought in. When Stealth would take lethal damage from true damage, he ignores it and instead gains a shield equal to 50% of his current health. This effect can only occur once every [value=Battle_Scars_cd:ref{P_rank}] seconds.\n\nQ: Blinding Light\nStealth shines light in a moderately sized cone (60 degrees, 450 range) in the target direction, dealing 20/50/90/140/200 (at ranks 1 through 5) +(30% AD) physical damage and applying the short-sighted (what happens when you get hit by Quinn's Q) debuff to enemies for 1 second.\nRange: 450 unit radius, 60 degree arc\nPhysical Damage: 20/50/90/140/200 (ranks 1/2/3/4/5) + 30% total AD\nShort-Sighted Debuff: 1 second duration\nTooltip:\n> Stealth shines his flashlight in a moderately sized cone in the target direction, dealing [value=Blinding_Light_dmg:ref{Q_rank}] physical damage to and inflicting short-sightedness upon enemies in the cone for 1 second.\n\nW: Remote Hook\nStealth places a trap on a piece of terrain up to 750 units away. When an enemy champion walks within 50 units of the trap, they are snared for 1 second and revealed for 2.5 seconds. Stealth recharges one trap every 20/19/18/17/16 (ranks 1 through 5) seconds, but can carry 3 at any given time, and can have 10 on the map at any given time. Traps will despawn after 90 seconds.\nRecharge time: 20/19/18/17/16 (ranks 1/2/3/4/5)\nCooldown between placing traps: 0.5 seconds\nSnare duration: 1 second\nReveal duration: 2.5 seconds\nTooltip:\n> Every 0.5 seconds, Stealth can place a trap on a piece of terrain. When an enemy champion walks nearby, they are snared for 1 second and revealed for 25 seconds. Stealth can carry 3 traps at any given time, and prepares a new one every [value=Remote_Hook_rc:ref{W_rank}] seconds. Traps last for 90 seconds, or until Stealth tries to place another trap once 10 are on the map.\n\nE: Critical Assault\nPassive: Stealth gains 5/7.5/10/12.5/15% (ranks 1 through 5) Critical Strike chance.\nActive: Stealth deals 15% bonus true damage on his next three basic attacks, after each of which he enters Invisibility for 1 second, gaining 50% bonus movement speed. If any of the affected attacks are critical strikes, they deal no physical damage, and instead deal 200% true damage, after which Stealth enters Invisibility for 2 seconds, gaining 50% movement speed.\nCooldown: 18/16/14/12/10 (ranks 1/2/3/4/5) seconds\nNormal attack: +(15% AD) true damage, 1 second Invisibility, +50% Movement Speed while Invisible\nCritical Strike: (200% AD) true damage, 2 second invisibility, +50% Movement Speed while Invisible\nTooltip:\n> Passive: Stealth gains [value=Critical_Assault_%C:ref{E_rank}]% Critical Strike Chance.\n> Active: On his next three basic attacks, Stealth deals [value=0.15*AD:ref{champion_Stealth}] bonus true damage, then enters Invisibility for 1 second, gaining 50% Movement speed for the duration. If the attack critically strikes, it instead deals [value=2*AD:refchampion_Stealth}] true damage, and Stealth enters Invisibility for 2 seconds, gaining 50% Movement Speed for the duration.\n\nUltimate: Hunter Hunted\nStealth channels for 2 seconds, teleporting to target enemy champion anywhere on the map at the end of the duration. For the next 5 seconds, target champion is marked, having their damage halved, and taking double damage from Stealth. After the mark ends, or the target dies, Stealth blinks back to the original cast location. If the target champion leaves Stealth's vision during the channel, it is interrupted, and this ability is put on a 20 second cooldown.\nCooldown: 150/120/90 (rank 1/2/3) seconds, 20 seconds if interrupted.\nChannel time: 2 seconds\nMark duration: 5 seconds\nTooltip:\n> Stealth marks a visible enemy champion, and teleports to them over 2 seconds. If the champion leaves Stealth's vision, then the teleport is interrupted and this spell goes on a 20 second cooldown. Once Stealth has teleported to the target enemy champion, they are marked with the 'Hunted' debuff. 'Hunted' enemies have their damage lowered by 50%, and take 200% damage from Stealth's basic attacks, abilities, and summoner spells. If a 'Hunted' enemy is killed, or the mark times out, Stealth is instantly teleported back to the original cast location.\n\nThanks for the inspiration, I just think that in this state, the kit would feel a lot more impactful to use, and that's what Riot's philosophy is at this point in time. This rework might be a little too strong, but numbers can be toned down.","replies":[{"poster":"I Stealth I","date":"2016-11-27T10:07:32.019+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=EzeBlood,realm=OCE,application-id=hIjvqaz6,discussion-id=E7hEIATN,comment-id=0002,timestamp=2016-11-27T09:54:08.204+0000)\n>\n> A snare that lasts 2 whole seconds!?!?!
