He thinks just because he is in a higher elo, he is the MESSIAH of League, judging people&#039;s knowledge solely by their rank. As Lord Sesshomaru quoted, &quot;someone in low elo could understand the game a lot, but they might just lack the physical skill (reflexes and such) needed to climb through the ranks&quot;. To be honest, this certain poster from EUW is ruining many people&#039;s experience on the boards by thinking that his high elo rank means his opinion is right, no matter the facts. He solely believes that people who are unranked, bronze or silver have no knowledge or basic logic about the game. If a rioter or boards mod stumbles upon this, please take emmediate action.\r\n\r\nSide note: he&#039;s been banned on the NA boards as well as the EU boards, so that&#039;s saying something \r\n{{champion:91}}","replies":[]}
