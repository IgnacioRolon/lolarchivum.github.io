Now, of course the Ahri mains will defend this but this is expected. This is their main. But, Ahri has been receiving way too many skins lately. She has 7 skins once Star Guardian is released but she doesn&rsquo;t deserve it. Ahri mains will beg to differ but here are my points:\r\n\r\n1. &ldquo;She has a huge player base, and her skins will sell&rdquo;\r\n\r\nReally? This is the number one answer that Ahri mains give you if you complain about Ahri skins. Let&rsquo;s look at another champion that has just as big of a fan base as Ahri. Zed. Zed, as of currently, has a pick rate of 12% as opposed to Ahri&rsquo;s 8%. Zed came out a little under a year after Ahri but lacks skins. But, he has 4 skins right? Remember, eSport skins do not count to a champ&rsquo;s skin count and Zed has 2. So Zed, has 2 skins in the past years since he&rsquo;s been out. And he&rsquo;s more popular than Ahri. But they have a reason for this and that brings me to my next argument.\r\n\r\n2. &ldquo;She fits into the theme&rdquo;\r\n\r\nExcuse me? How the hell does she fit into the theme. I mean, if you may recall, the boards refer to Ahri mains as weebs but they keep stating Ahri is from Korean mythology, which is fine. But, the Star Guardian skin line is based on Anime, which is a Japanese subculture. So, how do you explain Ahri getting the Star Guardian skin? You&rsquo;re gonna say fox-girls are from anime but Ahri is based on Korean mythology, which isn&rsquo;t Japanese. The same could be said about Arcade Ahri. Arcade Ezreal was JRPG, Corki was Space invaders, and Ahri was&hellip;.a quick cash grab. That&rsquo;s exactly what that skin was for. And why else would Ahri be only part of 3 skin lines and the rest of her skins are solo skins, does this explain anything to you?\r\n\u000b\r\nAnd those are my arguments against Ahri&#039;s new skin.

So Pulsefire and Ace of spades themes work with him.\nBut he also has the community driven stigma of being kinda gay, so therefore skins like Star Guardian works for him too. \n\nAnd seeming Riot have a policy of _\"it doesn't matter who gets skins, as long as the skin works for them.\"_ Its a lot easier for them to make a skin for Ezreal every time than it is to make ones for champions with  much more specific themes like Yorick and Illaoi.\n\nAt least I hope thats what it is.... \nI hope theres some logic to it and it's not just blatant favouritism...","replies":[{"poster":"LevvyLeviticus","date":"2017-08-12T22:29:48.529+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'm quite annoyed that Ezreal is a guy in the girl based skin line ;-;","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Lord Sesshomaru","date":"2017-08-10T13:58:11.922+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Im just going to  start off by saying that I hate Ahri so much, of every champ in the game, she is probably the one I hate to fight most. \nShe has poke coming out her ears, but also the ability to balls-to-the-wall hard engage out of nowhere as well.\n\nI am disappointed that it's the same champions again and again that keep getting cool skins.\nBut I can see the reasoning behind this skin.\n\n_________\n\nIt will sell, she's a much liked champion, her playrate is constant, unlike other currently popular champs. So while it isn't at a high of 15%, they know it wont drop drastically to 3% suddenly. That being said, I have no idea why there isn't 20+ Zed skins already, if I was Riot id be milking the living shit out of those adolescent wallets.\n\nAnd she does fit the theme of star guardian.\nThe nine tailed fox did not originate in Japan it's true, due to Japan being a younger country than China/Korea, but it has firmly adopted the nine tailed fox and other fox spirits into both their culture and pop culture. Naruto is a clear example of this, and the Ghibli film Pom Poko shows this well too. \n\nBut in any case, it doesn't actually matter whether she is anime or not, because the whole point of a skin is to change the theme of a champ, and if you wanted to go down that road, Ahri is hella more anime than Poppy or Lulu, or Jinx, or Sona, or MF.\n\nThe theme of the Star Guardians is 'Magical Girl' whose whole thing is 'Kawaii' etc etc.\nSo Ahri (being a cute champ) fits the theme much better than other champs like Miss Fortune or Soraka, who don't embody that 'cutsie' vibe. They are rather 'mature' and 'beautiful' or even too 'sexy' in Miss Fortunes case. So its my opinion that Ahri is a better star Guardian than MF or Raka. \n\nI can see why Riot picked her for Star Guardian, and _(as they constantly remind us, almost like they are trying to convince themselves more than us)_, they don't pick skins for champs based on who recently got skins, but on wether the skin fits a certain champion.\n\n**However!**\n\nRegardless of how well a skin fits a champion, there needs to be a time when you put your foot down and say \n_\"We actually do need to make some skins for other champs now.\"_\nOtherwise Ezreal and Ahri and co. will keep getting skins, and Yorick and Swain and Illaoi and co. will keep not getting skins, forever.\n\nYorick for example has never received a new skin.\nMeanwhile Ezreal was created 7 years ago, and every single year except one since then, he has received a new skin like clockwork. _(many of which are average as)_\n\nThat shouldn't happen, it doesn't matter how well a skin fits someone, you cant just ignore champs for that long, while showering others.\nEzreal isn't even a great champ thematically, he's a blank canvas so of course every skin line In existence is going to work for him. All he is is just an average guy, you can paint him any colour you want and it wont conflict with his theme.\n\nAhri, Ezreal, Miss Fortune, and Soraka, I'm pretty sure have all received new skins for the last 3 or 4 years in a row. \nSo while Star Guardian does fit them _(although it doesn't even work with MF at all)_ champions like Yorick, Swain, Illoai etc etc should not be ignored while these champs receive yet another skin.\n\n\n________\n\nPersonally I don't buy the _\"we only make skins for champs if the theme works for that champ\"_, Simply because if after 7 years of trying, your creative team still hasn't thought up a single workable skin for Yorick.... it's time to fire them...","replies":[{"poster":"Gesteppie","date":"2017-08-11T00:52:37.673+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yorick would fit very well into gothic/ metal /rock anything dark theme XD but if you've noticed lately, Rito has only been developing \"cool\" and \"brightly coloured\" skins of late.

So giving her a skin based on the magical girl theme from anime is a good design choice. \n\nAdding to the anime theme, Kitsune in human form (which Ahri is) are basically fox versions of Nekos (anime cat girls).\n\nLet's not forget Arcade Ahri (the weebiest Ahri skin until Star Guardian). This was know as the \"weeb\" skin since it combined the anime arcade theme (I know there are arcades in the USA, but Japanese arcades are on a whole other level) with the Neko/Kitsune theme.\n\nIt's also why they made a Pop Star Ahri, because of it's connection to K/JPOP. Academy Ahri I can also sort of get because it takes themes from Japanese school girl sailor uniforms (another Japanese culture and anime trope). Challenger Ahri was something eSports related, so we can't say much about that?\n\nI guess all of her skins make sense in some way, but honestly 7 skins (8 thanks to Star Guardian) is a bit too much considering quite a few champions only have 1 or 2. Then again Annie has 10... one of which is basically a few hundred dollars.\n\nHonestly, I'm surprised she doesn't have a Maid skin yet, since that's another anime trope.\n\n**TL;DR - Ahri is basically the \"weeb\" champion, based on Japanese (and partly Chinese) culture and mythology, so her having a Star Guardian skin was about time. But 8 skins is a bit OTT when others only have 1 or 2.**","replies":[{"poster":"Lord Sesshomaru","date":"2017-08-10T10:05:39.068+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"> Ahri is basically the \"weeb\" champion\n\nYou make it sound like Yasuo isn't a thing. xD\n\nHe's like the staple swordsman character in every anime ever. \nWhere my name comes form 'Lord Sesshomaru' is one such character :P\nEven has the same shoulder armour, and a similar thing with his brother.","replies":[{"poster":"Akkordian Zoeve","date":"2017-08-10T10:14:01.592+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I didn't forget about the Japanese origin of Yasuo.

If they make skins for champions that have a low play rate like Atrox, They will only use money. The people who Design, animate, Implement, Voice act, Program dont work for free, so not only do they need to make money back on the wages, operation costs ect then turn a profit. While Riot is a game company and by all means of the imagination do a fantastic job of pleasing their patrons (Not the website the actual meaning) They are still a business, and like any business they are in the market to turn a profit. So why do champions like Ahri, Lux, annie So on so forth get skins more often? Its because its what sells, its what keeps the $$$$ rolling in and its what keeps everything both you and I love about the game afloat. By no means do I disagree with the whole ahri is over skinned.
