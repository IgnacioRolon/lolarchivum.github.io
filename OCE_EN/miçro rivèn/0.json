Please read the comment of the copy of my messages in that game below thanks. Surprising and unbelievable but really nothing toxic.\n\nSo firstly, I think we all agree with by saying &quot;report someone for toxic / trolling&quot; 2 or 3 times in a game is not abuse and it is legal as it cannot be a reason for me to get banned.\nor saying &quot;it&#039;s not her fault getting auto-filled, but it is her fault that she can&#039;t play support properly&quot;\n\nThis happened to me and it really unfair, I think. I really hope you could do something about this, not just saying how it&#039;s just wrong when it&#039;s not. Please. \nI posted this on the boards but really it didn&#039;t help, I got all negative comments from everyone when they don&#039;t even read what I&#039;m saying. So I come here simply for help to unban my account.\n\nThis is the problem, in the entire game, all I said, everything that counts as offensive was &quot;trash brand from last game&quot;. \nSo I&#039;m being completely honest here, it was a joke, and I was not being serious. \nI ended up getting permabanned from just game (message copy at the bottom, read what I write first please). 1 game a while ago lead me to a 14day-ban without the chat restriction, which one of the riot members told me that it is a special case because I was being extremely toxic, even to the enemy. I learned my lesson before that already, but this time, I really didn&#039;t say anything offensive or abusive, towards anyone on this planet.\n\nI know when you are banned, doesn&#039;t matter what other players say. Just about what you said \nBut this was what really happened, and simply, I want you to know the truth. **There are 2 screenshots linked above (from the day on oce.op.gg showing Akali was in brand&#039;s last game, but I&#039;ve never played with this brand in the previous few games)** Brand firstly said &quot;trash Akali from last game&quot; and I said &quot;trash brand from last game&quot; as a form of replying and it&#039;s pretty obvious a joke.\n\nI hope you understand what I mean by now, even if that is abusing someone, all other things I said in the only game that got me banned were not offensive and nothing in there was abusing anyone or being toxic. \nSo please help me out, simply want my account back, or give me a valid, proper reason of me getting banned, not just by saying that message above, or defending myself from other players by saying other things that are not offensive.\n\n**remember the field of justice?**\n\n[image one of my history](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1yZUuihHr2xwLjOqNPOpGxWPKMxjcLvBA/view?usp=sharing)\n\n[image two of brand history](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1lt4s0Mwr5XqOSU77ZG-WIQZb6OudKoFi/view?usp=sharing)","replies":[{"poster":"Miçro Rivèn","date":"2018-08-02T10:05:18.446+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Game 1 \nPre-Game \nMicro Riven: can i top? \nMicro Riven: plz? \nMicro Riven: 2 auto fills insane... \nMicro Riven: OMG \nMicro Riven: YASUO IS AN ADC \nMicro Riven: i dont trust anyone below plat \nMicro Riven: its soraka \nMicro Riven: bro \nMicro Riven: counter my shitt out in lane \nMicro Riven: im lv7 ashe \nMicro Riven: but i dont play fken adc? \nMicro Riven: if u guys dont carry... \nMicro Riven: what i mean is jax and yasuo \nIn-Game \nMicro Riven: trash brand from last last game \nMicro Riven: invade? \nMicro Riven: are u first time akali? \nMicro Riven: oops \nMicro Riven: wtf? \nMicro Riven: the instant ignite \nMicro Riven: ? \nMicro Riven: so akali \nMicro Riven: u went akali support and actually did nothing and flaming me? \nMicro Riven: and trying to convince me to trll riven into soraka as well? \nMicro Riven: and taking my farm? \nMicro Riven: riven adc? \nMicro Riven: wow \nMicro Riven: sej gank plz \nMicro Riven: report akali plz toxic and troll thanks \nMicro Riven: one reason i give up adc \nMicro Riven: u are attcking cs and missing it? \nMicro Riven: stop takling cs? \nMicro Riven: he got 11 out of all cs he ruined? \nMicro Riven: he missed a canon and bunch of others? \nMicro Riven: THERES BLOOD COMING OUT OF TOWER \nMicro Riven: BLOOD \nMicro Riven: DAM \nMicro Riven: attack tower? \nMicro Riven: gogogo jax \nMicro Riven: 1v2 bot is really hard tbh \nMicro Riven: what u expecting? \nMicro Riven: its not my fault getting auto filled \nMicro Riven: and i can play adc properly \nMicro Riven: its not akalis fault get auto fill sup \nMicro Riven: but its her fault trolling and cant play support \nMicro Riven: wtf \nMicro Riven: that dmg \nMicro Riven: we can win \nMicro Riven: only if akali stop trolling \nMicro Riven: he ruined my farm \nMicro Riven: thats all matters \nMicro Riven: wt \nMicro Riven: wtf man \nMicro Riven: cuz u didnt give me top? \nMicro Riven: just got 2 gold 5 with 80% wr? \nMicro Riven: are blind or what? \nMicro Riven: 80% wr past 20games for rank solo \nMicro Riven: who is the one talked first? \nMicro Riven: so is there anything wrong with talk? \nMicro Riven: he can flame when he plays relatively better? \nMicro Riven: and u as well? \nMicro Riven: we lost all lose \nMicro Riven: who cares? \nMicro Riven: ok? \nMicro Riven: just got to g5 3 days before \nMicro Riven: nice \nMicro Riven: u got more death than me? \nMicro Riven: and u have no right to conttrl what i play? \nMicro Riven: rather get hibi \nMicro Riven: 2/8 nothing better \nMicro Riven: say it to akali \nMicro Riven: stop dying? \nMicro Riven: report me nothing happened \nMicro Riven: do it \nMicro Riven: report akali plz brand \nMicro Riven: i simply got trolled \nPost-Game \nMicro Riven: report akali trolling + toxic thanks \nMicro Riven: thanks","replies":[{"poster":"Panthoen","date":"2018-08-04T07:21:40.248+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Report me nothing happened- lol","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Mondy","date":"2018-08-03T06:51:14.852+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"10/10 you deserved","replies":[]}]}
