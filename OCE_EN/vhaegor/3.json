If everyone that was master/challenger/high diamond is starting off their starting season climb from plat 1, it makes sense that all of the platinum players will need to be shunted down to make room. Same goes for gold, as the platinum players also need to start lower. And it goes on and on, until mid-low silvers are getting placed in bronze, and the majority of bronze players start from b3-5. \n\nThey don't think that players enjoy \"getting pushed in the mud and having to climb out\", the soft reset is simply a necessity to protect the competitive integrity of ranked queues. \n\nNew season changes bring about new meta shifts. The ladder reset potentially allows new faces to climb to the top tiers. Not all high elo players are going to be able to adapt their play style or 1-trickery to the new season and will find it hard to climb back up. It's a learning curve, that only the most adaptable and flexible players will find the skill and mindset to achieve \"challenger greatness\". \nLikewise, for the players that are above average but not super good the reset  means they can't become complacent in their skill. If there wasn't a reset, people in gold+ could continue to hoard rewards just by playing 1 game every x time period to maintain their rank. With the reset, only those who continuously improve and learn will be able to cash in on end of season rewards. \n\nWhile it may be annoying, just think of it as a chance to improve and show that are are a player that can consistently achieve gold. You have been gold for the past 3 season, placing in silver 2 with a 80% win rate it shouldn't take you that long to climb back. Perhaps for this season, you should aim for plat so that when season 8 reset comes you will start the climb in gold.","replies":[{"poster":"Vhaegor","date":"2016-12-16T23:31:28.405+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"But thats what placements are meant to show, if you still have your skills or not if you were complacent last season you will probably get below 50% winrate and then it would be far to drop them down. \n\nTheres no limit to how many people can get put into each rank, what you are saying is literally Riot favoring there tiny 1% minority of players in diamond plus but making it a worse time for the 90% of there player base in bronze-gold.\n\nTheres no such thing as Hoarding rewards because they are going to make those things no matter how many people have it and it doesn't cost anymore money for them to send these digital goods to 100 or a million people.","replies":[{"poster":"Ingénue","date":"2016-12-17T06:10:41.934+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"> But thats what placements are meant to show, if you still have your skills or not if you were complacent last season you will probably get below 50% winrate and then it would be far to drop them down.\n\nNot really. Placements are a very small percentage of the games you are likely to play this season. During these 10 games you could perform well, however your success may be determined by other factors such as a teammate lagging or yourself bugs platting. Likewise, you could perform like trash and your team could carry your 0/7 butt. If you are able to _consistently play_ these factors are negated as you will play enough games to make up for them and you will end up dropping or rising to a rank that you truly belong in. I think the standard number of games for this to happen is 100. \n\nThere are plenty of people that go 1-2/10 for placement games, but have intact improved enough to climb fast once that initial stressor is over. \n\n> Theres no limit to how many people can get put into each rank, what you are saying is literally Riot favoring there tiny 1% minority of players in diamond plus but making it a worse time for the 90% of there player base in bronze-gold.\n\nThere's a limit to people in challenger. like stated above, to keep the best of the best and potentially allow new challengers the reset is a necessity. \nIf bronze/silver/gold players want to be reset into a higher division, they should work really hard on improving and climbing during this season so that may become a possibility. It isn't easy, but it works. \n\n> Theres no such thing as Hoarding rewards because they are going to make those things no matter how many people have it and it doesn't cost anymore money for them to send these digital goods to 100 or a million people.\n\nA little bit ambiguous on my part here, but by \"hoarding\" I meant its usually the same players every season that are getting the rewards. The reset allows for the meta shifts, and players move and and down based on that. Possibly allowing \"new\" players to become above average and get a chance at being victorious.","replies":[{"poster":"Vhaegor","date":"2016-12-17T09:11:42.095+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"So because theres a small chance of some players to be put higher because of luck they just make everyone go lower even if they go 10/10 in placements? that is a terrible way to do it.\n\nYea there are 200 players in challenger and sure they need to drop down, but do you seriously think they need to shove MILLIONS down just because of those top 200 players? again a terrible way to do it.\n\nbut someone else getting gold+ and getting the rewards doesn't in any way at all stop any other player from getting gold+ aswell. Placements is literally the reason why there are so many bronze and silver players. Because someone has to lose for someone to win but by riot going in every single season and pushing the whole ladder down the percentage of bronze and silver players will increase.\n\nPlacements done like this are literally making more people fall in bronze each season. maybe it seems crazy but ill explain.
