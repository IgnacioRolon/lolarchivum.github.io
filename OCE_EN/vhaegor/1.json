Yea they might be cool but you could always just change it so that the more damage you dealt with attacks the bigger the number gets and when its high enough you get the red explosion look (does anyone actually care about the big numbers?). So theres one upside that could be easily solved but plenty of downsides, like winning/losing from RNG (I know its stacked by riot to work better but its still not perfect) and the annoying moment where you crit a minion just not killing it as it dies to minions (I know its happened to everyone thats played ADC enough).\n\nMaybe they just can&#039;t be bothered changing it and coding in the new stuff but if that is the reason its kinda sad. Even arguments like it would ruin Yasuo, Ashe or gangplank, it wouldn&#039;t because there passives/ability could just work off the new % damage increase the same way. For infinity edge it could just increase that % by an extra 50%, so 10% becomes 15% etc. It would give the exact same DPS just without the RNG aspect involved.\n\nWhat does everyone think? do you think its worth changing or do you just not give a single shit? ive never liked crit in any game from Pokemon to Fire emblem. Throw me any rebuttals you can think of, im sure I can counter argue them. Would be really awesome if a Riot developer answered if they were working on crits or have just given up on them.","replies":[{"poster":"Klavinmour","date":"2016-10-13T10:16:43.897+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Crits are a video game standard.\n\nI personally wouldn't mind seeing Red Crits added to LoL.\nA crit that goes beyond that of a normal crit is amazing.\n\nThe randomness of critical hits in games is why they exist.\nRemoval of them in games that are used to having them, or changing their mechanics ends up making them feel weird.\n\nTake a look at Fallout 4.\nThe system in which crits exist is okay, but it doesn't suit the flavour of what a critical hit is.","replies":[{"poster":"Vhaegor","date":"2016-10-13T12:26:53.042+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Since when have crits been a video game standard, they are only really ever in RPG games and even then are become much rarer these days.\n\nThey have Infinity edge or do you mean they should add a 1% chance for every character to randomly deal 1000% damage or something? Ive never heard the term Red Crits before. Ive never ever played a game were I have though, damn this games needs crits added. The only time I ever even think about crits is when I play perfectly in something like Fire emblem or Pokemon and die to a crit.\n\nIn Fallout 4 Vats is there if you want the percentage chance to hit and crit, but idk why anyone would want to play like that besides just being bored with nothing else left to do.\n\nmaybe ive played enough games were crits are nothing special at all so all I see are the outcomes which are I win because of a crit and feel cheated or I lose because of a crit and also feel cheated.\n\nIm honestly curious, do you find battle systems with percentage chances to hit and crit better than ones that you have to aim and stuff? seems masochistic to like them more to me.","replies":[{"poster":"Klavinmour","date":"2016-10-14T03:31:38.981+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"There is no percentage chance for a crit to hit in Fallout 4 unless if you use the drug Overdrive which gives a 25% crit chance.\nIn FO4 crits are a built up meter that only is used when you decide to use it.

The ideas behind this side of gaming is that no matter how weighted the odds, there is always the tension that it's never quite over until you see either victory or defeat. It's a very casual side of gaming, and it take a chill type of person to accept it. For those that don't take the game to seriously or those that do take it seriously but still enjoy the game; the tension created by crit chance and the turn arounds or how you can lose despite your best efforts, stop the game from becoming a monotonous grind. This is especially true in games like pokemon where outside of extremely high ladder matchups, you generally can't lose if you understand the game and your opponents intention.\n\nRed Crits exist in a few games, usually as easter eggs and are usually base secret crit chances that can affect all aa and ability damage, as oppossed to crit chance you can increase with items. Personally I think League should definitely NOT have Red Crits be a thing because it's not something you can itemise for or against and takes that 'bit of extra damage' into something that can feel unfair when champions like lategame caitlynn will already hit you for 2k physical damage if you step on her trap and she crits with her full (80-100%) crit build... I don't want this number getting an additional damage modifier on top. \n\nCrits are best when you can kinda see that a champion has a fair chance of critting you for a bit of extra damage, and makes it less predetermined who would win a 1v1, rather than, even though they have no crit chance, any champion could suddenly pull 500% more damage out their ass if I'm just very unlucky. I feel League of Legends is a little too much of a serious game to have anything like red crits. On the matter of crits I'm mostly indifferent but I feel they still have a place in the casual side of this game. At least for now.","replies":[{"poster":"xDarkRavenx","date":"2016-10-14T08:05:13.489+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Red crits in Warframe. :^)","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"dragon poo","date":"2016-10-13T05:57:52.776+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"Crit as a mechanic is unhealthy for a competitive game, due to the random aspect if it. similar to the drakes being random, one stray crit can turn the tide of a fight just as much as that single fire drake within the 3 winds ones.","replies":[{"poster":"Nightjar","date":"2016-10-13T06:17:53.447+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"however if you remove rng completely, next thing to address is differences between champion numbers and following that item efficiencies and it goes on. As soon as you pull at a thread, the whole thing unravels and that'd be too much work to deal with. Also crits is kinda bread and butter videogame stuff and playing the game without crit would be kind of weird at this point.","replies":[{"poster":"Vhaegor","date":"2016-10-13T12:17:31.994+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Crits are pretty much only in rpg games and even then not in all. Crits were a way to add some flavour to single player games without needing actual coding and has become a very outdated system. In most games crits have been replaced with hitting a specific location for extra damage which makes infinitely more sense but that wouldn't work in League. Especially now in competitive games there is just no need for rng unless you don't actually want it to be serious like Hearthstone.\n\nThe only thing wrong with crit is the early to midgame items giving crit, crit runes and Tryndameres passive which I think stops him being buffed to be a more playable character which sucks because hes pretty cool. Things like Jhins 4th shot and Yasuo/ADCs with 100% crit chance are fine because at that point it is just an autoattack % buff. \n\nThere is a complete difference between between Crit chance and the balance of champions, they already buff and nerf champions constantly so its not gonna change a thing at all. I have to disagree completely and say ive never played a game and though, oh damn I wish this game had crits in it.","replies":[{"poster":"Nightjar","date":"2016-10-13T22:41:16.643+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hmm true; though I feel that pulling crit out of the game would still create too many balance issues since the game has been using it for so long, and certain champions rely heavily on atkspd-crit builds as oppossed to stacking ad-armour pen builds or simply artifical crit modifiers in their kits. I'm also sure alot of the casual community would miss crits, just as much as some of the hardcore community would relish their removal. Also there are a handfull of games where I missed crit but yeah they were all in the rpg genre so fair point.\nBasically I feel removing crits would change up the game alot, and so it'd be quite difficult to remove it from the game.\n\nIt also creates a balance tension between ad casters and aa-based adcs. Since casters don't benefit as much out of crits as their aa based rivals do and are more armour pen and stacking ad focused. I already feel that aa-based adcs are a bit underwhelming in terms of the meta compared to caster types, especially with the higher importance of positioning and the finer details of autoattacking required to maximise damage output. With the removal of crit, a number of crit based adcs would have their entire identity and gameplay gutted and atk-speed crit items always offer an alternative to the other 2 main build types, atkspd onhit and AD armour pen. I'm not sure riot can address this imbalance issue without reworking pretty much every adc and ad based champion if they were to change crit; and that sounds like alot of work.\n\nPersonally I don't mind the rng elements of the game (though dragons is too much rng for my liking) but I can understand why people want to remove it. Trust me I've been there when that 1% crit rune darius gets 5 crits on his first 5aas and wins lane. I just pose that there might be alot more balance issues and things to consider, when deciding to phase it out (I feel that eventually they will remove crit but that may take some time).","replies":[{"poster":"Vhaegor","date":"2016-10-17T09:52:04.900+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You must of not read or understood my post. Replacing crit with % autoattack damage increase would be the exact same, just with no rng around it. For champions that work off crit you just make them work off this new stat, you could even call it crit still and keep the red numbers every time you attack once you get some.\n\n I agree that the random Dragon aspect was just weird but its still down to who gets the Dragon, some teams might be better with a certain Dragon but they still need to outplay the other team so its fine.\n\nI just don't see how you can get enjoyment out of winning from something that isn't even you doing it, its just a computer. Losing from crit is terrible and winning from crit takes away from the victory imo.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"fattyhotdogs","date":"2016-10-14T00:03:22.552+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Because corki with 1.5 atk speed should not have the same dps increase from crit chance as tristana with 2.5 atk speed.
