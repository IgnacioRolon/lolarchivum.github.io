Is there? I can&#039;t think of anything myself besides like knowing most of the enemy team somehow. Seems like a very tiny tiny percentage though compared to the upsides.\n\nWhat does everyone else think? don&#039;t think it would be that hard to add in since it would be pretty much the same as surrender and seems like there would only be positives.\n\nEDIT: new Idea. \n\nOk firstly if you were confused this is an ADD ON to the already current remake system of having a DC at the start.\n\nNow what if it was like this instead? The team remaking (lets say Blue side) has to first vote as group with majority (or all players which ever Riot feels necessary) to get the remake happening and a certain amount of time like 10-20 mins or something has to of passed. Then it is handed over to the enemy team (red side) where they now vote majority (or all players) for the remake to happen. Everyone on the blue side apart from disconnected players (They will get the same penalty as all disconnects) get no LP/MMR lost but everyone on the red side gets LP as if they had won the game. You can't really abuse this system yourself you have to rely on the enemy team. To stop the abuse pretty much completely you would make it only be able to happen when there is a disconnect on one of the teams like the system they have now.\n\nThis would actually get the enemy team to vote for it because they will be getting there LP, so how about this system?","replies":[{"poster":"Maximum Spice","date":"2016-11-03T10:01:34.492+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Did you even think this through?

Of course most people won't vote because they just want there free win but its still better than no remake after 3 mins right?","replies":[{"poster":"Maximum Spice","date":"2016-11-06T11:10:22.248+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I get your point but WHO would EVER use it. Its a pointless feature. it would be better to allow remake if a player joins then dc's still being before 3 minutes OR connects but lags out BEFORE 3 minutes also and still allowing it.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Vhaegor","date":"2016-11-05T00:08:46.275+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Ok firstly if you were confused this is an ADD ON to the already current remake system of having a DC at the start.
