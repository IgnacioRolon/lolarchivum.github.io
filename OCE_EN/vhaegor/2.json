Anyway I then did my placements, played as best as I could and went 8-2 in the end. Ending up getting Silver 2 which honestly for me just sucks and makes me not want to play. People keep saying the climb is the fun part of league but fuck that, after I get to gold yea its nice to climb but silver is such a slog. Being in Gold I don&#039;t feel pressured to play because I know I will get the skin at the end (even though last seasons was barely worth it, Maokais skin sucked but atleast I got Maokai free and hes fun).\n\nAnyone else wish Riot would like ask you if you want to go down divisions at the end of a season? because I don&#039;t think going 8-2 should ever make you go down 3 whole divisions. I understand Challenger and Master players getting shoved down but why do you have to do that to Gold and below players that just want to actually climb without having to play this game multiple times every day?\n\nRiot just, this is not a fun way to start a new season it just really isn&#039;t.

Very often, you see players that get a certain rank (lets say diamond) in one season, then the next they struggle to get out of mid-plat. It isn't because they are boosted, but more because they couldn't adapt to the change. Maybe their 1-trick got nerfed (I had a friend that was chall and is now stuck in high plat because fiora changed and he is still learning another role), or they couldn't adapt to new changes, or even because they got tilted off the fact they deserve better. Likewise, you have players that have remained open to new ideas, kept their champion pool flexible and kept up with at least 2 roles (+support), who seem to shoot up while the rest are still struggling to cope. \n\nIt isn't fun, I agree. I hate gold. It's hard because you have all these people that just got out of silver and think they are the best ever (when in reality they are still potato). They still make stupid mistakes, then blame others and spend the rest of the game typing questions marks into chat while they fall even further behind. \n\nIn the end, I know that I can play well at a mid-high plat level and that I don't want to stay in gold for much longer than I need to. I know that I have ways to challenge myself and have fun while I climb back to where I want to be. I can play a new role, I can flex it up with my friends, I can analyse my stats and track my improvements on the way (I have a weak spot for numbers). \n\nYou just have to suck it up (because if you keep playing, you will be reset again for s8), and learn what makes the climb back up fun for you.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Slowdownn","date":"2016-11-17T23:21:41.189+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Rito is doing that because they know lots of us have peaked at our tiers and we may start to lose interest in playing ranked if we stay there too long.
