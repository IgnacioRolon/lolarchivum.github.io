But then I just get demoted instantly out of the blue with zero warning, it&#039;s really annoying to know you can just be demoted like a flash but actually climbing takes weeks.\r\n\r\nIs this normal? because if it is Riot need to get off there ass and fix the ranked system.","replies":[{"poster":"VeroGas101","date":"2015-10-21T09:16:21.537+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"No need to be crude or rude my friend, \n> [{quoted}](name=Vhaegor,realm=OCE,application-id=ElA0rvVL,discussion-id=fEGbsdnJ,comment-id=,timestamp=2015-10-19T02:01:43.790+0000)\nBut then I just get demoted instantly out of the blue with zero warning,\n\nAs u can see above, you stated that you got banned without a warning, which is why i'd like to introduce you to the \"0 LP EXTRAVAGANZA\" which is pretty much the state in which an account has 0 LP. Now i'd like to inform you, that as soon as your account hits 0LP you have an immediate chance of being banned on the spot (upon hitting 0 LP) or after losing a game ( or more ) after that.","replies":[]}]}
