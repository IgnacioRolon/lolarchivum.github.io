At first i closed and re opened the client a few times followed by completely deleting league and re-installing it but it keeps on happening and i don&#039;t know how to fix it. Plus i know its not our ip as a problem because my brother can play it on his laptop with no problems. If anyone has any idea of how to fix this it&#039;ll be much appreciated.","replies":[{"poster":"quinn or feed","date":"2015-10-07T06:40:13.799+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hi,\n\nThis is happening to me too. Only about one in ten or so games, but it's still consistent and quite annoying. I'm worried I'll get a ban if it keeps up :/\n\nAll of my other games work fine, load very fast. I'm using a brand new Windows laptop, with all of the firewalls set to allow all LoL communications/programs, etc.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Mindstar","date":"2015-10-06T23:47:12.593+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hi Zaxyn\n\nDoes this happen all the time or just sometimes?  Given that it works for your brother (does he use the same internet connection?), it might be something related to your laptop specifically.\n\nAs a first step, you could try the [troubleshooting connection issues](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues) article on the Riot Support site.\n\nCheers\nMindstar","replies":[]}]}
