Recently I hovered over Lulu and saw that I had the classic skin on which I found odd. I went  to see if I still had the skin and it said that I didn&#039;t own it. I&#039;m really confused because I definitely played with the skin and a different friend says he remembers me playing Lulu mid with it. I have two reasons why this might have occurred but I&#039;m not sure.\r\n\r\n1. My friend is now banned\r\n2. I changed my name\r\n\r\nI don&#039;t know if these happening should actually affect a gift that I was given like six+ months ago but not really sure.","replies":[{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2016-06-14T08:48:10.572+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You'll have to [submit a support ticket](http://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/requests/new) for that one, we can't help you here unfortunately.
