Would expect non the less from myself to be toxic even after the 14 - day warning. Moving forward from it considering it has been over 2 years now i believe that as a person i have changed. In terms of what happened on that day and how i got banned i do admit the best way looking back at it now would have been to just /mute all and just accepted it. However i would like to appeal for an unban on my account as i do think that over the course of two years i have developed to become a much better person. In terms of how i see and do things and the things that i say have a significance in relation to other players in the game. I would be considered as a \"reformed\" player in my opinion. \n\nI do feel quite embarrassed to post it publicly as the things said i find quite horrible and is no way acceptable to say under any circumstances. I do apologies for what you read.\n\nGame 1\nIn-Game\nChoopi: smite jg?\nChoopi: bit late bro\nChoopi: both of you are shit stfu\nChoopi: nice hin\nChoopi: can u fuck off?\nChoopi: bronze 5 hard stuck trash bag\nChoopi: makes sens\nChoopi: mnad?\nChoopi: mad?\nChoopi: so close\nChoopi: xD\nChoopi: i feel bad for you bro\nChoopi: having to deal with a toxic/bad sup ;P\nChoopi: Ggwp report sona thanks :D\nChoopi: full int mode engaged\nChoopi: why do you play if you troll?\nChoopi: or maybe you dont play and your bad\nChoopi: same thing right\nChoopi: love how people play norms just to troll becuase bots are to hard for them unlucky xD\nChoopi: AHHAA\nChoopi: 2v5?\nChoopi: NICe\nChoopi: fuck up sona\nChoopi: 10 ping still play like shit\nChoopi: what a waste\nChoopi: waste of time\nChoopi: cusss\nChoopi: why\nChoopi: just vote yes jihn\nChoopi: waste\nChoopi: of\nChoopi: time\nChoopi: wait do you do damage?\nChoopi: hahaha\nChoopi: wp\nChoopi: can u guys end\nChoopi: we wasting time 20 ban que and these guys think we can win :(((((\nChoopi: plox end\nChoopi: *red\nChoopi: how did u die again jhin?\nChoopi: lol\nChoopi: please\nChoopi: please\nChoopi: why\nChoopi: asfihwdsfgasor hg\nChoopi: lucian whyyy\nChoopi: gg\nChoopi: imma go make food\nChoopi: im mmaking food you idiot\nChoopi: yeah report jayce afk\nChoopi: im afk\nChoopi: im afk\nChoopi: i can\nChoopi: but i dont want to\nChoopi: i want the game to end\nChoopi: its  a waste\nChoopi: like sona said its \"Just a norm\"\nChoopi: so why we trying to harD?\nChoopi: oh im beyound that point i honest dont care anymore\nChoopi: good bye my lover\nChoopi: ggwp\nChoopi: you have already fed\nChoopi: ll\nChoopi: Gwp\nChoopi: ez\n","replies":[{"poster":"Project Xayah","date":"2019-07-11T04:28:02.954+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"It's always good to see someone who's making effort to improve their behaviour, it really does work out better for everyone when people do that. Keep up the good work, man.\n\nSo far as the possibility of being unbanned, Riot's policies are pretty much \"only if it's a false positive\". Depending on the specific circumstances of the case, you *might* be able to get the ban removed, but the chances of that are very small (I believe the false positive rate is well below 1%) and ultimately up to the discretion of Riot. You can feel free to submit an appeal to [Support](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/requests/new) (use the \"Discuss a personal suspension or restriction\" option), but it's important to keep in mind that it statistically wont get the result you want.\n\nRiot has done some experiments attempting to reward \"reformed\" players, by giving them the opportunity to earn back their perma-banned accounts in proving they've reformed, however those experiments tend to have a 1% success rate, with the vast majority (99%) of \"reformed\" players simply going back to their old behaviours after getting their account back. Ultimately, the damage it causes is just too great for such a small benefit.\n\nYou can still play on a new/alternate account, but generally \"permanent\" ban means \"permanent\".","replies":[{"poster":"Choopi","date":"2019-07-12T13:58:00.520+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thank you for the comment.
