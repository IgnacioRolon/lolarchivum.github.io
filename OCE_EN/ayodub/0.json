I was smurfing so I knew how to deal with the situation and we ended up winning.\r\n\r\n It was really strange because they kept blowing their ghost summoner spells randomly. None of them spoke in all chat because I would think at least one would complain about their team (as pretty much all of them were feeding).\r\nIt was just very unnatural game play as though they were bots and I&#039;m wondering if there is some sort of hack people do to grind their low level accounts. \r\n\r\nOne of my team members in the lobby said they&#039;ve seen it done before; \r\n\r\n&quot;jacklovesmint: so i have faced that before\r\nAyoDub: lol\r\nyoanlovesmint: same\r\njacklovesmint: and they never appear in the lobby after&quot;\r\n\r\nand they did not seem to appear in the lobby at all. I sent the enemy team all a friend request but none of them have accepted.\r\n\r\nIt&#039;s not a major problem, I&#039;m just curious about the whole scenario.","replies":[{"poster":"Wuks","date":"2016-02-17T00:03:02.942+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yup, it's likely that these players are botting their accounts.

It's very orderly, none of them pings, they all don't chase and when they all reach to the mid turret, they all press ghost.\nThey are constantly blowing their summoner spells randomly.\n\nRiot did you program bots to come up in low level normal games randomly so that low levels can learn from their games?\nIf I figure out how to record this, I will send it to you but I have the names of all the players.","replies":[]}]}
