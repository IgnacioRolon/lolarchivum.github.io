Is there any reason to this? does it base it off KDR of recent games?","replies":[{"poster":"Tele","date":"2015-07-03T08:01:22.646+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Your elo is lower than the average for your division, so the system thinks you don't belong there, and is just trying to speed up the process of you dropping to division under you. But if you win heaps, your elo get higher and ranked system will be like \"oh jk this man is a beast, he deserves the next division\" and you'll start earning more than 20 lp for each win.","replies":[{"poster":"Ediwir","date":"2015-07-03T09:09:03.800+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It's a short form, but yeah, it works pretty much like this.\nLPs are just esthetics, what counts is the MMR- and at the moment, it seems like it's not a platinum MMR.

Personally Im like +20 in my W/L difference too, but I'm only gaining 18-22 points a game. However I'm only losing like 12 for a loss so im happy with it.\n\nYou will notice big difference in LP gain when your record for your last 20 games is 9-11 when compared to being 16-4.\n\nWin streaks help a lot and losing streak hurt a lot when trying to climb.","replies":[]}]}
