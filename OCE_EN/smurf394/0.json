It's important to note that differences in champions used, target preferences and builds/build paths (as well as other factors) would have a significant effect on overall damage dealt in the duration of a game. For example, a champion with high AP scaling, who prioritises squishy champions (\"Carries\") and includes some Magic Penetration is likely to deal more overall damage than a champion who has low/medium AP scaling, who prioritises tanky/off-tank champions and no Magic Penetration.","replies":[{"poster":"Nightjar","date":"2016-10-20T23:58:51.639+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You also have to consider how they use the damage and also how hard they were trading in lane. I've had games where pokey mage supports such as soraka, sona, annie, morgana, karma, zyra (especially zyra) and zilean have just outright put out more damage than the entire team despite only having 1 or 2 or even no damage items. I played a normal with a platinum friend a few weeks ago and he went zyra sup and he did about 20k more damage than the top, jg, mid and adc combined by the end of the game, despite the fact that the midlaner had more ap and gold to work with.","replies":[]}]}]}
