It is really common for junglers to ignore their team to get sated. If you notice that you have a devourer jungler on your team, you should be doing your part to play safely so they don't need to babysit your lane and so that the game doesn't progress too fast. If you really need the help, be sure to ping them and super sweetly ask for a gank (I feel that you maybe weren't so nice in doing this). \n\nLastly, if you want to avoid players like this in the future, [I would suggest joining a premade team](http://boards.oce.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/team-recruitment). You build relationships, can learn to fit with each others play styles, have A+ communication and avoid toxins like feeders/afks/general potatoes. With all of the incentives being thrown at you (increased IP, mastery points and hextech stuff) there is literally nothing to lose ♥\n\nNote: Riot is unlikely to do anything to this player just because he wanted to farm till sated.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Bambooze","date":"2016-03-28T11:10:01.319+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Remove the guys name.\n\nNaming and Shaming not allowed\n\n","replies":[]}]}
