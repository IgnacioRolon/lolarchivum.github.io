I&#039;ve been trying to buy a bunch of T2 runes, but everytime I press on the Gameplay tab in the in-game shop, all that happens is that the whole shop turns into a black page. This only happens for the Gameplay tab, while all of the others work perfectly. I have updated my Internet Explorer, reset its settings, and restarted the League client. I also tried a different account and the same thing happens. Any help would be appreciated.
