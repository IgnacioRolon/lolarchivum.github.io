I have probably spent 30+ hours going through every thread looking for a solution yet i haven't found one to work for me,  these are all of the following things i have done to try fix the issue\r\n\r\n- Uninstall/Reinstall\r\n- change net adapter settings around to the 8.8.8.8 - 8.8.4.4\r\n- install the latest graphics driver\r\n- install the latest updates on windows updates\r\n- going into the rads folder and deleting certain files then restarting the comp\r\n- deleting launcher, patcher specifically.\r\n- turning Num lock on/off/holding it down while i click the client \r\n- downloading a rads_user kernal from another source\r\n- turning of all my firewalls, avg, avast etc\r\n- using ccleaner to clear out my registry and\r\n- uninstalling adobe air and specifically putting in my league folder where i then install it there\r\n- changing around resolution settings (im talking every single possible option there.....)\r\n- downloading LOL client from another region,\r\n- and the obvious run as administrator.\r\n\r\nI'm sure that there might be even more things i have tried but the point is i have tried so damn hard, i enjoy playing the game and have spent good money on it as well, i don't have another way to play besides my computer, to say im disappointed with riot and there lack of help would be an understatement, i have never had such an issue with any other game ever, im not posting this to be an asshole towards riot gaming but more so to ask for one last show of help before i'm basically forced into quitting a game","replies":[{"poster":"HORSE OF FORCE","date":"2015-03-26T11:04:18.773+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You've made a support ticket, yes? This seems like something you'd need the RADS logs for.\n\nHave you tried running it in compatibility mode? Like, good ones to try are 7 and XP.","replies":[]}]}
