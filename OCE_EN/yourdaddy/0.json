I&#039;ve had this problem for a while now, but I am eager to reconnect as soon as possible. But now I do not see the point when I am going to get placed into a lower priority que anyway, now lasting 20 minutes for 5 games.\n\nThis is, in my opinion, stupid. I have clearly reconnected back, and have tried making a positive contribution. Even when winning a game with my team after having to shut down my computer I still got the message of the 10 minute low priority que. My question is why do I have to get punished because my computer has its moments here and there, when I have RECONNECTED, and what you will do to fix this. Your message explains that in some way I was &quot;afk,&quot; when in fact I was never away from my keyboard, but staring at a black screen, rushing to connect back so I dont fall too far behind. I guess this gives me incentive to not even turn my computer back on again.","replies":[{"poster":"Glow","date":"2016-10-09T21:18:35.276+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The Leaverbuster system doesn't just look for players who fully leave the game and never come back, it also targets people who AFK. Sometimes someone will get salty and AFK for 5 minutes but then come back. However, this is still very disruptive for the other players in the game! Although your intentions and an AFKers more malicious intentions are very different, to the system (and indeed your four teammates left battling outnumbered) they appear the same. Regardless of whether or not you won the game, an unfair element that your teammates had no control over was still added into the game, creating a more negative experience.\n\nYou said that you've had your computer unpredictably shutting down for a while now, so I'm guessing you've left and reconnected to other games. This would be what triggered the system to put you in a low priority queue. I understand that computers will often have mysterious problems, but if it's affecting you enough to trigger a punishment then you should look into getting it fixed.","replies":[]}]}
