I am really getting sick and tired of supporting all the time as it is a roll I do not main in ranked gameplay.\r\nSomething needs to be done to either get rid of the roll because it is just plane boring or get a better distribution of who has to put up with it.","replies":[{"poster":"Roguestoney","date":"2016-08-31T23:11:11.709+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Please be a troll post.","replies":[]},{"poster":"CHEESYLEEKS","date":"2016-08-31T23:08:26.514+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Support is an integral roll in any team comp.

Also in norms people follow the meta because that's what the big boys do. No one said you have to follow the meta, if you decide to roam and dont feed, dont steal CS, dont ks, and your ADC is doing well without you, and help win the game then im sure no one will have a problem with you neglecting the support lane... but the meta is a thing because i doubt this would even work.\n\nAlso my lappy pauses for a second before entering the lobby, which usually puts me as entering the room last. Sometimes even after all the rolls have been called so i dont see whats left. Ironic, given my name sake, but causes the urge to sigh when I occasionally do want to try pick a lane.\nI put this down to my shitty laptop though, it doesnt happen when i play on a decent desktop etc","replies":[{"poster":"Nightjar","date":"2016-09-01T00:09:32.612+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"if you want a support that works extremely well in normals go mundo support. You are the tankiest pokiest annoying support. Sure you don't have cc  and it's bad in proper games but in normals and low elo you have soo much damage since mundo get's all his damage from base numbers, so just buy regular tank support items and just run at the enemy adc and watch them panic. Mundo support does just about as much damage as toplane mundo though you're squishier so you can often just win botlane through your high damage and dueling potential. In early levels your poke is stronger than any other support and you sustain so much since you can just blindly spam q's since you don't have mana.","replies":[{"poster":"Sloth Almighty","date":"2016-09-01T01:17:14.633+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Interesting. I've gone fiddle support a lot, and we works pretty good for high early damage poke. I might even give this Mundo thing a shot sounds fun","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Sneed","date":"2016-08-31T23:21:16.800+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"supports are worthless anyway, just play a carry like ad lissandra instead","replies":[]}]}
