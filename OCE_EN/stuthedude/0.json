He was a traveller, but not like any others. Many adored his triumphant journeys yet no one knew the man he truly was.\n\nEzreal&rsquo;s heart glowed with a certain magical aura that many of Valoran&rsquo;s renowned sorcerers could not comprehend. His talents let him soar to new heights during every exploration he set out on. Townsfolk called him a prodigy however he thought of himself as a humble survivalist.\n\n~\n\nNight fell within the Shuriman desert as Ezreal pulled a flask from his satchel. He had travelled far from Piltover, over the Ironspike Mountains and through the raging cold war of Demacia and Noxus to finally reach the sands. His expedition was a lonesome one, with only him and his mind left to console his worries. \n\nThe words of his teacher echoed, &ldquo;Shurima is an incredible place, one minute you&rsquo;re scaling the highest dune and the next you&rsquo;re being torn asunder by the god-forsaken heat.&rdquo;\n\nAlthough the heat didn&rsquo;t affect Ezreal during the day, the cold seemed to when night broke. Without food to eat or even a bed to sleep on, Ezreal&rsquo;s legs crumbled as he was cast onto his very knees.\n\nThe flask was empty. No drop of water for miles. An explorer&rsquo;s worst nightmare.\n\nHis hands gripped the sand but it just ran through his pale fingers. His eyes started to water as he beat the ground. The reflection in the flask showed a dirty face and a broken down spirit.\n\nThe teacher continued in his head, &quot;You, my dear boy, are going to do this one last expedition for me before we part ways.&rdquo;\n\nEzreal summoned the last amount of strength he had to stand up. His arms had blisters throughout and his legs weren&rsquo;t much better. His feet weeped as they kept trudging through the sands.\n\nUsually he would be up for this kind of task, a Shuriman artefact was no big deal for a master explorer like himself but he lacked the knowledge of what exactly he was searching for.\n\n&ldquo;All I know is it&rsquo;s somewhere in that desert and you&rsquo;re the best of the best, just find it for me.&rdquo; The professor urged. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re my only hope now Ezreal.&rdquo;\nHis last words to the explorer drove Ezreal mad with guilt. If he did not complete the quest, then he truly wasn&rsquo;t the best explorer in Runeterra. \nEzreal reached for his satchel while continuing through the cold, dark desert. His frustration grew to its peak when the realisation of not carrying a map came to be.\n\n&ldquo;Of course, my luck&rsquo;s run out.&rdquo; Ezreal exclaimed to himself, &ldquo;Who doesn&rsquo;t bring a map to this kind of place?&rdquo;\n\nHis words were drowned out however by the sight of a tree that came into his vision. Celebrations continued as he picked up the pace to find a row of palms. The palms seemed to arch over a certain path that started to form out of sandstone bricks. Ezreal&rsquo;s tracks ceased to form around the sand as he leapt onto the bricks and ran along the path.\n\nA full moon showed nothing in front of Ezreal as he sprinted further into the night. Pulse was rising. Fear was subsiding. His thirst and hunger ceased to be as he found a dome of sandstone. The rocks seemed perfectly sculpted by a master craftsman. It had etches in the sides of the rocks that Ezreal didn&rsquo;t understand.\n\nThere was a door with engravings on it. To an explorer like Ezreal, this was the sign of treasure. The door let out a screech as it creaked open. Pitch-black darkness filled the room. Ezreal felt his luck had turned when he reached into his satchel to bring out a match. It struck against some stone to reveal many engravings on each of the four walls. Ezreal&rsquo;s attention was brought towards a magnificent portrait of what looked to be an emperor and his advisor. \n\nThe etchings could be read inside the room. Ezreal depicted them aloud, &ldquo;Two once great allies let their lust for power bring treachery between their camaraderie. This magic was made to keep the one who sought endless power at bay. This talisman shall be worn by the guardian who will save Runeterra from all evil.&rdquo;\n\nIn the corner of his eye, Ezreal beheld a metal glove. It looked normal, nothing seemed too strange about it. The shine seemed as if it was new, it wasn&rsquo;t worn out and there was a blue gem that sat idly on the palm of the glove.\n\nEzreal wiped the sweat from his brow, &ldquo;This must be what Uncle Lyte meant by artifact, but it&rsquo;s just a stupid glove.&rdquo; Ezreal looked for any sign of a trap however it was too dark to make any guesses to whether there were any.\n\nFinally, after pondering for a good while, Ezreal reached for the glove. It felt odd when the cold steel touched his skin. It looked like it would rest upon a left hand.\n\nAs Ezreal took off his black, finger-less glove, and substituted it for the metallic talisman. The gold shine was distinct in the dark. The glove seemed to fit snugly upon his arm.\n\nSuddenly the gem started to glow a radiant sapphire. Ezreal&rsquo;s frustration was instantly changed to bewilderment. The glow started to brighten as Ezreal stared at the gem. \n\n&ldquo;What the-&ldquo; Ezreal&rsquo;s words stopped as a huge turquoise explosion obliterated the sandstone dome around him. It left nothing but a spherical, blue ball of arcane energy surrounding him. His face lighted up as he started to levitate upwards inside the ball. It seemed to protect him from anything, including the cold.\n\n&ldquo;Woah, maybe I should come to Shurima more often.&rdquo; Ezreal opined as he clenched his hand into a fist. The ball disappeared as Ezreal fell to the ground with a massive thud. The gem still glowed but it was a soft shade of yellow now. Ezreal got up while grabbing his left arm in agony. &ldquo;Alright, I gotta work on that.&rdquo; He laughed as he brought his to his hair.\n\nHe raised his arm parallel to the sands and closed his eyes. It seemed as if the magic inside him was finally coming out. Then out of nowhere a bright yellow light came out the palm of the glove in the shape of a semicircle. It hovered just above the sands as the yellows began to mix until the light could no longer be seen.\n\n&ldquo;This changes everything.&rdquo; Ezreal exclaimed as he began to sprint in the direction of the already fired light.\n\n~\n\nA month had passed since that journey, Ezreal seemed to wear his glove everywhere on his adventures. He became known as the &ldquo;Prodigal Explorer&rdquo; by many of his peers, exceeding everyone&rsquo;s expectations of him. He knew that with his newly found powers, he had to save the people like the inscription said. \n\nEzreal searched across Runeterra until he found the Institute of War, a place where heroes would battle for political disputes. He decided that with his skills and his glove, Runeterra would finally be saved. Although his true allegiance stayed with Piltover, he wanted Valoran to finally be at peace.\n\nHe exulted with glee as he strode into the halls, &ldquo;The name&rsquo;s Ezreal, I&rsquo;m here for the League of Legends.&rdquo;\n\nA robed man walked up to him and gestured towards a ginormous painting. It was a masterpiece. A portrait of vines weaving within one another to create a giant tree in the centre of the wall. The man stated sharply, &ldquo;Show us what you can do.&rdquo;\n\nEzreal smirked at the cloaked figure as he aimed his glove at the shrine, the gem shined a bright blue light as a mystical white light shot out of Ezreal&rsquo;s palm. The wall seemed to shatter like glass and crashed against the ground with a loud rumble. People from beyond the wall looked into the room with utter shock on their faces. The man in the robes eyes widened as he marveled at Ezreal.\n\nEzreal laughed, &ldquo;So, is that it?&rdquo;\n\nThe face under the cloak raised a brow, &ldquo;No, because it&rsquo;s going to take a lot more than luck to join the League.&rdquo; \n\n&ldquo;Good,&rdquo; Ezreal affirmed as he let out another laugh while walking toward the man, &ldquo;And there was no luck in that. It&rsquo;s all skill.&rdquo;","replies":[{"poster":"Oneechan","date":"2016-07-10T11:49:21.758+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'm not too familiar with Ez's lore, but I feel you do him justice with this story.
