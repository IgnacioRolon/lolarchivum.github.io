Why are messages from 2 years ago appearing (ARE YOU KIDDING ME RIOT) as recent? Funny how I come full circle to patch problems but this time it&#039;s not your old buggy client; it is my garbo laptop.\r\n\r\nSpeaking of, I&#039;m guessing I need to uninstall/reinstall? Client is now corrupted if I try to open it (I get an alert that says so).\r\n\r\nThanks for dealing with my crap.\r\n\r\nP.S.

If you're unable to do that though, then the next best course of action is installing and running the [Hextech Repair Tool](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/224826367-Automated-Troubleshooting-Hextech-Repair-Tool). Then once you're in the Hextech Repair Tool, select \"Force Repatch\" and click start.\n\nRe-installing will probably fix the problem too, but the Hextech Repair Tool might save you a complete re-install if the issue can be fixed with just a repatch.\n\nLet me know if you run into any issues :D\n\nP.S The messages aren't from 2 years ago, Riot's testing their new Zilean-tech in the client this patch. It sends everyone 2 years back in time, so make sure you buy some Bitcoin while you're there ;)","replies":[{"poster":"Valentine s Day","date":"2018-03-10T06:07:26.471+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"dosen't work at all{{sticker:zombie-brand-facepalm}}","replies":[{"poster":"Tele","date":"2018-03-10T08:37:45.209+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Oh no!\n\n{{sticker:sg-janna}} \n\nDo you know what part isn't working?
