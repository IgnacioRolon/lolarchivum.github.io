I made this thread because there have been a lot of times when I'm not sure if it is worth buying a champion I'd like to play. The idea is that if you want to buy a champion, but you don't know if they're good enough, or you can't choose between two to buy, you an post in this thread asking people for advice/their opinion and some pros and cons on the matter.\r\n\r\nI'll start off.\r\nI usually play ad assassins like Yasuo, Master Yi, and occasionally Hecarim. I don't really main a specific role. I can play top, mid, jungle, and support quit well. I'm wondering if it's worth buying Renekton. Is he a good high damage champion? Would there be someone else better suited to a top lane, quite tanky, high damage, no mana playstyle? If so please tell me who, if not then what are some pros and cons for Renekton.\r\n\r\nTL:DR\r\nIf you're not sure about buying a champion, post here. If you see someone asking about a champion you know about, post here to help them. What are pros and cons for buying Renekton?\r\n\r\nP.S. This is one of my first threads, if there is another thread exactly the same as this could you redirect me and I'll close this one.","replies":[{"poster":"Jehovahs Witness","date":"2015-02-08T01:25:07.353+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Play Darius.","replies":[]},{"poster":"NinjaNumber12","date":"2015-02-07T08:42:55.582+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Renekton is my main outside of the support role so I play him a fair amount. The good thing about Renek is he is easy to learn, he has a fairly easy to master attack pattern and he is very hard to kill.\nThe Pros\nHard to kill\nFairly tanky, brings utility with stun\nPersonally I've only really been destroyed in lane by a Nidalee, most match-ups you can trade fine if you don't feed\n\"resourceless\" means high sustain\nGap closer or good escape tool as needed\n\nThe Cons.\nIf the rest of your team doesn't contain cc, there are other tanks that do utility better\nHis damage, whilst fair isn't steller\nHis attack pattern is predictable\n\nI guess it depends on your Elo. For the moment Renek isn't amazingly popular but he's seen every now and then. This means anyone who has faced Renekton before probably knows what they're in for and at higher elo's that means they WILL find a way to counter you. Thus if you are up there with people who play well consistently you'd be better off with someone who offers more.\nHowever if you're a scrub like myself then Renek is a good purchase, I rarely lose a game on him.\nI hope this helps. :)\n\nPersonally I'm wondering if I should pick up an Assassin like Ahri, or a utility mage like Orianna","replies":[]},{"poster":"Wild Card Shaco","date":"2015-02-06T23:47:02.150+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"*sigh* bump","replies":[]},{"poster":"Garens Harem","date":"2015-01-27T08:29:45.737+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"im thinking of diana in the mid lane\n\n\nPls tell me pros and cons","replies":[]},{"poster":"Wild Card Shaco","date":"2015-01-27T08:14:10.686+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"bump","replies":[]},{"poster":"Wild Card Shaco","date":"2015-01-21T00:32:22.801+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"bump","replies":[]},{"poster":"Blood Harvest","date":"2015-01-19T13:40:56.640+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"\"I usually play ad assassins like Yasuo, Master Yi, and occasionally Hecarim\"\nSince when was Hecarim an assasin\nHes a fight/tank\n\n\nAnd for Renekton\n\nHigh damage\nHigh sustain\nMobile\nNo hard counters\nEasy to learn\nGenerally fun","replies":[{"poster":"Wild Card Shaco","date":"2015-01-20T00:58:12.252+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Xerioum,realm=OCE,application-id=Ntey9fRZ,discussion-id=bJtHpNju,comment-id=0001,timestamp=2015-01-19T13:40:56.640+0000)\n>\n> \"I usually play ad assassins like Yasuo, Master Yi, and occasionally Hecarim\"\n> Since when was Hecarim an assasin\n> Hes a fight/tank\n> \n> \n> And for Renekton\n> \n> High damage\n> High sustain\n> Mobile\n> No hard counters\n> Easy to learn\n> Generally fun\n\nI meant to say assassins like Yasuo and Master Yi, and i occasionally play Hecarim as well.
