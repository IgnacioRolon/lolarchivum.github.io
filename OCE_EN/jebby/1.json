And have held a pretty solid 60% win rate after watching tonnes of videos and gameplays.\r\n\r\nThe problem is is I have plateued, and like every player, I don&rsquo;t want to say it, but I&rsquo;m stuck.\r\n\r\nBut I don&rsquo;t find it any different, I still average over 60% win rate if I get my role I&rsquo;ve sole myself too, yet if I get filled I lose almost 100% of the time, I main 1 champ but can play 3 efficiently.\r\n\r\nMy problem is, is do I learn a laning role (I main jungle) or do I keep focusing on my game as is and rely on getting my role. Whenever I get filled I get roasted saying don&rsquo;t play ranked if you can&rsquo;t play all the roles, is this true or should I stick to my game.\r\nI can play mid pretty well as I&rsquo;m pretty mechanically good from previous gaming experience, just not good enough to risk it in ranked, so I set support as my secondary role as I&rsquo;m not relied on a heavy and as long as I keep the ADC healthy it seems very easy.\r\n\r\nHigher level players please feel free to add and chat, I could really use a mentor.\r\n\r\n-Jebby\r\n-Silver 5","replies":[]}
