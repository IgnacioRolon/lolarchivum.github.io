I see you recently went ona  big winstreak, which means you probably had a negative win rate before which tanked your MMR.\nAlso don't believe any website that claims to know your MMR, they are all guesses. Riot has never released the calculations they do to determine MMR for fear of people min/maxing the system.\n\nYou are now finally back on 50% which means as long as you keep winning your MMR should recover slightly. You need to maintain a 55% or so winrate to get \"good\" LP gains.","replies":[]},{"poster":"BurstFire304","date":"2018-05-29T01:44:38.350+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"its not the amount of games you win or the winrate that matters. its who you are vsing. if you are gold 5 vsing silver 2 you wont earn as much as gold 5 vs gold 5. in terms of \"what can i do\" you need to become BETTER at league of legends. watch pros, youtube videos etc etc. if you become BETTER you will win vs better players and your MMR (basically the elo score you have which determines if you vs silver or gold players) will increase.","replies":[]},{"poster":"deceit1520","date":"2018-05-29T01:13:02.236+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"and stop playing with kaniff ,he is tanking your gains","replies":[]},{"poster":"deceit1520","date":"2018-05-29T01:07:44.497+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"you have silver 2 mmr,so u will gain bugger all man,u need a duo partner,cos when u lose u lose massive lp,try not to lose so much","replies":[]}]}
