Don't think that just because there isn't a tribunal that nothing is being done!\n\nRight now we have multiple automatic systems in place to punish negative behaviour; for example\n\nLive\n\n**LeaverBuster** (this is the system that punishes afkers)\nChat restrictions\nIntentional feeder bans\nManual audits\nCurrently testing\n\nAutomatic verbal abuse bans\nThis is of course just the negative stuff, we are also working on ways to promote and recognize positive play within our community as well!\nhttp://oce.leagueoflegends.com/en/news/game-updates/special-event/celebrating-end-years-snowdown\n\nOur player behavior philosophies include punishment, reform, and positive reinforcement. There's no silver bullet to improving player behavior in online games, and you always need a mix of punishments and rewards. You can read more about our design philosophies here: http://oce.leagueoflegends.com/en/news/game-updates/player-behavior/exploring-player-behavior-design-values\n\nIf you're really interested in player behaviour give this video a watch it is Jeffrey \"Lyte\" Lin talking about \"The Science Behind Shaping Player Behavior in Online Games\".\nhttp://gdcvault.com/play/1017940/The-Science-Behind-Shaping-Player","replies":[{"poster":"Breawien","date":"2015-01-21T03:08:39.246+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"You can toot your own horn as much as you want, but you know it's not good enough...

Can you tell us that there is ANY improvements being made in OUR region? just so that I might have some hope for the future because to be perfectly honest, it's getting more and more difficult to enjoy the game to the point where uninstalling is becoming a serious option.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"LeThunderer","date":"2015-01-21T03:51:11.374+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Well i've just played a ranked game which had the following player: http://matchhistory.oce.leagueoflegends.com/en/#match-details/OC1/76274693/200094855?tab=overview\n\nIrelia was muted post champion select after basically stating that he was \"god\" and that we should \"obey\" him. Noone said anything in response. After roughly 5 minutes, he proceeded to run down middle to die and die again. The general idea that I collected by reading the chat logs of other team members is that since we didn't immediately gank his lane early and often, we didn't obey god and thus we will be punished.\n\nWe need a tribunal. \n\nI am disgusted by this behaviour and this is becoming more and more frequent.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Ing√©nue","date":"2015-01-20T21:53:26.357+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Did they rage quit?
