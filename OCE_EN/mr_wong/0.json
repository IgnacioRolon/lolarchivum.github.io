It got so annoying in the matches I played yesterday that I just logged off mid game. Told my team mates before hand. Sure I was reported, when I logged on I get the LeaveBuster Warning that I need to write \"I agree\" not to quit or go afk. I will wait till after its over before I do the acknowledgement. Im not going to play LoL whilst its on anyway so there is no point typing \"I accept\" because if I start a game and there are Draven bobble heads I will just quit again.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Far Fetched","date":"2016-04-01T10:53:39.908+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Is there sesriously no way to do that?
