I love the idea of rune pages, don&#039;t get my wrong. Being able to craft pages which you deem strong for a certain champion is quite nice, but why does it have to come at the cost of hours and days of grinding games just to unlock specific runes and pages. This can be said about the undesirable levelling to 30 waste of time for the majority of the community as well as new users. For riot to keep popular they have to appeal to the new and old users by making runes free as well as instant level 30 account. Thoughts ?","replies":[{"poster":"Nijel","date":"2016-08-24T08:43:37.339+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I have a feeling that something is going to get more affordable in season 7. Either we're going to see rune pages reduced in cost so that the grind to fill those rune pages isn't as lengthy or we're going to see a price reduction in the runes themselves. Of course, if rune pages pull a decent amount in RP sales I'd imagine it would be the latter. Further, I wouldn't expect runes to become free because that might prove to be an unpopular decision amongst those who have invested the time to purchase them, which is really too bad considering free runes would be a godsend for newer or less experienced players who might be forced to learn more champs if 10 bans are introduced.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Sloth Almighty","date":"2016-08-23T09:49:26.344+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I disagree. When achieving accomplishments in games are too easy or just a given, the game becomes stale very fast.\nNot sure how much of the community I speak for here, but when I play games I play it for the achievement factor, not necessarily \"to win\" or \"to conquer\".\nGames of old where you conquer it, get put away and are lucky to see any more screen time, except for maybe nostalgia sake years on.\nGames that can't be truly conquered, but have achievements well beyond the skill level of the 'average user', gives a sense of stubborn pride to the user, they don't wanna be beaten they just wanna reach the next level or achievement, be it (in this case) a level, rank, rune or mastery. Most of us won't ever reach challenger in league, but that's the beauty of the challenge is to better your skills to aim for what seems an improbable task.\nIts because this game brings such a broad spectrum of achievements well beyond the reach of most, that makes it unique and enjoyable.\nA game that's too easy gets boring fast.\nAdd achievements that get progressively harder to obtain yet always within grasp, it keeps interest","replies":[{"poster":"Hawkei","date":"2016-08-23T10:08:30.527+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I agree with what you are saying about a game continuously having challenges, however, runes do not reward the average player. most people who play won't have hundreds of thousands of IP. it can take people weeks just to unlock a few runes which only change a small percentage of the game. This is where it doesn't become a challenge, but a grind. When it's a grind it becomes stale and boring when all you sort out for is something so minuscule before even playing the game.","replies":[{"poster":"Sloth Almighty","date":"2016-08-23T10:20:05.172+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I guess keeping the end user interested in a game is all subjective to the end user itself.\nUltimately a game is created with a certain goal in mind, the end user will either be attracted to the idea or won't be. I guess league was never aimed at the jump-straight-into-saiyan-mode market, it's more for the longevity market of players.\nHaving said that, I really don't see Riot implementing any form of insta power start anytime soon","replies":[{"poster":"DipperOCE","date":"2016-08-23T10:53:54.035+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You shouldn't have to go at a disadvantage because you haven't played as long as someone else.
