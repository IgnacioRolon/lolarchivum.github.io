Ping is terrible here and it means I can&#039;t play some champions or situations as well as people with lower ping, I&#039;ve noticed it affecting my abilities to make clutch plays particularly.\r\n\r\nThe biggest issue is that all of the servers for any sort of ping &quot;fixer&quot; is in the eastern states... I&#039;ve run WTFast and Battleping to get a 100 ping minimum, which is very different to my stable 95 (outside of any peak usage periods, at which point it skyrockets to 300).\r\n\r\nSo yeah, if anyone could help me out I would greatly appreciate it!!","replies":[{"poster":"CyanShinobi","date":"2015-04-23T08:52:10.532+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I think it's OCE in general.\n\nI'm in East Aus, and have been having ping and Attempted to Reconnects (A2R) issues for about a month. Riot did the typical \"Run and submit a network diagnostics test\" then fails to respond to my submission. \n\nWhy can't they see it's not our end, it's RIOT's? Game is no longer fun.\n\nBest way to get a response is if no one played LoL until the server was fixed.\n\nApparently they're having this trouble in the UK but 1000x worse but still RIOT doesn't care as long as the money is still rolling in.\n\nOnce again, should start a petition ---> \"NO PLAY! NO PAY!\"","replies":[{"poster":"The Hand of","date":"2015-04-23T08:57:56.234+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Your issue is definitely different. Mine is simply the fact that in WA you get a minimum of ~60 ping with the NBN, let alone a standard internet connection.\n\nI understand that I should be able to read the opponent's actions etc etc but it just hurts when your opponent uses Zhonya's while you spam a point and click on them, yet THEY hit you with an ability and you die...\n\nEDIT: Typing is hard ._.","replies":[{"poster":"CyanShinobi","date":"2015-04-23T12:43:02.675+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Haha~ You did well with the typing thing! :D . I understand your pain, especially when a winning 1 v 1 suddenly becomes a 1 v 5 and then your dead and the screen is still saying \"Attempting to Reconnect\"... >___<;\n\n>Copied from another thread< \nAt the moment I'm trying WTFast. So far that has seemed to fix my problem. I'll let you know via this board about whether WTFast or the maintenance has fixed the problem. :) \nAlso, I don't know if anyone else has had this problem but, quite a few times this year when I've logged onto LoL, or just started a game, the LoL client will completely kick me off the internet. My computer would then be unable to find any wireless networks. I would have to restart my computer to fix it. It only happened with LoL. Has this happened to anyone else?<End Copy>\n\n~CyanShinobi~ \n\n:D","replies":[{"poster":"The Hand of","date":"2015-04-24T00:27:16.416+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I appreciate the sentiment, but the biggest issue is that VPN's go through their own servers, which are all still on the other side of the country if that makes sense?","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"ElysiumManifests","date":"2015-04-23T09:44:26.238+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hello all,\n\nThought I should weigh in here. \n\nRiot knows there is a problem and is planning a maintenance that will hopefully correct recent issues (http://boards.oce.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/announcements/rLiFIegm-updatednetwork-maintenance-24042015 ).\n\nThe use of a VPN is effective in correcting ping issues because it alters the signal path from your machine to the servers in Sydney. Try Hotspot Shield (http://www.hotspotshield.com/) it's free and easy to use; all you have to do is change the 'Virtual Location' to 'Australia'.\n\nIf your issues don't clear up after the maintenance I might be able to try a trick or two. Is there any way I can contact you; Skype? Email?\n\nGood Luck!,\n\n~ORION~","replies":[{"poster":"The Hand of","date":"2015-04-24T01:17:29.659+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Are you on in game often? Because 9 times out of 10 I'm on client if I'm not busy, so that might be a better communication method.\n\nAlso, the maintenance has happened and that hasn't affected my ping, it's been this high since, well, forever. I'm trying Hotspot Shield now, I'll see if that makes a difference, although I doubt it will at this stage ;-;\n\nUpdate: Tried Hotspot Shield, the pro version, and it rocketed my ping to 350ms average. Note when I speak of my ping I mean in AND out of game, it's not Riot's issue.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"xSilverRosex","date":"2015-04-23T13:04:32.580+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hmm that's really strange, I'm playing from Perth with 69-72 ping with really bad internet speed of less than 1mb upload & download","replies":[{"poster":"KagamiArata","date":"2015-04-24T08:42:05.734+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I live in Perth too and my ping is 70-80 and sometimes lag spikes happens and i get ping like 200-700 which is pretty insane.","replies":[]},{"poster":"The Hand of","date":"2015-04-24T00:33:14.855+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Omg, may I ask who you're with?
