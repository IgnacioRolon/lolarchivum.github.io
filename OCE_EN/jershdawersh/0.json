Im going to preface this with I'm not the best AD Carry but I do have some experience with it. First off what is ADC? Its generally a ranged Attack Damage champion that scales well off gold and items, think Caitlyn, Jinx, Miss Fortune and Ashe. They generally duo botlane with a support.\n\nId suggest looking up some pro players to see how you play it. The Chiefs (pro team) Raydere or ex DireWolves K1ng are great peopleto youtube as they are really good.\n\nIf you have any questions let me know or add me in client.\n\n<3 Spawn","replies":[{"poster":"Darthski","date":"2016-01-05T07:15:50.607+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"On a side note.

They are normally ranged AD champions that go bottom lane with a support.\n\nIf you go to your champion tab in client and type in marksman, you should see the traditional ADCs. There a few marksman that aren't ADCs like {{champion:268}} and {{champion:17}}  though.\n\nAs an ADC it is your job to deal out as much damage as possible while also staying relatively safe. Your job is to provide the most persistant damage in your team.\nBecause of your role, you are expected to build a lot of damage and attack speed items and very little defence since its your job to provide damage\n\nHowever ADC's are also very squishy (easy to kill) so you need to learn how to position yourself as well as choose the right targets in order to keep yourself safe and win the fight at the same time.\n\n------------------------------------------------\n\nJax is not a \"marksman\". He is a Fighter/Bruiser and is normally played alone in the top lane or in the jungle. He is a great champion though and was one of the first champions I played when I first started.\n\nAs a Fighter Jax usually like to build 1 or 2 damage items then build tanky. Something like a Trinity Force then some armour and health items would be good. or more recently building Rageblade, Gunblade then tanky items.\n\n------------------------------------------------\n\nMay I suggest using sites such as [probuilds.net](http://www.probuilds.net/) to see what you should build on champions and also the runes and masteries that are optimal.","replies":[]}]}
