Or to those who are disconnected due to a network problem as opposed to those who just simply go afk. I know that things like these aren&#039;t as easy to create and implement as they sound but the fact that I can be trying to reconnect and do so multiple times during a game and then after all of the effort still get put into low priority is a bit ridiculous. \r\nI am not trying to be hypocritical because i know personally that I am guilty of being put into low priority for both afking due to simply not having enough time to finish due to other things that happen in life and because of network and computer problems, I also understand that the low priority system is there to send people a message about making sure that they have enough time to play a full game of league but I think that it could be improved drastically in the way that it needs to categorise afk players as per whether or not they are attempting to reconnect or otherwise. \r\nThese are my views I would like to see how the rest of the public sees this system \r\nThank You","replies":[{"poster":"Megamind Player","date":"2015-08-23T02:21:34.008+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"fix this crap my internet crashed so now i have to wait (20minX5) now i feel as if i don't want to play league {{champion:32}} {{item:3070}}","replies":[]}]}
