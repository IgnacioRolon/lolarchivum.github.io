It's not allowed on the forums. I suggest not connecting all your accounts to social media and/or using the same name, to prevent people from easily finding them. If they bother you elsewhere please report them to the moderators there and block them. Try not to divulge personal information here, either (you just posted your name again).\n\n-DTN","replies":[{"poster":"Hornattack","date":"2016-02-04T12:46:54.807+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"the thing is deep terror nami is that the social media account that they found was one that was only used for work. it was not linked to any of my other accounts the only people i had added was people they dont play league. 2 freinds on that account. so its no my fault that they found my social media page. they were digging deep, and this is. well, creepy","replies":[{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2016-02-05T02:05:26.636+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I believe there are relatively easy ways (for those that know how at least) to find linked accounts that are using the same email address or the same username. If you use the same email address for your fb and your LoL, even if they aren't linked, that is likely how they found it. \n\nYou'd be unfortunately surprised how much data and personal information is out there, it serves well to be very careful, and to expect something like this to happen at least once. It's never a good feeling, but it is something that you will do well to be aware of. \n\nContact fb support as well, they can likely help you to take action against this person.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Hornattack","date":"2016-02-04T12:49:00.373+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"i would also like to say that i am oce. and each time i have wrote to the support over here. they do nothing about it.","replies":[{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2016-02-05T02:02:42.047+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Sometimes it will take them a day or two to get back to you, but they will always respond. If you explain that this person has found personal information is harassing you then they will do all they can to help you, but there is nothing they can do about your facebook. Blocking them on fb should be enough, but if they keep harassing you then find the fb support and explain the situation to them. They will usually (to the best of my knowledge at any rate) take that sort of thing very seriously, and will likely take action against the person.","replies":[]}]}]}]}
