The three of them had been invited to this year&#039;s annual Pool Party, and boy oh boy was Zoe ever going to pass up something that sounded *this* fun.\n\n&quot;Get your swimsuit ready, we&#039;re leaving soon!&quot; Caitlyn called, putting on a jacket over her bikini top. \n&quot;&#039;Kay!&quot; the reply came back as the girl bounced upstairs.\n\nThe sheriff of Piltover rarely had it easy, but when the invitation to this year&#039;s Pool Party came up, the opportunity to kick back, exchange her hextech rifle for a squirt gun and just let loose for once was too good to pass up. &quot;How are you doing over there, Gangplank?&quot; \n\n&quot;Fine&hellip;&quot; with a grunt, the pirate heaved the crates of barbeque meat into the back of the car, &quot;and dandy!&quot; he finished, slamming the trunk shut. With that load off his shoulders, he started spinning around a spatula in his fingers like a Demacian honour student would spin a pen. &quot;So where&#039;s that little squirt up to?&quot;\n\n&quot;Right here!&quot; Zoe&#039;s voice bounced down the stairs as Caitlyn and Gangplank turned to see and-\n\nGangplank&#039;s spatula spun out from his hands. With nothing in her own hands to drop and no liquid in her mouth to spurt out, Caitlyn could only stare, horrified at Zoe&#039;s&hellip; swimsuit, if you could call it that.\n\n&quot;Well? How do I look?&quot; Zoe asked, either oblivious or ignoring the two&#039;s horrified faces.\n\nWhat Zoe had on was a &#039;swimsuit&#039; comprised of mainly string and small patches of cloth that reached over and around her shoulders and thighs to preserve the bare minimum of modesty. While Runeterra did not yet have a specific term for this outfit yet, people of Earth would call it a &#039;microbikini.&#039; Worse, what Zoe currently had on was the type you would almost certainly never find in a conventional swimsuit store, being more string than fabric and using only the absolute bare minimum amount of cloth to cover up the parts that would be censored on terrestrial Ionian broadcasting. Needless to say, it was a look that was decidedly *un*wholesome on a girl that looked like she was barely in her pre-teens.\n\n&quot;Zoe,&quot; Caitlyn resisted the urge to facepalm. &quot;Where did you get that?&quot; Beside her, Gangplank showed no reservations as palm met face with a meaty SMACK! as he slid down the wall.\n\n&quot;This? My outfit? I got it from big sis Evelynn! It was in one of her outfit boxes labelled &#039;sexy swimsuits!&#039; Besides, Ahri wears these all the time for her&hellip; what did she call them again? &#039;Gravure shoots&#039; or something?&quot;\n&quot;Okay, firstly, did you ask Evelynn if you could borrow them, and second, stop calling her big sister, you&#039;re far older than&hellip;&quot; Caitlyn tailed off as she realised that due to the circumstances of Runeterra&#039;s creation, Evelynn actually WAS one of the few Champions that were older than Zoe.\n\nZoe continued, &quot;Ehh, it&#039;s only stealing if you don&#039;t return it before it&#039;s missed! Besides, Eve would totally approve of me going out in this! Even more if it gets Ezreal to look at me over that dumb blonde broad that only wants to take Ez&#039;s Mystic Shots up her-&quot;\n\nBang! Zoe&#039;s head snapped back as Caitlyn headshot her with a rubber bullet from her squirt gun. How does one fire a rubber bullet from a toy plastic squirt gun, you ask? Only with the finest hextech materials, Made in Piltover&trade;.\n\n&quot;Language, kiddo. Besides, Lux and Ezreal aren&#039;t even coming this year.&quot; Caitlyn pumped her squirt gun as Zoe nursed her forehead. Once again, she resisted the urge to slowly and repeatedly bash her head against the walls. Not even Evelynn would dress Zoe or Annie up like this, considering what happened during that time the servers went down. She was 99.9% certain that she wouldn&#039;t do&hellip; things with those two, but then again, she WAS Evelynn, after all.\n\nSomewhere in a seedy bar in the Noxian capital, a disguised lust demon sneezed.\n\n&quot;Gangplank?&quot; Caitlyn turned to the pirate, who had his hands in his palms and mumbling incoherently. Listening in, she heard something like:\n&quot;don&#039;tcalltheFBIItwasntmeofficeriswearionlypiratedadult-&quot;\n&quot;Gangplank!&quot;\n\nThat seemed to snap the pirate out his stupor, as his eyes came to focus on the markswoman. \n\n&quot;What now?&quot; Caitlyn asked. &quot;We sure as hell aren&#039;t going with Zoe in that.&quot;\n&quot;Well&hellip;&quot; Gangplank began, before his eyes lit up. &quot;I&#039;m calling Mundo.&quot;\n&quot;Mundo?&quot; Caitlyn&#039;s eyebrow rose. &quot;What does Mundo have to do with this?&quot; \n&quot;Well, he&#039;s got some corporate connections that might be able to help us out here, plus worst come to worst, he knows the best lawyers.&quot; Gangplank pulled out his phone and began dialling.\n&quot;You do realise I am a cop, right?&quot;\n&quot;No cop is above the law, you of all people should know that. Besides- hey Mundo, can you help an old friend out here?&quot;\n\nCaitlyn could only watch as Gangplank talked with the self-professed doctor over the phone.\n\n&quot;Sorry, I know you&#039;re already there but- Yes, this is that bad. A little girl got her hands on something that she absolutely shouldn&#039;t have. Yes, from Evelynn&#039;s stash. Yes, that would be great. Cool. Teleport in ten? Bye.&quot; Gangplank hung up.\n&quot;Caitlyn, could you chuck down a ward? Anything&#039;s fine as long as it&#039;s not Farsight.&quot;\nCaitlyn obliged, activating a Control Ward. &quot;He coming?&quot; she asked.\n\nAlmost before she asked a telltale beam of light and distinctive channelling noise of a Teleport appeared on the Stealth Ward before a purple Zaunian giant with a straw hat and very comfy shorts materialised from the light.\n\n&quot;Mundo is here, so what is problem?&quot;\n&quot;Mundo!&quot; \n\nZoe jumped onto the top lane tank, clinging to his midriff. Mundo immediately and unceremoniously peeled her off. &quot;How many times has Mundo told you not to-&quot; \n\nMundo noticed Zoe&#039;s attire.\n\n&quot;Oh Mundo.&quot;\n&quot;Mhm.&quot;\n&quot;See what we mean?&quot;\n\nA giant slab of meat that was Mundo&#039;s hand met Mundo&#039;s face. &quot;Mundo takes it that is what needs fixing?&quot;\n&quot;Yep.&quot;\n&quot;Please.&quot;\n\nMundo pulled out his phone.\n\n&quot;Corporate boss Mundo knows some people. Mundo try calling people from company called &#039;Riot,&#039; might be able to solve problem.&quot;\n\nAs the dial tone went on, Mundo grumbled, &quot;Need strong words with design team for this- ah, yes, this is Mundo! Yes, big executive boss Mundo! Transfer Mundo to outfits team, the one in charge of annoying little Targonian girl-&quot;\n&quot;Hey!&quot; Zoe complained, but Mundo ignored her.\n&quot;Yes? Yes, little Targonian suffering catastrophic wardrobe failure. What line? Pool Party of course, why else would Mundo need to call for *clothes*- TP in ten minutes? Make it one!&quot;\n\nMundo hung up. \n\n&quot;Help coming.&quot; he said.\n\nSixty-seven seconds later, the control ward that Mundo had arrived from began to shine again with the light of another incoming Teleport; an Ionian-looking man appeared from the light, before summarily vomiting into a bucket Mundo held out. \n\n&quot;You&#039;re big bro Bo Chen? Don&#039;t worry, interdimensional travel is often difficult for Mundo too, not just Earthlings.&quot;\n&quot;I jump through space and time all the time and I&#039;m perfectly fine!&quot;\n&quot;Hush, annoying little girl.&quot;\n\nThe Ionian-looking man - Bo Chen - turned his eyes up towards the source of high-pitched voice, before immediately shutting them again. \n\n&quot;Let me guess,&quot; Bo sighed. &quot;Pool party plus wardrobe disaster plus FBI alert meant Zoe doing something dumb with her clothes that you guys want me to do something about.&quot;\n\nThree nods. Bo pulled out his phone.\n\n&quot;Something more like this?&quot; He asked, pointing to a specific image on his phone.\n\nThree pairs of eyes came to rest on the screen, followed by unanimous nods.\n\n&quot;Alright then&hellip;&quot; Four pairs of eyes turned to Zoe, who froze instantly. &quot;Hold her down.&quot;\n\n&nbsp;\n***** \n&nbsp;\n\n&quot;Stay still, Zoe - ow! Did you just bite me?!&quot;\n&quot;Muuurgh! Zoe, stop throwing stars and seagulls and water balloons at Mundo! Mundo may be Masochist but not from little girls!&quot;\n&quot;I swear, officer, I had nothing to do with this.&quot;\n\n&nbsp;\n***** \n&nbsp;\n\nAnother twenty minutes later, after Bo returned to his original world&hellip;\n\n&quot;I don&#039;t like this outfit.&quot; Zoe grumbled, squashed up between Mundo&#039;s giant frame and the window. &quot;It&#039;s too&hellip; childish.&quot;\n&quot;We&#039;ve got Fiora and Leona there as well. I don&#039;t want you to get thrown out for obscenity. Then you wouldn&#039;t have any fun at all.&quot; Caitlyn said from the shotgun seat.\n\nGangplank pulled the handbrake. &quot;We&#039;re here, guys!&quot;\n\n&quot;Wahaha! About time! Annoying little Targonian girl, race you for first cannonball!&quot; Mundo started running as soon as he got out of the car.\n&quot;Hey, that&#039;s cheating!&quot; Zoe hurriedly ran after him, forgetting all her complaints about her swimsuit.\n\n&nbsp;\n***** \n&nbsp;\n\nLulu and Zac were happily paddling away when a giant shadow loomed over them.\n\n&quot;Look out below!&quot;\n&quot;CANNONBALLLLLL!!&quot;\n\nAnd so the two cannonballs detonating in the water marked the start of 2018&#039;s annual pool party.","replies":[]}
