Unfortunately when you get to the higher MMR's the number of players around your level is very low (because few make it to your level of play!). So sometimes to find a fair game the match making system will need to expand the range at which it looks for players. This means once in awhile you will get some plat players in your games. \n\nSure this could be fixed if we gave you hour + queue times. But do you really want to increase queue times by an immense amount just so you don't get plat teams once in awhile?","replies":[]},{"poster":"y u feed me","date":"2016-12-29T04:26:23.123+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Your point about the point loss issue is spot on and riot know this, tbh I really don't think they care, I am not diamond nor will I ever be, but it doesn't take a genius to work out what riot do and don't care about, it is the same old story, use a bandaid to fix the problem, they have been doing this for 5 years that I have been playing. simple solutions\n\n#1  prompt user before asking them to join a match letting them know they have not been ideally matched asking them would they like to proceed.\n\n#2 using their mobile app to link high elo or any players letting them know at that particular time \"hey there quite a few players closely matched with you on the server now come and join\"\n\nit isn't so much do you want to wait longer, its mostly about peoples routines, and gaming routines when they are on, MOST people are usually on at the same times occasionally at random but more often at distinct times of the day and certain days you will find the same players in your matches. come on riot this really isn't rocket science please get your sht together your destroying a once decent game!","replies":[]},{"poster":"AndyIsMySenpai","date":"2016-04-07T23:52:34.839+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"if you dont some maths to the problem if i where to take this game as an example,(- 24 LP)http://matchhistory.oce.leagueoflegends.com/en/#match-details/OC1/128613131/204632352?tab=overview\nthen this game i won (+ 11 lp ) http://matchhistory.oce.leagueoflegends.com/en/#match-details/OC1/128612619/204632352?tab=overview\nbassicaly if i won 2 games and lost 1 i would still lose matched with plat players due to the Lp gains not being fair, if i where to win 3 games for every 1 loss i would gain points overall and uneless your raydere you woundet gain anything. and thats all for quicker ques so thats over 80 minutes in que over 4 games + 25-40 minutes per avg game and if i do any less then 3 wins to 1 loss i lose points its not worth it. 3 hours and 20 minutes if you avg out 4 games being played and que times and the circumstances to aucattly gain points are to small.","replies":[]},{"poster":"AndyIsMySenpai","date":"2016-04-07T10:33:28.163+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"i can play these games i wait 20 minutes on avg i play the game thats 50 minutes and im not much better off either way its not worth it for me,if you where to make the lp gains fair for me i guess i wouldent mind when your shafting my lp for the good of match making to show riot can match games quick im not going to be impressed.","replies":[]},{"poster":"AndyIsMySenpai","date":"2016-04-07T10:22:40.598+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"yeah sure in the plat games i won 11 lp and then lost -24 in the other so im all for the waiting personally but i dont speak on behalf of all the players, illd rather wait for a fair game tho.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Z3npachi","date":"2016-04-07T08:43:57.737+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thank dynamic que.

It happens in all ranks. Try playing in Silver where you don't get matched with silver you get match with bronze and they are not the smart bronze trying to climb either. \nThe worse part is you will lose more lp than everyone else because you are higher elo. And 3 games of this and you are back in bronze yourself.\nSo would people prefer to lose over and over again just so they get a quick game or wait. I have learnt my lesson now I am not even going to bother trying to support in low elo because you can not carry your way out of bronze as support.","replies":[]},{"poster":"AndyIsMySenpai","date":"2016-04-07T10:40:14.737+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"a good comparison would be if i could sleep with Pamela Anderson she has aids its gonna kill me either way or sleep with Jessica beil im gonna take beil any time of the day so dont put on a thorny dildo and consider my lp","replies":[]},{"poster":"NocNoc8","date":"2016-04-07T09:17:05.644+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Dynamic queue + oce just doesn't work.
