UNBAN ME!**\n\n\n>We understand that players may be forced to leave from time to time so the system has been designed to keep these situations in mind. After leaving a few games, you will be placed into a low priority queue; as long as you can complete 5 matchmade games without leaving, you will be returned to the normal queue. However, if you continue to leave games, you will remain in the low priority queue.","replies":[]}]}]}]}
