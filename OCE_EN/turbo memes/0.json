So it's not surprising that some players are vocal about it.","replies":[{"poster":"A Beard For All","date":"2019-11-17T01:10:59.099+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I disagree it has made games so much easier.

They always have stupid short term ideas to reduce toxicity. If only they kept skill in the game, and stopped giving free handouts to noobs, in the long run the game would be much better, like the end of Season 4/Early Season 5 days.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"A Beard For All","date":"2019-11-17T01:05:42.121+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You have only shown the community around leagues of legends is shit not the game itself.

Alchemist + max poison pool to prevent enemies from csing  with cheap mana health regen items (soul ring + regen boots + soul jar :D = overstay for more xp too) + ganking around after feeding off your lane to get more fed + crit tems + maxed or evenly upgraded stun + hide behind trees + more farming enemy champions and free cs = go away bloody shit metas that try to conform brainses (not the exact order). Does anybody know whether Dota champs gain levels while afk please because I remember most of  them leaving  1 by 1 and 1 pair (at levels 4-9) for no reason except seeing me woop the enemy team.
