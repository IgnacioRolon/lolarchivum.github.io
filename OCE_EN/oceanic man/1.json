It really does suck being bullied out of a role. Muting at the start of the flaming will at least stop you getting worked up from the harassment. Not much you can do in the situation when you're in game other than try to make it work. Sure it isn't ideal, but you can practice some of the mechanics of the champ regardless. Reporting them for the harassment side of things and a quick blurb of what happened will help the situation so PLEASE make sure you are using the report function when appropriate to do so.\n\nPairing up with some other summoners to go into game with will really help reduce this happening, so consider linking up with a Club or adding people after games you've enjoyed to requeue with. It makes your game more enjoyable and making new friends is always fun. \n\nI'm sorry to say there isn't exactly an end all solution currently for premades instalocking. But in making a pre-made yourself there is a lot less of a chance in running into the matter.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Talon12","date":"2016-03-24T14:10:39.823+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"oh my god. Déjà vu. \n\nI had that exact scenario....\n\n4 man premade... I called before any of them viktor mid... they all toxic and flaming. All game they treating me like trash because i was \"trolling with viktor supp\" i told them every time \"shut the fuck up %%%%s\" because legit the whole thing was just \"kys you fucking troll\" \"un install shit %%%%, you are worst trolling shitter ever\" and even more vile crap over and over and over for no reason. Then, they go all chat and say I'm say all that shit. Blah blah blah, few lies and shit from that premade later and i got unjust ban, so i went \"screw this game, nearly all games are similar to this shit anyway, toxic twelve yearolds every where, and they make me want to ram a stick down their throats they are so god damn annoying\"\n\nI roam around here now, because only around 10% of the boards are a total douche (lajneen), 35% more are socalising, and the rest are genuinely asking for help.","replies":[]},{"poster":"DianasGotSwag","date":"2016-03-24T11:55:09.305+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The more I sit back and ask myself if I want to play the game the more the answer becomes \"no\". Think of all the wasted hours not doing other things and having to sit through boring arse crap like you had to game after game even. What a waste of time, overall. Say you have had even just 20 games go like that and they all went for 40 minutes each, roughly. That's 13 hours of doing nothing fun. Now could you imagine feeling like shit for every waking moment of the day?","replies":[]}]}
