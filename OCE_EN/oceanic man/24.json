Without any proof or evidence but a faulty detecting system is not the way to go. i would think with the money u have u would invest in that. Im Done. I have barely played for year starting on the 15 July 2015 and am almost in Silver 5 just getting into Bronze 1 this week. I don&#039;t even a chance at URF anymore. Your game is fun, the community is fine. It&#039;s you that is the problem. Your unbalanced game makes people rage, Your stupid report system makes players laugh at you and ur unjustified ban system with no proof of anyone doing anything makes people sick of you. Was this what u had in mind? There are trolls out there, actual hackers still on the loose, people still rage quitting and u chose to focus on a guy who has done nothing against the code of conduct in any way shape or form that just show how you prioritise . Rioters my not read this, but i&#039;ve said what i have to say. I&#039;m done with league of legends. Some of u guys are thinking &quot;wrote this post cause mad that he got banned&quot; Not mad cause i was banned, mad cause the ban was unjustified.

However, if a program allows for the ability to do one of the \"Not fine\" things above in game, then we'll ban for the use of it, even if a player claims they are not using that option. \n\nAs stated VOs are allowed and has ben officially confirmed by a rioter and furthermore. ^ that statement refesr to such programs as MKLOL that gives jg timers that is against Riots law and just so happens that LVOC doesn't not have \n\nFine:\n- Any software that does not interfere directly with the in-game player experience between when you press “Play” and the end of game screen.
