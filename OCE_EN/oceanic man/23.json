Quote &quot;As an update to this, we&#039;re not banning for any VO replacements, but as with every other modification to League of Legends, anything you change is at your own risk.&quot; From Rioter Draggles EUW server and \r\nFine:\r\n- Any software that does not interfere directly with the in-game player experience between when you press &ldquo;Play&rdquo; and the end of game screen. VO mods are fine, they&#039;re localised to you and they don&#039;t give an advantage to your team.\r\n\r\nNot fine:\r\n- Exposing information that&rsquo;s intentionally obfuscated (cooldowns or timers)\r\n- Taking actions on your behalf (botting or scripting)\r\n- Drawing conclusions for you (predicting enemy positions)\r\n- Otherwise altering your field of intelligence (zoomhacks or global ult alerts)\r\n\r\nFrom the Ts and Cs. I have no other softwares open when i play league. Nothing. When i play league all i have open is league and maybe hearthstone. I feel like this ban is falsely put on me. {{item:3070}} {{item:3070}} {{item:3070}}  If u guys want to see a video of my desktop and an in game view of what i usually run i would be happy to film myself. I have sent 2 tickets to riot and would like to see progress happening. I have only played this game for about a year now and am almost to silver 5. With the arrival of URF game mode coming soon which i have yet to test myself as i joined in July of 2015 i would really wish my innocent would lift my falsely claimed ban.","replies":[{"poster":"Ingénue","date":"2016-04-19T11:57:32.744+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> I have sent 2 tickets to riot and would like to see progress happening.

In the meantime, please do not create multiple tickets for the same issue or continue adding information to/\"bumping\" your existing ticket as it will actually push your ticket to the back of the queue.\n\nJust be patient and they will get back to you soon.","replies":[{"poster":"Oceanic Man","date":"2016-04-19T12:18:13.375+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Also pls vote :)","replies":[{"poster":"Cherubi","date":"2016-04-23T03:12:24.493+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Oceanic my man.
