I have challenger friends that have a bad score when i play with them in norms coz they aren't playing a champ/role they are familiar with. \n\nThe riven you mentioned looks like they are still trying to learn riven (you can have mastery level 5 and still be trash at a champion). Maybe they got to gold last season by playing other champions? \n\nOn the other hand, you stated that you asked her how she lost. Thats pretty toxic dude, she was probably trying her hardest. In case you didn't realise, that is why they flamed you. Im not defending their actions, as flaming is never the answer but you really shouldn't have trash talked her.","replies":[{"poster":"Oceanic Man","date":"2016-02-21T09:46:22.538+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I didnt trash talking her. i was just famring and i heard that top tower has been taken and i was already tilted as i was so i simply asked how did vlad win lane and out of the sudden the whole enemy and my team just flamed me and the riven gets a free pass. not saying the shouldve flamed the riven but i didnt even do anything wrong b4 that point was just farming like a normal jg","replies":[{"poster":"Ingénue","date":"2016-02-21T10:22:49.127+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Oceanic Man,realm=OCE,application-id=T8eq2lFQ,discussion-id=UENRv19u,comment-id=00000000,timestamp=2016-02-21T09:46:22.538+0000)\n>\n> I didnt trash talking her. i was just famring and i heard that top tower has been taken and i was already tilted as i was so i simply asked how did vlad win lane and out of the sudden the whole enemy and my team just flamed me and the riven gets a free pass. not saying the shouldve flamed the riven but i didnt even do anything wrong b4 that point was just farming like a normal jg\n\nYe, but still the question was passive aggressive and obv the other people thought so (bonded over the salt from previous experience with the same question) or were premade with her and jumped to her defence. \n\nIn cases such as this, it is best just to wonder out loud instead of typing in chat","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Hyde","date":"2016-02-21T09:05:45.490+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":">>>> {{champion:92}} <<<< thats the problem right there, its a stereotype that Riven players are toxic ... I am sure its not true for some players ... but, Some people are just toxic and there is nothing you can do about it. It is quite likely they got lucky and somehow got placed into gold, and aren't actually that good. I was talking to a guy who got into Plat and pretty much just only played matches so they didn't decay. They don't really deserve the placement and if they actually tried to play ranked at that elo they would find they would lose a lot of games and go back into silver or bronze. It just happens sometimes and its best to just not even get hung up over it and keep having fun! :)","replies":[]}]}
