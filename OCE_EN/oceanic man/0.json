Oh god it is hard not to scream and yell and smash your monitor to dust but you just have to mute everyone who isn't a friend and try to keep your cool.","replies":[{"poster":"Oceanic Man","date":"2016-03-19T04:10:18.790+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Ok here is what i'm concerned of.

If they are just a bit tilted you'll likely change their minds, even if they don't say it. If they're full toxic then there isn't anything you can do to change their minds. They have already made their assessment of you and nothing you do or say will change that, no matter how illogical that is. \n\nAt that point it's better just to ignore them and move on. Defending yourself will only lower their opinion of you (filthy scrub needs to explain himself what a little b****) and will waste your time typing to them when you could instead be focusing on the game.\n\nDon't get me wrong, everyone falls into the trap occasionally. I know at least once I went FULL tilt at a guy who was just the most toxic person I'd ever seen, but it doesn't make it right. \n\nSo here is the advice I can give you. \n\nFirst of all take comfort in the fact that if they are toxic then they will face punishments same as you have, you are walking proof that the system works. If they continue to be toxic they will be banned, though you should probably take that as a warning as well.\n\nSecond is that if you feel yourself tilting, just stop. Take a few seconds, take a step away from your screen, adjust how you're sitting or whatever, just take a break and a deep breath. Let it go (as best you can), mute/ignore them and play the game to the best of your ability.\n\nThird is to remember that this is a game, and it is about winning SECOND. First it is about having FUN. If you aren't having fun, then why are you playing? You need to take that step back and remember why you play in the first place. If it's about making satisfying plays then look for opportunities to do so. If it's about improving then look at what you are doing wrong instead of blaming negativity and toxicity. Even if you succeed somewhere, is there a way you could have done it better. \n\nIf someone is being toxic then focus on the experience of the game rather than the experience of the people in it.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Lord Kylar Alice","date":"2016-03-18T14:11:47.881+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Oceanic Man,realm=OCE,application-id=FjGAIbRv,discussion-id=WLpJbbkV,comment-id=000000000000,timestamp=2016-03-18T13:51:34.828+0000)\n>\n> And on the note of why is time relevant because it is do they even check in game if the others are actually toxic or do they just check the reports\n\nThey read the full chat logs from games and tend to each player individually.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Lord Kylar Alice","date":"2016-03-18T14:10:46.512+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Oceanic Man,realm=OCE,application-id=FjGAIbRv,discussion-id=WLpJbbkV,comment-id=00000000,timestamp=2016-03-18T13:45:27.886+0000)\n>\n> U say false report will only get you punished...pls elaborate and also i don't got my chat thing i was so pissed i just closed it so i could write this. and for the part where u said \"how can you be toxic but not say wrong things\" there is a reason i put this \"message\" cause i was being sarcastic\n\nFalse reporting has been stated as an offence by Riot, and if a player is found to be continuously sending false reports to the system, they will be punished instead in whatever way Riot does.

You were \"toxic\". Riot 2.0's new buzzword. Riot 2.0 wants to bring in as many casual/new players as they can, because their original players are losing interest in the game, FAST. This means they can see right through the moneymaking ploys Riot use. New players = more money.They are a company first, their #1 goal is money.\n\n2. I personally don't think it should be punishable with suspensions, given a player can mute you and you literally have no chance of offending them anymore. Maybe if Riot 2.0 remembered and encouraged muting over reporting, they would actually achieve something. However, it is their shitty system and as long as you play their game, you must abide by their rules. \n\n3. Think of every other player as the 'stereotypical Tumblr SJW', who can and will be offended by everything. Just don't talk. Literally. Just do not speak to them. Even though miscommunication should be punishable, Riot 2.0 doesn't care about the state of the game. They just want to remove the toxic reputation of the League community\n\n4. In the four years I have played, I honestly don't think I have ever met another summoner who could not have been reported at one stage or another throughout a game for one of their actions.
