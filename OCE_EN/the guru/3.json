There could simply be a compatibility issue. Have you tried running League in compatibility mode for Windows 7?\n\nFirstly, though, are you currently using any VPNs? If you are, try disabling them and then play a game. See if that works.\n\nIf it doesn't, one thing you should try is [changing your DNS to Google's Public one](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues#wq4). Make sure you remember your previous settings, as changing the DNS could have negative results for other applications (like data metering and whatnot). You'd want to be able to reset it at any time. Remember to flush your DNS and reset your computer for each change!\n\nAnother thing you can try is port forwarding. This is mostly to speed up a connection *slightly* and to open up its NAT. It's a bit hard if you haven't already attempted it, so if you can find a solution that doesn't involve port forwarding you're probably better off doing that. [Here's Riot's guide in case you want to get started by yourself](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues#wq7), though it fails to mention a few requirements and other things. You should ask me first if you'd like to attempt that.\n\nI guess that's all I can suggest for now. Best of luck!","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"godsmustbecrazy3","date":"2015-02-12T01:03:44.737+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Same old, I used to have this issue from time to time along with Firewall error.","replies":[{"poster":"The Guru","date":"2015-02-14T08:40:22.657+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"yeah its annoying, but riots support is just terribly bad, they never reply to any forums and don't have any good topics for fixes like this shiz","replies":[]}]}]}
