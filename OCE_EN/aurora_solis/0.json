During the holidays, I have been working on a piece that I submitted as one of the assessments for the course. A few people told me it reminded them of a video game OST - I immediately thought of the various music used in League of Legend&#039;s log-in screens and wished one day I would be able to compose something worthy enough to be featured on one. It has been a dream and goal of mine to have my creativity featured in passions I enjoy, specifically gaming - and I absolutely adore the various music composed for this game.    \r\n\r\nAs a little test, I chose a previous log-in screen and uploaded my music with it (as linked in this discussion). Feel free to listen, and I appreciate feedback. \r\n\r\nNote: (If you&#039;re not a fan of long build-ups, listen from 2:05).\r\n\r\n{{champion:37}} \r\n\r\nThanks!","replies":[{"poster":"Shashe","date":"2016-02-05T23:17:31.415+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Very nice","replies":[]},{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2016-02-05T09:58:55.868+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I can honestly say I enjoy this.
