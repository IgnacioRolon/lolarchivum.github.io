But here it is.\r\n\r\nHi Reddit, i dont want to take up too much of your time so i&#039;ll get right into it.\r\nCurrently, my health situation in real life is hard, its manageable for most people. But for me it&#039;s extremely hard. A possible out for me and my situation would be a medical procedure, the risks that come with this are, well, the title pretty much says it all. I know most of you would be thinking how stupid it is for me to even consider such a procedure with such risks, but for me and for personal reasons its a possibility.\r\nAlso i know you all are probably thinking with a situation like this, why im thinking about what im about to say; and honestly, i have no idea.\r\nI was just curious, that if things were to go downhill for me, what would happen to my account. If i was to request something e.g. I have spent thousands of dollars on my account dumping money into skins and such, would Riot be able to possibly transfer the skins on my account to a friends that i name? Or would i be able to donate/give my account away without any punishment being handed to my account or the person receiving it?\r\nJust genuinely curious if i can do anything with my account or will it just be dead? Any reply from a higher up or anyone with knowledge would be helpful.\r\nThanks~","replies":[{"poster":"Wuks","date":"2015-12-18T00:36:11.398+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey Crayola,\n\nI'm Wuks, one of the Wrenchmen from the North American Wrenchmen Program. First of all, I sincerely wish you the best. I hope that surgery goes better than expected and gets you back up with a speedy recovery. \n\nRegarding your question, as per the Terms of Use, your account is property of Riot Games and is non-transferrable to another player. Account sharing, purchasing, and selling are not allowed within the Terms of Use. However, in the worst case scenario that you provided, your account would effectively be unused. Now, you didn't hear this from me, but if anything, prepare a sheet or document with the credentials, security questions, and email associated with the account. If the account is ultimately terminated for a violation in the Terms of Use, then that's that. But it's not any different from your account not being used again. \n\nWith that being said, I'm not condoning any violations of the League of Legends Terms of Use; I'm just saying what could be done in your situation. Best of luck with your situation, and I'll keep you in my heart and on my mind.\n\nSincerely,\nWuks","replies":[]},{"poster":"A Flying Brick","date":"2015-12-17T22:58:48.799+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It's sad to hear about that, I hope things go well for you.\nBasically skins can't be transfered but you can include things like usernames and passwords in a will. Basically you write them down (clearly) and seal them and delcare in the will who gets what account. It sounds weird to do but it means someone can have your account after you die, or atleast deactivate it for you (in the case of things like fb).","replies":[]}]}
