Obviously people want to play this game mode.\r\n\r\nOf course Riot won't like to bring this out permanently because \"there isn't enough people playing it\", but lets me honest here. \r\nWho plays Teambuilder? What is so good about Teambuilder? Isn't it just Normal 5v5? What does Teambuilder even do? Sorry if i appear ignorant, but i honestly don't see how Teambuilder is different from queuing up for a Normal 5v5. If anyone does know, please enlighten me.","replies":[{"poster":"Ing√©nue","date":"2014-12-18T21:49:25.933+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I have been playing team builder quite a bit lately and finding a team and getting into game always happens within 5mins. There was a little hike in waiting times after new SR was implemented into all other game modes but it has since lessened, most likely due to people realising that in team builder there is no need to fight over roles and have afk threats before the game has even begun. \n\nWhen TT ranked came out accidentally it was a new thing and people wanted to try it out. If it were to become a permanent fixture, ques would probably take the same amount of time as team builder. Aside from this, I really want TT ranked but I don't want it to replace team builder.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Omega","date":"2014-12-18T07:52:46.501+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Team builder suffers from the same problem as ranked play, it takes too long to find a match, especially\nif you don't pick support lol.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Slim Chaedi","date":"2014-12-18T06:23:03.088+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I like both but would much prefer permanent Twisted Treeline as it offers a very different experience to Teambuilder. As soon as the team is built, it is normal Summoner's Rift all over again. In addition, Teambuilder might let you get whatever role you want, but Twisted Treeline has a much more relaxed meta anyway. You can generally play whoever you want on it, as long as your team comp isn't too weak.","replies":[]}]}
