Anyone else having this issue?","subforum":"Help & Support (OCE)","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey, \r\n\r\nIts been about 6 months since I have lost skillshot indicators. The blue bars show up when I hover over the abilities but not when I press the key for the ability. \r\n\r\nI have tried this for all my champions: Ezreal, Corki (ult), ashe (W) (ult), Mundo (Q), Morg (Q), Sivir(Q), Karthus (Wall), Jayce(Wall) etc\r\n\r\nThis has made it incredibly difficult to play a lot of champions I like. I have also tested this on multiple computers (Dell Laptop, 2 pcs) and the results are the same so I am assuming its more my user/configuration rather than the PC/graphics card.\r\n\r\nMy personal config is a bit different from others \r\nMy skills are setup to ASDF rather than QWER, mini map is on the right and all the UI elements are smaller than normal. Could this be the reason? \r\n\r\nAnyone else having this issue? \r\nS","replies":[{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2016-05-27T02:48:45.324+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The most likely reason is you are using quick cast without indicators. When you hit esc in game there is an option to set all your abilities/items individually to quick cast, by default quick cast does not show indicators and will cast the ability when you press down the key. \n\nIf you scroll down in that window where it shows quick cast (the little lightning bolts under the keys) there should be an option to the effect of \"turn on indicators when using quick cast\". What this means is that when you press down and hold the key you will see the skill indicator, and it will cast when you release the key, rather than as soon as you press it.\n\nI'm hoping this is what your problem is :) If it isn't or if you can't find the option let me know and I'll get you screenie or ping one of the wrenchmen for you.","replies":[]}]}
