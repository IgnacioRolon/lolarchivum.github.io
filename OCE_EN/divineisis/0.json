I happened to be put first pick for bans and whilist doing so I wanted to fix up my masteries this happened (shown in picture). It made me miss a ban and champion pick. I couldn&#039;t turn off the mastery editor or anything, nor could I let my team mates know what was happening. Sometimes I get the champion thing stuck on it&#039;s own and it doesn&#039;t want to go away, making me unable to communicate with the team. Though, if this happened in a ranked queue I wouldn&#039;t just have 5 - 15 min wait but also loose LP.

It might improve once Masteries and Runes are redone, but until then just avoid editing Masteries while in champion select. It's buggy.\n\nBug reports usually go [here](http://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/bug-report), by the way.\n\nAlso, your account being on EUNE. Have you tried changing region for the boards (top left) and then logging in there? Also, why are you on the OCE boards?","replies":[]}]}
