You have to be in the top x% of players playing whichever champion in whichever role (they treat annie mid and annie support differently for example).\n\nIn this particular case I can definitely see your CS being your biggest downfall, with you having 75 cs (which is what should be aiming for at 10 minutes) at the end of a 22 minute game.
