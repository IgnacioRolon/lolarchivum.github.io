As in when i press enter it goes down a line and nothing ever happens. Also it is run as administrator just so you know.\r\n\r\nWhen i run a ping test to that OCE IP address with cmd it says &quot;request timed out&quot; \r\n(ping test being this in cmd: &quot;Ping 103.240.227.5 -n 25 -l 500&quot;)\r\n\r\nMy issue is that up until a few days ago i had a playable ping of under 100 and now it is stuck at over 200 constantly. So i want to run a tracert so i can see where in the line there is an issue. but when i copy/paste this:      (tracert 103.240.227.5) &gt; &quot;%USERPROFILE%\\desktop\\Tracert.txt&quot;        into cmd it doesnt do anything. hence this post. \r\nI cant play league of legends with my current ping, and i dont know what to do. \r\nAny help would be Highly appreciated, Thanks.","replies":[{"poster":"SephirothSG","date":"2016-09-28T10:26:57.328+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey there,\n\nFirst off, the response you receive when you attempt to ping the OCE server IP's directly is intended, these servers do not respond to ICMP requests.\n\nCould you do the following for me;\n\n* [Download WinMTR](https://sourceforge.net/projects/winmtr/files/WinMTR-v092.zip/download) and run a traceroute to the following IP.
