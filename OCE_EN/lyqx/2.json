I've had the rare occurrence of being matched with someone who I'd been matches with a few days prior (and they always play differently) but it's certainly not common enough for an entirely new system to be implemented to affect how the matchmaking works to avoid matching you with specific individuals. If you truly want to avoid being matched with someone again you could try reporting the for \"unskilled player\" (this actually forces the system to check it's matching them with the right people) and hope that it wasn't just that they were having a bad game. Chances are that, by the time you do come across these people again (if ever), you'll have completely forgotten about them.","replies":[{"poster":"Lyqx","date":"2015-08-16T14:41:23.201+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Also, report for unskilled player only affects non ranked play.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Lyqx","date":"2015-08-12T12:49:10.247+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Like I said, I only encounter a few of them, roughly 3 to 5 for more than 2 times.
