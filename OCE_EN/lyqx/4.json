I waited about 3 minutes and then had to press the x at the top right. I rejoined in and I was not in a game and could proceed to que for another aram which worked correctly. (I think someone may not have clicked otherwise I would have had a 5 min wait for failing to load into the champ select screen idk). But yeah It seems a random bug or something. Idk. All i could see was black screen in the LoL client","replies":[]}]}
