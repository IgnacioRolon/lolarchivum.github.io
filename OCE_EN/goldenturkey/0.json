But what ails me greatly is how if playing Ranked and having someone dc for 10+ minutes to not being able to connect at all and going on to lose a 4v5 causes you to lose LP... Like seriously, Almost every second game i play in Silver has someone DC. Its not fun to play against a DC team and it sure as hell is not fun to play on the team that has the DC and to go on and lose LP. When I reached Bronze 1 a week back i hit 97 LP and following this I had 5 DC&#039;s in a row on my own team, sure one or two of them managed to reconnect and play but i ended up in bronze 2 almost bronze 3 before i finally started queuing with reliable premade groups.\n\nNow I know this probably isn&#039;t as common in high elo&#039;s but for those in bronze-gold maybe even platinum it is possibly the most frustrating thing about climbing the ranked ladder. I am not blaming those who play and dc, though i do believe you should always make sure your net will be reliable before playing. I also know of this new /remake system they are putting in place if there is a dc within the first 5 minutes but what i don&#039;t understand is why and how you can be penalized for someone on your team disconnecting in the more key and vital parts of the game such as the team fighting stages, you are essentially losing LP for something you cant do anything about.\n\nAll I want to know is why there isn&#039;t a system in place that if a team mate dc&#039;s for a duration of around 10+ minutes during a game then instead of losing hard sought LP you simply lose none and even then, losing half would be better than losing full LP. It amazes me how i can play a fun challenging game and lose causing 16 LP to be removed and that i can play a game with a DC on my team for the majority of the game and lose 18 LP (and yes i&#039;m speaking from recent experience.) Considering Leavebuster can ban you for it and send you pat on the back messages for not DCing I don&#039;t understand how you guys cant make it as aforementioned. You guys make Millions on a daily basis and i&#039;m absolutely certain it can be done and done to your customers benefit, So I ask you Riot; Why am I being punished for trying my hardest to win a 4v5 Ranked game I have next to no chance in winning?\n\n{{sticker:zombie-brand-mindblown}} \n\nThank you,\nA Concerned and frustrated Caffeine fueled fan.","replies":[{"poster":"Scratchmagooch","date":"2016-06-03T13:40:37.189+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I think its pretty ridiculous that you can be punished for someone Dcing on your own team.","replies":[]},{"poster":"ABlueQuaker","date":"2016-05-30T12:39:45.482+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"http://oce.leagueoflegends.com/en/news/game-updates/player-behavior/play-games-matter/remake\n\nAt least try to do your research.","replies":[{"poster":"DipperOCE","date":"2016-05-30T13:30:39.011+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Remake isn't doing jack shit especially right now it is currently just a surrender vote Mr. \"do your research\".

Even if you do have someone who disconnects before 3 minutes and there is no First Blood it's not going to fix the issue. The enemy team won't want to remake because it's an easy win = easy LP. What SHOULD happen is that if a team has someone who disconnects for more than 10-15 minutes (plenty of time to fix your computer) then if they lose they lose NO LP and the team who wins still gains their LP. It seems fair to me and not a total waste and people can't abuse the system because their account will just be flagged for continuously leaving games.","replies":[]}]}
