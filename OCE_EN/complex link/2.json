It's also not very effective to report people on the boards because chances are, not that many people (including Rioters) will see it.\n\nThe best thing you can do is send in a [support ticket](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/requests/new) directly to Riot about this guy. The best category to use is _I want to report abusive behavior, cheating, or a malicious link_.","replies":[]}]}
