Need to have a sense of humour and be able to take a lot of shit. \r\nWe don&#039;t like serious deadbeats who have no sense of humour or aren&#039;t chilled and take the game to seriously. \r\n\r\nWe win lots by having fun anyways. \r\n\r\nGold and under hmu on here or add my ign league. \r\nBig Chief Poon\r\n\r\nPref players that are flexible with all lanes. Cheers. Poon","replies":[]}
