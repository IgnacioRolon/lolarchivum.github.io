So i message riot and simply get told that my account was found to be using scripts or hacks. I have never once used any type of hack/script on any game let alone 1 that i havent played for nearly a year. In the same email im also told that the account will never be unbanned. So i have lost all the hours and more importantly  $$$$  spent on this game for riot to be unreasonable and not even listening to my reasoning.. do not spend any money on riot u are just a number and they dont care if u have a valid excuse.","replies":[{"poster":"muffd","date":"2015-03-31T08:11:21.397+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thats what i sent the email for it was rufused and the discussion was closed.
