Normally i just wait to get home and patch... Which sucks balls.\n\nAll you need to do is change your internet connection. A mates house or something like this. OR Delete your lol_air_client project folder located at: C:\\Riot Games\\League of Legends\\RADS\\projects\\lol_air_client\\  After you delete it you will need to patch again. Keep in mind that the client will download everything that was in that folder and it will be around 1 gig in Downloads. This folder also contains your custom item sets so make sure you set em up again if you were using any. ^.^ Good luck","replies":[{"poster":"HORSE OF FORCE","date":"2015-04-10T09:14:42.431+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Or you could just mark the folder as completely downloaded manually...","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"HORSE OF FORCE","date":"2015-03-20T09:28:45.376+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Sometimes, just closing the opening the patcher will fix that. I feel kinda silly when I go on a wild goose chase searching for a solution when all the patcher needed was to cache a few files.\n\nAfter you're certain that it's an issue, then you can try the following (try each method as the previous one fails, stop when you find a solution):\n1. Run the game in admin mode.\n2. Try another internet connection (only temporary, use following methods for permanent solutions)\n3. Change to Google's Public DNS.\n4. Repair your client.\n5. Update all drivers and the operating system itself.\n6. Defragment and scan your computer.\n\nIf you need help in doing any of the above methods, just ask!\n\nBest of luck.","replies":[]}]}
