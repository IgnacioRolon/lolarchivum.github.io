However, now I have been referred to Boards. So here it is.\r\n\r\nHi Riot my good friends,\r\n\r\nI have observed over the entirety of the Oceania server life span that there is not enough encouragement for fellow players on other servers to join the Oceania server.Please do not misunderstand me, I have absolutely enjoyed playing on the Oceania server with considerable less amount of ping which has allowed me as a player to learn the game well enough to have reached the top 15% in the server in Summoners Rift ranked Solo/Duo Queue.\r\n\r\nHowever, I have noticed a high demand of fellow summoners wanting Twisted Treeline ranked and other game modes such as Dominion. These demands have been met with a dignified disapproval because of the low population on the Oceania server.\r\n\r\nI believe I may have an ultimatum for this matter. Do we wait for the population to increase in size before releasing these queues, or do we release these queues so that players on other serves who live in the Oceania region will be encouraged to join the server. (Sort of like the age old question; which comes first, the chicken or the egg?)\r\n\r\nMy solution is to release ALL queues (Twisted Treeline normal, Twisted Treeline ranked and Dominion) for 2 complete weeks as a trial to see if there was a high increase in population. From there, you can determine whether releasing these servers will dramatically increase the population of the servers to keep the queue's released. If there was not a major increase in population, the queues should be withdrawn until there is.\r\n\r\nThis trial is an effective way to know whether keeping these queue's will increase the population or not.\r\n\r\n\r\nTldr: Do a 2 week trial of ranked 3v3 and all other queue types that NA has to determine whether the population on Oceania will grow rapidly if these queue's are released permanently.","replies":[{"poster":"Rezink","date":"2014-12-19T03:34:49.266+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Lol, you guys might not remember me but I got a Riot response for this exact topic a month or two ago roughly. \n\nIts funny, I dont play LoL anymore & I am only checking these forums because I have looked at every other website I frequent & there is still 25 mins of the day left before I can head home. What are the chances I come accross this thread haha.\n\nThey basically said no, we're not looking to expand the queue times.\n\nSo what does this mean? The people like me who are sick of unorganised SR gameplay stop playing and find other game to enjoy *(Play some CSGO if yr sick of LoL, thats what I have been playing lately & its a breath of fresh air)* I still think LoL is a great game but once you start getting sick of it or over the game whats left?\n\nWell if my account was still on the NA server I could play TT or Dom.\n\nDo you have two good friends who want to start a team? Well..... you can't play TT because its never up. \n\nAnyway give up OP they don't listen to the players suggestion for good or bad reasons I dont know but I do know were not getting TT ranked anytime this year, maybe in 2016 after their playerbase starts moving on.\n\nLoL is such a big game though so who knows, but the quick SR queues don't help me because I dont play the queue anymore lol.\n\nHave fun guys checkout some CSGO, its pretty fun and you can 1v5 carry if yr an average player like me :)","replies":[]},{"poster":"GoldenTomat0","date":"2014-12-18T22:07:21.332+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"releasing something for 2 weeks isn't a valid way to see if it's viable though. because people don't have it normally, lots of people will play it whilst they can.\n\nI want it to happen though, 3's is fun.","replies":[]},{"poster":"TrashDonnut","date":"2014-12-18T21:15:25.684+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I really doubt they will.\n\nChances are lower than 5%.","replies":[]},{"poster":"MadLifeJunior","date":"2014-12-18T21:10:24.384+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"In addition to the trial idea I think Riot should host a poll that allows the Oceanic community to vote for what game mode,twisted tree line in this instance they want available.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Dolmio Grin","date":"2014-12-18T20:40:32.398+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"They really should trial this. Almost everyone I know that plays League (myself included) are getting really sick of only having 5v5 ranked/normal and ARAM available. I mainly stick to ranked, but every now and then, when I'm on tilt or am just too tired to risk a ranked game, 3v3 with a couple of mates would be fun.","replies":[]}]}
