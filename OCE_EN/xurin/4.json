Can we have this done in game as well? The green dot that indicates when an ally has their ultimate up is useful, however knowing the exact cooldown of it would be far more helpful, particularly if there is a player who is chat banned or speaks another language and can't inform the team when their ultimate is available. Also, like in the spectator mode, adding summoner spells alongside the ult timer would help majorly for the same reasons.","replies":[{"poster":"Hyphen","date":"2014-12-23T00:13:10.854+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yes.","replies":[]},{"poster":"XURiN","date":"2014-12-22T12:04:47.616+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"thoughts?","replies":[]}]}
