It states this person is in a low priority queue and will not begin searching before the 10 minute timer is up.\n\nFYI if someone closes this window the timer restarts at 10 minutes again not like the dodge timer that continues to tick down after closing of the popup window.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"xXODINXx","date":"2015-12-08T05:24:13.182+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"they should not give prior queues for co-op vs ai games the enemy team is not even real.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Child","date":"2014-12-26T09:39:26.401+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"which is ironic because u most probably did","replies":[]}]}
