Whether that's to influence the gameplay, such as taking advantage of an exploit, or changing some of the visual aspects of the game, such as replacing splash art, map art, adding custom champion skins etc. then that is something that can, and probably will, get you banned.\n\nIf all it does is access information available through the API, chances are you'd be fine. That kind of information is already available through services such as op.gg, lolking, mobafire and the like, so, as Nightjar has already stated, Riot doesn't consider it an unfair advantage.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Nightjar","date":"2017-09-11T23:44:47.312+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"not really bannable, alot of people use it or it's competitors and riot's stance on it, is if you could access the information from something like op.gg, then it's not an unfair advantage.\n\nHowever riot's stance on every external program is, it might be allowed, it might follow riot's rules and be fair, but if they accidentally ban you for it, well sucks to be you.\n\nI'd say it's overall safe though.","replies":[]}]}
