Why do you run away from insults? When someone INSULTS you, stay and reason with them. If the conversation become unreasonable, then let them have it; Tell them how you feel about their approach. \n\nWhat does running away with your tail behind your leg solve? It only demonstrate you're too timid to stand up for yourself. You can forget about getting a pay raise, if that is how timid you are. Not to mention every other aspects of life when conflict arises.","replies":[{"poster":"Astara","date":"2018-12-22T05:58:35.825+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"That is, honestly, horrible advice. You don't have to listen to utter bullshit insults NOR do you have to descend to that level and \"let them have it\" in order to not be weak or timid. In a lot of eyes, that kind of behavior shows that you ARE weak. If someone is being that rude and just insulting over and over with literally no benefit, like the OP says, you simply mute it and never play with that person again. Reasoning with him is fine, but if it doesn't work within a minute IMHO, just move on. That guy was simply childish and needs to learn that being a dick for no reason WILL lose him more games AND drive away literally anyone who wants to play with him.","replies":[{"poster":"TheDemonEmperor","date":"2018-12-22T06:33:07.673+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> invited by a** friend**\n\nThat was his friend. The guy just got excluded from the circle because he quit after some quarrel. That is not how you handle the situation. Like i said, reason with them about the circumstance and see how things go from there. If the other person has nothing but prejudiced statements, then let them know they are not being fair.\n\nThose who ran away, a majority of them feel, anger, sadness and IT EAT AWAY AT THEM; Because THEY DIDNT SAY ANYTHING when THEY HAD A CHANCE. Do you want to bottle all that negative emotions up inside? Easier said then done. Later when the realisation of how disrespected and shamefully they've treated you kicked in, all that left is chaos within your very soul. And i'll bet you will run simulations in your head how you could've done it better, and most of it will be hate vs hate.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"YukiHikado","date":"2018-12-22T02:20:55.479+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I did message them but they  acted all defensive and just couldn't or wouldn't say anything to me that could answer my question so they just left","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Astara","date":"2018-12-21T13:20:21.640+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"That person was clearly being childish, but you also shouldn't leave a game.
