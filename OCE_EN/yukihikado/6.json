Can't deny you that intellectual response, very rare from anyone I have debated with.\n\nThe 3 different factors in this situation are:\nResponsibility\nPotential\nImpact\n\nLeague is a 5v5 game so each player on each team has an equal responsibility to their team.\n\nResponsibility is the key factor in determining accuracy. It is how much you are apart of your team unconditionally.\n\nIn this game you are 20% responsible in your team.\n\nPotential is how much you are limited by the game. Pretty self explanatory but needs to be factored in to be clearly separated from impact.\n\nPercentage wise this will always be 100%.\n\nPotential being the constant in the equation is what allows responsibility to be the key factor in accuracy. it doesn't work with impact in the equation as it is an unknown variable.\n\nImpact is the end result produced by your performance.\n\nIn this game there is negative gearing to factor in so your impact can be anywhere from 100% to -100%\n\nBoth teams trying to lose the game would be just as much of a struggle as both teams trying to win.\n\nYou cannot factor in impact into the equation for accuracy because it is an unknown variable. People often say that you are the only constant. This is false, there will always be 5 players designated to each team, even though the players might change from game to game, there will always be 5 of them on each team. This makes the number of players on your team a constant, which means you are not the only constant, which means that all the constants have to be factored into the equation for accuracy.\n\n> * 3rd, You are assuming everyone is EQUAL in term of skills and abilities.

Dont think that it is flawed; Think! that you lacks the comprehension to the words instead. This is a marker of intelligence.\n\nAm done \"Casting pearls before swine\" talking to you, let others be the judge of your \"wisdom\".","replies":[]},{"poster":"Transcender","date":"2018-08-06T10:41:01.487+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You are trying to tell me that 1 + 1 = 3 and that is all the evidence you need against me while I am literally showing you how 1 + 1 = 2. Your argument is that I am wrong because I think that 1 + 1 = 2 and not 3.\n\nCan you see the problem with that? You need to show me why 1 + 1 = 3 before we can even begin to discuss it.\n\nPlease re-read my responses until you actually understand them and then reply to them when you believe you cannot understand them any better, and if you are struggling, feel free to ask and I can try to clarify further. As you have stated, all you are doing is trying to break through my shell. You have yet to put down your feather duster and listen.\n\nUntil someone can bring forth the actual mathematical equation that can showcase how they think the ranked system works. Everything you say has no value to me. You can yell at me all you want, it will not make me think you know what you are talking about.\n\nYour \"quote\" is logically flawed in so many ways, the answer is what it is, whether I have it or not, it could fall into my lap or be light years out in the universe, it is not always in the places we don't want to look it could be anywhere, which I why I look everywhere even when I think I have already found it, that is how I progress. You are using analogies that do not match the scenario. You are telling me that ranked is not in your control. You claim that mathematics is too limited to be used to make calculations in a game, that is played on a computer, you know, that thing that literally uses 1's and 0's as it's base language. You are telling me that accuracy of rank is not a fixed value.\n\nYou need to start making a point and have something behind it.\n\nLet's replace the word \"potential\" with \"limit\" because words can end up being used too loosely and lose their exact meaning over time.\n\nLet me also clarify this:\n\nAfter an infinite number of games, you will still be 1 out of the 5 players on your team in EVERY SINGLE GAME.","replies":[]},{"poster":"TheDemonEmperor","date":"2018-08-06T09:57:56.838+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> one. This is a simple process of thinking it through logically using the information that is already known. Everything anyone says is an opinion. Facts are not facts because they are presented, they are always there regardless of perspective or argument.\n\nThis is not a simple process. The data collection is amass from many servers, and from thousands of players. The data analysts then study the trends and modify the structures as they see fit. \n\nYou have no large scale samples to collects and process from. The data for your ideology come from you, and a HANDFUL of people that you know. That is not enough knowledge for you or anyone to claim that they can refine the system. How agrogant is this?\n\nThis is akin to someone with no exprience and no academic background in data analyse. Telling people to trust their statement. The data analysts working for riot are NOT DUMB AS.SES. Believe it or not they have a degree and the hiring process is a long and enduring one.\n\n> two. The point of using the infinite scenario is to show that the number of games is irrelevant.\n\nNo man, it just demonstrated that; By using a unrealistic duration. You can say whatever you want. You dont even considered the possibilities of exprience's gain and improvement over time.\n\n> League is a 5v5 game so each player on each team has an equal responsibility to their team.\n\nIf you are better than your current rank, you can carry your team mate. This is fact. There are imperical evidences to back up my statement. Boosters, or boosting websites. Pros stream unrank or bronze to challenger. ECT.\n\n> Responsibility is the key factor in determining accuracy. It is how much you are apart of your team unconditionally.\n\nResponsibility is Not a factor in determining ACCURACY. Consistency is the FACTOR. A PERSON CANT BE CALLED ACCURATE. IF THEY CAN ONLY HIT THE MARK SOMETIMES. He need to DO SO consistently.\n\n>Potential is how much you are limited by the game. Pretty self explanatory but needs to be factored in to be clearly separated from impact.\n\nNO!!!! POTENTIAL is your abilities that have yet to reveal itself. And can turn the tide of the game if you are able to unlock it.\n\nWho says, my potential limit me!? You are the 1st.\n\n\n> four. Quote me on the specific sentence that gave you that false impression so I can learn to present it more accurately.\n_\n\"Responsibility of outcome is all that matters, and in a team game **everyone is equally responsible** (20% in this 5v5 game).\"_\n_\"In this game you are** 20% responsible in your team**.\"_\n\n>five. You implied that the functions that league of legends has are not simply more mathematical equations added on. I am not sure if you understood my initial response. Feel free to clarify.\n\nYes, i've clarified that this game needs more than the ability to do basic math; Inorder to drag health bars from 100-0. Your initial's respond was a poor used of sophistry; Which implies, math is the limit, if i cant go pass it, others cant aswell. \n\nThey might be smarter than you.\n\n>six. Being the MVP doesn't guarantee a victory though, and being the worst doesn't guarantee a loss. Regardless of number of games, you are not the sole reason for the outcome so it doesn't matter if you are climbing or dropping in that situation, that is the problem.\n\nBeing MVP mean you have A HIGHER CHANCE at winning games. The worst players have a terrible chance to progress. \n\nExample, promotion in the work place. The better you are, the higher chance you'll have at catching upper management's eyes and be in their good book. The opposite can be said for those that can not perform up to standards. They'll have the highest chance to be fired.\n\nAm sure you can relate to this at your work place.\n\n>seven. Yet I can't convince some people that I am not a smurf. That is when I am duoing with my \"bronze\" support who mains top lane.\n\n> Ill accept something when the \"evidence\" used against me isn't flawed. Until then I seem to \"conveniently\" be able to logically justify everything surrounding the situation of myself and everyone else in this game.\n\nTranscender. Here is a qoute from \"Carl Jung\" Infilth it will be found. It mean, What you want to find, is at a place where you least want to look. This relate to you in many ways. Once you've find and embrace the answer, the current you will be reborn a new.\n\n> On top of that **I have the answer to solve the majority of the problems in the game** but **people would rather have 20% accuracy rather than the potential 80%**+ accuracy of a solo performance indicator.\n\nAm at a point where i am unable to break through your shell. Years after years, you've carried this attitude that you can be at the top, and your ideas is profound. I dont even think you have a degree. Let alone the credential to improve a complex system.\n\nLooks at the highlighted texts...Jesus, mother of christ. **READ **that overflowing Arrogant. This is a guy that have no experience in the analytical field. Not only he is saying he has **VAST **solutions. BUT He can raised accuracy to 80%.
