Like to be pretty fair and honest you get people treating it like a normal more than a actual ranked game. Like I know flex is a lower ranking mode. But I feel like a lot people dont take the mode seriously .","replies":[{"poster":"TTL Rem","date":"2018-08-25T20:57:33.719+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'm one of the ones who *do* take it seriously.\n\nUnfortunately, I had my placements ruined by people who don't. On multiple occasions I had Diamonds troll and run it down for no reason other than \"It's Flex Queue\". And because Riot cares more about money than their players, nothing will happen to them...\n\nNeedless to say, players like that have ruined the game for me.","replies":[{"poster":"YukiHikado","date":"2018-08-25T22:28:55.149+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I won one of my flex game a couple days ago. But when I looked at the enemy team 3 of them were junglers and  were mucking around. Trolling they said. And when our team wasn't that good they started saying that they will try cause they said our team was bad and shit. But in the end they lost. Only one of them on there team was not a troll","replies":[]}]}]}
