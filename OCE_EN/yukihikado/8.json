Personally I haven't had many issues with matchmaking. It's based on MMR not rank, and someone being a lower or higher rank than you doesn't necessarily mean they are all that far from you skill wise. Not to say I haven't had any, but usually that's a result of smurfing or the like, and I'm also aware that the matchmaking quality differs greatly in certain brackets.\n\n2. It should actually help with this. Assuming they keep the new account average rank as low silver those players will effectively be placed at a lower rank now. Time will tell for sure on that one though.\n\n3. Should also help with this, though how much remains to be seen. The idea of the new ranks and reducing the divs to 4 is to consolidate the players in each rank so that there isn't so much of a gap between the lowest and highest div. Theoretically this means the bottom divs won't be so outlier-y. There will still be those players that are just below a rank and push till they essentially luck through their promos then stay there, but they don't exactly play frequently.","replies":[{"poster":"Bookbash","date":"2018-09-24T04:13:07.796+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"1. Classic matchmaking is based on mmr, but then you have a case where a much higher elo player is playing in a role that carries the game compared to one that doesn't (e.g. support). It's just unbalanced. I'm hoping that the role rankings will fix that, IF they incorporate it into matchmaking. And sometimes OCE late at night has atrocious matchmaking, especially at the top of the ladder. Challengers vs Platinums, etc. Or a platinum game with each side having a challenger, but one side's challenger is the support, and the other's is the jungler, GG.\n\n2. Let's hope it helps. Just finished a game where an enemy Vlad (silver 3) played like a robot. Turns out they are a new player to the game with a 39% win ratio in ranks and it's their first season. That's unfair on him, and also on us. Stomping noobs doesn't feel good, and I'm sure they don't like it either. Not to mention the enemy team will be totally frustrated. Btw the rest of us were in Bronze 1 / Silver 5.\n\n3. I doubt whether this will change at all. The fourth division will still be a mile away from the others. It will possibly change in the **short term**. This is because of the usual boosting and players not giving a damn because they know they cannot drop in the next game, etc etc, the usual reasons why the bottom of the barrel will congregate in these divisions.","replies":[{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2018-09-24T05:51:10.702+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I suppose time will tell. I think the combination of these changes and the position ranks (which will affect MMR afaik) I think things will significantly improve, and the matchmaking hiccups that exist will mostly be mitigated (low population hot spots will obviously still have issues, but hopefully less so).\n\nWe'll just have to wait and see :)","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"YukiHikado","date":"2018-09-23T10:06:25.097+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I Feel like riot wants people to suffer in a way , like I think people in a higher rank are gonna feel what the lower ranks have felt for the next season.

Iron took over because of it's accessibility (for an iron tool you just need iron, for bronze you need copper and tin which were rarely found in the same place and often trade reliant) and later the ability to alloy iron into steel, which *is* far superior. \n\nSo Iron isn't really better at all on it's own, but it did succeed Bronze for tools and weapons (etc.) through history. Meanwhile Bronze persisted in decoration and art, and is generally considered a prettier metal, so there is also an argument for Bronze being better, especially when used explicitly for a decoration.","replies":[]},{"poster":"BarryButcher","date":"2018-09-20T11:07:59.984+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Iron 4. There will only be 4 divisions per rank.\n\nThe people in Iron will be the people who are currently in Low and Mid Bronze. People In high Bronze and Low silver will be Bronze next season. If you look at how many people are in the divisions, my guess is Riot are trying to \"thin out\" Silver, since right now almost 50% of players are in Silver.\n\nSo being Iron wont be \"worse\" than Bronze, it will simply be the same people just with a new name. People in Low Silver will be the \"new Bronze\".\n\nhttps://i.imgur.com/AmCFvEK.png","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"CNFAAGFKU","date":"2018-09-20T13:52:55.650+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"People supposed to belong in brozne will finally have peace there","replies":[]},{"poster":"BarryButcher","date":"2018-09-20T09:28:09.181+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Bronze may actually get a border next season.\n\nRiot don't give the lowest rank a border because technically you didn't \"earn\" anything.
