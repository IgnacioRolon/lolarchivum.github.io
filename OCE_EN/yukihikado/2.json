If you like them enough to be willing to pay the price Riot ask, then yes, they are worth that to you.\n\nThe skins cost 1350 each. So 8100 RP for the lot.\n\nThe \"special edition\" skins cost 2240 each, so 13,440 total. Which means if you buy the bundle you're basically just getting a free gemstone.\n\nYou would be paying 6,340 RP roughly $55 for the loading screen borders and icons. Considering icons usually cost 250 RP ea, all 6 would be 1500, so you are paying 4840 for the loading screen borders. 806 RP ($7) per border.\n\nFor the price of these 6 \"special\" skins, you could buy all 4 (real) Ultimate skins for 13,000 RP. Which would you prefer?\n\nI mean if you're genuinely a SSG fan then having their signature and stuff on your skin would be cool otherwise i'd just get the base skins.","replies":[{"poster":"YukiHikado","date":"2018-07-23T21:25:36.006+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yeah I guess it all comes down to if your a fan or not of SSG , I guess having them would be cool","replies":[]}]}]}
