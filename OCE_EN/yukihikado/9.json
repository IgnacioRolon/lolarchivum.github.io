Like I am LVL 191 and wanting to know do the rewards get better or are you going to be stuck with Champion Shards each time you level up. Just kinda pointless when you own every champion. \n\nAnd If someone manages to get infinity  lvl what do they get ? \n\nJust wondering if anyone has thought about it ","replies":[{"poster":"Gehirn","date":"2018-09-10T02:02:51.932+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"You get a Gemstone every 50 levels starting at level 150, and you continue to get new profile icon borders and emotes every 25 levels until level 500, with Gemstones as the only unique reward after that.\nYou continue to get regular and Glorious Champion Capsules, and the BE from that you can put towards the essence emporiums (which come about twice a year) and buy all the chromas when they go up for BE. And of course there's BE for champ mastery emotes if you don't have a shard, insta-buying any new champions released, certain summoner icons, and rune pages, summoner name changes. I think that's all the BE options for now.\n\nThis is based on info in the [LoL wiki](http://leagueoflegends.wikia.com/wiki/Experience_(summoner)#Leveling_up).","replies":[{"poster":"YukiHikado","date":"2018-09-10T06:26:42.014+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yeah I see it last question when riot said infinity is that lvl 999 or 9999 just wondering what infinity goes up to","replies":[{"poster":"Gehirn","date":"2018-09-10T07:30:05.455+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'm not sure there even is a level cap, there are already two players in EUW above level 1000.
