I recently moved house and set up a new ADSL2+ connection with TPG. While in game I keep getting this \"attempting to reconnect\" issue which occurs about 5 minutes into a game. This issue will last about 10 seconds until it manages to re-establish the connection &ndash; at which point I am most likely dead. This continues during the whole game, in which I could disconnect up to 5 or 6 times. &ndash; Extremely Frustrating!\n\nI have had TPG techs come over to the house to run checks on the line etc, and they keep telling me there is no issue. I have been doing some of my own research on this, and I can see a couple of threads going back a year or so with TPG users experiencing this problem. Has it just not been fixed yet??\n\nOut of curiosity I wanted to see what my connection was doing while the the game &ldquo;attempts to reconnect&rdquo; ..so I ran a ping to google.com indefinitely. I load up a game of league and soon after I get the &ldquo;attempting to reconnect&rdquo;. I alt tab out of the game to see what the ping is doing and it times out for the exact same time league is trying re-establish connection.\n\nI need to determine if this is a league problem or what is going on? I am running a wired connection and am located in VIC.\n\nHelp please guys :(\n\nPS guys -  I can play fine over my 4G phone connection I have with Optus.","replies":[{"poster":"HORSE OF FORCE","date":"2015-06-10T07:54:31.965+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It might be TPG's DNS playing up again.
