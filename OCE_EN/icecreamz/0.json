Inside Zaun, there is a vision. A vision to turn this broken city into a paradise, to push through the pollution and see the bright lights emitted from stars, this is, a future Ekko continues to pursue.\r\n\r\nWalking through these streets, he doesn&rsquo;t see filth and unjust, he sees a beautiful city filled with opportunities, ...a home for him and all of the hard-working people that continue to survive and believe. Faintly, Ekko hears cries for help, that&rsquo;s no surprise he tells himself. Swiftly, he rushes to the scene, past run-down buildings, across the steaming atmosphere to a young orphan boy who is shoved against the cracked wall.\r\n\r\n&ldquo;Where is he?!&rdquo; the tall figure yelled at the struggling boy, who attempted to free himself and hopeful survive another day. \r\n\r\n&ldquo;I ddon&rsquo;t k-know&hellip; I swea-ar! Please&hellip; let me go&rdquo;\r\n\r\nEkko reveals himself, shining across the darkened alleyway with his glowing hair, beaming soullessly at the criminal with immense disgust. &ldquo;Looking for me?&rdquo; he rhetorically asks. As soon as Ekko saw this&hellip; Zaunite, he began to realise that this man&hellip; was not your typically augmentedly enhanced criminal (if you could say that). The man wore a large, black coat that covered his entire body, besides his severely scarred face and hands. Ekko knew he possessed something different. Something extremely dangerous, yet fragile... A Dark Star. \r\n\r\nIn the blink of an eye, the man had vanished. And appeared behind him, wrapping his claw-like hands around Ekko&rsquo;s neck. Though, Ekko quickly clicked his fingers and a magnificent fluffy, luminous creature appeared from his pocket and held its breath, turning extremely scarlet, and exploded - collapsing everything into a bright white light. Pieces of reality began to form together like puzzle pieces and the two of them appeared back in time, a few seconds earlier perhaps.  \r\n\r\n&ldquo;Thanks Zero&rdquo; Ekko said as he threw a glittering poro snack into the mysterious figure&rsquo;s tiny mouth. &ldquo;That was close, phew&rdquo; \r\n\r\nEkko looked up. The scaley man was panting hard, looking terrified. &ldquo;Your&hellip; one of them!&rdquo; \r\nThe poor orphaned boy gasped with cheer, shouting &ldquo;A&hellip; STAR GUARDIAN&rdquo;\r\n\r\n&ldquo;What&hellip; you weren&rsquo;t looking so scared a few seconds ago?&rdquo; Remarked Ekko disdainfully.\r\n\r\nSeconds later, the man started charging at him, enraged with dark powers fading his entire body in dark shades of black and purple, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll kill you! All of you filthy Star Guardians!&rdquo; he spat angrily.\r\n\r\nEkko turned to his companion, Zero, who fluttered excitedly above the cracked, rigid floor &ldquo;You ready? Let&rsquo;s do it&rdquo; \r\nHe chucked the creature into the cloudy sky, past the pollutive skyline, its wings golden in the sunlight, emitting a shiny light towards the Alley, creating a sort of&hellip; parallel galactic convergence, stunning the man right then and there.  \r\n\r\nHe threw his starwinder, but the man had yet again escaped once more and teleported behind him again. Ekko knew what to do. Immediately, he clicked his fingers, dived across the alley and appeared before the man, slamming him straight to the cold, dusty floor. \r\n\r\nMoments later, the zaunite quickly, again, stood on his feet. Panting vigorously, he yelled his fair share of swears as he revealed his darkened sphere from his ripped cloth. It gave a dark, isolating aura as it rotated in the man&rsquo;s great, large shaky hands&hellip; he gazed upon the spear and muttered something under his breath. \r\n\r\nHe then held the sphere high and smashed it down onto the concrete floor. Every small piece of the orb shattered across the alley. Out of these jagged pieces formed a enormous black hole. Everything from the rubbish on the floor, to the windows on the building began to slowly move towards the black hole. The orphaned boy took cover behind the corner of the street, scared out of this world. \r\n\r\n&ldquo;You and I are both dead&rdquo; snapped the Zaunite. &ldquo;But&hellip; it was worth it! To kill a Guardian of the Stars. It&rsquo;s a shame, you could&rsquo;ve joined us, The Dark Stars&rdquo; The man&rsquo;s voice was now dying, it felt as if something was missing from him, his soul had presumably vanished, he is not himself, or perhaps, he never was. \r\n\r\nThe portal continued to suck everything from existence as Ekko thought of a plan. He needed one desparetely.\r\n  \r\n\r\n&ldquo;Now. Meet your end Ekko, this is over, none of your s-second chances can save you from the p-po-powers of the Dark Stars!&rdquo; \r\nBoth Ekko and the man began to circle each other, thinking their next move. But the man was right, time was precious, soon it would be all over... \r\n\r\nThe man grinned. He stared at Ekko&rsquo;s face. &ldquo;You see, this here&hellip; is just no regular black hole, it is a Dark Star Void, and in it, you can&rsquo;t use your fancy powers! You can&rsquo;t go back in time anymore! Ha!&rdquo; His evil laugh echoed across the empty, elusive alleyway. \r\n\r\nIt was true. Ekko couldn&rsquo;t use his Z-drive, him and Zero we&rsquo;re only dimly glowing against the opening of the Dark Star Void. He felt chills go down his spine. He felt... his dreams fading away but it was not over. He could do this. He is a Star Guardian for a reason. To protect those who fear the criminals, without him&hellip; who else could there be? This city needs him. \r\n\r\nSuddenly, the Zaunite tackled Ekko, shoving him into the opening of the void. He heard distant screams of help from thousands who were trapped before him. &ldquo;After all these years&hellip; I&rsquo;ve finally killed one!&rdquo; screamed the man excitedly like a child in his birthday party. &ldquo;Yes-ye-w-wait-wh...w-why are you... smiling!??! What&rsquo;s wrong!?&rdquo;\r\n\r\n&ldquo;Why don&rsquo;t you look besides you? Huh?&rdquo; confidently replied Ekko, \r\nThe man switched his eyes to his left, besides him, was a glowing, transparent hologram that shows thousands of stars gleaming within it. &ldquo;Wh-WHAT?!&rdquo; confusingly yelled the cloaked man, there was panic in his voice, his excitement had long gone. &ldquo;N-NO! THIS CAN&rsquo;T BE!&rdquo; \r\n\r\n*Click* . \r\nZero made a small squeal after Ekko had clicked his fingers and everything once more, collapsed into an even more brighter light, leaving the Dark Star Void as if it was just a measly shadow.  \r\n\r\nA few minutes later, Ekko opened his eyes and he was on the stinking, decaying alley once more. &ldquo;Ugh&hellip;&rdquo; sighed Ekko as he patted Zero&rsquo;s soft body. &ldquo;Thought my Chronobreak would&rsquo;ve at least made this place smell pleasant, huh Zero?&rdquo; \r\nThere was a clank of rubble, through this debri appeared the figure of a man lying down, breathing slowly. He is completely vulnerable, extremely weak, he shattered something that kept him alive, something that promised him immense power, his Dark Star. Ekko sensed that the Zaunite had little time in this world left.  \r\n\r\n&ldquo;C&rsquo;mon, let&rsquo;s get you home&rdquo; Ekko told the poor orphan boy as he ruffled his hair. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re a hero! Cool!&rdquo; gasped the boy eagerly. \r\n\r\nThe scarred man held is breath and with his remaining strength, whispered &ldquo;W-Why did you-h-how did you&hellip;?&rdquo; \r\n\r\n&ldquo;Listen. I&rsquo;ve never wanted to be apart of something. Be someone&rsquo;s sidekick. But, If it means protecting something you love&hellip; something you cherish li-like this city for example, it is worth: All the time in the universe.&rdquo; \r\n\r\n&ldquo;I will never stop, I will make Zaun a shining city, beaming with hope. I will stop people. People like you, who don&rsquo;t share my vision, who want to destroy it. Because, \r\nI am the boy who shatters time ...and walks across galaxies for this city, for all of the good, hard-working people who fear the criminals and corruption of Zaun. I am: Star Guardian Ekko.&rdquo; \r\n\r\nAnd with those last words, Ekko, or Star Guardian Ekko, walked away from the, now-completely-broken alleyway, continuing his dream, his vision, through the corrupted streets of Zaun, with his companion Zero and another lonely orphaned boy to share this dream with&hellip;","replies":[]}
