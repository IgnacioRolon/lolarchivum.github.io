But obviously that's not always realistic and pretty hard sometimes. She can get f'd pretty easily though with CC and (if she isn't to fed)  build some defensive items (which most people don't.) If she did get nerfed though she would be garbage and no one would pick her.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Knuuckles","date":"2016-07-21T04:56:55.680+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Her late game is pretty trash and only scales well into mid if ahead, just safe pick against her and don't try to trade","replies":[]}]}
