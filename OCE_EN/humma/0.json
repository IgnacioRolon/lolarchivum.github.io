This game seems to bring out the worst in people at the moment and I&#039;m tired of wasting my valuable and increasingly limited time and life on a game I just don&#039;t enjoy anymore because of the people I find my self playing with.\r\n\r\nI don&#039;t care if we lose a CLOSE AND FUN game. \r\n\r\nI care when we lose because someone is clearly trolling. I was playing my last game with a Wukong on a score of 29/9/5 and a Vayne on 3/13/14. The Wukong CLEARLY had skill getting first blood and rolling from there. I was going to gank as the jungler but he said no. Something wasn&#039;t right. After mid game when team fighting generally starts, he and Vayne started to refuse to group. \r\n\r\nSuffice to say, the enemy team who were extremely behind and all chatting hate at each, proceeded to win the game while these two idiots screwed around tanking the game on 3 people who wanted to play and win. The fact they went to such an extreme length of time by winning in the first 20 minutes and then blowing it slowly in the last 20 (while constantly calling surrender) is a great annoyance to me and has made me question why I bother playing anymore. It wasn&#039;t enough to just feed or yell, they had to make winning a clear possibility and then take it away.\r\n\r\nI think because I have slowly been limited my LoL time I&#039;m noticing how much more common such frustrating game as these are becoming. Before I would have a good experiences to balance out the bad they just seem to not be happening any more. The game before last, my team had the clear advantage but no one wanted to group and finish. Two players got caught out and then the stacking enemy Nasus destroyed our base. \r\n\r\nI wouldn&#039;t care so much about winning, but ranked is ranked. You are there to progress and develop into a better player right? I just don&#039;t enjoy the experience anymore when I set out 40 minutes to an hour for some serious playing and others don&#039;t match it. Don&#039;t play ranked is you aren&#039;t going to take it seriously. Don&#039;t play ranked if you aren&#039;t willing to accept you might lose lane and have to play on with 100% commitment and effort. 4 other players are counting on you and some of them might only get an hour a day, maybe a week to play. You waste that time for them when you screw around in ranked where most people I hope expect a certain higher level of play. \r\n\r\nI don&#039;t pretend to expect Riot will catch EVERY troll in EVERY game. I feel like lately I&#039;m reporting someone for something every second game or so but I&#039;m not getting any feedback from Riot. I hope they continue to crack down on idiots that ruin this fun and continually evolving game for others.\r\n\r\nMy life is about to get busier than it has ever been before. I wont have as much time as I use to. Maybe I will just stick to normal games from now on or maybe I wont bother at all. I reached albeit a small goal of mine last season reaching Silver. Perhaps that&#039;s a sign I should just leave it there for now? \r\n\r\nEither way. Please be kind to others as you play this game. It&#039;s not that hard right?","replies":[{"poster":"trolledallmylife","date":"2017-05-11T17:26:30.027+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":2,"body":"News flash, Riot hasn't cared for 5 years!

Please be kind to others as you play this game. It's not that hard right?\n\n\nThis. \n\nOl' time gamer back after a 5-6 years break and I too need to rant. \n\nI started playing LoL this month and make mistakes because hell, I'm new! Despite my fairly functionnal brain, decent LoL knowledge and common sense, I make mistakes. \n\nI need and want to practice more. But when I get insulted like the dirtiest dog on earth, every single game, for one mistake out of five game changing actions (perfect engage that got you 3 kills, objectives, vision, gank negating, ninja splitpush to the nexus...), I simply want to quit without even trying.\n\nWhat's left then? Players who dont give a fuck? Trolls, kids chasing kills all around the maps and feeding? Why giving shit to potentially good players instead of simply and politely pointing out their mistakes so they can get better and maybe carry your games later?\n\n\"you fck** downey u didnt exhaust retard\"\n\nAfter that I was really tempted to alt f4 the fuck out of LoL.\n\nIf that guy would have just said \"karma, u should have exhaust Ez\" \nI would have explained that they both dashed out of my range while Tresh was hooking my ass off him. Pretty sure we would have done even better after this positive feedback. But no, that gold player just had to pull out his epeen and call me a retard.\n\nIt's not like he had any excuse for having this attitude, we got a double kill a few min before. It's not like I got him mad with repetitive mistakes, no! That dude was just an asshole. And sadely, that's 99% of the players I see ingame.\n\nAnd don't tell me this kind of behavior is normal and that I'm just too offendable. I'm an old %%%%, not 15. Back in my day, people were able to communicate without insulting each other. OCE , that's a lot of countries and culture. I don't know how other parents raise their kids out there but I don't think disrespect is something cool anywhere in the world.","replies":[]}]}
