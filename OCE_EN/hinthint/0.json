Also on the beta client.  \r\n\r\nJust logged in for a game, the latest patch started to download.  Completed, and I started the game.  As soon as it went into the champ loading screen the whole image went crazy - ratio shifted (horizontal elongation), colours went green tinged and the size prob went to about 2.5 m by 1.5 m.  The load completed it was the same in game.  Also, my mouse cursor wasn&#039;t visible.  I did a hard restart of my machine, reconnected, same issue.  \r\n\r\nCoincident with the latest patch, so I&#039;m going to blame it.\r\n\r\nI have no idea what pixel no. I have the screen res set at in game.  Sorry.\r\n\r\nHope it can be fixed fast.\r\ncheers and thanks","replies":[{"poster":"HintHint","date":"2017-01-11T14:18:51.313+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"since confirmed it is not due to Yolo, it really is a prob with the game.  didn't load Yolo and exactly same issue. can't indicate either MIA or intention on map without screen changing.  Alt-tabbing out a few times seems to fix until the next time my reflexes do same","replies":[]},{"poster":"HintHint","date":"2017-01-11T08:02:37.288+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"addendum.  \n\nFound that I can't signal with shift, rightlick drag right to indicate intention as it reverts back to the green screen.  also the display settings that I've had for months have altered with the patch.","replies":[]},{"poster":"HintHint","date":"2017-01-11T06:40:31.172+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Ok, I have more information.  I use an app called Yolo with my 4K screen - it makes the mouse hand visible on such a large map area.  It seems that loading that on the game affects the screen.  Found that if I alt-tabbed out then back in again it seemed to work fine.","replies":[]}]}
