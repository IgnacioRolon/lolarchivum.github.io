It will be the same time that the ban started so it'll be exactly 14 days long. You could submit a support ticket, but you'd be off your ban by the time they got to it.\n\nYou don't need to *not* type in chat to avoid a ban, just don't insult the other players or be annoyingly passive-aggressive or spammy. Mute anyone that is bugging you so you don't feel the need to respond to them. You can move the chat box off the screen if you want to.\n\n-DTN","replies":[]}]}
