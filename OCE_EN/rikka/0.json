However well intentioned this may be, it's not a good practice and shouldn't be encourage.\n\nI have a good alternative though; teach people how to make their own! It's fairly simple, and for the most part you just provide them some text to copy-paste in notepad, then they change the notepad file to a batch file.\n\n1. Open Notepad\n2. Enter the following text. All it says is for your PC to run a ping to the server through your Command Prompt;\n\n> cd c:/windows/system32\nping 103.240.227.5 -t\npause\n\n3. Save and close the file. You now need to change the file into a batch file. Batch files are simple icons that you click to run the script.\n4. To change the file type you need to display file extensions first;\n * Open Folder Options by clicking the Start button , clicking Control Panel, clicking Appearance and Personalization, and then clicking Folder Options.\n * Click the View tab, and then, under Advanced settings, clear the Hide extensions for known file types check box, and then click OK.\n(uncheck the option highlighted below in red)\nhttps://i.gyazo.com/0d64124fce088f6d91bdd11ef117ef25.png\n5. Now simply go rename your Notepad file from \"untitled.txt\" to \"untitled.bat\". .bat is the file extension for a batch file.\n\nNow you have an icon that you click and it pings the OCE server until you want it to stop! Press Ctrl+C and it will stop the ping and give you a min/max/average readout. If you only want it to ping 4 times and stop like the OP wants, just remove the \"-t\" from the script. You can even get this script to save a text recording of the ping, run a traceroute, or ping other servers and all that info can be found on the [Network, System and LoL Logs](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752674-Network-System-and-League-of-Legends-Logs#wq2) support article.\n\nLet me know if you have any questions. Except for Mac, idk about Mac.\n---\nUpdate: Apparently you can't ping OCE so easily (like you can NA), so you need to do a traceroute to OCE to find the IP right before the server and ping that one instead.
