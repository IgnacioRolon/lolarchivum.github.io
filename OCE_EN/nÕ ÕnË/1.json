Tbh im starting to consider deleting lol off my computer entirely, back on na i was a paying customer then i paid to come to oce on the belief it would be just as good as na (as f#cking if, if I was still willing to pay a cent for this game that's the first thing I would buy) then i realized oce was shit; keep this going riot and you wont have to worry about leavers cuz your population will be so small you wont even be able to make a match.\r\n\r\n#Rant over","replies":[{"poster":"SEKAI","date":"2014-12-26T12:44:14.490+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"So you wrote page after page, book after book just to say \"yeah I got into low priority queue because I leave games, riot screwed me over though\"?\n\nI can understand that some games you just want to leave and not coming back, I have done it a few times and I can say I understand the frustration. Same with getting randomly d/c'ed for seemly no apparent reason at all.\n\nHowever by leaving a game, for whatever reason, it's still an offense considering the situation of the other 9 players hence if done too many times, a punishment will be given.\n\nAnd a punishment should be, you know, actually like a proper punishment.\n\nIf you're playing an online game without considering the circumstances first, whether it's you having work coming up, your internet stability or whatnot, tbh it is not excusable that you leave in a middle of a match because you didn't bother to check beforehand. Same with leaving because you don't feel like playing anymore. Since you know, by leaving games you screwed over your teammates (and your opponents) so you have the responsibility to finish the match with them otherwise don't queue.\n\nI do not believe you can have THAT many random elements in your live, enough to net you punishments but none/most of them aren't your fault, but whatever the case if this is indeed the how it is, then I am sorry to inform you, LoL (or any match based games really) is simply not for you at the moment.\n\nIt's not like \"oh you can't do it\", ofc you can leave or d/c in games, up to an extent. Too much is asking for punishments and you got it because you did it too much.\n\nSo what's there to complain about?","replies":[]},{"poster":"TheTourist","date":"2014-12-25T10:37:28.098+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"\"Yes i have left on a fair few occasions but never cuz i didn't feel like finishing the game and today I almost left cuz it was not worth my time\"\n\nHow much is a fair few times? So judging just by this statement alone im going to assume you deserved riots action. I can probably say for the rest of the community we won't miss you if you leave. Sorry not sorry.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Lnar","date":"2014-12-25T18:40:57.450+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"I get what you're saying man.\nSad thing is, I don't think Riot will ever consider context.\nIt won't matter to them if it's a 3v5, and you're the 4th to leave - if you're a leaver, you're a leaver. I mean, from my experience, even sitting at base and talking to everyone participating can land you into a LPQ. What sucks is that player support really isn't in much of a position to do anything about it - I can't really say for sure why, for some reason I want to think that they're stupid & lazy, but then after contemplating a little it feels a little more reasonable to say - \" hey, maybe it's just in their job description to ignore this kind of stuff\". If that's the way it is, then, yeah .. they can't really do much about this.\n\n\nYou probably know for yourself that AFK'ers do actually cause some serious issues for the community. I'm in the same position as you are though, when %%%% goes wrong beyond repair then I just sit the game out and let the enemy team end ( most of the time it's mutual between team mates ), but sometimes you do get those 12 year olds who believe anything is possible if they believe hard enough (3v5's)\n\nWhat it comes down to at the end of the day man, honestly, is just dealing with the consequences. Sure man, it's not fair - but the way I see it, there really isn't much else that can be done for us. You and I seem sort of alike, in a sense that I also got pretty frustrated and wrote up a whole rant about how this whole thing seeing as it's such bull%%%%. But what you do need to  realise is that for companies like these, it's only statistics that matter - if a majority of players are not being hindered by this LPQ that's in place, then chances are that they won't do anything about it. Riot's not really here to debate you on what's right or wrong, they're just trying to serve the majority in as much efficiency as they possibly can.\n\n\nOn the plus side: I feel like the 20 minute timer is a pretty cool thing :) What sucks about it is that you aren't allowed to chat with people, or get out of that stupid box for the duration of it. This definitely needs to get hot fixed, because it's absolute bull%%%%. Reason I say the LPQ has it's plus side, is that, #1. if you're serious about playing ranked, chance are that if you have a bad game : you're going to re-queue - you might be on tilt, so it gives you a little time to get back into focus, aaand it also helps you avoid getting rematched with feeders from your last game.\n\nI haven't really read much of what you've written, shouldn't be surprised, you went all out on this one. But, I feel like you should just kind of let it go man. See if you can spend the time in the LPQ listening to music, reading something on reddit or whatever .. don't treat it as such a bad thing, because it really doesn't have to be - this is coming from a person who gets regular client-crashes every 4-6 games and has been thrown into 20minute LPQ's everyday for the last week :)","replies":[{"poster":"NÕ ÕNË","date":"2014-12-25T19:34:02.566+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Well I guess you're right, but perhaps the companies should learn to look at it a little more differently, I personally know 6 paying customers (plus myself and when they had the big skin sale about a year or so ago i bought the mega bundle (cost $200) with some spare money i'd saved, now I wouldnt buy a $10 card if i won the lottery) they have lost over the last 3 years from the stupid %%%% they do and thats only one person that knows 6, im assuming there are plenty more people out there that have stopped paying to play, if the company only took a little bit of extra time they would make more money, unfortunately you appear to be right on the laziness side.\n\nAlso over the last few days I've noticed more feeders and less rage quitters/dc'ers, exactly what I thought would happen, so as I said they fixed one problem only to bring out another, which makes this entire thing pointless, especially seeing as the ones that were troll dc'ing to piss us off are now troll feeding and refusing to sur to drag the game out, this problem could become worse than the one they just \"fixed\".","replies":[{"poster":"Lnar","date":"2014-12-25T20:15:01.553+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Having thought about it a bit, it seems like Riots approach to the problem is as follows:\n\nPeople who have a tendency to AFK will AFK until they learn to make changes in their behaviour.\nHaving a system in place that penalises people who leave games, regardless of circumstances, separates those who AFK from those who don't.\nI'm not saying it's THE solution to our problem, it doesn't necessarily work for us 100% of the time.. but it's something.\nNow, when we consider ourselves - we wouldn't necessarily label ourselves as people who leave games in a sense that we're causing a negative experience for others. We do so under certain situations that are acceptable through logic & reason.\nBut again, back to the problem with this whole system:\nThere is no way of differentiating between harmless AFKing and Harmful Afking.\nI really dot n's there being much of an effective solution to this at the moment, apart from well, not AFKing I guess?\n\nBack to the point - This is probably the most effective approach they have towards dealing with those who intentionally AFK.\nAlthough I feel as if more could be done about this, it's really difficult to come up with something that is both viable and applicable.\nThe best way to deal with this kind of thing is to just carefully manage how you decide to play this game. I know that sometimes you just want to leave because things aren't worth your time, but I mean hey - Best thing you can do when someones trolling/dragging out a game is to open up a new tab, click on your client a couple of times to fake presence, and just focus on something else till the game ends.\n\nTry not to make too much of a huge deal over trolls or AFKers . I used to and sometimes do still get pissed off, but honestly, when you give it some serious thought - It's not worth the energy man. When %%%% like that happens, you usually don't get much of a say in it, so why get bothered about it? Sure, you lose LP. But is that really why you play this game? For me, it was for a while - But then you just realise that it's better to play to get better, instead of playing to win. Make the most out of every situation, and chances are you'll be able to carry yourself up regardless of how many trolls you're faced with.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"HippoHunt3r","date":"2014-12-25T20:06:01.794+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"to put it in simple terms.

This is what (I'm assuming) would piss off alot of people, which just adds to the people who do rage quit which is why riot (in my opinion: wrongly) brought in this \"fix\"; if riot looked at a way to fix the cause (again) they wouldn't have to put in such a blanket solution.\n\nThe next problem is not only the solution they implemented, but the way they made the solution work, it only counts down the timer once you hit \"match me\" and the timer resets if you leave the que, when in this timer you are unable to do anything else on the lol tab (can't go into profiles or the shop etc), which means you have to sit there doing nothing for 20 minutes, then it automatically ques you for a match, this shows riot put minimal effort into making this work as it merely runs off the que timer it doesnt actually factor in \"hey this bloke waited 15 mins then left and came back 10 seconds later, we'll start the timer where he left off\".\n\nThe problem with bringing in a blanket solution is that it will negatively affect more innocent people than it will guilty people; think about it, if you wanna leave or w/e to troll but you're gonna have to put up with the 20min que cd just to play, yer you wont just quit anymore, you'll just find another way to troll (intentional feed, abuse etc) which will then lead to people who are genuinely interested in playing a game rage quitting (despite the ban), this then makes the innocent the \"guilty\" and what for, for wanting to have enjoyment from something they do in their free time to enjoy, this is why riot needs to go to the cause of the problem, not just the overall problem.\n\nNow if you are going to reply again please at least read my posts entirely so i don't have to re-iterate anything again and secondly don't bother replying if you're just going to say \"you deserve it\" and just be one of those douche-bags who sit at their computer talking sh!t without any facts or points to validate their argument, this post was intended to tell riot \"you f#cked up with this \"solution\", it doesn't work well\" not \"im bored imma go say suck sh!t to some people on the forums\".
