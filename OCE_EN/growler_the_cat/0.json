Since culturally Chinese utilises insults in a casual environment such as a conversation between friends and ofc video games chat quite often. It's not a \"trying to get under your skin\" but rather just joking around, they're also open to be \"insulted\", as long as the \"jokes\" are not too cutting too deep or going too far.\n\nThat's probably the reason why that particular stereotype came up, saying that Chinese people are always arguing or something along the lines, when it's strictly a cultural thing.\n\nHOWEVER, \n\nThere is always a flip side to all of this, a game culture like this has a higher chance to breed ragers. So there's that too I guess.\n\nTbh I am not sure why there seems to be an influx of non-English speaking Chinese players recently, which is definitely fine as I am not picky about my teammates, but MAN, don't some of them REALLY need to calm the hell down and shut the fk up.\n\nBut then I suppose every community/region is the same.","replies":[{"poster":"llLILITHll","date":"2015-09-22T11:12:17.445+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Tbh, I cannot really agree with you about your point,\nsince I have not seen many countries cursing you by calling you as motherf***er as a joke.\nThe chinese people I have come across in OCE servers were all rude, never spoke in English,\nused only Chinese to communicate and only spoke English when they were cursing me, except cao nima...","replies":[{"poster":"SEKAI","date":"2015-09-22T14:38:15.904+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=llLILITHll,realm=OCE,application-id=Ntey9fRZ,discussion-id=9EBTrdHE,comment-id=000300000000,timestamp=2015-09-22T11:12:17.445+0000)\n>\n> Tbh, I cannot really agree with you about your point,\n> since I have not seen many countries cursing you by calling you as motherf***er as a joke.\n\n\"Mofo\" in Chinese is actually a swear that is on par with say \"fk u\" in English, it is so overused it no longer means anything other than a simple swear (ofc we're strictly on the plain of informal language here). \n\nThere are other insults that can be considered offensive in English, but means pretty much nothing in the casual Chinese conv. between friends or across nets.  \n\n> The chinese people I have come across in OCE servers were all rude, never spoke in English,\n\nYou're speaking to a Chinese now, not only by blood but also by culture and education.\n\nIf you meet idiotic Chinese, don't think that it's all of them, that's not a great thing to do.

But we do share this world and sometimes that requires compromise, \nBut you can also be paired with someone who doesn't communicate in champ select, doesn't work as a team and the only thing they say in the whole game is something like \"NAH YA PLAY MUM TOOOOO SHIT\" which tbh might as well be a different language. So it's not like we English speaking people are all perfect in communication. \n\nWhat exactly are they entitled to?\nAnd they aren't immune to reports.\n\nAnd to my knowledge they aren't labelled racist, no one in this board has called anyone racist, And they shouldn't. Saying that Asian people speak Chinese/Korean and Aussies/kiwis speak English and so communication is difficult, is a perfectly valid point there's nothing offensive about it.

I have been in games where the only enlish speakers are the people i play with. An average day of league for me (and i assume many others) goes like this. Say we have a 4 man pre made. We are willing to work around the player not in our premade. Approx 90% of games the chinese player will call top (fair enough). 5 seconds to go they will select a character (usually something you would not play toplike Aurelian Sol). Game loads in. Game starts. Straight to the turret in top lane (no help for jungle or the rest of team). 1:40 minions and usually opponent hit the lane straight onto the opposition champ, no or very little farming. 1st blood. Me n my mates \"top play safe u are now behind\". No response. Chinese player walks back to lane (as my experience they always have flash ignight not tp). Same as first time (even though they are at least 1 level behind) straight onto the enemy champ no farm. Another death. Opponent leaves lane no pings still no communication. This continues up until about 12 mins in usually around 0/7/0. Then they start with the broken english. No gank. U dogs. Australia sh*t and whatever other garbled nonsence they come out with. Tgen they start wandering into enemy jungle and mid feeding and trolling all the while. Gg game over. End screen. Block and report. Wait a couple of mins. Champ select. Same chinese player. Same thing calls top rinse and repeat. The 2 issues are A reporting for trolling not picking up these players and B the block only seems to effect the chat. I would personally have a longer que time and avoid seeing these players on my team. Than have 2 or more games stuck with them over and over.
