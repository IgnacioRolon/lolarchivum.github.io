But the people... the people goes from one extreme to another. There's the funniest ones that dance with you in the empty dragon pit just for the fun of it - with the whole team being in on it too. They're ones like me who are waiting in on the Udyr and Urgot Star Guardian skins.  Then... there's the really fkn toxic ones... I expected the toxicity of the players in a pvp game, but damn today takes the cake. \n\nIt's ok when it stays in chat... but when I actually get a ban warning because of something not even remotely true, that's a whole fkn different case. \n\nToday while playing on draft, I got stuck with decent players (not at all great, bordering bad) that always made bad calls. Played with them TWICE in a row. In the second game, their losses were blamed on me the \"support\". \n\nI'm new-ish so Level 58 (i think?) and played Rakan in this game, with M7 (not flexing, but this comes into play).\n\nWhen the jungle would come in, they would always do so when I'm too far away, or I have really low health for a Syndra one shot and ulti and when the enemy bot team had ALL abilities plus heal, plus our dead ADC (which tbh they weren't too good either), plus my low af health. Or even after giving them blatant ward vision of the fight becoming a 2v3 with a fed enemy jng... they still go all in. Knowing from their previous gameplay and current build, I spam ping them not to engage. But they still do. Ends up in a double kill for our dear Sydnra. Blames it on my \"lack of engage, when we could take them\". I stand by my decisions that I ddnt give them a triple. \n\nMid-game. When I've constantly made warnings and pings about how I'm still not near close enough to the team to set up an engage or cancel lux or fiora ulti-s... they still go in ALL HELL even knowing about the syndra, neeko, lux, and heca CC... with bad KDAs and bad builds... and dies. After gettng them 3/5 kills after their bad call I get blamed for \"not engaging\" even when I went all in. I wasn't ever bothered much by this since I knew that with Rakan, my combos essentially becomes flashes with right builds - and good teams always noticed this fact anyway. \n\nThere were more examples... but then during all those times, especially beggining of the game they asked whether my account was \"bought\" - which I didn't even know happens (like wtf?? Who does???). I didn't get it at first until they kept bringing it up. Throughout the whole game it was just the whole flaying of \"Shoulda spent it on a coach than bough an account\" (jfc ofcourse there's \"coaches\"), or when the server messed up \"Shoulda spent of wifi than the account\" that I had to constantly ignore. **That was fine**. Expected in pvp games. I actually think it's really fkn **funny** that these bad players have to find another source to blame for their crap plays.\n\nEnd of the day... I get a warning that anymore signs of \"shared account\" and this whole account will be banned and deleted or something. Which I found was complete **BS**. Because frankly the only thing I've spent on is the Rakan, Lulu SG skins, and a Xayah SG b-day gift for a friend (which was my ADC, ahah u know ur bad u lil shart but u deserve it anywy). Which I'm guessing I will lose if I get another \"warning\", again fkn BS based solely on **FALSE REPORTS**. \n\nI just started playing league 3 months ago... and just spent money on those skins really recently too. Losing the account would be fine, because I could just as easily get the same masteries and champs. But the fact that I could lose the $50 bucks I spent on skins based on badly analysed reports from **insecure crap players** just pisses me off.\n\nI've read a lot of \"_Riot doesn't care about its players_\" discussion... so I have no hope that they would do something about monitoring these kind of situations from happening again. \n\nBut I just needed a whole as rant and way to get all this garbage out. Anyway, I've been told about something called high/low-e...lows??? - that would probably benefit me more especially as a Rakan main... i tried searching... but I still have no clue wtf those mean. \n\nAnyway. Peace out! Enjoy the long AF rant XD \n\n{{champion:497}} \nP.S.

We do it for the love of the game and the role, not the acknowledgement or accolades. I have also seen many, many games similar to you'res.
