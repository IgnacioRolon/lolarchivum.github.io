I am sure a lot of adc players feel the same. Everyone is playing random stuff bot lane and hoping for the win. It makes it so much harder to climb and i am slowly losing the interest in the game. Hope they are fixing it next patch otherwise i&#039;m out.","replies":[{"poster":"WoadKethunt","date":"2018-06-20T13:34:15.119+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"not quite, bot lane is the lane where you stick your support and your main carry, for a long time that was ranged ads, saying adcs are all bot lane can be is like saying all top can be is tanks. \n\ni am not saying right now bot lane is perfect but good players will adapt and  better players can still play marksman","replies":[]},{"poster":"dn54321","date":"2018-08-03T14:08:05.036+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I totally agree. Nowadays I think to myself why I should main adc. The role is basically now to survive as long as you can. There is mid and support where you don't need to think about these things. RATHER you think about how to gain an advantage. Also even if an arc reaches late game. Tanks are too Tanky and assassins can absolutely one shot you. Playing adc requires constant tempering of the mind, constant focus but the reward isn't as significant nowadays. It's much easier to show your prowess at other roles. Tldr: adc is too stressful. Playing another role is so much easier and relaxing.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Meowsaki","date":"2018-06-21T13:30:41.691+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Bet these people are not real adc mains so they can speak like they didn't even care. :)\nMaking a role completely unplayable is a terrible mistake, why are you trying to defending for Riot when things are just not right??\nWAKE UP PUPPETS!","replies":[]},{"poster":"Quinncest","date":"2018-06-20T15:04:59.247+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"***","replies":[{"poster":"Orange Caramel","date":"2018-06-21T13:29:20.688+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Meanwhile I got permanently banned for playing mages as support.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Orange Caramel","date":"2018-06-21T13:26:42.832+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I don't understand all the crying people are doing.
