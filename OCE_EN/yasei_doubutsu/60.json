(If not I recommend [Malwarebytes](https://www.malwarebytes.org/))\n  * If you do, please ensure it is fully updated and run a full system scan.\n\nI'd also recommend changing your password to your email/any other accounts that may be compromised to prevent any further issues.","replies":[{"poster":"Jonius7","date":"2016-04-14T08:59:04.368+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yep, Riot sent the standard response of please answer these questions:\n> The original email address used to register the account:\nList of locations that you have played on this account (City and Country):\nYour current IP address(http://whatsmyip.net/)\nFirst five champions ever purchased on this account:\nFirst item ever purchased with RP (if applicable):\nList of payment methods used to purchase RP:\nWho made this account?\nAny other people (including family members/friends) that have ever had access to the account:\n\nI've replied with the most detailed answers I could, and am waiting for a response.\n\nAlso in the process of Full System Scanning all computers I use for LoL with Norton and Malwarebytes.
