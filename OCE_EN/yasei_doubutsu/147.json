And since he doesn&#039;t have it on, he doesn&#039;t do any dmg.\r\n\r\nThat suddenly (Flez Q players should know this) It feel like one team has high diamonds, the other has silver?\r\nI&#039;m not kidding, how did the match making do this? (These are normal games)\r\n\r\nPre season should only mean, hay lets try out these new things (And maybe they work)\r\nand fail while also learning of these new changes so we can get better.\r\n\r\nNot, how do I use spells and abilities, what are runes and masteries, what does my champion do?\r\n---\r\n\r\nIn a few weeks this will go away i know, but those games are still suck.","replies":[{"poster":"jadelink","date":"2016-11-10T10:54:58.544+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"The new stuff leaves some players confused, and others trying out stuff they really cant do, or turns out not to work but looked good on paper.","replies":[]},{"poster":"JesusForgotHisGA","date":"2016-11-11T16:31:25.242+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Game is 100% a joke at the moment.
