A lot of the time when the report system comes up it's said, in one way or another, that the behaviours that are punishable are often shaped based on what people report. Quite frankly, I agree with the sentiment, and I'm sure Riot would too. It makes total sense for Riot to be policing this, after all the game is intended for an \"audience\" as young as 13, so there'd be no sense in allowing such a lighthearted attitude toward illegal activities to exist freely in-game.\n\nI'll be honest, I've never seen these kinds of statements/behaviours in-game. If I did though, I'm certain I would have reported the behaviour. It is truly disgusting to see people treating these acts with such a lighthearted attitude.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Lord Sesshomaru","date":"2017-10-24T10:26:59.135+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"Im pretty tolerant of a lot of things, and I treat most in game talk as just water off a duck's back.\n\nBut this is something that truly disgusts me, and that I think should be treated very seriously.\nTheres already too many games/movies that make light of drugs and make them out to be some fun pastime. and then they wonder why young people start doing them.","replies":[{"poster":"JasonWazza","date":"2017-10-24T11:33:50.800+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":">and then they wonder why young people start doing them.\n\nI mean, i think a decent chunk of the kids do it because they aren't allowed and Peer Pressure.","replies":[{"poster":"Lord Sesshomaru","date":"2017-10-24T12:08:45.376+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thats true!\nBut its easier to be peer pressured into doing something, when your favourite actors are doing it in movies all the time.\n_\"It cant be all bad when you can joke about stroking furry walls and waking up in funny situations with a monkey and a naked asian man right?\"_","replies":[]}]}]}]}
