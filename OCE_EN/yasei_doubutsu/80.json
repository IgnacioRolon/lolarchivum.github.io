On the Oceania server the determination of whether language is directed as abuse and is intended to cause distress, or is simply a part of the colloquial and a part of our uniquely amiable culture; can be quite hard to differentiate through haphazard cursory methods; such as detection of keywords generally associated with execration of other players or simply particularly visceral malediction.\n\nIn summary, chat filter is dumb, it doesn't work, and it probably won't be kept for very long for aforementioned reasons.

I admit there is great impact in being concise, and simple language is far less prone to errors, but sometimes flowerly description, musical pacing and structure, or simply selecting the most appropriate word, should be more relevant in writing for leisure.\n\nI was not trying to express 'pseudo-intellect', I guess I was just unconsciously venting because I miss english.{{item:3070}}","replies":[{"poster":"TheDemonEmperor","date":"2017-12-27T08:47:03.775+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"To be a good writer you must learn to be concise.
