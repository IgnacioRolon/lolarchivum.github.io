I didnt rank at all, not untill the end of season 1 anyway.\nBack when the MMR system was fucked and I was on NA.\n\nI didnt want to go into rank and not know anything.\nSo before I touched ranked I played every champion (that were released at the time)\nGot to know there passives, Q-W-E and R&#039;s.\nI had about 400 Norm wins under my belt when I first started.\nBut, here was the problem.\n\nAt the time, to me.\nRanked was just another casual normal. I played what ever the hell I wanted in what ever role I wanted.\nI did the role, like if I was support I bought wards (But at the time..... Im sure you guys remember supporting in those days)\nAnd did my best of what I knew, like how was the role done properly (I didnt know at the time, it was Meh to me I didnt care)\n\nI didnt really have the time to play, I never have untill recently actually.\nBut I always enjoyed playing, first ever champion was Garren, then being the fur%%% that I am. I noticed Nasus and started playing him.\nI liked alot of champions but thats not important.\n\nSo I didnt play ranked that much and about 10 games or so, thats when I noticed it.\nThere massive difference between normals of going who ever and where ever, because at the time NO ONE GAVE A SHIT.\nand the OMG WHY DIDNT YOU BAN X, or WHY CANT YOU DO X.\n\nBecause being the new guy that I was, I had no idea about bans or what champions where &quot;In the Meta&quot;.\nAnd I sucked... Alot at CSing *I still do - cough, cough* So I would always get yelled at while being an &quot;ADC&quot;.\nSo this is what made me lean towards jungling and supporting. \n\nAlright, so its now Season 2.\nAnd Ive played the game for a while now. and I now own every champion in the game (At that Time and I still keep up to date) \nAnd I want to rank again, and this time. I want to be good, I want to get better at the game.\nSo I started paying attention to who gets banned alot in ranked, and who gets picked.\nIt was easier to keep track of then, its way harder now.\n\nThey have now removed the MMR system, and now have Bronze-Silver-Gold etc.\nAT the time I played alot with my boyfriend - who isnt that anymore. He was the one that got me into league and taught me how to play.\nSo we duo&#039;ed alot together, which led to some interesting augments.\n\nI wanted to get better so I always warded (Back when you could have more then 3 green wards)\nand did my best to improve myself.\n...how ever. As my old attitude he treated all ranked games like normals and didnt care. And even refused to work as a team mate.\nI would ask him to ward his lane (As he was a mid laner) But refused to buy green wards or any.\nEventually after doing my starting promo&#039;s got into B2-3 I cant remember. And pretty much just kept going back and forth between the two.\n\nNow Ive had those guys on my team and it sucks. Ive had people get really mad and just intentionally feed, or go afk.\nOr just extremely toxic that you actually wish you could kill yourself. Ive had those guys that say &quot;Im a smurf lemme go/do X&quot;\nWell, if your a smurf buddy YOU WOULDN&#039;T BE IN BRONZE. All smurfs will start at silver and will not be in bronze, and will quickly climb the ladder.\n\nWell anyway, after playing with my BF I ended up dropping to Bronze 5. Yep Ive been there, B5 with like -10 LP.\nAt the time I just could not find out how I was loosing so many games. I thought about it for a long time.\nIs it ELO Hell? Is it the AFKers and feeders.\n\nAnd that&#039;s when it hit me.\nAs much as I do get very toxic players, AFKers, feeders etc. Those are like 1-2 out of 10 games.\nAnd sometimes can actually be overcome Its a very tall fucking mountain but its doable.\nIt his him... It was my Duo partner. So I gave it a shot, being alone in SoloQ. Not duoing with anyone.\nI did what I had to do, I filled every role that I could and practiced each role.\nMainly support as tha&#039;ts the easiest one. Now, its really hard to trust someone to carry you. and in bronze NO ONE WILL CARRY.\nLike holy shit, dont trust someone if they say that they are good. but if they end up being the carry, just do your job.\n\nI liked supporting/Jungling so I would do those roles as best that I could. I learnt to peel and protect my carries to the best of my abilities and still learning more now. Because back then, everyone in bronze WANTS to be the carry. They wanna be the hero. No one wanted to support, so of course no one knew how to support. So I would be first pick, 2-3-4 or last pick. Didnt fuckin matter if no one called it. I would insta lock that fucker and say &quot;Sup&quot; - &quot;Support&quot;. Man the reaction I would get out of that.\n\n&quot;Wow... really you actually supporting&quot;\n&quot;OUR FIRST PICK.... IS SUPPORTING WTF&quot; etc you get the drill.\nman that was back when I did shen support, lux, sona, janna, THAT WAS WHEN TARIC WAS LIKE THE ONLY TANK SUPPORT (Apart from Alister but I wasn&#039;t confident as I am now with the combo)\n\nAnd I fed, I fed hard I still feed alot sometimes to this day. But, I would always heal, always try my best to take that fucking blitz hook, ward give vision, give shields. As much as some marksman&#039;s fucked me off to the maximum. It was my job, It was my job to make sure that they could carry, that they could get dragons, barons, towers and get inhibitors and maybe, just fuckin maybe. Win me that game for all that hard work, and sometimes. I would lose, the carries... couldn&#039;t carry. Sometimes they could, but that 40-50 + mins isnt wasted.\n\nBecause where the fuck did I go wrong? was it me? *Yes if I was feeding* or did something else happen?\nWell, try a different approach. I did, tried the aggressive play styles with my supports, tried the Passive as fuck plz dont hurt me style.\nand figured out which one suits me, and the carries that I play with. \n\nEventually after a very long time of toxicity and pain. I did it, by myself.\nI made it from Bronze 5 to Silver 5 by a few weeks before season 2 had ended. I muted all assholes who were toxic, I did what I wanted to do. \nI did my roles, no going Annie support or Fiddle support and just going full AP and taking CS.\nNo if I could that support role, I would have ALL THE FUCKING GREEN WARDS EVER.\nI lost alot of games/promo&#039;s but I did it I got to silver.\n\nNow its season 3.\nThe LP decay has been put into place.\nI know play a mix of normals to practice and ranked games when I feel like it.\nBut as I said at the start, I don&#039;t have time to play, certainly as much as I would like too. Maybe like 1-2 games a day, 5-8 games a week in total.\n\nand after a long time of being absent, I decayed into Bronze 1. (Which cant happen anymore as Gold below can no longer decay)\nIt didnt bother me so much, I did it once I can do it again. and i did, played two games got into promo&#039;s won them. IT was easy as pie.\nI then noticed the HUGE difference between silver and bronze.\nIt wasn&#039;t the toxicity or anything of that, oh no. Silver players think that they are on top of the world now that they got out of bronze.\nAnd are even MORE likely to flame/rage and leave the game.\nIt was the skill level of some sorts, bronze players just didnt understand objectives, or not to chase (WHICH SOME SILVER/GOLD PEOPLE STILL FUCKING DO). It was just a skill difference in the game.\n\nAt that time, I had a low level smurf account, so I got that to lvl 30.\nAnd I could rank with it, and wanted to see if I could climb out of bronze again. Mainly because I was expecting to be placed in B2-3 again liek I did last time. But nope, I got Silver 4. WHICH WAS THE SAME ELO AS MY BLOODY MAIN. I just, couldn&#039;t get into bronze anymore.\n\nI tried making a jump to gold, I reached silver 2 I think. But as I said I didn&#039;t have the time, I think I did duo with one of my fiends that I made online for like 5-8 games? but we haven&#039;t duo&#039;ed since. that was during silver 4 days.\nAnd here is where I made my mistake. I managed to get from B5 to Silver 2 all alone. and was scared of making it to gold.\nBut I really wanted too, and this one time some random on my friends list asked me to duo with him.\nGod damn stupid fucking me... said yes.\nThe guy was Silver 5? I think. So I thought he was decent at the game, but its not hard to climb as long as you let others carry you. After all, that&#039;s what I did/do.\n\nAnd this guy would ALWAYS over extend, always go into the enemy jungle especially with a jungler/other role with no escape and without vision and would ALWAYS give first blood. And just kept... Fucking chasing. He was like a very, very bad blood hound. He would chase even the smallest scent of blood. and try and go for that kill. He didn&#039;t care if it was a 1v5 or what evs.\nAnd stupid fucking me just dint have the heart to say &quot;Look I dont want to duo with you...&quot; In fear of sounding mean and such.\nSo I kept fucking playing with him, after dropping into silver 4 again. I was on massive tilt.\nAnd to make things worse, without any notification or explanation. He removed me from the &quot;Friends&quot; list. Never seen or heard from him again.\nI was bouncing up and down from Silver 4 to 3. But didn&#039;t have the time or the PC to play. As that&#039;s when my tower blew up.\n\nI didnt make it...\nI failed to get to gold, I missed out on the champion ship skin which I REALLY wanted. and I felt like crap for not taking my own advice.\nI played normals for so long after that. I was done...\n\nSeason 4 now (The current season before 5 now)\nStill silver, still just played a lot of normals. I think my Normal/Ranked ratio was like 8-1. But I wanted to do it. I wanted Gold.\nMainly because I was sick of being called &quot;Silver trash&quot; from OTHER SILVER PLAYERS and sometimes even fucking bronze players.\nLike really guys?\n\nAnd I knew I could do it. I have a 55% to 60% win rate. I can... Make it.\nI wanted the Victorious Sivir skin. As she is one of my Fav marksman&#039;s when I do play them.\n\nAnd come one, how could I be an Acolyte Of Shurima and NOT have a victorious skin based on a Shurimian.\nAnd I even have a real life friend who keeps &quot;Accidentally&quot; removing me from there friends list as he goes down and removes everyone who&#039;s not Gold Elo. Which I find rather funny really, that makes me laugh.\n\nSo, I started playing ranked.\nThat Gnar Top main, Ziggs/Syndra main mid.\nAmumu/Vi main in the jungle.\nSivir/Jinx/Cait marksmans\nand Naut/Braum/Sona/ fuck I main ALL SUPPORTS.\n\nAnd I went from Silver 4 to 3.\nSome assholes nothing the mute button cant fix.\nThis was also when I decided to record my ranked games and put them up on youtube so everyone could help me get better.\nAll I got tho was &quot;Its too long you suck at CSing&quot;\nBut I still did it, when ever I felt like recording I recorded a ranked game.\nSome were wins, some were losses.\n\nFinally Im silver 3 again, Blasted straight into silver two.\nA little bit of a road block, Im still Silver so I will get matched with and against Bronze/Unranked players.\nAfter yelling into my screen and not into chat, and a few games later im in Silver 1 Promo&#039;s.\nThis... Is the furthest Ive ever gotten.\n\nOnce again some more hurdles and problems, and to be honest I felt like I didn&#039;t deserve to be SIlver 1.\n2 games, I had an Enemy bard feed intentionally giving first blood to my marksman, he fed all lanes really hard ended up going 0/20 and had boots and other move speed items to &quot;Get to lane faster&quot;.\nMan the enemy lucian almost 1v2 us. Me and my Marksman Nearly lost lane to this guy, AND WE HAD GOLD/EXP and NUMBERS ADVANTAGE.\nWe would have lost that if Bard didn&#039;t troll that so hard. He got 9 reports that game. (I have yet to receive any email/Notification that he was banned wtf riot).\n\nSecond game, Enemy top Darius was AFK all game, he didn&#039;t disconnect as he was still there.\nAnother easy win... which I didn&#039;t earn. I mean fuck I almost fed in those two games. I dint earn Silver 1 at all.\nBut, I reported those players. Had more games, more assholes, more people that just refused to communicate.\nLost some, I won some.\nThen Finally... Gold Promotional series. I&#039;ve done it, Im here.\nThat&#039;s when I felt like recording again, I started up Fraps. \nAnd I wanted to record my first attempt at getting into gold.\n\nNow Im not gonna lie, I am one of THE most Saltiest guys you would ever meet. But I will never intentionally throw a game.\nI will never be toxic in chat, sure I might say. &quot;God damn your stupid&quot; or &quot;Fucking retard&quot; But I actually take pride in the fact that Ive never once been reported, never once had that Warning or Ban. And that&#039;s as far as I go to &quot;Being Toxic&quot; and I only do stuff if someone REALLY fucked up.\nSo I have a policy to Yell at the screen and not into chat. I might say somethings but Im only Human and of course I&#039;ll get mad. Who wouldn&#039;t?\n\n*I have all these games recorded*\nGame 1 into promos.\nIm last pick, Bruam support.\nSome minor issues.\nSomeone refuses o back down from being Mid Azir and Top Amumu *A FUCKING TOP AMUMU IN WHICH HE PICKED INTO A RIVEN*\nGame is thrown really, really hard by us.\nAzir feeds the mid lane, and surprise surprise Amumu doesn&#039;t do well top. Azir is one of those guys thats from another region or some shit, speaking poor English and is very toxic. I ended up muting him.\nMy faith in his game has decreasing, as time passes Im now also feeding harder and harder. Im still trying to do my best, warding and peeling for my ADC. Who has the complete Opposite to Azis attitude. Very well spoken, Completly calm, he never once wavered in his abilities to carry.\nTruth be told it was him that kept my faith in the game, so I did what any good support should do. I warded and Peeled, I gave my life using everything to make sure Lucian never died.\n....And it still wasnt enough.\nAzir still being toxic now causing Amumu to go on Tilt. I know notice something.... I barely seen anything form the Enemies jungler *Gragus*.\nEvery single time there was a team figt or some form of group up by the enemy, to siege and get objectives. He would go off and farm the jungle.\nHE DONE FUCKED UP. We finaly, FINALLY caught there carries out. We won the fight, we won the game.\nAll because Lucian carried hard and Gragus refused to work with his team.\n\nGame 2.\nIm Amumu jungle.\nStarts off really well, Olaf gets first blood against Irelia, and I help get a kill down in bot lane.\nAs a note, Olaf doesn&#039;t speak at all this game. and also, refuses to listen to pings.\nMinor fights, Each team gaining/Losing the lead. Mostly over stupid reasons and shit.\nThen it happens, Olaf goes AFK doesn&#039;t say anything so for a while we all think hes still in the game.\nWe ended up losing alot of small fights. Hes afk for like 6+ mins.\nThen TF our mid, also goes AFK, halfway between TF going afk which was like 3+ mins Olaf comes back.\nThen eventually TF comes back. I almost lost the game because two people went afk.\nBut in the end, we won it.\n\nGame 3.\nI FUCKED UP.\nI ended up being last pick, Karthus mid. I chose him for X/Y reason in which they didn&#039;t work out.\nIm against GP mid and I cant stop him, I get no proper ganks or help.\nBot lane + my jungler ended up feeding there top-Jungler- and bot lane. EVEN THERE SUPPORT HAD LIKE 3+ KILLS.\nI ended up being useless, they got tanky, I couldn&#039;t do DMG.\nWe got wrecked hard. I ended up being 0/6 by the end of the game\n\nIts ok, 2 wins 1 Loss.\nI just need to win 1 more its all ok. That 1 loss means nothing.\n\nGame 4.\nIm Gnar top against Reneckton.\nI play passively so I can get stronger and do more late game.\nLittle skirmish he tries to dive me and fails. Xin my jungler comes in to help, I fucked up wasn&#039;t paying any attention and reacted very late into the fight. Ren flashes over a wall, I should have left it. But stupid me also flashed over.\nAnd I gave first blood to Elise she was there.\nI continue to play while also being mad at myself for the &quot;Never Chase&quot; rule that I have.\nAfter the pushing top and being really annoying while also trying my best not to die.\nI punish ren by getting CS, getting towers every time He TP&#039;s to try and gank, some of the ganks worked, some didnt.\nHis first fuck up, I know have a CS lead, Im the highest in the game at this point even higher then my own marksman.\nIve gotten BOTH top towers, and is now roaming as an additional tank/support for my marksman.\nRen fucks up some more with some failed TP ganks, allowing us to get even more objectives.\n\nDiana and bot lane just end up snowballing so hard, I ended up getting caught out once making my total deaths for the game 0/2.\nBut we ended up just splitting getting dragons, getting towers a baron and Finally a win.\n\nI did it. I got to gold.\nSure I can&#039;t &quot;Orbwalk&quot; or CS that well. But, Flame the screen not in chat. You have the right to be salty just dont let it effect the game too much.\nGetting objectives wins the games, Learn to not always be the carry.\nTry not to feed as hard as me too.\nMute assholes, and make a rule to refuse to sink to the level of those AFKers, trolls, etc.\nYou will get wrecked in some games, just as you will wreck others in some.\nYou will lose games, No one, ever has a perfect 100% win rate. \nIts ok to lose, Ive been there.\nI have been in Bronze 5. &quot;ELO HELL&quot;\nIve had intentional feeders on my team, Leavers, Abusers that would make some rappers jealous.\nIve had that &quot;So close to going up&quot; only to fall right back down.\nIve fed so hard that I could end world hunger with my deaths.\n\nSo to all those guys that want to get into Silver from Bronze.\nOr Gold from Silver. \nYou can do it, just Acknowledge your fuck ups.\nYou dun goofed, but move on. Don&#039;t hold onto that.\nFind those champions that are just so good to climb with. \nFind that sweet role that&#039;s your bread N Butter.\nMake some Self rules and follow them.\nHeck try and record some of your games, be open with &quot;Well your bad you fucked up here&quot; Be salty, because you have to take every little grain with some salt.\nTake time to learn, don&#039;t rush anything. Play when you have time, and play when you feel like it.\n\nI was REALLY bad at the game, after all I was bronze. I was Silver, FUCK im still bad.\nBut im better now, im better then what I&#039;ve ever been\nAnd you can be too, Learn to be better, learn to get better.\n\nIf I can feed in most of my games, but Still be in gold.\nThen Anyone can, Don&#039;t to it intentionally, please don&#039;t flame as that just makes your goal of climbing harder.\n\nBy myself, I have gone from Bronze 5 *BRONZE 5 FFS* to Gold 5, sure it took awhile but nothing is is more rewarding then finally earning it.\nEspecially by yourself.\nSo if your bronze, you can make it.\nJust don&#039;t be &quot;That bronze flamer&quot;\nAnd record some of your games if you can, show them to randoms or show them to your friends.\nSay &quot;Yeah I fucked up... But im getting better!&quot;\n\nI can now call myself a Worthy Acolyte for Shurima.\nIll be uploading those vids soon, takes like 200+ mins each and there&#039;s 4 of em.\nI wont be doing any links or that kind of shit, I just wanted to let everyone know that its possible.\nAnd that you can make it happen.\n\nFOR SHURIMA!","replies":[{"poster":"Talon12","date":"2015-10-12T11:12:58.054+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"*5 years later...* reaches gold","replies":[{"poster":"Yasei Doubutsu","date":"2015-10-12T11:47:45.783+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Lol pretty much, I didn't get to play much so I couldn't just sit down and grind it out like two gay men.\nBut when I had the free time I did it!","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Zorphiax","date":"2015-10-10T05:55:46.727+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"It's a great story but, I don't think anyone is going to read it all.\nput a TL:DR there.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Essembie","date":"2015-10-15T00:04:04.233+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5GgflscOmW8","replies":[]},{"poster":"Bookbash","date":"2015-10-13T01:39:48.293+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"That's a long story, but I read it all. From what I gathered, you have to play a carry role and hope that your team aren't retards. Also gathered that Bronze=silver=gold, which seems realistic from the games I have viewed.\nGood job though!\n\nI do have one question though. In your journey, did you talk at all to your team about upcoming objectives, or do you just stay silent and accept that they are noobs and let the flow of the game go with whatever and put up with noob plays?\n\nFor example, dragon is up soon (1 minute), I would normally tell the team to push lanes, or back now and get ready. But in true bronze-silver-gold fashion they see an enemy in our jungle and all start to gather to chase that enemy. Of course they are battered and bruised by the enemy team, and even if no side got the dragon, they just lost all map pressure.\n\nYou talk to them first? Or just keep silent, accept that the dragon is gone and go push the mid lane while they do dumb things in the jungle?","replies":[{"poster":"Yasei Doubutsu","date":"2015-10-14T00:36:09.086+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I didnt play a carry role at all, I pretty much literally Jungled, and supported to Gold.\nAnd I talk alot in my games, usually Dragon/Barons up.\nStop over extending.\nStop chasing, you idiots. < that ones in every game.\nGet objectives.\nFocus X. etc.\n\nI do mute people tho, that get heavily abusive or just dont offer anything in anyway way.\nCommunication does a lot to win games, I once had a game we could have won easy but I had a top/Jungle and an ADC that didn't speak at all. nothing, they refused to speak to me and the mid laner when we asked, and even refused to buy appropriate items.
