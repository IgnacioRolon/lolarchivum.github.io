(he got a +1 when he missed a minion.)\n\nYas could have windwalled the Poppy ult to my knowledge as well when she did it in mid lane.\n\nFarsight is meh on a support, you have to spend more money on pinks to clear wards with it, though you do get slightly more vision in the trade, benefits you most if Jungler is always smiting Raptors and has the Upgraded Red.\n\nCome to think of it i don't recall an exhaust.\n\nThat's it.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Void Escapee","date":"2016-10-31T17:58:53.886+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"All I must say is this, regardless of what division you are, how many champions you own, runes you have, or which skin you pick, remember this:\n\n1) THAT IS ANOTHER HUMAN BEING YOU ARE PLAYING WITH!\n2) YOU DONT KNOW HOW OLD THEY ARE, IF THEY ARE \"YOUNG\" THAT DOESNT MEAN THEY ARE TOO STUPID AND IF THEY ARE \"OLD\" THAT THEY ARE TOO SLOW!\n3) THEY MIGHT HAVE HAD A REALLY F%^K$#G S#@T DAY AND THE LAST THING THEY NEEDED' WAS TO BE TOLD \"THEY ARE LESS THAN NOTHING!\"\n4) THEIR ENGLISH MAY NOT BE CAMBRIDGE UNIVERSITY QUALITY, SO LET OTHER PLAYERS KNOW IN ADVANCE IF ENGLISH IS NOT YOUR FIRST LANGUAGE (IT IS THE INTERNATIONAL STANDARD LANGUAGE THOUGH), DO THIS OPENLY AND IN AN HONEST MANNER SO THAT YOUR TEAM UNDERSTANDS!
