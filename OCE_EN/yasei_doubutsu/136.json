And he never once upgraded his trinket, communicated with us. Even told his own friends to fuck off.\r\nRefused to ward, refused to group with his carry.\r\n\r\nIs this JUST as reportable as the singed player.\r\nWho actually communicated with his team, didn&#039;t buy a sightstone, left his carry to 2 v 1 even tho they asked him not too.\r\n\r\nIf that singed player should be banned, then this guy should be too.","replies":[{"poster":"theminiom","date":"2016-11-23T09:46:29.790+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"the singed did not deserve to be banned but this \"support\" that you encounted definitely deserved to be banned","replies":[]},{"poster":"Brucey","date":"2016-11-23T08:41:23.397+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yes, the difference is your playing normals where as he's playing singed support in ranks. Their 2 different topics rank and normals act different. Normals is suppose to be a fun game, try something new, something different all hell break the meta but when i comes to rank this changes you do your role properly not trolling but people don't see it and end up trolling anyone if he does do it in rank then its a problem but normals has nothing to do with it.\n\nPlus saying this guy should be banned too. That's wrong he shouldn't be banned if he only did this for one game where as the adelaideskyhot think his name is has played over 900 games doing it. BIG difference sorry if you don't see this.
