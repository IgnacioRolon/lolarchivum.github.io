I'm relatively sure the riot accounts are allowed to have friend lists just like the rest of us, and are able to maintain them however they see fit.\n\nSome people freely add random players, others don't.  It's important to remember that Rioters are just like the rest of us but likely have significantly higher numbers of random people attempting to add them.  It can be tough to address all of those requests even if you want to, because of time constraints and the fact friend lists can only be 200 people.","replies":[{"poster":"Yasei Doubutsu","date":"2015-03-25T20:56:39.433+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yeah I know, people are still people.\nBut the thought just came to me on how/why they add others.\n\nMaybe because they think that person is chilled or funny.\nWhat reds do is up to them.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Zero Infinity","date":"2015-03-25T11:05:35.161+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I have two reds add; one was for an apology the other for a thank you.","replies":[]},{"poster":"GoldenTomat0","date":"2015-03-25T06:25:52.973+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"you gotta be active in the community I guess.
