I'd take corrupting into nasus and look to bully nasus as much as possible early rather than opting into a farm lane, gp has a decent matchup early with his passive and q harass. Both scale well but nasus hits a tanky point earlier than GP hits his dmg items.\n\nBest advice I could give for lower rank people playing GP:\n- Watch youtube videos how to tripple barrel correctly, make a custom, practice until you can consistently pull it off.\n- Don't play too ham early, if you are even or ahead usually due to scaling this is a big win.\n- Use ur ult for other lanes as much as possible, this is one of the strongest parts of the kit. You can win other lanes for your team by simply paying attention to the map.\n- TP early not late because GP needs time to set barrels.\n\nConsistency is the key, consistent good decisions, consistent good barrel play, consistent good map awareness.","replies":[{"poster":"Yasei Doubutsu","date":"2016-07-04T03:53:31.947+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"That's good advice, Ill link him to what you said.","replies":[]}]}]}
