Walking into every skill shot, cannot CS. Doesn&#039;t build right and blah-blah.\r\n\r\nThere should be a way to make someone lose there banners or drop them, because some people don&#039;t deserve them at all.\r\nWhy be good, when you can just play 25 games is and reach lvl 4.\r\nI find this unfair to those who are actually good at X-Y champions, and have actually mastered them.\r\nbecause now it doesn&#039;t feel like an achievement when a challenger and get lvl 5 on Bard, and a shit bad unranked can also do the same while loosing 100% of his games.","replies":[{"poster":"FideiAngelus","date":"2015-05-20T05:40:08.145+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Why are you judging people by their banners? If someone has a skin, does that make that player amazing at that champion?\n\nHonestly, the champion mastery is there to show people you've played that champion many times. Everyone learns champions at a different pace and at different levels of skill. Just because someone doesn't play to YOUR expected level, doesn't mean they need to be punished for it. It's not like everyone's a challenger","replies":[{"poster":"Yasei Doubutsu","date":"2015-05-20T06:38:00.731+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"1. I said nothing about skins.\n2. Its champion \"Mastery\" key word in that. I can understand that reading can be hard sometimes but try it, it works wonders.\n\nthe whole point of Champion mastery is to show your team that you have mastered that champion.\nIts an achievement, as I have said (If you can read).\nSomeone thats challenger can master Bard lets say and be really good and get lvl 5 as him, and feel like they have achieved something.\nBut some guy thats lvl X or unranked or whatever elo. can do really shit or average (Basically not properly earn it)\nand can reach lvl 5.\n\nIm saying its not fair on those who actually work for there mastery points.\nbecause why bother to master when you can feed intentionally forever and still get the banners for them.\n\nTry to read this this time.","replies":[{"poster":"FideiAngelus","date":"2015-05-20T07:26:12.498+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"No need to make a personal attack mate :)\nThis isn't the Rift so let's keep our salt levels low\n\nI don't understand why anyone would feed intentionally just to gain a D grade mastery points, but if you think someone will do that, I guess there may be some people who would. Honestly, no-one can judge how good you need to be to get Level 5 in mastery points. How will you differentiate a level 5 mastery of a challenger to a bronze? How will the system keep up if you get promoted from bronze to silver to gold? Would you need to redo your Champion Mastery? Honestly, your idea isn't that well thought out practicality wise.\n\nIt's not up to you to judge who is good at what champion. If they have an off day on that champion, do they not deserve their level 5 title? It's a game mate, just have fun and try to get your level 5 masteries and not worry about how \"poorly\" you think someone else is doing, because by the looks of it, if any challenger was to watch you play, you'd be pretty crap and don't deserve a mastery level 5 in any champion","replies":[{"poster":"Yasei Doubutsu","date":"2015-05-20T07:58:33.626+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Point still stands though.\nIts suppose to be an achievement, earning the right to have that banner and that emote.\n Instead of feeding your way through to the top.\n\nMaybe this is where the \"Unskilled\" report comes into play, enough of those on X champs and it might considering dropping your banner.\n\nI know its a new system but I would like to earn my lvl 5 and feel like I have actually achieved something.\nBecause when I see another person play a champion that I love and have lvl 5 on.

Unless you only care about other people knowing you deserve it which really shouldn't matter because who cares what they think, this system is for people to feel good about getting there banner it isn't really about 100% mastering the champ take the name with a grain of salt. All you have to do is feel good about your own banners and not worry about anybody elses.","replies":[{"poster":"Yasei Doubutsu","date":"2015-05-20T09:59:20.791+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"That's a fair point.\nBut I dont think it should \"Feel good\" if they are bad and fed to lvl 5.\nI was just saying, I would feel robbed of my progress to see someone using my champ (hasn't happened yet)\nand then not ward, not peel, not anything and just feed.","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Wumachine","date":"2015-05-20T08:43:02.222+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> I said nothing about skins.\n\nIt's called a fucking analogy, i can understand that english is hard sometimes but try it, it works wonders","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"ShuffledPancake","date":"2015-05-20T08:36:53.271+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"May  i add he used the skin thing as another example of what they do, if he didnt say that before.. yeah dont attack him personally too","replies":[]}]}
