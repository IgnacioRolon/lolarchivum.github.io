Taking TP gives you the ability to fall behind in lane and be fine by being able to back earlier, and also to be able to make plays around the map, whereas Exhaust is going to be rather lackluster until at least 20-30 minutes where grouping starts.\n\nEarly laning: Try to avoid using your Q to CS, focus your auto's on that and this allows you to poke your enemy laner.\n\nLevel 2: I would actually recommend taking E second against an Irelia just in case she try's to all in you early, gives you the ability to jump back and kite her out. (and this was proven by what she did i'm actually typing these as i watch)\n\nLevel 3: you actually had the ability to jump in for a trade, Mega Gnar means your tanky, this means better trading even against an Irelia, instead you jumped in for a CS when you were about to lose mega gnar and lost the trade.\n\nLevel 4: here is where TP would help over the exhaust, you would be able to back and not miss CS with this early miss trade.\n\nLevel 6: you had minion advantage and hit 6 with the transform and a decent window to jump Irelia before she realized and backed up.\n\nEarly buys against true damage: Health > Armor, the armor won't help you as much as the raw health in a matchup like this one.\n\nIrelia's ult: this thing is like on a 60 second cooldown.\n\nLevel 7: here's your chance to freeze the lane, instead you reset it.\n\nLevel 8: either max your Q/W don't split levels.\n\nXin gank: honestly you could have saved the Exhaust if you Q'd and gave her that slow instead.\n\nLevel 9: you warded when Jax was visible bot side, ward wasted for at least 10-15 seconds (and this got swept before it was actually useful).\n\nGetting the 2 CS you probably could have held till you were mini to get your Q off cooldown sooner.\n\nWhen your safe and hard pushing use your E, lesser known thing about the jump is you get bonus attack speed for 3 seconds.\n\nI'm gonna stop watching here cause this post is massive.","replies":[{"poster":"kejitron","date":"2015-09-23T00:32:54.667+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"you must like typing","replies":[]},{"poster":"Yasei Doubutsu","date":"2015-09-12T12:42:19.799+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I like taking exhaust, because as I said.

You wont miss out on sustain by getting Doran's Shield because it has plus 6 health regeneration per 5 seconds. Doran's Blade gives 3% life steal. Even if you had 100 AD levels 1 - 4 say, you would only regenerate 3 health per auto. And since life-steal goes off the damage you deal, you'll get even less health after you calculate in the minion's armour. \nTo make Doran's Blade better regeneration wise, you would have to be able to auto attack 2-3 times every 5 seconds. Which to me indicates that you would be laning quite comfortably and possibly even winning. If you look back to the later parts of your laning phase you weren't able to auto-attack sometimes for up to 15 seconds because she was zoning you.\n\n2. Lets also clear up Irelia's W. You need to know your enemy. She gets passively 5 flat HEALTH REGENERATION (not true damage) as an on-hit effect. Only when activated does she get 15 true damage for 6 seconds.\nThere's actually a lot of evidence suggesting that Doran's Shield blocks damage from on-hit abilities (meaning it would block some of Irelia's W, read more about that [here](http://forums.na.leagueoflegends.com/board/showthread.php?t=3707617) .)\n\n3. But in your defence none of the evidence is official, so even if it didn't block Irelia W, Doran's Shield is still better, here's why;\nWith Doran's Blade you take say 70 damage from her auto-attacks plus 15 true damage. That's 85 damage total.\nWith Doran's Blade you take 62 damage from her auto-attacks plus 15 true damage. That's 77 damage total.\n\nPlus with Doran's Shield you have 10 extra health compared to Doran's Blade, making you slightly tankier.\n\nEssentially if you think you're going to win your lane then take Doran's Blade, but you didn't seem very hopeful at the start and you ended up losing lane. So I think it's worth trying out Doran's Shield against some of these match-ups.","replies":[{"poster":"Yasei Doubutsu","date":"2015-09-12T07:50:27.401+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hmm ok, Ive never actually run the numbers before.\nIts just *According to statistics on third party websites*\nI do 90% better when I start dorans, but when I start shield I lose way more games.\n\nBut that is rather helping so thank you :)","replies":[{"poster":"JasonWazza","date":"2015-09-12T11:49:12.161+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The problem is your not actually considering what these stats actually mean.\n\nIn cases where both Doran's blade and Doran's Shield are viable 9/10 times you will see doran's blade have more win percentage, why?\n\nBecause Doran's Blade is taken into WINNING matchups and Doran's Shield is taken into LOSING matchups.\n\nThis doesn't actually mean that shield is worse, it just means that it's more viable in a bad matchup.","replies":[]},{"poster":"BigLebowski","date":"2015-09-12T09:14:06.880+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"That's interesting actually.
