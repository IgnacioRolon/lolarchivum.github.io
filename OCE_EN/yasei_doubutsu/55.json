Secondly, submitting a ticket is apparently meant to be the *preferred* alternative to reporting bugs, unless the bot handling your ticket isn't yet programmed to know how to actually interpret a bug report and forward it to a red.\n\nAs for the banner not appearing, that's most likely just from the whole implementation being bugged.
