I also noticed your 16:9 video is in 420p, opposed to your 720p in your 4:3 video. I would not lose quality to get your video in 16:9. Ill take it that your video is like this because your not recording at a native 16:9 resolution. If you have a Nvidia graphics card you can get around this via upscaling but that still isn't perfect. For at least making videos i would go back to 4:3 until you can get your 16:9 videos to a higher resolution and without that stretched look. \nHowever, I've been really only talking about the negatives, so here is a few positives. Your audio quality is very high and your commentary is interesting to listen to. Your gameplay is also very interesting to watch. \n\nSorry for the late reply, I've been busy over the last couple of days. \n\n-GL,HF","replies":[{"poster":"Yasei Doubutsu","date":"2015-10-23T01:38:19.848+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yeah, I don't know what happened with that.\nUsually everything I do is in 720P plus, and yeah I don't like it being stretched.\n\nI've giving it a test, but I think Ill just go with the 4:3 visuals and have the small black boarders on the side as it wont look stretched.\n\nAnd the late reply is fine, and thank you?
