I watched it to the end. This is what lowl elo is every fucking game man. It doesn't matter how much you ping, the fucking clowns chase fucking kills over and over. \nSupp farming my jungle, top lane wasting fucking tp to try and kill the enemy top deep and gets caught.\nYou can lead a horse to water but you can't make it drink! If you even get a little bit behind in jg with deaths trying to save them from their dumb plays then they don't listen to you.\nMy game calling skills are not too bad at all having played for six seasons but at 39 years old and suffering cronic chest pain my mechanical skills suffer.\nI end up on tilt watching them run like fucking lemmings into the enemy team.\nMy fucking pet hate is not having a sighstone on supp. I fucking hate it and it puts me on tilt hard.\nIt means as the jg I now have to buy a sighstone and become the supp. \nI have written a post about this but it got downvoted.\nThis match just shows how fucking bad it is a low elo.\nThanks for hopefully opening the eyes of some of the people on this forum to what a headfuck low elo is and why I get so fucking tilted and tocix watching dumb plays.","replies":[]},{"poster":"DannyMac","date":"2016-08-24T12:31:41.432+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"{{champion:33}} ok","replies":[]}]}
