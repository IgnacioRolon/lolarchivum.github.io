If you need champs and are willing to spend that much, go for it.

As should everyone else. No matter the Acc.\nThis way I can better prepare for team synergy or help out more.\n\nMaybe when I play that ACC some more is when I throw more money at Riot.\nThey should start keeping score on who throws more money at them.","replies":[]}]}]}
