Why is that bad?\n\nbecause smart people, like myself, view it in chronological order, which is the way it's supposed to be viewed. in chronological order, the first post is at the top of the first page, and the second post is below it, third below that, until you get to the 21st post, which is the first post on the second page. so its like old forums.\nand in chronological order, when someone uses reply, it only shows the reply, not the original message, unlike when they use quote.\n\nthis is what it looks like when someone uses the boards in the correct way when no one else does\nhttp://i.imgur.com/8FxOdz0.png","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Yasei Doubutsu","date":"2016-04-06T04:17:20.052+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"What do you mean by that?\n(Lemme explain)\nMy boards show some things higher then others, and sometimes not at all.\nAnd for what ever reason (For me)\nWhen ever I hit the reply options it uses the quote options, and quotes for quotes.\nAnd it just shows all messages in a list/line.\nI cant actually see who has replied to who.\nOr even if I have replied.\n(For instance me to you, I hit reply came up with the quote options.
