Not rated for some players.\nWe can brain storm a way to fix that.\n\nAnybody else got some ideas for things like this?\n\nI have suggested a long time ago, that we should be able to \"Pool\" RP.\nI occasionally have like 100 RP that I cannot use, may as well pool it for something.\n\n-Like we, as a community could pool RP. Then riot could do something with that RP-\nMaybe distribute it to summoners that have done some nice things?\nBring modes back?\n\nThat's it for now, but I'm going to list SOME league Youtubers. \n(I cannot be fucked looking for them all- So paste your own Youtube Account or someone else if you wish)\n\nEDIT:\n-= Some of the links are being dodgy and showing incorrect Vids I have no idea why, just a warning.=-\n\n-SOLWOLF-\nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UCJwYjzr3QDzzVmYeQk-Zhkg\n\n-DISCO HEAT-\nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UCUjmqGqianpE3O4p03xD4hg\n\n-SP4ZIE-\nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UCmtQGojT9O2LVzVIVKDGEjw\n\n-THEPEACHPIGEON-\nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UCyiLJaz5a41qi2g0ocjxNeA\n\n-AIGEY-\nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UCyiLJaz5a41qi2g0ocjxNeA\n\n-GBAY99-\nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UCRIxFJ5UicWOUdoUYyJTD1Q\n\n-FOXDROP-\nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UC9U_UPJLasfZYZ0icNI0vBg\n\n-SIV HD-\nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UC3FG_gOPjOiHo1iWLtD1qDw\n\n-SKY-\nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UC7z7QwsK120X7hs7Wqi05aA\n\n-KEYORI-\nhttps://www.youtube.com/user/DissidiusWasTaken\n\n-JAYNEE-\nhttps://www.youtube.com/user/JayneeWasTaken\n\n-UBERDANGER-\nhttps://www.youtube.com/user/UberDanger\n\n-DUNKY-\nhttps://www.youtube.com/user/videogamedunkey\n\nP.S\nI know ive missed a lot of youtubers like Lil-Pichu- Phy-LoL- and those who are already associated with those above.

My personal thought here is that a volunteer program (think Emissaries of the League, Wrenchmen, etc.) would be a really effective way to achieve this, but it definitely shouldn't be limited to YouTubers.\n\nThe volunteer group’s purpose would be to find and reward players that consistently add value to the community and the experience of other players.  This can take many forms from content production (YouTube, particularly insightful forum discussion, etc.) to tournament organizers, even third party site owners.  Players that are part of this group would be publicly recognized for their contributions, and encouraged to help others develop their own community initiatives.  Here are the goals for this program:\n\n1)\tReward players for outstanding community contribution – Recognition and possible resources provided by Riot \n2)\tEncourage players to contribute to the community in their own unique ways\n3)\tMaintain an ecosystem whereby members of this group can use their own experiences and resources to assist other players in their endeavors.\n\nIt's a complicated discussion, for sure, but I feel like there's a lot of value in a long-term program for players of this level of dedication.","replies":[{"poster":"Yasei Doubutsu","date":"2015-03-21T17:03:09.637+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yeah I agree.\nAnd a watchman system is a new and exiting idea.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Sackboy","date":"2015-03-21T15:51:33.175+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":4,"body":"Those YouTubers get paid enough, they don't need Riot's thanks.
