So here's a few things I'm going to need:\n\n+ Could you post a screenshot of the error message?\n\n\n+ Did this just start happening after a recent patch? Or has it been an issue for a long time?\n\n\n+ Can you post your computer's specs? \n You can access you computers specs by right clicking on the windows icon in the bottom right corner, and selecting _\"System\"_ from the menu of options, then screenshot or copy and paste the _\"Device specifications\"_ section. See [this](https://www.sweetwater.com/sweetcare/media/2017/04/Windows-PC-Computer-System-Specifications.gif) gif for help.\n\n\n+ Have you already tried a full repair or reinstalling the game?\n\nMake sure you reply to this comment wit the answers or else I won't get notified!","replies":[]}]}
