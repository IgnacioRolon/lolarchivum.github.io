Then an idea came to mind, why not have a unique cursor for each individual champion? I&#039;m not too sure about for every champions skins as well but just a unique cursor for each champion would be really cool. Maybe have it as unlock-able option after you have reached lvl 7 mastery. I think it would feel much more rewarding once you hit level 7 that way. I think it would also promote people to try play new champs as well. :) I just came up with this idea like 10 minutes ago so I have nothing on this besides what I&#039;ve said but maybe it would be cool if someone came up with concept art or something :D","replies":[{"poster":"Chalze","date":"2016-11-21T05:31:46.429+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Perhaps more customization in terms of cosmetics? That can fair further business for Riot as well.\n\nThough they really need to implement larger cursor sizes because with my MacBook Pro's Retina display with 'high resolution' on League of Legends the cursor size stays scaled and thus becomes insanely small...Riot if you're reading this, look into this","replies":[]},{"poster":"Pelican2013","date":"2016-11-21T00:20:15.670+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Mastery rewards seems like a good system","replies":[]},{"poster":"Bytez","date":"2016-11-20T23:54:00.772+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Haha inb4 new cursor skins are released in the store for RP :P","replies":[]}]}
