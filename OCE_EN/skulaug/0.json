I get that he has to be because of old Galio. but couldn&#039;t you have done something different and saved this for later, like for an ad rework or a new champ. i just see him and think of a Jayce and Vi hybrid.","replies":[{"poster":"Talon12","date":"2017-03-11T13:41:54.396+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Coulda been the aatrox rework. It would sound about right with small edits. Q aatrox flaps his wings and shred them with magic awesomeness. E, aatrox lunges forwards, thrusting his blade into them towards the sky, ult... he has wings for a reason...","replies":[]}]}
