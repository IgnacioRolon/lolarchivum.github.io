I&#039;ve played for quite a few teams, most notably for Immunity/Chiefs as support for the last 2 years before making my move to top lane for SIN at the start of the 2nd split. We&#039;ve had a bit of a disappointing split but look to change that for future events/tournaments.\nI&#039;ve played in 3 international events, those being 2013 Wildcards in Germany, 2013 WCG in China and most recently the IWCI in Turkey, all of these are a big highlight in my life. Having the opportunity of playing with friends and representing your country/region in a game that you enjoy playing was kind of a childhood dream that came true. Before league, I loved playing football (AFL) and played it for about 7 years until gaming took over. \n\nI&#039;m currently studying a Diploma of Information Technology and hoping to eventually get a job with a gaming company like riot (hopefully Riot!) because the amount of effort they put in behind the scenes to make sure everything is working is amazing and I&#039;d love to work with everyone there.\n\n\nYou can support me and my team on twitter @SinRosey @SinOceania. Thank you all for your time!!","replies":[{"poster":"LegendWez","date":"2015-07-11T10:50:32.617+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"whats your fav champ rosey","replies":[{"poster":"Assist Ping","date":"2015-07-11T11:28:21.769+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"My favourite champ would have to be yas right now, super fun to play :))","replies":[{"poster":"Chicken4dinner","date":"2015-07-12T01:41:17.269+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Would a build that focuses on trinity force work on yas?
