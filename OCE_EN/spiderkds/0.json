We all reported him and he tricked us to say we reported him for no reason, even did screenshot for posting on forum! I bet he only post a part of the screen. That&#039;s the behaviour cannot be accepted. I and my friends are all good behavior players, we all got the good behavior gift for past seasons. I just want league of legends can judge this with justice.

However, remember these two things when reporting:\n\n1. Asking other players to report someone actually hinders the affect of your own report. I remember reading somewhere that the tribunal system can detect when you ask other players to report someone. I'm not sure if its entirely true or not, but its something to have in the back of your head.\n\n2. This one may seem obvious, but if YOU are toxic, salty, or guilty of breaking the summoners code then your report may not even been considered by the tribunal system when banning a player.\n\nIf you think that this player went way over the line, and you really feel some justice is in order, then take your report to Riot Support. Just remember that it can take up for a week to receive a response and repeatedly spamming your ticket with 'bumps' will only increase the wait time.\n\nSorry if I came out toxic in my original response, its just us common posters find it frustrating to keep seeing these kind of posts, which quite frankly just don't belong on the boards. (I also thought this was posted in GD, but just saw it in Player Behaviour, I don't know if the naming and shaming rule applies in this part of the boards)","replies":[{"poster":"spiderkds","date":"2017-01-02T23:41:11.901+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thanks for the reply, because this is the first time I post something on the board, I don't really know the rules here, and thanks for letting know about this, I do appreciate. Yes, thanks, I just think that everyone deserves a justice, fair and happy environment to play, it is a game which we should feel happy to spend time on after all. I didn't even realize that here are many people post as the common posters and feel sorry about what I did. Thanks for the help. GL, HF.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}
