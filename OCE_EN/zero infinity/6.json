Summer Challenger teams CANNOT make worlds. Why? Because of the way you can get to worlds from an LCS. Each LCS (EU and NA) have 3 world's slots. The first is taken by the Summer Split winner. The second is by scoring the most Championship points. Championship points are gain by where you place in LCS in each split. The points are as follows.\n \nPlace\tSpring Split\tSummer Split\n1st\t        90\t                Automatic Qualification\n2nd\t        70\t                90\n3rd\t        50\t                70\n4th\t        30\t                40\n5th-6th\t10\t                20\n7th-10th\t0\t                0\n\nThe third spot is taken by gauntlet style, with the teams that score the 2nd-5th points. Example in link. http://na.lolesports.com/sites/default/files/styles/full_width_scale/public/qualifier.png?itok=MMV5R9fS\n\nSince a relegated team cannot place first in the Summer Split, and is ineligible for points, they cannot make worlds. However, Spring Challenger teams can (For example, LMQ last year.)\n\nKorea is pretty similar. Although the LCK is new this year (the setup was different last year, so i don't know how it works exactly)\n\nChina LPL has spring and summer splits. The 3 Spots are - the first is the winner of a Best of 3 between spring and summer champions (if it's the same team it's Auto Qualification) The other 2 spots are the 2 top teams in a tournament between the loser of the previous game, 2nd Spring Split, the 2nd and 3rd in the Summer Split. If the spring and summer split champions are the same, hence no loser, then the 4th team takes their spot and the seeding reorganises\n\nThe GPL (South East Asian region) gets 2 spots. The Summer Split champions Auto qualify and then points system similar to LCS\n\nAnd finally the international wildcard teams win their regional tournament to qualify and then Riot makes it up.","replies":[{"poster":"Zero Infinity","date":"2015-03-31T00:32:19.154+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thanks so much for all the info!\nGreat read.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Turlo","date":"2015-03-27T06:16:18.838+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"which challenger series are you refering to?","replies":[{"poster":"Zero Infinity","date":"2015-03-27T06:54:50.621+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"EU is what I had in mind, but I would't mind hearing all paths to Worlds, is if can be explained succinctly.","replies":[]}]}]}
