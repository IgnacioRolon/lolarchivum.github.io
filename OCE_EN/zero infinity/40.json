It was out WAY before ARAMS. Biggest thing I miss from transferring from NA server to OCE was not being able to play Dominions. Arams are good, but not being able to choose your champion (while not having to do a normal or ranked to do this) is a pain. \n\n Dominions, (and I played over 1000 of them on NA) were fun, and even though enemies could choose whatever champs they wanted, it was a good learning curve to try to counter them. Specially bot lane. I did 50 jayce games in a row and always had teemos at bot. but learn't to counter. \n\nBring the Dominons back please, So much fun. But I am up for the custom game idea. Only problem is hard to get people to join","replies":[{"poster":"Zero Infinity","date":"2015-03-12T20:32:41.428+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Here's the way I see it; \n1. Either they're aren't enough people interested and Riot are justified in not opening the queues yet. \n2. There are enough people and this idea will work. \n\nTry to spread it to your friends and get them to auto join on start up. \n\nAlso I think they're decision to release ARAM over Dom was based on queue popularity in other regions.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"BRAINSICK","date":"2015-03-13T01:11:57.090+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"Trying to create a Dominion game is the worst coz you wait 30 minuets just to see 5 people join and leave the lobby.","replies":[{"poster":"Zero Infinity","date":"2015-03-13T01:18:27.836+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"That's why I'm hoping to coordinate some more.\nAnyone interested should join the group.\nIf you see a few people free we could try and start on, or we can set specific times, \"Like hey anyone want to be on 7 tonight to play\"\n\nI see a lot of people complaining about lack of Dominion, this is a way they can all be in contact and oragnise games among themselves.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"SkarSkarSkarner","date":"2015-03-20T04:48:49.011+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hard to miss Dominion after playing Ascension.
