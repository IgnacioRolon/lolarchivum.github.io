Of course it takes quite a bit of practice to perform well, because you have to be consistently right clicking in a fast rhythm. Attack-swing-move, attack-swing-move, attack-swing-move. A lot of people recommend playing osu to train your orb walking skills, because similarly that involves high-intensity hyper-accurate mouse movements. \n \nOf course you're continually stopping, but usually you'll either have a large movement speed buff (for carries, like yi) or your enemy will be slowed (for brawlers like darius), allowing you to close the gap on your enemy. If you're fast enough, you can actually stay *in front* of your enemy, causing their autopathing to attempt to take them around you, thus making orbwalking even more effective. \n\nRemember, the whole idea behind orb walking is minimizing the amount of time you are stood still aa'ing by cutting off the second half of your attack animation. It's all about timing.","replies":[{"poster":"KingDinger","date":"2014-12-02T05:31:51.685+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"best champ to learn the basics of melee \"orb walking\" is udyr. you can just around someone in a circle and still auto attack efficiently with him once you get good enough. also his animation is so short he can start moving again instantly.\n\nyi is a BAD choice for it, as he is too fast you dont learn anything, you can basically just Q a-move and it does it all for you.","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"locKified","date":"2014-12-05T05:11:52.621+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The key of thumb is to think of the auto attack as three parts, the wind up, the damage point and the cooling down period.\n\nThe wind up refers to the part where the attack starts but hasn't connected yet. The reason why you're cancelling your AAs is that you are moving/cancelling during this period. i.e you are trying to cancel too early\n\nThe period when you SHOULD move is when you reach the damage point which is when the attack has connected.\n\nYou should keep moving until the cooling down period (the period where you are unable to auto attack) and attack again.\n\nRepeat the above and you should be a pro at it soon.","replies":[]},{"poster":"y o","date":"2014-12-03T04:06:21.693+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Just play ranged characters?","replies":[{"poster":"Zero Infinity","date":"2014-12-03T04:30:24.080+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"That's what I've done for four year :S.\nI at least want the opportunity to expand my horizons.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"DÃ¨athClaw","date":"2014-12-02T02:22:11.774+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"While I don't play a large variety of melee champs, I can say it's worth knowing exactly when in the animation the damage appears from a melee attack.

The same thing applies for attacking then moving, a lot of it is champion specific as they all have different attack windups, but if you say particular champions, I might be able to help out more.","replies":[]},{"poster":"She Loves Me","date":"2014-12-01T15:09:00.739+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":4,"body":"***","replies":[{"poster":"Zero Infinity","date":"2014-12-01T15:16:23.801+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thanks for the useful information.","replies":[{"poster":"She Loves Me","date":"2014-12-02T05:16:20.493+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"<3","replies":[]}]}]}]}
