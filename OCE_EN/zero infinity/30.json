Membership*\n- Could have Monthly unlimited access to standard gaming computers (~ $25)\n- Locker hire for the month (~+$5)\n- Team memberships that cover 6 members and 3 sessions in a Team or Party Room per week. \n\n\n*5.Community Socials, Events or Competitions* \n- Could have a variety of fun socials; from cosplays themed parties to everyone playing a crazy custom mode for the night.\n- Local tournaments can be throw and well as other various competitions such as Fan Art .\n\n*6. Pro match viewing*\n- Can watch pro matches in a social environment! Have fun cheering from your team, or synchronised jaw dropping at an amazing game. \n- Can have the hype of grandfinals.\n- Regular LCS watchers can have somewhere to watch game regularly, and like minded people to discuss strategy. \n\n*7. Tutorial for the playing wishing to improve*\n- Can have a range of classes in which anyone can join for $10 an hour class. Max 10 summoners per class. Some significant potion can go the member running the class. \n- Skill tutorial; Mechanics (Basics - CS, warding, securing objectives etc) , Strategy (map rotations, trading objectives, recognising and acting on enemy mistakes), Meta Champions -Who and Why including item paths.\n- Attitude tutorials; how to avoid toxicity, tilt, raging as well as great tips on improving team communications and how to develop a resilient play-style \n- Mich; Learning digital art, or how to cosplay, or how to stream or any other unique LOL skills that you may be able to teach to someone (and that someone would want to learn).\n\n*8.

Cheap and Parent Friendly*\n- Safe happy environment; parent's can have the knowledge of where you are, and that you are indoors (aimed at teenagers mainly) \n- \"Public\" areas prior to entering the computers section in which parents can drop off/pick up as well enjoying a bite to eat and a coffee in either the indoor or outdoor eating areas.\n- Majority of expense can be summed into a monthly payment for parents convenience - perhaps option for payments online.  \n\n*POSITIVE LOL ENVIRONMENT!*\n- Because you know this game isn't just made of rager AFKs and trolls. \n- LOL makes you happy and you wish to meet and play with like minded people\n- Because the LOL community deserve to be rejuvenated. \n\nI want to bring back the humanity, recapture the passion, and teach people can to play the real LOL game!\n\nNote: The image is my first draft, currently working on a 2nd. \n\n\n\n","replies":[{"poster":"JasonWazza","date":"2015-02-08T04:59:54.346+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"\"Location: Australia - Other\"\n\nNow that is half assing it.\n\nAlso there are a few problems i see.\n\n>Hire divided into three sessions; Afternoon 2 pm - 10 pm; Night Owl 10 pm - 6 am and Day 6 am - 2 pm. \n\nI'm sorry this place is ran 24/7?

You realize that if you run a computer all the time it degrades faster?\n>\n>Not to mention this place has to be staffed 24/7, and have enough people coming in to make it viable.\n\nYes the place would be intended to be run 24/7.\nBefore I address your other concerns, this is not uncommon practise for internet cafes;  a great deal of people like to throw all-nighters.\nSecondly I would imagine the cafe would run during day hours only, and the night staff would be about a third of the day. \nWith the less staff, and perhaps other incentives, like discounted team rooms for those sessions.\nAlso I think there is an innate market in university students and casual workers (out of the response I got the for School v. Out-of-School, the split was ~50/50), who would wish to stay up to the early hours of the morning hanging with mates or training particularly if they say have the next morning off. \nIn regards to computer degradation, you mentioned significantly reduced numbers at night, so one would imagine that most of the computers at that time could be switched off. \n\n> \"$25 Monthly Subscription\"\n>This really can't actually be offered, fact is, there might not be a computer free if this is a thing, and it's less then $1 a day, this is probably more then it costs to run the >computers (given your saying good hardware AND internet)\n>\n>This is just one of the many prices that is just flat out too low to be viable.\n\nFrom the survey most of the people interesting would be visiting on a weekly schedule.\n Just to give you an idea of my numbers, so you can decide feasibility with numbers. \nI now imagined this being held in a ~7 story building; it would intended to serve everyone in the city.\nG: The entry is the front desk, for all money issues, main bathrooms change rooms and lockers, cafeteria with table for eating, and a pick up drop off zone for parents or kids to wait. \nU: Underground would be parking of some sort.\n1. The playing 2 internet cafe levels, the first a casual more social environment, screens with game, music, lounges ~100 computers. Random groupings of computers to allow maximum flexibly. \n2.And serious gaming area, say add +$10 to the membership. Have ~ 50 solo spaces, and ~25 duo pods, which can be reserved for coaching function.\n3.The next floor would be training room, Teams Room with 5 comps and a  coach and Party/Group Rooms with 10 comps.\n4.The second last floor would be Viewing area; tournaments/local events, large meetings/parties/. Louges for regular LCS watching. Option for chairs to be placed out for larger events.\n5. The final floor would be an eSports Bar with pustyle food and outside/insie eating area and casual event/LCS watching.\n\nAs to staffing for this; I imagine 2 staffs on front desk, one like a secretary and one designed to be mobile, directing, assisting and helping with sign ups.\nAnd two staff on the casual gaming floor; one permanently on the floor the other roaming all other areas.\n\nWith ~300 playable computers; assuming it's near full on Fridays, Saturday and Sunday (500 possible players, esp if weekly events and monthly tonrys are held0 plus maybe 100 who come only during the week. I think there possibility.\n\nAlso cafe and pub can be rented out for extra secured income. \n\n\n\nI'm tried now so I'm going to bed, if there's any other issue that you wish me to answer specifically just let me know and I'll do it tomorrow.\n\nMy finally note for today;\n- Internet cafes are viable business with several around Sydney; I think a Riot run, LOL themed could be the largest internet cafe of a city. I have no business experince and am intended to get someone who has on board to work out a viable strateergy before pitching to Riot. \n-  Better computers and net for a lot of kids.\n- Higher chance of younger player for instance sibilings being introduced to the game\n- SOCIAL - Can not undervalue you this enough. Lol has the ability to be so wonderfully and you lose this when you play home alone. \n- Positive environment- I know majority of the LOL community is positive and loves this game, let's give us an area to bask in all the happiness LOL can bring; art/cosplays contests, local scrim roster, weekly fun modes played in groups, tutorials, coaching, and so many ways people can unite in their joy of the game!\n\nOnce again, thanks your interest and feedback. \n- Skyprus","replies":[{"poster":"JasonWazza","date":"2015-02-12T07:28:38.005+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Now that i'm not at work (i saw this, this morning but had to head out to work so couldn't do a reply straight away) and i'll just go over the stuff.\n\n>The reason I split location into such narrow fields is because of the information I wanted for the survey.\n\nI was mostly pulling your chain, it's kinda a thing that wouldn't be that hard to put into each state sort of thing though.\n\n>Yes the place would be intended to be run 24/7.\n>Before I address your other concerns, this is not uncommon practise for internet cafes; a great deal of people like to throw all-nighters.\n\nI'm gonna stop here and address this, the main difference is the scale, given what you've said your looking at around about 200 computers (which i will address in a second on it's own), find me a Internet cafe with this many computers and i will instantly drop this point, fact is a internet cafe this size, would have to have several staff (not just like 2-3) and that is where your gonna run into problems.\n\n>Also I think there is an innate market in university students and casual workers (out of the response I got the for School v. Out-of-School, the split was ~50/50), who would wish to stay up to the early hours of the morning hanging with mates or training particularly if they say have the next morning off.\n\nI'm not sure you'd be looking at filling the whole lot DAILY(/Nightly), and honestly given the prices you'd have to try to.\n\n>In regards to computer degradation, you mentioned significantly reduced numbers at night, so one would imagine that most of the computers at that time could be switched off. \n\nYour still talking about 16 hours (longer then your average Computer) and i'll go back to my point from before about 300 computers here, Your average half decent computer is at least $1000, then on top whatever extras that go with it (monitors, keyboards, mice) and that's an easy $300,000 simply for startup, Now your average computer tends to last pretty decently (mostly you'd replace the part) however this one has to go beyond average, fact is given your premise these need GOOD cooling systems meaning it would probably have to run water cooling (another $200 per PC at least), and your aim is to profit from this at some point, and your general system will be running a decent sized power supply (hint this is a long term cost)\n\nNot to mention on top of this is the building, we are looking honestly at a easy several million dollar setup given your specs, and the aim would be to profit, the question is this, do you count skins bought by people as money earned by this business?\n\nIf you do monetarily it's probably viable, otherwise given your numbers it wouldn't be, even if the average person only uses their monthly membership weekly (everyone would logically get this) your looking at people paying $6.25 for use of the computers, and the problem here is what does this have to cover?\n\nWith this you have to cover power, internet costs, hardware costs (probably be right to do over a 2-3 years), council fees for even having the building, staff, and you know paying off your several million dollar setup in general.\n\nThe problem isn't the idea itself (cause let me say this, it is an awesome idea, and it would be awesome if it did go ahead) it's the profitability of the idea (which without taking into account the possibility that people may buy skins because they come to this place is low at best, and unprofitable at worst)\n\nYour biggest bet for making Riot actually consider this, is saying that it would promote the sale of skins and bring new people to league, and honestly while it's not a stretch, i think they'd have to increase your prices a little to even consider the idea.\n\nStaffing wise realistically here is what you need;\n2 Receptionists (G)\nAt least 2-3 staff on the open floors for PCs (1)\nProbably 2 staff for the serious floor (2)\nA couple of staff in (4/5) during any events (realize that these events being NA/EU/Chinese/whatever other place, that these can easily be in the night/early morning hours)\nAt least 2-3 Technicians on call for any problems that may occur with hardware (things are going to break).\nAny staff for any food/bar areas\n\n\nI hope i'm starting to make my original point a little clearer now that i'm pointing out what you have to consider.\n\n>- Internet cafes are viable business with several around Sydney; I think a Riot run, LOL themed could be the largest internet cafe of a city. I have no business experince and am intended to get someone who has on board to work out a viable strateergy before pitching to Riot.\n\nIt easily could be, the question is, is it viable to be a 24 hour one, let alone even be profitable\n\nHonestly i feel bad being the negative person here, cause this idea sounds awesome, sadly i'm just being realistic.","replies":[{"poster":"Zero Infinity","date":"2015-02-25T05:57:30.805+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'm glad you like the idea, and 100% understand where you're coming from in questioning the viability. \nFrom my perspective, if we exclude the initial set-up I think it could be tweaked into being viable (I will do research into size and costs to do this so, but I'm confident it can be done).\n As for the initial set-up I'm hoping I can successful pitch it to Riot; I think there's more value in the idea than just the monetary value.
