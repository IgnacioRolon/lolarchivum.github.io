We could have gotten a proper Dolphin-tailed Nami skin, but instead we get Nami with a stupid hat, an inferior tail and a spatula.\n\nI would like Archduke Nasus and Order of the Banana Soraka a lot more if they toned down the headpieces on the staves. I like the outfits, and they are both almost good enough to work as real skins, but the head of Soraka's staff needs to be more stylised and Nasus's needs to be smaller.\n\nDefinitely Not Udyr is a complete joke, but it is nothing but the joke.
