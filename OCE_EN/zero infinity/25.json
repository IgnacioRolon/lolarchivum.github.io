The message pop-up informing you that you have received honour should state who you received it from. \n2. You should be able to give honour to after the end of game lobby. \n3. There should be in place a rewards system similar to the new Mastery Reward system, perhaps with clear parameters.  \n\nIdeas 1. and 2. will allow you to give back honour to someone who has given to you. I think this is a nice gesture, and I always feel bad when I receive honour but don't give back. Just because I didn't give them honour, doesn't mean they weren't deserving of it. I most people, requeue quite quickly, and as a result never get a chance to honour. \n\nWhile you can argue, \"If you think someone deserves honour make the effort to remember\".\nI would argue that why should a good gesture be so restricted, this is an easy accident, so why not have a solution in place.\nYou should be able to honour, as well as add anyone in your play history.\nPerhaps it could be linked to our online match history, for any logouts or client closes.\n\nI feel this will help promote the giving of honour. \nWhich should be turn help the community want to be more positive, as there's a more likely chance to receive honour. \nThe second thing that will really make people want to engage with the honour system is Idea 3. \n\nAchievable rewards with specific number of ribbon values need to be set out. \nI suggest a system like the following;\n\n* Ribbon earned when 25 honour points have been achieved.\n* All 4 ribbons can be earned and displayed at one time.  \n* Any honour points received are only valid for a month. The idea is small number of honour, but you are required to sustain it over time.\n* Honour earned;\n\n| Requirement| Reward |  \n|-----------------------------|---------------------------------------------|\n| First time honour    |+ 5 Honour Points | \n|Any honour after    | + 1 Honour Points     |  \n| 5 + Honour in 1 game | Bonus + 3 Honour on all    |  \n *Rewards could include summoner icons and limited edition skins. \n\nI feel this will make the Honour System more user friendly and give people motivation to use it.\nPlease leave your thoughts.\nSkyprus.","replies":[{"poster":"JasonWazza","date":"2015-03-19T11:06:06.589+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"A) honoring someone isn't an obligation.\nB) this system promotes abuse to get a few ribbons.\nC) 25 is too low for a 5 First time, 1 there after thing even for monthly (5 man premade first time is 20 points to each person.)\nD) The main thing that should be done to promote it is have the ribbons turn up easier, but over a shorter time frame (and last a shorter time frame without being refreshed)\n\nEG: 30 points in honorable opponent in the last week of playing = honorable opponent ribbon (and it's removed when this is no longer met)\n\nThis would promote more use of it for people who deserve it, and make ribbons not a rare occurrence as they are now.","replies":[{"poster":"Zero Infinity","date":"2015-03-19T12:04:42.559+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"First off I feel you misunderstood and it's biased majority of your comment. \nThe +5 bonus does not refresh every month, it is strictly a one off.  \nAs to the easy number, perhaps 25 a week not a month.  \nIf maintain that if people wish to \"grind\" out game with friends,\ne.g. 25 honour requires 7 game minimum, 6 of which must have 4 other players.\n\nNow if we are talking toxic players choosing to abuse to appear honourable, they would have to 6, 5-man premade groups a week, and make it through to the end without annoying anyone. \n\nIf a toxic player forces themselves into 6 pleasant games a week with friends then I feel it's a good road to recovery and should only be encouraged.","replies":[{"poster":"JasonWazza","date":"2015-03-19T14:56:51.727+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":">The +5 bonus does not refresh every month, it is strictly a one off.\n\nAh right, though i honestly believe that if it was monthly then there would likely be a chat for this shit (once a month go in with 4 randoms who are expected to circle honor).\n\n>As to the easy number, perhaps 25 a week not a month.\nIf maintain that if people wish to \"grind\" out game with friends,\ne.g. 25 honour requires 7 game minimum, 6 of which must have 4 other players.\n\nConsidering I'm probably more \"toxic\" in chat (TS/Skype) with friends anyway (cause we don't care) it's not necessarily that your getting this honor for being less toxic, cause honestly, the honor's i get are when i'm a smartass to the guy that's being a douche.\n\nAnd honestly, 1 game a day where you have to be nice when a lot of toxic people are playing 3+ at the very least isn't all that hard.\n\nI agree that the honor's system definitely need's a change though.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Yuudachi","date":"2015-03-19T07:10:42.132+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"***","replies":[{"poster":"Zero Infinity","date":"2015-03-19T07:57:24.482+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Except I feel the people deserve the honour, and if they've made the effort for me I want to make it back.","replies":[{"poster":"Yuudachi","date":"2015-03-19T08:36:36.075+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"***","replies":[{"poster":"Zero Infinity","date":"2015-03-19T08:40:41.292+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"People are only willing to trade honour for honour if they did not resent eachother after the game.\nAnd to that I say, wurf.","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Daen","date":"2015-03-18T16:33:45.783+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey there!  I'm a NA scrub, but Honor is definitely something into which I have put a lot of thought.  Honor kind of depends on what Riot wants out of the system, and there are two basic trains of thought: \n\n* Fun informal recognition tool\n* Compelling social feature\n\nIf the goal is for Honor to just be fun and informal, your suggestions could potentially be fantastic additions to the system.  If the goal is for it to be a compelling social feature, however, there are some pretty core problems with the system that make even well-thought-out suggestions like this not feasible in maintaining the system long-term.  Here are some of those core issues:\n\n**Honor doesn't really have any checks and balances**\n \nTheoretically speaking, Honor could be considered to be the opposite of reporting; you report someone if they do something bad, you honor them if they do something good.  The main important difference, however, is that reports are checked for validity before being used as a method to discipline the community.  Honor is not checked for validity at any point, and as such it has far less intrinsic value than reporting.\n\nPeople aren't just punished when they reach a certain threshold of reports, they are punished when they receive a certain threshold of *true* reports.  This is not the case for Honor, to my knowledge; if you reach a threshold of Honor value per game, you receive the appropriate Crest.\n\n**Honor is nearly impossible to obtain in many scenarios**\n\nThis one is pretty self-explanatory, but in most game modes people just don't Honor enough for players to overcome the system's Honor value requirement.  Either there needs to be more of a reason to use Honor *correctly* or there needs to be a lower baseline to obtain Crests.\n\n**Honor directly incentivizes misuse in certain situations**\n\nThis one could be pretty long, so I'll TLDR.  It's very easy to honor people for playing well or to just honor random people based on whim, and unlike reporting this still retains weight in the calculation of Crests.  It's also much easier/faster to obtain Crests by cheating/trading for Honor than it is to just be a good person.\n\n**Honor value calculations don't match the actual numerical display of the Honor obtained**\n\nThis one is mainly an aesthetic annoyance for me, but it bothers me that the Honor people give is not necessarily worth what the game says it is.  If I Honor random people constantly, the value of the Honor I give out is low.  If you Honor only people that truly deserve it, the value of the Honor you give out is high.  \n\nFrom the perspective of the game/visual appearance, our Honor is worth exactly the same (+1 Honor).  From the perspective of *calculation*, yours is worth significantly more than mine (e.g. +1.6 Honor vs +0.4 Honor).  This discrepancy doesn't necessarily affect the function of Honor, but it makes it seem somewhat inaccurate.\n\n**Honoring premades/friends makes very little sense, as a general concept**\n\nI know this is very controversial, but to me it seems weird that premade players can honor each other.  If I queue up for a game with someone, I *expect* them to be honorable.  This comes down to what Riot wants the system to be, but personally I envision Honor as a way for the community to be more awesome when dealing with random people.  I don't see a ton of value in allowing friends to one-up each other, but I *do* see a ton of value in allowing the players to let each other know what they like and dislike.\n\n---\n\nI know this seems really negative, but that's not my intent at all.  Let's chat about the suggestions you made!\n\n>The message pop-up informing you that you have received honour should state who you received it from.\n\n> You should be able to give honour to after the end of game lobby.\n\nI've been back and forth on this, but ultimately I think I disagree.  My mind can still be changed!\n\nI feel that being able to give Honor in-game would be a better time than after the game is over, mainly because of hindsight bias; it's a lot easier to look back on a game and over-consider small positive or negative actions than it is to do so right in the moment.  I also don't really feel that Honor trading is particularly valuable, especially if the only reason it's happening is because another player gave you Honor so you want to Honor them back.\n\n> There should be in place a rewards system similar to the new Mastery Reward system, perhaps with clear parameters.\n\nI agree here, though I think some of what I detailed above needs to be resolved before things like this happen.  There is a huge open space to explore as far as Honor rewards are considered, but it relies on the system being accurate enough to be useful as a true social endeavor.\n\n---\n\nOverall, great thread!  I'd love to hear your thoughts on my thoughts, so that I can provide my thoughts to your thoughts on my thoughts.\n\nNo?\n\nI'll see myself out.","replies":[{"poster":"Zero Infinity","date":"2015-03-18T22:49:52.461+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I would love to give my thoughts on your thoughts, to received your thoughts on them again!\nAnd welcome to OCE, nice to have you wander over. \n\nI will attempt to address as many of the issues you made as methodically as a I can.\nI feel the system I devised addresses a lot of them, but it the context of how I believe the honour system should be utilised.\nSo I guess that's where I'll begin.\n\n- First off, honour is a GOOD thing, and should not be discouraged in any form\n- I have recently taken a very polarised view to the community; you're either negative/toxic or you positive whether passively or actively . \n- Even if a player is neutral, why not reward them for not contributing to the negativity. I feel honour should be a free flowing resource to help identify non-toxic players. \n- If players want to queue together, have a good game and honour each, who cares! They're enjoying the game is a positive way give them honour.\n- To further reward people who get more honour from strangers, have a first time honour bonus. +5 honour points v. +1 for regular honours.\n- Introduced decay of honour after a month so that earning of honour is always relevant\n-  In this way honour becomes a grindable quest. The most efficient method is to have 5 strangers honour you in one category within a month. The least efficient should be queueing with friends 25 times for the honour. \n- Both ways are achievable and this in itself means that people will be more willing to engage with the system promoting it's use.  \n- If a players gets any sort of ban all their honour should be wiped in a hard rest.\n- Value of honour should not be a secret formula nor depend how much you honour v. how much you've been honoured. It should be transparent and easy. \n- Limited skin should be rewarded for keeping up honour badges for a certain number of days without letting dropping say for 100 days or so. Since anyone banned would have a wipe they wouldn't be eligible for the more long-term rewards. \n- In regards to trading and after game skins, I'll repeat; giving honour is good and should not be discouraged but encouraged in any way possible.\n- If someone gives you honour and you see after you left the end of game lobby, why can't you give it back? If someone does something nice in real life, I'd always try and say thanks and do something of equal nice value back. Why shouldn't this be the same. If two people want to have this pleasant interaction, to which the only ulterior motive is a banner, why the hell not! \n\nTL;DR: I believe giving of honour should be easy and encouraged. There is nothing wrong with giving to friends or as a thanks back, and anyone who is not negative deserves honour IMO. +5 HP for a first time giver, means there is higher reward for earning honour off strangers, compared to friends who would earn +1 HP.  Decay will encourage regularly interaction with the system to maintain the honourable status.","replies":[{"poster":"Daen","date":"2015-03-19T16:25:02.064+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":">First off, honour is a GOOD thing, and should not be discouraged in any form\n\nThis depends on what you mean by discouraged.  I agree with the premise, but preventing abuse is not discouragement.\n\n>I have recently taken a very polarised view to the community; you're either negative/toxic or you positive whether passively or actively .\n\nHmm.  Do you feel we should be rewarding all non-negative players equally regardless of contribution to overall community health, or rewarding actively positive players in a different way?\n\n>If players want to queue together, have a good game and honour each, who cares! They're enjoying the game is a positive way give them honour.\n\nI addressed this in another comment of yours, but it comes down to ideology.  I think it's great for players to do this if the system is intended to be somewhat superficial, but if we want a true social tool it would likely need to be more regulated to prevent abuse.  This is especially true if you'd like to add additional reward/incentive to the system, because it's already very easy to abuse.\n\n>To further reward people who get more honour from strangers, have a first time honour bonus. +5 honour points v. +1 for regular honours.\n\nHonor is not currently awarded on a points scale, it's based on a ratio of how often you honor the correct people.  Someone that's more accurate has more value in the system, whereas someone that's less accurate has less of an effect.\n\n>Introduced decay of honour after a month so that earning of honour is always relevant\n\nThis is one point in which I very much disagree.  I don't think that players' positive contributions should ever be lost to the vacuum of time, especially in a system that is meant to reward long-term positivity.  There is technically already Honor decay, because it's based on a ratio of games over time.  If you fall below the threshold, you have decayed.\n\n>If a players gets any sort of ban all their honour should be wiped in a hard rest.\n\nIf I'm not mistaken, this already happens.\n\n>Value of honour should not be a secret formula nor depend how much you honour v. how much you've been honoured. It should be transparent and easy.\n\nI agree, but it's also difficult to implement a system with high clarity, high accuracy, and low potential for abuse.  How would you propose doing so?\n\n>There is nothing wrong with giving to friends or as a thanks back, and anyone who is not negative deserves honour IMO. \n\nThis is very much a matter of opinion, and I completely respect yours.  Personally, I feel that actively positive players have a much more significant impact on others' experience than neutral players; it seems odd to me that the same reward system is used for both.  In our daily lives, we encounter hundreds of people that provide a neutral experience to us (driving by, sitting on a park bench, etc.).  Are each of these interactions something that warrants a reward for that person?","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Project Xayah","date":"2015-03-19T08:11:29.173+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> The message pop-up informing you that you have received honour should state who you received it from.\n\nPretty sure one of the ideas behind it being anonymous is that people wont feel obliged to honour people who have honoured them.\n\n> You should be able to give honour to after the end of game lobby.\n\nDecent idea. As you said it might slip a persons mind to honour someone, especially if they get caught up on tactics in-game. I think it could be worth it to have an option in the \"recently played\" section of you \"friends\" tab to honour people.\n\n> There should be in place a rewards system similar to the new Mastery Reward system, perhaps with clear parameters.\n\nSome potential there, though consideration would need to be taken into account for pre-mades since it could be abused.

To address \"abuse\" which I don't think is a valid name for have fun game and honouring friends, make the first honour you receive from someone have a bonus.
