Opinions?","subforum":"Gameplay & Strategy","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"So I just found out about a concept called Mandrake wards, that are being experimented with:\r\nhttp://boards.pbe.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/champions-gameplay-feedback/Gvu9AMil-experimental-wip-33-mandrake-ward\r\n\r\nIn short, they cost as much as a pot and when you consume them, they send a little Mandrake to borrow into your brush for 2 mins. Although blind, it will ping you when it senses an enemy; this also works on invisible targets like Eve! \r\nFor anyone still trying to learn map awareness this would be great, as it's sort of a bridge between no vision and that ward you placed but never look at. \r\n\r\nCan any think of some cool higher level plays that could be made?\r\nWill Lee Sin be able to stock up on these now; could you use them as scout?\r\nAnd I guess another major consideration, should and how can they be destroyed?","replies":[{"poster":"NewTronix","date":"2015-03-12T09:25:43.715+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"All I know is that it's gonna be OP in bronze because nobody has any map awareness anyways xD","replies":[]}]}
