By level 30 most players should have at least more then half if not all champions.\r\nSo why are we getting champion shards everytime we level up? They are pointless to people who own all the champions.\r\n\r\nAnd yeah sure you can trade them for blue essence but you cant really buy anything with the blue essence except more champions... (again pointless if you own them all) I don&#039;t need a name change, i dont need more rune pages, i dont need to server transfer, and i cant buy anything else with blue essence so whats the point.\r\n\r\nThere is no push for me to level up because i don&#039;t get anything rewarding out of it, And in this game (especially in its current state) people need incentive to keep playing otherwise it&#039;s going to die, the gameplay isn&#039;t as good or as fun as it used to be, even normal and aram are too competitive to be fun, it&#039;s more toxic then ever and the balancing in this game is a joke now. \r\n\r\nRiot need to make some changes and fast.\r\n\r\nalso as a side note,\r\nTWO WEEKS OF &quot;ALL RANDOM&quot; URF?? WTF WERE YOU THINKING RIOT.\r\nall random my ass.\r\nwe want bans in urf, i dont care if its still all random, we want bans.","replies":[{"poster":"QAPLA","date":"2018-07-13T01:46:19.274+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The only way you'd have that many champs by level 30 is by spending real money. This is a way for f2p players to gain things at a rate that will keep them playing.\n\nYou can't buy everything with RP and then complain that champ shards/BE are useless, that's like some rich person complaining about minimum wage jobs not being worth doing.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2018-07-12T14:42:31.166+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Such is the purpose of the Essence Emporium: https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/115014872088-The-Essence-Emporium-FAQ\n\nThey'll be doing the special BE shops once or twice a year for all those people who have way more blue essence than champs to spend it on. It's a chance to get RP content for BE, and also a big thing to save up for if you want something like URFwick or gemstones.","replies":[]}]}
