It's fucking terribad. It starts getting good about high silver but even then they still make some bad choices in plays.\n\nLike I had a Riven top against me, she was silver 2 and playing very safe because I was outplaying her but her bronze 2 jungle kept trying to gank me, dying and feeding me, he then called her a noob. He lost the game hard, after the game the riven was explaining how she was duo queue with the adc which wanted to jg. \nMassive difference in game play between b2 jg and s2 top.\nit just gets frustrating watching people play this game with no fucking idea what they are doing. It's worse in ranked because you lose LP and mmr because of them.","replies":[]},{"poster":"ezpenta1234","date":"2016-08-21T05:46:05.594+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":2,"body":"3.
