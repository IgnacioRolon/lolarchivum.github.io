In each of these situations I have issued reports, as instructed. I want to make clear that I&#039;m not here to witch hunt specific players or seek some sort of sympathy, but I genuinely want to understand more about how the reporting system is actually functioning and have a discussion around that.\n\nBack in the day, we had the tribunal, where things were looked at a lot more in a manual process. As the game expanded, I completely understand the need for automation, so this is more the focus of what I&#039;m looking to discuss. With the rise in numbers of players that are intentionally losing games, I have noticed a severe lack of punishment for very clear instances of players intentionally throwing games. Perhaps I&#039;m wrong here, but the only issued punishment for these offences is temporary/permanent account suspension?\n\nI&#039;m curious as to what the process is from here before punishment is actually distributed. How are the systems defining when and where a player deserves a punishment? Are any of the following scenarios used to determine a conclusive (or very strong suspicion in a) breach of the summoners code?\n* Player receives X number of reports \nPlayer receives X percentage of other players reporting them in one game instance\nPlayer receives reports in X percentage of games played *\n\nOn to the link I have attached. There is also clearly an automated punishment system in existence, which is _not_ based upon player reports. The only reason I know this, is because I was issued a &quot;You are now ineligible to earn loot due to leaving or AFK behaviours&quot; notification after a game where I had 3 players on my team run it down mid as soon as we loaded in, for 8 minutes (where the game ended). Now on this note, this was the first game in _at least_ 18 months where I have gone AFK in a game. I cannot remember the last time I went AFK in a match. Whilst whether or not going AFK in this situation is somewhat debatable; to receive automated punishment after just one instance where the stats recorded indicate beyond doubt that I broke the summoners code, seems rather interesting.\n\nSure, someone going AFK is very easily detectable and can not be confused for something else. I understand the difference between being able to clearly distinguish something such as AFK&#039;ing, whilst not always being able to distinguish a player having a rough game and someone intentionally trying to lose. But that doesn&#039;t mean that someone intentionally trying to lose _isnt always_ easily distinguished by an automated system, right?\n\nTake, for example, a player loading into the game, teleporting to midlane, flashing towards the enemy tower and dying very shortly into the game. They then respawn, click straight down the middle of the map once again and die under the tower. Repeat.\nI&#039;m sure most of us have witnessed this, or something similar happen.\n\nThere are so many ways to discern via stats alone, that a player is not just having a rough game, they are very intentional about losing a match. I&#039;m sure there are far more signs of a player potentially losing a game on purpose, but here are some examples:\n* Large percentage of damage taken per death is done by enemy towers\nMultiple deaths _very_ early into the game\nTime between deaths is abnormally short\nItems may be very abnormal (mobi boots rush, we&#039;ve all seen this before)\nVery low damage dealt to enemy champions per death\nAbnormally low gold income\nAbnormally low damage dealt to minions\nStrange selection of summoner spells (ghost/cleanse combo)\nAbnormally high deaths per minute\nHigh number of wards placed inside tower true vision range\nSummoner spells repetitively being used on cooldown\nMovement direction almost constantly in one direction without deviation *\n\nAssuming said player is experienced with hundreds of games under their belt, how many of these triggers would need to be detected in conjunction with one another before an automated system could conclusively determine a player to be intentionally losing rather than having a bad game / being on tilt? \n\nAre any systems to automate punishment for these offences at all in progress or in discussion? Does a player need a report case built up against them the be proven beyond doubt before being issued a punishment? And are these punishments then completely automated based solely on player reports? Or are these punishments issued manually after triggering a certain point requiring further investigation?\n\nAlso, at what point do players who are filing reports come under this category?\n> Players who attempt to abuse the system with false reports are flagged and their reports are ignored.\n\nAll players are going to have different standards of what they think are right/wrong when filing a report for things such as verbal abuse. If one player sends reports regularly for players being verbally abusive with no ill-intentions of abusing the system, does that then exempt their reports from being counted when they send one for a player intentionally feeding or griefing? How many players who are genuinely attempting to help reduce toxicity in the community will end up being thrown into this category, perhaps by simply being trigger happy with players who flame?","replies":[{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2018-04-03T10:37:58.538+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'll try to keep it relatively simple because it can get pretty complicated at times. This'll probs still end up fair long though so bear with me.\n\n**tl;dr**\n\nGameplay offences do get punished, but it's a slow process (much slower than anyone would like) largely due to confidence in identification. \"Go eat a bag of dicks\" is pretty obvious, but 0/10 could mean any number of things\n\n___\n**Reports:**\n\nIt only takes one report to trigger a review of any given game, and only one valid report to issue punishment (or in the case of no punishment, a negative 'mark' against the account). \n\nReport weight used to be a thing (where false reporting a lot would reduce the effectiveness of all your reports) but this is no longer the case.\n\n___\n**Punishment triggers:**\n\nNot every valid report will trigger a punishment, nor will a particular number of 'marks'. 'Marks' (in quotes because it's not an official term of any kind, just the easiest way to reference) are essentially an indicator of negative history on the account. For example while one game might have been borderline, and therefore didn't result in a punishment, it will contribute to the decision to punish or not the next time that account is (validly) reported.\n\nWhat effect a 'strike' has appears to be variable by offence and consistency, as you will see some players with many valid but minor (annoyance type) reported offences that slowly add up, compared to some players that will have something that *just* doesn't get them punished which then pushes the next report over.\n\nAn accounts standing can also have an apparent effect on this process. An account that has never been negative in 5 years of activity is gonna get a lot more leeway than an account that has had three punishments in 1 year of activity.\n\n___\n**Punishments for gameplay offences:**\n\nGameplay offences will net you an instant 14 day punishment (or perma if you have had a recent 14 day ban). Typically punishments follow 4 tiers (10 game chat restriction > 25 game chat > 14 day ban > perma ban), but since a chat restriction obviously makes no sense for a gameplay offence, these punishments will skip those tiers. The reason gameplay punishments seem so rare or ineffective sometimes lies in identification.\n\n___\n**Identification of offence:**\n\nThere aren't many reasons to say 'x racial slur' that shouldn't result in some form of consequence, while the same isn't quite true for going 0/10. It's entirely possible for a player having a bad game to have the exact same stats as a player who started of playing normally and decided to intent feed halfway through. Of course someone who runs it down mid from champ select is a different can of worms, and those players get banned pretty dang quick (there's a few posts here from players punished for a first offence). \n\nThe issue is that most intent feeders *aren't* running it down mid from champ select. Most intent feeders do it because someone said something they didn't like, or the team didn't play the way the want or some other entirely questionable reason that doesn't come up until the game is well under way. \n\nA lot of intent feeders (I would even tentatively say the majority) are intent feeding between playing the game to piss of someone in particular, or as a shit way to vent frustration, or after the game is already going downhill for the whole team and there are other plausible explanations for dying 10 times.\n\nEven if a player has bad scores on a consistent basis, it doesn't mean there is intent feeding involved, though typically you'd see this with new accounts. For those players of a significantly lower skill than their MMR, there's no means to ultra rapidly drop that MMR. They'll drop fast, but they'll still be playing a lot of bad games before they drop to their appropriate MMR.\n\nThe result of all this is a lack of confidence in what constitutes a valid report for this behaviour. Are they actually intent feeding, or was it just a bad game?\n\nI'll also just quickly address these specifically:\n\n>Large percentage of damage taken per death is done by enemy towers **- especially in lower skill brackets many players don't know how to play from behind/succumb to greed a lot, this can easily be attributed to tower dives gone wrong**\nMultiple deaths very early into the game **- getting cheesed by the jungler early, versing someone just better than you, especially if you are playing into a bad matchup**\nTime between deaths is abnormally short **- jungle focus, enemy powerspike, snowballed**\nItems may be very abnormal (mobi boots rush, we've all seen this before) **- if the account is new they could just be bad, for older accounts it's a bit more of an obvious indicator**\nVery low damage dealt to enemy champions per death **- just being behind will do this, especially if your whole team is behind, and especially if you're in alow damage role like tank or support**\nAbnormally low gold income **- again can simply be a result of being behind, support role, or being counter jungled**\nAbnormally low damage dealt to minions **- support role, stomped in lane, jungle focus**\nStrange selection of summoner spells (ghost/cleanse combo) **- can just be off meta picks though ranked is diff, same principle as weird items**\nAbnormally high deaths per minute **- being behind, getting snowballed, getting focused by the jungler etc**\nHigh number of wards placed inside tower true vision range **- obvious, but not a very common one**\nSummoner spells repetitively being used on cooldown **- again obvious but not very common, and on it's own not a significant indicator that something is up**\nMovement direction almost constantly in one direction without deviation **- same deal, obvious but also obviously avoided by anyone with more than no care**\n\n___\n**Actioning punishments:**\n\nIn depth manual reviews (i.e watching a replay) would obviously reveal the truth, but they're also incredibly time consuming. The automated system isn't confident enough to punish many first time or few time offences. Tribunal had it's own host of problems that rendered it essentially useless. So what then is the solution?\n\nThat's the kicker isn't it. The automated system can punish for gameplay offences, but takes quite a while (read: far more offending games than anyone would like) to do so. Manual reviews just aren't sustainable over the population and number of reports (especially given the many people who report for intent feeding anytime someone has more than 5 deaths). Tribunal almost universally punished too harshly and thus required almost complete manual (Riot) review anyway.\n\nWe've ended up with a sort of hybrid, where those reported for intent feeding a lot, but aren't being actioned by the automated system will be manually reviewed, in addition to the normal function of the automated system and random manual reviews. There are other reasons cases/reports can be referred for manual review as well but I won't pretend to know all the details there. The minutiae are somewhat vague (to an extent intentionally so to prevent people from dodging punishments).\n\nThis doesn't result in too many false positives (though I have no doubt they come up from time to time) but also slow and not terribly efficient punishments.","replies":[{"poster":"S T 3 V 3","date":"2018-04-03T17:49:20.025+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Thanks for the very detailed reply - much appreciated :)\n\nI want to keep diving into the hybrid solution in a different manner. Currently, it seems like the process to determine and punish players requiring it is far from efficient, as you eluded to. Obviously, there would have been a ton of work put in to this but I'm still not sure why there aren't more effective and efficient ways to determine gameplay offences. (Hybrid between data detection + player reports)\n\nWith the list you replied to, noting the issues with each point individually; my purpose of laying these out was not as individual triggers, but a combination of many and also as stated only in the case of clearly experienced players (to wipe out quite a few of the basic learning obstacles, is tower damage).\n\nWhen this list is applied only to experienced players and you begin to tick multiple boxes (again, I'm aware that they each mean nothing on their own), surely you can start to automate flagging for potential issues alongside manual reports to assist in speeding up punishment where it's required, right?\n\nEven for mid game offences, where the individual only gets triggered after a certain point and begin a to intentionally feed/throw, I know the data is available to detect such behavioural patterns, is it not just a matter of finding the right pointers hidden within the data? I'm sure upon analysing games where there have been confirmed gameplay offences, patterns in the data would arise that can surely be distinguished from players having a rough game, or well out of their depth in MMR. \n\nAs a programmer who is interested in analytics, I can't sit here thinking there isn't a better solution out there.","replies":[{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2018-04-04T01:21:05.645+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"You're welcome!\n\nI am however, not a data analyst, and personally wouldn't know what I'm looking for, nor what exactly Riot's system already detects. I can really only give you a qualitative answer to (in the case of the automated detection) a quantitative issue. The fact that what Riot detects isn't public also doesn't exactly help us player side work out what they could be doing better, or what we think would work but in fact is already in effect etc etc.\n\nThey are of course not public to prevent abuse of the system, but it makes it somewhat difficult to speculate.\n\nMy point of responding directly to your list of indicators was really just to give perspective. You could be ticking 7 of those boxes just by being behind. We've all had at least one game where we've gone 0/10 for whatever reason, usually because the enemy is better and there is tilt involved. I think we can all agree we shouldn't be banned for those games.\n\nUltimately an automated system can only identify indicators of intent and not intent itself, while manual review just isn't efficient or sustainable. I imagine that yes, there are combinations of factors that would (and/or do) result in a confident assessment of intent, but we don't know how nuanced that may be, or how easily all that data is combined into something accurate and scaleable.\n\nYou could tick two of your boxes and be fairly confident that there was some intentional shenanigans going on, but you could also tick 7 and not be confident at all, so it's not as simple as checking x number of boxes, they have to be weighted differently or something of the like. The problem there is that the detection has to be broad enough to catch a wide variety of intent feeders, but specific enough to avoid detecting people who are just bad.\n\nThe biggest issue with this detection (so far as I can tell) is the sheer variety of intent feeding (and of course gameplay offences in general). Running it down mid is one thing, but actively playing the game to an acceptable degree with occasional intentional deaths thrown in for salt is another. The second is somewhat less severe (but can still completely ruin a lane for someone and a game in general) but substantially harder to detect and action data wise.\n\nLike I said though, I'm not and never have been any sort of data analyst and a lot of the detailed information is intentionally obscured so there's only so much I can say before any claim or speculation becomes completely baseless.","replies":[{"poster":"CyanShinobi","date":"2018-04-06T08:29:16.414+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"This conversation is really interesting and I hope it picks up and is noticed by the RIOT devs.\n> [{quoted}](name=Seras Dragon,realm=OCE,application-id=T8eq2lFQ,discussion-id=7WEIAUEn,comment-id=000200010000,timestamp=2018-04-04T01:21:05.645+0000)...

I think we can all agree we shouldn&#x27;t be banned for those games.\n\nYou answered yourself in that statement. Yes, we've had _one _ game, where due to not being our best we go 0/10 and maybe tick a couple of those other \"boxes\". However, not consistently, game after game. I actually had a game last week, where the enemy mid lane akali kept running down lane and letting me kill her because she \"wanted the account banned and it was taking too long\". However, half way through the game started roaming and playing properly to make it look like she hadn't done anything wrong.\n\nAnother thing with the perma banning. You're cutting the head of the hydra. Instead of banning the account, the IP address needs to be banned. It's not that hard. Most other online multiplayer games do it. This way, you locate the problem, cut it off at it's source, and all other accounts attached to it also die. I understand that would be hard in public places, but I'm sure there would be a way for the owner of the public venue to be notified of particular toxic behaviour, so they can ban that trouble maker from the premise. If \"but this doesn't bring us money\" rebuttle springs to mind, these multi-account, toxic players are actually making you lose money and time and actual players that have and will invest time and money into LoL.\n\nAlso, with the \"Hybrid\" concept, the automatous route is too vague understandably, and the manual one is inefficient and time and man power consuming. Why not have the player base help? I'm sure this has been brought up before? Have players with a high honour score and none to minimal reports against them look through a few cases. I would sure be up for the task. Then after 100 reports that get successfully analysed and put through (via a peer report system so that you can't just deny all requests) you can get a chest or something.\n\nJust my 2 cents ^_^","replies":[{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2018-04-06T11:07:59.170+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":">You answered yourself in that statement. Yes, we've had one game\n\nLoss streaks happen. I've seen players on 10 or 20 game loss streaks. Sure you could argue they shouldn't keep playing if they're that tilted (if only for their sake and not everyone else's) but that doesn't mean it's intentional. Tilt and negligence, sure, but not necessarily anything malicious. My point was there's too much variation, and too much similarity number wise between malicious and non-malicious behaviour.\n\n>Instead of banning the account, the IP address needs to be banned. It's not that hard.\n\nIt's not about difficulty. IP bans have been brought up a lot, and they pretty much always get shot down for the same reasons. Communal and Dynamic IPs. \n\nCommunal IPs mean an IP ban on one player, could affect an entire university campus, or hotel, or family home. I can almost guarantee you the person who got banned isn't going to be the one most affected in almost all of those cases. It's not as easy as just saying \"this person with possibly no information connecting them to any particular student/member/etc of your establishment did a bad thing, remove him\" because that just isn't possible. Even if it was that easy to identify a particular player, how many League friendly venues are there do you think? Every school, every university, every hotel/motel/hostel, every internet cafe.\n\nDynamic IPs mean IP bans aren't going to be effective a lot of the time, because x player can just restart their router and hey presto they've subverted it. Hardware bans are also only so effective (shared or communal PCs, that PC gets sold etc)\n\n>Why not have the player base help?\n\nThat's essentially what tribunal was, and it didn't go well. It's one of those things that sounds good in principle but *really* didn't work out in practice. Tribunal almost universally punished too harshly and required almost complete manual review anyway. It ended up essentially creating *more* work for Riot's already strained manual reviews.\n\nHaving rewards for tribunal was one of the final nails in the coffin that corrupted it completely.\n___\n\nBelieve me everyone wants a better system, but all the obvious solutions have been thoroughly considered or tried before and just didn't work out.
