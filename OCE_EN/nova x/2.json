This need to be talked about and I haven&#039;t found any talk or action taken about this subject. Now the toxicity in league of legends is so disgusting, i don&#039;t even know how people can keep playing.  Now i know and clearly understand that there is a punishment system in place but this punishment system is so useless, did you know riot and summoners, that i could screenshot the abuse i receive take it to a police station and you could be arrested and charged with cyber bullying and abuse online, not even kidding. But do you know what cuts me even deeper is not when i receive it but when other people do. For example i play with my little brother, now im 19 an adult, you know this abuse shit i just mute straight up, but my little brothers are 10 and 12 and they love league of legends so when their is another say 19 year old out there that rages swear s at them curses them abuses them for say dieing IN A FUCKING NORMAL BLIND PICK it drives me straight up the wall and the one time i retaliated and I GOT THE FUCKING 2 WEEK BAN and i saw my brothers playing with the same person....... RIOT. For the younger generation this is disgusting, if i went up to ANYONE IRL and called them a fucking noob and raged and verbally abused them id be locked away by the police. Like YOU NEED TO FIX SOMETHING my advice for this is PERM-BAN IN GAME CHAT. I cant mute the entire teams and still communicate and work with them. I know that others can mute but some don&#039;t do it and hold out for the 1% of chat that helps the teams. but its still being seen buy young people... now realistically there is a legal age restriction M i think over here in Aus. And i know young people shouldn&#039;t be playing it if its classed for older people, but realistically the actual age of players range from 7-100. so the chat abuse and rage is affecting younger children. And as said would you scream and swear and curse and threaten a 8 year old, or talk like that near an 8 year old.....No? you say. Well why does the rage happen.\r\n\r\nRiot the solution&#039;s to these problems\r\n\r\n* PERMABAN the in game chat, reason for this all the duos out there are using headsets over the net communication. so having the chat is literally quite useless as no one usess it but for sending abuse to the other team and their team mates literally no one uses it for anything else. \r\n\r\n* Their needs to be a system that instantly analyses the chat, their should be a list of swear words and words used in conjunction and if their s more than 5 abusive curse words 5x 20 min bans should be applied. you wont lose players ive played through 1,000,000 5x20 in bans.\r\n\r\nRIOT PLEASE READ THIS AND SUMMONERS THIS NEEDS TO BE READ AND APPLIED TO YOUR IN GAME, for the current generation we need to make this a non-abusive, non-negative, but Positive and a great gaming community.\r\n\r\nI&#039;ll be waiting out the next 2 weeks and your ban system does work but its not working as often on the actual abusive people \r\n\r\nmy 2 cents on the subject i just think something needs to be said and brought up\r\n\r\ncheers\r\nIHAKANZ {{champion:412}}","replies":[{"poster":"JasonWazza","date":"2015-08-30T03:52:40.364+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"\"I'm not using the mute button, therefore riot has to do something\"\n\nEDIT: as an extra thing, you can't complain about young people seeing this, either they are 18, or they have permission from a parent, or they are violating the T&C.","replies":[{"poster":"Nova X","date":"2015-09-01T10:48:12.945+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"1.
