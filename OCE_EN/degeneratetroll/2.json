I just don&#039;t care about being a &quot;nice&quot; player, I&#039;ll insta lock every game because I only have a few champs I&#039;m familiar with and I&#039;m 100% going to feed or afk till end or log out and log into another acc if i&#039;m stuck in a game with smurfs.\r\nFix matchmaking and stop encouraging negative shit like this ffs, not hard.","replies":[]}
