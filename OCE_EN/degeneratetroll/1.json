I&#039;m new to lol but so far every ones just as toxic as each other, i&#039;ve maybe had 2/50 or so games i&#039;ve played in pvp agianst real new players and not try hards who cheat the match making system by using smurf accounts. I&#039;m not playing cheaters so i&#039;ll feed and afk untill I have to make a new account ..... but why? Riot needs some back bone so they can man up and punish these scum and let new players learn and not force them to afk or surrender ect.","replies":[{"poster":"Lord Sesshomaru","date":"2017-08-06T20:44:13.664+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Feeding and AFKing don't solve any problems.\nAll you're doing there is contributing to the toxicity yourself, and how is that helping new players in your games?\n\nIt is better to be an example of what other players should be in game. If more people tried to be an example of good behaviour instead of letting themselves be controlled by other player's behaviour, then there would be less toxicity all round. Perhaps youll leave an impression on some of the new players, and there will be 1 less potentially toxic player In the game.\n\nYes it's not nice when other players ruin the game for you with their behaviour, especially when you're trying your hardest to be positive and nice. But you'll get no good games at all, if you give in to toxic behaviour as soon as someone annoys you.\n\nTry being positive and sticking at it, it's worth it! even for just the moral high-ground.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Project Xayah","date":"2017-08-06T23:39:56.040+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Lord Sessh covered the whole \"Responding negatively only contributes to the issue\" thing pretty well, so I'm just going to leave that as it is (+1 though).\n\nWhat I am going to say is that, if you really take issue with players being able to use smurfs, why not try and do something productive about it? There's plenty of options on the internet to have your voice heard and bring together others of a similar opinion (forums/boards, social media, entire websites dedicated to petitions etc.) Find some information on the issue, start a movement, let Riot know that you, and plenty of other players, want them to do something about how certain players use smurfs. If you want some information, opinions or statistics on the issue, ask. You'll find there are plenty of people willing to discuss it, and help you out, even if they don't necessarily agree with your objective.\n\nDo something useful, instead of just making the community worse than it needs to be (and already is).","replies":[]},{"poster":"Roguestoney","date":"2017-08-06T23:30:47.492+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Lol \"forced\" ðŸ¤”","replies":[{"poster":"CHEESYLEEKS","date":"2017-08-07T02:41:10.737+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"ðŸ¤” it was \"intentional\" ðŸ¤”","replies":[]}]}]}
