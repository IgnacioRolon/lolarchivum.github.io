Toxicity is far more common than we'd like in this game, and now players are starting to feel like they need to sort it out themselves.\n\n>But let me explain why, taking matters into your own hands is never a good idea:\n\n>Being the victim doesn't give you the right to harass others. Even if they are guilty.\n\n>If you choose to do this, I'm sorry to tell you, but you're part of the problem. Riot isn't against people starting toxicity in chat, they are against toxicity period.\n\n>Don't feed the trolls.\n\n>Trolls want you to reply with rage and anger, that's why they do it. The best way to shut down trolls is to ignore them. They're only there to get a reaction out of you, if they get ignored it defeats the whole purpose.\n\n>It doesn't fix anything.\n\n>You don't actually achieve anything by engaging with a troll. If they're bad enough for you to flame at, they won't suddenly change their whole attitude because you told them to \"STFU\".\n\n>I can confidently say that, no troll in the history of the internet has even reformed themselves in a matter of minutes because someone told them to \"Shut the fuck up\".\n\n>Aggressively responding to trolls is not effective at fixing the problem at all. In fact it actually makes the problem worse. I get that you want to help, but this isn't the right way to do it.\n\n>Also let me make one other thing clear:\n\n>Standing up to a troll â‰  Harassing/insulting a troll\n\n>It's perfectly fine to tell someone to \"relax and focus on the game\" or \"your behaviour is disgusting atm dude\".\n\n>What's not not ok, is to to stoop down to their level and start flaming them.\n\n>Lastly, I can tell you now that you were not banned for cursing or saying just \"STFU\". If you're confused about why you were banned, you can post your chat logs here and the community will point out where you might have gone wrong.\n\n>I hope this cleared things up, feel free to reply with any questions :)\n\n\n_______________________________________________________\n\nAnd also what Seras Dragon said on a [similar thread](http://boards.oce.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/player-behaviour/QxXzcg5V-riot-with-excuses-riot-banning-innocent-players))\n\n>retaliation is almost the same as defending yourself\n\n>There is a somewhat grey line there I'll admit, but consider it this way:\n\n>Player: Stop fking feeding you trashlord.\n>You: I'm not feeding/It's just a bad game/No/It's not intentional\n\n>Any variation there of is fine, you are defending yourself. It isn't going to help you any, they aren't going to care and if anything are going to flame you more, but it's perfectly ok.\n\n>Player: Stop fking feeding you trashlord.\n>You: Go drink bleach/fk you you piece of shit/screw you expletive here/go die\n\n>Not ok.\n\n>The difference between defending yourself and retaliation is essentially the moment you cross the line into toxic territory, regardless of the integrity of the target. Being provoked might net you a more lenient punishment, or give you a bit of leeway for fairly mundane responses like \"fk you\" so long as it isn't excessive and depending on the circumstance. That said, the moment you target that kind of negativity at a player it doesn't matter in the slightest who started it.\n\n>It is at that point where you are past being frustrated at someone talking shit about you, and you are proving that you yourself are also a negative player.\n\n>And sometimes it isn't as clear cut for sure. Over the course of a game usually how that behaviour continues or doesn't is evidence enough for or against the player. When it doesn't, that's when reports, context and manual reviews come in.\n\n\n\nThe only advice I can give is to write up a [support ticket](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201898070-My-Account-is-Suspended) and try to un-ban your account that way\n\nHope this helps and answers some questions :)","replies":[{"poster":"bgentle2myashe","date":"2016-07-21T09:04:16.461+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"^.
