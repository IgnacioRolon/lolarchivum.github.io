Trying to get up to gold but how is it even possible with teams like this.. What are you supposed to do. This isn&#039;t even a 1 off thing.

This is one of those games. There will be an equal amount of games that you cant lose, no matter how badly you play. The only player you control is you. If you want to climb, focus on tipping the scales in the 10-20% of games where the teams are somewhat evenly matched and your play will be what decides the outcome of the game.\n\nThe games you should be mad about losing are the close ones, where if YOU had played slightly better you could have won.

I changed my name for a reason.\n\nBut really it's kind of the job experience paradox in most cases. There's a reason you can't advance (a common one is not knowing how to carry properly), so you play games to get experience fixing that problem, but because of that problem you're put into positions where you can't get that experience.\n\nIn your case from those scores, I'm guessing it was the \"every lane dead before the second minion wave\" scenario, which unless you're good enough you can't do anything to fix, but if you WERE that good you wouldn't be there in the first place. And that's our low elo ranked system ladies and gentlemen.","replies":[]},{"poster":"BarryButcher","date":"2015-06-15T13:36:05.155+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Duo.
