Please check the logs for more information. &#039;&#039; Underneath this is a retry button, which i have clicked many times over and it has done nothing to resolve the problem. I assume that this glitch is caused by the recent patch update (6.3) but im not 100% sure. I really hope riot can help me out with this. I \nenjoy playing League of Legends a lot and a fix for this issue would be much appreciated. Any help to fix this glitch from the community is also very appreciated. If anyone else has the same problem please let me know. \n\nThanks, BI0 HAZ4D","replies":[{"poster":"skallepäron","date":"2016-09-29T19:26:07.406+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"Hello i solved the issue by\n1. uninstalling league of legends \n2. deleting the folder Riot Game in c:\n3.
