I had been  punished for toxic behavior and i agreed with riot as to why i got the restriction. After those 9 games i was able to type in chat as usual, but after each game in the after lobby it says in orange, You are ineligible to earn loot due to previous behavioral restrictions. I was just wondering if this was a permanent thing or if this restriction will fade away in a certain amount of time. This may be a silly question, but it was the first time i had been punished so im not sure what happens.\nThanks","replies":[{"poster":"Tele","date":"2016-07-11T08:36:38.236+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey, I'll just clarify what **justkillmealready** said. \n\nThe loot ineligibility is not permanent at all. It should be gone pretty soon as long as you keep up the good behaviour and don't get anymore chat restrictions :)\n\nCheck [this](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/209939463-Hextech-Crafting-Restrictions) out for more info.","replies":[{"poster":"BI0 HAZ4D","date":"2016-07-11T08:40:57.783+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thank you for your time","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"bgentle2myashe","date":"2016-07-11T08:21:40.225+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Pretty sure that it will expire if not good behavior. One way or another it's not perm unless the offence was deemed to require a special punishment.\n\nP.S.
