One of the reasons that skin is considered so valuable is because it is rare. This is coming from someone who doesn't own that skin as well.","replies":[{"poster":"Azirious Mistake","date":"2014-11-29T06:10:59.066+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"That is the most lethal dose of top kekkery i have seen in my life, it was available in store just like most other skins so judging by your logic Championship Shyvana and Thresh are rare too?","replies":[{"poster":"SkarSkarSkarner","date":"2014-11-29T09:39:11.996+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Don't be an idiot. Championship Thresh has been out twice, nowhere near as rare.

Twice, if you count people at Worlds getting her.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"jozza123","date":"2014-11-29T02:33:52.253+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"i agree. i have the {{champion:412}}  and {{champion:102}}  skin. i want the {{champion:92}}  one because it looks cool","replies":[]},{"poster":"Nature","date":"2014-11-30T09:20:03.974+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Championship Riven will only be available in 2016 and so on but then the game might've half died by then.","replies":[]},{"poster":"hðnkƒørÇªmíllè","date":"2014-11-29T07:06:50.480+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"They aren't as rare as Championship Riven, they were both available this year.","replies":[]}]}
