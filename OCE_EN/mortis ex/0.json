If you are in a promotion series then you unfortunately can’t dodge but at least you can mute everyone and focus on your game alone\"\n\n\" If Riot expected you to dodge every time you got a bad matchup then they wouldn't have bothered to make a banning phase.\"\n\nWell there is dodging and while there is a penalty **to prevent abuse** afaik Riot does not say anything about you should not dodge because of X. If you are going into a game and really dont want to be in it then you are far better to just dodge and get out. Sportsmanship is a terrible reason why you should not dodge.\n\n\"(you don't see Faker dodging any do you? No, because he is good enough to play into whatever lane he gets\"\nAgain, you are comparing to the pinnacle which I think is idiotic. He is a professional, one of the top 10 players out of millions, who might, in competition, end up with a bad matchup for team comp or pick order reasons and is expected to be able to play at the **absolute highest level of play**. Do you think a low elo player would learn more by being roflstomped by Faker or by watching Fakers VODs and analyzing his decisions and build without any pressure? I have no delusions of grandeur. I do not think I am Faker, able to take on any matchup and win because my skill, game knowledge, reactions and equipment are all top notch, like 0.00000001% kind of elite. \n\n\"And yes I'm comparing low elo to professional athletes, because if you were to show someone the 'true' game of rugby, what would you show them?\"\nWould you expect them to play like that if they were an amateur and tell them to expect everyone else on their amateur team plays at the same level? Would you tell them to utilise tactics that the very highest level players are capable of or would you tell them to get good at the basics? The top rugby kickers can nail a kick from halfway pretty regularly. Would you tell them if they cant do that it isnt really rugby?\nThere is a reason why there is a problem with balancing competitive play vs normal play. The very highest skill players are capable of maximising every single part of their kit and minimising their mistakes. There is a reason why competitive picks and bans do not always align with normal play bans. Remember Kalista in comp play? So OP they nerfed her to the point she is trash for normal play. Same for Azir. \n\n\"The banning phase exists so that you can ban some of the champs you don't want to play against. If Riot expected you to dodge every time you got a bad matchup then they wouldn't have bothered to make a banning phase.\"\n\nCurrently only 3 people per team get to choose bans. If you are one of the other 2 people on your team that do not get to choose bans then effectively the ban phase is out of your control and you do not get to ban any of the champions you dont want to play against, and I noticed you used champs, as in plural. Well kiddo, you only get one ban **if ** you are one of those 3 people so your argument falls flat there. \n\nRiot even had/have a program IRL called Queue Dodge for employees to bail. Indicating to me that they see real reasons for dodging both in game and IRL. To repeat my earlier analogy, a good poker player knows when to fold. Sportsmanship relates to behavior towards team mates and opposition. Playing a bad hand purely because thats what you were dealt so you have to play it to the bitter end is a bad way to play poker, LOL and life in general. In a relationship with an abusive partner? Oh well that is just the hand you were dealt so you better just suck it up and play it out to the bitter end. In a job you hate? Oh well, you started it so you had better stick with it. \n\nI notice you fail to address the account issue. Rather unsporting imo.

To play the game to the maximum extent allowed by the rules is the smart way to play and your argument is predicated on the fact that you should not try to win if its somehow not fair, to which my response is, if you get a lead on someone and continue to beat them because they cannot 1v1 you that could be seen as  unsporting. Would you give up your lead and allow them to get a few kills and farm freely for a while to catch up?

Quite often casual competitions see forfeits when the matchup is known to be uneven. \n\nMy point was about how your perception of sportsmanship is subjective to your reality and does not necessarily coincide with others which makes arguing it is not sporting to be irrelevant. \n\n*mic drop*","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"He Meant Mine","date":"2017-01-08T05:52:05.431+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Lord Sesshomaru,realm=OCE,application-id=FjGAIbRv,discussion-id=Gb5mImfm,comment-id=0003,timestamp=2017-01-08T02:35:24.510+0000)\n>\n> Morgana is about as hard a counter to Leona as you can get, so Morg would be a good pick. \n> Sivir also counters Leona, and I believe she isn&#x27;t too shabby against Caitlin either.\n> \n> So you could be looking at a Sivir/Morgana lane.\n> \n> Or maybe a Varus/Morgana lane, as Varus can match Cait&#x27;s poke, and his ult combined with Morgana&#x27;s Q/R would spell certain death for any opponent unlucky enough to be caught in it.\n> \n> Im not a bot laner either, Kalista/Quinn are the only two ADC&#x27;s I can play, and both of them are pretty horrible against Cait/Leo, so don&#x27;t trust my advice too much xD\n> \n> But to answer your dodge question:\n> Never dodge.

Caitlyn as one of the highest auto attack ranges in the game at 650. With this in mind unless you are playing someone like Annie (who has a high auto attack range), you usually don't want to take auto attack trades with her.\n\nUse your abilities to your advantage to poke her down if you are able too along with going for quick trades making sure that you aren't in a position to get hit by her E > Q combo which can do a lot of damage. So for the most part I would suggest fighting within your minion wave.\n\nBe careful with the trades that you take and if you can try not to take auto attacks for free. Sometimes its ok to give up a minion or two if it means not taking 100 health in damage from auto attacks. When you think about it means you will be in the lane longer to get other cs that you would have missed, having being forced to go back. (This is mainly a TIP for ADCs but can still apply to supports for when your ADC is taking cs and you can communicative this too them with something such as a ping.)\n\n---\n\nThe next thing that I would like to note is is Caitlyn's passive. Every 6 auto attacks Caitlyn will get extra damage on her next auto attack, it is your job to look out for the visual queue for this (her gun glowing) and try not to get hit by it. Along with this when Caitlyn is in a brush, every auto attack that she hits counts as two auto attacks towards getting those 6 stacks, so if you can try to avoid fighting in bushes.\n\n---\n\nNow Caitlyn's traps can be very painful to deal with, the alter the terrain of the bot lane in a sense limiting the locations that you can walk to. The best option that you have when dealing with Caitlyn traps is trying to ignore them, or force them to place them in areas that isn't beneficial to them in the lane by being positioned in those areas. As a support sometimes it can be ok to tank the damage from Caitlyn's passive that you are going to take when clearing out the traps, but be careful when you do this as you will be snared and people will be able to punish you for it.\n\n---\n\n# Leona\n\nOnto Leona, the first thing that you need to be careful of is her level two power spike. This can be extremely deadly and is something that you really need to look out for. Usually Leona's will start with their Q or E and then pick up the other the second they hit level 2, letting them dash onto you and stun you, setting up their ADC to do free damage to you. \n\n* For a point of reference it takes the first wave of minions, plus the 3 melee minions in XP for a duo lane to hit level 2. This is something that you should be watching for and aware of.\n\n---\n\nThe next thing is warding the in lane bush. Leona players love sitting in the bush until their E is up waiting for a time to strike, if you ward the bush this makes the Leona have a lot harder of a time doing this. I would recommend getting this ward down while they are still level 1 and it is hard for them to punish you for doing so. \n\n---\n\nAfter that we have the main thing to take advantage of at level one which is that Leona isn't a ranged champion. This is something that you want to punish hard, try to get auto attacks on her when she can't stop you by kiting her and punishing her for trying to stack her targons. However do be careful if she is trying to bait you into a level 2 power spike fight, always try to keep track of how close they are to leveling up.\n\n---\n\nAfter that we have positioning in the lane, usually you don't want to stick close your ADC and Mirror Leona's movements around the lane. If you are a squishy support such as Sona this is even more important. If she moves down towards the bush, you might want to consider moving up a bit towards the river, putting as much range between you and the Leona that wants to engage on you as possible. The other reason that you don't want to stick close to your ADC is in the case of Leona ulting, you don't want to both be stunned.\n\n---\n\n# Leona and Caitlyn as a duo lane.\n\nAs for Caitlyn and Leona as a duo lane, the first thing to look out for from them is their CC combos. Often what will happen in this lane is that a Leona will E onto you and stun you, and then Caitlyn will place a trap under you while you are stunned giving you no chance to react. Getting CC chained is something that you want to try and avoid at all costs.\n\nTry to poke when you can taking away their HP slowly as you can. Take slightly longer trades if they do engage on you as once Leona's combo is gone, she won't have it up for a decent amount of time. So get in what poke that you can, and then disengage before her combo is back up again.\n\n---\n\nThe other thing to look out for which is a fancy trick that this lane can do is that when Caitlyn wants to ult a low target, she can start channeling her ult while Leona goes on the other target that will try to block it, CC locking them before they have a chance to get in front of the bullet. So this is something to be aware of that they can do and be careful of.\n\n---\n\n# Final notes\n\nA lot of this lane is learning what Leona and Caitlyn's strengths and weaknesses are and then learning to take advantage of them. Try to disengage when they engage on you and peel for your ADC as much as you can. Always keep in mind though, that if their Leona engages on you as a support, your ADC is untouched and can do free damage, just something to keep in mind.\n\nI hope that this helps, if there is any questions I can answer or anything I can clarify on let me know! Good luck in your games!\n\n~Elam","replies":[]},{"poster":"JesusForgotHisGA","date":"2017-01-08T04:18:59.626+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Morgana for sure.
