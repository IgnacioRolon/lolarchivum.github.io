HA HA HA.&quot;\r\nSure it is a lot of work to add new voice lines for all of the champs but I think having taunts and laughs but no real &quot;nice&quot; emotes adds a toxic kind of slant to the communication. And it would give lots of opportunities for new character interactions. {{champion:18}} &quot;Theres no way they can stop us {{champion:17}} &quot; and {{champion:68}} &quot;I wont let them hurt you {{champion:18}} &quot;\r\n\r\nComment champ lines you think would be awesome and possible character interactions that fit with the existing lore.","replies":[]}
