Why don’t you have better solutions in place for this?**\n\n(Note: This question generated a lot of interesting internal dialogue. So we wanted to include two Rioters in an edited conversation for this question, to highlight that we don’t always have all the answers.)\nIt’s complicated.\n\n**WookieeCookie:** We don’t endorse smurfing, but tackling it is a very difficult issue because of our player population size and the ease of account creation. We agree that smurfing can really ruin the game, such as when a smurf stomps lower-tier players. However; from past attempts we've learned that it's a real uphill battle to create powerful restrictions on alt-accounts without inadvertently affecting the majority of our players who don't smurf at all.\nInstead of cumbersome systems to blanket restrict smurfing we're looking for targeted answers that attack specific pain points. For example, if we find a player is using a smurf to actively hurt the game and other players we’ll take direct action on that account, and in some cases their main account as well.\n\n**Ghostcrawler:** Sometimes players are smurfing because they are trying to accomplish something that League isn’t offering - in other words, the need is unmet. For example, playing with a friend with a different skill set is a noble pursuit that League doesn’t support very well. Other players might make a smurf account because they want a sense of rapid progression that they experienced when leveling from 1-30 or maybe even climbing through Bronze and Silver.\nSo we should be careful not to paint all smurfs with broad strokes and assume that they are trying to grief actual new players. They may have other intentions. That said, taken on the whole, I’m not a fan of smurfing and worry the potential harm to other players outweighs the benefits to those players with unmet needs.\n\n**WookieeCookie:** Agreed! That’s why we can’t endorse it. Instead of trying to restrict or prevent smurfs, various teams across Riot try to minimize issues caused by smurfing. For example, one of the teams that works on meta-game systems developed pretty good detection methods that quickly separate new players from experienced smurf accounts in the early levels. Within a few matches, smurf accounts only end up playing against other smurf accounts.\n\nYou can read more Q&A's about general topics here\nhttp://oce.leagueoflegends.com/en/news/community/q/its-your-turn-ask-riot\nhttp://oce.leagueoflegends.com/en/news/community/q/chromas-yorick-and-champ-mastery-ask-riot\n\nYou will also find a link in there to ask your own questions too.","replies":[{"poster":"Klavinmour","date":"2016-06-03T03:30:42.404+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It should also be noted that Streamers/Youtubers make content from smurfing as they attempt to climb the ranking system as fast as they can.\n\nOr that they use smurfs to have lower queue timers in order to actually be able to play games for their audience.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"DipperOCE","date":"2016-06-03T07:27:39.030+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Ahh your name and match history rings true.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Slowdownn","date":"2016-06-03T06:29:19.099+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Smurfing is RP to Riot!

You're generalising a collective/group based on the actions of the \"few\". While I would tend to agree that *more often than not* smurf accounts are used to break the rules, that doesn't hold true for *all* smurfs. Personally, I have 5 accounts (being one \"main\" and 4 \"smurfs\") yet I actively avoid breaking the rules on all those accounts. In fact, I'm using one of my smurf accounts to make this post.\n\n> Really i don&#x27;t see why Riot just doesn&#x27;t man the hell up and put a stop to it, people wont try it if they are threatened with a ban\n\nThe reason Riot doesn't just \"ban all smurfs\" is because there's nothing wrong with the act of smurfing. The issues arise with how players use those extra accounts. It is, in fact, a case of \"many bad apples ruin the bunch\". I pointed this out in my original response.\n\nI would, however, agree that individuals that use multiple accounts should face more severe punishments, as they simply have the option to \"avoid\" punishments by using a different account, and those punishments should be even more severe if the behaviour exists across more than one of the accounts they use.","replies":[{"poster":"DragonOfTheVoid","date":"2016-06-03T03:40:22.584+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The reason Riot doesn't just \"ban all smurfs\" is because there's nothing wrong with the act of smurfing.\n\nYes and no iv seen countless streams when master+ players make a account lv it to 30 and help bronze players get to plat thats boosting in a way but tencent dose not deal with it.","replies":[{"poster":"Project Xayah","date":"2016-06-03T03:42:44.747+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"That not an issue with smurfing in itself, though.

This would hold even more true if you had queued with them.\n\nThat said, there's nothing wrong with the act of smurfing itself, it's what people do with those extra accounts that makes the difference. Someone who uses multiple accounts to break the rules (such as intentionally making the experience worse for new players) are the \"bad apples\" that ruin the bunch. As pointed out in Riots news post, however, it's not as simple as \"all smurfs break the rules\" as a person might make additional account(s) because of a \"need\" the game doesn't meet.","replies":[]},{"poster":"AshenOCE","date":"2016-06-03T01:55:34.312+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"G'day,\n\nI presume things like this are hard to control.
