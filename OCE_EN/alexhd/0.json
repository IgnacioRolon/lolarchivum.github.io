Ranked is so bad, and undeveloped.\r\nI was stuck in goddamn bronze in S8 (When i joined the game)\r\nAnd I am playing ONLY RANKED GAMES ONLY.\r\nI can't get higher ranks my best was B1 from my first Placements when i was goddamn in a 0/10 ( 0 wins 10 Loss) in the Provisional.\r\nThen i Got down to B3 and back to B2 and then its started rolling from B3 to B2.\r\nI had tons of games and I'm NOT BAD, But anyhow this is a Team game and how you Can put a rank for a TEAM GAME.\r\nCan you somehow FIX THIS.\r\nBecause S9 Provisional i lost 6 and won 4... And i got Iron 1....\r\nNow I got to Iron 3 Because of my ..... Teammates that DO NOT KNOW HOW TO PLAY.\r\nAnd as you know NO CHAMPION cant WIN with 4 MONKEYS in his team.\r\nI don't say I'm Perfect or anything near that but I'm not Iron Neither bronze...\r\nI hope you will Find something that can fix that...\r\nI know I'm not the only one with that problem so if you could please fix that, I would be so happy.\r\nI goddamn cried after a loss streak Because my Grateful teammates Played it so good that We lost.\r\nThanks,\r\nI hope you understand.","replies":[{"poster":"Got Tabs","date":"2020-01-29T09:22:46.204+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Cause riot is brain dead","replies":[]},{"poster":"Nightjar","date":"2019-01-28T01:04:52.971+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"over a large enough amount of games, ranked puts you were you belong. \n\nSome games you'll have a team with perfect synergy, some games you'll have 4 monkeys one of which will be lobotomized, some games will be decided by which team has a smurf, some games you'll fuck up earlygame and try your best to still be useful, some games you will legit solo carry and some games will be a coin toss on which team throws harder in the lategame.\n\nRanked is a plethora of experiences, and through all these many experiences, the game gauges how consistently and effectively you can push your team to victory, through means of a raw %winrate.\n\nYou might think that it's unfair you're in bronze or iron, but a player who is managed to reach and earn Gold would be able to enter that hellhole of tilt, and within a hundred games be moving through high silver. They might not even be playing a carry champion, they could just be a rammus who is so fed he refuses to take damage and barrels through the enemy team, or a Leona who knows how to position and crushes botlane so bad the enemy team always ffs, or a Janna who harasses and shields so effectively she can solo zone out botlane and make it impervious to ganks and make it seem like that Iron adc is a higher elo smurf. \n\nNow true, a Gold player, even in Iron, might not be able to win 100%, but they'd be able to push the team to victory and win consistently enough to make a fairly rapid climb.","replies":[{"poster":"Bazikiller","date":"2019-02-12T06:45:19.976+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"i feel ike it doesnt work for the leo example cuz if ur adc doesnt know how to follow up cuz he is new or something u will still lose","replies":[{"poster":"Nightjar","date":"2019-02-12T08:04:05.014+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"if you're really good, i don't think that's true, also you are equally likely to obtain a braindead support as your opponent, sometimes both teams at the same time, which means the support leo who can salvage the matchup, be it, through thornmail+sunfire+iceborn builds or synergising with the jungler or roaming, or even just playing safe and spam pinging the adc to play safe will win slightly more games on average.\n\nAlso alot of the time, players approaching the middling elos like silver and gold, can stagnate because they don't realise how much small detail and potential they are missing. A Silver Adc and a Diamond Support will usually beat 2 Gold players during laning phase in botlane. As the game goes on, the Silver adc will start to make mistakes, get caught out and fall off, but the point still stands that the better player stood out and is more likely to win in an evenish game, regardless of whether they're playing a tank, a mage, or even a shield/heal support.","replies":[{"poster":"Nightjar","date":"2019-02-12T08:05:44.355+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"you will still lose games, sometimes go on unbelievable losing streaks sometimes, even smurfs can lose games in a row, but over the large course of games, it all evens out.","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"KDAs","date":"2019-01-31T23:52:52.056+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Just keep Spamming Yi and Kayn and you'll be right","replies":[]}]}
