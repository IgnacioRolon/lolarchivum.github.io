To add to that after the second game in the post game screen, one of them said &quot;I report you every game, honey, I always tell people in team chat to report you.&quot; On top of that I had chat restrictions that game so I couldn&#039;t have said anything to even warrant a report. \r\nSummoner names are piicloo and SweetGravy, I hope they eventually fix the discipline system and you two turkeys get roasted for being trolls.\r\n\r\nAll in all my account is going to be banned again for absolutely no reason, if people can&#039;t take what they give out then why do they try to shit talk me and cry when I do it back? Even when I can&#039;t I&#039;m punished for it. Please ban people like these two from the servers","replies":[{"poster":"Tele","date":"2016-05-23T22:40:00.250+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey summoner,\n\nIf what you say is true, then we should be able to help!
