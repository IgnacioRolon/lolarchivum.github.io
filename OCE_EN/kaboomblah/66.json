Shouldn&#039;t I be getting 20 LP, give or take a couple of points?","replies":[{"poster":"xX CyberChaos Xx","date":"2018-10-22T03:09:56.288+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"You're Diamond V. Your last win had Plat I and Plat II opponents, while your team mostly have Diamond Vs. Since your team had the higher total/average MMR, you were the ones expected to win.\n\nMMR does not dictate your LP gains. It just decides who your opponents will be. And depending on these opponent's ranks and your rank, you will gain/lose LP. You're rarely, if ever, going to get games where everyone is exactly the same MMR as you. The system just checks if they're close enough.\n\nNaturally the longer the queue time, the larger this gap will be, as it will keep expanding it's area of search until it finds a match.\n\nAt your level, there is a much higher chance of finding an opponent ranked lower than you, so a greater chance of being place with/against Plats, and therefore lower LP gains since you're a Diamond playing against Plats, especially if you have a team of Diamonds vs a team of Plats.\n\nHope this helps <3\n{{sticker:sg-ahri-2}}","replies":[{"poster":"kaboomblah","date":"2018-10-22T08:25:59.046+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"It does.
