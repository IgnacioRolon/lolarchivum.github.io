They are still used to being able to spend the 75 gold to get the things that a control ward can do (minus the disabling of things) being able to reveal invisible units. From some players I have talked to this has made them shy away a bit from buying the item.\n\nHowever I do feel that it is very important to but them. While there are cases that make it so you can't, no gold, one placed in a position that is good already etc. You and your team should try and pick up one when you can. Denying vision is a big thing. During the mid game when you are grouped and are going to contest and objectives suggest your team to pick up some control wards and place it around areas near the objective. This will help secure the objective a lot easier and give your team a vision advantage if a fight breaks out.\n\n--- \n\nI hope that this helps, reminding your team how important control wards are can go a long way in getting your team to buy them. Along with areas to place them can help as well. Just be careful how you word it, make it a suggestion imo.\n\nGood luck in your games!\n\n~Elam","replies":[]},{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2017-01-06T02:48:10.558+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"A lot of people seem to think it isn't worth the money when they can just afford x dmg item instead. I find it usually stems from them not knowing where to place them, and consequently haven't them destroyed almost instantly or be completely useless.\n\nI find that if I say, to my ADC for example, specifically where I need one (i.e \"could you grab a control ward to place here [ping] so x happens/doesn't happen\") then they'll usually do it without complaint. I think once most people have a worthy reason to place one (which they may be too inexperienced with warding to recognise themselves) they're pretty happy to buy them.\n\nThere's always going to be assholes ofc, but such is life in games like these.","replies":[]},{"poster":"CHEESYLEEKS","date":"2017-01-06T02:41:02.453+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"its cancer.\n\n\"im not buying wards thats a supports job\" bronze, oce server - 2016","replies":[{"poster":"ROGU3","date":"2017-01-06T11:07:19.797+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"\"But if I buy wards i wont have the DMGZZZZ\"\n-Every bronze Vayne who overextends.","replies":[{"poster":"CHEESYLEEKS","date":"2017-01-06T11:51:19.904+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"\"sight stone whats that?\"\n\nevery lux support to this date","replies":[{"poster":"ROGU3","date":"2017-01-06T13:25:28.909+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"\"F***ing ks\"\nAnnie support to adc","replies":[{"poster":"CHEESYLEEKS","date":"2017-01-06T13:35:10.792+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"\"How do i grab this lantern?\"\n\nevery adc to thresh.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"SEKAI","date":"2017-01-06T07:54:37.376+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Given that Riot has to go so far to give every player an independent ward-designated item slot AND completely free wards that run on CDs, introduced an active ward limit per player, as well as making purchased wards permanent after being placed, just so that they could hopefully encourage more members of the team to ward per game and lessen the expectation of support being essentially the bard-bot, and the and result is still very much the same with only supports and junglers who usually are the ones to EVER ward and they are also the ones to take hit from laners who die to ganks because they aren't bothered to ward their own lane while over-extending.\n\nSo yeah...","replies":[]}]}
