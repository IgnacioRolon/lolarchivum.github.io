These excuses seem to be the go-to when justifying why you can&#039;t climb.\r\n\r\nAnd then you&#039;ll get people telling you these games don&#039;t happen enough to actually prevent you from climbing, they&#039;re just minor setbacks - granted, fuckin&#039; annoying ones. I agree. They don&#039;t happen enough for them to bring your win rate below 50% if you are half-decent.\r\n\r\nThese games come along once in rare while, but they&#039;re such a God-awful experience that they seem to last forever and they scar you for life. That may be why people say they &quot;always happen&quot; or that it is &quot;every single game&quot;. It most definitely is not, but they are horrible enough to remember for awhile.\r\n\r\nThe Gnar... oh, God. Not many champs top lane out-trade Darius early. It&#039;s simply a matter of farming and staying the hell away from him. If Malphite can keep up in farm in early stage, so can Gnar. Not this dude though. Just simply garbo. I recommend adding him to dodge list.\r\n\r\nViktor. Just, yeah... don&#039;t be him and avoid him.\r\n\r\nSames goes for Xin.\r\n\r\nThe Braum died to us in the exact same way twice. No variation whatsoever.  He went all in on Jhin. Came close to turret. I separate Lucian and Braum, Braum goes into turret, locked down, dead. I recommend you add him to dodge list too.","replies":[]}
