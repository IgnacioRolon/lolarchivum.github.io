Upgrade your trinkets for FREE!","subforum":"Gameplay & Strategy","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Guys, with the latest patch they&#039;ve introduced one more trinket along with an awesome, awesome upgrade. Now you can upgrade the trinkets at level 9 for FREE!\n\nNo need to hold onto yellow trinket forever now, yay!\n\nYellow turns into blue, which is great because you no longer have to face-check to confirm your suspicions that the enemy is in that brush or doing an unwarded objective.\n\nRed turns into red, but the scanner remains with you for a significant few seconds, allowing you to clear wards, know if your team is detected, set up an ambush, et cetera.\n\nNo, seriously, upgrade your trinket. And don&#039;t be ashamed when you get called out on it and say something ridiculous like, &quot;I&#039;m helping ward&quot; or &quot;I&#039;m holding onto it so we can get vision when it is crucial&quot;.\n\nThe latter one is the most-used excuse, and it just makes you sound like the biggest moron.\n\nWhat are you going to do with it at that stage of the game? You can literally only do one thing - a thing that your sightstone-carrier can do over and over and over again.\n\nYou cannot confirm enemy whereabouts, you cannot vision control - &quot;OH, BUT I CAN CONTRIBUTE A WARD WHILE MY TEAM IS DOING AN OBJECTIVE, AND WITH THE BENEFIT OF VISION CONTROL IN THE AREA&quot;...\n\nYOU CAN DO THAT WITH A BLUE TRINKET YA *BLEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEP*\n\nWake up and upgrade your trinkets. Bloody idiots.\n\nI&#039;ll no doubt get guys who are like, &quot;I hold onto yellow so I can place it strategically so my duo can TP to it&quot; - or some other ridiculous, outlandish shit. Please, spare us your idiocy.","replies":[{"poster":"Tele","date":"2017-01-07T02:03:25.852+0000","up_votes":7,"down_votes":0,"body":"**Challenger players hate him!!! **\n\n**Find out how this OCE player got rank one with this one weird trick!**","replies":[{"poster":"Essembie","date":"2017-01-08T08:48:46.823+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Tele,realm=OCE,application-id=FjGAIbRv,discussion-id=GUz4o7aR,comment-id=0001,timestamp=2017-01-07T02:03:25.852+0000)\n>\n> **Challenger players hate him!!! **\n> \n> **Find out how this OCE player got rank one with this one weird trick!**\n\nhttps://media.makeameme.org/created/not-bad-aqqlxi.jpg","replies":[]},{"poster":"CHEESYLEEKS","date":"2017-01-08T07:17:07.306+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"this made me laugh so hard","replies":[]},{"poster":"kaboomblah","date":"2017-01-07T02:39:40.035+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Haha, nice.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"CHEESYLEEKS","date":"2017-01-07T02:46:08.830+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"somebodies tilted ><","replies":[{"poster":"kaboomblah","date":"2017-01-07T02:49:23.126+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Bro, I am perpendicular to the ground at this stage.\n\nThis is my release.","replies":[{"poster":"CHEESYLEEKS","date":"2017-01-07T02:54:54.698+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"ill admit im guilty of this, its one of my shockingly bad habbits","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Talon12","date":"2017-01-07T15:58:53.391+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You know people use yellows with their targeted spells right, blue isnt off cd often enough for it and red doesnt allow the spell cast.","replies":[{"poster":"CHEESYLEEKS","date":"2017-01-08T07:18:31.653+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"why don't they just buy dat sighstone.","replies":[{"poster":"Talon12","date":"2017-01-08T08:53:26.270+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Because they dont need to sigh, they just need the sight ;)","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"WoadKethunt","date":"2017-01-07T02:41:52.784+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"i feel like upgrading your trinket is situational, hear me out\n\nif the only thing that can be swept with a red trinket is wards that the enemy team probably isn't placing than you really only need one for sweeping baron and dragon which the support usually gets. i find more wards with the vision plant than i do with the red trinket\n\nnow if the enemy team has a couple of stealth champs teemo and maybe even jhin than yeah a couple of people should grab the sweeper.\nif the jungler gets the trackers knife than they should 100% get blue or red trinkets but if they dont they should keep the yellow\n\nif the top laner is going to 1v9 split push all game they shouldn't get the red trinket because they need to ward for themselves, but if they are going to help the team and group than they can get the red trinket if they want, but theres not point getting the red trinket if the support and jungler both already have it,\n\na lot of adcs like to go bot in the mid game to pick up waves and split, getting the blue trinket isn't  a bad idea, however if your full ap brand support doesn't have a sightstone than its not a bad idea for the adc to keep the yellow trinket so they can drop a few wards hear and there when they have the chance to make up for the lack of stone that gives sight\n\nsupport should get sightstone first or second what ever and when 9 get the sweeper its standard\n\nas far as mid goes blue or yellow it doesn't matter so long as they use the damn thing","replies":[]},{"poster":"Anıma","date":"2017-01-07T01:25:33.476+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"jesus christ","replies":[]}]}
