My suggestion when to play support is Plat 3, anything lower is a struggle including plat 5-4 itself (#elo boosted kids for life bois) \nMy reasoning that you shouldn't be calling yourself god because warding and I don't know how much game knowledge you contain is not enough to be a support god. In my opinion it isn't just the warding. A good support will know what type of champion to play for their team comp, how to peel and items based on needed for their team, warding, basic knowledge of league and poking etc, roaming if needed,when to go in and how to make plays. I can go on but honestly you might be bored with it.  A good support will and can carry and most importantly STICK WITH YOUR ADC unless they're really,really REALLY bad lel","replies":[{"poster":"LAKIGR","date":"2016-08-07T15:52:30.043+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Quick question for u what's your option on getting sight stone as a first item","replies":[{"poster":"kaboomblah","date":"2016-08-08T12:43:02.069+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yeah, I tend to prioritise sightstone over everything else. Vision is just too strong.\n\nBut at this ELO man, it really frustrates  me how people can't use vision.\n\nFor example, if we see their jungler hanging around bot, top can be aggressive, mid can keep himself untouchable by moving to the other side of his lane, bot can bait jungler into coming and then getting a counter gank, et cetera, et cetera. That is just one example of how strong something can be, but only if people know to use it - which people at this ELO cannot do - which is why I'm asking at what ELO it begins to be possible to support and win 50%+.","replies":[{"poster":"LAKIGR","date":"2016-08-08T14:02:13.450+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I know what u mean about how people at this elo don't know how to use vision. I had a game where the enemy fizz went from mid though river which was warded, though the scuttle crab vision that we had, though Tri bush, which was also warded.

The reason why I always buy it first is because I know that some people lack map awareness and it is important for the support to provide wards in areas where it is needed (not saying it's the supports job to ward everything, ik i get that a lot and it annoys me ). For example you can ward both bushes for jungle ganks or roams and early dragon control.  Also it's helpful for  when your adc is extremely aggressive during laning phase. I dont know if it's just me but I dont feel comfortable when both bushes are unwarded when my adc is constantly poking and pushing up, so I suppose it's a habit of mine. In my opinion it's best to get a  sightstone asap and switch into the trinket that clears wards, that way you'll make it easier to set up ganks for your laner/jungler.","replies":[{"poster":"LAKIGR","date":"2016-08-07T22:24:33.802+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Only thing I don't like about going sight stone first is that it's stats r crap. I mean all it gives is 150 hp. Iv see people playing Leona, thresh, sons etc come back to lane with sight stone and they still only have their teir 1 gold income item. Mean while I'll come back to lane with my frost queens or face of the mountain depending on who I'm playing and I just proceed to destroy them as they can't tank anything or do any damage","replies":[{"poster":"CHEESYLEEKS","date":"2016-08-07T23:20:57.334+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It all depends on how camped botlanes getting , i can usually get away with a pink and trinket, but if their jungles keen on camping and the midlanes roaming botlane within the first ten minutes get a sightstone.","replies":[{"poster":"LAKIGR","date":"2016-08-08T00:12:52.939+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"That's what I mean unless I'm getting camped I won't bother with a sight stone until later as trinkets and pinks do fine for the laning phase","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Nightjar","date":"2016-08-07T23:21:56.008+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"As my high platinum friend/coach told me a few days ago, at silver+ if you don't buy a sightstone first back the jungler will come murder you if you play aggressive. I'm unranked atm (might as well be B5) so I won't give my opinion (that a pink from the adc, jg and sup can sometimes suffice if you want that early kill pressure) but when I play jungler even somebody as horrible as me has the intelligence to prey on lanes with insufficient warding.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Requiemsfire","date":"2016-08-09T03:32:18.661+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I always prioritize sightstone regardless of what champion I'm playing because well its benefit is invaluable as the game progresses. Some people purchase it without knowing it's actual purpose simply  because the support has to buy a sightstone is a common thought, some think it's simply to ward botlane in the laning phase. In actual fact the sightstone by itself provides a lot of vision in the mid-late game all by itself relative to the trinket. What's more, is that this frees up your warding totems use allowing you to switch to a sweeper to clear away your enemy's vision. \n\nVision enables you to control the map, catch people out, spot ambushes, know the enemy teams locations which of course all contribute to making decisions that could end the game. For example if you know that 3 members of the enemy team are bottom lane farming, your team could actually go and take baron.\n\nI have seen games won and lost because of vision. \n\nWhen your team is lost  their turrets in the lanes and is playing defensively, ward your own jungle, if you're playing aggressively and winning, ward their jungle. These are the standard rules I put into practice based on the state of the game.

So your generally better of building your gold income item than a sight stone since the stats on sight stone suck. \n2 now going sight stone first on some supports isn't bad, but from what I can see from your match history is that you generally only play thresh who is very team reliant and play stay involves hooking someone then dragging him self to them so if the only item u have is a sight stone and a targons brace then all u have is a bonus 325 hp where if u finished your face of the mountain first u would have 450 bonus hp and 10% cdr and honestly between u and your adc trinket u should be able to get ward bot lane just fine with out a sight stone no not to mention u seem to buy enough pinks. \nOk last thing that I can tell from your match history is that u seem to generally end up 2  to 3 lvs if not more, behind your adc what that tells me that u aren't in lane with them. That means u aren't getting gold or xp. So what I'm guessing is that you r either roaming and not making plays and just wasting time or warding. But from what I can tell from your match history your mid lane rarely seems to have a lot of kills so that either means u aren't roaming mid and u r just warding or u r going mid and failing to make a play. And if your going to top that just means u have left your adc all by themselves which u should never do","replies":[{"poster":"kaboomblah","date":"2016-08-08T12:36:59.935+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Wow, thanks for actually looking at my history and analysing my gameplay for me.\n\nDidn't know I fell behind in levels that much.
