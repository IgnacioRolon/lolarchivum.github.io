Unheard of, right?\r\n\r\nOnce a few minutes since minions spawning has past, it may be hard to track the enemy jungler. If your mid and support work together to vision ward each of the single brushes on either side of mid - just before Dragon and Baron pits - then you&#039;ve actually eliminated a very substantial amount of avenues for the enemy team to surprise your team.\r\n\r\nMid should ward Baron side, and support should ward Dragon side.\r\n\r\nThe mid lane cannot leave unheralded. Jungle cannot gank mid effectively. If the enemy jungler tries to invade your jungle, it will be seen, or discouraged. Friendly top laner knows when they can all-in or trade. Friendly jungler knows whether they can gank without risk of counter gank, or do whatever they deem fit without interference.\r\n\r\nOther vision needed for bot lane safety can mostly be done using both support and ADC&#039;s yellow trinkets until the quest item is complete.\r\n\r\nIt&#039;s 75 gold, but it damn well pays for itself. Mid laners, on your first back, try hard to provision for this buy. Supports, goes without saying - just buy one.","replies":[{"poster":"Iloveyoubabygirl","date":"2018-03-30T14:23:14.583+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"***","replies":[{"poster":"Socon","date":"2018-03-30T15:01:31.460+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Do not talk down on our mighty kaboomblah","replies":[]},{"poster":"kaboomblah","date":"2018-03-30T15:57:49.498+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I couldn't even understand what you were trying to say.\n\nhttp://oce.op.gg/summoner/userName=iloveyoubabygirl","replies":[]}]}]}
