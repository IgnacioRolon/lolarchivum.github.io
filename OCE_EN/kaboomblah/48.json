I gripe almost every game about something. But I will never resort to racism or hate speech. Every game I get called a %%%% or %%%%%. I know some people are innately racist, so when they are hidden on the internet, they will go full blast. This must stop.\r\n\r\nRiot, you have done a great job with punishing leavers and AFK. Why is there so little done about racism? Shouldn&#039;t there be words that immediately bring up red flags? For example, %%%%%%, %%%%, %%%%%, etc? Or will this dent your profits too much - seeing as so many avid users seem to be racists?\r\n\r\nI am beginning to compile some screenshots. Sadly, I am averaging a screenshot per game. Riot, you have given us a great game, but you must be accountable for providing a level of appropriateness. I am not suggesting a nanny state, but when hate speech is met with a X-game chat restriction, you are sending the message you do not care much.\r\n\r\nI am sure, if I compile enough screenshots, an authority could be contacted to show just how widespread hate speech is in your game. And then perhaps a precedent could be established whereby firms are held more accountable for the things their users say on their platforms.\r\n\r\nI hope this doesn&#039;t put me on your radar - but perma-banning me won&#039;t work because I&#039;ll just make another account and continue compiling evidence.","replies":[{"poster":"Lord Sesshomaru","date":"2017-03-26T05:26:36.621+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":3,"body":"Its quite possible you could be confusing **racism** _(un-aldulerated hatred for another person because of their different nationality)_ with **trash talk** _(throwing insults at someone because you're annoyed)_.\n\nSomeone calling you are a \"piece of shit\" doesn't actually mean that the person saying it, thinks you are literally a pile of festering facies on the floor.\nLikewise calling someone a \"dirty asian\" or other type of insult, doesn't actually mean that person has grown up believing that all asian people never wash. \nIt means that they took an aspect of you (which just happened to be your nationality, because its the only thing they know about you) and tried to insult you with it. (they could easily have said Four-eyes instead, if you wore glasses,) its a jab at you, not your race.\n\nReal Hate speech is very very different from your average garden variety insult. \n\nAn insult is a surface deep word or sentence that you construct in the moment, about someone from the way they act or look, in an attempt to hurt their feelings. \"Ill fuck your mum %%%%%\" doesn't actually mean that they will come to your house and have intercourse with your dark-skinned mother.\n\nHate speech, isn't constructed on the spot, it is a built up resentment for a group of people, the difference is; hate speech isn't intended to hurt the feelings of the target, _(why bother hurting the feelings of someone who is a lower class citizen than you anyway.)_ Hate speech is intended to distance yourself from the group of people you hate.\n\n\"Gays are an affront to god!\" is hate speech, it is not intended to hurt any _specific_ individual, its purpose is to show how much better your demographic is, than the 'other' people.\n\nWhere \"You gay piece of shit.\" isn't hate speech. The person doesn't necessarily hate all gay people, they are just using an aspect of your life to insult you.\nThey could easily be saying \"You four-eyed freak.\" _(which clearly isn't hate speech, because no one grows up inherently hating people with glasses)_\n\nSo if you are witnessing people saying _\"WTF is with all these asians on our server? Cant the yellow skinned scum have their own server?\"_ then that IS hate speech. But if people are saying \"Why aren't you carrying us you fucking asian.\" Its not hate speech, because they aren't insulting your race, they're just insulting you, and using your race to do it.\n\n______\n\nAlso...  this is bloody Australia/NZ no one is truly racist in this part of the world.\nMost people here aren't even 100% any one particular race anyway. \n\nEven the 'racism' about Aboriginals/Maori is just stereotyping and jokes. Not true hate speech.\n\nYou'd have to go to middle America, WWII Nazi Germany, or ISIS HQ, to find proper widespread racism where people genuinely believe that Gays or Jews or black people are inferior human beings.\n\n\n_______\n\nAre you actually trying to hold Riot responsible?\nWhy not just start blaming the air for carrying insults from people's mouthes across to you as well... \n\nIt'd be interesting to see all the screen shots you've taken and see what you are thinking is Racism and Hate Speech.\n\n_______\n\nTo be 100% clear, I'm not saying its okay to insult someone as long as its not racist. No one should be insulting anyone, in an ideal world. What I am saying is that insults are generally harmless, someone is having a bad day and is taking it out on the people around them. They'll have completely forgotten all about you by the time the next game starts. Its a lot different to Hate Speech, which is when the person is genuinely offended by sharing the same game as an Asian person.\n\n_______\n\nTrust me, one of the best things you can ever acquire in life, is a thick skin.\nIf you take offence at every little thing, your life will be a complete misery.\n\nLook at the current state of the world: You can be sued if someone slips and bruises themselves your toilet floor. 'Social justice warriors' blow every tiny little thing way out of proportion over twitter or Facebook, and make everyone afraid to say anything. \n\nPeople have no tolerance at all. its kinda pathetic tbh.\n\nWouldn't the world just be a whole lot better, if everyone just said \"sure whatever\" and got on with their lives?\n\nThere will always be dicks in the world, that is a fact and it wont ever change, no matter what laws are passed or what ever is 'correct'.\nYou can either fight your entire life trying to shut each and every one of them down, and watch more pop up again and again. \nOr you can just shrug it off as idiots and carry on.\n\nYou'll find life so much easier, you really will :)","replies":[{"poster":"Sneed","date":"2017-03-26T07:56:11.379+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":5,"body":"stop essayposting nobody wants to read all this shit dude","replies":[{"poster":"Lord Sesshomaru","date":"2017-03-26T09:02:32.055+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"Don't read it then?\n\nIf anyone wants to, they can. \nIf they don't, no harm done.\n\nYou just proved my whole point about people having so little tolerance though.","replies":[{"poster":"Sneed","date":"2017-03-26T10:55:44.065+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":5,"body":"there is a difference between tolerance and laziness","replies":[{"poster":"Lord Sesshomaru","date":"2017-03-26T13:17:33.507+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"So if you're lazy and tolerant.\n\nDont read it, and tolerate it being there.\n\nProblem = Solved.","replies":[{"poster":"Sneed","date":"2017-03-26T20:17:22.315+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":5,"body":"the problem is that i'd love to read what your opnion is except that its league of legends so reading more than 2 paragraphs bores me to death. you should just make your stuff short and sweet, not for me but for others too","replies":[{"poster":"Lord Sesshomaru","date":"2017-03-26T22:10:12.933+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I see where you're coming from.\nAnd ill try to shorten it in future!\n\nBut making it short does make it a hollow statement.\n\n\"My opinion is this!\" \nhelps no one. no one cares about some random's opinion, theres too many people on the internet for everyones opinion to matter.
