Your Battle Mage and Support have died.\n\nThe remaining three are on half HP. If you push now, you can grab the middle Inhibitor. You do so. Inhibitor taken.\n\nThe enemy are either just starting to respawn or they have 1-5 seconds remaining.\n\n_**HERE IS WHERE THE TIP BECOMES RELEVANT**_\n\nAssuming it is somewhat of a close game, if you don&#039;t want to give the enemy a way to get straight back into the game, find a safe spot, and FUCKING RECALL AND USE YOUR GOLD. DON&#039;T TAKE CHICKENS. DON&#039;T CHECK TO SEE IF YOU CAN SNEAK A RED BUFF. DON&#039;T TRY TO STEAL WOLVES. FUCKING RECALL.\n\nWhy?\n\nThey probably see you or suspect you are doing something stupid, and will go to check. Nocturne, Yi, Irelia, Camille, et cetera, will find your idiot of an ADC/Jungler/Top staying behind to sneak a jungle camp or buff, and then go to secure Baron.\n\nIf you do the right thing and recall, the option above is totally taken off the table.\n\nAlso, you&#039;ll actually realise the gold you made due to the ace and subsequent push - which means you&#039;re stronger. Yes, I feel the need to explain to you OCE people the benefits of using your gold to buy items.","replies":[{"poster":"BOL4","date":"2018-06-24T15:26:18.500+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Or you can take their jungle and make them have to push, at which point your entire team is full HP with new items.\n{{champion:122}} {{champion:11}} {{champion:44}} {{champion:145}} {{champion:40}}","replies":[{"poster":"Bookbash","date":"2018-06-26T02:36:48.265+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Basically what he is saying, is don't get caught and die because that may cost you something large like a baron in reply for just winning a teamfight.","replies":[]}]}]}
