We have ADC, Support and Top, so it&#039;ll fall quickly.\n\nWe get to the turret, we are banging on it.\n\nMid disappears, still no eyes on top or jungle. At this point, we must assume they&#039;re coming for us.\n\nWe get the turret.\n\n**Now, this is where my confusion begins.\n**\n\nWHY DO PEOPLE STAY AFTER THE TURRET? I DON&#039;T KNOW! EXTRA WAVE OR SOMETHING? IF YOU'RE NOT GETTING THE SECOND ONE, JUST BACK AWAY, EVALUATE AND EXECUTE A PLAN.\n\nWhy do they stay in these random, high-risk situations?\nTHIS GOES FOR STAYING OR TRYING TO FIGHT IN OTHER PARTS OF THE MAP WHERE THERE IS NOTHING.\n\nYou know, the old, &quot;Dragon has been slain&quot;, but your team goes towards dragon?","replies":[{"poster":"pieceofpecanpie","date":"2017-01-25T05:51:48.299+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"\"Dragon has been slain\"?\n\nPfff, you mean the boring ordinary dragon. \n\nBut the real mystical magical dragon is off hiding somewhere just beyond the fog of war. \n\nYou must make with great haste in search for this majestic creature and in due time your wandering and face-checking may perhaps bless you with the smallest glimpse of his magnificent tail and the hairy sack of magic he carries with him.","replies":[]},{"poster":"JesusForgotHisGA","date":"2017-01-25T06:12:48.140+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Try being a support main where even if you keep the entire bot side warded during lane phase ur adc still can't see the enemy coming.
