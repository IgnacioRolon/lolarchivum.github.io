Why... why would you?!\r\n\r\nYou have four wards in your quest item, and they get replenished. Get the red trinket, and upgrade it at 9, so you can actually maintain some vision control. That is your job, and arguably the most important job, granted there&#039;s not a ridiculous discrepancy between your team and theirs.\r\n\r\nAt level 9, I don&#039;t care if you&#039;re building Infinity Edge on Zyra - you should have: a completed quest item, Control Ward(s), and an upgraded Red Trinket.\r\n\r\nEvery time I post something like this, people somehow find a way to say stuff like: &quot;Oh, I prefer having the extra wards&quot;, &quot;I&#039;m wasting one ward if I upgrade to red while there&#039;s one in the bank&quot;.\r\n\r\nNO! Just no! \r\n\r\nI am not trying to argue with you. I am not trying to ask your opinion. I am advising you that not upgrading to red while holding a completed quest item is an absolute nonsense.\r\n\r\nCan I get some high ELO back-up here? I&#039;m just gonna get shut down for being low ELO.","replies":[{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2018-04-08T03:04:22.813+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Usually it's because I'm rushing to buy and am so worried about what items I forget about my trinket.","replies":[{"poster":"kaboomblah","date":"2018-04-08T05:40:04.558+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Buy that trinket, Seras!\n\nBy the way, are you the one going around censoring all my name-and-shames?","replies":[{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2018-04-08T07:48:14.050+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'm nowhere near as bad as I was.
