It doesn't specify damaging them.\n\nE.g. If I land 1 Q and 1 AA with Karthus, my W _(which does no damage)_ will proc Electrocute when an enemy touches it.\n\nAll you have to do is land the spell, not damage them with it.\nSo even though Panth is blocking the damage, he still got hit with the spell/auto.\n\n________________\n\nTbh I think its kinda weird that they put in a rune that is basically thunderlords, but have it work under very different rules.\nIt works too efficiently on some champs e.g. Ryze or Kog, who can land 3 autos/abilities in 0.5 of a second. And screws over champs like Taliyah who even if she hits all 5 rocks on her Q, wont proc electrocute.  Its hardly a fair playing field. Thunderlords was dumb on ticking spells like Morg's puddle. But at least it gave everyone a fair chance of procing it.","replies":[{"poster":"Nightjar","date":"2018-06-10T05:56:39.405+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I think this video helps explain the way electrocute works through a funny little interaction between the cast checks for leesin ult and electrocute.\nhttps://youtu.be/GBqbmsTJzZo","replies":[{"poster":"kaboomblah","date":"2018-06-11T10:21:39.640+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Um, just saw this.

When in reality its a completely different spell. :P","replies":[]}]}]}]}
