If you&#039;re versing Vayne, why don&#039;t you buy Vision Wards?\r\n\r\nI&#039;m running into it a lot nowadays and it just makes me wonder, what justification is there for not getting it? What thought process allows you to forgo them in favour of anything else? It&#039;s a serious question. I&#039;m not being rhetorical. It is an utter mystery to me. Is it a lack of intelligence? Surely everyone Bronze IV and above must know what her R does for her Q. If there is a good enough reason, please, enlighten me. Rid me of my ignorance. Cheers.","replies":[{"poster":"AweClaw","date":"2016-06-18T04:57:40.348+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"tbh if you are so foresightful why dont you just climb out of bronze/silver and stop being salty about vision wards","replies":[{"poster":"kaboomblah","date":"2016-06-18T08:51:35.099+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Um, can I not be addressed by a Silver 5 who often doesn't buy a single pink ward the entire game?

Of course, having at least one person hold onto a pink ward is a must when playing against any invis champ and if you notice no one else has bought one it doesn't hurt to tell them. I'm sure most people will be more than willing to buy at least one, if they remember to put it down is entirely a different question. If they don't I guess it comes down to you and you can always rely on yourself so that's not too shabby.","replies":[{"poster":"kaboomblah","date":"2016-06-17T23:29:36.255+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Haha, of course I tell them to get it. That's why I'm baffled. I always carry one regardless if there's an invisible champion or not, they're just OP. But I can't be everywhere at once.","replies":[]}]}]}
