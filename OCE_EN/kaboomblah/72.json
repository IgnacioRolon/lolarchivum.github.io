Its a mental thing for them....!

A fed Ap morgana's binding will chunk just about any mid or adc, Atkspeed Bard has very very high burst, Ad thresh can and will oneshot enemy champions, Bruiser Leona can be a big menace in teamfights and I have on one occasion jumped a vayne as she was taking red buff and killed her, atkspeed Lulu can be quite scary dps in midgame, hybrid Janna needs alot of gold to get started but has terrifying scaling, support Naut can become toplane Naut if he gets a bit of an experience lead, AP Sona is a strong mage, to name just a few examples.\n\nAlso you are support, but you are not adc's support. If the adc gameplan fails, you're much better off supporting top/mid/jg. An adc that is 10-12min behind is going to take a long time to get back into the game, so it's better if you help the rest of the map and your team try to hold out.\n\nAlso shutdown gold hurts your team alot now. So it's really a bad idea to give someone who dies alot back their shutdown bounty, and most your hp as a tank = as much damage as you can take without dying / taking the brunt of an important cd like veigar ult or malzahar ult and crossing your fingers.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"ThatsBS","date":"2018-06-25T12:05:37.163+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"My big one is bullies.....
