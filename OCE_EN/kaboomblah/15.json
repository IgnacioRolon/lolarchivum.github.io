Unfortunately , you havent met a good teemo yet. By getting doran blade and domination as secondary rune set, teemo can stay top lane forever . Also, good teemos will buy secondary boots for first item and max w after e . This gives him a tonne of mobility and it is impossible to close a gap with champs without dash. He is not a pick to be used in pro matches but definitely a great pick to be used as a top laner only you play him right. You are right about aftershock (which I often use when i get counterpicked in top lane), but idk immobile champs with low movement speed against decent teemo and jayce match up?

Basically Teemo is a very poor pick into Nautilus.\n\nUnfortunately you are only mentioning about best scenarios for naut. I want to ask you. How can you manage minion waves when you get counterpicked??? There is a lot of small bushes in top lane so teemo is free to evade minions aggros whenever he harass him with e auro + aery. And how are you going to set up an auto in first place when all teemo has to do is use q and naut simply cant proc his passive . It is basically a losing trade for him all the time. Ok you might have a control in setting up ganks lvl6 onwards. But think of farm you waste and honeslty teemo uses shrooms right, it is not easily gankabke lane.","replies":[{"poster":"Nightjar","date":"2018-04-02T06:05:38.151+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"naut uses his e slow and he aims to choose the length of trades, you force teemo to either blind your passive, in which case w shifts the trade to your favour, or he holds blind, in which case you get passive damage, and then use w to mitigate damage as you disengage. Teemo needs his q to mitigate your passive, he also needs it to stop you using w's onhit on him, he also needs it to help him do significant damage that won't get reduced by doran's shield, and in the end, even though teemo 'q' is a counter, it can't do all of these simultaneously, and thus teemo loses big trades. Also for teemo to survive extended duels with nautilus, he greatly relies on q max to block nautilus's autos, but this also means he is unable to effectively harass nautilus and use the range advantage.\n\nAlso onto teemo passive usage, dragging the minions top of the lane with your shield buffer really sets up a big advantage for nautilus. When facing a teemo dragging the minion wave topside gives you a significant advantage in the range vs melee tethering length, and often as a melee laner, you'd do this at the expense of a reasonable chunk of hp, however naut can use his shield cooldown early to drag the minion wave towards the bushes, which makes it an untenable strategy for teemo to deploy from the bushes, since you would be hooking him into minion aggro, and this would make early trades swing decidedly in nautilus's favour. With the changes to minion aggro, single target spells such as teemo q draws minion aggro, so if the lane is drawn upwards, then a well timed nautilus hook can stop teemo from breaking aggro and be devastating as teemo takes twice as much damage from minions alone, since he would be focused by the caster line. This also would have a doubley painful effect in pushing his lane even harder in than the naut e, which would mean that teemo would have lost a trade and be pushed.\n\nIf you let the minion wave drift downwards, or didn't have enough mana to drag it upwards, then the lane does indeed favour teemo. Since teemo can abuse passive and a nautilus hook+auto would actually take caster+melee aggro, and hence teemo would be taking less minion aggro damage. However a good nautilus shouldn't be losing the dragging war, since it's basically laners trading hp to get the bulk of the minions to break on either the upperside or lowerside of the lane, and nautilus's high base resistances and shield ability should allow him to expend more hp than teemo can when dragging the wave.\n\nAlso again, you'll be freezing and denying for alot of the lane since teemo shrooms can be used as a tool to force pushes back, maintaining a good freeze, so when time does come for a gank, dropping a control ward or red trinket in the middle of the jungler's path can make it easy for them to get to teemo, since the path is pretty simple since 'most cc in the game' isn't an exaggeration, without a dash or blink, teemo will be locked down pretty well. Teemo shrooms are vision control tools, they don't ensure safety.\n\nAlso people often neglect to notice this, but lane shrooms can be just as much of a detriment to teemo than they are to his enemies, and nautilus is especially good at dragging minion waves around with his substantial short cd shield on w.\n\nBasically Naut w defines the matchup, and it's not about teemo vs nautilus's sheer stats, it's about how each one of them tries to control minion waves, and who has better minion wave control. Teemo's tools are his passive, the speed he can push, his blind denial, and his ranged harass. Nautilus's tools are his AoE, the speed he can also push, base damages, his cc, his engage, and the massive low cooldown shield he has (having a cheap shield is a huge factor in earlytrades, and combining it with aftershock, means most mid length trades will fail to break it).\n\nIf you've ever been hooked into a bad spot and rooted by a nautilus you'll know that earlygame being pulled out of position and locked down whilst an array of casters attacks you can hurt alot.\n\nAlso teemo isn't usually a bulky lifesteal duelist, so I don't think he does too well against naut's base damages lategame. A lategame naut can near enough burst a mage or adc, and only really has issues against tanks with better scaling or duelists like jax, fiora and garen (imo nautilus's worst lane, you lose early, you lose late, and even with a huge lead, being the villian means you can't fight him at all).","replies":[{"poster":"Nightjar","date":"2018-04-02T06:08:29.431+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"also I see you've said nautilus is slow and immobile.
