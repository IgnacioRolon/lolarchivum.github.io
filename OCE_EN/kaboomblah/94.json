Like, he genuinely had no idea that, if he waits, the minions will take aggro and allow us to execute better. No, it wasn&#039;t 3-4 item Malph. It was 1.5 item jungle Malph.\r\n\r\nAlso had an Ali who chased from our outer bot turret to their Red, trying to get his stun proc off. It did not dawn on him that, when you chase, you will eventually get collapsed upon.\r\n\r\nIt&#039;s a place where Support mains don&#039;t change their trinkets to Sweeper. ADCs will rush Bloodthirsters. Shutdown gold is given away for meaningless kills. Jungles will jump into 5v1, trying to assasinate someone, die - especially when Baron is up.\r\n\r\nThere is zero macro. They don&#039;t get what the hell it even is. DO NOT ROTATE WITH BOT. YOU JUST END UP HAVING THREE AT BOT, CONFUSING THE SHIT OUT OF EACH OTHER.\r\n\r\nTake care of that MMR. Nurture it, value it. Do not visit the twilight zone that is Silver/Gold.","replies":[{"poster":"Oriphix","date":"2018-04-25T22:58:53.432+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"Welcome,\n\nThis is what we call home.\n\nCome in, put your feet up and relax.
