You could even make it Camo + longer leap + no !. But as it is, no. Just no.\n\nI agree that, at the moment, it&#039;s just crap and only effective in Bronze/Silver because you see the ! and you just drop a Vision Ward and Rengar is useless. But what he&#039;s about to become is just an abomination to game-balance.\n\nEDIT: You could even perhaps ignore every suggestion above and make Red Trinket II reveal invisible units? That way you have to use Red Trinket II sparingly. Everything must have a counter. At the moment, Invisibility is sounding a bit OP.","replies":[{"poster":"Maraudaur","date":"2016-11-08T23:46:37.495+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Good news!
