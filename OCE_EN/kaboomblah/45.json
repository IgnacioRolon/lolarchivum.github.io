Also, if you're, say, Thresh with fully charged Flay, it'll just take the minion. So the equation is not set in stone, it's just general.)\n\nMelee Minion: 2 turret shots + one AA from ADC = 1 CS for ADC (but if the enemy melee minion is not at full HP, then HP manipulation will be needed)\n\nAlso, be mindful of doing random crap that does more harm that good. For example, as Karma, don&#039;t randomly Q ranged minion wave that is approaching turret when you&#039;re supporting, say, Vayne.  Maybe an ADC like Caitlyn, yeah - but even then, probably not.\n\nLike, not doing/doing this sort of stuff really gets on the ADC&#039;s nerves - and rightfully so if you ask me - and forces them to chat stuff to you rather than concentrate on the game.\n\nAlso, don&#039;t run around with a sightstone and a yellow trinket. No, holding five wards does NOT mean you have stronger potential vision control. It means you&#039;re running around being seen, unable to clear vision, unable to set up your jungler for a lane gank, unable to prevent your team&#039;s movements from being seen, unable to make sure you&#039;re moving through the enemy jungle undetected, et cetera.\n\nAlso, use Vision Wards. For the love of God, don&#039;t be the Support that buys less Vision Wards than his ADC. Don&#039;t be stingy with them FFS. You can just go back and buy some more. If you notice the enemy warding behind you and your red trinket is down - or you haven&#039;t changed to red after Sightstone bcause you&#039;re actually that bad - use a Vision Ward.","replies":[{"poster":"TwoHeadedFreak","date":"2016-10-25T01:56:41.821+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Well, as a former sup main in bronze (trying to main mid when I play SR now), I can tell you that the majority of ADC's yelled at me when I did this - so please stop blaming supports for everything, they aren't the reason you're in bronze. So yeah, I don't do it anymore because I'm in bronze with bronze adc's - I'm not perfect - hell, not even that good (hence why I'm B3). If I ever sup for you, just a polite mention that you'd like me to do it, and I will, otherwise, don't count on it happening because most bronze adc's (based on personal experience) don't realise what you're doing and proceed to flame you before you get a chance to explain.","replies":[{"poster":"Nightjar","date":"2016-10-26T00:25:41.218+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"or you try to use relic shield and then you have to explain what relic shield does and link them to the wikipage because they complain you're taking their cs or xp and then you have to explain how lane xp works in botlane and they don't believe you.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"ErÃ¸se","date":"2016-10-26T10:38:08.283+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"No matter what you do, there is always that asshole who blames you for their mistakes.
