When your Support tells you that you have absolute vision control over an objective, take his/her word for it and bloody go.\n\nYesterday, for every single one of my games, I could guarantee my team a free Baron because I knew it hadn&#039;t been warded since I had gained vision control a few minute earlier. The opposing team had been elsewhere on the map, and the Baron was completely unprotected.\n\nNo, I&#039;m not brainlessly calling objectives because I think we simply have vision control. I&#039;m calling it due to a number of reasons. Most of all being that we have vision control, have a numbers advantage due to a significant number of opponent showing at bot, their Teleport is down, our team being objective melters - or a combination of factors.\n\nIn summary, LISTEN TO YOUR SUPPORTS. They&#039;re the shot-callers. You&#039;re nothing without them. You may be mechanically sound, but when it comes to macro, your support has the best idea of what is happening.\n\nIt&#039;s so frustrating when you&#039;re talking to yourself as support.\n\nUPDATE: Oh, yeah, and more often than not, the Support is actually the most mechanically sound as well :P","replies":[{"poster":"Nightjar","date":"2018-09-04T14:58:37.817+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"realistically the jungler should be watching the map the most, since farming jungle camps should be automatic anyway, and in the current meta coordinating with the jungler is probably the most surefire way to win, assuming they're competent.\n\nand as always, some supports are good, but it also tends to be the hiding place of autofill and less skilled players, and so it's really polarizing whether you get a real support, or someone who is stuck down there and is mostly dead-weight.","replies":[{"poster":"kaboomblah","date":"2018-09-04T16:12:33.759+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"The Jungler doesn't really control vision though.

Depending on gamelength it's not an overstatement to say jungle impacts vision more, assuming everyone in the game is getting the most out of their trinket and buying control wards.\n\nWhilst the support should be warding, the support quest makes it unlikely the support will be roaming around setting up wards through enemy jungle before about 8min.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"QAPLA","date":"2018-09-03T21:54:48.695+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Less time farming and poking = more time paying attention to the map and game state.\nA good support is watching the whole map, not just the ADC or whatever.","replies":[]},{"poster":"VIIXC","date":"2018-09-02T12:39:22.921+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I cannot agree with this more! \n\nWe control the map and we (most of the time) know when something is about to go down! {{champion:16}}","replies":[]},{"poster":"TheDemonEmperor","date":"2018-09-04T12:51:18.338+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"You dont listen to shit players. Regardless of the roles they are in. This is a simple logic. \n\nPeople need faith and respect, to take orders from someone of the same rank and authority as them. Who is going to listen to a player that have no credential? \n\nSimple logic, your words is just as good as their, why should they listen to you?, what make your claims better than their perception?, How are you going to convince them in a short ammount of time?. What you are doing is akin to closing out a sell, it takes real skills in communication to create an effective dialogue. And there is no guarantee every case will have the same desired effect.\n\nJust play your best game and do what you can. The rest is out of your control.","replies":[]},{"poster":"JesusForgotHisGA","date":"2018-09-04T07:44:13.357+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"No one ever listens to the support lol. They also never check the map so being a ward zombie as another person put it is simply a waste of time. Probably why we see a lot of carry roles being played as support. A lot of people in this game are simply brain dead.","replies":[]}]}
