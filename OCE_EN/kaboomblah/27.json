Only the Pyke player sees it and It doesn't make the champ stronger. It just eliminates most of the guesswork involved. I personally am OK with any champ with an Ult execute to have some kind of indicator.","replies":[]},{"poster":"JesusForgotHisGA","date":"2018-09-15T12:48:54.886+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"He's squishy as fuck and feels super reliant on picks. He feels a lot like blitz minus the tank factor. I'm fine with him having an indicator as he's normally bursted and dead before he even gets his ult away.","replies":[{"poster":"Lord Sesshomaru","date":"2018-09-16T07:15:38.344+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I gotta disagree here.\n\nPyke's ultimate goal as an assassin is to secure kills.\nThats literally his job, so if youre playing pyke, thats the 1 thing the player should have to actively _try_ to do.\n\nI feel like if your **one** job is to kill someone, you should at least have to work for it, and not get a big neon flashing sign that tells you when and where to push your buttons.","replies":[]},{"poster":"kaboomblah","date":"2018-09-16T05:47:04.759+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Dude, no way.

Especially people who already have a powerful execute move.\n\nIf I'm Veigar I have to guess wether my ult will kill someone, and my whole point of existing is to provide damage.\nWhy does someone like Garen, who is a tank, get free spoon-feeding?","replies":[{"poster":"kaboomblah","date":"2018-09-15T06:14:19.896+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You mean Pyke, right?\n\nGaren doesn't get an indicator.","replies":[{"poster":"Lord Sesshomaru","date":"2018-09-15T06:37:07.272+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yea, Garen, if you're the villain the sword above your head lights up when Garen can execute you.\n\nIkr....","replies":[{"poster":"kaboomblah","date":"2018-09-15T09:09:02.845+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Oh, really?!
