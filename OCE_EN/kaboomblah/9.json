How about... leave the lane minions alone and go do your job, lol - asked her what in the world she thought a blue ward would do for her. Sorry, but we don&#039;t need you clearing a creep wave before it&#039;s anywhere close to crashing onto a turret, we can handle it, don&#039;t worry, go and ward and clear wards... oh, wait.

Nobody asks you to CS, nobody asks you to position yourself, nobody asks you to have amazing mechanics. Just ward, and through effective warding, allow us to get picks or choose fortuitous encounters.\n\n90% of your worth is peel and win vision game. As in, you can be level 13 (not ideal, but you will be effective if you're just doing your job - which, again, is bloody simply) while everybody is 16+. It really isn't difficult... especially when you have someone on your team spoonfeeding you instructions.\n\nOh, and blue...

Game was over.\n\nThat last statement there just proves that you 110% deserved to lose that game. See why supports don't like supporting? Because they have to put up with people like you who flame them for little/no reason. I main support, but I swear I'll avoid playing it in Ranked at all costs. If you leave lane for 2 seconds to ward the river, your ADC decides it's the perfect time to initiate, gets killed, and then blames you. Every. Single. Time. It's the support's fault that the ADC is a moron.\n\nWhich leads to the next point; when a support says \"play safe\", it somehow translates to \"play bat shit crazy\". No one EVER listens to the support. You mention we don't have to worry about CSing, and you're right. Usually, a support would focus on the map and see the general flow of enemy movement. Mate, I can't tell you how many bloody times I ping \"Danger!\" Or \"Careful!\" To a teammate in another lane because you can see a gank coming, but you get ignored anyway and said player dies, and says something like \"OMFG your ping tilted me!\" (Yes I've come across this multiple times). Heck, sometimes I see an ally chase an enemy into an obvious trap, ping at them to stop, and of course they don't. Then I have to go in after them so I can try to get them back out alive so I don't get flamed for not doing anything (this usually leads to both/all of us dying).\n\nNo one gives you any recognition for anything you do. Whether if it's saving them or landing a team wide stun, people usually only recognize the players who get kills, not the ones who had to spoonfeed it to them. It's kinda demoralizing because you just feel like you're not appreciated at all.\n\nAlso, have you ever tried to carry a team as a support? It's bloody impossible. If you're mid/top/ADC, at least you can get yourself fed and deal tons of damage, but a support can't do shit when the midlaner refuses to buy a Zhonya to counter Zed or the toplaner wants to try to build a third damage item when they keep dying. These games you pretty much just buy every item with an active and hope to God you can keep everyone alive when they go in.\n\nIf support is so easy, then why don't you play it so you can carry yourself to the \"rank you deserve\" (/sarcasm).\n\nI think I speak on behalf of all support players when I say that I hope to never get matched up with you in any sort of game. (And dcing when your team needs you is a dick move btw)","replies":[{"poster":"kaboomblah","date":"2016-06-10T23:20:06.754+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"I wasn't flaming, I was busy begging Morgana to help me ward and clear. Someone has to tell her.\n\nOh, and I main support, haha. I know how much idiocy you have to put up with.\n\nHere are some common ones;\n\n1) IT'S DRAGON!! Our jungler is dead, the enemy team is fighting fit, our top has no TP and is pushing furiously while the enemy top laner has roamed to dragon - good on him, he's doing the right thing. He's understanding that there's no way we can contest, let's get something out of it at least. Enemy support scans the dragon, vision denied, but we know they're there. My mid laner is yet to ward their right side even when we have clearly seen the enemy team five-manning dragon. Don't ask me why not, I don't know, but they tend to do that. I tell my ADC and mid, careful lads, they could go up or down to either one of you, let's sit tight and see what they do. ADC, without saying a word, but telling me with his actions, says, \"It's Inferno dragon, I must try and steal this.\" *Facepalm. He walks into five, dies. Gives kill gold + dragon. ADC and mid laner are interchangeable here. Tell me this hasn't happened to you.\n\n2) One of your teammates giving shutdown gold away for comparably nothing. Your mid laner seems to be a good laner. He is wrecking his counterpart. He is 3-0-1 at 10 minutes. He is snowballing well and truly. He thinks, \"You know what? I'm going to roam.\" He proceeds to bot lane, where enemy jungler has arrived as our mid laner arrives. A fights happens and enemy Soraka has healed her health away. Enemy mid laner's presence is imminent. He arrives. Enemy team are away of a dive on Raka. Our Lux lands E, all she needs to do is proc that passive, however there is no chance of pulling it off without highly unfavourable trade. LUX FLASHES IN, BOOM! a) Enemy ADC heals, Lux dies, gets nothing. b) Lux gets Raka, shutdown gold for jungler/adc/mid. Team morale goes out the window after witnessing such a travesty.\n\n3) Must chase... will chase to base if I must. This one requires no explanation. Enemy champ is very low and someone on your team proceeds to chase to the other side of the map, long after the rest of you have called it off in favour of a turret and/or other objective for fear of getting collapsed on as you haven't got the vision.\n\nHaving said all of this, I still can't support because then another role will just do ugly plays.","replies":[{"poster":"Firebolt","date":"2016-06-12T00:35:31.048+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=kaboomblah,realm=OCE,application-id=FjGAIbRv,discussion-id=dXZnOXHO,comment-id=000000000000000000000000,timestamp=2016-06-10T23:20:06.754+0000)\n>\n> I wasn&#x27;t flaming, I was busy begging Morgana to help me ward and clear.

Another common one is team starts Dragon/Baron even though they know the entire enemy team is on the outskirts waiting for a chance to initiate. Sometimes my team gets it and immediately turns on the enemy when they come, but usually if the enemy is ahead, they come in and steal Dragon with 3 kills. I find it quite funny as a support how everyone's mistakes seem to be apparent. It's taught me to roam bot when I'm playing mid and to take advantage in top lane when the enemies keep camping bot.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]}
