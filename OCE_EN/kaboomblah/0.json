I muscle-memory picked Kaisa to ban, but quickly realised someone was hovering, so I banned something else. Unfortunately, someone else who also wanted to ban Kaisa mustn&#039;t have seen the hover, and went ahead and banned Kaisa.\n\nThe guy hovering Kaisa proceeds to say stuff like, &quot;Enjoy the loss&quot;. He picks Ashe, goes Flash and Ignite, proceeds to int the first four deaths, and then farms jungle incessantly, not participating in the game.\n\nI - and probably the others - wanted to dodge in lobby because of that piece of shit loser, but also didn&#039;t want to lose LP and wait after dodging. So, eventually, we just played. Fortunately, I&#039;m a bit of a Mid god, and I just tryharded - plus, we had a good Fiora Top.\n\nMuch like the remake feature you have in-game, should you have an in-lobby feature - which allows teams to blow up the lobby with a vote?\n\nEDIT: Um, Riot, perhaps you shouldn't censor ch1nk - seeing as it's a real word?","replies":[{"poster":"LAKIGR","date":"2018-05-26T06:34:13.433+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"There reason this isn’t a thing is because it would be super easy to abuse besides you might as well dodge if u get a troll since u are only going to lose like 3 lp compared to like the 20 lp u would lose if u played the game","replies":[{"poster":"OCEshots","date":"2018-05-28T05:00:24.359+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"easy to abuse? or like make the game a little easier to climb? not sure what you mean by this","replies":[{"poster":"LAKIGR","date":"2018-05-28T07:42:15.114+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=OCEshots,realm=OCE,application-id=T8eq2lFQ,discussion-id=wLRYYBJe,comment-id=00010000,timestamp=2018-05-28T05:00:24.359+0000)\n>\n> easy to abuse? or like make the game a little easier to climb? not sure what you mean by this\n\nEasy to abuse since it’s basically going to be used like this. Hey look the enemy tram comp is so much better than our we better remake in lobby or option B. Hey look they got the op champ of the month better remake. That’s basically how the system would be abused","replies":[]}]}]}]}
