Not any more.\n\nMeta champions - which there are a few, so I guess you could say fight meta with meta, but that is not the point of this post - are so dominant to the point where they are unbeatable in a vacuum. The only chance you stand is if your opponent is a complete muppet and you&#039;re good at your off-meta or slightly-off-meta champion.\n\nAnyone agree?","replies":[{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2017-03-04T15:59:07.709+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"I mostly agree with Roguestoney, the higher you go the more even and lreliable things are in the realm of game knowledge and mechanical skill so the meta will have more impact there, but that has always been the case.\n\nWith a few exceptions of champions that really are just too damn strong in a particular area (lookin' at you Varus) my feeling at the moment isn't that meta is overriding skill atm, but more that it is just more popular. More people are choosing to play meta over what they are better at, or something like that. That's just my feeling.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Roguestoney","date":"2017-03-04T12:37:43.108+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"No. Skill is still generally greater than meta in lower divisions.

Though personally I believe this is nevertheless quite a prominent issue across the board with only top lane being somewhat shielded/excluded from this tbh.","replies":[]},{"poster":"BarryButcher","date":"2017-03-04T12:16:05.472+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I think with ADCs right now yes. If you are not playing MF, Jhin or Varus you are at a disadvantage already. Don't get me wrong, you can still win and do well, but the \"lethality adcs\" have a distinct advantage atm.\n\nI feel like mid/top/supp you can play anything and get away with it.\n\nJunglers have the top 4-5 which are hard to overcome but most people use them anyway. I've seen plenty of \"off meta\" like Rammus and Mundo jg do well.","replies":[]}]}
