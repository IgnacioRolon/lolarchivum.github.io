Looking at the cs average and kda, someone in high bronze is likely.\n\nYour friend clearly has no idea how to play. tell them to rank up their own account and learn the game rather than shortcut it.","replies":[{"poster":"Bookbash","date":"2018-03-25T12:06:35.965+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Agreed.

You only improve in ranked where winning means something.","replies":[{"poster":"Bookbash","date":"2018-03-31T07:05:48.168+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Not true, for newbies, 250 wins in normals will introduce them to carrying trolls and afkers, as well as the basics of how to win the game.","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Phos","date":"2018-03-25T03:19:16.831+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"How is that possible, he must be trolling.

My silver/gold friends brought me in and I flopped. I went off on my own and learned on my own and I am roughly at a silver-gold level now. If your friend wants to do ranked then make a smurf to play with him. If you're worried about your main's elo then smurf with him. You don't lose elo and he gets someone to play with. At that point it's just having fun with him and who cares if he has a rough time. He will figure it out or if he doesn't then show him guides from Probuilds etc.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Soju Puppy","date":"2018-03-24T19:53:14.810+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"ebay account??","replies":[]}]}
