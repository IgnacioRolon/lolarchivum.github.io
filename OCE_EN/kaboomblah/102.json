You all know what I&#039;m talking about.\r\n\r\nNow, my question is:\r\n\r\nWhat about Yasuo attracts the intellectually-challenged?\r\n\r\nIs it the samurai character - which one might consider super cool?\r\n\r\nIs it his kit? His outplay ability? His ability to 1v5?\r\n\r\nBy the way, his ability to outplay and 1v5 hinges on two scenarios.\r\n\r\n1. You&#039;re actually good, and you get ahead - which is purely hypothetical, because we all know Yasuo players are never able to get themselves ahead.\r\n2. The game goes for 40 hours, so you&#039;re able to get full items, despite going 0/25/2.\r\n\r\nStop fucking using Yasuo, you derelict, delusional, heavy bastards.","replies":[]}
