The Dragon just died. It literally got broadcast with a huge death scream and red text.\r\n\r\nPeople who do this sort of shit, are the same people who do the following:\r\n\r\nNot recognise a slow-pushing lane - which will enable you to secure an objective on the other side of the map if you don&#039;t touch it and allow yourself to think two minutes ahead.\r\n\r\nAutopilot to lanes. Bot laners do this the most. Absolute cancer.\r\n\r\nSupport with a completed Quest item and still hold onto your Yellow trinket.\r\n\r\nOne-trick, and have no idea how to otherwise play the game.","replies":[{"poster":"Hellopolite","date":"2018-07-22T00:49:47.396+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"if someones carrying your team and they arent there dont just run it up, go back, farm, even if it means a 30 second walk to some gold pocket, wait for them, group on them, AVOID enemies fed tryndamere with 12k gold when rest of the teams on8\n\ndont be shy about taking gold off the map effeciently as a team, dont be stuck to convensions of a laner to lane cs when its 20++ minutes into the game, ur doing the jungler a favour by taking the camps\n\nleash the entire game, its about resource effeciency\n\nplay forms of rts to have the right mentality to do well at mobas\n\nknow your statistical anomolies, if u cant handle 0-1 build hp and armor (etc)\n\ntier 2 boots are best item in the game early for offensive and defensive, if its rough, rush them, avoid engagements or otherwise gank/roam until u catch back up\n\nbe proactive, its the first thing ur taught (by anyone decent) in rts, proactive is always more favourable then reactive if it can be helped, dictating is more effecient then adjusting, doing it right ofc.","replies":[]}]}
