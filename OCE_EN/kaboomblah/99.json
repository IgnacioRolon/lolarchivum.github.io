Story is a simple one.\r\n\r\nWent into Gold promos with 1 win because I failed my previous attempt.\r\nGame 1: Lost with Garen\r\nGame 2: Lost with Master Yi\r\nGame 3: Won with Leblanc\r\nGame 4: Won with Leblanc\r\n\r\nNo promotion.\r\n\r\nI read up on boards and they said to just wait it out. That was last night. If you could look into it, it would be greatly appreciated.\r\n\r\nCheers!","replies":[{"poster":"Deep Terror Nami","date":"2016-07-02T03:09:10.855+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Did you verify that you had a free Promo Helper win when you started the series? If you had dodged and lost your last series you don't get a Promo Helper win the next time.\n\nDid you dodge a game in your series this time? Dodging in series counts as an automatic loss and also loses your Promo Helper win.\n\nDid you get the 'Series failed' message at the end of your match or did you exit the lobby and just see that you weren't promoted?\n\nWere you still in your series at this time?\n\nIf none of these questions help, I suggest submitting a [Support Ticket](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/requests/new). They may be able to tell you why you weren't in your series still, and if it's a bug they'll probably ask you to submit a report on the forum, but they don't give free wins or otherwise interfere with your rank.","replies":[{"poster":"kaboomblah","date":"2016-07-02T04:23:18.818+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yeah, pretty sure - now doubting myself having spoken to Riot Support.\n\nNo, dodged last game, which would have been irrelevant to series if I had started with the free win.\n\nIt's all good. I spoke to them via a Support Ticket and they were very helpful. Told me I had no Promo Helper win to start with.\n\nNot a big deal, I'll get there one day.","replies":[{"poster":"Deep Terror Nami","date":"2016-07-02T17:28:16.608+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Sorry to hear that.
