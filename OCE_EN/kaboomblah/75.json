Does Riot not know that 2:58 is already a two-level difference between Junglers?\r\n\r\nJust have a think about that, Riot. Three minutes makes so fucking sense. Make it by the time minions have spawned.\r\n\r\nThe person who disconnected has already had like 3 minutes to reconnect while we sit at the loading page. No need to give them another three minutes, and allow them to fuck the game up.\r\n\r\nHow did three minutes come to pass?

For jungler though its tougher but hey thats just one role.","replies":[]}]}
