Even like 10% extra LP.\r\n\r\nBecause Fill players don&#039;t one-trick to get ahead, they contribute to shorter queue times, they&#039;ve mastered the game better than one/two-role-tricks.\r\n\r\nJust to keep things on an even keel.","replies":[{"poster":"Nightjar","date":"2018-10-06T11:59:57.412+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"as a fill player, I think what you're saying is counter intuitive. If a fill player suffers because they don't aim to master a single champion, this means on average they'd be weaker than another player of a similar elo, and in this case, they shouldn't be pushed further with bonus lp against even stronger opponents.\n\nI think the greatest strength of the fill player is their flexibility, and you're a copout if you get intimidated by a 3million mastery Yasou or Zed or Zoe or whatever. Sure I might not have 3mill points on any champion or maybe even combined, but I know how to play my champion and I know how to play your champion. I know what the champion does, their ability costs and cds, playstyle, and I can more or less guess how much you can do and what you're aiming for, but do you know what my champion does? do you know my mana costs, do you know how I aim to try to win the matchup?","replies":[{"poster":"Transcender","date":"2018-10-10T07:47:09.308+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"But if they beat stronger opponents shouldn't they get more mmr, just like how the current system works?","replies":[{"poster":"Nightjar","date":"2018-10-10T10:11:53.484+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"my argument is that there should be no mmr or lp bonuses for queuing as \"fill\", because filling doesn't mean you should be losing more.","replies":[{"poster":"Transcender","date":"2018-10-11T05:15:08.457+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Technically you should be losing more though, because you are trading performance (from one tricking a role or champ) for quicker queue times. Just like how when you main a carry role and you get autofilled into support, you don't get the opportunity to \"shine\" in your preferred role that you planned for. It is identical to playing against higher mmr players, the system expects you to be at a disadvantage so it rewards you with higher mmr gains or lower mmr reduction.\n\nHonestly I would be happy to be autofilled if I got the opportunity to win more mmr as a result of being forced into a different role that I am not as experienced with.\n\nInstead I feel like it is more worth it to troll my team in champ select and threaten to ruin their game if they don't dodge and then end up deciding to dodge myself if it doesn't work. The faster queue time thing doesn't quite end up working out how it was intended. You get into champion select faster but then 5 different people dodge, but they dodge at the end of the champion select just incase someone else wanted to dodge so they didn't have to wait. So in the end it could take an entire game before you end up getting into a game rather than waiting an extra minute or so for a game. In fact players always had the choice of getting into games quicker by choosing \"support\" or more recently added \"fill\".","replies":[{"poster":"Nightjar","date":"2018-10-11T05:18:09.273+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"if you're queueing as fill, and are a true fill player, you shouldn't be trading performance, since being a onetrick doesn't win you lanes, especially into unconventional lane matchups, being a generalist with a wider range of experience can be more beneficial.","replies":[{"poster":"Transcender","date":"2018-10-11T08:05:02.100+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"To be honest I don't care so much about choosing fill, because if you have been choosing fill from the start being a \"fill\" main like you said you aren't going to be much good at any particular champion so you wouldn't have climbed as high as you could of, therefore you would be playing against people around your performance level.","replies":[{"poster":"Nightjar","date":"2018-10-13T08:04:05.425+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"who is to say I could have climbed higher if I onetricked?

I love Shaco, but goddamn do I lose alot on him.","replies":[{"poster":"Transcender","date":"2018-10-14T06:38:31.584+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"How do you lose a matchup vs yasuo as cho gath?","replies":[{"poster":"Nightjar","date":"2018-10-14T13:09:49.285+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It's not so much, Cho'gath gets outright countered in lane, since with the right game knowledge and understanding of the matchup it's certainly winnable, but more a case of, it's not a lane that favours Cho'gath to play aggressively in the earlygame and carry, since alot of what Cho'gath has to do early in this lane is to maintain a freeze and try to survive till he gets lvl6 and eventually boots. \n\nComparatively, Nautilus or Poppy have really strong lane priority against a Yasou, since Nautilus and Poppy can deny the Yasou's mobility, choose to disengage or pick to engage, and have the ability to shove out the minion wave whilst keeping Yasou from harassing, and have sufficient damage to hold kill pressure over the Yasou without the need for jungle assistance. In both earlygame and midgame.\n\nThis lane matchup is honestly very horrible for Yasou, since he needs to put himself at a large amount of risk to fight in lane or get cs, since if the jungler paths in, these champions can lockdown Yasou enough to make him a japanese pinata, and early defensive itemization doesn't help much in 1v1s due to the high base damages of these champions. Also the inherent nature of Nautilus or Poppy kit makes it hard to 'outplay' the situation, since outside of baiting these abilities out, it really doesn't matter how good you are.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"NIghtshadowb","date":"2018-10-10T11:59:47.645+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Don't worry dude, Season 9 gotta have separate ranks/mmrs for each role, so no need to worry about about losing elo from an autofill role","replies":[]}]}
