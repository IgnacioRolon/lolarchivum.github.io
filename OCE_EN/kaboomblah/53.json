The old, &quot;We don&#039;t need effective warding and ward clearing. We need more damage.&quot;\n\nThis. This is all too prevalent. It has to be the most irritating thing to run into. A, it shows a complete and utter lack of understanding of the game. B, upon seeing a support embark on this path, all team morale goes out the window. C, it does not put your team in a position to win whatsoever, contrary to what you think.\n\nYou know who you are. I know most of us aren&#039;t so inept as to do this, but enough of you do this to make it an issue. You prioritise your Frost Queen&#039;s Claim over a Sightsotne - if you buy one at all. You&#039;ll sooner grab a Rabadon&#039;s Deathcap than grab your team a Locket, even when you know the opponents have got substantial magic damage on their team. You are running around with a yellow trinket at level 9+ and responding to desperate requests for wards with, &quot;I&#039;ve got two trinket wards on the map.&quot; We check your OPGG and discover you haven&#039;t bought a ward since the dawn of time. You have no idea how to set up an objective for your team. Someone tells your ADC, &quot;Hey bruvva, big wave bot, go and grab that $$$.&quot; Instead of going about your job, you follow him down and hold his hand while he farms 30 minions because, let&#039;s be honest, you have no idea what&#039;s required of you.\n\nDo you see how burdensome you are? If your counterpart is just as incapable, then fine, it evens out and the game just becomes disgusting, with a bad players beating worse. But quite often, you will have a counterpart who has the foresight to ward around an objective in anticipation. Then you, with your yellow trinket, Rabadon&#039;s Deathcap plus one other ludicrous damage item that provides zero utility - **(I know what it is, but I won&#039;t name it so you can tell yourself this isn&#039;t you. Cough-LUDENS-cough) **- know enough that this objective needs to be contested. Your team make their way over. Their support has already warded the brush that you&#039;re all sitting in. You don&#039;t even have the tools to sweep it.  The damage that you so covet is irrelevant at this point in the game because it&#039;s at a point where what you need is strategy and cunning rather than the pitiful damage you&#039;ve accumulated with your support budget. \n\nRewind, rewind, rewind. Your team is sitting in that warded brush. Someone has upgraded to level 2 red trinket or brings a Vision Ward. Lovely! We no longer sit in a warded brush. However, sure as you&#039;re born, your opponents know you&#039;re still sitting there looking for an opportune moment to pounce. A spot on the map inside the fog of war starts swirling red. WTF? WUSSAT?! ERMAHGAHD, HOW DID WE GET JUMPED ON BY A WUKONG FROM BEHIND? Splat. Dead. Objective gone. Game probably over.\n\nAt this stage of the game, you are just getting pumped. You are flaming your team because you are sure you put your ADC ahead during the laning phase with your next-level damage. You are getting feedback. None of it is kind. Nor does it align with your law of supports MUST contribute to damage. You proceed to mute everybody. You have now become the unresponsive and hostile second APC whose damage is no longer relevant. In other words, unequivocally useless.\n\nThen, in the post-game lobby, you furiously go to the charts. OMG, LOOK AT HOW MUCH DAMAGE I DID. MY TEAM SUCKS! How could we lose? LOL, I did more damage than our jungle!\n\nIt&#039;s okay to be bad mechanically. Hell, I can barely play Garen. But to be the above... your intelligence must be questioned.\n\nBasically, don't be this guy.\n\nhttp://matchhistory.oce.leagueoflegends.com/en/#match-history/OC1/200453814","replies":[{"poster":"Transcender","date":"2016-06-08T19:00:00.355+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"\"unequivocally useless\"\n\nThey are most definitely not useless, they are denying the adc 34.8% of the xp in lane that the adc could be using to get an advantage over the enemy.\n\nThen they end up taking some last hits because \"they need gold too\".\n\nWhen you are zoned from the enemy because their blitzcrank will simply pull you in and their bot lane will spit roast and your support is doing nothing to stop it.

Once the enemy team commits this comp needs to fight their way through your tanks. A liandries (or atleast guise) or nomi will help shred the high HP of the tanks so your OWN tanks can outsustain them in the fight.\n\nIf the answer to either of the above is Yes but we have NO tanks or our tanks are behind build a defensive item (randuins, locket etc)\nObviously you need the extra peel and this should be pretty standard fair. TBH though if this is the case I still prefer ryleis as I trust myself to use it effectively.\n\nLook I know it's frustrating but playing a secondary high AP caster is very useful for a team when done correctly. Coming from someone that has lost lane maybe 3 times max since I started playing elise support. It's the player, not the champion.\n\nAlso looking back at your games.\n\nNot having a dig but why did you build locket into a 4 man ad enemy comp with a fizz that (by the looks of it) was no threat? Sure you won it and probably easily but it's almost the same as what you are talking about above. (Building an item(s) that does not help the team)\n\nEveryone makes mistakes. Just got to hopefully learn from them.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Sherk420","date":"2016-06-08T04:21:48.757+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'll admit, i have done this.\nWe were winning the game, and we just started trolling","replies":[]}]}
