It&#039;s absolutely bizarre.\r\n\r\nI know my top stats don&#039;t show domination, but I will always shit on my counterpart. For example, if I&#039;m Pantheon, I will attract enemy Jungler and keep enemy Top laner to at least half my own CS.\r\n\r\nBut here is where the funny happens. Effectively, a 3v4 - because the enemy Jungler is constantly with me - my entire team just feeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeds.\r\n\r\nNot lose lane a bit. Feeeeeeeeeeed.\r\n\r\nBy the time I&#039;ve exited laning phase, I&#039;m versing 2 other carries that are equally, if not more, fed than me.","replies":[{"poster":"BearGrillz34","date":"2018-07-06T09:45:08.332+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Top lane meta my friend. I had once gotten fed 5-6 times in a row at top but lost due to the other 4 people in the enemy team getting free kills off of all the lanes except top.

It's quite difficult to carry games on your own now.\n\nIt's a meme, it sucks but what can you do...","replies":[]},{"poster":"P0lymancer","date":"2018-07-07T23:13:24.362+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Top lane basically has no impact on the game anymore, if you want to win play like jg or mid, roles that actually can carry 1v9","replies":[]}]}
