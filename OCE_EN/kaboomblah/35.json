I know Riot is a one-trick, but doesn't this feature just make sense to any reasonable person?","replies":[{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2019-04-28T08:38:27.994+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I would say the concern is in the potential for abuse. Duo boosting is already a bit of a grey area and difficult to police, and consider that to create a new account in OW is going to cost you at least $30~, whereas in League it is free. \n\nParticularly on smaller servers, in smaller ranks (D+) and at less active times of the day, it can be remarkably simple to queue into someone, so wouldn't be that difficult for someone to play on an account they don't care about the rank of so much, queue into a friend and just afk if it looks like they're going to lose.\n\nNot to mention if a game is looking like it's going to be a loss anyway, one person could easily just afk and save the rest of their team the loss.\n\nThere are significant distinctions between OW and League (primarily the paywall) that mean the approach to such behaviours has to be someone different. If there is a way to abuse a system, it will be abused.","replies":[{"poster":"kaboomblah","date":"2019-04-30T01:58:38.407+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'm not talking about loss prevention.

I wasn't trying to condemn your point I was just a bit confused :P \n\nYou compared it to Overwatch, and OW really is no penalty (not sure what happens on the winning side admittedly, I never really played ranked in OW).\n\nPersonally, I'd love a system like OW has since realistically winning a 4v5 is so rarely going to be even possible, but I also understand that there will be those who would abuse it and ruin it for everyone.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Bring me my belt","date":"2019-04-28T08:49:28.530+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Riot don't give a hell about there game unless it its skins, or changing the meta. \nThe systems they use are so out of touch, if it doesn't benefit them they don't care, hence why the community is so toxic, if something is too far out the way of them making money they won't touch it.","replies":[]}]}
