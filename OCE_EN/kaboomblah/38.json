He hasn&#039;t played in months. He tried logging in recently, he cannot.\r\n\r\nWe suspect he&#039;s forgotten either his username or password.\r\n\r\nWhen he signed up, he suspects he signed up using a bogus or throw-away email address.\r\n\r\nAssuming he cannot access his email for the typical account retrieval process, is there any other way he can get his account back?","replies":[{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2018-04-08T07:51:03.323+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"His only real chance is an Account Recovery ticket through support. They'll ask a whole bunch of questions about the account and if he can answer enough of them they should be able to work something out. I don't know how the process goes with so much missing login info but it's worth a shot.\n\nThe questions are just a guide, so you can give them other info that's helpful as well as. Basically anything that is unique to the account but not visible on it. Could be things like, I bought x skin on release day, I bought x champion when they dropped to 6300, I transferred regions at roughly this time and so on and so forth.\n\nhttps://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/requests/new","replies":[{"poster":"kaboomblah","date":"2018-04-08T09:02:29.009+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Cheers, mate!","replies":[]}]}]}
