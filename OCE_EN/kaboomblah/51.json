It&#039;s really testament to how bad you are and how little you understand this game.\n\nThe incredibly obvious reasons include:\na) ADC champions bring no utility. Can&#039;t tank, can&#039;t CC effectively, need peel/can&#039;t peel... the list goes on.\nb) Your team already has another ADC - this is almost as bad as the Support who thinks they need to be APC.\nc) Your lane counterpart - if they have chosen an appropriate top laner - is actually designed to negate you later in the game.\nd) If you get lucky and your opponent is a complete knob like yourself, you may well carry the game. Otherwise, they will just ward, give up some CS, wait for ganks and you will be stuffed.\n\nBasically, mid-game scenario looks something like that.\n\nMaokai - Boots, ROA and Chainmail\nYou - Boots, BOTRK or IE or Phantom Dancer (or anything else stupid)\n\nMaokai comes along.

Can't tank, can't CC effectively, need peel/can't peel... the list goes on.\n\nQuinn brings a blind that is more useful during team fights and effectively stops champs from hitting her unless its blind luck\nQuinn's E \"Vault\" is a disrupt that displaces the target enemy, stops channels, briefly slows them by 50% and places her at maximum attack range. This is quite useful for solo and team fights.\n\nAdditionally, Quinn can tank. Just because tank Quinn isn't \"the meta\" doesn't mean it won't work.\n\n\n> b) Your team already has another ADC - this is almost as bad as the Support who thinks they need to be APC.\n\nSo having two \"ADC's\" (I'm sure you actually meant \"marksman\", but something something layman) is bad? Does that mean having more than one tank is bad, or more than one assassin is bad?\n\nAlso, if you did mean ADC, does that mean that the jungler can't be Master Yi, since he is also an ADC?\n\n\n> c) Your lane counterpart - if they have chosen an appropriate top-laner - is actually designed to negate you later in the game.\n\nLike all ranked games, of course your lane counterpart is going to choose something that counters you. Your team does the same when they choose their champions. That's the whole point of seeing what the other team chooses, so you can effectively counter it.\n\n\n>d) If you get lucky and your opponent is a complete knob like yourself, you may well carry the game. Otherwise, they will just ward, give up some CS, wait for ganks and you will be stuffed.\n\nSo if I don't take a \"Marksman\" top and I am losing lane, I shouldn't ward, give up some CS and wait for a gank? \n\nThis can apply to any top-lane scenario, not just a marksman top.\n\n\n>Basically, mid-game scenario looks something like that.\n\n>Maokai - Boots, ROA and Chainmail\n>You - Boots, BOTRK or IE or Phantom Dancer (or anything else stupid)\n\nSo you're saying to not buy items that help chunk the enemy top-laner?  Also, how can you be sure (hint, you can't unless you can see the intricate web that is all future possiblities) that those will be the items the \"marksman\" will have at mid-game? \n\nIf you can see the future, why are you getting into queues with marksman top?

Your argument is still invalid regardless. What you don't know is i have a S1-4 account with over 3k games on it, this is a new account from this year pretty much and yeah.... im a little Rifted out after 5 mastery 7 champs, im looking for a new handful of champs and im not particular inspired atm, so i'm aram'ing to sandbox team fights and see what i play with well and enjoy also. \n\nThanks for trying to troll even though you think i have no experience. I can probably say im closer to 4-4.5k games total since the start of Season 1 over 2 accounts. \n\nThanks however :) \n\nAnd yeah, i qualified as silver, 14 ranked games wooohah! thats how much i enjoy ranked, OCE low level is toxic as hell, so next point you want to make? \n\nIf you can't see how Quinn can help protect the backline in the Rift, don't bother. \n\nYou're theorycrafting is as pathetic as your assumptions about my experience and understanding of the game in total.","replies":[{"poster":"Devils Advocate","date":"2016-07-26T03:35:21.933+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"And all you've shown everyone, is that you assume to have ingame knowledge...\n\nASSUME...\n\nlike you assume my experience and knowledge.\n\nAll you've shown is a bigoted immature elitist attitude.","replies":[{"poster":"kaboomblah","date":"2016-07-26T03:56:17.953+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Dude...
