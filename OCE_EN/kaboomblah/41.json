The enemy is ahead, you&#039;ve got no vision control.\r\n\r\nThey&#039;ve just taken Dragon.\r\n\r\nDon&#039;t fucking go bot-side to start warding. What the fuck is wrong with you? The objective has already been taken. What&#039;s the point of doing that now?\r\n\r\nGo and get vision control around Baron, you nonce. \r\n\r\nIf your Sweeper detects nothing, then actively ping your team to assist you so you can pick off the enemy Support who will be looking to ward Baron now.\r\n\r\nThe amount of times I see, &quot;Enemy team has slain the Dragon&quot;, and then have our Support proceed to walk towards the Dragon pit to ward around it.\r\n\r\nAbsolutely nonsensical, garbage-arse move.","replies":[{"poster":"CNFAAGFKU","date":"2018-09-19T09:48:32.371+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Probs thats,where u belong","replies":[]}]}
