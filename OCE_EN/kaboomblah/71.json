Admittedly though, overall it's generally just a mistake because you miss sightstone and didn't notice, although I'll argue that against bushstrat teams, red trinket is better than red sweeper because of the extra range.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Periscope","date":"2018-03-28T03:23:39.625+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"But it also seems kinda dumb to exchange trinkets if you still have a ward in your trinket slot. Otherwise, you waste the ward, and end up with a 2min CD on a sweeper trinket, regardless.","replies":[]}]}
