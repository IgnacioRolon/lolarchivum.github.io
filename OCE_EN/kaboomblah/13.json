Normally they do have heal for summ + utility from support so a single mistake for them is rather forgiving. Also, most of them are ranged and freezing bottom is not effective as freezing in top lane lane. This all means it is a rather forgiving role and worst thing can happen is losing your tower. Not saying it is not an important role as most snowballing starts in bottom nowdays and you need to have a really good reflex during teamfights.","replies":[{"poster":"Iloveyoubabygirl","date":"2018-04-01T11:57:50.935+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"you need a good computer good body and good internet (1+1+1 system) for most payoff generated which is in the adc role","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"fism","date":"2018-03-29T08:35:39.240+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You say \"low elo\" but isn't gold low elo too?","replies":[{"poster":"Iloveyoubabygirl","date":"2018-04-01T11:56:20.218+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"anything under master elo is a headache, diamond will at least follow team opens (9/10 if they deserve to be there)","replies":[]},{"poster":"Bookbash","date":"2018-04-01T06:43:12.416+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Gold is fishburger elo.
