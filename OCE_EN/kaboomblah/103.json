Both teams are crap and should learn to be a bit humbler. H2K now run into a Korean team and their exit from Worlds is assured. I guarantee there will be no such BM from the Korean team while they just shit on H2K.\r\n\r\nJust a bunch of bads beating worse and thinking they&#039;re good. Shame!","replies":[]}
