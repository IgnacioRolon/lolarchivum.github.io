Yes, I&#039;ll have the odd game where I stomp, but a lot of time, I find myself carried in the late game and my ganks not being as easy as they should be given Lee Sin&#039;s amazing kit. I mean, early game should be terrorised by Lee Sin just kicking the living shit out of his opponents.\r\n\r\nI think it boils down to one simple thing. Simple is best.\r\n\r\nHis R is incredibly powerful. It does a shit tonne of damage, displaces and stuns. It&#039;s farking nuclear.\r\n\r\nIf you&#039;ve played LoL for a month or two, you&#039;re familiar with the Insec kick. For those who don&#039;t know it by name, you&#039;ll know the play. Q-Q, W to ward behind enemy, R into your team.\r\n\r\nHowever, when ganking at 6 or when the game is still in the laning phase, Insec or other high-mechanic plays shouldn&#039;t be necessary. \r\n\r\nFor example, if Lee Sin is ganking mid from the top side through the river and the enemy mid laner is as close to your turret as they are to theirs. Lee Sin&#039;s play should not be QQWR. It should simply be WR - or even walk up and R - and your mid laner should go to where the enemy going to eventually end up. As their displacement will be linear and the distance doesn&#039;t vary, there should be nothing easier than predicting where they will land. The only time Lee Sin&#039;s R cannot be followed up is if Lee somehow botches it so hard that he kicks the opponent towards their own turret or if the opponent flashes.\r\n\r\nI&#039;ve played a lot of Lee SIn and my win rate is abysmal. I&#039;m going to go for this approach from now on. Whichever lane I&#039;m ganking, I&#039;m just going to kick the enemy champion&#039;s face in immediately.\r\n\r\nJust to reiterate. People think QQWR provides the highest chance of a successful gank. It does if executed crisply, but more often than not, it&#039;s completely unnecessary. As long as the opponent isn&#039;t displaced into a very fortuitous position, the time granted while the enemy is airborne and then the resultant position away from any safety they find themselves in should provide the perfect circumstances for your team to contribute. Basically, enemy champions do not need to be delivered to your ally&#039;s feet.","replies":[{"poster":"ImperiusË†","date":"2016-07-13T07:38:28.394+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I am a Lee Sin main and I tend to save my Q, as it is arguably his most crucial spell. I typically tend to gap close using a ward jump or flash if in dire situations and kick them, and while they are being knocked back by the Dragon's Rage they are unable to move, therefore you can land your Sonic Wave with ease, and it looks good at the same time.\n\nAlso, with the recent buff to Lee Sin's Safeguard (W), it is probably better to max it second now (personal preference), as the E upgrade isn't that great and the Spell Vamp/Life steal sustain is quite useful in the jungle.","replies":[]},{"poster":"TheOneUser","date":"2016-07-13T07:25:59.684+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I rarely ever see lee sin streamers initiate with Q though they're ganking high elo players who initiate for you.\nHaven't played lee sin since my kicks killed more teammates than targets from lack of co-ordination","replies":[]},{"poster":"Knuuckles","date":"2016-07-13T06:34:49.766+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It's even better to qqr flash giving the opponent no time to react with a counter flash","replies":[]},{"poster":"JasonWazza","date":"2016-07-13T06:19:39.558+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It's actually better for lane ganks to QRQ as you will follow them through.","replies":[]}]}
