Or that it&#039;s always day time?&quot;\n\nShyvana - already fed up with Caitlyn after she managed to fill Graves&#039; pockets 10 times in as many minutes - mumbles, &quot;Shut up. We&#039;re getting this Red Dragon.&quot;\n\nSomewhere in the background, &quot;The Dragon has been slain.&quot;\n\n&quot;Back to your assignments. The next one will be ours&quot;, growls the reasonable Noxian general.\n\n&quot;Hold on, we can&#039;t be sure.&quot;\n\nCaitlyn&#039;s air-headed thought is met with a chorus of ridicule. Darius - a general who upon strategy is by no means lost - as frustrated as he is, manages to get his words through.\n\n&quot;Markswoman. Do not go there. You have been warned twice.&quot;\n\nCaitlyn looks at Vi and Vi lets her know that the logic is infallible with a shrug.\n\n&quot;No, I have to see for myself.&quot;\n\nCaitlyn trundles over. Even the Gromp lowers his eyes and slowly shakes his head.\n\nGraves and Nautilus chat idly in the brush as blue light encompasses them. Graves&#039; humour is lost on the armour-clad enigma.\n\n&quot;Well, well, well, more damage never hurt nobody, did it?&quot;\n\n&quot;Dummij?&quot;\n\n&quot;Never mind. Wait... is that the cop? What in blazing shyte is she doing?&quot;\n\n&quot;Dummij?&quot;\n\n&quot;Yeah. What the hell does she want? Punish her.&quot;\n\nCaitlyn peers into the Dragon&#039;s lair, convincing herself that the Dragon is indeed gone.\n\nAn anchor the size of a small car sails past her. The chain goes taut, the anchor sits for a moment longer and rushes toward her with frightening speed.\n\nWith reactions that bely her intelligence... FLASH! HEAL! Caitlyn&#039;s quick thinking extends her life.\n\n&quot;Okay, legs, let&#039;s do this.&quot;\n\nShe runs like she has never run before, but her Doran&#039;s Blade is heavy, her five Short Swords, cumbersome. \n\n&quot;Hey! This way! You can do this. Remember what I showed you yesterday! Use the recoil to get onto the ledge.&quot;\n\nVi furiously hails Caitlyn from atop a ledge.\n\nAs she runs, she turns her head. The ground is exploding. She&#039;s seen this before and she knows death is imminent. Her life flashes before her eyes as she thinks,\n\n&quot;Look&#039;it that Graves. He&#039;s got a truckload of items while me, just these damn Short Swords. Life ain&#039;t fair!&quot;\n\nSomewhere, Shyvana screams, Darius reminds himself to kill that bitch once she stops dying, Vi re-evaluates their friendship and Thresh flays a poor minion.\n\n**CHAPTER 2: General tactics**\n\nDarius hefts his mighty axe, its weight is so familiar. The first wave of knee-high minions walks past him.\n\n&quot;Prepare yourself. I&#039;ll send you home without legs, Ionian! You are mine, you are... apprehended!&quot;\n\nDarius masterfully traps the Ionian general between hilt and blade and tugs viciously. Irelia&#039;s grunt of pain is not unfamiliar to Darius, many a victim has taken this short and painful journey. Noxian and Ionian, face to face. Irelia&#039;s expression of shock and her sudden vulnerability excites Darius and another part of him hardens. She turns to run as so many have before. She knows she cannot withstand the onslaught that is to come. She has witnessed the General&#039;s dance of death before. Many brave friends have met their end by his hands. His grip slides up the hilt, his grip now just below the steel double-headed axeblade. In the second that they were face to face the Noxian had noted her beauty, ravishing contours of her body and suppleness of her flawless skin. He feels the slightest regret that he is killing her and not ravaging her. Darius scores her thigh to the bone. The deed is done. The crescendo is arriving. There will be no encore. No victim comes back from this. Darius assumes a more conventional grip and hoists his massive axe to waist height. His powerful wrists turn the hilt so that the keen edge can dine on flesh. He swings mightily and swiftly. Minions&#039; heads are cleaved and those unfortunate enough to take the hilt are bludgeoned and die a slower death.\n\nDarius examines his work, only to find Irelia has managed to escape doom.\n\n&quot;You are reckless, General&quot;, her yell comes from afar, a slaughtered minion is bloodied pulp at her feet.\n\n&quot;Don&#039;t worry. This won&#039;t take long&quot;, she whispers in his ear, having closed the gap seemingly instantly.\n\n&quot;But... h...&quot;\n\nThe Noxian general is dealt an awful blow, his armour gives way like it wasn&#039;t there. Doubled-up and helpless, Irelia&#039;s onslaught is relentless. Her curious and deadly blades make little work of the General and the magic infused within them close her flowing wounds.\n\nIrelia rummages through the corpse&#039;s pockets. Any other corpse, she may feel dishonourable, but not with a Noxian&#039;s.\n\nFamiliar blue light sends her to a Yordle weaponsmith. It's a jovial little thing that nobody would take seriously at first glance. But Irelia knows it has weaponry that could end worlds. She purchases a glowing pink ward so that the cunning Fiddlesticks may not surprise her. She exchanges good coin for a mallet and blue sword. She infuses their magic into her blades. Armed to the teeth, she goes to meet the Noxian again. She welcomes the Rift&#039;s negation of permanent death, for she has more pain to deliver the Noxian. That is all they give. That is all they deserve.\n\nDarius joins the battle on the outskirts, cautious and opportunistic. He knows cunning will win this battle now. She has the Yordle&#039;s formidable trinkets and her pockets are brimming with gold - his gold. \n\n&quot;Where is that damn Scarecrow? I will need him for this.&quot;\n\nIrelia meets him, brazen and merciless. Whenever the Noxian general attempts to cut down one of hers she sends him away with a reminder of their previous encounter.\n\nDarius is becoming impatient and the anger compounds. The Scarecrow dares ignore his commands! Does he not know that his General has a plan for this Ionian bitch? Suddenly, red flame engulfs him. His muscles twitch and bulge, his axe feels lighter and keener. His eyes widen and a smirk creeps onto his lips. That Scarecrow hasn&#039;t got hay for brains after all.\n\nIrelia&#039;s grace in battle has never been surpassed. The way she slaughters is rhythmic, not like the Noxian general.\n\n&quot;They are but brutes and savages. Noxians are worth their weight in ash.&quot;\n\nKarma had said that once. The memory of her friend abandons her quickly as she is rudely jerked out of her thoughts.\n\n&quot;You have not learnt, Noxian!&quot;, she spits. Her contempt drives her to behave out of character. She rarely displays fury.\n\n&quot;Send my regards to the corpse that is Karma, bitch. I send you to meet her.&quot;\n\nDarius has made sure there is no other life force on the battlefield except his and hers. The savage General has not even spared his own minions. He may be a brute, but his cunning knows no bounds. He is a tested warrior who has bested foes of all kind. \n\n&quot;You... savage...&quot;\n\nHer neck cranes upward. The sun is bright and warm. Does it ever set? That is a curious thing. The silhouette of death holds in the air for a moment. His gleaming teeth shine through a wicked smile. Irelia closes her eyes. At least it will be quick.\n\nCRUNCH! \n\nThe force of the collision between Rammus and Darius knocks Darius from the air into a wall no less than 20 feet away. Darius' armour wraps him loosely, crumpled and damaged beyond usefulness. Rammus' armour is unscathed. The creature's armour is stuff of legend. Nothing gets past it, not even the Weaponsmith has a solution.\n\n&quot;OK.&quot;\n\nIrelia nods. She knows it is the inquisitive variation of the creature&#039;s one-word vocabulary. Irelia, grateful, limps away to assuage her terrible wounds.\n\nDarius' plan becomes his folly as the punishing photons of the turret along with Rammus&#039; heavy blows end him once more. None of his minions are there to see him die.","replies":[{"poster":"xWZDx","date":"2016-07-02T10:53:42.062+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"\"Irelia's expression of shock and her sudden vulnerability excites Darius and another part of him hardens.\"\n\n ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)_ I see how it is._","replies":[{"poster":"kaboomblah","date":"2016-07-02T11:00:12.336+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"What can I say?
