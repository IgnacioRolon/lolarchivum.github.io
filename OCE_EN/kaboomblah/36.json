Saying you keep getting teams with <1 KDA is misleading and just not true, look through your history.\n\nFrom what I can tell, your struggle likely stems from the fact that you've plateaued. You've hit your 50% winrate, so without significant improvement (which happens over time) you aren't going to climb any higher.\n\nSometimes you do just get bad teammates, but you also have to consider that oftentimes the loss causes the bad KDA, rather than the other way around. If your team is losing laning phase because the enemy team is just better, of course KDAs are going to be low. Since you're most likely at your correct rank, half the time the enemy team is just going to be better.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Aneirin","date":"2018-09-09T21:24:58.806+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Got any proof?
