We aren&#039;t pushing and no other lane is shoving. You&#039;re just soloing in a lane for no real reason. You&#039;ll probably just get picked off.&quot;\r\n\r\n&quot;Nah, I&#039;m split pushing.&quot;\r\n\r\n#2 WAVE MANIPULATION\r\n\r\n&quot;Okay, Baron up soon. Let&#039;s get those waves shoving. Go and clear one wave so it can slow push.&quot;\r\n\r\n&quot;Nah, I&#039;ll push it further.&quot;\r\n\r\n&quot;No... that&#039;s not effective...&quot;\r\n\r\n&quot;?!?!?!?!?&quot;\r\n\r\n&quot;Baron is up in a minute. Let it slow push.&quot;\r\n\r\n&quot;I don&#039;t understand. Fuckin&#039; noob. I&#039;ll push it to turret and come.&quot;","replies":[{"poster":"WoadKethunt","date":"2016-11-01T02:24:47.929+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"i think whats worse is when the top laner just sits mid for like 10 mins instead of trying set the side lanes up","replies":[]}]}
