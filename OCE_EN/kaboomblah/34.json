I just tested it and it worked fine on mine. Not sure what setting would cause that not to, maybe try a client repair? I've had some weird camera lock bugs in the past and that usually fixed it.","replies":[{"poster":"kaboomblah","date":"2018-10-17T12:43:44.035+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"So hold space, so that my camera is locked onto my Champion. And right-click the minimap, so the Champion moves to that spot, but the camera is still locked on Champion.\n\nIt doesn't work.\n\nOkay, will try the restart. Thanks, Seras - you the best. Let us name/shame, though!","replies":[{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2018-10-17T14:15:24.828+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hmm now that I haven't tried, I don't right click the map very often at all and I can't say I recall doing it while holding space. I though you meant moving the map, not moving your champ with the map. If a repair doesn't help I'd probs ask support, that's a new one on me.\n\nYou can name and shame bots if that floats your boat.","replies":[]}]}]}]}
