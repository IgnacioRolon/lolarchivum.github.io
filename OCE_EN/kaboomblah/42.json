Sure, there are plenty that are bad/mediocre, but all elite ballers have always been African Americans. My statement is: while there are plenty of decent Chinese players, the most toxic players I meet tend to be Chinese, and I just go, \"Oh, this ol' chestnut.\"\r\n\r\nIt must be the one-child policy that's led to little emperor/empress syndrome?\r\n\r\nThe moment they face any adversary in-game or they feed, they become so fucking toxic. Had an Ahri feed 4 straight, and apparently it was Caitlyn's fault? She died in laning phase four times solo.\r\n\r\nThen proceeds just be a complete prat the rest of the game.\r\n\r\nWas not at all surprised to see him typing in Chinese in post-game lobby.","replies":[{"poster":"Sgt Scuba Steve","date":"2018-06-28T21:42:31.002+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'm also sick to death of the constant SB, every single game there is always that one person that likes to spam it.","replies":[]},{"poster":"NIghtshadowb","date":"2018-05-11T08:15:02.488+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":2,"body":"Pls no racism :C","replies":[{"poster":"kaboomblah","date":"2018-05-12T04:06:49.075+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"Yeah, yeah, I wrote this knowing that I'd sound racist AF.
