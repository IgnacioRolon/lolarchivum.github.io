After that i sorta went nah happy where i am, i didnt play many games this year because i dont play ranked much ( i will like to next season because i like casual games) But people who play over 400+ who are Gold deserve it.. Anyway off topic \n\nPoint is Gold seperates the good players to the better players and so on so forth.
