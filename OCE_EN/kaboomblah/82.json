I keep my control ward super safe and in a ideal location which helps the team. I always fight for my ward, maybe thats why it stays up so long.\n\nBut it also makes it look like i am a bad warder =( sometimes i buy two and never get to use the second one, or place it just because i can.\n\nI still think we need control ward to be a item slot for its self, so people can't have a full bag and say \"IM FULL CANT GET ONE\" i know i am guilty on that when i am an ADC.","replies":[]},{"poster":"gravityhacker","date":"2016-12-02T08:41:15.591+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Vision control is important and you should feel proud","replies":[]}]}
