To call NA one of the worst regions in the world you have to be joking right? I will say TL is under performing at msi but to even think that NA is completely shit is hilarious. If any NA team was to vs Dire Wolves we would get smashed cos all oce teams are completely trash compared to any other region.","replies":[{"poster":"kaboomblah","date":"2018-05-13T07:29:12.263+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I said \"arguably the worst region in the world\".\n\nAs for \"one of the worst regions in the world\"?

Season 1 was won by fnatic and season 2 was Taipei Assassins. Also just because 1 team is underperforming doesn’t make the region weak","replies":[{"poster":"kaboomblah","date":"2018-05-13T09:15:25.054+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Sigh.\nIt's like you're reinforcing my point.\n\nHere is my train of thought.\n1. To represent your region at MSi means you are currently the strongest in your region.\n2. TL is representing NA.\n3. TL fucking stink.\n4. NA's best team stinks.\n5. NA stinks.\n6. Also, teams that were required to participate in Play-Ins are demolishing NA.\n7. Sport is a meritocracy.
