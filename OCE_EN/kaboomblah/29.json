Had an incident where teamfight was more or less over. Varus was focusing me from full HP. No idea why because he was alone, I was on cooldown. Vayne is running away with me, neck and neck. Only attempt to do anything was a condemn away - not able to stun - after Varus landed 5-6 autos. Did not turn at any stage.\n\nThresh simply would not ward or clear wards. Supports who do this seem plentiful on this server, so I&#039;m not surprised. I think, honestly, they cannot figure out how to do it. Basically, if you believe your jungle is warded - which it probably is if they&#039;re ahead - go in there and use that red trinket, place some wards of your own. The red trinket does become available again, and wards replenish once you visit the fountain. I don&#039;t know why people use it so sparingly - or they simply don&#039;t know how to.\n\nPoppy was a no-show. Simply put, a non-factor for us. Fed + didn&#039;t contribute, unable to prevent Zac&#039;s initiation once, unable to really take a beating whatsoever.\n\nHowever, I think biggest culprit is Graves. Not being able to verse TF as jungler shows absolutely nil game intuition or knowledge whatsoever.\n\nUPDATE:\n\nAdd Poppy immediately and avoid at all costs. OP.GG tells me he has not bought a control ward since the dawn of time.","replies":[{"poster":"Captain Fortune","date":"2017-01-06T04:13:38.028+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Greetings kaboomblah,\n\nKeep in mind while I am sure you are making this post with the best intentions and not naming any names, you are asking poeple to try and avoid specific players through ways they can find out who they are. This can often lead to a witchhunt, rarely coming out with a positive outcome.\n\nAlways remember that in situations like these players can just be having a bad game or on tilt, which happens to all of us ^^\n\n---\n\nOnto the specific things you noted I know how it feels to have games like these, you feel like you have no control over what happens in the game and your teammates don't know what they are doing. However I think that there can be a solution that we can find as to why these players are playing the way they are.\n\n---\n\nFirstly let's focus on the Vayne that you mentioned. You gave an example of something you feel like they should have done in following you up and based alot of your opinion on that. \n\nIn this kind of situation try to see what was happening through the eyes on the Vayne. With thier varus being fed at this point I assume they were probably scared to re engage or didn't feel confident in being able to out play their opponent, so they thought it was safer to back off instead of risking a trade. This is completely understandable imo and if they feel that they don't want to risk something they feel will end badly, that can be a good thing.\n\nIt could also be that this is a new season, players are still learning how the new mechanics work and some players are choosing to learn new champions or roles. In this case they still could be learning Vayne which is something to consider. Everyone in league is constantly learning even at the pro level, just learning different things or at different paces.\n\n---\n\nOnto the thresh, simply put different people get to the elos they are through different strengths and weaknesses. It could be the case that while this thresh wasn't very practiced with warding, they could be amazing at hooking and punishing opponents when ahead. Other than that sometimes vision can be a very hard part of the game, it can be difficult to learn and some players decide to learn other aspects of the game first.\n\n---\n\nWith Poppy and Graves this could just be again the chance of them having a bad game. While you think it would be better to gank TF in mid, Graves might have a thought process that justified him ganking top. Vlad over extended, Vlad is scary when fed, he wants to snowball Poppy. As a few examples.\n\n---\n\nAll up it sucks to have games like this mate it really does. However people are still learning at all levels and it's important to understand that. Sometimes people are just having bad games. If you are able to push aside the feeling of frustration and isntead offer to give advice as you play you can help them improve as well.\n\nAlways try to keep the games you are in a positive environment. Even if people are having a bad game, if they are willing to work together, come backs are always possible and may happen.\n\nI hope that this helps. If there is anything you would like me to clarify further on or if you have any questions I can answer let me know, and good luck in your games.\n\n~Elam","replies":[]},{"poster":"Reginleif","date":"2017-01-06T07:27:39.069+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thanks for the heads up buddy! üëåüèª","replies":[]}]}
