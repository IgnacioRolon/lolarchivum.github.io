The only difference is that it's turned off for OCE early/mid morning (3am until 11am AEST) because Riot are adamant that the RGMQ can't be sustained (during those times) without negatively affecting queue times across the board given the smaller population we have compared to other servers.\n\nThat said, it appears Riot are forgoing the usual \"restrictions\" for the RGMQ and giving it to OCE (and other servers, I imagine) for the \"entire duration\" (which *may* include through the week, I guess), which is consistent with how they've handled URF (and ARURF) being in the rotation for OCE previously.\n\n> All Random Ultra Rapid Fire (ARURF) is back from 4:00 AEST 11/08/17 to 25/8/17 16:59 AEST (Yes, the entire duration!)\n> Source: http://oce.leagueoflegends.com/en/news/game-updates/patch/patch-716-notes#patch-rotating-game-mode","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Dr Cancer","date":"2017-08-09T11:11:04.118+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Same boad here... fav mode for me... not sure why they dont make it so people can vote throughout the week...","replies":[]}]}
