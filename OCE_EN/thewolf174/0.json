Currently the report system is showing a fairly clear level of failure to the degree that most intentional feeders I encounter doubt it even works. Not only this but people who submit reports have no way of knowing the level to which this is helping. I have reported many such toxic players yet have no way of knowing if this report has done anything.\r\n\r\nJust my two cents on the darkest part of this community.","replies":[{"poster":"Sneed","date":"2016-10-07T01:42:52.065+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"harden up and that will solve ur problems","replies":[]},{"poster":"lyasa","date":"2016-10-06T22:10:00.406+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Riot has been actually doing some improvements (i know some of this because i'm doing a research about toxicity in games for an essay), but about what you said about the report system, i never know when or if the player i reported, has a warning or if it's banned. Ask a request to Riot i would like for them to try and better those things. \n\nAlso sorry about the bad and not helping comment but it's the first time i ever discussed something in a board {{sticker:slayer-jinx-catface}}","replies":[]},{"poster":"Trustworthy","date":"2016-10-06T18:32:46.466+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Not sure about you guys i get frequent report cards from riot in the league client saying the people i've reported haven't improved and have been punished.
