I just think it would be nice for people to be able to get rewards of champions they are really into, or just something to look forward to once getting mastery level 5, other than a banner on the loading screen / in-game mastery emote. I know it probably seems like a really insignificant thing and perhaps only a few people would feel the same way about it, but I still think it&#039;s a nice idea, and so I am giving my idea out here on this post.","replies":[{"poster":"RonyStark","date":"2016-04-29T02:36:42.245+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"wow, much logic, very upvote, so ritopls","replies":[]},{"poster":"yeulx","date":"2016-04-29T18:42:52.777+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Eh i wish u would get the champion icon for a summoner icon for hitting max level or something i know smite does it but u can buy them but  the whole mastery scoring is basically useless...  i mean id love to have muh {{champion:103}} {{champion:143}} {{champion:99}} {{champion:34}}  ext. as icons Rito plzzz","replies":[]},{"poster":"raluca2","date":"2016-04-29T03:00:14.681+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Good Idea but I think people would prefer it if they got an icon after a certain amount of Champion 5 Masteries. It seems kind of pointless to do one for every champion and I'd rather Rito focus on something other than making icons for the 120ish champions.","replies":[{"poster":"CloudSkyXV","date":"2016-04-29T03:06:52.187+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I understand that, and I could see it working like that too. But I, personally, would prefer separate champion icons, and I do not think they would take that long to make if they literally just had them the exact same as the champions in game face icon.","replies":[]}]}]}
