I love support, I really do. But sometimes I just feel  like being assigned any other role than support. As in I don&#039;t want to preference just Mid/Top for example.\r\n\r\nAs it stands 90% of the &quot;Fill&quot; preference games I play end up being as support.\r\n\r\nWould it be worth trying something like having two fills? Like a semi fill that selects all roles minus support?\r\n\r\nAnyways just my idea.","replies":[]}
