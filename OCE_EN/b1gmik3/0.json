With all the same setting I am getting about 35 now for the beginning parts of the game when it is 1v1 in lane / small ganks. When a teamfight happens I am very frequently dropping to 4 fps exactly until the reamainder of the fight. This low fps sometimes holds through the death timer and goes back to 35-40 when I respawn.\r\n\r\nMy system information is as follows:\r\n\r\nModel: Alienware Laptop 17 (purchased in 2014)\r\nProcessor: Intel(R) Core(TM) i7-4700MQ CPU @ 2.40GHz   2.40GHz\r\nInstalled memory (RAM): 16.0 GB (15.9 GB usable)\r\nSystem type: 64-bit Operating System, x64-based processor\r\nWindows 10 OS\r\n\r\nI do not know much about computers but I do know these specs should be running the game fine as it has for the last 3 years. Please comment for advice/help as I know I am not the first person to have this issue. I desperately need some help.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance Summoners.","replies":[{"poster":"Captain Fortune","date":"2017-01-05T23:13:25.425+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Greetings B1gMik3,\n\nThis problem sounds like it could be linked to your laptop over heating, graphics drivers not up to date, software issues or other things that could be possibily effecting it.\n\nRiot did a list of these common things and more with instructions on how to fix them.
