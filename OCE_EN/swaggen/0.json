Lane bullies who have solid all-in-combos and/or can cc Yasuo very hard are prime examples due to Yasuo's poor base stats.\n\nAlways try to keep moving around somehow so you can build up his flow, allowing you to use your passive shield to make favorable trades via dashing in with E, auto attacking then dashing back.\n\nKeep an eye on the enemy minion waves. Pushing lane with Yasuo is very risky since he's very vulnerable to ganks. Also take note of the enemy minion waves so you can use E as much as possible during trades, and be very careful about pushing the wave (thus try to last hit with Q as much as possible if so).\n\nDepending on the matchup, you either max out E or Q. Maxing out E is mainly for most melee matchups, but if it's a rough matchup for Yasuo maxing Q might be better so you can use its raw damage to safely poke-farm from a distance.\n\nTry to often use E-to-Q to land you knockup; Yasuo's Q is not one of the easiest things to aim due to its narrow range, but you still have to keep an eye on which targets you dashed to with E so you don't limit your mobility.\n\nYasuo's build paths are actually quite versatile, but his forced item dependency makes him very bad mid game without any items for being able to sustain decent close-range-combat and/or use his ult to safely engage. The samurai has very expensive tastes especially with {{item:3031}} and/or {{item:3508}} being very expensive items overall.\n*With this in mind, you have to learn not to go too ham on Yasuo and learn to limit yourself as well as not trying to mess up too much by trying to land his Q as much as possible; Yasuo's Q forces his overall kit to scale with attack speed, so don't be afraid to auto-attack someone to death if you have enough attack speed (especially around 1.30-to-1.50). Going too ham on Yasuo may not be any option at times, so it's wise to play him as a peeler since you can use your Q-to-ult to get someone off of your main carry if needed, as well as using Wind Wall to block some vital skillshots that may target your said carry/carries.\n**Thus, carefully assess your situation before trying to 1 v 5 with Yasuo; it's wise to just stick with your team and to peel.\n\nSometimes you don't want to always press your attack if you land your ult; it's wise to just tag someone and just run away. Your ult has a decent cooldown anyways.\n\nIn regards to cooldown reduction, {{item:3508}} is not that useless on him imho; it works wonders for both his Wind Wall (W) and Last Breath (R/Ult) so you can use them as often as possible.\n*On that note, {{item:3078}} is great for more attack speed in 1 v 1's, movement speed for chasing and kiting via the {{item:3044}} passive and the {{item:3057}} passive works wonders on his Q to be able to proc it consistently (even if you miss a Q your next auto can still use it). The said {{item:3057}} passive is also great for both CDR and being able to take towers very fast by just Q'ing the air to frequently bring up spellblade so you can consistently land extra damage autos on an objective.\n\nIf you have 1 life steal item, {{item:3046}} or {{item:3087}}, and one final damage item, then you can devote the rest of your build to be tanky if you wish. Yasuo works great as a bruiser-type skirmisher.\n\nNowadays, it's wise to run full attack speed reds + attack speed quints ever since Yasuo's attack speed stat nerfs since a prior patch; attack speed during the early game helps you greatly and also frees up boot choices.\n\nI know I suck at Yasuo, but I've looked at a lot of different Yasuo tips and I myself am still trying to grind enough games on him.","replies":[]}]}
