Then I completely disconnect for about a minute before reconnecting back to the game. The disconnections happen roughly once every 15-20 minutes of in game time and also this happens when I play both game modes, but I stick to ARAM as I don&#039;t feel so bad if my game is ruined by such.\r\nHas anyone else had this problem and found a way to fix it?\r\nTried doing a full repair, nothing changed. \r\nThe internet works fine, I usually go on Reddit while I&#039;m disconnected from game.\r\nAlso around the same time this started happening, when I alt+tab in and out of game, it takes about 5-10 seconds of a black screen before opening back up. \r\nLove to hear your feedback\r\nFlaz.","replies":[{"poster":"Typhon","date":"2018-05-31T00:29:40.759+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"yeah ive experienced the same issue. your internet is fine but the server crashes on you. are you with telstra?","replies":[{"poster":"Yatsume","date":"2018-05-31T02:11:28.096+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"All of my mates with Telstra are getting the same problems, as well as the same disconnection at the same time :( Seems to be happening in majority of sydney","replies":[]},{"poster":"Flazman","date":"2018-05-31T05:52:05.453+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Sadly have no other choice.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Flazman","date":"2018-05-30T13:37:15.395+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Update: it happened just right now, I died under tower at a crucial part of a losing game, then disconnected... just waiting.","replies":[]},{"poster":"WOHC S","date":"2018-05-31T09:01:56.739+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"having the same problem every game.. pretty frustrating","replies":[]},{"poster":"BLAZAH","date":"2018-05-31T03:43:06.610+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It's a routing issue from telstra servers in NSW through to riots as far as i can see.\n\nhttps://boards.oce.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/help-support-oce/bPfLvjTR-network-issues-telstra","replies":[]}]}
