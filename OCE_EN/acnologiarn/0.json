On both of these instances, and prior occurrences, I&#039;ve noticed that I&#039;ve always gotten a 15 minute delay to queue instead of the original 5 minute delay. I read online about it and people say that it resets after 16-24 hours, which I can&#039;t really agree with since it&#039;s never gone back to a simple 5 minute delay for me. Even my girlfriend has her dodge delay reset.","replies":[{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2018-03-11T00:21:06.248+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"If your dodge delay hadn't reset I can only assume you had dodged the day prior, either because of a crash or bots or whatever. I haven't heard of or seen any issue with dodge timers floating around, so if there is an issue it's an isolated one.\n\nIf you're absolutely sure you hadn't dodged in the last 24 hours then I'd recommend you **submit a ticket** to [Player Support](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/requests/new) and they should be able to help you further.","replies":[]}]}
