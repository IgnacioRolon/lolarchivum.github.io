First of all, it takes 3 minutes to load in compared to the prior 10-15 seconds. I&#039;m not even joking, it takes around a minute to authenticate then 2 minutes to load in. Then, when I load in, the client hasn&#039;t loaded everything yet, basically looks like this: \r\nhttps://i.imgur.com/7BCGUdz.png\r\n\r\nDoes that for around half a minute to a minute, then everything loads up. When I go into a game, champ select is ridiculously slow and it sometimes doesn&#039;t let me change my runes, claiming me to be below Level 6, when I&#039;m actually Level 35.\r\n\r\nThen, oh boy, the in-game issues. I normally play with around 150-220ms ping, completely playable. But now, I&#039;d be lucky if I get below 330ms. Not only that, but before when it used to spike to that ping, the animations weren&#039;t as delayed. Right now I press a button, and the screen shows all the actions 5 seconds later.\r\n\r\nI hate this, I love playing League even though I suck, why Riot?\r\n\r\nI even reinstalled the game to see if I could fix the issue but nope. Nothing.","replies":[{"poster":"QAPLA","date":"2017-12-28T22:36:49.858+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I can stream multiple HD videos at the same time on my fiber net (with no buffering), but I'm getting over 13000 ping in game, totally unplayable atm.","replies":[]}]}
