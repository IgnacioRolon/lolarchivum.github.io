Can we buff his Q or W to compensate?","subforum":"GD","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Last patch and all through the preseason, Taric has been an absolute beast. He had been winning fifty-three percent of his games according to op.gg. Enter patch 8.2. Now that Guardian&#039;s early game has been nerfed and tanky supports everywhere have lost shield battery, Taric&#039;s winrate has slid from first to twelfth (!!) and is now sitting at a sad forty-nine percent.\r\n\r\nI know that shield battery was becoming a problem on rangers and Guardian was overperforming, but now Taric has become so squishy he cannot stand up to a level 3 Brand combo under turret. So, rito pls, I am asking for everyones favourite aspect - can we please buff up either his q or w in early lane so we can stay healthy under the rain of Lulu, Morgana and Brand Qs?","replies":[]}
