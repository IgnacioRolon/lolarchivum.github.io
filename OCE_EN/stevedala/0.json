I had to restart my computer and endure a memory check. After logging back in, I returned to my game immediately, and after working really hard from behind we won the game. I&#039;m convinced my contribution was invaluable, and yet after returning to the client I was awarded D-, 0xP and most stingingly -18LP for my efforts. I know these measures are in place to prevent afk and rage quit behaviours but surely this is a bit harsh in this case? Is there any way I can at least have this forgiven and my lost LP returned?\r\n\r\n*puppy eyes*\r\n\r\nSteveDala","replies":[{"poster":"SteveDala","date":"2018-10-09T06:20:47.512+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I resent the implication that I wasn't sure my computer was battle ready, there was no prior indication. You really think I would have queued up if my computer said \"WARNING I'M GOING TO CRASH IN 15 MINUTES\"?\n\nRegardless, I'm still trying my best to climb - I'm in my series now. I just wish it was more like the old system where it wouldn't count as a leave within reasonable constraints. I've had network outages and crashes before that I've recovered from, still won the game and still been awarded deserved LP. In a situation like mine, its as if I've won the game and then lost two more - it doesn't exactly motivate me to keep playing! It leaves a sour taste in my mouth and reminds me of how much more fun I have playing Fortnite, where it doesn't matter when or how I leave.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Domine Vindictam","date":"2018-10-08T07:57:18.729+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I know this is a late reply, I haven't been on the boards too much recently so sorry for that :(.\nSadly there are no \"cases\" in regards to leaver punishments, its that simple. \nYour computer crashing is not your team or Riot's problem (I know its a bit harsh), instead its a really hard and rather annoying scenario that every summoner wishes they never have to face (especially myself, being placed into high silver rather than low gold because of 2 afk team members in my last 2 matches). It really ruins the game, it may not be completely your fault, but you're still at fault for it. You'd be surprised at how many people do not understand this, even if you rejoin and carry the game, it's only right that you allow your team to win after abandoning them, but punishment will still be handed out, it's Riot Games' system now, and AFK/Leaver behaviour is not tolerated.\n\nI hope you keep trying your best and continue to climb the ladder, just try and make sure your computer is not having any mental breakdowns behind the scenes before starting a **RANKED** game of all things, pay attention to the PC Issues notification in your taskbar people!!! ;))","replies":[]}]}
