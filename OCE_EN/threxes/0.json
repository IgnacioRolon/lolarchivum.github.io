Like i heard horror stories that people have above 300 ping on OC server even users play from Australia. So i am wondering is it fixed and how is it now, Thank you!","replies":[{"poster":"Wuks","date":"2016-06-17T17:12:51.998+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"The issue doesn't lie with Riot's servers, but rather with poor routing with ISP's. From what I can tell, the network infrastructure in Australia isn't the best quality and could definitely use some major improvements. All in all, however, you should have a reasonable ping if you're in Australia playing on the Oceania server. If you're playing on the EUW server from Australia, I'd imagine a ping around 180-220, considering you're on a relatively decent network.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Lil Udyr Vert","date":"2016-06-18T07:57:04.095+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It is bullshit.
