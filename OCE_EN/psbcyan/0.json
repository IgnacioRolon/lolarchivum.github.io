Since the last patch my cousin and I have been having the same issue. Our ping is fine and my internet seems ok as my voice call doesn’t lag or anything, even did multiple ping tests to varies sites including oce.leagueoflegends without any visible issues. We both are in different states with different ISP’s. If so are there any known fixes?\n\nKind Regards\n\npsbCYan\n\nEdit: I think it’s the same issue as this guy is having:\n\nhttps://boards.oce.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/help-support-oce/XF2YNY9j-league-buffering","replies":[{"poster":"HV Lime","date":"2017-12-20T11:47:58.625+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hi I'm getting this problem too, happens every game usually once or twice. For a few seconds I can still move and issue commands but I don't get any feedback from the server, so I can't see other characters moving. My ping doesn't change during this time, it's as if I'm still sending commands to the server but not getting anything back for 3 or 4 seconds. Haven't had this kind of problem with other online games.","replies":[]}]}
