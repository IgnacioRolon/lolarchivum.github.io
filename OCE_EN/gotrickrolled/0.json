I am fairly sure the alternative has been mentioned a few times before, but replacing the \"Lock In\" with \"I'm Ready\" would allow more freedom in champion select and the ability to still change champion when readied up, and may help to give less sway to those people who tend to instalock.","replies":[{"poster":"Ing√©nue","date":"2015-02-11T22:14:12.516+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Teambuilder.\nIn your suggestion, people will still \"instaready\" so it doesn't really do much.
