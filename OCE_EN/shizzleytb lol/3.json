This kind of software has the potential to result in permanent suspensions/bans, without the possibility of a successful appeal. Basically, in using software such as this, you risk losing the account permanently. Also note that any software that provides an unfair advantage is an explicit breach of the [Terms of Use](https://oce.leagueoflegends.com/en/legal/termsofuse) and game rules, and will result in action being taken.\n\nIt's also important to note that software such as this has the potential to contain viruses, which may compromise your computer. Always be careful when downloading unknown software, and make sure you are using reliable anti-virus software.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Willy Donka","date":"2019-01-16T18:40:46.930+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Wait wait wait, so you're telling me that people have found out how to make custom skins even with that WAD thing that supposedly killed them?","replies":[{"poster":"ShizzleYTB LoL","date":"2019-01-16T19:15:19.033+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Oh yeah!
