The sad thing is that no serious consequence will happen to their accounts as the tribunal just isn&#039;t effective. I feel like riot should have temporary locks on the accounts of players which have have toxic or negative behavior in games.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTLDR: Ranked Que isn&#039;t competitive due to trolls, afkers, toxic players tribunal needs to be more strict and have actual punishments.","replies":[{"poster":"Lord Kylar Alice","date":"2015-03-26T06:41:15.187+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"I've been out of the loop for a bit but as far as I know there's no Tribunal for OCE, so it can't be buffed.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Lynxmetal","date":"2015-03-26T12:33:13.561+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"In all honesty it does seem to be far worse in ranked than it does in normals, probably because the trolls want you to flip out and react. In normals it's irritating because it wastes your time but you don't lose Lp for it, plus if your team/enemy team has a troll they're very likely to just surrender at 20. In ranked it's more annoying because you're losing hard-earned Lp so the trolls know you're going to plead with them not to feed, I think it's like a power thing, most people who play this game are teenagers and younger with no control over a lot that goes on in their lives so they like to go online and try and exert some power over some strangers on the internet.","replies":[]},{"poster":"GoldenTomat0","date":"2015-03-26T07:49:13.229+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"the tribunal probs doesn't feel effective enough because no server has one.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Attysu The Poro","date":"2016-07-12T23:51:24.808+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Lemme be the first NA player to state... lordi this happens in NA too, I hope something changes.

I just posted something similar minutes ago.  I recently moved to OCE from EUW and NA (would MUCH rather play there, but can't anymore because I moved from the US).  OCE is a horrible server with so many afker's, trolls, flamers, and quitters.  Without a doubt, the absolute worse server (EUW is terrible too, due to it constantly having technical problems).  Riot needs to start giving harsh player bans to stop things like this from continuing.  Or at least have another statistic that follows a player's \"gameplay reliance\" (like how often they get reported or go afk) and have people with similar numbers get matched together so people who actually are competitive and respectful can have fair games, while all the other toxic players get stuck with each other.  I can't see why this isn't possible (I would MUCH rather wait 3 times longer for a game, than play a 30min game with an AFKer/troll).  OR at least make it so the toxicity ranking is spread fairly on either team.  So it becomes more balanced if both teams have one person who is very toxic.","replies":[{"poster":"kJs","date":"2015-03-26T16:39:12.633+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I play in around Bronze MMR and I haven't had such a terrible match in months.","replies":[{"poster":"panda530","date":"2015-03-26T16:55:08.707+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You're extremely lucky then.

I'm fairly new to League, just started October and this is my first season. I was placed in Silver 5 on NA, and every game was what you say, just one side terribly inept if not AFK or otherwise. I played 100 odd games, ended up at Bronze 1 or 2, I forget now. Before I decided to just come to OCE for pings and since the people who were going to play with me on NA just never logged in. I've only played my placement match here, so can't compare direct experience. \nTL;DR But my experience on NA is what you say OCE is, to be honest.","replies":[]}]}
