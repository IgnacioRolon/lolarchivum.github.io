Bots have been in LoL  for years and Riot couldnt care less.     The amount of times this has been posted about is dozens and dozens -  and Riot will never respond publicly.   My guess is  they are powerless to stop it and don't care enough to even bother with it as their profits are not affected....   loss of bottom line would create action.     Bots have no effect on that so Riot ignores it.    Riot really are lazy programme designers, and proof of that is their pride and joy called Leaverbuster which is the epitome of laziness.    Write a post about how much you love riot and want to stream their game, I'm sure that has a much greater chance of being read by Riot than a boring(from their perspective) post about bots.\n\n\nI agree with you btw,,  the amount of bots sucks balls,,  as does Riot,  who don't give a shit!   have a nice day.","replies":[]}]}
