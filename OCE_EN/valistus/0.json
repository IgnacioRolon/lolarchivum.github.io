Duuuuuudee.... \n**People are free to play off meta champions and build whatever the ♥♥♥♥ they want. No method of testing to reach a certain 'ranked requirement' is ever going to stop that. **\n\nYour kda is absolute ♥♥♥♥ in most of your games, some could even argue that you are the feeder. \nYeah, I understand that once the enemy team is fed from your allies they start roaming and killing you repetitively and as a result kda drops significantly.\n\n Still, this isn't really an excuse. You have to keep asking yourself if you could have positioned better or warded more (you ward a lot though, good job).  I would also check your item builds (it will help you get the kills more easily), modify them to complement the natural powerspikes of the champ you are plays (BoRK does not suit every champion and in many of the match ups you built it into, there would have been more suitable choices)","replies":[]},{"poster":"Project Xayah","date":"2015-03-10T09:16:51.734+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> why is there no requirements to join ranked games?\n\nGuess that means you don't have to be level 30 *or* own 16 champs then.

I don't think normals wins or anything like that matters. You can see the people in Bronze 5 with 15K ranked games played shows the number of games means very little.
