If a player is being negative towards you, I strongly encourage you to mute that player and report them in the post-game lobby. Negative behavior isn't acceptable in the community, and you'll be contributing by showing that player that their behavior isn't in line with the community's views and values.","replies":[{"poster":"valistus","date":"2015-12-18T07:29:07.897+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"i was able to accomplish my goal with some clever overlays for my my music players etc :)","replies":[]}]}]}
