I queue, I select champion & then after I'm in game around 5 seconds in I get disconnected from the game with an error message saying '**league of legends tm client has stopped working**'.\r\n\r\nWhat I Have Tried So Far:\r\n\r\n- Repairing League of Legends Client\r\n- Uninstalling & Reinstalling League of Legends Client\r\n- Checking Updates for All Drivers\r\n- Run cCleaner\r\n- Turning Off Windows Firewall\r\n\r\nIf anyone could help fix the problem it would be great, I really have no idea what I need to do to be able to play LoL again.","replies":[{"poster":"Spidey Sense","date":"2015-03-13T10:12:35.937+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"If you're running Windows 10 Preview, that's your problem, same as me.
