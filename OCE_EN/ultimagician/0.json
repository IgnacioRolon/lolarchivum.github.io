Supporting many games across many time zones. We strive for constant improvement with feedback from members and consistent communication with staff. This is to provide the best possible community for our members.\r\n\r\nAGC began in July of 2016 and has since been exciting and fulfilling. We have grown to over 500 members and welcoming more every day. Our community regularly holds tournaments with winners awarded with some RP!\r\n\r\nWe care a lot about the standards each member sets for the community and we want to ensure a fun and enjoyable environment. As such we have a set of rules and guidelines we uphold each and every member to. As well as a three-strike punishment system to those who consistently fall out of these guidelines. However we proudly report we have yet to punish any member!\r\n\r\nAGC welcomes any and all gamers looking for fun, care-free gaming or a team-based competitive environment. All we ask is that members be a minimum of 13 years of age and have a working mic &amp; headset however exceptions will be generously made as we do not want to exclude any member.\r\n\r\nIf you would like to come say hi and play a few games with us then please join us at : https://discord.gg/UYWjmWx\r\n\r\nSee you soon!","replies":[{"poster":"LunaLovegood","date":"2017-08-04T12:33:52.334+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Add ability for free coaching btw","replies":[]}]}
