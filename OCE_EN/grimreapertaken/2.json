Just sharing a solution I have used to fix my client and my mates clients when they refuse to work.\r\n\r\nProblem\r\n\r\nI&#039;ve noticed lately a lot of issues where people can&#039;t download patches without it crashing, people clicking &#039;launch&#039; and it greys out and just never loads and most commonly people getting &#039;unspecified error&#039; messages which just ruins your day. I also find that while there are plenty of people complaining about these issues very few of them ever get a reply with a solution so I figured I&#039;d share my experience to try help people.\r\n\r\nSolution\r\n\r\nWhen you start your client look in the top right and see your current region the click the dropdown and change regions. I personally change from OCE to NA but other regions should work too I just have not tried them. Your client should then update when it changes regions and then you can change the region back to your region (so in my case from NA back to OCE). When you are back in your region it should work, the patch will have been downloaded hence avoiding the crashes when updating, the unspecified errors that my mates and I have encountered have all been solved by this and the greyed out launch button also gets solved.\r\n\r\nI have not got a clue why changing regions solves most of the client issues but it seems to be the fastest/easiest solution for people that don&#039;t want to mess with files/save locations or uninstall/reinstall. \r\n\r\nHope it helps!! :D","replies":[]}
