Problems arise so often, this is one I havn&#039;t seen in a while but it&#039;s good to know it is still around. This screenshot just shows me sittiing in lobby waiting for the game to start and apparantly everyone else left the lobby. \r\n\r\nI have closed the lobby by now which has warned me i will be punished for leaving a game (fix your systems) and league just won&#039;t work, I&#039;ve started it up and even rebooted my pc, it&#039;s just dead. Like, there is nothing more I can do. Riot&#039;s client has broken itself to such an extent that I don&#039;t know if my team is ingame waiting for me, if we all crashed, if i am not in low priority queue for &#039;dodging&#039; and i can&#039;t even check. It&#039;s not fun when you decide to pop on for one game of the day and this happens.","replies":[{"poster":"brokenrose","date":"2018-07-14T10:37:42.103+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"i agree. this fking oce riot doesnt work hard.","replies":[{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2018-07-14T11:56:07.635+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Aside from the fact that issues like these are usually caused by local (on the player's end) factors, the OCE Riot teams have nothing to do with the client development, only the localisation. I also have on good authority that they regularly and voluntarily work overtime to fix things/keep things running smoothly/get things done faster/whatever else needs to be done.\n\nFrankly saying that Riot OCE doesn't work hard is a gross misrepresentation and really not fair or warranted in the slightest given the context of the thread.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2018-07-13T10:57:33.550+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"If you're having problems this regularly it is more than likely an issue with your install, your setup, or your connectio.\n\nFor install issues, run a client repair, and if that doesn't work run a clean reinstall with the Hextech Repair Tool: https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/224826367\n\nIf your playing on a low-spec machine I'd recommend turning on low-spec mode and \"close client while in game\" in your client settings.\n\nFor connection issues, run through some of the steps in this article: https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues\n\nI'd also recommend updating your graphics card drivers if they aren't already up to date as old dirvers can cause all sorts of issues.","replies":[]},{"poster":"GrimReapertaken","date":"2018-07-13T06:56:05.094+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Update.
