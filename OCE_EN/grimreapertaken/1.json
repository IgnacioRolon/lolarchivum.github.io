I ganked when aatrox was just out of rangee of my tower as he was pushed and had not warded, I dropped the E on him and auto attacked for the stun, then I ulted him and pulled him to the tower. This whole time Sion was auto attacking and I think he might have done his knockup attack but he ended it early so he just slowed. \n\nAatrox did not have his passive up so he wasn&#039;t going to live but when he jumped in the air Sion and I saw where he was going to land and we started to move to it but Aatrox never came down. It is usually like a second to jump up and com down but this time there was 2 or 3 seconds of &quot;wait for it, wait for ..... where is he?&quot; then I scrolled back over just in time to hear him die to a tower shot and fall down. \n\nAfter this he had a bit of salt in the chat and mega tilted for an easy win but yeah....\n\nI&#039;ve never seen it before but he seems to have jumped up and hovered then been killed by 2 shots from tower. Let me know if this is a new ability but i feel like it&#039;s a bug xD\n\nEnjoy your day all!","replies":[{"poster":"DarkShade918","date":"2018-06-13T09:31:26.653+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Flash cancel maybe","replies":[]}]}
