Are there things that I need to change to win or something?\r\nI&#039;m fairly confident to say that I win most of bot lane, but the end result doesn&#039;t work out that pretty.\r\nYou could check my history and although I have shi**** win rate for most, I know how my champions work and go positive most of the time.\r\nIt&#039;s only that I&#039;m beginning to realise how much of a struggle it is to climb as a support main in a solo queue.\r\nI&#039;m pretty sure I&#039;m below like 100 MMR average, so that could mean Im hard stuck in elo hell.\r\nI&#039;ve been trying to figure out what has gone so wrong for me but I just can&#039;t find why.\r\nHelp me :c","replies":[{"poster":"Hellopolite","date":"2018-07-26T00:45:43.124+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"if the games shit change something or suffer a slow death, u might still lose anyway, but ull risk a win at the expense of maybe ur kdr and the loss u were gonna incur anyway, recognise the loss, double down","replies":[]},{"poster":"Ing√©nue","date":"2018-07-26T00:43:26.864+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It's super common to hit this kind of slump as you edge closer to D5. \nIt's where the games become a little more unbalanced due to the smaller population, and where you are going to get a lot more punished for a small missplay than you would in mid-low plat.\n\nIs diamond your goal? You could be getting a little more sloppy as you get closer towards it, as your excitement takes over. \n\nThe other thing I can see is your champion pool. While it isn't necessarily bad, you  could have a slightly easier time playing something that is currently meta. It will also help synergy in your lane as it is likely your adc would be more practiced playing with a brand or zyra support at the moment over something like karma.","replies":[]},{"poster":"00shots00","date":"2018-07-25T22:54:11.643+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"its just meta changing and the roles that matter dont anymore","replies":[]}]}
