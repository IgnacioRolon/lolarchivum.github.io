This increases the chances of earning keys and shares chests earned among the party members.\n\n[Here](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/207884233-Hextech-Crafting-Guide)'s a useful link you might want to read on the Hextech Crafting system.","replies":[{"poster":"Lurenza","date":"2016-03-31T01:39:30.059+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Just wondering, how much do pre-made ques increase the chance of earning keys?","replies":[{"poster":"Tele","date":"2016-03-31T02:36:28.271+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"There's no official announcement on this sadly. **Riot** has chosen to hold this data privately for now.

Fairly decent IMO.
