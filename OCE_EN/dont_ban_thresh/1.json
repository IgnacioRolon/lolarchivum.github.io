Bahaha\nJust recently, I reckon, this server got more toxic and all that, so I&#039;m just thinkin to myself that the punishments should be a lil&#039; harsher.\nJust my own thought,\nHave a nice day ya&#039;ll!\n\nEDIT: Oh I also forget to explain that when I say taking this game 'seriously', I meant it as more of a 'personal' and 'offensive' way. Like let's say whenever a jungler fails a gank, the response is usually 'Go f***ing hang yourself' or 'Hope you get a ca***r'. I don't think it's right to flame anybody with some stuff (If you know what I mean) regardless of how mad you are. I mean, the most common one I heard was about somebody hoping the other to get cancer, like I don't even find that funny.","replies":[{"poster":"Venum","date":"2016-03-08T11:36:42.670+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":5,"body":"***","replies":[{"poster":"Fuk ALL Taliban","date":"2016-03-08T11:48:13.575+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"Wtf? this naut and his friend trolled us all game, they change there names with me and my duo friend. wtf!!!\n\noh no we have been framed!!!!

If you lose lane on your own in a 1v1 situation, that is your fault and your fault only, if you lose when getting ganked, sometimes you are to blame, depending on the situation, a few ganks from the enemy jungler and that is still your fault.\n\nHowever, what I was experiencing was a bot lane duo who have one of the worst records of games played I have seen, no pings, period, no roaming, and losing their lane faster than myself even with our jungler ganking for them. I than had our jungler refuse to help me for WHATEVER reason, yet still complain when I was losing lane to 4 of them.\n\nNo matter how many wards I were to place, no matter how defensive I was to play, the simple fact is this: You CANNOT defend against 4 players, you cannot survive against 4 players, the only way you are going to do so is if you actually leave your lane and retreat. Even under your tower means nothing in a 1v4 situation.\n\nI am not complaining about losing my lane, I am complaining about the asshat jungler who refused to help me, than blame me for the entire lose of the game, It is a so called team game, not a \"it's your fault\" game. Some players need to look at what is ACTUALLY happening in game and shut the fuck up.

It is just so that this time I had the jungler and you decided to yet again lecture me on how the jungler works, which is also typical of this community in that assuming players who make complaints are just bad and need to be lectured or taught how to play.\n\nI try to make a point that there are assholes who simply play the blame game instead of either helping, or if they can't help, shutting the fuck up and realising that when someone loses lane it is not always that persons fault. There are a raft of issues why from being over ganked, to being counter picked, to being matched against a smurf.\n\nI will say it again, come into my games and see the shit I get. Last game I had a Pantheon going 1v5 and yet again playing the blame game, not just with me because I actually had the least deaths, decent kills and most damage and CS.\n\nIn the after game it went a little something like this:\nPanth: \"Bronze 5 forever\"\nMe (Malz): eh, Panth, you didn't play too well (he was regularly trying to 1v5 just to get a kill on a low health enemy or chasing halfway across the jungle)\nPanth: \"same\" (in response to me telling him he was not playing well)\nPanth: \"Who fed Ekko?\"\nME: I didn't, I had the least deaths\nEkko: No one fed me\nPanth: Who ulted Sion?\n...\nAnd it went on, instead of realising he was over chasing, went 1v5 a few times and was never really playing as a team, all he done was look at whoever else and try to blame them and pick at them for why he lost a match he did not deserve to lose.\n\nHe targeted at me because I was the only one left in team chat that was actually saying something and he knew he was going to get a response. But when the responses he got did not vindicate the reasoning as to why we lost the game, instead of accepting the fact he was part of the reason we lost, he simply said \"Don't talk shit, u suck\" and left. Which is very typical of a low rank player, if they cannot get what they want they will just ramble nonsensical shit and leave.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Dont Ban Thresh","date":"2016-03-05T00:25:35.448+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"This one is true, yes.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Dont Ban Thresh","date":"2016-03-05T00:28:15.625+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yeah, I mean even spending so much on a 'game' that will eventually disappear might be a too much for some people.
