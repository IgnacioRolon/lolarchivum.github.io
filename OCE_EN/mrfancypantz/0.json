As for the chat logs you've provided, I'd imagine the *main* thing that would have triggered the punishment is your final statement from the post-game lobby:\n> MrFancyPantz: report for feeding lol fuck me quit the game pedo\n\nThere are several behaviours that Riot take very seriously (suicide encouragement, racism/sexism etc), and I'd imagine that calling people \"pedos\" would fall squarely into that \"serious offence\" category. Though not much, your chat logs aren't positive, and are basically just a few complaints and degrading your team mates. Most people don't want to deal with that in-game, and that just added onto the final statement you left them with. Quite frankly, I don't see any issue with you having received a punishment for these logs, seems like the system did what it should have to me. This isn't an \"sjw\" or \"pc\" thing, it's just a \"common decency\" thing.\n\nAs far as appealing the ban goes, you'd need to submit a ticket to [Support](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/requests/new) (use the \"Account suspensions or restrictions\" option) and let them know you want to appeal the punishment. As far as *successfully* appealing goes, the only way I could see that happening is if your previous punishment was *not* a 14-day ban, and even then you'd only have the punishment dropped a tier, rather than removed altogether (and if that happens, you'll still be on thin ice).\n\nBottom line is that *you* did the wrong thing, and so *you* got punished for it. Whether the other players did the wrong thing and subsequently got punished is a different issue, and if you want to discuss that you're better off doing so in a new thread (though keep in mind that the boards has a \"no name and shame\" policy, so use of summoner names would result in the post(s) being edited [to remove the names], or even deleted outright in a serious case).","replies":[{"poster":"MrFancyPantz","date":"2018-08-16T08:54:04.002+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":3,"body":"I'm reporting you for this post, it hurts my feelings and degrades me, enjoy your \"perma ban\" because thats how riot sees it","replies":[{"poster":"Project Xayah","date":"2018-08-16T11:41:33.889+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"{{sticker:slayer-pantheon-popcorn}}","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"TheDemonEmperor","date":"2018-08-19T00:52:05.865+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> MrFancyPantz: **laters**\n> MrFancyPantz:** facebook and youtube time**\n> MrFancyPantz: reporting team for making this game boring\n> Post-Game\n\nRage Quit; And you are wondering why you've recieved a perma banned? \n\nAm pretty sure you've rage quitting games consistently.
