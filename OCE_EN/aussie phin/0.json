I&#039;m looking at the new hextech items for teemo (yes go on, hate on me) and I&#039;m wondering if the GLP-800 would go well with Muramana. I&#039;m not very good at figuring out this stuff from trying in game, but to me it makes sense that the passive on GLP-800 that restores health on mana usage would apply to Muramana&#039;s passive of consuming 3% of mana for single target spells and AA&#039;s.\r\n\r\nThanks!","replies":[{"poster":"WE WUZ KINGZ","date":"2016-05-06T08:40:20.352+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Health gain is capped per spell or per second on toggles","replies":[{"poster":"Aussie Phin","date":"2016-05-06T10:54:27.356+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Muramana isn't a toggle any more though.

No his spells won't give a whole lot of healing but if you build attack speed as well the healing from the aa's would be alright.

Well you would build Muramana on champions like Ezreal, Jayce and Urgot who are primarily considered AD champions.\n\nAlso you have to consider that the item GLP-800 doesn't really offer AD but instead gives you AP that you really don't need. The fact that you won't need the AP makes the items benefits become weighed down by the sheer costs. The passive offers decent sustain but I think if you were to Opt for this path you would be much better off going seraph's embrace. If you're playing an AD champion you'd be much better off picking a frozen fist or maybe even a frozen heart or just simply more AD items.\n\nI think the restoration passive isn't quite that useful since muramana's passive that consumes mana only procs against champions while also already having a passive that mitigates mana cost.

I was thinking of using this itemization for teemo as he is an ap aa champ rather than any ad champ. I like getting the GLP-800 now anyway for all the stats plus the icy bolts are awesome. It was the passive health restore that got me thinking about muramana and if it would be a good combination on a teemo. I can really think of any ap aa champs off the top of my head.","replies":[]}]}]}
