Lich banes passive is an on-hit effect and I was thinking that if you say used those two items on teemo and went AA-Q-AA that rageblade would make the lich bane passive go twice. I looked rageblade up on the league wiki and it listed on-hit stuff that rageblade would work with and it listed on-attack stuff that doesn&#039;t work with it but lich bane isn&#039;t listed in either.\r\n\r\nAny thoughts?","replies":[{"poster":"WE WUZ KINGZ","date":"2016-06-06T06:15:42.565+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"take out lichbane, add other on-hit that has better synergy like Wit's End","replies":[]},{"poster":"YellowBrickRoad","date":"2016-06-05T21:54:00.964+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"To give an explanation of the mechanic while yes rageblade will proc on-hit effects twice the sheen procs arent on hit effects in the truest sense of the word.\n\nThink of them more like an empowered auto attack that gets triggered by any and all abilities.\n\nOr for a more mechanical explanation.\n\nThe sheen proc is an on hit effect that consumes a charge to proc, using an ability generates a charge allowing the onhit effect to be procced, rageblade will try to proc it twice but only the first hit will proc as the first hit consumes the charge meaning the second hit doesn't have a charge to proc the sheen.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Niji","date":"2016-06-05T18:06:22.541+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"None of the sheen items will be triggered twice, Things like both Hydras and BotRK will proc twice however.","replies":[]}]}
