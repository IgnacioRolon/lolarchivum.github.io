Are we likely to see the same downtime as NA has experienced as the patch is migrated?\r\n\r\nHave looked for net issues with other services but the fact remains that the lag is only occurring with league of legends and began since the implementation of the new map.","replies":[{"poster":"Rok","date":"2014-11-23T10:41:27.787+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"nope, confirmed been getting ping spikes up to 400 ping when no one is home or on the net. Never had these smaller amounts of ping spikes since 4.20.

On the client side of things, between when we released to Team Builder, and when we released to Normals and Ranked, we released fixes to a few performance issues that were found with the updated rift.\n\nThe recent NA downtime was actually for some planned hardware maintenance, and was not directly related to the 4.20 update.\n\n-Mindstar","replies":[]}]}
