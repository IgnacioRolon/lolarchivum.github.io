You&#039;ve heard it before, but MY GOD, I am pissed off at this community.\r\n\r\nSPECIFICALLY I am pissed off at Riot for encouraging a toxic atmosphere by not genuinely cracking down on player behaviour.\r\n\r\nWhen I play the game - even in normals - I play to play the game. Not to win. I&#039;m even ok with losing. I play for the joy of playing the game by the way of the meta. I&#039;ll even accept &quot;non-meta&quot; choices as my opponents because everything is possible, and some combos work out despite not meaning to.\r\n\r\nBut my GOD I am pissed off seeing how much Riot does not care about their players, and ignores the community asking them to fix the people. If there is anything that makes me uninstal my game and walk away, it&#039;s the fact Riot allows toxicity in their games.\r\n\r\nAnd yet it could EASILY be fixed.\r\n\r\nThe game could detect anytime a player writes &quot; kys &quot; (specifically noting when kys has a space on either side of it, or kys. with a full stop - or any variation of this). It may not implement an immediate action, but the notification could be assigned to a person who checks the conversation before and after to decide if the KYS was a legit death threat or not.\r\n\r\nThe same could be done for a pile of other inexcusable terms. And the advantage of it is that RIOT would take charge of it instead of the players (i.e.: instead of players filing reports, the game itself would identify questionable actions and behaviour). The stress would leave the players, because at this point I think the community agrees the &quot;report&quot; mechanic does nothing anymore. Because people feel useless in using it, they chose to not use it, which makes it continuously even MORE useless!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSame as the above &quot;chat check&quot; (I mean come on! There is a profanity filter in play - its obvious the system can detect that AND could be made to detect other things), the system could identify constant AFK&#039;ers (aka bots). If a &#039;player&#039; goes afk multiple times in a day/ week or whatever, outright delete that account! Make it a BIG number of AFK&#039;s so people with bad connections aren&#039;t punished, but do SOMETHING to recognize bot accounts and get them removed from the community. Again, giving a &quot;third program/ cheating report&quot; option doesn&#039;t help.\r\n\r\n\r\nFurthermore, drop the surrender time. Locking people into a 15+ minute hell because they got trapped in a game with a duo of trolls who are playing NOT for the game, but to take joy in seeing how much they can annoy 3 strangers, is just sadistic of your design.\r\n\r\nMake your &quot;unanimous&quot; vote available at 10mins. Make your 75% vote at 15mins. AND make a 50% vote (i.e 2/4  or 3/5 players say yes) from 30 mins onwards. Games typically end around 30mins regardless, and if the majority of players want out/ want to get away from a pair of trolls, the sooner you allow them freedom the better the game will feel.\r\n\r\nAnd if you don&#039;t make it universal, make it an option at least to be chosen by certain players. Not everyone wants to be locked into a game for that long, so give the option to make the game more casual and less entrapping.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAlso drop the damn emote spam option. Its a pet peeve of mine (and yes I mute my eneimes and allies when they do it) but again it just allows more ways for players to annoy each other instead of playing the game. Or, if you&#039;re going to allow emote animations, why not have em act as a minor stun effect so the animation plays out completely (and maybe gives you a 20 hp heal for completing a taunt?). OR have it so the taunt animation has a cooldown (aka no more freaking emote spam!!!)\r\n\r\n\r\nI REALLY do like the idea of league at the mechanical level. The champions are good. The gameplay nice. The concept good. But the players just make it hard to like. I NEVER recomend the game to my friends. I warn people from it. I ONLY play it when I&#039;m struggling in life cause it allows me to balance my pain out (kinda like how people turn to drink or drugs, I turn to high competitive video games as self-empowered punishment).\r\n\r\nP.S.: the honor a teammate system is definitely great. Maybe follow it up with a &quot;want to be matched again&quot; option? Nothing as commital as friends - just &quot;I liked this player. I would like to play beside them again&quot;.\r\n\r\nEqually a &quot;don&#039;t want to play with/ against this player again&quot;. It won&#039;t outright prevent you playing with them, but would reduce the chances of you being matched up in games with them again.","replies":[{"poster":"SOOM","date":"2018-02-01T02:47:33.943+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I’ve wrote kys so many times on my smurf to test theory... nothing","replies":[{"poster":"ThatsBS","date":"2018-02-01T03:22:46.913+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=MysticLlamaZ,realm=OCE,application-id=T8eq2lFQ,discussion-id=6Nf79Mvs,comment-id=0002,timestamp=2018-02-01T02:47:33.943+0000)\n>\n> I’ve wrote kys so many times on my smurf to test theory... nothing\n\nIsn't it only if they report you the auto sweep happens for the bad acronyms ?","replies":[{"poster":"Ingénue","date":"2018-02-01T03:57:33.084+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"Yeah, people have to report you in order for your chat to be reviewed and a punishment to be handed out. \n\nYou'll actually find that a good portion community is pretty lazy or forgetful when it comes to reporting other players.
