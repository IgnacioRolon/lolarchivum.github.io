On behalf of all the players who did this- I apologize for our unmannerly conduct.\r\n\r\nHowever, I am a wee bit ticked off at how we need to buy Kassadin (if we do not own him already) to buy the skin. Cosmic reaver Kassadin looks epic, and I&#039;ve developed an insatiable greed to purchase it, but on the other hand, I&#039;ve been saving up for a significantly long time, to buy runes and champions to start ranked, and personally, I really don&#039;t want to blow my IP on a champ that was on low priority on my list.\r\n\r\nBefore you start to trash me for asking for free IP, I only play LoL twice a week, whenever if I wanted to or not. So, raking in IP takes a heluva long time (3 months to buy Thresh? No problem...)\r\n\r\nSo, to add more uniqueness to the OCE skin, would it be possible if the entire OCE community could get Kassadin for free? (but we would still have to pay money for the skin) I&#039;m sure there are many other people that are in the same position as me. I&#039;d say, this could encourage more people to buy the skin, and it would be a win-win situation for both Riot and the community, as the money is being donated.\r\n\r\nPlease take this into consideration!\r\nCheers,\r\n-Anserem\r\n\r\n(No hate please! There&#039;s no bad in asking Riot)","replies":[]}
