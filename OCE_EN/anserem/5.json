Ultimately, he didn&#039;t stubbornly hold on to his will, and instead traversed to the role as a full-damage support, which was much better than being stuck with a duo toplaner. However, it seemed that the Pantheon had also held held a grudge against the Renekton, and for the course of the game, abused his skills at League of Legends.\r\n\r\nThis is where the catch comes along- it appeared that the Pantheon was Chinese, as he frequently cursed the Renekton in Chinese, donning him with offensive tags, which he/she assumed that no one else could understand. (I was able to pick one or two up, due to a Chinese friend of mine.)\r\n\r\nAlthough I didn&#039;t report the Pantheon, as Atticus Finch states, &quot;You never really understand a person until you consider things from his point of view... Until you climb inside of his skin and walk around in it.&quot; It was obvious that he was having a bad day, and his use of derogatory language was kept at a minimum...ish. However, in cases where someone takes advantage of a different language, and vents their criticism towards a player in that particular language, should I report that summoner? Do you think that it is worthy of a ban/report? What do you guys think?\r\n\r\nCheers,\r\n-Anserem","replies":[{"poster":"Ingénue","date":"2016-05-01T00:51:47.344+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"For cases such as these, definitely utilise the end of game reporting feature.
