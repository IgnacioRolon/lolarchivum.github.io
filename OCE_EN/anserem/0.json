And whats more, I think my RP that I was so dearly saved up has finally found its purpose! However, I can't decide if I should get Tyrant Swain, (Awesome new animations, just a little costly, I have just enough RP) or Northern Front Swain (Russian Swain with a cockatoo/owl- 'nuff said.) So I need you guy's help. Please tell me which skin I should get! Northern Front Swain, Tyrant Swain, or just wait for the fabled Dragonmaster  Swain? (Which they confirmed in 2012...)\r\n\r\nThanks a lot! Feedback will be much appreciated!\r\n-Anserem","replies":[{"poster":"WeakboyLuvLadies","date":"2014-12-14T03:55:53.341+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"From my point of view I think The Northern Front Swain is good enough on its own, which means getting that is as good as getting Tyrant Swain. If you plan on getting another skin for another champion sometime soon, then I suggest getting the Northern Front skin just to make saving for him/her/it easier. Otherwise go with Tyrant.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Riso","date":"2014-12-13T06:08:20.083+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Get DRAAAAAAAAVEEEENNNNN Swain.
