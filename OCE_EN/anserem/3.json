(Rioters, feel free to look as well)","subforum":"Miscellaneous","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hi Everyone,\r\n\r\nRecently, I hit level 30, and I was planning to prepare myself for ranked. However, I am split in deciding if I should save up and complete my rune pages, or buy Thresh to fulfill my 16-champ requirement. (Note, I generally play top-laners and supports).\r\n\r\nNow, before you start saying \"Duh, what kind of question is this,\" please hear me out. I am only allowed to play two games per day, and I can only play on Fridays and Saturdays. So as you can see, earning IP takes a lot of time. On top of that, I am on a pretty big tilt, so getting IP for anything is extremely tedious and long.\r\n\r\nSo, I figured that my support champions are quite limited, with Sona being my only true support that I own. So, I really wanted to buy Thresh, but like I said, gaining 6300 IP takes a helluva long time. (Probably a good 3-4 months, if I manage to get out of tilt). So I need your opinion. Is it wiser to just concentrate my priorities on Runes, or refund a champ and get Thresh? (Btw, I can refund Ekko- I hardly play him anymore, due to the fact that I don&#039;t really play Mid Lane)\r\n\r\nMaybe, if some kind soul or Rioter will gaze on my pitiful post with generosity and gift me Thresh... wouldn&#039;t that be a dream come true?\r\n\r\nThanks a lot guys,\r\n-Anserem","replies":[{"poster":"Anserem","date":"2015-08-14T04:43:07.377+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thanks for your help guys- Looks like runes is the logical way to go!","replies":[]},{"poster":"Project Xayah","date":"2015-08-13T06:05:01.365+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"If the plan is to get ready for ranked you should have a good selection of rune pages, so if you feel you aren't satisfied with your current selection then runes is the obvious choice.","replies":[{"poster":"Chicken4dinner","date":"2015-08-13T12:00:50.264+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=HeartVine,realm=OCE,application-id=Ntey9fRZ,discussion-id=vsR9VOMX,comment-id=0000,timestamp=2015-08-13T06:05:01.365+0000)\n>\n> If the plan is to get ready for ranked you should have a good selection of rune pages, so if you feel you aren't satisfied with your current selection then runes is the obvious choice.\n\nRemember the shit I stirred when I asked about this?\n\nGreat times :')","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Chicken4dinner","date":"2015-08-13T11:41:02.610+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Anserem,realm=OCE,application-id=Ntey9fRZ,discussion-id=vsR9VOMX,comment-id=,timestamp=2015-08-13T05:57:07.889+0000)\n>\n On top of that, I am on a pretty big tilt.\n\nLook this right here tells me you are not ranked ready, \n\nHow do I know? \n\nWell for one I hit level 30 by playing full ap yas and going 13/22... while on a tilt\n\nI had one runepage that made no sense and when I jumped straight into ranked I fed every match but was carried in two...\n\nOne of them had a plat in it so I was placed into bronze 2 and not 3, but that is besides the point. \n\nThe message here is that now if I were to play ranked people will look at my history and go lol gg, bringing down the team's efforts because they believe that I spell death. \n\nDon't make the same foolish mistakes padawan, I play 4 _normal_ games every day now just to get good enough so I can become ranked ready and move beyond the toxic level of bronze\n\nFound this gem: http://boards.oce.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/player-creations/aVX67jbB-just-hit-30\n\nThis song also asks a very important question: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11s60makdoU&list=RDAD_rL4aZRJo&index=16","replies":[]},{"poster":"MrPine","date":"2015-08-13T11:14:41.142+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Without the proper runes, you're honestly not ready for ranked and putting your entire team at a disadvantage before the game even starts.","replies":[]},{"poster":"GoldenTomat0","date":"2015-08-13T08:58:02.388+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"runes. with better runes, your chances of winning increases. with more wins, resulting from better chance of winning, your ip gains will increase.","replies":[]},{"poster":"5318008","date":"2015-08-13T08:39:43.731+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"In your case I would go for champ first and get tier 2 runes until you have enough IP for tier3 runes\nThis is because you said the only true sup champ you own is sona and if enemy team picks her you have no other sup champ(unless you have naut or any other champs that can go sup meta)\n\nedit: my first champ bought was thresh and with tier 2 runes i was placed in silver 4 for my first ever placement","replies":[]},{"poster":"CptFurious","date":"2015-08-13T06:14:29.307+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Obviously, go with whatever will make you happy, but here's my thoughts:\n\n1) Having full and \"proper\" (ie - in-meta and top tier) rune pages are going to be pretty important both in ranked and normals now that you're 30 if only because you're going to be playing against people who WILL have those pages complete. It can make a pretty big difference, particularly in the earlier stages of the game.\n\n2) Full rune pages may actually help you in game, meaning better win rates which means faster IP gain! So the time it takes you to earn another 6300IP might be shorter.\n\n3) This one is a bit of a downer - but if you jump into ranked and people see you're playing without full rune pages you're probably going to run into some pretty salty players and may get some abuse thrown your way. I'm not happy about it - but that's the reality.\n\n\nPS - I'm a pretty casual player myself and am only on sporadically, but if you want someone to queue with or chat to in-game feel free to shoot me a friend request (IGN: CptFurious)","replies":[]}]}
