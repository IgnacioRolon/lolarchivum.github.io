So I&#039;m thinking of letting season 5 pass, and start ranked in season 6.\r\n\r\nHowever, a friend of mine told me that even if I haven&#039;t played a single ranked game this season, season 5 will still count as my first season, thus my MMR will be affected significantly the next season.\r\n\r\nCan some please confirm this? Rioters? Wise summoners?\r\nCheers,\r\n-Anserem","replies":[{"poster":"JasonWazza","date":"2015-10-07T08:21:10.369+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"First time provisionals your MMR is silver 4 area.\n\nThis doesn't change just because you were 30 and let a season pass.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Rocka","date":"2015-10-07T06:57:32.340+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"your mmr will not change because it is at the default at the moment i think its like mid silver i think.","replies":[]}]}
