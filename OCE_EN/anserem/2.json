Just a small question about DJ Sona...","subforum":"Miscellaneous","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hi there Riot,\r\n\r\nI was just wondering, since that DJ Sona is the new ultimate skin, what does the clues given by Wizardcrab and Morello about the upcoming Ultimate skin earlier relate to Sona? (As that would explain a lot)\r\n\r\nEarlier in August, there was a really convincing post, explaining that Shaco would be the lucky winner for the new Ultimate skin. (Courtesy to adminpwnsu, Check it out here: http://forums.euw.leagueoflegends.com/board/showthread.php?t=1855539)\r\n\r\n**The clues were: **\r\nSix S\r\nHide\r\nAssassin\r\nJ\r\n\r\n(According to Morello) The champion getting the Ultimate skin have \"A\" as the 4th letter of one of his abilities. (I understand that Sona's W, Aria of Perseverance applies to this clue)\r\n\r\nAnd finally, a post by WizardCrab: 541daw6s5d41a6s5d\r\n\r\nIf it could be explained, then it would be much appreciated!\r\nKeep up the great work Riot!","replies":[{"poster":"Mar3thyu","date":"2015-02-05T23:01:15.193+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"six s could be six skins or to do with how many s's in their ability's, skin names etc\nHide maybe means jukes or stealth the j points to jukes \nAssassin is to do with Assassin \nJ jukes or something to do with ability name or Jungle\nA Evelyn's Ravage \n\nEvelyn has 6's \nClassic (2)(her classic skin)\nSecondary  (3)\nShadow Walk (4)\nHate Spike(5)\nAgony's Embrace(6)\n\nHide:\nShe has stealth.\n\nAssassin:\nShe is an assassin.\n\nJ:\nShe can juke?? or Jungle :O\n\n\nI think I might have just solved the clues do I get a prize?","replies":[{"poster":"Hot Pope","date":"2015-02-06T13:27:18.801+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Illuminati confirmed","replies":[{"poster":"Mar3thyu","date":"2015-02-06T23:05:23.429+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Doin Rocks,realm=OCE,application-id=Ntey9fRZ,discussion-id=hhteFdl4,comment-id=00000001,timestamp=2015-02-06T13:27:18.801+0000)\n>\n> Illuminati confirmed\n\nSHHHHHHH I didn't want anyone to spoil it","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Fog","date":"2015-02-05T23:30:42.360+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The next ultimate skin has already been confirmed.
