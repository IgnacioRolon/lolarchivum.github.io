I don&#039;t know how to do it, but it was seriously unfair in my opinion. I never report anyone for swearing at me, and I only swear when people start flaming at me... I always get reported. This is seriously an issue, as my ban is a result of other people becoming angry with me in many games because I am not the best player. I try my hardest to do well, however if I fail I always get abused and flamed, and this causes me to react big time. I have been playing on this account for around 4-5years, and have spent hundreds upon hundreds of dollars on this game, supporting the company whilst simultaneously enjoying myself. I request a serious consideration with this perma ban. I&#039;ll happily take a perma mute instead to forever stop me from flaming my team members or the opposition in game (I can still communicate with my team using pings). Please Riot, I&#039;m sorry for what I&#039;ve said, but its not me. The community of people I play with turn me into someone I am not, and i would be humbled if you could please give me a second chance, or punish me in another form. A permanent ban is not the answer. &lt;3 Pls guys, help a fellow rifter out...\r\n\r\nThanks for your time...\r\nU 7 R I 3 D (formerly, Kazuto Kirigaya)","replies":[{"poster":"Wast3land ","date":"2016-12-03T05:21:41.259+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"[REMOVED **Don't Be a Jerk**] if you see someone getting bullied why the fuck would you just walk past and not report it, not reporting anyone isn't a good thing to do lol, only an idiot would think that. if someone is mean to you, /mute...Report simple process, you're too kind, this is the real world, this is the league community, not pre school where you are all kind to each other, if you aint gonna snitch, then thats your fault, and you can't say they should get banned as well because wooptidoo you didn't report them, bummer.

Let me try to provide some explanation about the severity of the punishment and why it probably won't be lifted. There is a lot of info [here](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201898070) about account suspensions if you're interested in reading further.\n\n\n>I only swear when people start flaming at me\n\nUnfortunately for you, this is still punishable. Although it _seems_ justified because you have been provoked, it still negatively impacts the game for the other people on your team and can often create a downward spiral of negativity/breakdown in communications. The support page I linked earlier says that _regardless of circumstance_ (i.e. whether you were provoked or not), swearing, harassment, abuse etc. will likely be reported by other players and punished by the instant feedback system.\n\n>my ban is a result of other people becoming angry with me in many games\n\nThis is incorrect. Your ban is a result of your actions in game, not because of other players. If they are being toxic, then they will also face punishment (just report them and move on). However, you cannot blame them for the way you chose to respond to their toxicity. \n\nAlso about this:\n\n>I never report anyone for swearing at me\n\nIt's actually a good thing to report another player if you believe their behaviour is unacceptable. That is how toxicity can be reduced in the community, leading to more positive experiences in-game. Just because you choose not to report players does not mean they show you a similar mercy! And of course there's no way to know if another player has reported you or not.\n\nUnless you were VERY toxic, I'm guessing that this is not the first time your account has been restricted. It has probably gone through two lots of chat restrictions and a two-week suspension. These punishments are designed to show you that your behaviour in-game is considered unacceptable by other players, and to serve as a warning that you need to reform your behaviour or lose your account.","replies":[]},{"poster":"U 7 R I 3 D","date":"2016-12-03T07:26:10.525+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thanks for all the real talk tbh... im not pissed about the account im just mad you lose all the money you've spent on it like that and you can't do anything about  it...","replies":[]},{"poster":"Project Xayah","date":"2016-12-03T03:41:45.397+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"In order to appeal a punishment you need to submit a ticket to support, found here: https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us\n\nAs for changing the \"perma-ban\" punishment to be less severe, that's certainly not needed. Players are given plenty of opportunity to reform by going through the standard punishment tiers and by changing that to be less severe (particularly removing the \"perma-ban\") you're basically saying that breaking the rules isn't that bad and enabling the toxic players within the game. There's no need for change there.\n\n> as my ban is a result of other people becoming angry with me\n\nNo, it's not. Your ban would be the result of *your* behaviours in-game. When push comes to shove, how someone else acts becomes irrelevant when talking about *you*. They will get punished for doing that kind of thing (as long as they get reported) and so will you. \"They started it\" is a childish excuse and you should not be condoning that mentality.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Fitzky","date":"2016-12-03T05:29:09.424+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"Another kid crying about a perma ban, nothing new here, move on","replies":[]},{"poster":"RonyStark","date":"2016-12-03T08:43:32.794+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It is amazing how this kind of thing changes our mindset not just in game but also in real life.\n\nI am not sure if Riot can unban you, and I hope they do.\nBut if they cannot, I want you to know that although this sounds like a loss for you,\nI believe in reality, you gain more since you can apply what you learn here in real life.","replies":[{"poster":"U 7 R I 3 D","date":"2016-12-04T06:08:20.357+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"not looking good, ive started leveling my smurf already brother\n<3","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Jahseh Onfroy","date":"2016-12-03T15:13:03.393+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You broke the rules buddy, face the consequences.","replies":[]},{"poster":"About 9 Kenyans","date":"2016-12-03T06:55:08.865+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":3,"body":"Bad luck dude, unfortunately riot is a very toxic company, but they are a company so its a smart way to make money from people that enjoy the game, what I would advise it picking a good moba with a good company, atm im the progress of recovering my HOTS account and blizzard is amazing and actually responds with direct answers not just \"you signed up so we own everything to bad for you\" and sarcastic remarks like they have little mans syndrome like riot, this games community will make you toxic over time as it does to everyone, best you can do is find a better game that you enjoy, DOTA2/HOTS/SMITE/STRIFE, better luck in the future","replies":[{"poster":"U 7 R I 3 D","date":"2016-12-03T07:28:44.826+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"never lucky man","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"nochillgamer","date":"2016-12-03T04:23:18.547+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":3,"body":"Good, we don't need toxic players.","replies":[]}]}
