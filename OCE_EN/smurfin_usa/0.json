Its called \"ikitaBot SR&ARAM\". \n\nhttps://s1.postimg.org/7y3lwhe1in/sssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssss.png\n^\nScreenshot of all the bots/scripts that this person called \"Burn\" has made, and is selling. Shut the website down Riot, or are you going to continue to ignore bots in your game like Blizzard Entertainment does?\n\nIf i can find this information in 2 minutes of google searching then what the hell do riot employee's do all day, twiddle their thumbs?","replies":[{"poster":"Plutooh","date":"2017-10-15T23:29:58.896+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Riot don't care about bots, it's ARAM they won't fix the issue until there is bots in ranked.\n\nRiot need to sell the game to a company that knows what they are doing to fix the problem.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Main Line","date":"2017-10-10T23:57:09.808+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I think it takes the automation at least a week to kill a bot, and thats only if people report it.

Apart from catching the bots faster, they could also change immature players behaviour a lot quicker.\nFor example, imagine if they were in a soloqueue game, and some guy was breaking the rules. They could warn them and if the player persisted, they could apply the punishment immediately. Then in the end of game screen they could have a chat to that player.
