Game 1 can be a surprise, game 3 as well if it happens, but game 2 (which is the money game for the vast majority of the matches I watch at least) was never a surprise when I used that page you linked to.\n\nThis was what the VODs page used to do very well, you never knew if there was a game 3 unless you specifically tried to watch it.\n\nI also noticed the LCS and the other top tier leagues got to keep the spoiler free pages, I guess we're just special out here?","replies":[{"poster":"Koyotee","date":"2016-06-04T10:31:34.168+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"That makes sense, even by browsing the VODs you could be potentially spoiled.\n\nFor the page on the site, we were trying to combine the Schedule and VODS - to make it a one-stop shop kind of thing.  But it certainly doesn't cater to your needs...\n\nDo you have some ideas for us?  I don't want to jump automatically into solutions mode and say what the direction should be before hearing your concepts.  Like you mentioned, is separating them like LCS into seperate pages the best solution?  Or perhaps have scores hidden by default, and you have to reveal them?  Or maybe something else I haven't considered.  \n\nIf VODs could be whatever you wanted, what would it look like?\n\nThanks for your patience with this, and taking the time to talk!","replies":[{"poster":"PrometheusLD","date":"2016-06-05T04:35:33.335+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Not sure whether to go here or on the new thread you started but it's a fairly direct response so I'll put it here.\n\nI think I've seen both those methods done. If I remember the LCS pages used to have a global toggle that'd switch you into and out of spoiler mode. From my point of view both do the job fine, they let me get to the games without giving me information I shouldn't have.\n\nIf VODs could be whatever I wanted, and this is an unlimited resources kind of concept, the whole esports site would basically be a point-in-time view of the league at the point where you're up to (either you tell it or it keeps track based on what you watch, jumps ahead when you skip matches). So for example if you've watched up to week X, game Y then you'd get a schedule page that has results up to that point and tells you who's playing after that but not what happened. You could have a standings page that gives you what the table looks like going into the match you're watching which is something I remember wishing I could have watching the VODs. This probably goes more to the casting but when they talk about the table implications of a match, without the standings in front of me it kinda goes right over my head, which is a shame because I love working through those scenarios. Unfortunately I can't look it up when I'm watching after the fact.\n\nThanks for taking the time to indulge me. I'm looking at how I wrote the first post and how I'm writing this one, and I think you've shown more patience than I have.","replies":[{"poster":"Koyotee","date":"2016-06-05T05:58:31.055+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"That is a very cool idea!  Having the site being able to roll back to a certain point in time.  Because it's not just scores that are spoilers.\n\nThinking out loud: The matches and articles are feasible, they both are explicitly tied to a date.  What would be a pain I think, is team and roster details - they aren't really tracked in a historical sense, changes are almost transient once a tournament starts.  Unless I work in reverse, and work from last match to see the players who were rostered for that match... Standings would face a similar issue, but that could be recalculated...\n\nANYWAYS, this is cool, and it's not utterly impossible! Seems like a more holistic approach to the problem of \"I missed last week\"\n\nIt's a bridge too far for the site as-is, but my action item from this conversation is to ensure this concept has visibility with eSports.  At minimum, it's a great thought experiment to explore!","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Koyotee","date":"2016-06-05T04:28:14.302+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It's been bugging me that your viewing experience was ruined, so I've tried to get something in before the games on Monday.  \n\nIf you go to http://oce.lolesports.com/?mode=no-spoilers the scores should be hidden for the duration of your visit.  \n\nWhen you want the scores back, refresh your browser or hit 'http://oce.lolesports.com' again.\n\nThis will be a super unofficial feature (and a bit rough).
