If that&#039;s true, I&#039;ll do that. For all the endless talk about new systems to improve the standard of people here the problem only ever gets worse and I am only ever on the wrong side of it. I am tired of reporting people only to get another AFK&#039;er in the very next game. Basic probability dictates that if I&#039;m not an AFK&#039;er then I should be in the 5 more than the 4, yet I consistently get 4 and even 3 man teams against full oppositions. Reporting these people clearly doesn&#039;t work because nothing changes and the response that this is just bad luck on my part has ceased to be credible. I just played two games and they were both 4v5 (at least) from zero to the time Riot would let me out without punishing ME. And that was an hour of what was supposed to be my LEISURE time. Instead it only left me angrier than when I started.","replies":[{"poster":"Katsprky","date":"2015-10-03T19:29:14.925+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"There's a notification to when someone gets banned due to your report to let you know that you've helped get someone knock out for awhile. Alongside that, it is completely random the best way to avoid people leaving on your team is to get a group that you know is unlikely to leave. Meet some new people through the boards and have some fun games on the Rift!\n\nAlongside that if you find yourself getting angry at this game you should take a break and play a more relaxed game, Cave Story is a pretty chill game that's free or you can buy it on steam (costs like $10 for better graphics and some touch ups) that has a good story. It might make you feel more relaxed and wait out your bad luck in the team select. - If you want a different game recommendation for another genre feel free to ask, I know a lot of pretty chill games.","replies":[]}]}
