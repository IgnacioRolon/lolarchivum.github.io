Its all online. The teams are made from a pool of players who give their rank and 2 role preferences, then we randomize the teams with fair and even ranks.\n\nWe&#039;re hoping to have casters cast the games for the day, and to stream the event (or atleast record it).\n\n\n\nAs per requested, by Little Witch Eve;\nBy casters, I would like two people to spectate the game, and cast/commentate over the plays, talk about win conditions, that kind of thing\nYou don't need any experience, by amateur I just mean not professional. \nBy streaming, the best case scenario would you stream it via twitch or youtube. If your internet can't handle that, which is cool, then just recording it on your pc and uploading the casted replay afterwards.\nYou'd be spectating the games, so you would see the champ select then have the 3 minute delay.\nI don't really have expectations, its more about just having two casters (two is better than one as it allows them to bounce off eachother) to talk over the game, makes the replays more hyped, and when we make highlights after, its better quality with casters.\nI'm not worried about exposure or view count or anything like that\n\n\nIf you need anymore details, or are interested, just leave a comment and I&#039;ll get back to you\n\nCheers\nBaguette &quot;I WAS IN ALPHA&quot; Lord","replies":[{"poster":"Psylock1234","date":"2017-09-09T11:56:32.564+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"can i give my rank and role here or somewhere else \nbut even if i cant do it here i still am i main adc i can support but im not very good i am learning top but im not confident as a top laner and im b4 and i was in s5","replies":[]},{"poster":"Akkordian Zoeve","date":"2017-09-08T09:20:08.082+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Would be interested. Could you provide more info? Do we need to be experienced (I know it says amateur, but even so...)? How would the streaming work? Are you screen-sharing, and then we stream it and commentate, or do we need to be a spectator? What are your expectations? Could you elaborate more on the role of a shout-caster? Why do you even want amateur shout-casters, since you won't get any exposure unless they're already stable on Twitch/YouTube/etc.?","replies":[{"poster":"Baguette Lord","date":"2017-09-08T09:47:19.717+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey man, I've updated the post to answer your questions :)","replies":[]}]}]}
