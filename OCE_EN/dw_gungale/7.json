Then players from that game (on both sides) should be given the option to A. review the match for evidence and B. to vote on a punishment if they are also in agreement.\r\n\r\nIn addition I think accounts should have a strike system. If a player has been reported for a particular reason they earn a strike. If they get reported again in a game afterwards they earn another strike. At 3 strikes they get a temporary ban. For continual offences the punishment gets harsher. \r\n\r\nThoughts?","replies":[{"poster":"Oman2","date":"2015-09-14T11:55:13.332+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The overwatch idea isn't bad, but it would need to be moderated heavily. If there's a 4-man that all hate the other guy on the team, then it's a potentially unfair punishment.\n\nThe strikes are an excellent idea though, it's a good way to slow unfair punishment. *But* they'd need to be for lesser punishments - if someone is yelling racist abuse and feeding for a whole game, I'd ban them on the spot, but if someone is harassing I'd give them a strike as a warning and then ban/mute them if they continue in other games.","replies":[{"poster":"DragonOfTheVoid","date":"2015-09-14T16:36:25.048+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I disagree if there is a feeder on my team who sed top or feed or mid or feed and they feed im gona flame them like crazy don't ban me for flaming the troll","replies":[{"poster":"Oman2","date":"2015-09-15T02:23:46.939+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yeah stuff like this will always need to find the sweet spot. That's why we need a tribunal, then we know stuff is actually being done about all the toxics we see. What people see as feeding may just be a one off bad game though, 2/10/5 is a crappy game but 0/20 is trolling. If we use the strikes the people who actually feed get caught, but people with a dodgy game get a second chance.","replies":[]}]}]}]}
