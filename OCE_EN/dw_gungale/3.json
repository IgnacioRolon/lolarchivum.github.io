Auto attacks are allowed if you&#039;re in range.\r\n* I imagine the match will end quickly so have several rounds start the match on the minute mark. \r\n* Have fun.\r\n\r\nI have no idea whether this would actually be fun. Good luck.","replies":[{"poster":"GigaPube","date":"2015-09-17T11:49:40.843+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"id rather just aram tbh","replies":[{"poster":"DW GunGale","date":"2015-09-17T12:11:55.299+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"To be honest.
