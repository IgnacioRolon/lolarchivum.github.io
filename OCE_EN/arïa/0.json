Do I start to earn/lose LP now? It says I currently have 0 LP so technically I can&#039;t lose any. Can someone please explain what happens from now on :)","replies":[{"poster":"Roguestoney","date":"2015-11-19T10:09:30.338+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Well yes now you can start to win / lose LP. Being on 0 the only thing you can lose is your current rank. so get demoted from silver 4 to silver 5. From memory you usually get 3 - 5 games on 0LP before you get demoted unless your hidden MMR is very bad.\n\nHope that was helpful any other questions let me know =)","replies":[{"poster":"Arïa","date":"2015-11-19T10:13:42.097+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Oh, I see.
