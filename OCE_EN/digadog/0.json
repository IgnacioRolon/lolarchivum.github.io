After a few ranked today I have finally come to the decision of  uninstalling this shit game. (I main adcs) but I also play other lanes. May be you are wondering what got me so triggered and struggle to deal with. First of all champions like fizz, lux, pantheon, Zoe, Kasai and so on...... they just ruins the game experience. I know you all think that there is always a counter play just like in the LCS but when it comes to bronze, silver and gold the situation is just not like that. For example when you are playing top and your mid laner is vsing Zoe and he feed the shit out of her there is just nothing you can do about that she will just roam and get even more kills. Since her ganking is so easy to secure the kill. This is only what zoe can do now lets look at fizz a broken enough champion that got buffed his w now literally one shot a half tank champion if he is full build and going ap of course also his ult has 1.1 ap scaling which means if you have 1000 ap your ult will do around about 2000 damage with the base damage. Pantheon just spam q in lane that deals almost a 7th of your hp each time even if you are building full armour. Lux just spam ult to deal damage since her ult is on a 15 secs cooldown (and this is not in urf) The laning of each line is also well made...... bot lane is literally an ATM for any other lane. Top lane ganks with tp bot lane flash and heals then jg comes one shot the adc even if its a tank jg. (couse it makes sense right? it&#039;s the adc how can you not get one shoted) Then you came back alive walks up to your lane and the enemy mid laner is already there...... anyways I do wish league players to have fun and not so toxic but this is it for me so good job riot keep up the hard work. you guys will kill the game by making all these very fair changes...... feel free to ban me I&#039;m not coming back any way......","replies":[{"poster":"Bookbash","date":"2018-08-13T21:30:15.216+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Without being rude, I agree with what Quinncest has said. If you are in low elo, you need to improve your understanding of the game. Lux is a weak unreliable champion, and Pantheon is hardly the bully that he used to be because of the way minions interact with spells now. There is also counterplay on the other-side of the map to dives. If your team are monkeys that do not take advantage of this, there's not much you can do about that. Player skill is at an all-time low, because the game has been dumbed down so much. Perhaps it was in the hope of attracting more casuals to the game which is fine, but it has attracted more casual **NOOBS** to the game. And in a meta where the worst player on the team can cause your team to lose, rather than the best player on your team can cause your team to win, it's not in such a great situation balance-wise. Then you factor in crappy matchmaking for a small region (teams will be statistically balanced, but one team will have their strongest player in the support role, and the other in a carry position, for example) and the problem escalates.\n\nHowever, the main problem with this game (and why they find it hard to balance) is that they cater to supports. There is simply too much damage on keystones and support items powerspiking far too quickly in the game now that they don't have to buy sightstones and green wards. Factor in the snowball effect that if your spellthief support cannot proc their item because the adc is trolling out of lane, then you can wave bye bye to vision control for your team.\n\nWhen you watch high elo streamers like WingsofDeath and Scarra, they will tell you about it. Wings also said that he wouldn't be playing the game were it not for the income he receives from streaming it. Dyrus, TheOddOne, NEACE have all pretty much stopped playing the game on their streams, and there are reports of many others.\n\nI don't know why the Riot Balance team just don't go back to a game where the balance was so out of whack (e.g. patch 4.18) and try to examine why it is now, and what the differences are. They keep adopting band-aid solutions, or hardcore solutions every 3 months which give rise to more problems. Then they nerf-buff-nerf the same champion in consecutive patches (e.g. FIZZ, IRELIA), indicating that they have NO CLUE what they are doing. Kinda like Western teams at the World Championships. They simply don't understand the game.\n\nYou could leave the game, and feel a lot happier than dealing with crap. Or you could /fullmute all in-game, and just try to improve gameplay. Trust me it makes for a far better experience. That is, if you are a real gamer and not a casual.","replies":[{"poster":"DigaDog","date":"2018-08-14T15:30:43.567+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"lol what about the yasuo buff 150%---250% this is very well considered by riot again......","replies":[{"poster":"DigaDog","date":"2018-08-14T15:32:11.745+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"as a yas main I still find that is very unfair for his ult to have 250% ad scaling lol.......","replies":[{"poster":"Bookbash","date":"2018-08-14T18:20:55.248+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"P.S. I just noticed that in today's patch, some tanks are being buffed.\n\nDumb. Dumb. Dumb.\n\nThe point of Scarra's recent video on the subject of too much damage is that when two carries go head to head, its not a question of outplay or skill, its a question of who can dump their abilities on the other the fastest to chunk them out. There will be no outplay potential if damage remains high. So you can buff tanks, but the situation in the mid lane for example, remains. Again another band-aid solution. \n\nAnd I noticed that you can add Tryndamere to the buff-nerf champs category also, because they did not think ahead about ways that players could abuse the previous E cooldown buffs (fogged's AP build).\n\nThey still don't get balancing.\n\nThe question is, will these issues make you quit, or will you try the /fullmute suggestion in game?","replies":[{"poster":"DigaDog","date":"2018-08-15T01:07:54.190+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"lol I don't really want to quit after all I've played this game for so long.....
