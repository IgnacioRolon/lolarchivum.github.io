Is it because she isnt as popular as other champions or are there other reasons that she hasnt seen any love, there is no shortage of fan proposed skins for her, just would like to see if she is going to recieve anything any time soon.","replies":[{"poster":"Fitzky","date":"2017-10-27T22:44:14.943+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"They said on Ask Riot a little while ago that Illaoi and Cass and the rest of them would be getting skins soon so just be patient.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Azirious Mistake","date":"2017-10-27T21:24:44.509+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Give me Dragon Priest Illaoi or give me death.","replies":[{"poster":"Wuks","date":"2017-10-27T22:21:27.286+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"https://masksofmonsters.files.wordpress.com/2015/06/commodus01.jpg","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Cut","date":"2017-10-27T09:52:10.689+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I just want some Aurelion love!","replies":[]},{"poster":"DarkShade918","date":"2017-10-27T08:01:40.190+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"There was a leak on reddit, about a dunkmaster skin coming soon, but that's after the next champ is released, no date given as far as i saw","replies":[]}]}
