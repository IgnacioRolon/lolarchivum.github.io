I just find it fairly relaxing. Anyway, my friend said to me that I had potential for being a decent ADC. He himself used to main support, but now smashes it in the ADC role. He&#039;s the best {{champion:67}}  I&#039;ve seen in a while on OCE. So do any of you have tips for being a half decent ADC? \r\n\r\nNote: I&#039;ve played the role, but find it difficult.","replies":[{"poster":"SpawnTheCaster","date":"2016-01-05T06:03:28.560+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey A Wild Shuckle,\n\nI also find adc a hard role. First thing to do is learn how to last hit well, and I mean really well. Take no items and no runes into a custom game and just last hit. dont push just last hit until you notice you get majority. Then add a bot. Do the same thing but harras the bot inbetween last hits (dont kill them just weave autos) you should be focusing on your positioning and hitting from maximun range. When you are comfy with that, take it into PVP. Once again ADC is mainly about patience so farm up, and become a late game beast.\n\nIf there is something in particular you struggle with I may be able to help but overall best advice is be a good laner and always be aware of who is around you. You will be focused.\n\nCheers, Spawn","replies":[{"poster":"SephirothSG","date":"2016-01-05T06:08:23.807+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"This is excellent advice for anyone looking to learn ADC, hell it applies to a majority of roles.\n\nBeing able to last hit effectively is essential (Even as a support {{item:3302}} )","replies":[{"poster":"Mighty Mortein","date":"2016-01-05T23:34:10.873+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thanks, guys. I mean, I'm slowly learning how to farm, freeze waves and to push when possible. I've noticed too that junglers love ganking champions with little to no escape, so I've moved onto Trist/Cait. I feel so comfortable with these two champs. Even Lucian. I've also noticed I work well with a Leona or Morgana. I love supports with hard lockdowns, since they allow me free poke if I'm close enough. Farming doesn't seem too much of a problem for me seeing how Im able to get 70-90 depending on how aggressive the enemy  laners are. I'd love to practice in bots with some of you guys sometime in the future also.\n\nEdit: I forgot to mention, I do have a problem with cancelling auto attacks at the wrong times, which is something I hope to get over soon.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"The Spawn Man","date":"2016-01-05T07:34:59.984+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Not only do you give great advice, but your name means you are now my Riot spirit animal! ;D","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"The Spawn Man","date":"2016-01-05T07:46:10.647+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I myself main support too. The role gives you a fairly good idea of what you'll need to do (or what not to do) if you ever need to shift to ADC. As Spawn says above, last hitting is key. Practice farming a lot. This means farming to push the lane, and farming to freeze the lane (for ganks, or to avoid ganks) too.\n\nYou also need to learn about your role. The role of the ADC is to carry. Going for a kill or helping other lanes is great, but you also need to prioritise. And that often means going to farm the heck out of that pushed lane. I'm not a great ADC, but this knowledge really helps. Farm = win. There was a game I was playing as Jinx, versing another Jinx. She was fairly good, and destroyed me in lane. I think I was 1/3/1, and she was like 5/0/0, and maybe 60 farm ahead of me because she simply shut me out. She got fed and left lane to hunt kills. When she left, I stayed in lane and farmed. When the time came to team fight proper, I had matched her farm, then exceeded it, and then proceeded to help our team get two aces and win.\n\nYou don't have to be good to do well. With a good support (who you should always thank!) you can hold your own with some basic knowledge, and with the right choices, go on to carry.\n\nThat said, LoL is about fun, and if you're like me and actively don't enjoy the ADC role, then don't feel obliged to play it just because you feel it's required. But if you want a challenge, ADC and jungler are two of the most challenging roles to take on.","replies":[{"poster":"Mighty Mortein","date":"2016-01-05T23:29:05.867+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Haha, don't you worry. I'm very thankful for supports who save my butt when I go too aggressive.\n\nI also play jungle a lot and it's the 2nd most comfortable role I play. I usually play Poppy, Kha'zix or even Diana if we lack AP on the team. I find it to be a fun role.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"l am Ares","date":"2016-01-05T05:40:15.362+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"play a custom game with an adc you want to main, and learn to cs in 10 minutes, try aim for 80+ in 10 minutes, then just do what everyone does to become good, watch streams, read build threads and play the damn champion","replies":[]},{"poster":"CHEESYLEEKS","date":"2016-01-05T03:37:17.748+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Don't play for 20 mins with  base ms","replies":[]},{"poster":"SorakaXHealBoT","date":"2016-01-05T07:25:52.227+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Imo the most important thing about playing ADC is learning how to stutter step, orb walk, kiting or attack-move. Learning how to stutter step is extremely important because it helps you with chasing your enemies and helps you deal more damage to enemies running away from you because u can deal a lot more hits before they are outside your maximum attack range. Stutter stepping is basically moving around when u are attacking, moving around when attacking makes it harder for opponents to aim their skill shots and also a lot easier for you to dodge enemy skill shots. A good ADC champion for learning stutter stepping is {{champion:429}} and {{champion:22}}. Kalista is probably the best ADC to learn how to stutter step because if you don't jump around when attacking as Kalista then you should probably stop playing her.  Other tips for playing ADC is to never start/initiate a fight as an ADC except when u are playing {{champion:22}} {{champion:429}} {{champion:15}} who all have an ultimate skill for engaging on enemies. Another tip is try to always stay at your max attack range from your enemies and dodge all skillshots that you can possibly dodge. In teamfights always stay behind your tanks and only start attacking enemies when it is safe to do so. Before a teamfight starts try to stay out of enemy vision as an ADC and only go in after the enemies had used up their CC or engage skills. A last tip from me is that stutter stepping is actually not a mechanic that is limited to ADC/ranged marksmen only because even melee champs can make use of stutter stepping although stutter stepping is only relevant when chasing enemies as a melee champion.

Here is a video guide for learning how to stutter step: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgMMxTofZ5A\n\nOne thing i forgot to mention is that try not to play the role ADC if your ping is higher than 100. IF your ping is around 150 stutter stepping becomes impossibly difficult when you have around 1.8 or 1.9 attack speed because the latency gets in the way. If you have a ping below 100, around 80-90ping stutter stepping should be ok all the way to around 2.2 or mid 2.3 attack speed. Other than that when you are around 2.2 attack speed it is around the attack speed where your hand will have some difficulties to keep up with the stutter stepping which will cause slight decrease in DPS if your hand is slow. You will hopefully get use to it after some practice. New {{champion:96}} is a champion that is impossible to  stutter step with when u have W activated so don't even try to stutter step because you will lose DPS if u stutter step.","replies":[{"poster":"Mighty Mortein","date":"2016-01-05T23:40:21.397+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Luckily, I own all these champions so I can practice with them.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"McRuthless","date":"2016-01-05T18:41:21.682+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"As a support main should be able to lane pretty well as ADC, or at least learn to without too much effort, since you should already have an idea what a good ADC does in lane (Same goes for an ADC main playing support).
