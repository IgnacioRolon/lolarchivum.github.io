My first win got me rank 6, my second got me a Rank 7 token, but my third and last Leona win for whatever reason, got me an A+ and I did a lot better in my last game. I don&#039;t know what goes towards an S game after this patch, but it&#039;s seriously painful to think you&#039;ve done that well and not get an S. Apparently dying as a support is more rewarding than a flawless game. Sure, in my first two wins, I got a couple more assists, but I also KSed and died in them too. I&#039;m open to discuss this too, though I&#039;m a little salty. My apologies.","replies":[{"poster":"Deep Terror Nami","date":"2016-06-29T12:14:00.969+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The A+ game went on longer, so you probably didn't maintain as high of a per minute score. A certain score in 20 minutes isn't worth as much 20 minutes later.","replies":[{"poster":"Mighty Mortein","date":"2016-06-29T12:26:50.678+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Oh, okay. It's just unfortunate, we were pretty far ahead but weren't able to close out the game faster than we did.","replies":[]}]}]}
