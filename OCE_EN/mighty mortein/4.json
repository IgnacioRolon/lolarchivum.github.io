I thought skins were usually released 3-4 days after the patch came out, but it&#039;s almost been a full week. I&#039;m not complaining or anything, I&#039;m just curious. I understand why Fizz&#039;s skin was behind because his skin on the PBE was incomplete, but Kindred&#039;s and Shyvana&#039;s were fine (I believe.) I just hope they&#039;re available soon.","replies":[{"poster":"Talon12","date":"2016-05-23T13:00:21.292+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"they were available for an hour on patch day, but then they went off after that","replies":[]},{"poster":"SkarSkarSkarner","date":"2016-05-23T12:24:22.191+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Seeing as they had Taliyah out last week, they wouldn't have released the skins at the same time due to that. I would say they come out this week.","replies":[]}]}
