Try following the instructions in [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GyJisyEQ248) to stop your firewall from blocking League. If that doesn't work, then I'm going to need you to answer these questions for me if you can:\n\n1. Are you on a wifi/wireless connection, or are you playing with an ethernet/wired connection?\n\n+ What is your ping usually?\n\n+ Could other people be using this connection when you disconnect?\n\n+ What anti-virus do you have if any?","replies":[{"poster":"SpiritFox60","date":"2018-02-02T04:37:10.818+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hello, \n\nI finally figured out the problem.
