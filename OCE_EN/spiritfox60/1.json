Make sure you keep an open mind and try to stay positive.

But that would only benefit me, not the team, so it'd be better to leave Kass open, and ban someone like Zac who is a bigger threat to the whole team.\n\nIf you don't know who to ban, generally the champs with high pick rates are good choices. \nLee Sin\nCaitlin\nYasuo\nLulu\netc.\n\nI personally ban Lee Sin, because a good one is a menace, he is picked very often, and the people who play Lee Sin well, ONLY play Lee, so banning him throws them completely off their game.\n\n___________\n**Picking **\n___________\n\nIt is very important to have something that resembles a balanced team \nThe standard example of a balanced team is:\nDamage (ADC)\nDamage (MID)\nAssistance (Support)\nTank (Top or Jung)\nBruiser (Top or Jung)\n\nDifferent teams will affect the game in different ways.\nA team with 3 damage champs and no tank, will dominate early, and probably mid game. But if the game gets to late, they WILL lose against a team with tanks.\nWhile a team with 2 tanks and and 2 bruisers, will probably lose early game, struggle mid game, and will have the clear advantage in late game.\n\nSo when you are picking your champs, instead of thinking _\"I want to play Teemo.\"_ look at your team. If you have no tanks, you will be of greater help to your team if you pick Shen or Nautilus instead. But if you already have 2 tanks, then Teemo is probably a better pick.\nIf your team is all AD damage, try to pick an AP champ, and vice versa. \n\n______\n\nThe best advice I can give you, is to remember that it is a team game!\nYou can't do everything on your own, and they can't do everything without you.\nIn whatever way you can; picking, banning, building, playing, etc. Try and use yourself to plug the holes left by your team.\n\nIf your Vayne is good, don't steal her glory, use your abilities and items to keep her alive. \nIf your Katarina is terrible, go for the kills yourself, and don't risk yourself to save her.\nIf your Jarvan is building damage instead of tank, adjust your build to make yourself a little tanker.\n\nGood luck if you choose to play!\nBut I would wait a while first.\n\n{{sticker:slayer-jinx-catface}}","replies":[{"poster":"SpiritFox60","date":"2017-06-08T04:40:50.385+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"THANK YOU!

For each lane learn to play at least 3 champions to at least a standard level.\n(Standard being. Know how to farm at least 8cs per minute for lanes, or jungle know how to gank, know how to actually play your role properly and not feed. If you are in the lower ranks Bronze to Gold, make sure you play a champion that does not become useless if behind)\n2. Make sure that one of these champions counter the other so if they get picked you will know how to beat them. For example, if you are a {{champion:75}}  player, and some guy on the other team picked it, and you don't know how to play a champion that counters it. You may be in some trouble if there isn't any nice guys that would help you out. So learn champions that counter your main.\nFor me, I am a master Yi main so whenever someoen picks my Main Champion {{champion:11}}  I know how to counter that by picking someone like {{champion:33}} {{champion:24}} .\n3. Be confident, but not over confident. Make sure you know what you are doing and believe in yourself. But do not be overconfident as tat can ruin you games.\n4. Trust your teammates and don't flame. There will be times when your team seems to be doing very terrible while you are doing fine and you will get angry but don't argue, try to help them out instead of complaining.\n5. The Normal stuff. Make sure you ward carefully, ping when laners are missing EVEN IF YOU ARE DEAD. Because even if you are dead your opponent may not be, they can still go roam.\nPractise how to CS and if you are falling behind make sure to help other lanes since if you stay in your lane chances are you will lose turrets, get tanked and killed more then lose the game. Roam if you are behind since chances are you can help someone else if not yourself.\n\n6. This one can be ignored kindof, make sure you know how to build into a situation.....\nDon't build pure magic resist if you are against a magic later but their AD is fed.... and the stuff.\nBy armour penetration of the enemies are tanky, if you are tank against an enemy of AOE abilities get {{item:3190}} \n\nThese are the general stuff I learnt from playing ranked....\nLast of all. DONT GIVE UP AND FEED. Remember if you make it to late game, it is no longer gold comparison but Skill comparison.\nLate game Is what brings out the better team.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Project Xayah","date":"2017-06-13T15:34:31.963+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I feel like people are missing a very important (though not so obvious) point: Don't play ranked if you're angry or upset!\n\nYou might not think it, but the mindset you take into a game can (and usually, *will*) have a very significant impact on the game itself. Go in with a negative mindset, being angry, frustrated, upset, or just expecting to lose will more than likely cause you to play below your personal average and make more mistakes. It can also be said that you being in a negative mood can also drag your team mates down as well, causing them to play worse as well.\n\nIn the (very few) matches of ranked I've played when I have taken a positive mindset with me I've had outstanding games, regardless of the outcome. The people have been nice, there's been better coordination than I originally expected and even when things got a little negative it didn't drag the mood down too far. This doesn't just apply to ranked, though, it has worked in most/all other modes for me.\n\nThat said, when I first played ranked (as a \"level 30 rush\", mind you) I had 6 quite terrible games. I took a negative mindset with me, was expecting toxicity and losses, and that's all I got. Back then, I was the kind of player to blame team mates and not accept fault where it was due. I've changed a lot since then and have noticed that my games are a lot more positive now than they used to be.\n\nNone of this is to discredit the importance of knowledge, mechanics and the right preparation, though. They're all still very important, but so is your mood when playing. Quite simply; don't play competitively if you're in a bad mood.","replies":[]},{"poster":"xReverie","date":"2017-06-11T08:06:23.452+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Mute the enemy team always. If someone grieves you on your team mute them straight away. Focus on playing the game well and be alert and in the moment for what you're doing now and what you're going to do next. Swallow your pride, assess your mistakes and have a mindset of improvement. You can't win every game, and you will have issues on your team in some games (afks , trolls, inting). Ward, ping what you see on the map, Comms when someone flashes/uses summoner or uses their ult. Be an emotional support for your team / friendly and encouraging rather than flaming or tilting.
