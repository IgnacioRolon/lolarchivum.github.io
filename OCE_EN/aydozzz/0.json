(It's the Gragas skin I wanted to buy.) And then i noticed that all the other Vandal Skins were also not in the store. Brand{{champion:63}}, Twitch{{champion:29}}, Jax{{champion:24}} and Vladimir{{champion:8}}. Even though I don't want the other ones (Well maybe brand) I would like to know. I look at the champion list through the profile and they are there with the Word that everyone hates \"Unavailable\". So I was just wondering now if they are legacy skins now or is there a bug in the system. I really wanted that Gragas Skin. It would be appreciated if I could get some answers.\r\n{{item:3110}}{{item:3110}}{{item:3110}}{{item:3110}}{{item:3110}}{{item:3110}}{{item:3110}}{{item:3110}}{{item:3110}}{{item:3110}}{{item:3110}}{{item:3110}}{{item:3110}}{{item:3110}}{{item:3110}}{{item:3110}}{{item:3110}}{{item:3110}}{{item:3110}}{{item:3110}}{{item:3110}}{{item:3110}}{{item:3110}}{{item:3110}}{{item:3110}}{{item:3110}}{{item:3110}}\r\nThanks\r\nAydozzz","replies":[{"poster":"BarryButcher","date":"2015-01-25T03:33:48.886+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Those skins literally just became Legacy like a month ago.
