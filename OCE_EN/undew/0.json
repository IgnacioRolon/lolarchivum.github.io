Don't give up and don't aim to stream like a pro, what you need to do is win people over with your personalities, don't worry about winning games, just have fun and make sure your viewers have fun. Try not to be toxic until you're famous, as 9/10 people wont buy that crap unless you're pro.\n\nOh, don't ask for donations, just ask people to recommend a friend until you get higher up with viewers, then feel free to do that but for now you want viewers, not money. I mean PewDiePie is famous, so you can be to and his videos are worse than Miley Cyrus and Justin Bieber combined.","replies":[{"poster":"Undew","date":"2014-12-21T09:15:01.674+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yeah, I don't want donations unless I was doing a charity stream but I'm not.
