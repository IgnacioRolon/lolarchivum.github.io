At this current apartment ,Big Air community broadband  is the default ISP.

I've tried to use the   Network Diagnostic tool.

You say that you're at an apartment, so you can't really access the connection yourself. I'd suggest talking to the landlord/equivalent of that and see if you can get it fixed.","replies":[]}]}
