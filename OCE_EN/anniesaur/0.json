I know why I got that but It's not my fault? I was in ranked and playing Annie and suddenly I disconnected and when I reconnected I couldn't move. I got the AFK warning for that and I couldn't even restart the game. I get low priority que for 20 minutes because of that? I couldn't move my champion? I couldn't even press esc? And I get 20 minutes of low priority que just because of that? This low priority system or whatever it is, it's messed up.\r\n\r\nALSO. What's is with some people getting \"Logging onto chat service\" on the bottom of their screens? I really want that fixed please. I had this since the beginning of patch 5.3. I even tried re-installing. That didn't help either. Please do something about it.","replies":[{"poster":"HORSE OF FORCE","date":"2015-03-08T02:58:51.933+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"There have been server issues of recent, causing many people to disconnect in different ways.

To avoid this in the future, stop playing games after you complete a game which you were disconnected from at one point.","replies":[]}]}
