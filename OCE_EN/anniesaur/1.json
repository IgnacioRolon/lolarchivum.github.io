I'm not sure if other people are going through this but I do know that a lot of people from last year had this problem... It says \"Logging on to chat service\" I mean, this was there on the bottom of my screen all day. I thought it was just my internet connection but all the other games are working fine and I  stopped playing league of legends for a day so it can hopefully connect me to chat. I've been looking at a lot of threads but  all the solutions that people came up with (Changing Date&Time and Deleting [summonername].properties.) I really need some help here, I haven't played a game with my friends in a long time since I had to Re-install league since it wasn't opening at all but when I did Re-install, I can open the game but I can't connect to chat. Please help me someone... Someone tell me a solution to fix this. Please don't say \"Re-install league.\"*","replies":[{"poster":"HORSE OF FORCE","date":"2015-02-21T01:52:13.198+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Re-install League.\n\njk\n\nHave you tried resetting your internet options to default, and then setting the security level to medium-low?","replies":[{"poster":"Anniesaur","date":"2015-02-21T04:24:17.426+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=HORSE OF FORCE,realm=OCE,application-id=ElA0rvVL,discussion-id=1GEWEBpQ,comment-id=0000,timestamp=2015-02-21T01:52:13.198+0000)\n>\n> Re-install League.\n> \n> jk\n> \n> Have you tried resetting your internet options to default, and then setting the security level to medium-low?\n\nI have no idea what you're trying to say but I don't think I can.

Try playing League on your own computer, that I can help you with.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]}
