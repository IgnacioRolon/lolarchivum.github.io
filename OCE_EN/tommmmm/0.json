I got in a queue once today and I had trouble connecting to champ select but did and no lag at all in game, but I only got in queue once.....do you think somethings wrong with my client or something like that?\r\n\r\nThanks","replies":[{"poster":"Minx","date":"2016-02-03T15:57:48.037+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hi I have the exact same problem, I'm currently using my Vodafone phone as a tether to play LoL and other games and everything else is running smoothly but for some reason the client refuses to stay connected and i get a PVP.net error every 30 or so seconds, my workaround at the moment is to use my other USB internet to get into a game through the client then switch over to my phone for better ping, however this is not a sustainable solution, I'm hoping its just a minor issue with Vodafone and that it will blow over soon.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Deep Terror Nami","date":"2016-02-02T21:47:19.118+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey littletomplayz,\n\nPlease visit the [Connection Troubleshooting Guide](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues) and perform all the steps listed.
