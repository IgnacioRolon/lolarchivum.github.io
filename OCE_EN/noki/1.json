One of my favorites tbh.\n\nThe aim of the game was to reach 500 without a Rioter interrupting the count. You can&#039;t post consecutively, wait a bit before you post the next number, and you can only post one number at a time. \n\nSince we kind of still have a small community now, we can make it up to 150 and if we surpass that number then we can try to reach 150+ for as long as we can before a Rioter posts and breaks the chain. When a Rioter comments, then we have to start back at 1. I&#039;ll kick it off and we can see how we go. \n\n\n\n1\n\n\nEDIT: So far, 321 is our highest (damn you Maraudar {{item:3073}} )","replies":[]}
