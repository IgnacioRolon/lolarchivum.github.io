As it stands it is harder to get through a 3-game series (3 of 4 games, and the first has to be a win) than a 5-game series (4 of 6 with the first being a win. \r\n\r\nWhile a 5-game series might feel like it has more pressure statistically speaking it is easier to go up to the next tier than advance within a tier which I have always found odd.. I&#039;m not sure what you guys&#039; think of the promo helper, but personally I feel it should be a one off thing, where if you fail the series with help it should reset and you have to lose the series to regain the help again.. \r\n\r\nI don&#039;t think it is a huge deal that this system was introduced I just think getting decayed or demoted should have a heavier penalty than a sizable advantage to any promo you do for that season ever.\r\n\r\nThoughts people?","replies":[{"poster":"Tomblade","date":"2015-11-24T00:26:28.905+0000","up_votes":8,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey Yamaxandau, \n\n> As it stands it is harder to get through a 3-game series (**3 of 4** games, and the first has to be a win) than a 5-game series (**4 of 6** with the first being a win.\n\nWith the promo helper, there are no additional games being added to the series itself - you simply start your series with a free-win.\n\nTo my personal understanding, the promo helper works like this:\n\nScenario A. If you lose a series (eg: O X X), the next time you climb back to 100lp and enter the series, you will begin it with a free-win. IE: you will start your series O - - \n\nEffectively, you only need to win 1 game out of 2 instead of 2 out of 3 (making the win stat required for the promo go from 66% to 50%).\n\nScenario B. If you demote (eg: me going from S2 to S5...rip), then you will get a free-win every promo series you play UNTIL you get back to your season high-point after which you will not get any more promo-win-credits until you fullfil Scenario A.","replies":[{"poster":"Lilja","date":"2015-11-24T05:44:01.256+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yo riot dude.. As of right now on live servers, given you HAVE to win a game to get into the series you have to use that game in part of the series itself if you are referring to the chance of actually winning one. If you are on 99lp you have to win 3 of 4 games, with the first having been a win to pass the series. Because you have to actually win a game to get into the series personally I count it in the difficulty of winning in that series itself because it is an absolute game that you must win to enter the series.\n\nI didn't really explain that well (im bad at context) but that part was talking about my confusion related to LIVE promos sorry.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Talon12","date":"2015-11-24T01:00:37.290+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"means the climb (which i finally will attempt to do, instead of half assedly playing every now and then) to plat will be easier","replies":[]},{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2015-11-24T00:39:39.174+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Huh...that actually clears up a lot.

You get back into the promo a game after and you start with 1/3 wins, meaning you only need to win one game, meaning your chance of winning went up from around 33% to 50%\n\n(old promo needed 66% winrate, now needs 50%)","replies":[]}]}
