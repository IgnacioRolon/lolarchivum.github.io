As the title suggests I think it would be a good idea to refine the champions that you are allowed to play for your given role in solo queue. There seems to be way too many people playing \"off meta\" champs and essentially throwing the game in champ select. Yi mid, Yasuo adc or literally any champ they feel like playing in support because they got autofilled and dont feel like dodging. I understand this wouldn't work in higher ranks, because people that have a solid grasp of the game are able to pick off meta knowledgeably, but people in the lower elo's seem to have seen 1 video where that champ went well in that role, so they think its viable all the time. This is annoying to me whether that player is on my team or on my opponents. I just want to have a somewhat normal game. Players of low elo would still be able to play off meta in norms, and if they get good enough they'd be able to do it in ranked. I may be in the minority in thinking this, in which case it's a bad idea, or perhaps I'm missing something that would make this too hard for riot to implement. It just seems like a good way to force people to play their role or dodge, instead of ruining a game (because they don't care about wasting the other 9 players time) and then getting autofill protection.\r\n\r\nI'm obviously not very knowledgeable when it comes to the game, so there's a good chance this is a horrible idea. I'd love an explanation as to why it's a horrible idea if it is. Thanks.","replies":[{"poster":"Lord Sesshomaru","date":"2019-12-23T09:00:03.772+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"It's not just lower elo that sees 1 video and suddenly everyone plays that champ. _(arguably it happens more in higher elo because you HAVE to find different ways to outplay the enemy because the skill-gap is closer)_\nBut that is often how metas are formed, someone discovers something strong, everyone plays it. After a while Riot either nerfs it into the ground, or buffs literally everything else in the game, and the cycle repeats.\n\nThere was a time when mages and supports laned together, and ADC's went solo.  If players from those times saw the game now, I imagine they'd say the same thing you are.\n\nI understand your frustration completely! I often feel the same.  I'm a player that values control, I like to be able to predict and manipulate the flow of the game, and that becomes difficult when wild cards are added.  But if you don't take risks, you often don't gain anything either.  Which is one of the reasons I don't climb _(that and I'm just shit)_.\n\nBut it comes down to fairness in the end.  Somehow blocking players from picking certain champions in ranked would feel terrible, especially if it was only limited to low elo players who already get the short end of the stick.\nIt would ruin the ability to create team comps around a certain champion combo.  For example, your mid laner picks Yasuo, so you want to go Malphite support, but you can't because 'You haven't played him enough in normals yet'.  That not only feels bad, but potentially holds back the team too.\n\nI think that new champs should be blocked in ranked for the first week, as they are just banned into oblivion anyway, and it's a waste of a tactical ban.\nBut other than that, I don't think there is a fair way of blocking champions off just because players want to try something different. \n\nIn the end, no one really wants to lose.  Yes there are occasional trolls, and sometimes people just lose the plot when they are frustrated, but usually off meta pickers are still trying, they just want to try something new.  _(and god knows, a fair few of them have carried my sorry ass many times!)_","replies":[{"poster":"mic0003","date":"2019-12-23T13:01:12.246+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"This seems fair enough, I guess. Although I definitely wouldn't have a problem with a Malphite support. I'm going off of op.gg, granted Malphite isn't a popular sup, but he still gets played in that position > 19% of the time he is picked, so that seems fine to me. I have more of a problem with the champs that have a ~0% pick rate for that position (once again according to op.gg). \n\nWhenever I see one of these picks on my team or the enemy, I go to that players profile on op.gg and majority of the time they never (or almost never) play that position, which leads me to believe they have been autofilled, and the champion they picked is just the champion that they are maining at the time. This is clearly not strategic, and I would say that these people are refusing to autofill, I wouldn't necessarily call it trolling, but it is refusing to accept a part of the game, which is that you get autofilled sometimes. Of course this may just be an effect of the autofill system, and who am I to complain about that. It's pretty amazing that it takes on average 3 minutes to find a game with 10 real people. I often take a 30 minute dodge timer as to not waste everyones time for 30-40 minutes, but that doesn't mean I can expect others to do the same.\n\nThanks for the response.","replies":[{"poster":"Lord Sesshomaru","date":"2019-12-24T00:17:00.293+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"While I am of the opinion that all players should be able to play all roles relatively decently before even attempting ranked, that isn't always the case.  Often some players do get autofilled and just can't play that role or the champs that go with it.\n\nIn that case, having a 300,000 mastery point lvl 7 Yasuo support, is probably going to work out better than a first time Soraka who has no idea what to do in that position.  At least they are playing a champion they are familiar with.  Agreed It's better to have a proper support, but I'd rather have no support and a Yasuo stealing kills in bot, than a first time support who doesn't know what to do or how their champ works, and feeds all game.\n\nThere is nothing wrong with the autofill system, it is beyond fair.  There are only 5 positions in the game, if people cant put in enough time to at least not feed in all of them, then I highly question wether they should be playing ranked at all.  Even if you don't play those positions, you still have to vs them every game, and you should know your enemy.","replies":[]}]}]}]}
