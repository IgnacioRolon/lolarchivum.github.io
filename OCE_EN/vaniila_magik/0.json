But i would say, Flex is easier.\n\n5 man flexin - You get consistency, voice comms and the ability set up team comps and such. I find Flex is less about winning lanes and more about objective control, wards, teamfights etc\n\nSolo Q is about dealing with chaos. It can be \"easier\" if you play \"solo q\" champions. Champions that thrive in chaos and uncoordinated teams. {{champion:55}} {{champion:92}} {{champion:84}} etc.\nGranted you can get 5 individuals who have similar mindsets and playstyles that gel and can work well. But more often then not, you get a rager, a feeder and a whinger (sometimes 1 person is all 3). So its about dealing with said person AS WELL AS dealing with the game.\n\nThat being said, i prefer the challenge of Solo Que over Flex and will be using Solo/Duo as my \"main\" ranked que.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Ing√©nue","date":"2016-12-04T05:51:17.367+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Personally I find playing flex a lot less toxin (everyone in pre-mades, ranting about teammates in comms rather than in chat). I also prefer playing in a group where I am being encouraged and feel comfortable to try new things (and in turn playing better). \n\nIn general, it depends on your play style. Are you going to be playing by yourself? With a mate? With more than one mate? Do you tilt easily? Do you like communication?\n\nSeason is going to reset in ~3 days. When it happens I would suggest leaving doing your placements for about a month when everything has settled down.","replies":[]}]}
