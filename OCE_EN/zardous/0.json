This is the kind of thinking we need in League. Bruiser ADC and roaming support was the NA meta in Season 1. To be honest I still struggle against Mordekaiser ADC ;)\n\nBut in case you were looking for an actual answer; it's because most of these guys can either be kited, or they fall off in the late game (sometimes both).\n\n+ The problem is most of us low elo players can't really kite at all, and we often get paired with teams who don't understand how to help ADC's kite. \n\n Once you get to higher elos bruisers get really hard to play, because some games you literally can't touch the back line. Just ask anyone Diamond or above what playing against a good {{champion:40}} **Janna** is like.\n\nIf you want to beat bruisers as a squishy, you need to pay attention to your positioning in fights. Also, if you ever get engaged on and find a **Darius** right next to you, don't try and outplay or tank a few hits. You need to immediately flash or use a gap closer (assuming he's used his hook).\n\nI honestly recommend you play tanks and bruisers in low elos though, ADC is a hard role if you don't have good mechanics.","replies":[]},{"poster":"TrashDonnut","date":"2016-03-05T07:33:07.237+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"{{champion:86}} {{champion:122}} have HIGH base damage making them an EARLY GAME CHAMPION.","replies":[]},{"poster":"DragonOfTheVoid","date":"2016-03-05T06:41:28.071+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"lol yep","replies":[]},{"poster":"K1ng Leon1das","date":"2016-03-05T08:24:17.426+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":3,"body":"This game is fucked YES.
