Just thought itd be fun doin it just cuz\n\nNot gonna make any excuses. I've sort of given up on youtube and im only doin it just for fun. I've had my fair share of getting trolled so yeah. Despite the fact that we tried to lose, we actually didn't feed at all (except for the 1st one). I just did what a typical person would do in that elo. My score wasn't even negative and the only reason i put that up is cuz I didn't expect them to surrender because hecarim camped bot and got fed. But either way, once again im sry if I hurt the feelings of ppl in that elo. Just found out my gf cheated on me so I acted stupidly, my bad..","replies":[]},{"poster":"Alamo","date":"2015-06-22T23:23:23.790+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Exhausted,realm=OCE,application-id=hIjvqaz6,discussion-id=ABceEbeU,comment-id=0001,timestamp=2015-06-22T16:04:51.499+0000)\n>\n> Right... your duo'ing with a Gold 2 player...

There's a fine line between feeding on purpose and playing at a bronze level. There's a huge difference between bronze 1 and 5. It's the same between D1 to d5. Just at the bottom instead of the top. So u have ruined those games since you are not a legit player at that Elo. Smurfing in ranked games wrecks the player attraction to lol. Then the game your so god at may not be of much interest anymore. Why, because guys like you wreck it for the lower Elo (which is the major player base) when you already have proven yourself. Why smurf? What does it achieve? Nothing. Except potentially loosing interest to grow the game.  Iv been playing for a long time. Probably much longer then you and I am not good at all, but I'd like to play at my Elo and continue to learn. Not get stomped buy smurfs. As I have friends who don't play now for that reason. \nGlad to be your entertainment noob though.","replies":[{"poster":"XSirCution","date":"2015-07-01T10:57:09.808+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I apologise that I farmed in the jg and not feed the other team?

You took another genuine players spot and 'acted playing as bronze' as you so called it. So i wonder how do you act to play at silver, gold or plat elo? Thats what is so hard to comprehend. Also the fact that you still have your site up stating 'I can't get into bronze'.\nThat should be a  perma ban. IMO.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"ThatsBS","date":"2015-06-24T01:00:58.301+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"So wrong. You should offer to mentor the players who had to play ranked with you... I don't get why some high Elo players would do this, regardless of their RL situation. That would show you regret trolling their rank.","replies":[{"poster":"XSirCution","date":"2015-06-24T10:32:46.149+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Oh no, we actually lost a few cuz they fed a lot. TBH, we both just played at the level that elo would, we didn't feed in any of them. Few games had people with 60 cs in 38 mins ( ADC ). Some had people just getting mad cuz they didn't get their roles, we did not actually jeopardize anyone of their rank. If you look at my match history, I did not feed except for two where every one was just feeding on purpose and raging at each other. We won that 2 games because the people in our team actually deserved the win by playing their best. Point is the people who deserved the win won. It would be unfair for the other team if I had played at a platinum level when i'm in silver elo wouldn't it?","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"RLG Shaky","date":"2015-06-22T14:07:29.020+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"well your not trying hard enough","replies":[]}]}
