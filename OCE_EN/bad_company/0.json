I joust to do it you have any were from 2 to 5 laptops in front of you and if you get a pm.

Also btw lvl 29 might be one level under lvl 30 but the levels dont even matter until it's level 30 so don't say that they're \"high\" level and shouldn't be feeding. The jump from level 29 to 30 is huge unless you get put in bronze V 0 lp.","replies":[]}]}
