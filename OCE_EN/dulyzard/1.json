I find this unfair to the team that has to continue playing with this disadvantage especially when it is around 10-20 minutes into the game. I was wondering if you guys would consider implementing a system where if you lose due to a teammate leaving around mid game (Not at the end of the game) or around 10 minutes before the game ends, you would not lose LP as a result. Just wondering what you guys think of this system, I believe it is a fair way to treat these situations instead of letting players who did not do anything wrong suffer the punishment of a guaranteed loss. Kind regards","replies":[]}
