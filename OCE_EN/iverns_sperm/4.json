However played multiple other games at an elite level (Diablo 3, World of warcraft)\n* Things to be noted: I handle pressure very well and voice my opinions as well as listening to others. I want to improve and to win so I swallow my ego and get on with what needs to be done. Play quite a lot (1000+ ranked games this season) so im dedicated to learning new roles / champions/ styles to suit the team dynamic.\n\nAdd me Ingame (DoctorJekyll) or post down below!\n\nThanks\nJake aka Doctor Jekyll","replies":[]}
