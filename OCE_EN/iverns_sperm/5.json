I&#039;m looking for a mature team that wants to push ranked seriously this season, my goal is to get to plat by seasons end in soloQ. I have been playing league heavily the last 2 odd months after not playing for a long time. My previous gaming history includes being among the top 900 raiding teams on world of warcraft as well as being in multiple top 50 ranks on Diablo 3 leaderboards. I&#039;m looking to transition into playing league fulltime instead of WoW and Diablo so im looking for a solid team base to work with.","replies":[{"poster":"BurningBabies13","date":"2016-01-09T06:07:00.363+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Looking for same, not have much experience on other MMO s but i can support, add me if interested.  \n\nBurningBabies13","replies":[]}]}
