Nobody should be able one shot someone with one ability like assassins don&#039;t even do that. I&#039;m not talking about a spell rotation I&#039;m saying a single ability plus and empowered auto. I assume that is late game 6 item viktor, even so that is 1 ability and an empowered auto dealing potentially 2k+. So he deserves to get a 60% shield off that as well plus a lower cd on his ult? #balanceteam\r\n\r\nI know I&#039;m low elo and &quot;my opinion doesn&#039;t matter&quot; I&#039;ve just been playing this for nearly 8 years and that buff just seems stupid and outrageous to me.","replies":[]}
