Top lane was 0/6 so we tried telling him to play defensive when he starts telling me to \"Kill myself in real life\", the players name was MoostaR on the oce servers. Now I reported him for that, but I doubt that will do anything. What if next time he tells someone to kill themselves and they really take it to heart? A friend of mine who isn't great at LoL sometimes gets stressed out when he does bad and gets flamed for it. What if he was there when this guy was saying \"Kill yourself in real life\", that's disgusting Riot. Maybe give summoners a friendly reminder you don't accept this kind of behavior?
