One way is to allow her clone to be an active ability rather than a reactionary one. Additionally the clones could function similar to Zed&#039;s shadows in that they copy the spell leblanc uses, (if it&#039;s on her ult then it could do damage) otherwise, make her damage randomly pop in 0.75-1.25 seconds (numbers can be tweaked) but her clone does zero damage - this way if the clone lands a spell but the original doesn&#039;t le blanc can deceive enemies into thinking she actually landed the spell etc. Anyway I&#039;m tired so I&#039;ll just leave it at that. Any opinions thoughts are very welcomed :)","replies":[{"poster":"2ceez","date":"2016-08-24T04:29:41.534+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"they should just nerf her damage and swap her q proc damage with a silence \nand put her w on a 0.5 or 1sec cooldown for when she can jump back to it \nand nerf the range of her chain after it connects since it does extend beyond its tooltip range \nand have her ult kept the same \nat least people cant just disappear from your team as you blink before you engage \nand you sit there going wtf wheres my adc or midlaner gone.","replies":[]}]}
