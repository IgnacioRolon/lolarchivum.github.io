I can play ANY role, however I am best at mid and top. My solo rank is plat 4, so I&#039;m looking for teammates who are at least in gold.

Also, I prefer a method of communication such as Teamspeak or Skype.","replies":[{"poster":"SKT T1 Taehoon","date":"2015-04-24T04:12:02.165+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"umm add me my team is all gold and plat im owner but unranked cos of not playing ranked this season but team mems are gold and plat 5s so add me and ill see about adding u in","replies":[]},{"poster":"Ekrah","date":"2015-04-22T14:54:00.179+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Just saying this isn't the best place for ranked teams imo, posts like this don't really get far. \n\n:(","replies":[]}]}
