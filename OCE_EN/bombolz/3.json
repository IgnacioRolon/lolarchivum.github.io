Over 90% of 4v5 games end up in a lost, and there&#039;s literally nothing you or your team can do about it unless the player reconnects. As a player of both League of Legends and Dota 2, I have constantly wondered why League has not yet adopted Dota 2&#039;s system. It&#039;s much more effective in dealing with situations like these. If a  player is not able to connect to a game within the first minute the game is discarded and everyone is sent back into queue. Now I know there are complications for this, but honestly people who have super slow computers - just buy a new one, if you have enough money for skins, it obviously means you probably have enough money for a new $500-600 computer. You are making everyone forced to wait for you to connect. People with toasters should not play ranked, it&#039;s selfish for your team, knowing that your computer might crash and causing the team to play 4v5. If you disconnect in a normal game - that&#039;s fair enough, I mean people would still get angry (probably), but it has much less of an impact.\r\n\r\nNow, on to the second part, if a player on your team disconnects, you should have the right to call for a pause, but here&#039;s where I think things can be a little different from dota 2. Pauses can only be called IF: a player on your team disconnects, and at 50% or more of the remaining players agree to the pause, then the timer will count down from 5 so both teams know when a pause is coming. Furthermore, the enemy team cannot un-pause the game, however pauses only last up to 2 minutes and can only be used 2 times each game. \r\n\r\nFinally, if a player does not reconnect in a game after 10 minutes (and does not ever reconnect afterwards), the remaining players will suffer a reduction in LP loss, maybe about 25% less, and if the team wins a 4v5, the LP gain should be increased by 25% as well (while the dc&#039;d player would still suffer an LP lost).\r\n\r\nThese are speculative numbers - can be altered\r\n\r\nWhat are everyone&#039;s thoughts on this idea?","replies":[{"poster":"Bombolz","date":"2015-11-15T06:37:32.431+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I forgot to consider the new ranked system, however, RIOT can always check for partying up, any member in the party who dcs won't reduce the LP loss of members in the same party. Say if you are duo-queuing and your friend dcs, everyone on your team but you and your friend will get the LP loss reduction.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Ernest","date":"2015-11-13T22:44:28.764+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Have you considered the new ranked system for season 6, because you can queue up with more than 1 person now in ranked and that can lead to exploits with your pause suggestion.\n\nAs for the slow load up, yeah I have a below average loading time (my Mac friend loads faster than me now rip), but when I'm in game unless something happens with the internet there's no problems. I would like to get a computer at least $800 but I currently can't bc 1. I don't need it right now and 2. Can't afford that luxury YET. **Yeah so what I'm saying, slow load ups aren't bad, friend got to D4 on a Mac with long ass waiting times. I guess they're just annoying, but with the new updates people(macs) will start loading faster**\n\nOther than that good suggestions and this wasn't a hate post towards apple or windows","replies":[]}]}
