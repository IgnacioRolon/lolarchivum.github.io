Nice to meet you all, I have just recently created a club that&#039;s open to everyone and is mainly for fun! (so send me a friend request and message if you&#039;re interested in joining). I hope to take an advantage of this new club feature as much as possible, thus I would like to suggest an idea for all clubs. I want to do a club vs club scrim, where members of one club will vs members of other clubs. Any club interested in scrimming against us please let me know - thanks :)\n\nKeep in mind that scrims are for fun, however can also improve on your skills in the process.","replies":[{"poster":"M2001ARYAN","date":"2016-03-22T16:11:41.356+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I would like to join your club but I'm a jungle main who can also go top...
