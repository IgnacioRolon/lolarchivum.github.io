I had a really good Riven game before getting 8/0/3 and everyone convicted me of ksing them when they were ksing me most of the time. The next game was horrible, as I was playing Riven again against higher skill capped players and got like 1/6/13 or something. That crappy game got me bullied so hard. Everyone said how bad I was and that I should give up on League because I suck at it, that the world would be better off without me. I&#039;ve gotten so tired of trolly teams who instalock when you call your role first and they take it. I just want to have a good game of League with nice people. I hate feeder bots as well. Me and a friend less then 10 minutes ago were playing an intermediate Co-op vs AI game to pass time. When we had 2 feeder bots on our team. We ended up losing to them. I don&#039;t even bother reporting either as well because Riot does absolutely almost nothing to try and remove these awful players. And now my friend has also ever since he started been being a douche on League. It&#039;s like a plague. When you go on league you become rude, toxic, salty, tilted, but in the real world you can be nice as ever. My friend as I said before, has fallen down this path. Of course he won&#039;t admit that but he has. He kills someone who accidentally flashes into the wall immediately afterwards &quot;LOL!!!&quot; in all chat comes from him. We were playing a fun custom games with some nice people we found, he played Ezreal and got super fed. Double Yasuo 1v1 in mid lane, one wasn&#039;t doing so good because he was up against an experience level 30 and he was 20. &quot;I think we clearly know who the better Yasuo is here!!&quot; he says in all chat. I even told him over skype how rude that was because he&#039;s just made the other Yasuo feel like crap, and yes that Yas did have a big ego but you have no right to treat someone like that. I don&#039;t know if you guys agree but I&#039;m sick of toxic players.\r\n\r\nVote down below if you think that there should be a server you can join if you&#039;ve got at least 10 honours to filter all the toxic players (If other is selected please state your opinion in the comment section below).","replies":[{"poster":"Icarus1314","date":"2016-03-09T01:07:55.889+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You not reporting the bots is the exact reason why theres still so many of them...

It only creates an environment where those who are prone to negative behaviours are encouraged into them and have no real opportunity or reason to reform and as a result the community becomes worse. \n\nThe best way to deal with this behaviour when you see it is to mute and report in post game. Engaging it will only make it worse. So long as they are reported they will face punishments for their behaviour if it is consistent/frequent (one bad game doesn't count).\n\nPunishment also has 4 tiers, and they are typically administered in order:\n10 game chat restriction\n25 game chat restriction\n14 day account ban\nPermanent account ban","replies":[{"poster":"trolledallmylife","date":"2016-03-08T17:05:54.652+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"News FLASH!\n\nThey will just create another 10 accounts and resume toxic spree!!!!!!!!","replies":[{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2016-03-08T23:45:21.561+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"New accounts are punished much more quickly by the system.

If you build up a big friends list, you can always be playing join a premade 5 and therefore wont have this kind of trouble.

Every single report counts. If everyone is thinking like this (which so many people are), the Riot aren't receiving any info on who to ban. \n\n\n\n> [{quoted}](name=The Death Howl,realm=OCE,application-id=T8eq2lFQ,discussion-id=hg6nQdfG,comment-id=,timestamp=2016-02-20T05:08:56.050+0000)\n>\n>  And now my friend has also ever since he started been being a douche on League.

I love my bf irl but he is super toxic, and when I play with him I can physically feel the fun leeching out of the game. I would rather never play league again than to play with him on a regular basis, so I made some new friends and play with them now. _You can still be friends outside of league. _\n\n\n> [{quoted}](name=The Death Howl,realm=OCE,application-id=T8eq2lFQ,discussion-id=hg6nQdfG,comment-id=,timestamp=2016-02-20T05:08:56.050+0000)\n>\n>  I don&#039;t know if you guys agree but I&#039;m sick of toxic players.\n\nEveryone is sick of toxic players and Riot are providing us with so many tools to make the game more fun and less toxic. We have so many incentives to play in a premade 5 (bonus IP, mastery points, soon hextech crafting) and the ability to report toxic players and they will get punished (as _Seras Dragon_ pointed out).\n\n> [{quoted}](name=The Death Howl,realm=OCE,application-id=T8eq2lFQ,discussion-id=hg6nQdfG,comment-id=,timestamp=2016-02-20T05:08:56.050+0000)\n>\n> Vote down below if you think that there should be a server you can join if you&#039;ve got at least 10 honours to filter all the toxic players (If other is selected please state your opinion in the comment section below).\n\nFirst of all, amassing honours is really easy. Playing bot games will get you at least 1 honour per game (lil cute cinnamon rolls of pureness think everyone is super sweet and helpful). In the past 24 hours alone, I was honoured 16 times just because people recognised my name from chatrooms and the boards. \n\nThis is also kind of a small modification of prisoners island (where all the toxic people are put together in ques have to be nice to get back into genpop).
