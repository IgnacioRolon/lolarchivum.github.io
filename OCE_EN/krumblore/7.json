But wait. This isn&#039;t about champions. I just didn&#039;t know where to put this. I was thinking before that Talon has the worst set of skins. So I came up with an idea. I thought arcade talon. But that&#039;d be weird. But something better. Debonair Talon. I was thinking when he Qs rose petals come off of them instead of blood. His W has different shurikens. His E has a spiral of neon blue lights where he blinked from. And his ultimate is like the W. Idk I thought of it on the spot and I&#039;d like some feedback right now I&#039;m making the splash art to see how he looks","replies":[{"poster":"Hyde","date":"2016-02-20T23:30:50.919+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I think that's an awesome idea! I was playing talon a while ago and wanted to buy a skin for him, but like you said his skins aren't that great.. but this one sound way better! Would love to see the art for it.","replies":[]}]}
