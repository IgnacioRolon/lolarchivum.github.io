You don't get to make a \"cheap\" champion.\n\nA passive that lets you kill yourself... not good.\n\nQ is kinda of meh... does nothing but give a shield? I don't think there is an ability like that in the game at all.\nMorg shield is MR and makes you spell immune, Janna shiled gives bonus AD, Sion shield explodes for damage. Needs to do more than just shield.\n\nW is kinda cool. A reverse blitz hook. (kind of like Nautilus hook but a little different).\n\nE sounds like Shaco. I think you could make it cool, by making it stick in their chest/mark them. Then if he uses his W on them its \"pulls the knife out\" doing bonus damage.\n\nR. Its his E and W combined. Like i said you can just add the interaction i came up with earlier and give him a better ult.","replies":[{"poster":"Krumblore","date":"2015-11-24T12:05:51.324+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thanks for the help I'll be sure to edit some changes","replies":[]}]}]}
