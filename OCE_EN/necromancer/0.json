I never really have unless I wanted to get that next rank or wanted someone on the enemy team to lose. Like, if an enemy player was in their promos and needed a win, I would try as hard as I could to make them lose. Same with my teammates. Bad players do not deserve to win games.","replies":[{"poster":"surferfijio","date":"2017-04-14T12:34:30.764+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"you  sound like a toxic troll/bad player yourself man. not a good thing to do to your own teammates.","replies":[{"poster":"Necromancer","date":"2017-04-15T03:44:48.740+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=surferfijio,realm=OCE,application-id=Ntey9fRZ,discussion-id=oZbQAwIf,comment-id=000000000000,timestamp=2017-04-14T12:34:30.764+0000)\n>\n> you  sound like a toxic troll/bad player yourself man. not a good thing to do to your own teammates.\n\nThe title of this thread indicates so.","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"CHEESYLEEKS","date":"2017-04-14T10:50:43.659+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"http://i3.kym-cdn.com/entries/icons/facebook/000/004/188/toilet_paper_dilemma.jpg\n\nA or B ?","replies":[{"poster":"Necromancer","date":"2017-04-15T03:44:21.723+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=CHEESYLEEKS,realm=OCE,application-id=Ntey9fRZ,discussion-id=oZbQAwIf,comment-id=0001,timestamp=2017-04-14T10:50:43.659+0000)\n>\n> http://i3.kym-cdn.com/entries/icons/facebook/000/004/188/toilet_paper_dilemma.jpg\n> \n> A or B ?\n\nB unless you have a cat or a toddler.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Wuks","date":"2017-04-14T16:15:36.215+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Always over, never under. \n\nhttps://www.cnet.com/news/over-or-under-the-science-of-toilet-paper-orientation/\n\nScience.","replies":[{"poster":"CHEESYLEEKS","date":"2017-04-15T01:09:23.089+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"https://imgflip.com/s/meme/Matrix-Morpheus.jpg\n\nwhat if i told you i dont wipe","replies":[]},{"poster":"Talon12","date":"2017-04-15T00:48:57.739+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Goes over as long as you don't leave it hanging too long, no one wants it wiping against the floor and wall, thats just grotty.","replies":[]}]}]}]}
