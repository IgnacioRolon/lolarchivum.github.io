I&#039;ve been trying and trying to fix my attitude, but I just can&#039;t. I don&#039;t want my account banned and don&#039;t want to lose my stuff on there. I would really like to be chat restricted permanently. I am genuine with this post and would love a Riot staff to contact me (if they read boards).\n\nI have also found that people who are chat restricted are a lot more exciting and polite to play with. It would make League of Legends a much more enjoyable experience for myself and others.","replies":[{"poster":"Akkordian Zoeve","date":"2017-08-07T12:00:06.769+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You can make the chat box *very* small, and then actually move it **off the screen**. It's basically a chat restriction without the tarnish to your summoner standings. Plus you won't see all the tilting text that makes you toxic in the first place.","replies":[]},{"poster":"PurpIe","date":"2017-08-07T09:48:18.218+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Weow! \n\nThat's actually pretty noble of you to get chat restricted for the sake of your team and the overall game atmosphere. \nI would see how it would be an issue though. \n\nLike, the whole point of a punishment is for you to learn and improve/reform.\nDoesn't being chat banned mean you can't talk to your 'friends' on your friend's list? Or does a chat ban only apply to ingame chat function?","replies":[]}]}
