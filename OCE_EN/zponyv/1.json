When I left click the mini-map and try drag my camera view, it won&#039;t allow it. It only happens on one of my league accounts, but the other it seems to work fine. Their used to be an option allowing for clicking on mini-map but now I can&#039;t see it in the client. \r\n\r\nI&#039;ve tried several things including deleting the config, resetting everything to defaults, restarting PC, restarting league, repairing league etc. I&#039;m really unsure why it happens only on one account and not the other, any help would be greatly appreciated!","replies":[{"poster":"SephirothSG","date":"2016-11-19T10:25:45.470+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey there,\n\nSounds like you're not resetting your configuration correctly, please follow the steps outlined below.\n\n* Login to the client (which syncs your settings with the server)\n* Go to C:\\Riot Games\\League of Legends\\Config\n* Delete the \"Persisted.json\", \"game.cfg\" &\"input.ini\" files\n* Launch a custom game\n* Exit the custom game\n* Exit the client\n\nLet me know if that helps.","replies":[{"poster":"zPONYv","date":"2017-08-07T09:33:58.452+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=SephirothSG,realm=OCE,application-id=ElA0rvVL,discussion-id=u6lI9qA3,comment-id=0000,timestamp=2016-11-19T10:25:45.470+0000)\n>\n> Hey there,\n> \n> Sounds like you&#x27;re not resetting your configuration correctly, please follow the steps outlined below.\n> \n> * Login to the client (which syncs your settings with the server)\n> * Go to C:\\Riot Games\\League of Legends\\Config\n> * Delete the &quot;Persisted.json&quot;, &quot;game.cfg&quot; &amp;&quot;input.ini&quot; files\n> * Launch a custom game\n> * Exit the custom game\n> * Exit the client\n> \n> Let me know if that helps.\n\nYeah, that worked.
