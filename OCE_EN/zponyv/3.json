All players should preferably be 18+ but if you are mature we can see how you fit in with the team.\n\nI myself will be managing/coaching both teams and eventually will be looking for a second analyst to help along side me and do work reviewing games and organizing team comps. We are looking for people who are frequently available, have the right attitude and deal well with criticism and will take it on board as a way of learning and developing as a player. We are trying to find at least one more Diamond player and if possible two and another person that may be Platinum or above.\n\nAll players will be trialed for at least two games to see how their basic mechanics are and if they will be a benefit to the team.\n\nI am looking for this to be an active team playing at a minimum 3 days per week. Also we will be using Team-speak for our voice coms, I plan to try another program out to compare in a couple of weeks time, but for now it will be Team-speak.\n\nCould you please fill out this form if you would like to trial or add me in game and send me the completed form. You may also add me in game with the form completed.\n\nName:\nIRL first name:\nAge:\nState:\nTop two roles:\nTop 4 champions in each of those roles:\nRank:\nAvailability:\n\nGood luck and will be looking forward to hearing from you soon.\n~zPONYv~","replies":[{"poster":"IreIia Carries U","date":"2015-10-13T17:44:59.076+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Name: Satria\nIRL first name: Isaac\nAge:18\nState: ACT\nTop two roles: Top/Mid/Jg (sorry couldn't decided which 2 stood out more)\nTop 4 champions in each of those roles: Top (Riven, Yas, Mao, Malp) Mid (Syndra, Xerath, Yasuo, Zed) Jungle (Tahm Kench, Kha'Zix, Amumu, Shaco)\nRank: Diamond 5\nAvailability: 24/7 (don't go to school atm as i've dedicated my life to league)","replies":[]},{"poster":"Janitor Dreams","date":"2015-10-13T11:12:03.985+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I know you said your not looking for an analyst yet, however i would like to apply.
