I mainly play support particularly thresh or jungle and particularly Vi. I am pretty decent with communications and understand rotations and ways of bringing back the game if the other people in my team maintain a positive mindset. My mechanics are semi - decent but I do think I do very well on Vi and Thresh. \r\n\r\nIf anyone is looking for a sup main for a ranked 5's team particularly Gold or above just send me a friend request in game or reply on here.\r\n\r\nThanks\r\nzPONYv","replies":[{"poster":"General Nesh","date":"2015-03-23T22:17:10.002+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey Man, We currently have an opening for a Jungler/Support in our ranked team ;) Add me.
