All players should preferably 18+ but if you are mature we can let u in.\nI myself will be managing/coaching  as I want to play as little as possible because I no longer enjoy playing, but still enjoy the game, as we start out I will be filling roles necessary and when all roles are filled I'll be moving to managing/coaching.\n\n I am looking for this to be an active team playing at a minimum 3 days per week. Also we will be using Team-speak for our voice coms, I plan to try another program out to compare in a couple of weeks time, but for now it will be Team-speak.\n\nCould you please fill out this form if you would like to trial or add me in game and send me the completed form.\n\nName:\nIRL first name:\nAge:\nState:\nTop two roles:\nTop 4 champions in each of those roles:\nRank:\nAvailability:\n\nGood luck and will be looking forward to hearing from you soon.\n~zPONYv~","replies":[{"poster":"catch this work","date":"2015-09-22T10:13:30.120+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Name: Almost Mozart\nIRL first name: Ben\nAge: 17\nState: NSW\nTop two roles: Jungle Mid\nTop 4 champions in each role: Rengar, Shyvana, Katarina, Orianna\nRank: Plat II (atm)\nAvailability: when ever is needed","replies":[{"poster":"zPONYv","date":"2015-09-24T09:11:26.485+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"ur friends list is full","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"TheLostBB","date":"2015-09-23T02:28:20.349+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Name:TheLostBB\nIRL first name: sam\nAge: 20\nState: vic\nTop two roles: support/mid\nTop 4 champions in each of those roles: thresh morgana braum blitz / karthus zed ahri talon\nRank: plat 2 ( diamond last season)\nAvailability: whenever","replies":[{"poster":"zPONYv","date":"2015-09-24T09:10:57.068+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"ur friends list is full","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"yrtqfgwe27rtfyiq","date":"2015-09-20T11:18:55.603+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Name: Cuddle Bear\nIRL first name: Jake\nAge: 17\nState: NSW\nTop two roles: Support Jungle\nTop 4 champions in each of those roles:Shaco Lee Blitz Nami\nRank: Plat V\nAvailability:when ever i can","replies":[]},{"poster":"Caeli Pluvia","date":"2015-09-19T06:31:25.449+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"***","replies":[{"poster":"zPONYv","date":"2015-09-20T05:07:02.119+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"This is a troll right?","replies":[{"poster":"Caeli Pluvia","date":"2015-09-20T07:47:54.820+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"***","replies":[{"poster":"zPONYv","date":"2015-09-20T09:23:59.556+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hm time do u spend posting shit on forums haha, looked at ur profile and u actually spend ur days trolling on the oce forums haha..
