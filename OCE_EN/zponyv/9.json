I am grateful that Riot increased the server times to 24 hours on the weekends which has been bliss, but now that more people may be moving over from NA, would it be possible to have the servers run 24/7. \r\n\r\nI myself always have mixed sleep patterns so am usually awake most of the time&#039;s when the queue&#039;s are down and not so much when they are up. Also have they already spoken about this somewhere? I assume they have. It would be so terrific though to queue and feel like shooting myself in the head 24/7. I&#039;m on that plat grind and wanna get it done asap.","replies":[]}
