My question is why have you not uploaded an official version of the login screens and music from before Hecarim. I understand some of the music is similar if not the same as some of the newer ones such as 2011 and 2012 Lunar Revel music being the same and the 2011 and 2013 Snowdown Showdown musics being the same, however there are some unique music tracks such as the Lulu login screen and the Surprise Party Fiddlesticks login screen, as well as the original music which is surely worth bringing back for nostalgia&#039;s sake. Even in the instances where the music is the same, personally I would like to see them as well as they still have a unique art and animation. \r\nIs there any reason these login screens previous to Hecarim have not been officially uploaded? I may be alone in this regard but I listen to your playlist for hours on end while travelling and as casual listening and it does annoy me that I have to create a separate playlist using unofficial uploads to listen to the older tracks.","replies":[]}
