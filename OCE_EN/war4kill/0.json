How's that possible? Your client should be able to reconnect if there's a connection available.\n\n>I know, tribunal will eventually catch up\n\n>tribunal will eventually\n\n>tribunal\n\n{{item:3070}} If only we had a tribunal. {{item:3070}}\n\nThe way I know Leavebuster to work is that it adds a leaver mark to your account when you do not input anything to the game server for around five minutes. If you get a leave-marker on your account when you already have a marker, you get considered for a punishment, which is based off of your previous actions and if you have been punished previously. Usually, the more punishments you've had in the past, the more severe this coming punishment will be. It *is* possible to be banned this way, but it won't come from the non-existent tribunal, but your account reaching a threshold and a red reviewing your case (if they don't have anything else to do).\n\nIf your internet is constantly cutting out, then it's expected of you to fix it before playing more match-made games. You can either troubleshoot your current connection or, as you seem to be doing, get a new one (unless the problem is rooted to your computer, in which case you'd have to troubleshoot if you want to keep playing).\n\nIf you're having trouble with your new connection, don't hesitate to come back here and ask for help. You're more than welcome.\n\nBest of luck.","replies":[]}]}
