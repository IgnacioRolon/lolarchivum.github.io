But as it turns out she got one of the most frustrating of her bugs fixed! I feel that Polymorph is a huge spell that I can use to completely remove an enemy&#039;s damage for a little bit (which is so helpful against bursty champs). But it always sucked when I used it on Kalista and I would still see my ally melt away (although see a little seal hop like that was pretty ok). So THANK YOU for fixing Kalista&#039;s magical immunity to being a squirrel.","replies":[{"poster":"lordofrage","date":"2016-01-14T06:42:54.774+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"nice man  im planning on getting her next","replies":[]}]}
