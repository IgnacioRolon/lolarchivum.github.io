And it runs game such as dying light (high demand games) pretty smoothly. Unless you want to be playing nothing but flash games i don't think a $400 will cut it for most games.","replies":[{"poster":"Uncle kracker","date":"2016-02-14T01:54:33.032+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"the lappy only needs to play league, no other games aha.

Even got itself a Nvidia graphics card (which it doesn't even need to run league, but just improves the overall quality of the game if chosen to be used)\n\nIf you ask me, this is going to be one of the best deals you may see in a while for a cheap laptop that can run league (among other things) to a great standard.\n\nThough you can get better if you invest to around $700-$1000","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Uncle kracker","date":"2016-02-14T02:10:16.241+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"http://www.gumtree.com.au/s-ad/tuncurry/laptops/acer-aspire-v3-571g/1099230675\n\nthis is 300 on gumtree is it any good?","replies":[{"poster":"BarryButcher","date":"2016-02-14T10:14:02.365+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"heaps good for the price.
