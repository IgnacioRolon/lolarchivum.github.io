Take the newly reworked Graves for example. I rarely see a graves lose lane due to his high burst, mobility and aoe damage. His recent win rate is pathetic, with 56% over 1250 games. And the juggernaut release in general was an absolute flop. Tank and high, true damage riot? With all the releasing of new, &#039;op&#039; champions, why are we suddenly deciding to nerf Riven? I acknowledge that she is strong but she fits in nicely with all the newly reworked champions, because they&#039;re all strong, too. Also, why does Riot believe that adding &#039;minigames&#039; to champions (Skarners pillars, Bard&#039;s chimes, Kindred&#039;s stacks etc.) is helping in any way to balance a champion. I feel that they are excessive. It feels like this game is turning into DOTA, where all the champs are stupidly op, therefore balanced. But the transition is odd, Riot is buffing champions one by one, ruining the game until the transition is over. They talk of &#039;strategic diversity&#039;, but I don&#039;t feel that this is so, they still have recommended items, which I normally build every game, regardless of the situation. Maybe that&#039;s just a bad habit, I don&#039;t know. I&#039;ve never felt like we need more bans for ranked, but with the uprising of all these reworked champions, I don&#039;t want any of them intruding in games of which I actually want to win.\r\n\r\nThat&#039;s just a rant of mine, needed to let off some steam. Hopefully you agree, and hopefully Riot will realize the mistakes of which they&#039;ve made.\r\nSee you on the Rift..\r\nNOT","replies":[{"poster":"Project Xayah","date":"2015-11-13T00:24:23.547+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Honestly, I wouldn't be surprised if Riot started losing money because of the direction the game is headed in, and if (and when) that happens OCE will be the first to go.","replies":[{"poster":"The Mighty Smurf","date":"2015-11-13T02:20:43.598+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=HeartVine,realm=OCE,application-id=FjGAIbRv,discussion-id=V7VkEIlu,comment-id=0000,timestamp=2015-11-13T00:24:23.547+0000)\n>\n> Honestly, I wouldn't be surprised if Riot started losing money because of the direction the game is headed in, and if (and when) that happens OCE will be the first to go.\n\nThis and yeah the experience of this game now is just terrible.

I'm just pointing out a mere coincidence in the timing of the sales and gameplay changes with respect to your previous comment.\n\nand anyway nothing is ever perfect and will always need refining, that's why there are patches. do you honestly think because a company starts losing money that they'll just go and call it quits. it's true \"Having a plan doesn't guarantee success.\" but there are always ways to bounce back. there are millions of active players worldwide, do you honestly think that after a couple of failed attempts that losing money is really the issue? the game has a loyal fan base that continues to play despite bits here and there that they may not like.\n\nevery patch always has changes that some people may not like but eventually people see the positive and if they dont, Riot themselves are made of gamers, and understand different viewpoints and make adjustments. and plus this is just preseason with plenty of room for changes.\n\ntbh you're just full of pessimistic hypothetical situations aren't u\nlmao downvote me all u want","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"McRuthless","date":"2015-11-14T04:42:46.493+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Every year there's comments like yours, and yet every year the game gets bigger, so obviously they're doing something right.","replies":[]},{"poster":"trolledallmylife","date":"2015-11-13T17:28:23.673+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Riot never gives a flying FFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFF\n\nName 1 change riot implemented which was from community feedback?\n\n?\n\nyup NOTHING!","replies":[{"poster":"TeCoolMage","date":"2015-11-14T06:22:44.437+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=trolledallmylife,realm=OCE,application-id=FjGAIbRv,discussion-id=V7VkEIlu,comment-id=0009,timestamp=2015-11-13T17:28:23.673+0000)\n>\n> Riot never gives a flying FFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFF\n> \n> Name 1 change riot implemented which was from community feedback?\n> \n> ?\n> \n> yup NOTHING!\n\nThis is some of the stuff they implemented (or plan to implement) that I requested somewhere between a few days to two months before\n\n- Chat logs in blind pick are ordered the same for everyone (but sometimes the first few messages don't appear)\n- Kindred's passive's cap is increased based on stacks, so counter jungling and taking objectives is still a huge part of his identity (but it's not very much, and he still revolves around using ultis in teamfights)\n- Reworked client UI instead of focusing more on in game UI (but it's a bit late)\n- Let full ability (not TF, who AAs) champs be able to jungle (They're working on it, it's pretty good right now, with the new Talisman)\n\nThat's all I can remember. I don't know if it's a coincidence or something, but they do _try_ it when I ask sometimes so I'm happy with Riot.\n\nI haven't even spent any Riot points on the game, the only RP I got is from a friend who pitied me and donated 520 when I said I don't use money on LoL, and the free 400. I haven't even used it yet either.\n\n\nThey do make questionable decisions, but it's still better than DoTA 2 (at no point did they say sorry for Diretide, the closest their community got from Volvo is \"We miscalculated how much the community likes Diretide\", while Riot tends to criticise themselves with things like \"spaghetti code\"), so LoL continues to be my choice in MoBAs.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Saturok","date":"2015-11-13T03:39:21.529+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Lol how long has it been since the patch release again?

Rationale for this is how can a team of developers with less funding etc rival with riots abundance of resources that they can throw at any issue. I think that LoL will dominate the MOBA market for several more years to come just like how Blizzard has managed to monopolise mmorpg's so successfully with WoW. I think the issue is not in Riot not making money but potentially that there being no growth factor. Personally I think they should cut into the market of other gaming genres turn this into a big label like Blizzard has done by creating other games. However... I do find it a little stagnant and lacking in the fact that the one real draw that DOTA 2 has over LoL and the only real advantage it has over Riot in terms of how they think is that they let other people do the thinking for them. Create a virtual game designer like Warcraft III had that enables triggers etc to form so people can make tower defences, etc... And maybe a new genre will form and then you can pounce on that and make it another part of Riot's claim to fame by revamping it visually and conceptually in the long term. Generating new champions and redirecting peoples attention to buying those new champions can only generate so much money.\n\nTo briefly reiterate I think the game needs a custom game making tool then millions of people will convert back from DOTA 2 to LoL.","replies":[]},{"poster":"HTMekkatorque","date":"2015-11-13T06:54:09.529+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I couldn't disagree with half the comments more... The new masteries are actually really really good, maybe a little more confusing at times but if you actually spend like 45 minutes to watch phreaks analysis of them or actually read a few guides on the masteries changes you'll actually see that the games just becoming more customisable. Then you talk about Riven nerfs as being a bad thing but nerfs in one elo don't make sense to some players because certain champions are stronger in their respective elos for example rivens in low elo kinda suck all the time but then you watch pro teams on riven and fiora and irelia all these champions that make no sense in low elo... And balancing is hard there are over 120 champions when you think how many variables change the outcome of each fight and knowing that sure a jinx/graves/vayne might kill you in one less auto or something, I consider that very decently balanced and that discovering which champions are powerful at a respective time is part of playing into the strategy of the game.\n\nP.s. awesome work riot. love all the s6 changes.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Tele","date":"2015-11-13T06:02:15.030+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Let's not forget guys it's preseason ATM.
