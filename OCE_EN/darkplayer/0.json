The MMR is completely different from ranked and you will often find challenger players playing with and against bronzes. As a low level you will also often find that people in your games will be partied up with their friends of varying ranks. \n\nNormals are also where people go to play around and learn new things, meaning they won't necessarily be good at what they are playing.","replies":[]},{"poster":"uNhoLeee","date":"2019-05-13T15:49:38.647+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"unsure, oce is just so unskilled.","replies":[]},{"poster":"The Loose Gunner","date":"2018-03-12T18:56:22.951+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"i have that team in ranked and im legit stuck in bronze elo... whats wrong with your match making system i feel that its broken, i find more unskilled players then players that want to leave bronze, i dont care if they new, if they play ranked it got to be more serious then im just gonna play ranked for fun cause its harder then normal... like i played with so many people who are bad and there is people that are good but they always in the enemy team.. can the matching making system get fixed? if not i might aswell quit league in general because im not interested in carrying noobs out of bronze if they so heavy to take along.","replies":[]}]}
