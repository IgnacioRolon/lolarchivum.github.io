And because of that, it makes people rage. Just imagine you're low on HP so you decide to recall. Then you step on a 'shroom and die. The blinding dart gets annoying and the poison can kill you or whittle down your HP for an easy kill. Don't forget he can become stealth' due to Camouflage. {{summoner:3}}","replies":[]},{"poster":"DarkGate","date":"2015-11-28T12:47:04.148+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"it seems like a fun idea in theory... But as we all know when people are behind a computer screen, they tend to be more. open with their opinions,\n\nwhile the skin would be a cute play on how annoying teemo is. but the Religious iconography would not only attract attention from Religious players but also various media outlets who are looking for another outrage to complain about how \"video games are corrupting our youth\" \n\nwhile the idea is cute i doubt that riot would place themselves upon the firing line like that. ~~although the free PR could be tempting ~~ i hope riot doesn't cause a social uproar. even though it would be fun to watch.","replies":[{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2015-11-28T13:43:41.872+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"There is also the fact that they try to keep everything as region open as possible. Take Karthus as an example, all his chinese artwork was different, and I think his models may have been tweaked as well, because they can't use skulls. so when he was reworked he was made ghost-y instead of skeletal. \n\nGraves's cigar is another example. The reason Gragas Esq hasn't lost his yet is because as a skin they can just disable it for tournaments until such a time they actually go VU Gragas at which time he will probably lose it.\n\nOfc for a Satan Teemo skin they COULD just disable it for tournaments, but those who would take offence to such a thing exist in pretty much every region. That said, they could make something like a demon skin and just keep the religious aspects out, but that would likely infringe on Omega Squad somewhat as it is essentially what Teemo would be like if he didn't have the cute and fluffy routine masking his insanity.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"BRUSHED","date":"2015-11-28T08:44:54.141+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"atleast with a satan skin or something like it they could finally stop giving him skins.\ndont get me wrong new skins are nice but teemo has like 12 skins atm... thats more than anyone else. and the trouble is they keep making them too cute and fun loving for most teemo players to like. the only one that isnt along those lines and almost scratches the itch is omega squad. thats about as dark as we will probably get for him though :(","replies":[]},{"poster":"BRUSHED","date":"2015-11-28T08:44:39.966+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"aww shit why not make it christamas themed AND MAKE A KRAMPUS TEEMO SKIN","replies":[]},{"poster":"Combilizer","date":"2015-11-28T08:41:46.900+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"They could make a satan skin for him, hehe.","replies":[]}]}
