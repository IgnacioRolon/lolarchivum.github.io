A Rework with a more enjoyable experience for both sides of the team.\r\n\r\nAs of at this moment Teemo is currently sporting:-\r\na passive that lets you go invis by not moving and gives a attack speed buff\r\na Q that is click and send missile to target and blind them (modified auto attack)\r\na W that is a passive out of combat movement speed buff and an active speed boost\r\na E that is a damage over time on auto attacks\r\nand a R that is place trap on ground this trap slows and does damage over time\r\n\r\nwhen playing against a Teemo the play style always revolves around getting in range, if you are in his range he should auto attack and use his q to reset his auto attack. or wait and strike when an enemy walks on a shroom. The best way to counter this is by tanking his q and then positioning yourself in a place that will stop him from escaping. once the q ends attack and kill him.\r\nthe issue with this is that it relies on him using his q and you taking the damage from it. this is unavoidable damage which is a terrible game mechanic to have as it makes playing against him feel pointless and annoying with no real counter play. this also is applicable to his mushrooms, though vision items are abundant with control wards, and dusk blade with its new passive. ap and tanky counter parts don&#039;t exist which means mages and tanks generally odnt have a reliable way of avoiding mushroom damage. again unfun.\r\n\r\nSo I propose a few changes:\r\nfirst off lets change his Q from a point click too a skill shot similar to jinx&#039;s and jihns snipe ability\r\nchanging the spell type means it isn&#039;t a guaranteed hit, it loses its auto attack reset, it no longer can go through minions and it is avoidable which makes sense since I&#039;m sure Teemo cannot be 100% accurate all the time.\r\nthis opens up the possibility for more damage and range or even a longer blind.\r\n\r\nnext his R, lets shrink the hit radius of these mines to something similar of Caitlyn&#039;s traps and make it so that they can be seen if they are 1 Teemo way.\r\nwhat this does is it makes it so the traps are no longer luck based on weather or not you walk on them and rather wether or not you are paying attention. \r\nwhat this does is it means they are technically weaker, which opens them up for a couple of buffs such as:\r\nmore mushrooms\r\nfaster collection time\r\nmore damage\r\ngreater slows\r\nlower mana costs\r\nand the list goes on.\r\n\r\n\r\nfinally I&#039;d like to put forward the idea of switching his E and his passive around.\r\nmaking it so that he has the option to activate his E and instantly stealth but whilst its on cooldown he cannot automatically stealth by not moving. leveling this up would lower cooldown and raise passive attack speed gained from breaking stealth\r\nhis new passive would scale with him as he levels up towards 18.\r\n\r\nThank you for giving this a read id love to hear what you guys think and any other ideas you guys have. :D","replies":[{"poster":"Roguestoney","date":"2016-12-24T12:24:29.433+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Teemo is fun for me to vs tbh i stomp the rat.","replies":[]},{"poster":"LUPIN lll","date":"2016-12-25T10:41:35.255+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You ever fought a Vayne?","replies":[]},{"poster":"Fitzky","date":"2016-12-25T09:34:50.207+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Just go {{champion:122}} play passively until level 6 then just all in him and he's dead","replies":[]},{"poster":"FerrousOxide","date":"2016-12-23T14:51:00.277+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I find him an infuriating opponent.

Like making it work like wuju style, where the passive movespeed bonus is only active when the ability is on cooldown, otherwise it just won't feel so interactive.

Sure his Q could be blinded and that sucks, but W and the stacks kinda back up for it. Just farm under tower and then wait til blind finishes before smashing down that Q during trades while W prevents Teemo from running away. Running Ghost as the summoner also helps catching up during trades. And once you're fed enough stacks, it's GG for him when he sees you. But idk about this so don't quote me on this one.","replies":[{"poster":"BRUSHED","date":"2016-12-24T12:29:02.753+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"a Teemo and Nasus match up is based on the Teemos skill for knowing when to blind. and nasus's skill for knowing when to hold his q.\nthough nasus does have a huge advantage with his ultimate and wither. slowing teemo and negating damage is a huge thing against teemo.\nAgain its down to the players skill match ups.\n\na perfect counter to teemo is jihn. teemo's blind is not long enough to stop jihns attacks as jihn has such a long wind up and does insane amounts of auto attack damage. with his range it is almost impossible for teemo too get a blind off before jihn attacks ie jihn will start his auto before teemo can get in range of using his q, teemo will fire his q half a second after jihn fires his auto. jihns auto will hit teemo, teemos q will hit jihn, jihn will go for another auto blind is half over at this point, by the time the auto hits teemo the blind is up. making teemos q completely pointless for trading against jihn aside from being an aa reset.","replies":[{"poster":"Nightjar","date":"2016-12-24T17:56:06.853+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"that said a good teemo will use the fact that he can build pretty much anything and I do remember games as teemo where I used to build things like rylias+liandries, or BoRK or Mercurial which would all bone a nasus pretty hard. Nasus can outscale teemo, but I can't imagine how a nasus could beat an equally skilled teemo in the earlygame without help and pressure from the jungler. \n\nThinking through this more, if the nasus wants to sacrfice some cdr, an early banshee's might make the blind more managable since teemo only has 2 abilities that can pop a spellshield and when running around it helps mitigate shroom damage.","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Nightjar","date":"2016-12-23T17:00:07.903+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You obviously don't understand what teemo means. Teemo is designed to be a counterpick lanebully type champion, he's designed to be infuriating in lane with his q blind and his e poison damage which makes him an exceptionally strong early game lane bully.\n\nTeemo lacks hard cc, he relies on the island of toplane during the early game and he's not good at skirmishes and being part of a team comp during teamfights. He uses trademark simple mechanics and encourages a strong focus on macroplay and map control. Teemo is very snowbally and relies heavily on establishing map control so that he can create splitpressure and use his mushrooms to establish strong vision control.\n\nHe's fun to play and a very easy way to win most early game lane matchups, but unless you have very strong understanding of how to play the map and control the pace of the game you'll fall off very hard. Teemo lacks hard cc, tankiness, defensive peel, comparable burst to other squishy mages, nor the sustain dps and range of an adc. Teemo is a lanebully who transitions into an assassin and a unique source of vision control that allows your team to have a much greater amount of information on the movements of the enemy team.\n\nTeemo is designed to be infuriating and he's not designed to be like other champions. He very much fits his lore and he punishes players who rely more on mechanics than game knowledge, since teemo relies heavily on game knowledge and is also countered as such.\n\nHis shrooms are countered by red sweeper, control wards and duskblade; though I do feel more counter trap items would be more intuitive just like the lightbringer or arcane sweeper. Also his shrooms landing is not luck, teemo can only place so many shrooms and so a good teemo must understand autopathing and the movement tendencies of the average player. You can probably find a few maps on the internet of the shrooming patterns a teemo should follow, though a good teemo will still adapt. As someone who used to main teemo, I could quite comfortably enter toplane and not get hit by a single mushroom the entire game so long as the teemo does not adjust his shrooming patterns. I can't explain this quickly but a tip is that a teemo will generally not place shrooms along the edges of walls so they're safe like 90% of the time since for the teemo, the odds of someone walking there isn't worth it.","replies":[{"poster":"BRUSHED","date":"2016-12-24T12:21:41.892+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I think you miss understand why i'm bringing this up, the changes I proposed on Teemo wouldn't change his current nieché he would still be a counter pick champion and a great lane bully. What these changes would do is give Teemo a skill based counterplay method taking out the luck based parameters of the champion. invisible traps that come up every 20 seconds that can be on the other side of the map to him without disappearing or dissipating when compared to current sweeping items and abilities which are all in the high 1 minute - 2 minute cool downs is luck.\nyou can sweep all day but you will never get all the mushrooms. this kind of play style is of the old riot games, it is unavoidable. \nthough you are right with the current method of play on Teemo's mushrooms it would still be nice to give players a chance to avoid them outside of actual vision sweeping.\n\nAre the changes I suggested to much for you is that it? do you feel like they would completely destroy his play style to a point of him being a completely different champion? \nyou do have to admit his kit is dated and needs a refresh, what i want to know is if you have some suggestions on what you would change on him :0","replies":[{"poster":"Nightjar","date":"2016-12-24T17:59:58.581+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I feel that teemo is one of those champions that is supposed to be gimpy and to be honest, given that teemo isn't really as good as caitlynn in terms of viability, would it really be fair to make his signature ult something that can't even match her w traps. The shrooms aren't really luck though if you're really having trouble running into teemo shrooms, you again might want to walk along walls and also buy control wards since these not only make the teemo shrooms visible, but also means that unlike pinks, if you use a control ward to disable a trap, your idiot teammates can't trigger it anyway. You can also use minions and jungle camps to trip any teemo traps will be in an area. Outside of his shrooms, teemo isn't really a strong champion and it's core to his kit. \n\nHis shrooms allow him to bully in lane, they give him the vision needed to splitpush, they allow teemo to premeditate an assassination and they are a core component in making up for his lack of mobility. I mean teemo is basically a squishy short range snowbally apc taken toplane, if it wasn't for his invisible shrooms giving him a heads up of any ganks, he'd be the easiest toplaner to camp and shut down, since with how teemo's kit works, if he falls behind he's screwed. If you tried to change his ult like you said, without a rework of the rest of his kit, I could see teemo becoming one of the weakest toplaners.\n\nYou're trying to come up with rework ideas for a champion, you don't play. You should try to play and get an understanding of a champion before suggesting changes. \n\nLike if I had to rework teemo, I'd probably mess with his q (making it either a simple skillshot or when pairing it with the w change, I'd shorten the blind duration) and w (changing the way the active side of this ability so that it costs more mana and gives a shorter duration of a stronger movespeed buff, making it more effective for dodging skillshots and sudden repositioning but less effective at travelling across the map because in it's current state, it's generally just spammed to travel to lane and across the map and less in combat, also making the passive movespeed be disabled when the ability is on cooldown, like master yi's wuju style) but the passive and ult are kinda key pieces of his identity, as cancerous as they are.\n\nDuskblade is a step in the right direction for counterplay for trap champions but there need to be more options for other classes. Also a good counterplay to the blind for melee toplaners is to buy a banshees since teemo only has 2 spells that can be spell shielded, the shroom or the blind which makes trading or all-in-ing him a bit easier.","replies":[{"poster":"Nightjar","date":"2016-12-25T09:26:42.170+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"More condensed version: \n\nTeemo's shrooms are his only reliable defensive tool for a champion that doesn't really have much mobility, range, any hard cc or escape mechanics. So if you changed these from what they are currently, teemo in his current form and identity would be royally screwed. \n\nIf you're having trouble avoiding shrooms, try to hug walls when pathfinding (this helps so much more than you'd think it does) and buy control wards and red trinkets.\n\nDuskblade is nice but I also think lightbringer (that crit antitrap item) and arcane sweeper (that tanky antitrap item) would be good on summoners rift to help give more counterplay to trap items without making them worthless because again, you have to go out of your way to buy these antitrap items. Maybe make an AP anti trap item as well?\n\nBut I don't think teemo is a champion who really needs a major rework since he has a very clearly defined identity and he's relatively balanced and is sometimes situationally useful for keeping snowbally toplaners like riven, fiora, darius, irelia, rengar, renekton and tryndamere in check during the earlygame provided you know how to play the matchup.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}
