I offered to reroll, used my two rerolls and ended up with {{champion:86}} . Don&#039;t get me wrong, I like {{champion:86}}  but I just feel so cheated.\r\n\r\n Then he had the nerve to deny what happened and pretend he was afk and never saw the conditions I gave (giving back {{champion:22}} ) for the rerolls. Apparently he was afk but he somehow managed to accept the trade, change keystones, masteries and summoner spells. Afk my ass. Never sharing my rerolls again. Lesson Learned. We lost the game.
