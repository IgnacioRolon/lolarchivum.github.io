I have tried messing with the Nvidia 3D settings which provided seemingly temporary relief but the issue eventually came back.\r\n\r\nAnd I also tried a complete factory reset multiple times which surprisingly fixed the problem for a short while (~1 day) then the issue randomly came back again without making any setting changes.\r\n\r\n-I have updated drivers and reinstalled drivers as well as tried older versions of drivers.\r\n-I Have re -downloaded the LoL files.\r\n-I have made all the changes suggesting in the FPS troubleshooting LoL guide\r\n-Temperature is fine given it&#039;s a brand new PC\r\n-I have ran a few virus scans but the probability it&#039;s a virus is very low given it&#039;s a new PC.\r\n\r\nI&#039;ve noticed that changes such as vsync off and some lower Nvidia 3D settings make the problem seemingly less frequent but it still occurs.\r\n\r\nI would greatly appreciate any advice as to what I can try to fix this problem.\r\nI would like to think that my PC should be able to run LoL with ease even on the highest settings which it does apart from these FPS drops.\r\n\r\nThanks very much in advance! :)\r\n\r\n-Conrad\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nP.S I have already submitted a ticket to the LoL support website and they give me a generic copy and paste answer telling me to try everything I already have tried.","replies":[{"poster":"Jimz","date":"2015-07-20T13:40:20.112+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"Are you sure it's fps drop?

Very weird it's like something is telling my PC to slow down for a second.\n\nFirst thing that would come to mind would be perhaps overheating but the PC is brand new and it feels really cool. However I guess I should actually measure the temp and see if this may be the issue but I doubt it.","replies":[{"poster":"CoIa","date":"2015-07-21T02:01:32.869+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey Conrad,\n\nI agree with you ever since 5.12 client i have also noticed FPS drops when engaging in team fights.\n\nAt first i thought it might just be my computer but i have noticed it over other computer that the FPS Drops are alot bigger when going into team fights than they use to be.","replies":[{"poster":"Conrad","date":"2015-07-21T10:14:21.130+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey Colaja\n\nThat's reassuring to know however I suspect my problem may be to do with my PC in general and not necessarily because of the LoL client however if I get this issue fixed and it turns out to be LoL related I will let you know to see if it may help with the issue you are having :)","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"SmurfAtlas","date":"2017-08-01T13:33:20.740+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hello Conrad.\nI have the exact same computer as you and was curious if you could solve the issue because I am having exactly the same issue.\nRandom fps drops from 140 to 20-40 fps, but not necessarily in teamfights.
