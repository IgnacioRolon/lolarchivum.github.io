Use that report. I'd rather turn my chat off than deal with the toxicity that happens in the chat, especially when 1 player isn't doing so hot.\n\nI'll be the first to admit that I absolutely suck at League, but that doesn't stop me from trying to play. What stops me from trying to play is people flaming me in chat because they can obviously do better than me, and feel the need to flame and provoke me for being bad, instead of supporting me and telling me what I could've done differently.\n\nBecause of this, I've gotten into the habit of seriously not giving 2 flips anymore and turning off my chat the moment the game starts, but I still make an attempt to help the team.\n\nYes, I understand there are people who intentionally wander the map doing nothing, but that's called Griefing, and there's an option for report for that. But what you're saying is people like me, who refuse to deal with toxic people and thus mute everyone, should be reported/banned/punished for simply not wanting to be hurt psychologically because of verbal abuse.\n\nSo to you, my friend, I say: Learn the reason WHY people grief/ignore you, before you jump to accusations.","replies":[{"poster":"Toxic Shaco","date":"2016-04-03T04:27:02.452+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"They don't get punished for it though.\n\nYou report them for griefing and because they aren't 0-20-0 and they aren't abusing anyone, they get away with it.\n\n\nRespecting your team is part of teamwork, but so is having thick skin. You muting everyone off the bat is just as detrimental as someone throwing an insult. It works both ways. Being part of a team is being able to overlook the negativity and concentrate on the common goal.","replies":[{"poster":"Apexslide","date":"2016-04-03T06:24:07.517+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"How are you so certain about that? Do you have a source justifying your claim? Because you're really spouting dribble otherwise. I really don't think you know how the detection and reporting system even works, intentional griefing is always reviewed and if the automated system deems it appropriate to act (3+ games of 0/x/x etc), then it will act. But ALL games are recorded by internal servers, exactly like DOTA, and they stay on these servers for a minimum of 6 hours, so if the system punished someone for it, the person can make an appeal and talk to a support employee about it, who will then review those matches and check for things like intentionally walking into the turrets when there's no reason to (different from a tower dive).\n\nRespect for the team is not giving in to toxic players like yourself, and using smart-pings in place of it. Ever heard of a chat ban? There are two types, the most common being All-chat ban, the second, which you'll be hard-pressed to find evidence for, is simple Chat ban. In such case as the latter, Pings are used for the sole reason of communicating with the team.\n\nIf I decide to mute everyone because you're all toxic pieces of bantha foodoo, then I will. It doesn't effect the team, because all the team really cares about is winning, and will /ff the moment a single thing doesn't go their way, or flame the person with the least kills or most deaths because hey, why the flip not?\n\nSo I stand by what I said, and I really only have one thing to say to you for now: Deal With It.","replies":[]}]}]}]}
