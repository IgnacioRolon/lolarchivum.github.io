Go back to playing with crayons and eating glue; its more your level.\n\nHes a fucking tank. Why does he need high AD?\n\nHe already gets two fucking items worth of resistances for free on his W, why does he need AD? Or even better, why does his ultimate hit harder than Nunu and Fiddlesticks, expecially when it affects towers.\n\nImagine the outrage if one half of an ADC spell gave them 130AD with 70% uptime.\n\nBut don&#039;t worry, alistars heal 2 stronk pls nerf, thats your priority.\n\n\n\nTLDR: Is there a legitimate reason why Rammus gets so much for free? \n(most damaging ult, free AD, free defensives)","replies":[{"poster":"Dream","date":"2016-03-17T23:07:17.486+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yes game is bad now in my opinion, I don't understand why they have tank items that give damage attributes or passives it ruins the game, Tanks shouldn't be able to build full tank items and 100-0 carries easily, they should simply be tank, sadly I think Riot are more interested in making a fun and exciting game rather than a balanced one (Tanks aren't fun if they do literally 0 dmg).","replies":[]},{"poster":"Klavinmour","date":"2016-03-13T16:11:43.420+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"So where is your international game company that makes the most popular game in the world?","replies":[{"poster":"Toxic Shaco","date":"2016-03-13T16:31:20.134+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It used to be good.\nGet a good reputation.\nGet normies playing.\nTurn to shit.\nJerk to your e-sports.","replies":[]}]}]}
