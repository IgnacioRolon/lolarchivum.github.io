It means that if they do land their skills there is even less chance of you surviving.\r\n\r\nWhy do champs have these high impact skill shots if they don&#039;t need them to kill a target?","replies":[{"poster":"Rocka","date":"2015-11-20T01:42:40.199+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"thats because they are burst champions they need the really high damage.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Zorphiax","date":"2015-11-21T06:47:43.713+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"So, what? you miss a skill shot you lose the health that your opponent should have lost?","replies":[]}]}
