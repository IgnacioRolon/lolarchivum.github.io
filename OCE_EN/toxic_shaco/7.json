If you got 15/4/17 and got 180 cs at the 20-30 min mark then yes, you would get an S, but if it was a 30-40 min game, then ofc you would not get an S. They grade cs by how much you get per min. Not only does CS take a heavy place but so does wards placed/damage dealt/damage taken/kill partipitation ect. So Riots grading system is graded BY the players","replies":[]},{"poster":"Pikachoochoo","date":"2016-11-06T19:41:50.324+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Aw damn it. I can't find the guide where it says something about your mastery ranking being determined mostly by the overall level of skill/contribution of players who've played a certain champ. So pretty much get near as them + contributing to fights more (like Ninja15OZ mentioned) or set a really high new ladder to reach. LOL  here it is, found it 1/2 into the paragraph xD http://leagueoflegends.wikia.com/wiki/Champion_Mastery I'm not sure on what happens if everybody's stuck on the same rung though, you probably still get S rank + helping until nearly dead before retreating appropriately in fights a tonne and farming a lot too to get it I guess. A heavy carry k/d/a isn't the only way to earn S rank ^_^ I've been farming chests mostly by being a great, but weirdly built support :D","replies":[]},{"poster":"Pikachoochoo","date":"2016-11-06T19:33:45.265+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Ooh yeah, that too! ^","replies":[]}]}
