I imagine that outside of lane phase it's less useful than other options but how you're supposed to get there is what you're asking. \n\nIt's a tough call. Surviving relies on your lane being coordinated enough to last the time the tether takes to activate and the shield expires (6 seconds). It's possible that if you're already rooted it's too late, which means avoiding that scenario is going to be your best bet.\n\nYou could break the tether with a dash or, unfortunately, flash. Never stand in her range so that she is able to tether in the first place. Poke her early so she is less inclined to play aggressive. Stand way back and punish if she oversteps. Attempt to freeze the lane just outside of tower range?\n\nI don't know. Depending on the match up, there's a chance you might have to sacrifice minions sometimes. Maybe that's the best you hope for. If you don't outright lose the lane you should have a chance of bringing it back later. Courage shouldn't be such a problem during team fights if your team works together. \n\nSorry I can't be more concrete but I hope that helps.","replies":[]},{"poster":"KawtYouNow","date":"2016-11-17T00:46:22.558+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"That mastery i have found to be amazing on Renekton due to his W and Darius due to his E.
