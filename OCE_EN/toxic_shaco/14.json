But there are a few ways to beat him.\n\n-Like you mentioned, counterpicking. Lissandra is personal favourite counter Fizz, she has really good lane phase poke which Fizz lacks, good disengage, enough cc to keep the slippery fuck still and can tomb herself to avoid Fizz's E+R and apply the ult damage. Kassadin and Leblanc are also decent matchups. Ahri and Zed are skill matchups but have just as much potential to fuck Fizz as he can to them.\n\n-Barrier or Exhaust. Fizz is an all in champion, taking a summoner that renders that all in useless is very important. A well timed exhaust will cut his Pole and Fish damage down massively. Also a well timed barrier will negate lots of it.\n\n-Just turret hug. If you're playing a champion that can absolutely not fight fizz under any circumstance at all, just stay far away from the back, and then some more. Any decent mid laner can pick up most cs that falls under turret. Fizz can't punish you much if he pushes you in, since he has no poke. If he wants to take advantage of the push by killing you, he has to go all in, under turret. And then it's all about individual player skill.","replies":[{"poster":"Toxic Shaco","date":"2016-04-01T09:43:07.709+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Out of all the champions in the game, Fizz could probably dive you the easiest.\n\n\nExhaust lets you live once.

If he's taken CDR runes, then hes sacrificed MR. You have a lot of opportunity to try and force out his E with a low mana cost spell. If he uses his E aggressively it will push the lane. You can freeze against Fizz very easily in the early game as he wont be able to get any decent poke off and can certainly not dive you without eating through his entire mana/hp pool doing so. \n\nFreeze the wave and bait out his e with ANY CD's necessary. Then communicate to your jungler what is happening. Let him know the lane is frozen and Fizz is overextending. Communicate where any wards have been laid to make it easy for them.","replies":[]},{"poster":"I am Khajiit","date":"2016-04-04T05:40:49.071+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It comes with experience and doesn't really have anything to do with the opponent having a brain. For example In a matchup of zed vs fizz, zed needs to practically all in aggressively to force fizz to use E before getting to low before zed using his ult. Or alternatively, initially ulting fizz, making him think he's about to go all in but instead continuing with a non ult reliant combo after baiting out the E, given fizz isn't full HP before the start of this scenario.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Requiemsfire","date":"2016-04-03T10:40:31.569+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"This is a case of just simply having to understand how Fizz works and functions as a champion in the mid lane. \n\nFirst part I would say is understand the range of his E, it's actually really short range and does have limitations. Knowing this will enable you to predict and dodge his E.\n\nSecondly, watching for a glow in his trident, if it glows it'll cause additional magic damage dealt to you from his autos and abilities and for that reason some fizz's would use it before they engage. This is his W ability. \n\nThirdly don't play someone with melee abilities unless they specifically have CC and burst damage to deal early on. The reason for this is because Fizz has a lot of mobility and damage but like every single champion he needs gold. If you play someone with a lot of poke potential you can effectively punish him for going for cs. If he wastes his E, this is an opportunity to punish him for a few seconds by throwing all your CC at him while he tries to make an escape. Even if it is without securing a kill Fizz will most likely be forced out of the lane which puts you a little ahead in exp and gold and that can make an incredible difference. \n\nFinally if you're laning against him build magic resist. It's really effective, if you're an assassin build maw, if you're a mage build abyssal scepter or athenes unholy grail or even Zhonyas hourglass. Don't stick to a copy/paste build. \n\nYes Fizz himself is an extremely powerful champion when used correctly but he isn't unbeatable. CC is his prime weakness. You not dying also slows him down significantly. If you can't win then survive the laning phase. \nHope this helps. :)","replies":[]},{"poster":"Nijel","date":"2016-04-02T09:54:40.791+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I've always had trouble with Fizz too. \n\nThe general idea is to poke and deny him so that he'll be forced to go back. The reason that's more difficult than it sounds is that he's probably going to try trade back if you're careless. Never all in since his seastone trident + ignite do serious damage, especially when he's baited out one of your abilities and you weren't able to in return. Even if neither of you die he's probably going to out sustain you if he started corrupting potion. Try your best to not let him trade back.\n\nIf you're still having trouble, stop trying to win lane and figure out how to not lose lane. Play patiently and methodically and focus on surviving. If you've picked a decent teamfighting champion you can wait until the midgame and hope you are coordinated enough to beat him.","replies":[{"poster":"Toxic Shaco","date":"2016-04-02T10:54:02.594+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"How do you not let him trade back, when he has two forms of gap close pre-6.\n\nHis Q range is that of most midlaner's auto attack range, so if you try to poke him with auto attacks he hard engages.\nIf you use a skill shot based spell on him, like all players, they can just walk to the side. Not very difficult when you have 'noclip' enabled.\nIf you click to target spell him and it has a missile, he will dodge it and hard engage. \nIf the above click to target spell isn't very impactful, he will probably just engage with Q instead.\n\nPast level 3 there isn't a lot you can do without him retaliating.","replies":[{"poster":"Nijel","date":"2016-04-02T13:51:23.704+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It really comes down to practice, match up and mentality.\n\nFizz has many ways to dodge and engage but he still has cooldowns and limited hp.
