These skills often take multiple games to practice and understand.\n\n If you remind someone to ward, and they ignore it or act negatively to your advice, then it's best just to forget about it and ward their lane yourself.\n\n+ Going over mistakes is something traditionally done in post-match analysis sessions, for pro League of Legends and other sports. That's because you want to reduce the amount of negativity during the match, so that it has the smallest impact possible on the game.\n\n The player who died to a gank knows he's messing up, he might not understand why, but he already knows there's something wrong. Some people wont appreciate quick tips, when they are already stressed out and worried about performing badly.\n\n+ If you really want to help players improve, try adding them after a game. The aim when doing something like this should be to respectfully point out **what went wrong**, **why it went wrong** and **how it can be prevented** next time.\n\n If the player doesn't want your advice then don't force it on them, that's their choice.\n\nI hope this helps.","replies":[{"poster":"Toxic Shaco","date":"2016-03-30T07:53:55.006+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"I am not asking what is reportable and what is not.

However much like muting this is not reportable, because its far more important for us to protect each player's right to play what they want, than it is for us to protect team winrates. This protects the *player experience*.\n\nMuting is similar to this. **Riot** is happy to protect the player experience at the expense of 1-2% winrate for the team.\n\nAFK and feeding strongly negatively impacts the player experience and this is why these are considered serious offenses and are reportable. AFKing will stop harassment for a player, but it's not the best option since winrates can be affected by [up to 35%](http://www.manaless.com/2015/05/afk-4v5-games-analysis-using-kaplan.html) and it undoubtably ruins the game for everyone else involved. Muting may to this to a very minor extent but the trade off is well worth it.\n\nThat being said, if you think you have a better idea or reform, I'm sure the player behavior team world love to hear it.
