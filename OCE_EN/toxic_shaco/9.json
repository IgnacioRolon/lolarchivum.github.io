This is not a bitch thread, just pointing out the number side of league and legitimately asking how to kill something with such high health. It legitimately seems like stacking hp is the way to go in league at the moment.\n\nYou notice the enemy team picked Rammus, and short of preparing your anus for his free win, you decide to listen to all the advice people give and pick some AP.  Given that any ADC who hits Rammus will kill themselves in a few auto attacks, it&#039;s entirely up to you to deal with the spiky menace, removing fun from league with every step he takes.\n\nLet&#039;s assume that for some reason he still itemizes purely armor, despite having magic damage on the enemy team.\n\n{{item:3068}} {{item:3143}} {{item:3742}} {{item:3075}} {{item:3083}}  seems reasonable. High armor, high health, no AD will ever kill me now!\n\nIt looks as though he is vulnerable to magic damage right?! Right?!\nHealth wise\n500 + 500 + 500 + 0 + 800 = 2300 + 2026(base) = 4326 total health. \n\nHis base magic resist at 18 is 53, and his W gives him 120. He is probably likely to take 12MR in runes.\nThis puts him at 189. No MR items, 189 MR. \n\nLet&#039;s assume that even though he has built no MR, you will still pick up a Void staff, and take Sorc boots. You have 8 from runes and 8 from tree (Precision). That&#039;s brought the deathball down to 91MR, or better put, 47% reduction to magic damage.\n\nI don&#039;t think I can think of any mage who can do 4326 damage in a _reasonable_ amount of time, let alone 8652 after his MR does it&#039;s job.\n\nGiven that mages are usually bursty, or have cycles of damage, how can anybody assume that they are to kill people with such high health?\n\nIt is different with armor/health because physical damage is usually sustained, so you are constantly taking a barrage of damage and there isn&#039;t a threshhold of health you need.\n\nWith mages, once you reach enough raw health (not effective health) to live through their burst, the MR you have just makes you untouchable. Without any MR items your health pool doubles. If you were to build a ZZ&#039;Rot or a Spirit Visage it would nearly triple.\n\nI&#039;m aware that burst mages aren&#039;t supposed to deal with the frontliners, but in the case of Rammus (anyone with thornmail for that matter), no one else on your team can touch him.\n\nIt seems that there is no kill potential on targets who have high health, because the innate MR they have sends the amount of damage required to kill them through the roof.\n\nIf I am seeing it wrong, please point it out.. but from a number point of view I can&#039;t understand how a Lux (full combo at 1kap does 3050raw) is supposed to kill someone who needs 3 times her full damage to die.\n\nEDIT: The stats can't be wrong.  \nThere is a reason that 7/10 of the highest win rate champs are high health, top/jungle, tanky champs. They also have been flooding the win rates for a very long time.","replies":[{"poster":"Icarus1314","date":"2016-03-12T07:08:06.199+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Why no just kill everyone else...\nI mean...

Rammus is very strong against a lot of team comps, but mages like {{champion:76}} {{champion:25}} {{champion:161}} {{champion:268}} {{champion:101}} {{champion:115}} {{champion:99}} all have significant range and some form of CC/Zone potential to be able to poke down Rammus. Your calculations above have been done all from a full HP/hard engage perspective, which is playing to Rammus strengths.\n\nIn a hard engage from full HP Rammus is EXTREMELY hard to kill. Trust me one of my most played in Diamond 1 Currently is Rammus and I know how easy it is to steamroll a team. However if you can't get an engage and are against a poke comp he really struggles. His W has to be used to resist poke, and then when it is down he cant really tank/engage the mages nearly as effectively. His Q takes a while to charge up, so its pretty easy to know when hes looking for an engage and gives a decent amount of time to backup. On this note though, **WARD YOUR FLANKS**. If hes not in vision, he will be able to get to you very easily. Ward your flanks and watch for him coming around. Poke and disengage then reform and go back to a siege position.\n\nTry looking for an early {{item:3135}} + {{item:3151}} combo on mid lane champs that have poke to be able to take Rammus down very easily. His W is core to his kit vs mages but is on a reasonably long cooldown. Rammus can't build CDR as none of the items that give it synergize with his kit. {{item:3110}} Slows Attackspeed which is not what Rammus wants.\n\nOne thing people don't realize is that Maw of Malmortius {{item:3156}}  on ADC's is Extremely useful against Rammus.\nHis Q,W,R {{item:3075}}  and Cindehulk/{{item:3068}}  do magic damage. ALOT of it. Maw of malmortius when low gives a nice chunk of shield to mitigate this damage as well as giving an additional lifesteal/Spellvamp and Attackspeed steroid to help sustain and take him down without dying in the length of a taunt.\n\nLastly I'd like to mention the remake of the Warlord's Bloodlust Mastery. This gives up to 20% lifesteal when on low HP. Taking this on an ADC when there is a Rammus in the game gives you a huge advantage, as paired with some armor penetration {{item:3036}}  and a {{item:3072}}  (and Maw in the late game) will give you obscene amounts of lifesteal. (also you'll get the 7% armor penetration to help with cutting through him from the same tree.) Rammus lacks burst damage, so these things should be able to keep an ADC alive long enough for your team to peel and kill the Rammus effectively. \n\nBut I do want to stress the importance of DO NOT ENGAGE HIM FROM FULL HP. POKE AND DISENGAGE IS KEY!","replies":[]},{"poster":"TrashDonnut","date":"2016-03-13T11:45:57.770+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Fucking Brand with Rylai's m8.\n\nSlowed to Death.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Talon12","date":"2016-03-12T10:58:07.666+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"cough 5v1 the out of place turdle","replies":[]},{"poster":"Olee","date":"2016-03-12T10:18:37.686+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Enter {{champion:67}} \n\nor if you really wanted sustained magic damage {{champion:268}} {{champion:69}} , unfortunately, neither of them are in the best spot right now","replies":[]},{"poster":"M2001ARYAN","date":"2016-03-12T08:23:38.459+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You're right that it is really tough to kill Rammus with these stats.
