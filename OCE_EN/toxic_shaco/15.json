Then that ends up biting you in the back. TBH I don't really give a honk if someone starts aggressively swearing and slurring at me because I'm bad or whatever. The only time I get pissed is when I die once and they criticize me based on that one mistake, for the rest of the game. I get so involved in proving them wrong that I forget to play the game.\n\nBy the way, it seems to me that you have little respect for Riot as a company. Don't know exactly how you can hate on a free-to-play recreational and professional game, especially as no-one forces people to play it. It's not like Riot goes fishing for trolls and anger-issued people. Your opinionistic and well explained and informed eye to these moral matters would be much better utilized in politics. I mean we are forced to have a prime-minister and obey laws, America is forced to have Trump, kids getting bullied are forced to put up with it in their lives and yet you are basically trash talking other trash talkers, but more specifically, trash talking the company that makes a game. \n\nLike everyone has a freedom of speech, you do too, even toxic people believe it or not, it is just simply the EULA and social morals that society has created that prevent people from been a pile o' mangos on games. Don't get me wrong, I don't advise for toxic behavior as sensitive people can actually get sad, but as a person who has realized the same way Riot has that it is such a minor issue in our community as you can mute them. If you are a well composed person you don't even care in the first place. But if you are sensitive, or have been through a lot like a bunch of people, it literally takes 1 click of 1 button to shut them up. But no. People get so invested in making the other guy feel bad about there actions, like they expect a \"oh man your right, i'm sorry, won't do it again'. These people are delusional, Riot has realized that people who try to argue with toxic people are just toxic people that need to be provoked. It's how everyone is. Toxic players aren't always toxic btw. Sometimes they are having a bad day and be rude one game, and then someone starts going off their chops at em for barely getting provoked.\n\nSorry that I was ranting on about my opinion as a whole, and sorry that it didn't have much context or relevance to your post, but I just needed to get that off my chest. Riot is trying to focus more on their games actual content, and less and less about toxic players who can be silenced FOR FREE. Doesn't cost you nothing. Pretty sweet deal, right? \n\nAnd before I leave, reply to me however, explain how I'm wrong, criticize my content of argument, whatever. But if you even mention the good ol';\n\"It doesn't matter because by the time you mute someone the damage has to have been done first.\"\nI find this hard to believe as the second someone shows their dis-appreciation to you as a team member, you shouldn't bother talking to them. Of course if you're a fellow like me who just plays for S&G, then toxicity doesn't bother you in the slightest, and I suggest to people who get upset by toxic players and don't mute this:\n\n1. If you are a kid, your parent should be monitoring your behavior and your experiences online. Teenagers love to be rebellious online because they are anonymous. If your kid gets upset by people abusing them and such, their parents should know by then and help them.\n\n2. If you are an adolescent or older, I don't know what has happened in your life but if you need help, there are lots of organizations dedicated to helping people that get anxiety in games, same with lots of therapists that can help you employ strategies into your life to help you with this. Of course if you are just a normal person that gets mad over these guys, eat some food. Take a break. Always keep a bottle of water on your desk. I rage A LOT when I'm hungry, even in real life, WAY more than normal. But get this, I eat food. WOWOOWOOWOWOOOWO!!!!\n\n3. If you are one of those guys that goes out of there way to be an SJW and asses the toxic person on every thing he says and start arguing, newsflash, you're toxic too. \n\nPls forgive me this should be up in a separate thread but I already started it so gg.\n\nNot Riot's job to fix 33 million people's behavior.","replies":[]},{"poster":"iHooD","date":"2016-03-30T06:33:18.611+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Pretty spot on!

And for as long as high ranking tournaments are doing well, they won't do anything about changing the game to make it actually worth putting as much effort as I put in tonight.
