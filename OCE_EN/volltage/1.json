After this i decided I didnt want to play a game, only to return later and again, click the button thinking it was just a one off. SAME GOD DAMN THING HAPPENS! this time a 30 minute penalty ensues. Pretty damn frustrated with the whole thing seeing as i now cant get a game in before work.  \r\n\r\nI&#039;d appreciate some form of compensation, even just having my history of queue dodging wiped clean so as to avoid huge penalties in future. \r\nI know someone is going to pipe up and say something about me having to of offended in the past to recieve this penalty, but I would never leave a queue on purpose unless something serious has happened. I&#039;ve been bugsplatted and crashed from queue multiple times, it just doesn&#039;t seem fair to someone just trying to enjoy the game? I think there needs to be a better system that recognises when a client crashes and when the game/champion select is purposefully dodged, surely riot could detect whether or not the close game/leave game button is clicked.","replies":[]}
