Same with Bard&#039;s ult but that is an AoE).\n\nSo, with those three points in mind, do you think Riot should make Tryndamere's ultimate have a negative effect? Activating his Q has a negative effect as seen in losing critical strike chance (and possibly canceling the heal from his ultimate).\n\nSo, what do you think?\n{{sticker:slayer-pantheon-thumbs}}","replies":[{"poster":"Azirious Mistake","date":"2015-11-14T05:20:15.773+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Point two: Berserkers are well known for having power at a disadvantage, like Olaf's E (damage if doesn't kill) and R (activation removes passive).\n\nStopped reading here.","replies":[{"poster":"UltraFireFX","date":"2015-11-14T12:12:46.048+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Nice name, bad attitude.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Icy lock","date":"2015-11-14T08:06:31.692+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Because i hate tryndamere, im obviously going to vote negative effect, sorry trynd mains :( . Maybe like he dies after using it if he has taken a certain amount of damage? i mean, thematically it would make sense, as in, rage fills him and he gets enough strength to surive for 6 seconds, but if he takes 600/700/800 damage during the during the duration of his rage, he dies.","replies":[{"poster":"UltraFireFX","date":"2015-11-14T12:12:19.355+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I had an idea myself going something like if he doesn't get a kill a portion (scaling down with level) of the damage he blocked would be dealt to him as true damage (and that damage would be as a tool-tip for him and others) giving the other team some counter-play in the regards of CC to stop him getting there and damage to kill him.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Olee","date":"2015-11-14T10:17:39.709+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I reckon gutting his AD during his ult would be good","replies":[]},{"poster":"Khizzar","date":"2015-11-14T09:14:58.075+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I think you've got a good point here but tryndamere is pretty weak anyway so if you were going to add in that negative effect then you would have to buff him in other areas.","replies":[]}]}
