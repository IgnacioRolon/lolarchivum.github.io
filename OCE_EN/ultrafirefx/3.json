Having no resource bar should not co-exist with such a huge cooldown buff like her passive.\n\n* **Passive (Voracity):**\nChange: No changes except for a cooldown of ~10 seconds after being activated (actual cooldown to be debated).\nReasons: Katarina thrives on her passive, but people feel it is too powerful (except for Katarina mains, of course) to be able to be activated so often, which allows her to get easy pentas\n\n* **Q (Bouncing Blades):**\nNo changes\n\n* **W (Sinister Steel):**\nNo changes\n\n* **E (Shunpo):**\nChanges: Double the cooldown reduction and energy cost, if the target is an enemy, reduce cooldown by 50% and refund 50% of the energy cost\nReasons: \nNote: Katarina&#039;s E isn&#039;t changed when jumping to enemies, however, jumping to allies doubles the CD and cost, making her more of an all in champion.\n\n* **R (Death Lotus):**\nChanges: I&#039;d like to see the her either only be able to target one champion with her ult or deal less damage to the other two but I&#039;m not sure how much all the Katarina mains can take, after all, she&#039;s an ASSASSIN.\n\nPlease discuss (constructively) below about how you feel about my suggestions and if you believe Katarina should get one or more of these implemented.\nNote: I worked on some of these ideas with some friends of mine and people in solo queue.","replies":[{"poster":"Jink","date":"2015-05-03T10:04:05.505+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"If an Assassin kills one of your team - Kat being a strong 1st or second initiator; it's basically GG anyway and she punishes teams that like to sit in the back lines behind a support and big range ADC and poke or jump in after engages with CC because they'll get bursted next and she can poke after that - teams with strong engage like Jarvan and Sejuani help counter her because they take the front line and can handle a bit of poke and enemies like Malzahar and Viktor can destroy her engages forcing her to play more passive and then she can't fully utilize her resets and in reality doesn't do half as much damage, half as effectively or safely as other AP's.\n\nShe can't poke hugely, she all ins on her ulti and cleans up if someone has been caught out and then can start to be as effective as other AP mids and in my opinion she's a bit underpowered right now because her main item was nerfed as was her kit (her Q nerf made her easier to lane against and now her passive Voracity has been made less effective) Champions like Viktor can Laser repeatedly for huge burst damage and play defensively, Champions like Xerath can poke hugely, Champions like Ahri can catch out enemies and CC people and chase them down, Champions like Fizz can one shit people and get away scott free - Katarina takes skill to do this and if she snowballs out of control not even your ganks will work on her and she can effectively 3v1 and kill all 3 of you if you don't have a lot of CC. CC destroys her while it doesn't do a lot to other AP mids and there is an abundance of CC in the league that can interrupt her ultimate, making her all-in do 0 damage at which point she is useless for most of the fight or simply KS's a few kills with a 500 damage combo whereas other Champions have consistent almost unrestricted huge range 500-600 damage combos.","replies":[{"poster":"UltraFireFX","date":"2015-05-03T12:33:24.195+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"You referenced Katarina poking, then you followed up by saying she can't poke hugely, her bouncing blades along with Luden's Echo and a bit of AP allows Katarina to deal quite pokey damage.\n\nYou also mentioned her passive being less effective, this is only true for gaining assists as she needs to deal damage in the last 3 seconds before they die.\n\nWith Fizz's nerf, it's very hard to \"one-shot\" people and get out \"scotch-free\", Katarina shunpos in, takes reduced damage, splashes down the entire team, gets 1+ kills and shunpos out while only taking a few tower or marksman shots, not that bad in my opinion.\n\nWhen she goes in, people tend to use their CC to stop her, but she can shunpo away or to said champion and dodges the CC entirely, which allows her to follow up with her ult, it's also very hard to CC her ult when she doesn't even need to, if she has snowballed that much already.\n\nCC does not destroy her, she still deals tonnes of damage with all of her basic abilities.\n\nFurthermore, name some of those \"consistent huge damage\" champions for my future reference please.","replies":[{"poster":"Jink","date":"2015-05-03T12:39:14.480+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"She can poke but not as insanely as some Champions even when ridiculously fed.\n\n\nViktor.\nXerath.\nNidalee.\nTwisted Fate.\nKennen.\nZiggs.\n\nAll these Champions with the same items as Katarina poke 5x as hard and much as Katarina.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Olee","date":"2015-05-03T09:19:23.765+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Kat needs no nerf anymore lel","replies":[]},{"poster":"Bipolar","date":"2015-05-05T04:05:15.234+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You would fit well at Riot when your entire suggestion is just nerfing base abilities.
