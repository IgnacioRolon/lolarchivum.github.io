They also seem to have a uncanny ability to get level 2 lux. What is up with these bots? I would really like to hear from riot member about this.","replies":[{"poster":"Av√ì","date":"2020-02-15T05:37:21.403+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'm running into the exact same situation, I would love a response from Riot about what is going on.
