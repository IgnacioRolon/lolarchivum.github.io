( i logged into mobile today to try it and i cant even select my little legends or arenas anymore)\r\nThe original pc oce tft faithful players that i would often see, I never see anymore.\r\nWhats the point of saying gg? when 7 of 8 players have no chat.\r\nNot to mention the possibility of cheating, bots,  hacks and stuff like that. Which is hard to ignore when 3+ other players have 50+ gold at krugs.\r\nWith a quick google search of tft hacks shows they exist, top result shows some sort of gold hack thats been downloaded over 500,000 times!\r\n\r\nI think the mobile tft players should play only with other mobile players at least until the clients are equal.","replies":[]}
