I never claim to be. Hence why I keep playing to get better.\r\nHowever, in a community like this, how do you do that?\r\nAfter quitting league on and off, I decided to come back once again, with the condition that I never play solo.\r\nToday I broke that rule. Solo norms here I go.\r\nImagine this: I play {{champion:25}} for the first time in a long time. Support. I&#039;m not the best at her, hence why I want to practice.\r\nWell after missing 2 Q&#039;s out of 5 and my {{champion:51}} dies ONCE while I was OOM trying to save her, she deserts me, calls me terrible and says I can&#039;t hit a single Q. {{champion:23}} also joins in and calls me terrible because he died to a 2v1 he rammed his head into while I had all abilities on cd. {{champion:28}} disconnects and never returns. Poor {{champion:13}} is sitting there trying his best not to afk and just tells me to report it.\r\nI didn&#039;t harass, abuse, use profanity, or anything towards them, but obviously they did it back to me. That game didn&#039;t even get to 20 minutes.\r\n\r\nThis got me wondering, in a game that is KNOWN to have a community that is so toxic, rude and salty, how come there is still not solution to treat this after 6 years? I get that competitive games such as DOTA 2 and CS:GO are also quite toxic but even I don&#039;t see it as toxic as this game. That&#039;s saying something. How can Riot sit there and kind of just... accept it?\r\n\r\nI used to play this game a lot with friends. Barely any of them play now. My boyfriend outright REFUSES to play this game because after 2 years of the horrible community, he gave up on its negativity. He REFUSES to even talk about this game because he says it is the &#039;cancer of all games&#039;. And no, he isn&#039;t bronze. To have a reputation like that, can you be proud to say you play this game? &quot;Hey what are you currently playing&quot; &quot;League of L-&quot; &quot;-groans- what a crap game&quot;.\r\n\r\nTL;DR: In a community so toxic, how exactly can you keep players like my friends and myself from continuing to play, put money into it (yes we stupidly put thousands of dollars COLLECTIVELY into this game), try to better ourselves by improving, try to have even an ounce of fun with this game, when a community like this exists? Is there proof that Riot even remotely cares about fixing this game? The whole point of this is to not go &quot;if you don&#039;t like it, leave&quot;, it&#039;s more of a &quot;don&#039;t like it? let&#039;s see why&quot;.","replies":[{"poster":"Hyde","date":"2016-05-11T04:18:19.588+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"I understand that some people are toxic and stupid and just downright negative but I think a lot of people who play this game only focus on those people. No one actually recognises the majority of players who are really nice and decent to play with (I don't mean skills). The fact this post is about all the negative players on your team just goes to show. What you should be focusing on is that one {{champion:13}}  player who stuck with it and just said to report them. Its all very well to say the game is toxic and the community are all horrible people but when it comes down to it it is more about how you as a person and player respond to that kind of behaviour. You can either choose to look at the bad and negative side and develop a hatred toward the game or you can simply not let that affect you (after all ... its just a game, I know its not that simple .. but really I mean, it is) or you can choose to thank the players who treat you well and enjoy it when they stand up for you and in return stand up for them. That is the only way your problems are going to be solved. not by hating on others but by changing the way you see them.","replies":[]},{"poster":"RonyStark","date":"2016-05-11T01:58:16.740+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"At first I was raging just like you against these derps.\nBut then I realise something.\nI dont know about you but as for me, I use League of Legends as a means for me to learn and grow.\nIt is not just about the gameplay and skills, but it can also be about how well we deal with any situations.\n\nBasically LoL is somewhat a life simulation for me.\nWe cannot expect anything or anyone to be perfect, whether in the game or in real life.\nAnd we cannot do anything about the others imperfectness.\n\nSo what can we do?\nThat is to improve ourselves to be better in skills, quick-decision making, accepting defeat, being grace in victory, no raging.\n\nAs long as we cannot achieve this, we will be stuck in our elo both in the game and in real life.\n\nHope this helps.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Tele","date":"2016-05-11T09:56:22.818+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"Hey summoner,\n\nWhat you experienced in that **Morgana** game was not acceptable anywhere in League and we're sorry you had to go through that. But I want you to know that **Riot** really does care about the players.\n\nBefore **Lyte** and others at **Riot** decided to innovate on player behavior, most games didn't have reform programs, tribunals or in-depth report systems like we have now. We need to understand that toxicity is a systemic problem with the internet in general and doesn't have an easy fix.\n\nSince you asked;\n_**Here's what we have in place right now to stop toxicity:**_\n\n+ **Instant Feedback System**\n This system picks up toxic behavior very quickly and delivers punishment within 15 minutes of a game ending to stop any further damage ASAP.\n\n If you reported the players who harassed you then they would have been reviewed and possibly punished by this system. Read more about [here](http://oce.leagueoflegends.com/en/news/game-updates/player-behavior/reports-how-do-they-work) and [here](http://oce.leagueoflegends.com/en/news/game-updates/player-behavior/instant-feedback-powers).\n\n+ **The 4 Tier System**\n Toxic behavior is dealt with severely in League. We have the [4 Tier System](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/207489286-Instant-Feedback-System-FAQ-#h1q2) for this:\n\n **First Offense**: 10 Game Chat Restriction \n**Second Offense**: 25 Game Chat Restriction \n**Third Offense**: Two Week Suspension \n**Fourth Offense**: Permanent Suspension\n\n Chat restrictions provide ample time to reform, while reducing communication through chat to protect other players.\n\n+ **Mute and Language Filter**\nThe mute feature and language filters are designed to try and protect players while being harassed and prevent it from becoming severe. I'd recommend you to use them generously, especially when you feel like responding or aggravating the situation.\n\nThe player behavior team is always working to grow positive behavior and reform toxicity. From the new champion select to the honor system; these were all projects designed by player behavior for the community.\n\nI hope this helps ;)","replies":[{"poster":"LiliumZee","date":"2016-05-11T11:40:44.352+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thank you for your reply.\n\nI see now that Riot has made attempts to try to fix the toxicity. But I guess it's within the game's competitive nature that a certain handful of players act the way they do. I sometimes think it's because they themselves turn toxic because of others doing so to them. I do not want to become like that.\nMaybe there could be something like a 'good/bad behaviour' queue that let's well behaved players play with non-toxic ones, and vise versa. I don't know. It's just a small incentive for players to be well behaved or get a taste of their own medicene kind of thing. :P","replies":[{"poster":"Tele","date":"2016-05-12T05:50:11.006+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'm very glad you said that actually:\n\n+ A lot of players see toxicity in League like you do; _a small group of super toxic players feed and troll in most of their games, ruining the experience for everyone else._\n\n+ The reality is actually very different. Players with good and neutral standings account for [87%](https://youtu.be/nbYQ0AVVBGU?t=4m17s) of all toxicity in League. Players in toxic and bad standings only account for **13%** of all toxicity in League.\n\n> That doesn't mean that everyone is toxic, it just means that everyone has a bad day sometimes and falls a bit out of line. Maybe these players are _tilted? Bullied? Divorce? Illness? Stress?_ These are real people with real problems, and sometimes these troubles manifest themselves in League as toxicity.\n> \n> It doesn't make their actions justified, but it does make them understandable, and hopefully could lead to a solution as well in the future.\n\nSorry to ramble, but it was just such a great opportunity to get that info out there :)","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Vote 1 Trump","date":"2016-05-11T11:18:16.419+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> most games didn't have reform programs, tribunals or in-depth report systems like we have now\n\nThat's because most developers have read 1984.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"trolledallmylife","date":"2016-05-11T07:40:39.195+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Truth is, Riot doesn't give 1 sh it, as long as kids are paying for skins they won't care!\n\nWhy fix something which isn't broken to them? \n\n\"IF\" and \"WHEN\" no one plays this game, they will go \" oh sh it, we need to fix this game\" but by then it will be too late!\n\nRiot is in a very lucky position, there is no COMPETITION, if Riot had a competitor besides DOTA2 they would fix this trash of a game up.
