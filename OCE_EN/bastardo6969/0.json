If you have high MMR, then games you win will give you more LP. If you have low MMR, then games you win give you less LP.

It's based off of your MMR. Sometimes, I've had 0lp and lost three games in a row, but I wasn't demoted due to my abnormally high MMR. It's not a definitely rule.\n\nI for one know that a promo can actually increase your division by two ranks instead of one.","replies":[]}]}]}]}
