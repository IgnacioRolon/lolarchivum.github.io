What i would do is double click the league icon and Userkernel would pop up on the dock then immediately disappear, LoLLauncher would follow suit, then LolPatcherUx would appear for about 10 seconds (the icon not the patcher) and then just disappear.\n\nI&#039;ve tried countless solutions but none of them have been working for me... I eventually resorted to uninstalling LoL and reinstalling but after downloading league installer for OCE I got the exact same problem, i went into the file itself and found the LolPatcherUx icon with a grey circle with a bar across it and it said:\n\n &quot;You can&rsquo;t open the application &ldquo;LoLPatcherUx.app&rdquo; because it may be damaged or incomplete.&quot;\n\n WHAT?! please if anyone has had this problem or think they know a fix to it feel free to comment...\n\n{{item:3070}} {{item:3070}} {{item:3070}}","replies":[{"poster":"SephirothSG","date":"2016-01-20T01:16:43.191+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey there,\n\nHave you attempted all the fixes outlined on the [Patching Issues](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/202969434-Patching-Issues#section-mac) KB article?\nFrom what I can gather a lot of users are having success with [booting into safe mode](https://support.apple.com/kb/PH21875?locale=en_US) and running the patcher. Could you attempt that for me?\n\nIf all else fails, do you have a Time Machine backup from before you upgraded to El Capitan that you could revert to for testing?","replies":[{"poster":"RIMRAMSTYLE","date":"2016-01-21T00:03:44.182+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I've tried everything on the article but none of them have worked, and booting into safe mode only made my computer lag even more for some reason without any change to my problem.\n\nMy Time Machine won't open for some reason saying it couldn't load the Time Machine pane but i don't think i had a backup of it anyways... ill keep looking for other possible fixes, ty for the help though ^^","replies":[]}]}]}
