Plus, jungle has many more steamroller champions than mid lane, that just blatantly cant be stopped \nonce they get going.\n\nAlso jungle has the most variety in roles, ADC and Mid laners cant offer much in champion select. ADCs can choose to be long range or short range, and Mid lane can choose to be AD or AP, but thats about it. \n\nJungle can bring so much more to the table, they can be: Tank, AD tank, AP tank, AP bruiser, AD bruiser, Ranged AD, Ranged AP, Melee AD, Melee AP, Support (hello Ivern), etc etc. No other lane can do that except top _(even then, they dont have much freedom becasue unlike jungle, there is more of an emphasis on counter-picking)_, and in most games the top laner doesn't even do anything until 25+ mins anyway.","replies":[{"poster":"FatedSaviour","date":"2017-01-13T09:39:18.114+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"whats the difference between ap tank and ap bruiser...","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"FatedSaviour","date":"2017-01-13T09:37:54.772+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"(from the experience of a should be S5 during S5) each champion serves their own role of importance, with the support trying to enhance the power of the adc, the adc doing dmg effective against tanks and fighters, mid laners having burst wether they be an assasin or mage bieng able to cut down those whose engage and the marksman with burst and cc, the top laner bieng tanky or a fighter, usually one that has hard engage power with cc, or peel from the skillshot champs via peeling, and the jungler has the ability to turn bad lanes around, and turn a good lane into a fed one, as a lot of people are saying, jungle is most important when ahead, if played right, support is, in cases of viktor and yasuo getting fed and roaming, mid lane can become most important, especially if the jungler is behind, top lane i find becomes the most important the least, the only times they become most important is with pushing champs or 1v3 champs like yorick, illaoi, darius or nasus, the toplane can become a giant focus of aggro, or if aggro is not taken, a few towers and a lot of gold, this is especially important with yorick and nasus, as yorick when ahead of powerful, and nasus with free farm is god","replies":[]},{"poster":"chichun2002","date":"2017-01-06T12:20:16.119+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Support because if your support sucks than ur adc and rest of the team will die","replies":[]},{"poster":"Roguestoney","date":"2017-01-05T05:52:13.984+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Support hands down.

Assuming the rest of your team is average a good jungler can mean the difference between a fed team and a feeding team. Supports have a similar impact, but it is usually limited to bot and mid lanes, whereas jungle can impact everywhere.\n\nThat said, it also depends on what role the jungle is playing. If the jng is full damage but the top laner is bruiser frontline then you could argue that top laner is more important in the long run. Or if the enemy team is tank heavy and your support is the only one with peel for the ADC to shred said tanks then you could argue that the support is the most important.\n\nAs a general rule though, jungle has the highest impact potential on any given game, so I'd say they are the most important unless they are going full dmg, in which case I'd say support.","replies":[]}]}
