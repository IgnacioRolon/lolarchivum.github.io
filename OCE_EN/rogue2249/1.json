It&#039;s not about skill anymore, especially in an Oce server. It&#039;s whether or not you get a troll. I&#039;m frankly tired of it because riot doesn&#039;t do anything about it at all. The say people are punished and yet, they get a 10 game chat ban for running it down mid and trolling the team. Honestly i&#039;m just tired of league, time for me to uninstall and remember the old days where climbing to plat was easy...","replies":[{"poster":"DawgnTheBoys","date":"2016-12-03T14:42:59.650+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Alrite I'm sick of you guys complaining its not riots fault at all, if u have a troll laugh it off move on, your more likely to have a troll on the other team so just take it if you can carry you will the next game.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Ing√©nue","date":"2016-12-03T17:13:40.694+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Int feeders don't get chat banned, they get ban banned. The first offence is automatically a 2 week ban. Only toxic chat gets chat restrictions, just like AFKs get leaver busted. The punishment fits the crime. \n\nThe issue here being that a lot of players can't tell between sucking at the game and intentionally feeding. This usually results in players going crazy with the report button, and the \"/all report x for feed\" causing your report weighting to go down. Of course there are instant detection systems for int feeding, but reports really do help for those that don't buy 6x boots. Gotta keep report accuracy up. ","replies":[]}]}
