Many players, excluding those who&#039;re new to the game, generally, adhere extremely to the overall meta of top, jungle, mid, ADC and support. Actually, this game is too meta orientated. This heavily restricts gameplay. Apparently, so many players play to win. It&#039;s unfortunate that they enter Normal games with this mindset. Why Normal games? So many of them have their accounts at level 30. Why don&#039;t they play Ranked games instead if they&#039;re so focused on winning and following the meta? If I&#039;m to have fun in this game, I&#039;ll be locking in any champion I so desire and going anywhere I please. The problem here is that other players will likely rage at me because there is a champion somewhere where they think shouldn&#039;t be there. I don&#039;t think there was a meta before professional play entered the scene. I just wish the players who are so focused on winning the game instead of having fun, or if their fun is derived from winning many matches, stay away from playing Normal games and play Ranked games instead.  There are still many players that play Normal games with this potentially toxic mindset. A mindset toxic to the casual atmosphere of a Normal game.\r\n\r\nIn Normal Blind Pick champion select, is it intended that players comment &quot;top&quot;, &quot;mid&quot;, &quot;adc&quot;, &quot;supp&quot; or &quot;jg&quot; in the chat the moment they get the chance? Fights happen when multiple players call the same role. It seems that these players are stuck in the mindset that LoL is to be played in one way: the meta way. Frankly, I hate that. Admittedly, I&#039;ve called roles in most of the Normal games I&#039;ve played, if not nearly all of them since I started playing the game and started becoming aware that these meta roles existed. I just don&#039;t think that LoL should be restricted to this gameplay. I think Normal Team Builder is a good addition to the game that at least takes away the need to call roles in the champion select screen.\r\n\r\nWhat thoughts about the presence of this mindset in the game do you have?","replies":[{"poster":"Legends man1","date":"2015-06-26T06:24:47.809+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I don't think people should mind if you picked an off meta pick for a lane. It's fine as long you know what you're doing and you don't feed the enemy team. You might be chilling but some people play normals to really practice for ranked. \nIf I was really trying my best to get better, i'd hate it if you picked something like janna jungle or nunu adc because I know these champions doesn't have a good times in these roles and you're most likely going to feed or be useless. If you want to freely do these unorthodox things, then seriously find a bunch of other guys who like the idea and do it ! Who knows dude you might just create a new meta","replies":[]},{"poster":"LUPIN lll","date":"2015-06-26T02:50:15.304+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Normies is fun to fuck around in and so silly experiments.

Yes it is heavily dictated by the pros what is frequently played in what role, but champions will always have the \"lane they were intended to play in (Take Janna for example, back when she was an OP mid pick)\" and people will play their favourite champions like that.\n\nAs much as I hate to admit it I would like to say that I do prefer that my efforts contribute to something. As long as it isn't a total stomp I don't mind of I lose because good games are like that; fun. I think people display this play-to-win attitude because everybody hates having their efforts and time wasted by being defeated, because lets be honest, it sucks to lose when you tried your best. This anger/frustration can also be contributed to by people that they don't think are trying their best by picking \"troll\" champions for \"troll\" roles, or otherwise refusing to play purely for the victory because then they feel that they are going to lose no matter how much effort they use to try and win.\n\nI think that this mindset is viable and completely understandable. People don't play on ranked because as much as they want to win, they are in doubt that their skills would carry them far, plus the many stories of \"Elo hell\" that the bronze players post here scare them into just playing normals. Like me for example. I don't have anywhere near the skill level to play ranked, plus I want a couple of champions that I feel great playing.\n\nI suggest that you play with friends that you know in real life with Skype or something to let you talk to them. It creates a less serious atmosphere that is perfect to play in. Even if you go bad or lose massively then you just shake it off because you are hanging out with your mates rather than in a solitary grind mode.\n\nJust my thoughts and that last thing I think everyone should try, because trust me it is way better to play league with friends.","replies":[]},{"poster":"McRuthless","date":"2015-06-25T22:58:01.049+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"The meta positions have evolved since thats generally the most effective way of playing, especially if youre team is not all coordinated around some other strategy. Most people wont have much fun if they are getting completely crushed and are unable to do anything without dying by 10 or 20 minutes into the game. Play random stuff if you want, but you shouldn't be annoyed that other people are trying their best to win. If you want more casual games, find other people with a similar attitude to you and play custom games instead of normals","replies":[]},{"poster":"DrkResurrection","date":"2016-05-03T00:54:12.025+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"To be very honest, Competitive-spirited players or not, The fact still remains that LoL Players should not take normal PVP games very seriously and it waste of time. Win or lose, it's just a game and they don't get anything out of it apart from chests, keys and IP. \n\nIf they do care about winning, They should be playing ranked games instead and then they can complain as much as they want if they were losing which every LoL player can understand. \n\nNo one would never understand how some players would chat so much gibberish about losing or getting frustrated on a normal PVP game. That's just being stupid. Regardless whether they were AFK or Trolling, Some players have won before with that kind of disadvantage and some people who play a lot should realise by now that it shouldn't be a problem. (P.S. I have won a Normal PVP in a 4v5 situtation, that was the best game i had)","replies":[]},{"poster":"GigaPube","date":"2015-06-25T23:49:13.769+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":3,"body":"if you wanna play duo jungle/roaming support/etc games please find other people to organise that with. i hate having scrubs coming into the only game mode i play on here thinking they can fuck around do whatever they want soraka jungle yolo gg 2ez just because it isnt ranked. you should be playing to win, if you dont care about that then you're trolling and/or feeding and you should gtfo. if you're practicing a champ thats what fucking bots are for dont drag the rest of your team down and not surrender later on only to still lose the game at 40 minutes having wasted 20 minutes more of my life than you should have. you're not complaining about the meta, you're complaining that you want to play soraka jungle, which is, again, what bots are for. little tip though, things like soraka and twitch jungle you might wanna try in custom by yourself first to see if you need a build that is ALL about helping you jungle","replies":[{"poster":"Draggoon Physz","date":"2015-06-26T01:15:02.703+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Why should I be playing to win?

If you don't have fun playing LoL and just play to win, then why are you wasting your time on something you don't enjoy? Practicing for tournaments? You seem to be a competitively-spirited player. Why don't you play Ranked matches instead of Normal matches?
