Rito, could you explain what is causing the lag?\r\n\r\nIf I do not lag, someone in team lags and leaves.\r\nAnd it takes ages to recover or never.\r\nHave lost quite a few games recently because of the lag.\r\nGuess lol is not the game for fun anymore.\r\n\r\nNow I regret I bought the new project skins...\r\n\r\nAnd I am not even sure which board to put this...\r\nDoes rito even know about this crazy issue?","replies":[{"poster":"KagamiArata","date":"2015-09-22T13:07:12.061+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I get that problem quite a lot too.
