Also consider their jungler.\n\n* Try to improve your map awareness. CS-Lookatmap-CS-lookatmap, etc. Guess where their jungler is.\n\n* Don't fight a fed opponent (Sun Tzu: \"Don't fight a stronger enemy\"), unless you are sure their spells are on cooldown and none of their teammates are nearby. This comes with experience. And fed = their level+their items they have in inventory. Check this with TAB.\n\n* Also use TAB in-game to see what they are building. Try to itemise correctly against them and their team. For example if you are a top lane tank and they have a Garen + Jarvan jungler, you'll be buying armour items.\n\n* If behind, focus on farming only. Remember that farm gives you experience and therefore levels, and the higher your level in game, the more damage you do.\n\n* Don't forget to buy a control ward, very useful to see if someone is coming or not. Find a good moment to place it.\n\nJust a few basic tips. Good luck!","replies":[{"poster":"yellowGangsta","date":"2018-07-15T07:23:36.420+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":" Whenever i die, I always go to place a deep ward just in case I die again to the jungler.
