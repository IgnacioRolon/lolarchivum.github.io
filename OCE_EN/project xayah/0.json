I loved these kinda games back in the old Warcraft 3 custom map days.\n\nYou can read more about butchers bridge here - http://nexus.leagueoflegends.com/2017/02/ask-riot-where-is-butchers-bridge/\n**\nAre you guys ever going to bring back the Butcher’s Bridge ARAM map?**\n\nThis one is a bit more complex than it seems at first glance. It might look like just an asset swap for the art (take one thing out, drop another thing in), but there’s actually some underlying level scripts, foundation work, etc. that was forked from regular ARAM. This means that Butcher’s Bridge is a unique beast from the code’s point-of-view, even if it looks the same from a player point-of-view.\nBringing it to parity with today’s ARAM (allowing it to be switched on) would require a non-trivial amount of work, and while we’d love to do that, we have to weigh it against the other stuff we’re currently working on, like new game modes and Practice Tool. This isn’t to say Butcher’s Bridge will never return, just that we’re currently more focused on other development priorities.","replies":[{"poster":"Lord Sesshomaru","date":"2017-08-11T03:06:37.613+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I agree that the Star Guardian map will be a lot more fun than just a retextured ARAM map. A PvE game is what so many players have been asking for for a long time. \nAnd I'm dying to try it!\n\nBut Im also not fully sold on Riot's answer to Butcher's Bridge.\nI feel like if an entire team put in months and months of work into creating it, theres absolutely no chance that **none of them** at all even considered that it might need to be put back into the game at some point, and so didn't bother making any preparations for that.\n\nIt's like spending all your money on a brand new car, but just letting it sit in the garage where no one can enjoy it, just because you can't be bothered to walk down the road and get petrol for it. \n\nIts all very well creating new content, and so ignoring the old stuff, but thats the same argument as \"we only give a champ a skin, if it fits the theme.\" all you end up with is the same champion (like Ezreal, who is so plain that he can fit nearly any theme) getting all the skins. and other champs who have a more specific theme getting none, because none of the existing skin lines work for them, and any new skin lines would only work for them and no other champ, so it's not worth making.\n\nThe same will happen with Butchers Bridge, Riot will always be making new content, and so the _\"we are focused on making new stuff\"_ argument will always apply, and so by the logic, the Bridge will never see the light of day again.\n\nThink of Butchers Bridge like URF. URF isn't new content, however people still prefer it to whatever new game modes come out.\nJust because something isn't new and shiny, doesn't mean it isn't worth the \neffort to restore it.","replies":[]},{"poster":"TheHobbits","date":"2017-08-11T02:28:22.294+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"But what I don't understand is how will the Star Guardian maps and modes differ from the Butchers Bridge? If it is a technical nightmare to add the ARAM map to rotation then how much more difficult would it be to add whole extended SG modes?\n\nOr does it ultimatly come down to Riot saying \"We'll get around to it one day, but right now look at this new dooby!\"\n\nI feel like I want to start a petition poll, but fear that it will just get downvoted into oblivion and buried in a matter of minutes like all my constructive posts.","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Lord Sesshomaru","date":"2017-08-09T02:09:26.649+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"This.... was unexpected.\n\nand very welcome!\nA little disappointed that the 'final boss' isn't Veigar.
