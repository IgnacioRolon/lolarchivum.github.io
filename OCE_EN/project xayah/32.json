It&#039;s not that I take issue with anyone enjoying it, but I just don&#039;t understand the &quot;how&quot; and &quot;why&quot; of it. As a result of that attitude, I often find ESports based content in games (LoL particularly) to be somewhat &quot;intrusive&quot; on my experience and enjoyment of the game. It just feels like the whole idea of ESports is being *forced* into it all.\r\n\r\nThat said, I&#039;ve got to be honest when I say that the SSG skins for Xayah and Rakan actually look really cool, and the whole &quot;set&quot; of the SSG skins seem to be the first that don&#039;t have this whole &quot;shoving ESports in you face&quot; kind of feel, and having read through the latest Ask Riot, which addressed how these ESports skins are chosen and created, it seems like Riot might be moving in a direction that allows *more* players to enjoy these skins without being fans of the ESports side of things.","replies":[{"poster":"Lord Sesshomaru","date":"2018-06-29T04:58:18.030+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"What?!!?\nYou mean to say you don't enjoy trawling through thousands and thousands of random logo summoner icons that you know absolutely nothing about and care even less for. Just to reach the one actual Karthus icon you want, thats hidden somewhere at the bottom of the page?\n\n**Cos thats my favourite part! :D**\n\nOhhh and when you want to use the _'random summoner icon'_ thing, and you have to wait for one of the 6 days a year where there isn't absolutely megatons of random LCSOPLALLSTARS etc etc. icons. _(i think they might be excluded now, but it wasn't always so)_.\n\nNot to mention having pimply faced teenagers sprawled all over the login screen and front page 70% of the time. Its not like one of the reasons we play fantasy games is to get immersed into the 'fantasy' element or anything! :D\n\nIm so glad that _whatever_ pro, is really good at CSing, or mid laning, etc. thats great! Im happy for them, but please don't slap his face onto the font page every couple of weeks. I come here to become a gold sand god-emperor and bring the might of shurima to bare against my enemies. Not to be shown continuously that there are people who are much better at micro managing creep-score-per-minute than me! That doesn't ruin the fantasy element at all :D\n\n_________________________\n\n\nAll that being said, I am looking forward to the only Taliyah skin to have ever been released :P\nIt's not bad considering ^^\n\nDespite being hard out e-sports ish, I did really like the first set of team skins, (TPA), because it was neat to see champs who are usually covered in spiky armour etc, in hoodies with headphones and sneakers, they were so out of their element it actually make for an almost humours skin line. But after the TPA skins, the rest of the team skins series weren't quite 'regular person' enough to have that same _\"Oh cool its the god of the dead, texting on his iPhone\"_ kind of effect, but also weren't fantastical enough to be normal skins. They were just in this limbo vibe of _\"if you follow the pros, you'll prolly know what this skin is about\"._ \nBut these latest SSG ones are towards the fantasy end, so much so that they could just be regular skins, and enjoyed as such. But still have a flair of _\"congrats this is the team that won\"_ feel. \n\nOverall, gj on the SSG skins Riot!","replies":[{"poster":"Cortez","date":"2018-06-30T09:24:38.384+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hello taliyah already has a skin...","replies":[{"poster":"Lord Sesshomaru","date":"2018-06-30T23:49:32.334+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yea, HeartVine and Seras Dragon have pretty much summed it up.\n\nAll champs get a release skin, (so its kinda like if everyone has it, no one does).\nSo this is the first skin Taliyah has ever got where Riot have consciously made the decision to give her a skin _(and even then, SSG forced their hand a little)_.\n\nMuch like how Arclight Yorick was actually the first new Yorick skin to ever be released.\nYes he still had skins before it, but he had never gotten a new skin since the day of his release.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Project Xayah","date":"2018-06-30T09:40:36.210+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The skin Taliyah already has is her release skin, which was available from the moment she was.
