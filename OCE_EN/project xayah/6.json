Add an option to exclude E-Sports content, such as icons and skin lines, from various loot sources, such as Hextech Chests and certain event related content (like the Orbs of Chaos and Order), for people who just don&#039;t care about anything E-Sports related.\n\nJust spent 140 of my hard earned Chaos Tokens and got, get this, SKT T1 Azir, which, not including the fact I don&#039;t like Azir that much, is just plain useless to me, since I genuinely don&#039;t care about E-Sports or the teams that partake. Exceedingly disappointing and frustrating loot to for me to get, and I&#039;m sure many others would agree.\n\nEDIT: Just spent *another* 140 and got *another* SKT T1 skin, this time for Alistar... Thanks, Rito...","replies":[{"poster":"CHEESYLEEKS","date":"2017-06-30T05:55:45.692+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Theres just to many skt skins its fucking annoying.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Aidan7787","date":"2017-06-29T12:46:42.563+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It is a luck based RNG system, that riot has given out for free.
