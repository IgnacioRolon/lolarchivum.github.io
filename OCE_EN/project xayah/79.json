Simply, enemies hit by Rupture would be stuck airborne, unable to do anything, for about a second longer than they should have been. I've only noticed this in one custom game so if anyone else has noticed this please say so.","replies":[{"poster":"kJs","date":"2015-03-22T16:14:45.954+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I don't think I've experienced that bug. It may be that you're just lagging. Any other details that you could put in? e.g. minions around during cast, effects on the target, other weird way to recreate the bug?","replies":[]}]}
