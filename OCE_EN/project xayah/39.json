Blind pick is, by it&#039;s very nature, a chaotic experience. From the chaos, the community developed the idea of &quot;Call Order&quot;, to make it a little easier on everyone involved.\r\n\r\nCall Order, however, has some pretty obvious flaws. It relies on the cooperation of 5 (more often than not) randomly matched individuals. It is influenced (to whatever small degree) by a given players reflexes, typing speed and internet quality. It is easily abuse-able by those known as &quot;instalockers&quot;. At the end of the day, the champ select experience in Blind Pick games devolves into an argument over who got which position a bit too often.\r\n\r\nWhat I want to propose is that Riot retire Blind Pick in favour of a superior (and less chaotic) champion select experience. Something that will allow all players to jump into a game and not get the impression that it will be an instant loss because &quot;xXJacob360Xx&quot; and &quot;GaryTheFruitcake&quot; argued over who got Mid (*Note: any resemblance to actual players is completely coincidental*).\r\n---\r\nSo, what exactly am I proposing? Well, for now, lets call it &quot;Blind Order&quot; (if you can think of a better name, feel free to suggest it)\r\nHere&#039;s how it works:\r\n\r\n|Team 1|-----|Order for Pick|-----|Team 2|\r\n|-\r\n|Player 1| |First Pick| |Player 6|\r\n|Player 2| |Second Pick| |Player 7|\r\n|Player 3| |Third Pick| |Player 8|\r\n|Player 4| |Forth Pick| |Player 9|\r\n|Player 5| |Fifth Pick| |Player 10|\r\n\r\nNaturally (as with Blind Pick), Team 1 can&#039;t see Team 2&#039;s picks and vice versa. If you&#039;re looking to counterpick, then may the odds be ever in your favour.\r\n---\r\nIt may look fairly simple on the surface, but it doesn&#039;t end there. To give every player a relatively equal opportunity to get first or second pick, they&#039;ll be more likely to be placed as first or second pick the more consecutive games they play as third, forth or fifth pick (similarly to how &quot;autofill protection&quot; works in ranked/draft).\r\n\r\nSo say, for arguments sake, we have 5 people who got randomly matched onto a team. Person 1 was second pick in their last game. Person 2 had first pick 2 games ago. Person 3 has been forth/fifth pick the last 4 games. Person 4 had second pick 2 games ago, and fifth pick last game. Person 5 has been first/second pick in 2 of their last 4 games.\r\n\r\nThe pick order, in this case (and based on the provided information), would go something like: Person 3 &gt; Person 4 &gt; Person 2 &gt; Person 1 &gt; Person 5\r\n---\r\nAdvantages:\r\n- Requires no more available champions to access than Blind Pick (available to everyone).\r\n- No longer impacted by individual reflexes, typing speed and internet connection.\r\n- Keeps true to the &quot;blind&quot; nature of the more casual queue types.\r\n- Ideally reduces toxicity in champion select.\r\nDisadvantages:\r\n- Longer champion select process.\r\n- Wont be easy to convert the system over to a new &quot;standard&quot; pick type (basically, a lot of effort on Riot&#039;s part).\r\n---\r\nIf you want to add to the concept/discussion, think I missed anything or simply want to show your support for a new &quot;standard&quot; champion select experience, make your voice heard!","replies":[{"poster":"Akkordian Zoeve","date":"2017-06-02T21:37:20.568+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"Great idea :D ...even if I only play Ranked xD\n\nAlso, if Riot read this... **NORMAL DRAFT** would be nice in OCE.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Fitzky","date":"2017-06-03T04:28:06.784+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Finally something we can agree on yes I'M DONE WITH ROLE CALLING","replies":[]},{"poster":"Roguestoney","date":"2017-06-03T21:21:03.943+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I agree sparky.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Lord Sesshomaru","date":"2017-06-03T10:01:50.260+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Firstly, congrats on the purple name! ^^\n\nAs for your idea, I think it's pretty solid!\nBlind pick definitely has it's uses, but there is a lot of chaos like you say. and there isn't enough time on the countdown to sort problems out.\nFor example:\n\nPlayer 1: Mid\nPlayer 2: Mid\nPlayer 3: Top\nPlayer 4: ADC\nPlayer 5 Jungle\nPlayer 1: Mid is called \nPlayer 2: No, I called. You joined last.\nPlayer 1: I joined first?\nPlayer 5: Player 1 called dude\nPlayer 4: WHO MAH SUP?!\n[Player 2 lock in]\nPlayer 1: Seriously...\nPlayer 1: I had to support last game too :/\n[Player 1 chooses Soraka]\nPlayer 3: Hey man you go top, ill support, it's fine.\n[Player 3 chooses Tahm Kench]\nPlayer 3: All good?\n[No response, 2 seconds left on timer]\nPlayer 3: Dude?\n[Clock on under 1 second]\n[Player 3 changes back to Darius]\n[Player 1 changes to Nasus]\n[Clock times out]\nPlayer 4: ....\n\nRip game.\n\nThe amount of times I've seen this happen _(and often been part of it)_, and games actually being ruined by niceness rather than instalocking.... xD\nThere isn't enough time on the clock to sort out complex problems, or work around other people.\n\nSo having a system where there is no need for such complex communication is a good idea.\n\nMy only problem with this is that sometimes, it's late at night and you just wanna play one Kindred game before bed. You only really want to play Kindred at this point, and if you new you were not going to get kindred, you would have just watched anime instead.\n\nJungle is a well called position, but not like mid, so you have a 80%+ chance of being first call if you are quick. \nSo most of time time you get to play your game as the champ you want. _(sometimes you miss out and spend 40 mins regretting not just watching anime)_\n\nBut with this system, you have less of a chance at just getting the champs you want _(especially if you have recently already been 1st or 2nd pick)_, when you're tired and just don't have the patience to play a champ you down want to.\nThat'd be my only criticism.\n_(But this is coming from someone with a relatively fast computer, who more often than not does get first call...)_\n\n\nPersonally I just want some bans in normal games.\nI like blind pick, but I'm getting to the point where I don't care anymore, I just want bans. I just want to have a game or two without a Lee riding up my ass, or a Yas spamming his lvl 7 in my face every 30 seconds.\n\nThis is a good Idea though!\nGreat post.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Broken Scripts","date":"2017-06-03T03:28:42.369+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I make a thread on this and get downvoted to hell.\n\nNice community.","replies":[{"poster":"Project Xayah","date":"2017-06-03T05:19:13.141+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Would you be able to link that thread for me?
