I love themed maps, and just lore-based... anything.. really,  but I'm not holding my breath.","replies":[{"poster":"Nightjar","date":"2017-07-26T14:41:53.662+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"map skins would be amazing, especially with lore themes, but my question is whether we'll get skins for dragon and baron? When will baron be getting a skin? Riot is so focused on making more skins for champs like annie or riven, that baron keeps getting overlooked for a new skin. When will I be able to buy a skin for baron (even if only I can see it)?","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"JesusForgotHisGA","date":"2017-07-26T12:51:13.281+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'm more referring to the map accents shown in the above link. It's still the same summoners rift but with different minions, towers, nexus etc. These really in no way affect the maps vision and what not so I can't see why they wouldn't be up for purchase.\n\nThe white summoners rift is an entire map skin/colour change which isn't what we are talking about here, it's only the accents.\n\nThey have a perfect opportunity to cash on on map accent sales, do you really think they wont' take the opportunity to make more sales? Will surprise me immensely if they don't.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Akkordian Zoeve","date":"2017-07-26T10:16:28.272+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'm so hyped, especially for the skin splashes in the portraits :D","replies":[]},{"poster":"JesusForgotHisGA","date":"2017-07-26T08:05:12.170+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"As if Riot WON'T consider these as skin options that will be up for purchase. It's already  so obvious with the option of people allowing them to turn it off or on.

What I hope to see is that they make map accents for many of their events or themes, like Harrowing, Blood Moon, Pool Party, PROJECT, Snowdown, Lunar Revel, etc that you can turn on at any time and leave on. Heck they already got one for PROJECT if I remember right. I'm sure mods already allow that, but Riot would make real nice looking map accents that you can manage right in the game, could even put a drop down right in the pregame lobby.","replies":[{"poster":"Project Xayah","date":"2017-07-26T07:35:58.054+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It's likely that they're just trying it out exclusively for events at the moment, though I wouldn't expect them to leave it at that. Chances are they'll introduce all the different map accents (once they've \"built up the stocks\", there's likely a few \"map skins\" that would need to be adapted to the client update) as a permanent opt-in option. If anything, I'd expect Riot to treat map accents like champion skins, purchasable for RP in the store (even obtainable in Hextech Crafting) and swap-able in champ select (perhaps even in the profile section).\n\nThe thing to remember with mods, though, is that they're pretty much all banned at this point, even the purely aesthetic ones which weren't previously, so it's not a viable option if you want to actually keep the account.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Canc","date":"2017-07-26T04:36:01.517+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"everything about this pbe update is exciting","replies":[]}]}
