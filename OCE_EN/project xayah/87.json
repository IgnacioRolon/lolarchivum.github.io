Unfortunately I wont be posting the list on the boards, the thread would be closed and I'd get banned (and no one wants that, silly no name and shame policy). I will be sending the list to Riot via support so they can, hopefully, start handing out bans. If you've come across any and want them included contact me in-client. PLEASE DO NOT POST THEIR NAMES IN THIS THREAD. I currently have approximately 130 individuals listed.\n\nThis thread already exists on the forums but thought I may as well have another here for more awareness.
