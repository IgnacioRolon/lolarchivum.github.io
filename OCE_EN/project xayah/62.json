Basically what it does is allow people to purchase the in-game currency (RP in the case of LoL) using gift cards that would otherwise go unused.\r\n**Advantages:**\r\n- Allows people to use gift cards that would otherwise not be used.\r\n- Allows people to get a bit more RP if they have the spare gift cards.\r\n- It's entirely voluntary! Meaning you don't have to use it!\r\n**Disadvantages:**\r\n- Reduced RP rate. This is due to the cards not actually being purposed for Riot. Essentially the company/business the gift card is for would charge a small rate to allow people to purchase in-game currency (RP in LoL) using the card.","replies":[]}
