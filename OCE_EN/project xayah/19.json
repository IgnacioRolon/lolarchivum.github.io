Thanks Riot OCE for trying to help bring back the old community.\n\nAfter seeing the announcement that we will have to pay for our server skin, unlike any other server with their respective server skins, I have decided to take action. I have started a petition, located on [Change.org](https://www.change.org/p/riot-games-riot-let-us-have-the-oce-skin-for-free?recruiter=394058478&amp;utm_source=share_for_starters&amp;utm_medium=copyLink), and fired off a support ticket to Riot in the hopes that the issue might be discussed.\n\nThe fact remains that no one from Riot ever stated that the Pool Party Ziggs skin given out during the beta was a &quot;replacement&quot; for the OCE skin, and that, if we wanted to have the skin that is to represent our server, we would **have** to spend money on Riot Points to purchase it from the in-client store. Help me fight this discrimination against the OCE server and add numbers to the petition.\n\nBack on the [other thread](http://boards.oce.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/miscellaneous/M9oJZRTE-oce-server-skin) there are, currently, the following poll results:\n&quot;Yes&quot; = 50\n&quot;Yes but swap with PP Ziggs&quot; = 15\n&quot;No&quot; = 4\n&quot;Couldn&#039;t care less&quot; = 9","replies":[]}
