To be totally honest I've never played a game that has so many griefers and just plain assholes in it. It's sickening really to think that more times than not I'll either get a griefer on my team or a person who intentionally feeds. And by that I mean someone who runs it down mid , blatantly refuses to assist the team (refuses to ult, heal, exhaust or sits in the jungle the entire game whilst we lose our nexus etc).\n\nUnfortunately Riot sit pretty much idle and do little in response to this kind of behavior. If they had a 0 policy on this type of bullshit I believe the toxicity and verbal abuse would also follow suit and decline. Majority of the time people lash out at these griefers and it's them who cop the chat bans instead of it being the other way around. I've certainly done it and copped chat bans in return.\n\nAnother thing is even when you do report these asswipes nothing appears to happen. You don't get any sort of feedback or anything and they continue to play on. I know for myself if I was in a game with a griefer or intent feeder I wouldn't be so frustrated and wanting to lash out if I knew they had a ban or some form of punishment coming their way after the game. Hell even some sort of feedback saying your report was taken into account and placed against that person for future weighting or something similar. But you get nothing, zip, nada, no feedback, no ban message... nothing. So not only do you lose the LP, waste atleast 20 minutes of your time you don't get any feedback and the other person plays on.\n\nPretty sad but hey? But that's League for you.\n\nYou only have to ask people what they think of League and I'm willing to bet majority of OCE players will tell you it's a toxic cesspit.","replies":[{"poster":"Tevolofox","date":"2017-06-10T11:27:38.645+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"and see i dont have a problem with verbal abuse like if it gets too bad just mute them but when the are actively ruining a game which happens more often than not thats what gets to me","replies":[{"poster":"TheyCallHimTeemo","date":"2017-06-13T04:45:31.472+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Exactly!  You cant physically stop somebody from inting, but you can easily mute somebody stopping them from verbal harassment.  Riot really needs to crack down on inting and griefing, something that actually ruins the game.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Psylock1234","date":"2017-06-12T13:59:59.648+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"r u talking about twitch cos i'm a twitch main don't bully","replies":[]}]}
