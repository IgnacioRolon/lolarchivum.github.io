Everything else will, including Flash. However, if you look at the range of Flash, you'll find that it just *barely* extends past the width of Azir's wall.\n\nNow, you may be thinking, you've flashed over walls nearly twice that size in thickness! It's related to how the game handles when your champion is placed inside terrain. You see, if you Flash into a bit of terrain, the game will find the next piece of free ground to place your champion in, closest to where they were displaced. In essence, if you Flash at least halfway or more through a wall, you'll end up on the other side. The precise coding the game does to achieve this is by rapidly moving your champion from inside the terrain to the ground, usually so fast that it doesn't even appear in-game. This is regarded as **movement**.\n\nIf you Flash so that your champion is inside Azir's wall (which will be the majority of times you attempt to Flash over it, due to Flash's relatively small range) then your champion will attempt to move through the wall, just as if it were normal terrain. But Azir's wall is programmed to knock back anything attempting to \"move\" through the wall in the direction he originally cast the ult in. While it's still possible to use Flash to blink over Azir's wall, it's very hard since if you path your champion into it, they will automatically path *around* it, not allowing you to get as close as you need to be against the wall.\n\ntl dr; You need to be right up against the wall in order to flash over it.\n\nEdit: This might interest you:\nhttp://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/2icovr/list_of_all_abilities_that_can_go_over_azirs/","replies":[]}]}
