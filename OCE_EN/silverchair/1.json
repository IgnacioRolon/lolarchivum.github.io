You have responsibility in every win/loss, focus on learning rather than blaming and you will climb faster.\n\n**Don't blame your teammates** - Now let me preface this point by saying yes there are SOME games that are out of your control but the vast majority are winnable and in your control. Focus on your own gameplay, focus on learning, focus on not tilting, focus on staying positive. This is what will help you improve and climb the ladder.\n\nMy biggest concern with this type of thinking (elo hell/ my team mates hold me back) is how can you take it upon yourself to learn and grow and climb if you attribute everything to others?\n\nThis video is always a great watch to help adjusting your attitude when it comes to ranked.\n\nhttps://youtu.be/5MTO2a7ZFcc","replies":[{"poster":"Silverchair","date":"2015-09-16T04:51:24.133+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"And here, since you shared a video, ill share one too.

I know some challangers will start a game then afk cuz they have too much LP (since it's uncapped).\n\nMy only suggestions are:\n\n- **Duo if you're on tilt with someone skilled, and think about your combo (malph, yas wombo for example).**\n\n- **Be prepared, to play more then just one role, rune / masteries, and for trolls.**\n\n- **Play unconventional things and try getting your duo / team mates to do the same.** For example fizz can be played mid or jungle, but since you cant see summoners in teamselect if you have another person that picks a dual role champion (someone that can top / jungle for example) it becomes much harder for the enemy team to counter pick.\n\n- **I recommend staying away from top lane unless you're duo, reason being dragon control is everything to the early and mid game particularly the 2nd drag with 15% extra dmg to structures.** You can role tele on top lane, but even if you do, you risk losing lane for no rewards if they manage to take drag anyway. At least being mid / jungle / bot you're close enough to take / contest easily and provided you get drag even if you die there should be a few others left to clean up / defend lane if it's pushed.\n\n- **Know OP wombos / buffed champs / counters. At the moment thanks to the patches we can rebrand this game league of tanks.** I dont mean hit up lolcounter every time you go in for ranked i mean literally know who you want to play and who you can go in and stomp lane against. For example i know that when i play fizz im weak against brand. Perhaps it's the way i play, or whatever, but the fact i know it means im not going to blindly push lane and have him freeze it on me and i can max E first instead of my usual Q to help with farming under tower / dodging dmg. It'll also help you in banning, knowing is half the battle.\n\n- **Treat every minion like it's your last** myself and most other people i know can beat bronze's just by outfarming them / knowing what gives them waveclear.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Crepr","date":"2015-09-09T22:42:12.949+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Even in a 4 vs 5 situation u can still win,  just focus on the game and dont let negative or afk people tilt ya. {{item:3361}} {{item:2049}} {{item:2043}}","replies":[]},{"poster":"McRuthless","date":"2015-09-08T13:41:11.466+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I guarantee you, there are just as many games where the afks, trolls, people arguing with each other, whatever, are on the enemy team and are giving you free wins, even if you're biased and probably don't see it yourself. It evens out. The only person you control is you. Stop getting caught up with the games where your teammate is afk for half the game or some guy is running down mid lane feeding, these aren't the games you need to carry. Neither are the ones where an enemy is afk or your whole team is stomping so hard you can't lose. Focus on making the difference in the close games, the ones where YOUR performance is the difference between winning and losing. Even if these only come once every 5 or 10 games, you turn all those close games into wins and suddenly your gunna have a 60% winrate and be climbing like crazy.","replies":[]},{"poster":"TeCoolMage","date":"2015-09-08T13:21:48.692+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Create a ranked 5 team either by searching around online or attempting to create a LoL cult in your community.","replies":[]},{"poster":"JasonWazza","date":"2015-09-08T12:42:13.415+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Just as a note, don't let your league get you down, your league, LP etc mean nothing, what matters is your MMR, focus on your play and you will get better.\n\nEDIT: What i mean by focus on your play is, if your mid and the mid laner roamed bot, counter their roam and roam with them, that is something you can do, if their jungle is ganking, counter-gank.\n\nThis sort of thing also reduces arguing in general because there is less to complain about.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Lord Sesshomaru","date":"2015-09-08T10:38:49.929+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I know exactly how you're feeling, I'm trying to get out of bronze too, and my main weapon is trying to keep everyone positive, i cant give any advice because i haven't got there yet but i know my downfall is that every time i lose a ranked i think \"right ill cut my losses for today and play norms\" and every time i win i think \"right that was good lets leave it there before i undo what i just did.\" and that means i don't play much ranked at all xD so i think just sheer volume of games helps, even if you have a 50/50 win rate apparently you still move up slowly, so in that case the more games the better. \n\nit really sucks when people squabble and miss opportunities because of that etc, it really comes down to luck wether you get some rager afk or a diamond smurf helping his friend out of bronze on your team, but yea like i said i cant give any advice on something i haven't done yet but you're not alone :)","replies":[]},{"poster":"Talon12","date":"2015-09-08T11:13:24.233+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Regardless of what people say, yasuo is hard to use well, if you can't use him well, thats going to be a constant demote, but if you learn to use him well, and utilize his abilities at the right moment, he can help you climb really well.\n\nIf you know how to use him well, you can turn the tides of a 4v5 in your favour. **But only if you know how how use him well**","replies":[]}]}
