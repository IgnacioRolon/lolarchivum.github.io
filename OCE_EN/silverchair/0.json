But for a different reason","subforum":"Miscellaneous","up_votes":2,"down_votes":2,"body":"I have played this game since the beginning, And i&#039;ve seen the ups and downs of the league.\r\n\r\nI&#039;m very stressed out because Shen is being reworked, and i&#039;m ripping my hair out because Shen is the only part of the game that i truly enjoy.\r\n\r\nPeople claimed he was useless , saying half his kit was useless and he doesn&#039;t match up to champions like Fiora or Riven etc\r\nBut the problem isn&#039;t Shen. it is the people who are playing him very wrong.\r\n\r\nIve played Shen since he was released, and i have amazed people with the way i play Shen, proving he is a very viable champion.\r\n\r\nTypical Shen scenario:\r\n\r\nShen uses stand united, Shen then uses shadow dash. The enemy then says, meh its just Shen and they leave him till last and deal with him after they have killed every one else.\r\n\r\nThe reason this happens, is because people build Shen like this{{item:3111}} {{item:3068}} {{item:3065}} {{item:3083}} {{item:3075}} {{item:3078}} \r\n\r\nAnd it doesn&#039;t work. it really doesn&#039;t.\r\n\r\nWhy?\r\n\r\nBecause Shen is not a full tank. He isn&#039;t your typical tank, He is a fighter/bruiser who plays out as an assassin, he is a very flexible character\r\n\r\nThis is how i play Shen. {{champion:98}} \r\n\r\nBuild:{{item:1300}} {{item:3748}} {{item:3153}} {{item:3143}} {{item:3091}} {{item:3742}}  Sometimes a {{item:3156}}  if the team is very heavy ap.\r\n\r\nMy runes: \r\n3x Greater Quintessence of Energy Regeneration.\r\n9x Greater mark of attack speed.\r\n9x Greater seal of armor.\r\n9x Greater Glyph of magic resist\r\n\r\nIn total that grants\r\n\r\n15.28% Attack Speed\r\n+9 Armor\r\n+12.06 Magic resist\r\n+4.7 Energy regen/5\r\n\r\nMasteries: \r\n18/0/12\r\nFEROCITY:                                                                                   RESOLVE:\r\nFury                                                                                              Unyielding\r\nDouble edged sword                                                                  Tough Skin\r\nnatural talent                                                                              Veterans Scars \r\noppressor                                                                                    Insight\r\nbattering blows\r\ndeathfire touch\r\n\r\nSummoner Spells: Ignite / Ghost\r\n\r\nExplanation of his kit.\r\n\r\nKi Strike is a symbolic ability of Shen. the sound of his ki strike being ready, the glowing of the hands, top it off with a titanic hydra and even a dead mans plate and it will cause massive damage. Using the titanic hydras active ability immediately after using ki strike will cause an auto attack reset which deals incredible damage and shaves off the cooldown on ki strike.\r\n\r\nVorpal blade is another symbolic ability of Shen, with a low cooldown, it provides a life tap that allows you to sustain yourself while dealing serious damage.\r\nThis is a very important dueling ability and can be used defensively and offensively.\r\n\r\nFeint is the ability most questioned. People say its useless since its a small shield... But is it useless? No. Far from it.\r\nIn fact its very different from most shields in the game. its not a shield that you can pop and say look at me im tough and dont take any damge (looking at you {{champion:111}}  :P ) In fact feint is a situational shield, it is useful for avoiding something serious at the precise time.\r\nAnd heres the interesting part. Its all part of his strong trading phase.\r\n\r\nShadow dash, follow up with vorpal blade attack with ki strike which engages the heal, on top of that you are taking 50% reduced damage , and you have feint on top of that. suddenly that little shield isnt so useless after all.\r\nIt can also be used at the right time to shave off a few seconds of Ki strike.\r\n\r\nStand united, either used to save someones life, or to bring an unstoppable gank. Communication is everything with this ability, Many times i tell my adc to walk into the brush, i teleport to him and then jump out, and surprise the enemy. Or use it on top of a {{champion:54}}  Ult (ouch!)\r\n\r\nUsing this setup will allow you to be very durable , and still benefit from low cooldown, the energy regen is very helpful and allows you to always be able to use whatever ability you need.\r\nThe damage you will deal is absolutely incredible.\r\n\r\nBut heres the fun part. what lane do i use this setup in? believe it or not.. Middle lane!\r\n\r\nShens abilities are perfect for mid, and they are great against the usual mid laners, Shen counters just about any champion if played right.\r\n(Example, Shen counters Yasuo extremely well, Shadow dash through yasuo which will pop yasuos passive shield, follow up with vorpal blade and ki strike and pop feint to avoid the damage due to 50% damage reduction from shadow dash and more with the shield.\r\nShen also counters Zed,Leblanc,Ekko,Kassadin,Veigar,Azir and just about anyone else you can think of.\r\n\r\nIts important to note that vorpal blade is weak on rank one, but as soon as you hit rank 2, you&#039;re good to go, that gives you plenty of time to focus on last hitting minions with vorpal blade and ki strike before being offensive and jumping your opponent. \r\n\r\nYou will be able to jump the back line of a team fight and kill the adc before your taunt even wears off. Yes you will do that much damage.\r\n\r\nYou will topple champions like Fiora, riven,Olaf, anyone who hits really hard, you will hit harder and outlast them. you will inflict huge damage in team fights. \r\n\r\nI have played Shen since his release, and ive bonded  with him, he is my favourite champion, in fact he is one of my all time favourite video game characters. and i cringe whenever i see someone playing him wrong then saying how bad he is, simply because they are playing him wrong.\r\n\r\nShen suffers from misunderstanding more then anything. And surprisingly enough he has a fair learning curve.\r\n\r\nBut please try the above. I have many screenshots and video of my gameplay as Shen. Including pentakills and everything.\r\n\r\nI have played this game for so long, i have seen things go up and down, and the community has sadly become very horrible i suffer from severe depression and have even been reduced to tears from some of the hurtful things people can say, and even though riot has done a great job trying to clean up the community and make it a happy and friendly place, it still has a long way to go.Lately there have been changes that i havent yet decided whether i like them or not, Some changes have severely affected my gameplay. But the entire time ive played this game i have always said to my friends, as long as i can play shen the way i always have throughout the years, im happy, but if he ever gets changed into something that i dont like i will most likely leave the game for good.\r\n\r\nLately ive been super stressed about this rework, i have  seen some of the changes made to the game and im very scared what could happen to shen.\r\n\r\nI have been playing games worse lately because im so scared of what is going to happen to Shen, and i may end up Leaving this game for good if he is changed so much that i cant play him the same way. And it may sound silly, but i would actually be very heartbroken.\r\n\r\nThankyou to everyone that has taken the time to read what i wrote, i dont know if this will spark positive or negative feedback, but i just felt the need to speak my mind and express myself, and i do feel a little relieved having done so.\r\n\r\nI do hope you all have fun with the snowdown event :) and i hope you have positive games and a very merry christmas!","replies":[{"poster":"Miss Kibbles","date":"2015-12-12T08:08:43.934+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Totally agree with you, they need to leave shen alone because he is a champion that is misunderstood.

Otherwise she blows up easily and you can't utilize her kit effectively, then Zhonya's 9 times out of ten or ludens for hunting people down or deathcap if you're stupidly fed but the stats of the other two items are almost always superior on her because of her kit compared to the flat AP.\n\nHotshot still goes her top lane though with Iceborn rush, now that iceborn doesn't give AP it's less favourable but she's a monster top lane still regardless. Plus the hybrid masteries help her a lot (Precision) and with the nerfs to ADs with armor pen, being a hybrid that favors AP but still has a bit of physical damage and having a mastery that suits your kit perfectly she's still good IMO. She smashes lee also and he's in like every game.\n\n(His runes are the standard too because you get faster clears with the AD as magic pen doesnt help clears and overall the scaling to her Q and the auto damage end up being better since you can clear faster then gank, than magic pen does).\n\nEdit: Just played her, Seems fine dude:\n\nhttps://lh3.googleusercontent.com/ge_7rYAY2QwPu7YDOF1vA1Z9w0rOWgBUVaotoDOB2SGOcfhB2ltMTHVfTUGE22k_Rr2JlhnKB_3ygr0bZH1VyqZv1-2nS4qoWmvns5pw4dD_osdzDq8X0iaTYsyY57p4j4rB8s6rLPai5IcIIXI0GxFYIujeU41zIqeHd9_Ur2-xgs_zhhepCw0aWDT6SOAes0cqejlPE2oP8inJlbOkdjdFHp-jBJzkQOqo-tSed-q16X0unFwCwo8aRWblbJmrbFj3YWS8cEHkC9UQ2cy5ZO-kAU995PTy_rQ3zrgFsL6SzFF4s93T6TmL2CtsnMkwe9I1rqpRfRyr2xIs1fEHwmLRI9MGKI2upeR9TgUJN66Xp0DOtrSr2LxiYUU2wMdRAJWEkV5yJjozuZtiyrsemyOpO5r92hPo0C9EzXeWWLD-s9nkQZY8GdlWjo-MMJSy58FXJmj-D095GaDMDS0gbTdy8TQa3rgKfzpPG67gB_oEBuVRQQ16tLKyRkEirC03wcwzHvs5fOD5VY3zYI3PEUU6SoTOX5QXf-s5Yj3MOj-lW5_plAflhoPDBF2JXhnsucl9=w1029-h643-no","replies":[{"poster":"JasonWazza","date":"2015-12-14T02:49:45.501+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"She's fine, but she's reliant on the enemy comp over your own, that and i personally haven't been the best jungle nidalee (i understand how it works on paper and can't execute it properly.)\n\nAlso if your team in anyway falls behind she's not all that good.\n\nAnd she is a champ in jungle that if you invade her on her first clear, your likely to screw her for the entire game.\n\nPost rework nid IS amazing, the problem is they did end up gutting her fairly hard.","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Bambooze","date":"2015-12-12T00:13:48.416+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You're looking at a new Shen main.
