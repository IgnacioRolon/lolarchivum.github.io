To compare a 3/5 would be like brand/lux. 4/5 would be like a cassiopia/zoe. 5/5 would be azir/ryze.\n\nAll you need to remember is that you don't always have to teleport to your e and to save your w to secure kills or run away. Q for dps or poke. R for kill combo or as a Zhonyas.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"LevvyLeviticus","date":"2018-04-04T23:25:51.312+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Jax is definitely a good top laner that has health, damage and can take down a MF. Jax only costs 1350 BE, which means he's relatively cheap. I would ask you to look into his abilities though, as the way he counters MF is his E ability. Take TP and flash on him top, and i'd suggest bringing triforce and another damage item, then building titanic hydra and build tanky after that. Best of luck on the rift! :)","replies":[{"poster":"Socon","date":"2018-04-06T06:09:29.342+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Dont play jax mid.","replies":[]}]}]}
