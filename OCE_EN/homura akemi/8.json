All 1350 would have done to that skin is add a different voice/lines.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Homura Akemi","date":"2014-11-20T09:24:48.719+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"gtfo. {{champion:90}} <3","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Nature","date":"2014-11-20T08:26:09.205+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Free rp pls.

Out of the Snowdown skins for this year, Sejuani is the only interesting one, but still probably won't buy. I was expecting a Zac or Vel'Koz skin.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Niji","date":"2014-11-20T00:47:30.987+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Rip wallets everywhere.","replies":[]},{"poster":"P1 GTR","date":"2014-11-20T00:04:30.717+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"wtf link pls","replies":[]},{"poster":"P1 GTR","date":"2014-11-20T00:03:51.666+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"wtf link pls","replies":[]}]}
