I had lots of problems on my first few rounds on non-heavy sustain junglers D:\n\nA useful thing to remember is the Smite buffs that can help you sustain on the first round -  smiting the Red Buff gives you straight HP and smiting Krug gives you a stun on monsters on hit, which is a pretty massive help too. It's also likely that you don't want to save your smite for the final hit on some of these - you can use their smite buff to beat them (and you'll get it back up sooner)!","replies":[{"poster":"Homura Akemi","date":"2014-11-22T00:49:29.882+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"yea dude, i like the monster buffs that you get but the first 5 levels is almost impossible for me to gank lanes (due to the fact i only get 2 health pots and i have no sustain) which is frustrating because \ni've always played gank heavy champions like vi and i hate clearing jungle until i am healthy enough to influence lanes","replies":[{"poster":"Zaps","date":"2014-11-22T01:35:05.637+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yeah, I think the big change is that a lot of S4 Gank heavy junglers are going to be better at ganking at really specific times - and some junglers are going to change from being early-game to mid-game strong gankers. \n\nHigh sustain low CC junglers are those I think are going to get the biggest boost due to the smite changes - like Warwick, for example, who can get huge value from pre-6 CC via Smite.\n\nSeems generally to me though, that high sustain junglers will gank best at level 2-3, and lower-sustain higher CC junglers better at 5+ ganks.","replies":[{"poster":"Homura Akemi","date":"2014-11-22T01:47:26.997+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"you are 100% correct, i've seen warwick and what not return simply because of their sustain and it makes me sad i cant help lanes at level 3 as vi and what not.

Worked rather well.\nYou get the buffs from just smiting the big minion of each camp (except of course Red and Blue buff you still must kill for the buff) which means your first camp can be supidly easy with a standard leash.\n\nWell at least Blue is super easy. Red would require taking extra time to walk around after smiting the big krug.\n\nBut yeah, if you start blue side, smite gromp, kill blue then kill gromp and move onto wolves, pretty simple really.\n\nAlso had some fun with the Shaco{{champion:35}}  jungler from the enemy team, thought he could be a right little prick in my jungle, so I smited the big wolf and out came the little vision sentinel, followed the prick all through my jungle forcing him to run away.","replies":[]}]}]}]}
