Will you ever add a way to achieve a key or key fragments?**\n\nThis is how the current tuning of the drop rate works:\n\n* It is possible to earn enough key fragments to open every chest you find in 4 week period.\n* You have to win to earn a key fragment. Performance does not factor into the drop rate outside of this.\n* You can earn key fragments in any mode that yields champion mastery points.\n* The drops are somewhat based on luck, but it’s weighted such that after a certain number of wins if you didn’t get a fragment we’ll just force a drop to avoid being screwed by RNG.\n* Getting enough keys to open 4 chests in a 4 week period is hard and requires a lot of play, but anybody can do it if they play enough.\n* We don’t have any plans to add additional ways to get key fragments atm, but it’s something we may do in the future.","replies":[]}]}
