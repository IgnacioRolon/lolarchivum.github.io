Rito games u should actually implement some kind of a detecting device that can detect how many deaths a person has or how often did they die for example if they run in and die and die again instantly that is not normal which means his a feeder and the other players on hs team shouldn&#039;t have to suffer from loosing lp or even getting demoted to a shittier rank like bronze 5; or u it can detect how long someone has afked if its longer than u can like 5-10 mins the team shouldn&#039;t loose any lp because it wasn&#039;t thier fault they had to 4v5 or even 3v5 that has happened to me many times and i have been demoted many times because of this but i really dont want this BULLSHIT to happen to other members of the community and they should&#039;t have to bare with a feeder or an afker. That is all i wont to tell u guys even though ur going to do nothing like always because i have posted soo much FUCKING SHIT on your boards and it has never have been handled or even looked at by a rioter,  because all u FUCKERS wanna do is make money by realising new skin and SHIT and dont give a FUCK about any of us.","replies":[{"poster":"Omni Presents","date":"2016-03-07T11:49:58.816+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"HOLY MOTHER MARY! Where the fuck is your grammar dude?\n\nI am not even going to bother reading that, but from what I can gather from the replies, you want a system that detects if someone is feeding and ban them or some shit?\n\nThe only system I can see that would work, is one that you can put people on a Do Not Play list. Yes, you can abuse this, but at least when those, unfortunately like yourself OP, put enough of us on that list, we will not have to play with you and therefore we get the better players.\n\nYou see, I couldn't care less for the win, I don't care for what KDA anyone gets, how much CS, or how useful they are, if they shut the fuck up and actually try to play the game, that is all that matters to me. You can suck ass for all I care, if you try your best I know you are at least trying, or pretending to try, that works for me. I care more for those who are aggressive little shits with an attitude problem and want them out than I do for bad players.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Ingénue","date":"2016-03-06T01:53:34.843+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"While it is frustrating to have these types of players in your games, your idea has been posed before. The issue is that no matter what you do, it can be abused so easily. \n\n* If you don't want to lose LP, you can flame someone till the rage quit. \n* One person could also \"take one for the team\" and leave. \n* Same happens if you don't like the look of the enemy comp/ lolnexus them to find out they are all better than you. Just make someone quit.\n* As for the feeders, sometimes people get camped and end up dying a lot\n* People on tilt die a lot\n* Like *JustTrash* said, someone can suck the entire game but be the sole reason their team wins in the end. \n\nIf you had a system that detects \"feeders\" based on ingame deaths, I would be banned 100x over. Not because I intentionally feed, but because I suck at the game. This would be the same for many players, especially those in your wonderful land of **low bronze**. \n\nOnto the next point of how to address these feeders/trollers/afkers-\n**Riot have implemented an ♥♥♥tonne of incentives to play in a premade 5.** \nWhat are these incentives? More mastery points, more IP, more hex tech loot (coming soon™). They even made it possible to queue with x many friends to play ranked. If you play with your mates, you wont have toxicity. You wont have feeders. You wont have AFK, trolls, or general potatoes. You can control who is in your team every single game and have the communication to come out victorious.\n\n**What are you waiting for? There is literally nothing to lose.

What the hell are you on about? You're probably the type of person that reports people just because they've died a lot, not because they were actually Feeding, like running down midlane while all the towers are still up or something. Everyone has bad games, so don't just go around reporting people for playing badly.","replies":[]},{"poster":"TrashDonnut","date":"2016-03-06T00:40:04.089+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"0/20/1 Nasus\n\nBackdoors and wins game\n\nGets banned?\n\nPretty stupid system tbh.","replies":[]},{"poster":"RHIN0","date":"2016-03-06T23:04:41.812+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"WOW a bronze 5 complaining about noob teams, alert the media!!","replies":[]}]}
