With the rise of assassins, you can expect 'mobile' ADCs such as Lucian or Ezreal to be on the rise or 'better at peeling' supports such as Thresh or Alistar. Not all assassins can one shot an ADC unless they're quite ahead. The only thing Riot has to balance is how easily they snowball. I will agree with Rengar being at the top of his game but the other assassins such as Kha'Zix needs some ramping up. \n\nAll we need to do is to get used to the changes. You can't expect Riot to only buff the roles you play. Asking rhetorically how many players will quit is also somewhat of a stretch; we understand you're frustrated but realistically, people who can't deal with these changes are the ones who leave. Is Riot perfect at balancing? No and they never will be, and that is the nature of a shifting, evolving and adapting meta. If everything is the exact same, the game will become boring. We need the movement that keeps us gamers on our toes and with Riot frequently adding more interesting elements of the game, League of Legends will only become more fun!\n\nAnd that is not to mention the fact that if something is blatantly out of control, they do take action and nerf the champions necessary. Patches are existent, but Riot can't nerf a champion just because one other specific type of player/champion is suffering. Either way, if something becomes out of control, ranked wouldn't be a problem since you're given the opportunity to ban and in normals; well they're normal casual games.","replies":[]},{"poster":"FatedSaviour","date":"2016-11-22T00:24:19.135+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"kat doesnt 1 shot now, SHES ACTUALLY BALANCES SOMEHOW, your right about the other assassins  tho, akali not so much","replies":[]},{"poster":"Toxic Shaco","date":"2016-11-19T18:51:37.901+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Whilst I agree the game needs to change to stop it becoming stale, change for the sake of change is a terrible idea.\n\nAnd its pretty damn obvious they put a lot more effort into some reworks than others.","replies":[]}]}
