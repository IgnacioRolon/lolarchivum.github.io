They'll manually review the case, determine if there's reason for a reduction/removal, and if not they'll be able to provide additional context that you likely wont be able to get from anyone else.\n\nGenerally speaking, any negative behaviour you may have exhibited could have contributed to a punishment, and depending on the types of behaviours and how much there was it may or may not have been enough to trigger a punishment. The tier of punishment would depend on your account history and standing (for example, if you received a 25-game chat restriction within the last several months, a 14-day suspension would make sense as the next punishment). Without further context (chat logs relevant to this case, and punishment history), we wont be able to provide more specific context for you.","replies":[]}]}
