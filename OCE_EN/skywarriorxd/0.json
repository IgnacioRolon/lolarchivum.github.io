Heal is great for early as it provides sustainability being able to keep u in lane either to get a kill or get more farm. It&#039;s also great to help your teammates during team fights although provide very little healing. \n\nExhaust is great for focusing on single targets. It&#039;s great for securing kills or trying to escape an adc chase or maybe practically any chase really.","replies":[{"poster":"Olee","date":"2015-12-27T02:55:04.942+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Don't take double heal man, there will be situation where it might be useful, but every other time, I would strongly advise against it. Basically, if there's are bursty assassins or assassiny kind of champions on the enemy team who you're afraid you won't be able to peel of your carries in time because they will just kill them too quickly, take exhaust. Ignite is useful if you have a good strong early game bot lane or if the enemy team has champions with absurd amounts of self healing (Mundo, Volibear, Darius etc.)","replies":[]},{"poster":"CHEESYLEEKS","date":"2015-12-26T22:09:59.699+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"exhaust gets you out of more jams than heal ever will, always try and prioritize to exhaust their adc, it also gets you into good opportunities for your adc to get a kill.\n\nas above stated, usually adc takes heal so two heals kinda pointless.","replies":[]},{"poster":"skywarriorxd","date":"2015-12-26T10:21:08.396+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thx guys!","replies":[]},{"poster":"Jink","date":"2015-12-24T12:34:18.097+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"If you both take heal and heal within something like 30 seconds of each other it applies a debuff and is 50% less effective with the 2nd heal.\n\nExhaust is a strong summoner spell and I've heard the pros say this season it's probably most likely that supports will be taking heal more often than ignite, if they ever do take ignite. In solo queue I take ignite on supports if im versing a healer support but if they have a trynd top as well as an ADC I take exhaust regardless because shutting down their damage is more advantageous and i have multiple people exhaust is strong against.\n\n(Xpecial).\n\n(Sometimes pro's take exhaust as ADC so supp can take heal if they're versing a strong combo/all-in ADC, or they lack peel).","replies":[]},{"poster":"JasonWazza","date":"2015-12-24T07:27:44.937+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It should be ADC has heal/barrier and support has Ignite (sustain lanes only)/Exhaust","replies":[]},{"poster":"Niji","date":"2015-12-24T03:37:05.280+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Ideally your ADC should be taking heal and you should take exhaust but should your ADC take Ignite/Barrier then you would have to decide between taking heal or exhaust, Exhaust is generally the best option on support because it is an amazing peel tool and fucks over assassins.","replies":[]}]}
