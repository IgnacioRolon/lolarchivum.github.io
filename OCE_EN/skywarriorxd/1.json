After a few minutes when we entered a small team fight i died to illaoi cause she is broken( jk I am just shit at the game), after I respawn I went back to my turrets which somehow weren't destroyed. The turrets started attacking minions that were in range of their radius, although strange enough the third turret started to attack illaoi even tho she is way out of range (illaoi is still alive...). This is hard to believe since well it's sounds be but it happened to me. I was wondering if u guys have any strange bugs or glitch happening to u.
