Autofill is not useful, im in silver and i would happily wait 20 minutes if i could have a role i could play. Im sure its useful in high elo for reducing que time but i would highly value quality over quantity. Discuss.\n\nEdit#1: Was tilted off my face when i wrote this. Alright anyone got the pros of autofill (except lower que times)? seems like only a pain to me and tilts me sideways. Also is autofill a relic of the old system from 2 seasons ago? Should it be removed for low elo? Maybe we could add a system that suggests champs for the autofill role? Sure it wont help higher elo people but for us plebs it would be much appreciated.","replies":[{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2017-03-14T11:03:57.605+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":0,"body":"As a quick addition to what Sesshomaru has said about the why. Autofill exists for a reason. You say you'd be happy to wait 20 minutes for a queue, but would you be happy to wait an hour? Maybe even longer? In lower elo the saturation of support (and sometimes bot) players is just too low once you combine it with the small ranked population we have on OCE.\n\nIt's a delicate balance between how long a wait is acceptable before it creates a greater negative experience than the positive of getting your preferred role. People argued and argued for two ranked queues, and seem to be generally happy now that we have them, but the consequence of that is that autofill is going to be on pretty much all the time.\n\nEven if you only learn one champion in your off roles (though preferably a less popular one so it doesn't get stolen or banned) you will gain some valuable experience. You don't have to carry every game, if you get autofilled, just do your best to hold your own, if you can't get fed then just stay even.\n___\nAs for some support advice specifically (since it's mostly what you'll be filled as), I'd stay away from supports like Soraka or Sona. People seem to think they are brainless and easy supports but they really aren't. There is a lot of nuance there, and if you aren't experienced with them it is VERY easy to feed. As a support main myself, I can't tell you how many times someone has picked Sona as their \"safe\" pick and I've absolutely destroyed them. In the same vein a good Soraka is scary, but a bad one is damn near useless.\n\nIf you are good with skill shots Nami is a good choice, since she can do a bit of everything and is easy to learn (though hard to master). Lulu is also a good safe caster support with a lot of utility, but she's also harder to learn, and for the inexperienced I'd really recommend the sustain lane since it's easier to cover your mistakes with heals than shields. If you prefer tanks try someone like Braum or Leona with good scalings who have solid team utility even if they are behind. You want to go for the champs that can still be useful even if they are feeding.\n\nAnd for love of all that is holy please do not pick Blitzcrank if you don't know how to play him. You can bet on that lucky hook ignite all you want but then you have nothing. He has very little to offer in team fights (the silence is strong but the duration isn't) and shines early, so if you can't deliver on that early promise then don't pick it. Really if you don't have communication in bot/a really damn good ADC you're just going to have a bad time.\n\nIf all else fails and you can't play any of the 'real' supports then just pick a CC heavy mid you know how to play like Syndra or something. It's not ideal, but it's better than playing someone you have no idea how to play. Just remember you'll be playing with a heavily limited mana pool and much less damage than you are used to.","replies":[{"poster":"Fitzky","date":"2017-03-14T12:33:28.315+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":2,"body":"> As a quick addition to what Sesshomaru has said about the why.

There are a lot of variables, and they vary a lot from player to player. That said, it is certainly one of those things difficult to articulate without official stats. I'm confident that turning autofill off would cause big problems, but also don't have anything official to back it up other than words. The lack of visible stats is one of Riot's biggest failings imo tbh.\n\nThat said, you never experiencing a queue over 5 mins theoretically means it is working as it should, being on when it needs to be and off when it doesn't, even if I can't definitively prove that it is auto fill having this effect for you.\n___\n10+ minutes is a little different than an hour, which is usually why I pose such a question when people ask about autofill. It is a matter of degree, inconvenience vs reward.\n\n___\nI haven't been in Bronze for long so I can't really comment there, but in silver certainly there were plenty of people that got away with going even, the trouble was them having to learn how to play safe to actually stay even instead of snowballing the wrong way. It seems to be something much more uncommon there. I imagine it's an experience and perspective thing, but if you are willing to learn then that's what matters right? It's the best you can do in such circumstances.\n___\nMaybe it's my support mindset, but if I was ADC I'd much rather have my support on someone they knew how to play, than a real support they've never played before. I did say if all else fails. It's hardly ideal, but ultimately a comfort pick is better than a pick you can't play.","replies":[{"poster":"Fitzky","date":"2017-03-15T03:52:16.954+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"I still love how all the uneducated retards downvote my posts because they don't know what constructive criticism is.","replies":[{"poster":"Mozzie25","date":"2017-03-15T04:11:24.678+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Your criticism isn't constructive you complain about everything.\n\nAnd part of constructive criticism is offering ideas.

While now, you're almost guaranteed one of 2 preferred roles, and everyone freaks out on the odd occasion they have to go support.\nit makes no sense.\n\nMy only concern with the new system _(which is not actually with the system itself, but how the players use the system)_ is that everyone only needs to learn 2 roles, so they do (cos theyre lazy), and they get very very good at those 2 roles (becasue thats all they ever play). Then they get autofilled, and have no clue what they're doing because they haven't practiced that role. But the people they're up against **are** in their preferred role (and remember this one of the only 2 roles they ever play). So you get a lvl 7 Thresh with 1,000,000 mastery points, against a first time Sona, and the game quickly spirals out of control.\n\nIn my opinion, the new system is great, you go into ranked knowing that you will most likely be able to perform at your best, and be ranked according to what youre good at playing. However because everyone only ever masters 2 roles, the difficulty of ranked as a whole rises up, becasue everyone is playing what they're good at, and so on the odd occasion you down get your role, it is a lot lot harder for you and your team.\n\nThis is of course solved simply by everyone just spending a little bit of time practicing other roles _(but good luck trying to pry 12 year olds away from Yasuo and Lee....)_\n\nSo really its not the system but the players that are at fault here.","replies":[{"poster":"Mal 0wns","date":"2017-03-14T11:18:45.923+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I understand the old system that was in place but wasnt that removed to reduce toxicity?
