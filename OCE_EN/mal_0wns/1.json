It would make it so that you can build strong team comps and your team can know what you are comfortable playing.\n\n---\n\nHowever I think that a possible issue may lye in how to add this into the current champion select interface. Currently there is a lot of information on screen, all of the champions you can pick, what your teammates are hovering or have picked, the champions that have been banned and more. Along with this the amount of bans that are going to be added will make this space even more tight and might make the interface very cluttered. This can lead to confusion and getting lost as to where you are supposed to be looking on the screen. \n\nNow if Riot were to add up to 3 hovers, I am trying to think currently where those would be located. It could be a possibility that people are able to preset their 3 favourite champions for each role, so that they don't have to set it up each time and where the current hover is displayed it shows their favourite pick. From there summoners on your team would be able to mouse over the favourite hover to see what their 3 champions that they want to play are. The other thing is how would you go about changing the hovers in champion select? It might come down to a Summoner Spell type selection where you can change between the different tabs at the top, however this might make things confusing as well.\n\n---\n\nRiot is big on clarity and making sure that the choices you make have a visual impact. Do you have ideas of how this ideas yourself about how a system like this could be implemented without removing the visual clarity from the current champions select?\n\nLet me know what you think.\n\n~Elam","replies":[{"poster":"Mal 0wns","date":"2017-01-13T00:25:53.355+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"i was thinking that you could have two smaller circles below the current one and to select which champs to hover you would click on those smaller circles, maybe the current hovered champ selection could be reduced in size to fit the other two below it as, i do think the idea of being able to pre select your favorite champs would be a good idea, but i think that it wouldnt do as well if you got your off role or perhaps autofilled? Although i guess you could have preferences for each role, hover over someones name and they have pre selected five champs, in case of autofill, or you could make it so thatyou pick 3 preferred champs for each role in summoners rift, and it displays those three whenever you get that role in champ select, this would account for autofill although this may be too complicated, and it would be better to keep it simple, there is also the downfall that people can use this information if a dogde happens, they know what you are comfortable with and can ban it out, especially with the new 10 ban system. The thing is, i think quite a lot of people dont hover anything and this whole system might be redundant, though i do feel like it would be worth trying to better promote stratagizing with your team, even for the small amount of people who do actually hover. I will usually hover a champ, in bronze this isnt much of a problem (large player base if dodges happen wont be same people), i play Darius, who is/was a high priority ban in bronze, and i need to make sure my own team doesnt ban him out, but i do see that in higher elos it would be a much bigger problem for dodges because of the smaller player base.
