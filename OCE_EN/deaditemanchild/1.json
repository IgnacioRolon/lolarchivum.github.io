Waiting an 30 mins in the Leave Buster queue, trying to resolve why you are getting kicked is incredibly frustrating to troubleshoot. Reinstalled the game whilst waiting for a Riot Tech to get in contact with me; who then tells me that they don&#039;t know when it will be fixed, and to post on the NA servers (not the OCE server board) to see if anyone else fixed it. Not happy.\r\n\r\nThen, today, I run the update, and I can&#039;t even log in because the server is rejecting the patch.\r\n\r\nNot happy mang, Not happy.\r\n\r\nNow that my rant is over, _**Anyone else having this issue, and did forcing a repair resolve the issue**_, or do I need to plead with my housemate to chew up more bandwidth while he is trying to play his working multiplayer game?","replies":[{"poster":"AggelosXdan","date":"2016-02-11T17:34:58.215+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"fuck you riot","replies":[]},{"poster":"Deep Terror Nami","date":"2016-02-10T10:10:05.084+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey deaditemanchild,\n\n> Please force a repatch following these steps;\n\n* Go to your Riot Games folder (Default path: C:/Riot Games/League of Legends)\n* Open the following directory:\n * C:\\Riot Games\\League of Legends\\RADS\\projects\\lol_air_client\\releases\\{highest version number}\n* Delete the following files:\n - releasemanifest \n - S_OK\n* Open the Deploy folder\n* Delete the following folders/files:\n - lib (folder) \n - META-INF (folder) \n - mod (folder) \n - lolclient.exe (file) \n - lolclient.swf (file) \n - locale.properties (file)\n* Restart League of Legends\n\n> IF THAT DID NOT WORK, PLEASE TRY THE FOLLOWING:\n\n* Delete the following folder:\n * <C:\\Riot Games\\League of Legends\\RADS\\projects\\lol_launcher\n* Restart League of Legends","replies":[{"poster":"SerbanMorcovul","date":"2016-02-11T16:47:22.471+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Dude, thanks a lot!!!","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"deaditemanchild","date":"2016-02-10T10:10:17.312+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"For those having this issue, forcing the client to repatch resolves the issue.
