Riot could have done a much better job, and I don&#039;t think it&#039;s too much to ask for if you&#039;re spending what&#039;s essentially $5 for each one. I&#039;m not claiming I could personally do better but it seems more like mediocre fan art than something done by a professional. \n\nI also resent OCE being used as a test server for larger regions, like how many bugs can a simple graphic have? Makes it seems like they don&#039;t care about us as much.  ;/","replies":[]}
