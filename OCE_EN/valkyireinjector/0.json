Where Champions that run on Mana always have more each time they level, plus items to give them more. Unlike energy champions I feel like they should get more each time they level up. It&#039;s hard to explain but having 200 energy e.g. Akali, the only way to get energy back is by using Q and then either using another ability to refund some energy back, this is the same for Shen and Zed for Shadows.\r\n\r\nShould they get more energy? I think they should it will make team fighting easier for them, as well as engaging. Wish I could provide more detail but I feel like they need to have a rework or something done to them to improve them. Other Champiosn like Garen and Katarina really don&#039;t matter same goes for champions like Shyvana and Gnar generating rage/fury is easy by staying combat. It&#039;s just energy Champions I find are REALLY dependent on energy. E.g. Shen Taunt is around 100 or 110 Energy, there goes half his bar. (If he doesn&#039;t land it)\r\n\r\nIMO they need a change.","replies":[{"poster":"Garens Harem","date":"2015-10-01T11:55:01.277+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"hell no","replies":[]},{"poster":"Æ’amous","date":"2015-10-02T01:46:25.923+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> IMO they need a change.\n\nIMO they dont.\nEnergy regens by itself, a lot faster than mana... I don't see a need to increase/change the speed at which it regenerates. I do think some champions energy costs (Shen) need to be tweaked a little bit.","replies":[]},{"poster":"VENI VIDI VICI","date":"2015-10-01T13:32:31.967+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It's to take more out of free sustained dmg without trading for it.
