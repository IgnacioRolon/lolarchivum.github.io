It's not uncommon for skill to be irrelevant. Not to mention, it's an entirely different map than SR, it only has 1 lane and no jungle. When it comes right down to it there are plenty of people in high elo that only know how to play 1-10 champions, and only on SR. It's also entirely possible they've been boosted. Given that, it is accurate that, in a situation where they have a champion randomly picked for them from a pool of potentially 100+, they will end up with a much lower MMR, one that more accurately represents their skill with **all** the champions they own rather than just a select few.\n\nIf you were expecting people to do just as well in ARAM as they do in SR, you're either naive or a complete idiot.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Zorphiax","date":"2015-10-04T06:52:21.844+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"a level 19 might just of been playing with a high rated MMR Summoner which happened to be on the same team as you.","replies":[]}]}
