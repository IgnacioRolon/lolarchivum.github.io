From there it stayed at 99%. I closed the launcher reopened it. It starts updating again but at 33%, from there it&#039;s been continuously scanning files. Highest I&#039;ve let it go up to is around 15K.\n\nI have tried restarting and shutdown before. Not sure what the issue is. I hope leaving it over night wil get the patch done and over with.
