I won one game, lost two. The fourth game I played our mid brand afked, and our wukong started intentionally feeding after feeding lanes (because he played like crap), He doesn&#039;t talk, brand doesn&#039;t talk. We lose, this game is a waste of my time and energy. But why do I lose LP for this, why does this not count as a loss forgiven or null game.\r\n\r\nWhy is your system so broken, that even if I post this message here and bitch and moan. This won&#039;t be fixed, I won&#039;t get back LP. I can count at least 5 instances where I lost a game due to intentional feeders and afks over the past week. I don&#039;t want to hear how &quot;they will be banned with the new feeder checker&quot; or whatever. It ruined my game now, time I can&#039;t get back. Punishment after my team has already been affected is pointless this game has already been ruined for three players. And we won&#039;t get any compensation for it. Him getting banned or reported after the game is absolutely meaningless.","replies":[{"poster":"McRuthless","date":"2015-09-25T17:36:11.067+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"You know you also gain LP when someone trolls or AFKs on the enemy team. Yet for some reason there's never anyone on here being like \"man, this system is so broken, I didn't deserve LP for this win, please take it away from me\". You win about as much as you lose from trolls, whether you think so or not, so there's no point complaining about it.","replies":[{"poster":"Naevia","date":"2015-09-26T01:43:37.298+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Yes, honestly if I get an afk or troll then I just stop trying to win and have fun with the enemy team.

Get on with your game. You shouldn't worry about what they're doing, you can't change their behaviour, so change yours. If theres something you can do to improve your chances of winning, do it, eg. buying wards, playing safe if behind and farming, don't face check, don't risk dragon if they're all there. Just ward it, get the timer and set up for next time. Just because you're behind doesn't necessarily mean you've lost the game. Sure there's instances where you do get a feeder or AFK, but I've played games where we've comeback from a massive loss to win the game. All it takes is one mistake. Just keep positive and if you lose early game, look towards late game, farm up and get items. Again, if someones being toxic, mute and report them, theres nothing much else you can do...
