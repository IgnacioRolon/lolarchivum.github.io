Maybe releasing a new chromapack- for example all pink chromas for breast cancer or all blue chromas for prostate cancer etc. and then the appropriate cancer ribbons as purchasable event ward skins and summoner icons. These things wouldn&#039;t be expensive or time consuming for riot to produce so maybe having all the profits from these going directly to cancer research wouldn&#039;t be such a big ask. A bigger ask would maybe be players donating their spare RP, like you know that 27 RP or whatever that you have lying there useless and then Riot converting that donated RP into real money, because after all, we did pay for that RP. Anyways, I think this would be a good way to raise money and awareness for cancer, all the while pitching a good image of riot and league to the public if it is successful, furthermore promoting the game as well.","replies":[{"poster":"csm","date":"2015-08-01T02:00:54.876+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"They should try to reduce the cancer laying dormant in their playerbase first.","replies":[]},{"poster":"greypants","date":"2015-07-31T04:57:35.791+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"For a day or maybe a week?","replies":[]},{"poster":"Talon12","date":"2015-08-03T02:37:31.651+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Agreed, treat the cancer... this game produces.\n\nAnd help them innocent babies with cancer ;-;","replies":[]},{"poster":"Coolbluey","date":"2015-07-31T22:58:43.464+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Riven","replies":[]}]}
