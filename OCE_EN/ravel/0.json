This causes me to be unable to release the ability at the right time in most cases, basically making the champion useless.\r\n\r\nSteps to reproduce: Play any of those champs I listed and use the ability.\r\n\r\nBasically means I can&#039;t use my most played champ, Vi, since that patch and just wondering if there was any fix out there for anyone else who had this issue. Of all the people I play with only one other person had this bug and he just gave up on fixing it.\r\n\r\nThanks in advance","replies":[{"poster":"HORSE OF FORCE","date":"2015-06-15T10:11:27.426+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Are you talking about frame-lag or actually higher ping (check in-game with Ctrl+F)?
