I am currently a G4 Support, with a ranged spectrum of different options (Janna, Karma, Leona, Blitz, Thresh) and willing to learn more and grow as a team. I&#039;ve normally only been used to playing as a solo-unit, which may sound wierd as a support but hey...such is life :)\r\n\r\nI am semi-flexible with game times, but not available anywhere between 4pm - 11pm AEDT on account of my running my own business between these hours. Pizza&#039;s dont make themselves ;) Thankfully, it should put me in the clear for scheduling of OOL games on weekends. Worst case scenario, I might miss the last round of each day (If it comes to that).\r\n\r\nHoping that someone gives this post a look over, and I&#039;m happy for any &#039;Trial by Fire&#039; or anything like that someone may have in store for me :)  Hit me up on here or send me through a message in-game. Cheers !","replies":[]}
