Then after that i played a few more games went to sleep and woke up just to find that my account was perma banned for using a 3rd party program i was very confused and frustrated at this point so i submitted a ticket telling them that it must of been a mistake. However the person on the other end didnt really help me in anyway he kept on just saying it was a 3rd party program, this made me more frustrated and confused due to the fact i have never used anything to alter league other than a macro for CY@ and lolwiz and plus i dont even know how to hack or script so my point of view is that i am getting banned for doing nothing but playing the game properly. Please can someone give me another reason why i was banned or anyway to help me out i dont want the 1464 hrs spent on league to go to nothing and the $1700 i have spent on my account just go down the drain like that. Someone please help me.","replies":[{"poster":"Ing√©nue","date":"2017-04-08T00:33:10.010+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Unfortunately due to this being an account specific inquiry we can't help you out on the boards. \nYour best shot is to continue to talk to Riot support. They won't give you what 3rd party application got you banned (as divulging this kind of information has potential to mess with their detection systems), although they can have a second look at your account. \n\nIs their any possibility you were compromised/given your account details to anyone else at all (boosters, friends, siblings etc)? \n**For anyone else that is reading this, its a good time to change your password :)**","replies":[]},{"poster":"TheDemonEmperor","date":"2017-04-07T09:38:49.676+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"what is ur banned account ign?","replies":[{"poster":"Fitzky","date":"2017-04-07T10:06:03.551+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Even if your account gets perma-banned you can still post on forums I'm pretty sure","replies":[{"poster":"Project Xayah","date":"2017-04-07T10:10:05.782+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"^This.\n\nIn-game bans and boards bans work separately, so someone who is banned in-game is still able to post on the boards and someone who is banned on the boards is still able to play the game.\n\nLooking at OP's match history, this would appear to be the banned account.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Project Xayah","date":"2017-04-07T10:17:11.970+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Referring to the information on what is and isn't allowed, LoLwiz is (currently) classified as \"allowed\" (this is subject to change, however that is unlikely due to it's nature). If I had to hazard a guess at what caused the ban it would be either the macro (Riot's acceptance of macros is limited to elements that have no direct impact on gameplay, for example chat messages, however remains in a \"use at your own risk\" state) *or* another program that may have been running in the background that would have been picked up as being dis-allowed (if you can recall every program you had running at the time that would help clarify, and an important thing to consider is that it may be something you wouldn't expect to trigger the system) which could be a particular problem on a shared or public computer.","replies":[]}]}
