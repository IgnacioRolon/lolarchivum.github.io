I just got the items because the icons looked &#039;op&#039;\r\nI had no idea the mute button existed, or how to disable the all chat. It had only been enabled because My friend spent 3 mins telling me how to do it via skype so I could see the enemies messages. \r\n\r\nMaybe you have one to share? {{summoner:21}}","replies":[{"poster":"Typhon","date":"2016-02-10T20:37:36.028+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"people will hate me but i saw teemo and thought he was a god so i mained him for 30 levels playing \"attack speed on hit\" teemo simply because i liked the pfft noise he made while aa.","replies":[{"poster":"Icarus1314","date":"2016-02-11T11:03:28.843+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"can i say... \ni always pump atk speed on teemo for the same reason? \n*inserts like button*","replies":[]},{"poster":"Roguestoney","date":"2016-02-10T20:44:51.011+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Typhon,realm=OCE,application-id=Ntey9fRZ,discussion-id=Eq3duoJE,comment-id=0004,timestamp=2016-02-10T20:37:36.028+0000)\n>\n> people will hate me but i saw teemo and thought he was a god so i mained him for 30 levels playing \"attack speed on hit\" teemo simply because i liked the pfft noise he made while aa.\n\nBest reason i have ever heard to play Teemo :^)","replies":[{"poster":"Reported4Verbal","date":"2016-02-11T04:56:40.283+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Agreed !\n{{champion:17}}","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"HelloWeirdo","date":"2018-01-15T23:22:36.949+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"When I first started, I:\n Thought runes were useless\n \nThought masteries were useless\n\nThought passives were useless\n\nBought AD as Karma\n\nCharged bot lane with no minions or friendly champions and occasionally went 5v1 on people\n\nFlashed at random moments just to go slightly faster\n\nThought wards were useless\n\nOccasionally soloed Baron or Dragon at lvl 1\n\nWalked straight through jungle to enemy base (also at lvl 1)\n\nHad no idea how to buy things from the store both in-game and out-of-game\n\nSpammed abilities at thin air\n\nAnd 99% of the time I had no idea where I was or what lane I was in.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Icarus1314","date":"2016-02-11T11:22:00.142+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"advertising adult sites XD lol\nwell, few of my silly things to share for laugh if possible\n\n- until very recent, i didn't know i could atk with A+left mouse (i been playing that much RTS and stuff.. should've known better\n\n- until very recent, i also didn't know that mute function exist\n\n- the first time i saw blindman fly kicking enemy out of nowhere scared the shxt out of me\n\n- i often press R instead of 4 when trying to place ward... \nand once after i did that with Soraka, a team mate said \"good timing! saved my life and gave me double kill!\" (...facepalm\n\n- at one stage, i really wanna learn Kalista\nthat's coz i once saw that she(?) has this skill to chuck team mate into enemy group\ni wanted to learn her(?) so i can chuck team mates who pisses me off into enemy and watch them die\nyet, just today, i've learned that it's the team mate who controls the chucking... i was devastate...\n\n- the first hero i play was Ashe, for a good while, my first lv5 skill was always the E... because i think having views is a good idea\nwell it is... but yah...","replies":[]},{"poster":"Fitzky","date":"2016-02-10T08:06:04.025+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I once had a game full of people who spoke Chinese, since I couldn't speak Chinese I kept replying in English and all I could see was replies with question marks XD they were just as confused as to what I was saying  as I was to them","replies":[{"poster":"Icarus1314","date":"2016-02-11T11:10:08.753+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"just say \"ni hao!\"","replies":[]},{"poster":"Reported4Verbal","date":"2016-02-10T08:23:33.232+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Haha nice one,. \nI had a similar game to this but our ryze who was our third botlaner only spoke spanish and arabic  characters.\nHe was also intentionally feeding too haha","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Ing√©nue","date":"2016-02-11T07:01:16.921+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"**First time league: **\nWas level 15ish and was feeling super proud of myself for not dying during an intermediate bot game. At the time, I was sitting at the gaming table in the halls, and the guy next to me asked me if I thought I was ready for normals. Thinking I was a super cool kid and good at video games for not dying in a bot game, I said I was.\n Got into champ select and I instalocked morgana (I was new to the game, nobody does champ select etiquette in bots and people rage at you if you don't lock in quick enough, so I didn't know any better). Anyway, I ended up as support, which I had no idea how to play or what it was, so I continued playing as I would in a bot game, trying to kill the minions, etc.  I was feeding pretty hard because I had only been playing the game for a couple of weeks and was up against level 30s.\n Turns out the guy I was sitting next to was a gigantic rager, and started screaming at me (irl) full blast in a dining room full of people for the entire duration of the game, starting from champ select. The others in my team weren't much better, constantly raging in chat. Pretty sure I got 9x report after that game. I ended up crying and didn't play another normal till I hit level 30 (or super close to).\n\nOn the plus side, I am now a better player than the ragey guy and I learned early not to be a toxic asshat.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Roguestoney","date":"2016-02-10T20:09:03.889+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I did the typical buy more than 1 set of boots so i could hunt/run away from people faster{{summoner:6}}","replies":[]},{"poster":"Sailor Jupiter","date":"2016-02-10T09:32:47.315+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"In my early levels I remember many a time when playing with friends we'd go with 3 people in the bot lane for that \"lane dominance\" but then we'd never actually punish our opposing laners or take the tower and we'd all end up super behind :P","replies":[]},{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2016-02-10T09:03:07.670+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"5v5 PvP, we were all brand new to the game.
