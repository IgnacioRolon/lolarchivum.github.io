After many messages to riots support team with heaps of information that was hard to remember about my account (to prove I&#039;m not a hacker and It&#039;s me who made the account) the finally unbanned me.\nSee http://boards.oce.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/player-behaviour/w0hjnlEz-suspended-for-malicious-changes for a lot more info on that.\nI just got an email saying banned untill the year 2100 which is for account security. \n\nSomeone please help.. Very sad because I can&#039;t play and I didn&#039;t break the rules. I appreciate that they may care about my account security but this is ridiculous.. come on :( My password is so long and ridiculous that no one is going to guess it. It uses special characters, numbers, capital letters, and is long too. I know someone didn&#039;t hack into my account. However I did receive an email for a password reset request that I did not make a few days ago for my account. But it wasn&#039;t reset because I logged into my account just now and the suspended error message popped up\nI know I own the account but riot dont seem to believe me after heaps of information about my account they unbanned me. About  roughly 10 days later, I&#039;m in the same position again?\nUpdate: I can't log into the support page. It says incorrect password (I know it's the correct password and someone couldn't have guessed it and changed it.) I requested a password reset through forgot my password and changed it.  It still says wrong password when I log in.","replies":[{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2016-02-19T09:02:30.393+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Until we can work this out, if you could please reply to the old ticket, or open ONE new ticket if the old one has been closed and give us the ticket number.","replies":[{"poster":"Nicole27","date":"2016-02-19T10:16:53.099+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hello,\nthis is my sons account.
