This is a lot of information, but we want to ensure we only recover accounts to their original creators.\n\nPlease do your best to provide the following:\n\nAccount Username (what you log-in with):\nAccount Summoner name (your in game name):\nPlatform you play on (NA, EU West, EU Nordic & East, OCE):\nOriginal email address used to register the account:\nCreation date of the account:\nLocation where the account was registered (City, Country):\nList of locations that you have played on this account (City and Country):\nYour current IP address (Use http://whatsmyip.net/ to find your IP address):\nFirst five champions ever purchased on this account:\nName any refunded champions or skins:\nDate of Birth:\nAny other people (including family members/friends) that have ever had access to the account:\nUsername and Server of all League of Legends accounts (s):\nHas your email account ever been compromised?

I don’t currently have enough information to formally verify you as the original creator of the account. With that in mind, please confirm the following billing information so that I can further investigate the account.\n\nLocation of RP purchases (City and Country):\nEmail address linked to PayPal account:\nUnique PayPal transaction IDs associated with purchase(s):\nPhone number, mobile provider, and country used for SMS transactions:\nAny PaySafe Card PIN/Transaction IDs:\nAny pre-paid RP card PIN numbers:\nThe first 6 digits, last 4 digits, and expiration date of any credit card(s) used to purchase RP:\nAny transaction or confirmation numbers received via email for this account:\nIf you have any other information that might be valuable in verifying this account, please let me know!

I am very very sure i got it rigjt even know its 3 years since i made the account.\n\nI appreciate your cooperation in providing additional information on the account. However, as of this point in time, I'm afraid we have reached the end of the recovery process. I'm afraid the information you have provided does not allow me to return this account to you.\n\nI cannot release the account in question as of this time since we were not yet able to reach a sufficient level of certainty. Please understand that these steps are taken to ensure the security of our Players and accounts. I realize that this can be quite frustrating and sincerely apologize for the inconvenience it may cause.\n\nYou are more than welcome to respond to this ticket should you locate information that may be able to prove that you are the original creator of the account.
