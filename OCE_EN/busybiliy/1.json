As I have stated up there ^ I know that it is league causing the problems. Sometimes these drops happen during champion select, sometimes they happen later on during my actual game. My internet provider is TPG, I am playing on a HP Pavilion 15 using WiFi. If there is any more information that you need please let me know.\r\n\r\n-Lumes (LegitDank was a meme, I regret everything)","replies":[{"poster":"SephirothSG","date":"2017-07-01T05:07:58.973+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey there,\n\nCould you please do the following for me;\n\n* [Switch to a public DNS](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues#wq5)\n* [Download WinMTR](https://sourceforge.net/projects/winmtr/files/WinMTR-v092.zip/download) and run a traceroute to the following IP.
