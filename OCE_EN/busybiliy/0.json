It does this sometimes and I have no way of telling when it will happen next. Now unlike some people I have limited time available to play league, so when something like this happens I am not only forced to waste an hour and 40 minutes of my life waiting, my friends don&#039;t want to play with me (as they too would have to wait) I decided to just suck it up and play a quick game. A few of my friends decide to wait with me so we can all play together. After queuing for 22 minutes we finally get a game, only to have one of my friends not accept in time. Now, because of my mate, I am forced to wait _another_ 20 minutes before I can get a game. At this point my friends are sick of me and decide to play by themselves, which is fair enough. I queue up again and eventually get into a game. 3 minutes into it and our top still hasn&#039;t moved from base. Someone starts a remake vote. Bam, 40 minutes of my life down the drain. I realise that this is a kinda pointless post, but as I said earlier I wanted somewhere to let off some steam. Who knows, maybe Riot will do something about it.","replies":[{"poster":"BusyBilIy","date":"2017-10-22T09:50:52.351+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Quick update: Just got another game only to have my internet cut out again.
