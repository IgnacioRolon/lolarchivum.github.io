As we know Aatrox&#039;s W passive is; &quot;While toggled on Aatrox deals bonus damage and fills up a portion of his Blood Well every third subsequent attack. While toggled off Aatrox restores health.&quot; Here is my issue, Aatrox&#039;s W ability tells us it activates every third subsequent attack, however with a purchase of Guinsoo&#039;s Rageblade this reduces Aatrox&#039;s W passive to toggle every second subsequent attack. Please look into this Riot :)\r\n\r\n-Sincerely FattyArbuckle123 {{summoner:31}}","replies":[{"poster":"Fitzky","date":"2017-05-06T04:02:08.242+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Can I just clarify first, you know how Guinsoos works right?","replies":[{"poster":"Talon12","date":"2017-05-06T05:56:50.648+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Guinsoo procs onhit effects, not on attack effects, aatrox w is onhit, but the way aatrox w tooltip is worded, it sounds as if it is on attack effect not onhit.
