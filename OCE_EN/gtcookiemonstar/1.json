Have been playing since late Season 3 but not seriously until Season 4 where I was placed silver at the end of the season. I have over 1000 ranked games in total, 600+ this season alone.  I am looking for a Silver or hopefully Gold ranked 5s team looking to improve and develop as players. I am hoping that with enough time and dedication, reaching a higher rank like Plat for Season 6 will be possible.\r\n\r\nI wouldn&#039;t say that I main any position, because I can play all positions well, but recently I have been playing a lot more top and jungle, and have found success in these roles. I am pretty decent at both mid and adc too. My worst role is support but as I said I am pretty well rounded in all roles, and if needed can fill the support role.\r\n\r\nI have skype, teamspeak and curse voice for communication. \r\n\r\nIf anyone has any offers for me just add me in game: GTCookieMonstar\r\nand state why you are adding me.","replies":[{"poster":"ViolinMaker53","date":"2015-12-17T08:37:08.706+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"whats ur elo?","replies":[]}]}
