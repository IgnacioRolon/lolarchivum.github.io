But for some odd reason, I can&#039;t seem to login... :(\r\nI&#039;ve tried &quot;Initiate Full Repair&quot; already and it didn&#039;t help. I&#039;ve tried going on the help/support pages and that didn&#039;t help either.\r\nI&#039;ve also tried looking at other threads with the same problem but they don&#039;t help either. Now my initial thoughts on this problem is that considering Kayn came out today, lots of players from OCE region would be online right now playing him. Hence making the servers really full which in turn gives me &quot;Unable to connect to login queue&quot;. However, my friends aren&#039;t having this problem and it&#039;s really bugging me that I&#039;m the only one with this problem. So if anyone has suggestions or if ANYONE knows the solution, please reply ASAP. Much appreciated.","replies":[{"poster":"Zaps","date":"2017-07-13T01:11:53.602+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"We're currently trying to track down why this is happening for some players.
