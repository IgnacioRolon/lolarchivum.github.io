I know. Believe me I know, macs are not optimal for gaming. The fact is, I already had my high end mac before I discovered the amazing world of gaming and can barely afford bills let alone a new computer. However, Apple have decided to be unnecessarily cruel and remove support for 32bit apps. This means I can barely play League at all on the new Mojave operating system, and it sucks. I work 40hrs a week doing a hellish PhD I can&#039;t escape from and one of the few things that help me unwind and enjoy life is a game of League...should tell you something about how stressful my job is if League is my go-to relaxation. Point is, I&#039;m not computer savvy and I have many reasons for not downgrading my OSX, the main one being that League is the only thing being affected right now for me and frankly I just know I&#039;ll mess it up somehow and wreck my computer. I get that its a lot of work to re-develop an app, but for all us mac users who unwittingly fell into Apple&#039;s trap and didn&#039;t realise there would be compatibility issues...pls. I&#039;ll beg if I have to. \r\n\r\nSome specific issues:\r\n1. The sound quality has gone so bad that it sounds like someone is trying land a helicopter on my roof and yet the game sounds are so quiet and muffled I keep checking my ears for cotton wool\r\n2. The first game I played after upgrading stayed on 01 FPS and froze my computer so that I had to pull the plug. By the time I managed to reconnect, I was the richest person in the game and my team was obliterating the enemy&#039;s nexus - that probably says more about my gaming ability but lets not go there right now\r\n3. Each subsequent game has resulted in some truly interesting glitches, the most entertaining probably being that my client decided to play the KDA song slowed down with a demonic twist for the entire game. I still can&#039;t work out how that happened. I&#039;ve had spells refuse to work or chose to work at highly inconvenient times. I&#039;ve had my champion decide of it&#039;s own accord to hang under a turret for a nice short laser shower. \r\n\r\nI&#039;ve run system diagnostics, closed every program and basically tried everything a computer illiterate person can do - any suggestions right now would be appreciated. The thing is, this problem isn&#039;t going away. It has to be addressed or Riot will lose most of their mac players. We exist and we are suffering. Please Riot, can we have a 64 bit version?","replies":[{"poster":"Tele","date":"2018-11-19T04:41:34.508+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey NeonMist,\n\nThat really sucks :( I imagine Riot's working on something with regards to this, but it could be a while. I'll try be as helpful as possible with a few suggestions, but keep in mind that although I own a mac and know a bit about them, I don't play League on mine. Ok here's a few things that might work.\n\n* **Close client during games**\nHaving the client open during games is probably not helping, so best to close it. Click the gearbox in the top right corner of the client (could be top left corner on mac) to open up settings. Once you're there you should be able check the _\"Close client during game box\"_. If you're also having trouble with the client then check the _\"Enable low spec mode\"_ box as well.\n\n\n* **Disable sound**\nA lot of your problems appear to be as a result of sound. Playing without sound sucks but we might be able to at least stop the freezing and glitching by disabling it. To disable sound click the gearbox in the top right corner of the client. Something like this should show up \n\n https://i.gyazo.com/12501469d13b8275d61b1ab507ca2de4.png\nYou want to click on the two tabs circled in red. On the first one, uncheck the _\"enable sound\"_ box (it should be towards the top). On the second one check the _\"disable all sound\"_ box (you'll need to scroll down to the bottom).\n\n\n* **Check if you have Time Machine set up**\nIf you have Time Machine set up, the downgrade process it really easy. Go to system preferences and click on _\"Time Machine\"_, if it says _\"Select Backup Disk...\"_ you're out of luck. But if it doesn't say that anywhere the let me know and we should be able to downgrade you easily!\n\n\n* **Force Repatch and Reinstall**\nMost people appear to only have a problem with the microphone on macOS Mojave, so it's possible this is actually a problem with your installation and you just need to repair the game. It's pretty easy do to, just download the [Hextech Repair Tool](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/224826367-Automated-Troubleshooting-Hextech-Repair-Tool) for Mac. Once you've installed it try a \"Force Repatch\", if that doesn't work then try a clean reinstall through the Hextech Repair Tool.\n\n\n* **Bootcamp**\nBootcamp allows you to run both windows and macOS on your mac (you can switch between the operating systems on start up). It should be fairly easy to set up, and from what I've heard online running windows from bootcamp seems to work well for League. I'm pretty confident this will work, but not certain. Unfortunately you're going to need to pay for a copy of windows 10 to do this, you can find a cheap one [here](https://www.empiregaming.com/en_au/windows-10-home-32-64-bit.html).\n\nTry the first 4 options. **I don't recommend you try Bootcamp yet** until we get some input from some of the Wrenchmen. Personally I wouldn't try bootcamp until the problem persists for a few patches. But if you want to try Bootcamp add me on discord (Tele#0343) and I can take you through it.","replies":[{"poster":"NeonMist","date":"2018-11-19T09:37:34.490+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hi, thank you so much for your help, I can tell you went to a lot of effort and I'm so grateful! I decided to go straight to the Hextech repair tool but unfortunately it didn't work properly. I did something that interrupted the clean reinstall too, so the game was deleted but not reinstalled. I'm currently reinstalling it from the website so we'll see how that goes. As for the other suggestions, I don't have Time Machine set up, but should probably do that some time, considering I've had two macs for 4 years now...I'm not even willing to touch bootcamp. I have enough things go wrong on a mac, I avoid PCs at all costs (except work but that's what swearing was invented for). Thanks again! I'll update the thread soon :)","replies":[{"poster":"Tele","date":"2018-11-19T10:10:40.750+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Best of luck!

I'm not sure what's up with the FPS though, it never went over 60 before but now it goes above 100? that's new, and it doesn't seem that different. But either way I can still play even if it's a bit slow. Thanks!","replies":[{"poster":"Tele","date":"2018-11-22T00:52:08.405+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Nice! Glad we could help. You probably already know this but I'll let you know just in case; Apple announced that macOS Mojave will be the last operating system to support 32 bit programs. So don't update your macOS under any circumstances until you're sure LoL has a 64 bit mac version! If you upgrade and there's no 64 bit version, there's nothing we'll be able to do to help (other than Bootcamp).","replies":[{"poster":"NeonMist","date":"2018-11-28T08:58:01.747+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Interesting issue I'm still having - can't use any kind of voice chat (league chat, discord etc) while league is open or the sound coming from both the client and the game is really bad. If I don't use any of these it sounds normal. It's a strange issue but I can't find anything suggesting anyone else has had this problem.","replies":[{"poster":"Tele","date":"2018-12-03T02:22:02.177+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Oh sorry for the late reply, I was really busy this week! \n\nDon't worry, no working microphone is a known issue with League on macOS Mojave. See [this post](https://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/bug-report/AZhJrEVr-mic-not-working-on-voice-chat-with-macbook-pro-and-os-mojave) for other people with the same issue as you. \n\nBasically the problem is that Majove is very secure so it's forcing League to have permission before it can use the microphone, but League hasn't been updated to properly ask the operating system permission. As far as I know there's no fix for this yet. Riot will just have to update League at some point so that it properly asks the operating system for permission to use the microphone.\n\nSorry we couldn't help here :(","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"NeonMist","date":"2018-11-22T05:32:40.965+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yeah I read that about Mojave I absolutely won't be upgrading until there's a 64 bit version (if ever) because I SO don't want to run bootcamp!","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"QAPLA","date":"2018-11-18T22:48:46.212+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Can't you emulate windows on a Mac and run it through that?","replies":[]},{"poster":"Stince","date":"2018-11-18T08:03:44.368+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Isn't there a 64 bit version anyways...
