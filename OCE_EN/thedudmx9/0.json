A freely shared account will not typically face any recourse, but if it is compromised (accessed without permission) and banned as a result, it cannot be recovered since the person semi-legitimately using the account is not the original owner.\n\nRank also plays a factor here. If your friend was Diamond and you are Bronze or visa versa, and you are playing ranked games on that account, it can be problematic. Even if you are close in rank to the person who has shared their account with you, in no way can I recommend touching ranked if you want to protect the account.\n\nAll that aside, without more information on the circumstances the most we can do is speculate, so the specifics are probably something you should take up with support: https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/requests/new\n\nWith the original owner's help, you *may* be able to recover the account, strongly subject to the specifics of the sharing and the specifics of why the account was banned.","replies":[{"poster":"thedudmx9","date":"2019-05-08T11:45:56.851+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"?","replies":[{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2019-05-08T13:07:37.340+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It's pretty much up to the discretion of player support.
