But this is the second time this season you have taken away my silver border. The first one was just the bug and last patch I got my silver border back which I earned form last season. And now it is gone again. It took me 4 years to get to silver and my reward for it was an icon and the silver border loading screen, I&#039;d like it back. And if you have changed your policy so that borders reflect current rank, then my question to you is why the fk did I even get the reward then if you were only going to take it away from me. Thanks for your time, and good luck with taming the toxic kids =)","replies":[{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2019-02-13T09:54:34.720+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Past season rank now shows on your banner instead of your border, so when you flip the loading screen tiles you'll see your banner with your past season rank, as well as those of your teammates (you can't see enemy ranks).\n\nIt also still shows on your profile. So it does still show on the loading screen, just not 'front page'.","replies":[{"poster":"The Mark Show","date":"2019-02-13T10:08:14.532+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"should be front page, people shouldn't have to search to see my glory, lol","replies":[{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2019-02-13T12:31:59.708+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"In my mind, it's kinda 6 of 1, half a dozen of the other type deal. On the one hand, it's historically been a ranked reward that people cared quite a bit about, but on the other, it doesn't really reflect any valuable information, it's just style points. \n\nFrom a logical perspective, I think the new way is better, but from a sentimental one, I'm not sure how to feel. I've always either maintained or raised my rank, so it doesn't affect me personally, but I can respect the diverse situations which would warrant a desire for better recognition of past achievements.\n\nI do seem to recall them mentioning something about adding all past season ranks to profile? Though I may be mixing memories there.","replies":[]}]}]}]}
