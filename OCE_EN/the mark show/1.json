I wasn&#039;t going to care about putting in a request but it was bugging me and it took me 4 years to get out of bronze to get to silver so I want what little I have earned. Thanks for listening to my request, and best of luck with keeping this game alive =)","replies":[{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2019-01-28T10:26:53.233+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"https://mobile.twitter.com/RiotSapMagic/status/1088570277502414849","replies":[{"poster":"The Mark Show","date":"2019-01-28T12:08:25.524+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thanks for the info, its nice to know its being fixed at some point =)","replies":[]}]}]}
