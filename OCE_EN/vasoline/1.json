Frost queens is most efficient (provided you are actually getting the hits off) and talisman is pretty useless as you rely solely on passive gold (love the active though). \n[You can read more about gold efficiency here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1ASPk9DIQug-3x7d2ZZ5PU7c7-NiE9Tj5q3MgeIYZoc4/edit#gid=2147374466)\n\nWhile the other items don't have that specific limitation, they both have their downfalls. spellthiefs and frostfang both disable for 30s after you kill a minion (really annoying when you are playing poke supports that do tonnes of damage and you can't necessarily control the minion wave).\nTalisman and all of its components aren't gold efficient at all, but are best when you want to play somewhat passively and want a bit of a speed boost. \n\nIt is incredibly frustrating trying to get your stacks off as a tanky support, only to have your team decimate the wave before you are even half way through your AA animation. Just type in chat saying you need to get your stacks off. \nIMO,  in the late game it is usually more efficient to sell your support item (exception of frost queens claim and completely reliant on team comp situation) to buy something to tank you up a bit or provide more utility for your team.","replies":[]}]}
