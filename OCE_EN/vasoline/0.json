Grasp of the undying is complete bs with 4 s cd and scales off  max health so is most beneficial for tanks.  \r\nAnother major problem is iceborn gauntlet  which gives great cd , health and armor .  It is even being abused by  assassins now such as ekko and fizz and others are starting to appear.\r\n\r\nThe proposed nerfs in the patch 6.8 are pretty minimal and are unlikely to have much  impact . \r\nWhen full tank builds can put out more damage than adc s there is something wrong.","replies":[{"poster":"BarryButcher","date":"2016-04-19T01:45:32.340+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"They nerfed grasp by .5% in the next patch and nerfed iceborn passive damage a little. They aren't going to repeat the mistakes of the past few nerfs (like Hecarim) and gut a champion with heavy handed nerfs.\n\nHonestly they need to nerf Sunfires stats since it is pretty much the superior choice compared to Deadmans when they both provide the same raw stats.\n\nThe fact that Tank Fizz, Tank Yasuo and Tank Akali are extemely viable is kind of ridiculous. I'm all for \"breaking the meta\" but when they can 1v4 get a triple kill and live, its a bit much.","replies":[]},{"poster":"JasonWazza","date":"2016-04-19T00:50:39.538+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I find it funny how everyone complains about Iceborn and not the two other items in every one of the builds.\n\nIt's not just iceborn that's the problem it's the fact that the item combination (Iceborn, Sunfire, Visage) are extremely strong right now (I say right now, they have been strong since the changes to the things like 6+ patches ago people are just picking it up in the last 2 patches.)\n\nThis item combination gives you everything you need, a Slow, Physical damage, Magical damage, Armor, MR, 30% CDR.\n\nBasically any champion that can spam some sort of mobility spell (Irelia, Fizz, Ekko being the main culprits, but champs like Nidalee can pull this off as well) can use this and do really well because that's all you need, is some minor sticking power and you will be stuck on them.","replies":[]}]}
