You can revert any time and will not get banned.\r\n\r\n1. Download and install Wooxy (This will allow you to install particles). http://www.mediafire.com/download/76jy2m0u28tv5ts/WooxySetup_1_1_0_0.zip\r\n\r\n2. Download new Yasuo particles and extract to desktop: http://www.mediafire.com/download/905ny4hmyb58g25/Yasuo+Particle+Fix.rar\r\n\r\n3. Open Wooxy\r\n\r\n4. Click &quot;Skins&quot; &gt; &quot;Import Skin&quot; &gt; &quot;Add a Folder&quot; and select the &quot;Yasuo Particle Fix&quot; folder which you downloaded. \r\n\r\n5. If a box comes up click &quot;Do not add these files&quot; to all. After that hit &quot;Save the skin&quot; and name it whatever you like.\r\n\r\n6. You will now see the skin added. Click on it and hit &quot;Install&quot;\r\n\r\n7. That&#039;s it! Open league and you will have the particles once more!\r\n\r\nIf you have any questions, need help or would request me to change something feel free to ask! I will try my best! :)","replies":[{"poster":"DragonOfTheVoid","date":"2015-10-28T02:36:28.543+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"is that the thing were you just see a black block","replies":[{"poster":"Ekrah","date":"2015-10-28T02:59:04.613+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Black block?","replies":[{"poster":"DragonOfTheVoid","date":"2015-10-28T04:01:23.920+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"when I q or e on yas instead of the blade or wall I just get a black block","replies":[]}]}]}]}
