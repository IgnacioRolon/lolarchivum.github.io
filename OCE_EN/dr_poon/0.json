Preferred champs for support include thresh, I am second to none on the chainz, morgana (ezmode), and malphite. My adc pool consists of caitlyn, jinx, kalista, and lucian. However my limited mechanical ability on other adc's are compensated for by my runes which ensure I can outcrit them, thus negating any need for mechanics. Recruit me and we will go far.","replies":[{"poster":"Zero Infinity","date":"2014-11-30T10:21:17.852+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Sorry, gingers only.","replies":[{"poster":"Dr Poon","date":"2014-11-30T10:44:29.633+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Damnit man, I CAN CHANGE.","replies":[{"poster":"KingDinger","date":"2014-12-02T05:10:06.693+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"mere is a gril.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Kenyen","date":"2014-12-01T22:57:16.942+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Oi im bronze 3 and I joined main mid","replies":[]}]}
