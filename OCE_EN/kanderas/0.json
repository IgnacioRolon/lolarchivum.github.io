My firewall is off, I&#039;ve cleared the registry, flushed the DNS, and I&#039;m running the game as administrator. There&#039;s nothing wrong with my network settings because my flatmate is playing URF right now while I&#039;m stuck here sitting at my computer trying to figure out how to fix the problem. I&#039;ve removed the game and restored it using my flatmate&#039;s working copy, and I still get the same RADS error. Which clearly suggests something other than the game&#039;s actual files (hence I cleansed the registry in case of old files or references).\r\n\r\nThe only thing I have going for me, is that I&#039;m reasonably certain what created this issue. I was patching the game the other week (before which it had been working fine), but my laptop ran out of battery and the computer shut off, interrupting the patching process. I couldn&#039;t be bothered doing anything then, because I expected to have to repatch, but this issue has come up instead. So is there any handy solutions to this RADS issue?","replies":[{"poster":"HORSE OF FORCE","date":"2015-04-06T01:17:36.563+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"If you've (effectively) reinstalled the game, then your laptop shutting off prematurely wouldn't have an effect on anything.\n\nWhat you can do is try [using an alternative DNS](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues#wq5) altogether.","replies":[]}]}
