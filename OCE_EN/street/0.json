I Have experience playing with, and shot calling for,  ranked teams previously from silver rated teams to gold teams. I am either looking to join a team or create a team with myself as the shot caller or until we decide someone is better suited for the role.\n\nMy strong point is decision making as I&#039;ve managed to watch every lcs game since it began and even the majority of the tournaments prior to it&#039;s creation. I was gold 1 last season and managed to get to plat 5 in the start of the season but have now been demoted due to inactivity (have screen shot)\n\nAs I have been playing on and off since season 1 I have a very diverse champion pool but my strongest for each role is as follows\n\nTOP:\n{{champion:98}} {{champion:57}} {{champion:24}} {{champion:75}} {{champion:58}} {{champion:102}} {{champion:48}}  {{champion:150}} {{champion:36}} \nStrong split pusher and teleporter\nPreferably tank champions\n\nJungle:\n{{champion:107}} {{champion:421}} {{champion:76}} {{champion:59}}{{champion:102}} {{champion:20}} \nProbably my strongest role even though it may seem like then smallest champion pool. This is because I believe jungle is more about having one strong champion to fulfill each role. Whether that be early game pressure; pick comps or engage/peel. I feel as if this position best allows for my decisions making to come through\nVery strong on Rengar\n\n\nMID:\n{{champion:238}} {{champion:101}} {{champion:157}} {{champion:81}}{{champion:4}} {{champion:80}} {{champion:30}} \nRoaming assassins with xerath being my go to team fight champion followed\nZed is undoubtedly my strongest mid laner and possibly my strongest champion over all.\n\n\nI currently am a bit out of form as I haven&#039;t played try hard in around 10 weeks but feel as if I can pick it up again quickly.\n\nIf anyone is interested in more info add my IGN and feel free to ask :)\n\n\nEDIT: My friend who is very strong in communication with me is also looking for a team\nHe is an ADC main and jungle is his fall back position\n\nEDIT 2: Best off looking at my last seasons stats as I haven't played seriously at all this season :)\n\nEDIT 3: Started playing solo que again and am back in plat","replies":[{"poster":"Rattykumar","date":"2015-04-09T10:00:36.395+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I am a gold 2 jungler :D","replies":[{"poster":"Street","date":"2015-04-09T10:07:25.804+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Awesome, maybe we can look into building a team :)","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Street","date":"2015-04-17T00:03:42.946+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Sorry guys, looking for at least high gold","replies":[]},{"poster":"Zaim","date":"2015-04-12T12:16:30.886+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Ay man, I'm looking to join a ranked team, I'm currently in Bronze 3 and want to climb but with a team that isn't salty or toxic.
