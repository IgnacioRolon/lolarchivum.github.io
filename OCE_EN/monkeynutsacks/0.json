Why you shouldn't buy RP.","subforum":"Help & Support (OCE)","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"&quot;http://forums.na.leagueoflegends.com/board/showthread.php?t=4572524&quot;\r\nWith the update of one of my favorite champs Karthus a Nasty New Policy was adopted by Riot Games. A Policy that serves only to Screw over Veteran Players. A policy that would breach Australian Consumer rights, that if adopted in any store in AUS/NZ Would face lawsuits. A similar policy saw Valve Sewed by the ACCC.\r\nI&#039;m talking about the &quot;NO REFUND FOR CHAMPION REWORKS/RE-RELEASE UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCE&quot; policy.\r\nWhen Sion was released, I hated the changes. I liked the AP juggernaut that healed his allies while yelling Arny references, Not the Grape man that all you hear is &quot;ARGGHGHGJGJGKKKKK&quot;.\r\n\r\nSo like I had done when I was dissatisfied with another champions rework in the past, I went to support to request a refund on the Warmonger Sion Skin. In response to my request All I received was a blanket message, that provided links to this new Policy &quot;http://forums.na.leagueoflegends.com/board/showthread.php?t=4572524&quot;\r\nIn response I addressed the following issues with this new Policy.\r\n- I made my purchase before the policy change.\r\n- If any indication that these changes would occur to the Item, I never would of made my purchase\r\n- I had used my all my refund tokens well over a year prior to the Policy/Sion change\r\n- That available information on Refund Tokens stated that Refund tokens where meant to be used if I made an accidental purchase/ Came to regret a purchase (If I made a Mistake, NOT FOR CHAMPION REWORKS/RE-RELEASES), and that I had used my refunds tokens as instructed by Riot games Well prior to the policy change.\r\n- That working on &quot;transparency&quot; for champion updates now is all well and good, but this doesn&#039;t help players who made their purchase so long ago.\r\n- If a veteran player had purchased more than three skins for champions that had been updated, It would be impossible for them to refund.\r\n- I addressed how such policies do not align with Australian Consumer Rights.\r\n\r\nI went into great detail of several requests and months. I addressed and argued every point the Support put forward. But they never addressed these points. All they would send in response was more blanket mail, and that I and every other player Should just get used to it.\r\n\r\nI asked Support several times to please for once read my Requests, as far as I can tell all they do is read the first line then send blanket mail. I asked support for a contact phone number, they did not address this. I asked several times to be put through to someone higher/ a manager, They did not address this. I asked for an address to send a formal letter to, they did not address this.\r\n\r\nThis policy only serves to Disadvantage Paying players. I find it hard to believe that any consumer would accept and support this policy. \r\n\r\nRiot games Hides behind their Bull**** Support system as it blindly scams us.\r\n\r\nI used to have faith in Riot games, Every issue I had they addressed and assisted me, Even when it came to refunds. I felt satisfied and secure with every purchase, and had every intent of purchasing more items and had encouraged many of my friends to play who also then made purchases.\r\nNow they screw me over 975rp, a small piece of my total purchases. \r\nI&#039;ve pleaded and made every attempt to reason with support, But all they do is continue to disrespect me and treat me like an idiot.\r\n\r\nUntil this policy is changed, and Riot Games Decides to do right by their consumers I will make no further purchases. I have convinced all my friends to do the same. and I encourage all of you to do the same.\r\n\r\n\r\nP.S. The only thing Support actually did for me, was that they attacked and disabled my account until I comply with a name change. This only happened after my last Request. They stated that it was due to a community decision, Though it would of been impossible for a player to report me due to me not playing any matches on this account for some time. IT WAS someone from support, who probably didn&#039;t like that I wouldn&#039;t drop this.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ntl;dr Read it you lazy bum, its important. :/","replies":[{"poster":"Only Heimer","date":"2015-08-16T19:11:47.974+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"you realise you don't actually own your account or anything on it right? when you buy a skin you're actually just buying access to it, not ownership of it. as riot owns everything they can take it all away from you whenever they want such as when you get banned or if they were to ever shut the game down or, like in this case, make changes/upgrades to the game. it clearly states all this in their ToS.\n\nyou bought access to a skin at the time, and now the champion has changed. you don't like the new champion? that's just too bad mate. if they were to refund you it would just be good will, not because they're legally obligated to.","replies":[{"poster":"bapitixo","date":"2015-08-16T21:58:50.486+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"This may be true in regards to the \"borrowing\".. however if his purchase was before this policy change (which, indeed will screw over alot of players) it does breach the ACCC laws, wether or not the account and as such, the skins are \"borrowed\" or not.. a purchase was made with the intention of permanent \"borrowing\", and because of re-works the skin is no longer available or something? I haven't really looked into that or anything, but i'm guessing this is the case otherwise it wouldn't make sense.\n\nHowever they ARE legally obligated to refund the amount of the skin purchase due to this change even with the policy and all this \"borrowing\" under-handed crap. They can change all the policies they like, the fact remains it's an integral part of the ACCC laws and are enforceable by law.\n\nNote: If for example the game closed and all these people asked for refunds, they would obviously be denied as that's just not going to happen when the case is reviewed, that would be idiotic. However in this case, it would be accepted and plausible.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"bapitixo","date":"2015-08-16T12:41:38.317+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Well you really should have expected this sort of thing from Riot typical typical Riot, if it indeed breaches policies of the ACCC well they have pretty much shot themselves in the foot, hooray for the pain in the ass policies of the ACCC, I would more than likely print out the emails and responses you received with your replies and such, as well as dates for purchases made and re-release dates etc and then probably talk to the ombudsman in your area about the matter, giving all related information as stated previously. (Unless of course he is useless, then try a different state)\n\nThis has always been a go-to when it comes to companies like Riot, refusing to do what they are required to do by law and are enforced by organisations like the ACCC. As such, if you, like every other LoL player is sick to heck of the joke of a support system, go down this road and i'm sure you will find a satisfactory solution as long as you keep up to track with it.. Who knows if they refuse further then a lawsuit is something very real, of which if the infringements you briefly described and the situation IS as you stated, and they will lose out on alot more than just 975RP worth.\n\nSide Note: If you choose the lawsuit, You'll become rich and all your dreams will come true :P and they'll get a huge pole shoved up their ass like they deserve with the useless support system they have. The ACCC is not something to be underestimated and for situations like this can be a very powerful ally, especially with specific laws and regulations being pointed out by the ombudsman who is more of less a specialist in these sorts of situations.\n\nWhy do i say all this? Experience, i've done this quite a few times when it came to having laws infringed with me being the victim and i'm not the type to just let that sort of thing slide. And Riot certainly deserves a kick in the ass with the lack of concern they have for support issues.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Only Heimer","date":"2015-08-17T17:51:51.789+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"but there is every indication that things can and will change. first of all, it's pretty unreasonable to not expect something like a video game to be updated and changed over time. secondly, they tell you that they can change things and you agreed to it.\n\nwhat if they one day decide to completely overhaul the game and use a different engine? do you think then you would be entitled to a refund on everything because the game and all the champions/skins look different? what about when they nerf champions in different patches? are you then entitled to a refund because its different to when you purchased it in a previous patch and no longer enjoy playing it?\n\nwhen you purchase a skin you're purchasing access to certain game files that are owned by riot and these files can be changed. you purchased the right to use THEIR warmonger skin/theme while playing a match using the champion sion.  it's not a tangible item that you purchased and now belongs to you.\n\ni suggest you visit http://oce.leagueoflegends.com/en/legal/termsofuse. all the important stuff when it comes to ownership and virtual items/RP is in ALL CAPS.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Only Heimer","date":"2015-08-17T01:57:00.587+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"yeah find me a corporation that doesn't screw people to turn a profit.\n\nim not saying they shouldn't refund you out of good will (i think they used to for visual updates/reworks but their excuse now is it would take up too much time for support), but i find it hard to believe it would have any weight legally. all the ACCC stuff you listed would apply to you receiving a refund because the skin is \"faulty\" or nothing like it was promised/advertised and i bet you riot would immediately refund people who purchased a skin that was majorly bugged or something. not just RP, but also a monetary refund if people wanted it.\n\n \"You can ask for a replacement or refund if the problem with the product is major.\" - Key words are problem and major. Not liking the updated champion doesn't make the skin suddenly have a major problem. the word problem in this context would mean a fault of some kind or is just simply not what is advertised.\n\n\"it has a problem that would have stopped someone from buying it if they’d known about it\" - again there is no problem with the product. \n\"it is unsafe\" - obviously this doesn't apply here.\n\"it is significantly different from the sample or description\" - well there are skins that don't look as good as the artwork but good luck arguing that it is significant enough. besides i don't think this is your grievance anyway. it's that the champion is now different and you don't like it anymore.\n\"it doesn’t do what the business said it would, or what you asked for and can’t easily be fixed.\" - no. it's a skin and it does exactly what it's supposed to.\n\n\"It is against the law for businesses to tell you or show signs stating that they do not give refunds under any circumstances, including for gifts and during sales.\" - Riot has never stated that they do not give refunds under any circumstances. Like i already said, if there was a major problem with something, they would. Businesses have every right to refuse giving refunds for simply no longer liking it and regretting the purchase. Many do allow it though out of good will or more likely they give you store credit so you can buy something else. Riot does this somewhat by giving you 3 refunds per account. They refund you the RP which is store credit. they didn't need to do that.\n\nas i've already said, you don't own the game or anything in it. you agreed to their ToS which clearly states that they can make any changes to the game whenever they want, which includes champions and skins. they have no legal obligation to refund you because you don't like the change.","replies":[{"poster":"bapitixo","date":"2015-08-17T03:30:44.467+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"If the entire purpose of this thread was that he simply didn't like the skin itself, then yes i agree with you.. wouldn't make sense nor would it have any weight legally or.. well in any way, that's just stupid.. I believe i stated that in my reply to your comment. \n\nI also am unsure of which is the facts, wether due to the new re-works the skins paid for previously are no longer available, or if they don't like the re-work and want a refund for the skin.. i was basing my comments on the prior (skins no longer being available due to re-work/update.. whatever)\n\nAnd in the link the OP posted, they have stated they wouldn't process refund requests: \"we've decided that beginning with the Karthus champion update, we will stop processing refund requests for updated champions\".\n\nYes, noone with an account owns the game or anything in it but we paid to \"borrow\" these things, if due to disabling of such things (in this case skins)  due to a rework of a champion and rito was too lazy to update the skins and allow the users who have bought a champion skin previously to then use these updated skins.. well then that's in breach of the ACCC laws more-so that if the user was made aware of this loophole, they wouldn't have made the purchase in the first place. Anything an individual agrees to will be over-ruled by the governing laws when it comes to monetary transactions, IF the situation is plausible enough, nothing petty. Because not everyone reads the fine-print. Not Riot's fault for this, not saying it is, but it will be over-ruled by the laws of the country. That's just how it is.\n\nAs i said, unless it's simply a case of disliking the re-work and wanting a refund for the skin.. well that's not good enough and i agree with what you are saying, however if the skins are being disabled due to the re-work and or discontinued due to the re-work then that is good enough for a refund. wether that simply be RP or the monetary value.","replies":[{"poster":"Only Heimer","date":"2015-08-17T03:50:42.411+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=bapitixo,realm=OCE,application-id=ElA0rvVL,discussion-id=00goabVu,comment-id=00030000,timestamp=2015-08-17T03:30:44.467+0000)\n>\n> If the entire purpose of this thread was that he simply didn't like the skin itself, then yes i agree with you.. wouldn't make sense nor would it have any weight legally or.. well in any way, that's just stupid..
