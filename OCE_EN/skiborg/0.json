When she hits 6, 11 and 16 she gains armor and he fists gain bulk (such as the red spikes at the back) and maybe she gains a helmet at 16. This would a really cool skin that i think most die hard and even new Vi player would really enjoy and be proud to use. The move \"Denting Blows\" could be changed to look futuristic (like Mecha Kha'Zix's isolated target indicator) and her \"Excessive Force\" could leave a red or white AOE behind it depending on here level. Her \"Vault Breaker\" leaves behind a faint mist and the charge up could make her fists armor plating lock together while shes charging the ability. Which brings us to her ultimate \"Assault and Battery\" where she charges with either both arms behind her or just one (in her usual style) and when she reaches her target she is pushed up by a hexagon (or any shape, hexagons just work best) like Aatrox's \"Dark Flight\". Her saying could include thing son evolution such as \"I was made to shut you down\"(taunt or after/before ult) and \"I have evolved to become.. Vi-tech, haha\" as her joke. \nI hope this becomes an idea Riot can take up because as i said so many people would think it it is a wicked skin.\nPlease feel free to leave comments and ideas.\nThanks, \nSkiBorg","replies":[]}
