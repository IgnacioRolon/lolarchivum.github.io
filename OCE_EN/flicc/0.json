Like the bat is a multiple of his height.  Apply the same multiple to your height and BAM correctly proportioned bat.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2016-02-11T01:56:41.975+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Mmm your best bet would probably to take a look at his model in comparison to other human champs that they have done size tweaks on. I think MF was one of them. You could also look at the Academy splash art since it's shared, and if you assume Darius is fairly tall then you might be able to get a decent comparison off.\n\nHe seems to me to be depicted as about 16-17yo so assuming he's not super tall (which he doesn't appear to be), he's probably 160-170cm ish. That's be my best guess anyway.","replies":[{"poster":"Flicc","date":"2016-02-12T03:08:55.359+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"so i figured out his height by comparing it to riven and riven is 5'9 ... and he is 5'8 cause i compared photos 3d figures etc. 5'8 is  172cm or 1.72metres . and i did some editing stuff and i still dont know the size of the bat but that is fine beacause i need to to fit my body not ekko's if you get what i mean. if its up to his shoulder ill make it up to my shoulder. get it? idk i know what i have to do now at least haha thank you thought","replies":[{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2016-02-12T05:45:26.663+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":":) Glad you got it all worked out!

So ekko's models would be bigger than ekko himself\n\nIn comparison so ekko, his bat is just under his shoulders, so your cosplay should have the bat being slightly lower than your shoulders ","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Lord Kylar Alice","date":"2016-02-11T03:40:18.890+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Not very.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Deep Terror Nami","date":"2016-02-11T02:06:20.150+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"It's not that big.\n\nIt's kind of...\n\n...minute!","replies":[{"poster":"Icarus1314","date":"2016-02-11T10:29:32.112+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"where is my like button \n{{sticker:slayer-pantheon-thumbs}}","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Icarus1314","date":"2016-02-11T10:28:31.971+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"hahahahahaah cricket bat~~\nwhat has been seen can not be unseen XD\nthanks a lot mate","replies":[{"poster":"Flicc","date":"2016-02-12T01:35:18.738+0000","up_votes":0,"down_votes":0,"body":"i forgot to mention i was cosplaying ACADEMY ekko cause he uses a cricket bat haha my bad","replies":[{"poster":"Icarus1314","date":"2016-02-12T10:49:06.817+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"*pressing like button*\n{{sticker:slayer-pantheon-thumbs}}","replies":[]}]}]}]}
