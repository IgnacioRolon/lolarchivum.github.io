Yes a couple of high ellos here and there but playable cause they were silver 2 or gold 3 higher. But now that im in silver 3 please explain to me all the plat and diamonds in my games???? if im correct if they have a plat player on there team i should have a equal teammate as his laner. But nah this is plat going up against bronze. and this didnt happen once but 3 times already, and i notice something very interesting threw these games. the higher ranks were always duo. I dont see how this is fair and would like riot to fix this bullsh*t.","replies":[{"poster":"Ingénue","date":"2019-02-21T10:24:33.495+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Is this soloq?
