It looks like there is a hard coded link in the launcher for OCE to the \"Documents\" folder on the C drive rather than using the environment variable which is being passed to flash for some reason. I assume adobe air is involved as well. I don't keep my documents there, I moved the documents folder to a network drive so that I can access them from all my computers and use offline files to sync it.\n\nI set it back to default and lol works again. I moved the documents folder to a different drive and it stopped working again.\n\nI assume it's a bug in the launcher since this was only affecting OCE and not NA or EU.
