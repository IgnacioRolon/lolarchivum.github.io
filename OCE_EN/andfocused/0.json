Well I have been and NOTHING HAS BEEN DONE.\r\n\r\nThere is a player with the summoner name &quot;TSM Ezreal&quot; on the OCE server who is using scripts on Kog&#039;Maw. He goes around in his 4/5 man dynamic queue with the same people and continues to use scripts, ruining the game.\r\n\r\nI&#039;m sure RIOT  has their own ways of dealing with this in terms of checking whether he is or not so I&#039;m not going to bother with video proof which people can debate. This is because I&#039;m so confident that if RIOT takes 5 minutes to look into this player they will be able to tell he is scripting.\r\n\r\n Can something PLEASE be done about this so that I don&#039;t have more games of running into this same guy (its OCE at diamond level, so you see a lot of the same people).\r\n\r\nOr is using third party software which controls the movement of your character allowed now? If so, I didn&#039;t get the memo.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSincerely \r\nA salty member of the OCE community.","replies":[{"poster":"Requiemsfire","date":"2016-04-28T16:45:03.653+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"You mean doing something that effectively breaks the rules of the forums causing your thread to be taken down is a sign of action not being taken against rule breaking?{{summoner:4}}","replies":[]},{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2016-04-28T08:36:13.201+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":1,"body":"> A POST SIMILAR TO THIS WAS TAKEN DOWN, WHICH MEANS THAT A RIOT STAFF MEMBER SAW IT AND TOOK NO ACTION AS THE EXACT SAME THING HAPPENED TODAY\n\nThe post was taken down because there is a no name and shame policy on the boards, and as I believe was mentioned on the original post, support is a better place to take that information.
