It&#039;s fine if it&#039;s 5min at first, but then it should escalate if your average number of dodges per games played rises above a set level.\r\n\r\n**Thoughts / Opinions?**","replies":[{"poster":"Fizz Mortune","date":"2018-05-08T06:23:45.265+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"You must be picking some troll as shit to get that many dodges.

I swear I've seen some longer than that, but I could be wrong.\nEither way, I don't see the issue with someone dodging? They're simply unhappy with the role they're given or that their desired champ has been banned so they decided that instead of having a bad game they'd prefer to wait a few minutes in hopes to get their desired position and champion to have an enjoyable match.\nI find it quite hard to believe that you were in queue for more than an hour and a half. I presume you were playing summoners rift ranked with the wait time being approx. 3 minutes before a match was found.\n\nLike @Fizz Mortune said, you must have been picking something quite odd to have that many dodges. If that isn't the reason then you must be quite the unlucky person or the fact that you're in silver.","replies":[]}]}
