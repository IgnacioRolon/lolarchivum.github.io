And if you want real life examples, there ARE certain words that can get you fired from your job at the first usage.\n\nnot sure how any of this is relevant to anything. again, the whole real life thing is due to someone else using an idiotic real life example. perhaps you should actually be aware of who is replying to who before making judgements. but in response to that, someone getting fired for the use of a word, regardless of context, and also if the employee has years of good service is 1 not appropriate, 2 not legal.","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Edward Thatch","date":"2017-11-12T07:16:14.093+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"Well said","replies":[]},{"poster":"LAKIGR","date":"2017-11-12T09:21:10.989+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":3,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Lebron Games,realm=OCE,application-id=T8eq2lFQ,discussion-id=xKQmEM5r,comment-id=00010000000000000001,timestamp=2017-11-12T06:57:51.579+0000)\n>\n> we&#x27;re talking about chat offenses in a video game. you&#x27;re trying to compare it to bank robbery which is considered an extreme crime. if you&#x27;re going to compare it to RL then compare it to something similar. like traffic offenses and minor crimes. i think you&#x27;ll see in the courts they generally are not going to give you max penalty straight away if you are generally a law abiding citizen but they will for reoccurring offenses.\n> \n> lets say u got really annoyed with someone and randomly sperged out and pushed them (out of character for you) and they called the cops. are you saying you deserve and should be imprisoned for 2 years which is the actual maximum sentence for common assault when you have 0 priors and have been a law abiding citizen for decades?\n> \n> funny how your argument is actually helping prove mine....\n\nHere’s the thing though I’m assuming that this isn’t his first offence since generally 9 times out of 10 the guys that make these post are lying.

I used to always think \"oh fuck off you got banned after going through 3 punishment tiers so it is your own fault and  you deserve it\".\n\nLet me be absolutely clear here: I did not go through 3 punishment tiers. I went straight to tier 3.\n\nIn the interest of full disclosure I had a chat restriction toward the end of S5 (I was getting pretty salty with people trolling at season end) but there was >12m between that and my tier 3 so the impact of the first restriction would have decayed long before I got the 2nd.\n\ngenuine question, but do you take \"fuck yourself\" to literally mean that you have to find the flexibility to do it, or is it just a general insult? Serious question. What about \"go jump\". Does getting called a \"loser\" have any quantifiable basis or do you just see it as general banter? Neck yourself is slang, albeit for a fairly unsavoury act, but clearly not a serious request for someone to kill themselves. like I said, if someone on an internet game saying \"neck yourself\" is the trigger for an actual suicide, the person has issues that are well beyond the insults they receive that needs professional intervention and the avoidance of any triggers, such as online competitive games, news and current events or social media (its real - look it up) because the salt is absolutely there. \n\nWhat is the example that is set? Salt in competitive games is hardly surprising when our national heroes in Australia, the sports men and women, make a sport out of sledging and when the likes of connor mcgregor and floyd mayweather sledge the sh!t out of each other in public to increase PPV profits. While our professional sportsmen and women do this, it will always be an element of online gaming. Riot did the absolute right thing with a mute button because it empowers the player to determine who they have to listen to.\n\nYes the system is automated, but that is where player behaviour specialists come in. They weren't interested in the slightest and also took other stuff in the conversation out of context (someone on the other team said %%%% in place of \"good\" but it seemed like a deliberate insult - I queried the player because I find racism pretty offensive and it seems the auto text picked that up as something I had said.

It seems like **Riot** has been pumping out a plethora of bans recently. Personally, I don't think what you said was _too_ harsh and I agree that a chat restriction is far more appropreate but context is always the deciding factor is properly judging someone for being toxic. Were you provoked by another player or were you both engaging in some playful banter?\n\nEither way, my advice to you now is when that 14 day ban expires don't say anything that is remotly inflamintory or negative or do anything that is likely to get you reported. As, I was in your postion not that long ago, I got a 14 day ban, when it ended I played 1 match and was a bit negative towards one player (the entire team was infact however I doubt any of them got punished like I did.) and when I was in que for another game, boom. Permaban. \nSo I highly recommend being careful now that you have recieve that 14 day ban.","replies":[]}]}
