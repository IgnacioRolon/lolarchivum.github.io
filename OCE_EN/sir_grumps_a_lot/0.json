To troubleshoot this issue, we'll go down the potential solutions for both potential network issues and game issues. Starting with network issues, please make sure that you've done the following (taken from the [**Troubleshooting Connection Issues**](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues) Riot Games Support article): \n\n1. Switch to a wired (ethernet) connection. Wireless connections may be weak or have interference, causing a disruption and preventing a stable internet connection to the League of Legends servers. \n2. Disable any firewalls and/or antivirus applications that you may have running. These firewalls may block outbound and inbound League of Legends connections, causing some serious problems and preventing you from getting on the Rift! For help disabling your firewall(s), check out [**this article**](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues#wq3).\n3. Disable IPv6, as the League of Legends client is designed to work with IPv4. For help disabling IPv6, check out [**this article**](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues#wq4).\n4. Configure your DNS to use a public Domain Name System. For help configuring your DNS settings, check out [**this article**](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues#wq5).\n5. If possible, try port forwarding the League of Legends ports. For a list of the ports that League of Legends uses and more information on how to set up port forwarding, check out [**this article**](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues#wq8).\n6. Check for VPN and proxy usage. If necessary, [**reset your Internet Explorer settings**](http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/internet-explorer/reset-ie-settings). \n7. Disable IP Helper. To do this, open the start menu, search \"services\", and select \"Services.msc\" or \"Services\" (depending on operating system). Locate IP Helper, right-click on it, and select \"Properties\". On the properties page, select \"Startup type\" and select \"Disable\". Under \"Service status\", click on \"Stop\" and then apply the settings. \n8. Now, lastly, [**flush your DNS and release/renew IP**](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues#wq10). \n\nIf the black screen issue persists even after the connection troubleshooting, the issue may lay with the game. Let's get to work! \n\n1. First things first, let's try a client repair. If you're not sure how to repair your client, check out [**this step-by step picture guide**](http://www.wrenchmen.org/resources/knowledgebase/1?view=article)! \n2. Run a [**Windows Update**](http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-vista/install-windows-updates). (DirectX updates may appear here if it's not up to date)\n3. Update DirectX: If an update is necessary, it should show up in Windows Update; however, if you'd like to update manually, you can check out [**these steps**](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/179113). If you have the latest version, you may want to [**disable the debug version of DirectX**](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201761974-Bug-Splat-and-Game-Crashes#wq10). \n4. [**Install Microsoft .NET Framework 3.5**](http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=22) (if you already have it installed, you can skip this step!)\n5. [**Perform a clean boot on Windows**](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201761974-Bug-Splat-and-Game-Crashes#wq7): 3rd party applications may interfere with League of Legends and cause issues.\n6. [**Reset your graphics card software**](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201761974-Bug-Splat-and-Game-Crashes#wq8). Some settings may cause issues with League of Legends, so resetting those settings may fix the issue. \n7. Lastly, you may want to re-install Microsoft Visual C++ Redistributable. If you're running x32 bit, [**use this download**](http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=5555). If you're running x64/86 bit, [**use this download**](http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=14632). \n\nIf, by the end of all of those steps, you're still encountering the black screen issue, we'll have to go through some more specific troubleshooting. Navigate to your League of Legends log folder:\n> C:\\Riot Games\\League of Legends\\logs\n\nand upload any r3dlogs associated to games that you weren't able to connect to. You can upload these logs to http://upload.wrenchmen.org/ and link the file here. \n\nI look forward to your response!","replies":[{"poster":"Sir Grumps A lot","date":"2015-11-27T01:21:47.622+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I went through all the things you have listed.
