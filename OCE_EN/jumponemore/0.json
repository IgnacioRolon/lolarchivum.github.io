It depends on if the person who's identity you stole knows. Usually if they're elderly they'll see RIOT games and assume it was something coming back on them from what they did in the 60's, burning panties etc. most young people are broke and check their card all the time, Riot prefer stolen cards from elderly people.\n\nEditt* as for stolen RP cards, you gotta steal them from the right region, OCE cards will only work in OCE - Hope I've helped!\n\n{{sticker:slayer-jinx-catface}}","replies":[]}]}]}
