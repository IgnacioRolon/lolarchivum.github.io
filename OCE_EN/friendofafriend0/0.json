But regardless of the macro it simply does not work. It works on everything BUT league. I've tried simulating holding down the key for about 10ms and even 1000ms. But no matter what I try it doesn't work. Here's an example of what I've tried.\r\n\r\nRButton::\r\nSend {^4 down}\r\nSleep 15\r\nSend {^4 up}\r\nSend {RButton down}\r\nSleep 15\r\nSend {RButton up}\r\n\r\nPS: Its my dream to laugh on movement.

This is for a logitech keyboard & the \"G-Keys\". it might work with Auto-it but I'm not sure.\n\nAlso, its probably worth noting from what I understand making a macro for anything other than a text commands that do more than 1 key press might get you banned. Although nothing you appear to be doing e.g making you laugh on movement would \"give you an unfiar advantage\" I'd still be careful as it might get picked up as a script.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Sackboy","date":"2014-11-26T23:04:45.011+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"If you do that, enjoy not being able to lasthit or orbwalk, oh and the fact your entire team will mute you.","replies":[]}]}
