I didn&#039;t think so. As much hate as Ivern gets shit for being fkin useless, in the jungle he is fkin oppressive as he can pretty much deny the red and blue buffs no sweat for the entire game because of the new jg timers the put in the game. Becuse of this I just lost a ranked game literally just before i started writing this even though all lanes were doing crappily I Know Ivern&#039;s  broken wave clear would have made an unfair broken advantage latter on. (FYI: they trashed us in just over 20 minutes) seriously it&#039;s fustrating and broken to walk to your buffs only to find them empty for the 5th time in a row. Riot plz either remove the jungle timers or nerf the fk out of Iverns passive such that it&#039;s about the same as an average jungler. {{sticker:zombie-brand-mindblown}} {{sticker:zombie-nunu-bummed}} {{sticker:zombie-nunu-tears}}","replies":[{"poster":"Lord Sesshomaru","date":"2016-10-12T23:44:05.644+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"He has a 30% win rate, he cant be all that oppressive....\n\nPretty sure Lee Sin is a far more oppressive jungler.","replies":[]},{"poster":"SmaugCity","date":"2016-10-12T16:21:16.151+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I think the bigger issue here is your pathing. If you aren't at your buffs as they are spawning you will get dumped on by players who have spent months drilling the most efficient clear paths. Even being there at the right time with low health or between buys often means conceding a buff. \n\nHowever with Ivern, you literally just have to be** _there_**. He has no damage and a skillshot escape/root: negating his impact is pitifully easy, which is why he's a bottom tier jungler in solo queue.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Knuuckles","date":"2016-10-12T00:17:28.212+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Predict his movements wait for him and kill him, he is useless in a 1v1 situation","replies":[]},{"poster":"Tempered in Salt","date":"2016-10-11T14:56:48.815+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"And yes i ward properly I'm a support jungle main... apologies for the bad grammar and negative speech I'm just taking out my frustrations...
