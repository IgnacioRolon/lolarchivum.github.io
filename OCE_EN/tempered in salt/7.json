Roles have dissolved and the only thing that seems viable is heavy ap champs that are broken beyond all belief. Fkin Ryze and kill some on in under 0.5 seconds now ffs and any losing match up against an ap champ is doomed to lose. Riot you believed that a champion and the mechanics of the game must be fun to play with and against... if you truly believe in that design philosophy you&#039;ll balance the dmg or provide away to circumvent being absolutely destroyed by damage with no way to counter move. \r\n\r\nDamn it so help me I&#039;ll uninstall and rally people around this discussion to uninstall is this is not fixed asap. \r\n\r\nAnd trust me as a thresh who&#039;s honed the art of being helpful to the team without balls ass damage I love this game... I know that some times when i land hooks it&#039;s devastating and can frustrate people but at least it feels like you were legitimately out played in such situations.{{sticker:zombie-nunu-bummed}}","replies":[{"poster":"QAPLA","date":"2017-11-07T22:37:46.942+0000","up_votes":8,"down_votes":0,"body":"Chill out, it will be balanced in time.\nPre-season is always about big changes and finding balance before competition starts again.\n\nKnee-jerk reactions are unwarranted, just give proper feedback (like you were beta testing), and watch it get sorted.","replies":[{"poster":"Tempered in Salt","date":"2017-11-08T08:16:42.781+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Good point... mb. little bit of an over reaction","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Essembie","date":"2017-11-23T10:19:39.348+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I do like the idea of combining runes and masteries - they were a big barrier for new players trying to get into the game.\n\nThere will be tweaks - it is a pretty big departure from the evolution of their 10 year old model.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Nato Boram","date":"2017-11-08T15:13:12.863+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"This must be your first preseason :)\n\nBasically a preseason is when they put a whole lot of changes in preparation for the new season. Because the season isn't started, ranked games are disabled.\n\nPreseason is the time to test game-changing changes, with reworks to whole aspects of the game. This time, it's runes and masteries. It's always a flop at first, but they figure things out and it becomes playable at the beginning of the season. Remember Thunderlords?\n\nIt's like playing on PBE, with less bugs, with servers near you, and more unbalance for a short period of time.\n\nRiot has enough playing data on the live servers to let their data scientist extract trends, make sense of wtf is happening and analyse the impact of the preseason on the games, the players and the champions.\n\nThe only way you can help them is by playing. That's it. This will generate more data for them to analyze.","replies":[]},{"poster":"xX uruz Xx","date":"2017-11-08T14:15:18.064+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"There's a reason they literally turn ranked off to make these big changes.
