Nearly what 5-6 seasons of OCE being up and running, where I've seen hardly any improvement. The will to troll outweighs that to win in this region. Fix it, we're paying you enough money to do so.

Hence the reason I don't give a fuck about producing \"evidence\" to prove shit. Riot already have the evidence. Stop trying to down play that there is a fucked up problem in OCE. Your ignorance is almost the same as Riots. Yes Riot is not a psychology clinic, I didn't claim it to be. Read what I fucken said \" Riot \"ARE\" in a position to persuade or encourage...\". Obviously you haven't been through much of the bullshit most of us have been through. So this post isn't for you. In other words, go back to General Chat or where ever the fuck it is you spend your time. While you're at it, do you understand that its better for business, for Riot to have toxic players buying shit from their stores, than it is to have toxic players banned and not buying. You really think you're the only one that knows how business operates zzz.","replies":[{"poster":"TheDemonEmperor","date":"2019-07-02T10:46:14.744+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"> Obviously you haven't been through much of the bullshit most of us have been through\nUsing inclusive langue, yet only speaking from within; You might be able to fool newbies with that sale pitch.

Then continue to bring up numerical reasoning. \n\nTo add on an ounce of logic, if Riot didn't ban toxic players, then the majority of their clientele would QUIT BY NOW. Or are you willing to argue the majority of the players now are a pernicious bunch; And only people like you are the few remaining good guys? \n\nCould it be. You have the details of players that should've been ban, but didn't due to their expenditure in the game? Go ahead and give proof. \n\nIt's getting rather tiresome for me to look at your imagination. \n\n> You really think you're the only one that knows how business operates zzz.\n\nOh? If you claim to understand how business work. Why can't you understand that it would be bad for business if undesirable situations persist; And it would be best for continuation's sake to solve the issue asap?\n\nIf the situation you've describe is REALITY, the game would been shut down due to ethical negligence ages ago.

Toxicity does the opposite.\n\nFor example, let's say you have a very toxic player. Even if we assume they are continuing to spend money despite warnings of losing the account (or in many cases have already lost an account), they are still only a single player. Meanwhile, they are turning the people they play with off the game.\n\nToxicity makes people quit games, particularly new players who have no existing attachment. So who is more valuable to Riot here? The single toxic player, or the multiple existing and/or potential players?","replies":[{"poster":"opL RP1TUP","date":"2019-07-26T16:19:47.932+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Still not seeing your point of view.
