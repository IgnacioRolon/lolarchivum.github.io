Now, I can hear the game happening and type in the chat (obviously can&#039;t see any replies, though) and my screen remains with &#039;Input Not Supported&#039;. This has never happened before until the recent update. I thought it was because I was using the Legacy Client but its the same result with Alpha, and I don&#039;t know how to fix it. If someone knows what the problem could be please let me know. \r\n\r\nThanks.","replies":[{"poster":"SephirothSG","date":"2017-01-14T09:05:39.401+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey there,\n\nThis is currently a [known issue](http://boards.euw.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/help-support-en/VJeqP4UK-fullscreen-issueout-of-range-issue) and a fix is in the works, however for now you can try some of the workarounds provided in the linked thread, let me know if anything helps.","replies":[]}]}
