Whatever you call it nowadays. I&#039;m here to establish what the actual rules for Hide and Seek are.\n\nIf you are unaware Hide and Seek is the most commonly played custom game-mode in League. And here are the rules.\n\n**BANNED CHAMPS**\n\nTeemo, Eve and Rengar are banned champs for both teams. They are banned for both teams to reduce the complexity of the whole &quot;but I can play Rengar hider&quot; debate. \n\nShaco is not permabanned under any circumstances. \n\n**HIDERS**\n\n- 5 hiders try and survive for 40 minutes on the dominion map against 2 seekers.\n\n- Each of the hiders get 5 lives, however if a hider has been AFK their lives are divided equally among all other hiders. \n(Usually this means a simple +1 life for all hiders)\n\n- Hiders may only use abilities that contain a form of CC, heal, movement, invulnerability etc. The key here is that if the ability only does damage it is generally banned.\n\n- Hiders cannot auto attack unless that auto attack does hard CC on that attack. No Braum babe you cannot stack passive &lt;/3\n\n- Hiders may not return to their base or sit within tower range as this leaves them invulnerable.  \n\n- Hiders cannot kill seekers unless they purposely chase below 300 health. CC bombing and chaining is considered BM.\n\n- Can&#039;t cap towers\n\n- No more than one passive slow item and one active slow item per team. If the slow is not used, for example Dead Mans, than the rule is bypassed in that particular case. This also applies to using Twin Shadows solely for the purpose of finding traps.  \n\n**SEEKERS**\n\n- You must recall when below 300 health or risk death. Hiders should try and give you time to recall however if you chase you are certainly going to die. \n\n- Can&#039;t cap towers\n\n- No more than one passive slow item and one active slow item per team. If the slow is not used, for example Dead Mans, than the rule is bypassed in that particular case. This also applies to using Twin Shadows solely for the purpose of finding traps.\n\n**ITEMS**\n\nBanned items are:\n\n- Thornmail, GA and Sunfire\n\n- Hiders cannot build any item that only offers pure damage\n\n**How the game is played**  \n\nThe above rules are for the Hide and Seek custom game-mode in League of Legends. Players play this game-mode on the Dominion map in a custom lobby with the **Draft Mode** pick type.  Tournament Draft can be used but offers no bonus to game-play and just promotes Pause trolling. \n\nHiders must run and hide from seekers who are trying to kill them. If a hider dies 5 times before the 40 minute mark they are out. If at least one hider has 1 life by the 40 minute mark the hider team wins. If the seekers kill each hider 5 times before 40 minutes then the seeker team wins.\n\nTo try and clean up the community it is advisable to keep a personal blacklist of players who purposely troll. Do not publish this list as it is against Riot&#039;s privacy policy. \n\nGL and HF summoner... oh wait... umm Champions?\n\nRIP Summoner lore. {{item:3151}}","replies":[{"poster":"Talon12","date":"2015-09-27T14:48:53.169+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"is ludens, things like ekko e,  allowed?  if an enemy is hit twice by ekko q can he aa for the slow/speed?\n\nthat's the problems I find in the game","replies":[{"poster":"ƒamous","date":"2015-09-28T03:13:12.147+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Or get enough CDR to throw it out to proc the third q stack and get the extra movement speed.
