These stacks apply DOT that scales with AP. If a target gains 5 stacks they are slowed by (?) for (?) seconds. Stacks decay after 2 seconds. \r\n\r\nQ- \r\nSprays ravenous insects in a small cone for 2 seconds. These insects deal DOT and slow for a small amount. {{summoner:14}} {{summoner:3}} \r\n\r\nW- \r\nSae Daes injects its target with a deadly poison that deals (?) initial damage and detonates all stacks on enemy dealing increased damage with each stack. {{summoner:11}} \r\n\r\nE- \r\nSae Daes dashes towards target location dealing damage in an AOE where it lands. {{summoner:4}} \r\n\r\nR- \r\nSea Daes triggers all stacks of his passive within an area. All Champions with stacks of the passive are silenced and dealt damage based on the amount of stacks they have. {{item:3751}} \r\n\r\n**Lane Viability:**\r\nMID Lane DOT based mage/Assassin.  (Melee Auto Attacks)\r\nMight be able to jungle but would most likely have to build beefier.\r\nTOP lane Sae Daes would be too squishy against most bruisers with glass cannon build. \r\nSupport may be viable as a poke/harass combo bot lane. \r\n\r\nIn effect Sai Daes would have to build beefier to compensate for its DOT damage dealing nature. \r\n\r\n**Laning:**\r\nSae Daes would poke and harass enemy champion while looking for an opportune moment to get a W off for&hellip; massive damage. Countered by sustain enemies as well as those who can dive or poke Sae Daes relatively safely (Leblanc, Yasuo, Lux). \r\n\r\n**Teamfights:**\r\nSae Daes would open with Q to add stacks to as many enemies as possible. Sae Daes would then trigger R stunning enemy champions leaving the squishy enemy assassin/mage/adc open for a W. \r\n\r\n**Play Style: **\r\nLane bully the opponent into submission. If they fight back make them pay for it with your epic DOT and disengage with E.\r\n\r\n**Counters:**\r\nSae Daes while being a great harassing champ an all in damage dealer has no real way to exit a fight. If the enemy has the opportunity to fight back then Sae Daes&rsquo; squishy nature will lead to it melting like a hot knife through butter. CC is best to break a Sae Daes combo or to retreat before too many passive stacks are added. \r\n\r\nSae Daes does not have a sex. It is an it.\r\n\r\n_**LORE IS WIP**_","replies":[{"poster":"Alamo","date":"2015-06-17T08:46:38.202+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"diz ieda iz propstoroz","replies":[]},{"poster":"kJs","date":"2015-06-17T00:10:02.884+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You said \"his passive\". \nAll I'm imagining is D'vorah from MKX running around the rift.","replies":[]}]}
