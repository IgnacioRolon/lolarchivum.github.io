This is done by pressing a small button near the allies’ portrait. \r\n\r\nQ- Kharis fires a clone in a direction, if that clone comes into contact with an enemy or reaches the maximum range it will explode dealing damage and applying distraught to the enemy. Auto attacks trigger stacks of distraught causing the enemy to become confused (old fear).\r\n\r\nW- Kharis splits in two randomly becoming either the left or right clone, the clone will mimic Kharis moving in the exact opposite direction of Kharis. Within 4 seconds Kharis may choose to switch to the clones position.\r\n\r\nE- Kharis blinks in and out of visibility for a short time, during the effect Kharis gains movement speed at the cost of survivability. \r\n\r\nR- Kharis sends out multiple clones into the field, these move randomly in a set area and slow anyone they move through, when the effect ends the remaining clones stop for 1 second then explode dealing moderate damage. \r\n\r\nLore- \r\n“We have, all of us, gathered here to celebrate the life of Kharis.”\r\nA cloaked figure at the rear of the procession smiled. \r\n“Not much was known about Kharis, he came to us bedraggled, weak, starving and almost dead. His home and his loved ones taken by the Noxian horde as it swept across the country-side. He kept to himself mostly but he was still a member of our community. It is not known why the Noxians took his family or why they took the trouble to track him down and finish the job. Kharis will be missed, may he find peace in death.”\r\n\r\nEveryone began to disperse, saying their farewells to a man they hardly knew. The cloaked figure approached the coffin last. The figure stared at the face of the man they called Kharis, the face the figure new so well. But it was fine, Kharis was dead and the figure had a new face now.","replies":[{"poster":"Slim Chaedi","date":"2015-01-04T11:32:57.971+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Dear God, it is like fighting a million Shacos at once.","replies":[]},{"poster":"TrashDonnut","date":"2015-01-04T09:33:11.546+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"His W is too much like Zed's but overall it's really unique and good.","replies":[]}]}
