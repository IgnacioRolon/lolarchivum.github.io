Climbing as a support out of low elo is generally a more tedious progression.\n\nNo matter how good of a support you are with mechanics, macro, vision, map awareness - you're solely relying on the other 4 to carry (even if you win your lane with your adc). That's solo queue and blind faith mixed with the coin toss of teams.\n\nLow elo players generally lack game sense, macro, rotations and focus purely on micro mechanics and kills rather than objectives and CS. You also slow yourself down by duoing with someone as matchmaking becames more scuffed if you're asking to duo with someone in high gold and plat.\n\nPlay a carry lane/role that has a potential to impact greatly compared to support in low elo because you're asking to be carried.","replies":[]}]}
