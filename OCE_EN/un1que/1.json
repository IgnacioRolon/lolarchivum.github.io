I quit my job to do this full time and along side getting coached by a Master I am studying the game inside and out and looking at ways to get better. My hopes are to in 2018 be able to join a team. I play Monday - Friday 9:00am - 6:00pm AEST (about 9 hours a day) and am looking for someone to Duo with ( or multiple people) in those times.\r\n\r\nI am looking to Duo with an ADC but any position is fine. Some requirements are below:\r\n- Must have Discord or Team Speak\r\n- Must have an understanding of the game\r\n- Must have a desire to get better\r\n- Cannot be arrogant or have the bronze mentality\r\n\r\n* Full Disclaimer\r\n\r\nI love the game and enjoy it. I have fun, BUT, I am not here to muck around and have laughs. If you want laughs and a good time we can play ARAM together. I am here to get better, win and advance. I treat this more like a job than a hobby. I love being able to do this all day and it makes me happy, win or loss, because I am learning and getting better and slowly progressing to my ultimate goal. HOWEVER, I am not here to throw games or go backwards so I only ask that people who want to DUO with me have the same mentality.\r\n\r\nA bit about me:\r\n\r\nAlong side playing League of Legends I am also studying Psychology. I have a cool and calm nature about me. I can be a bit bossy but that&#039;s because I love winning and I want to get better and advance through the ranks. My favorite champion is Lulu and my champion pool atm is:\r\n{{champion:117}}  Lulu\r\n{{champion:89}} Leona\r\n{{champion:37}} Sona\r\n{{champion:267}} Nami\r\n{{champion:40}} Janna\r\n{{champion:44}} Taric\r\n\r\nI have been climbing solo but I find it a lot easier with a Duo partner but I need someone that wants to climb and knows their champions inside and out like myself and wants to get better and learn. If you tick the boxes and are sick of getting bad ques then add me in game and we will play some normal matches and see what your ability is like and whether we click in Discord/Team Speak.\r\n\r\nThank you for your time and good luck on the Rift! :)","replies":[{"poster":"Un1que","date":"2017-11-15T02:03:14.146+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I did indeed my friend.

Outside of playing League I study lane mechanics, warding proper, how to engage, disengage, item choices, etc. I didn't know everyone else on the server was doing this exact thing? \n\nThank you for the concern but I will be fine :)","replies":[]},{"poster":"SOOM","date":"2017-11-15T19:40:38.371+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"XD whitepumah what a lad","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"TG Joshua","date":"2017-11-15T09:29:01.155+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Add me in-game.
