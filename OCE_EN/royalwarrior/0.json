I&#039;ve been raged at a lot for not paying attention to pings and have raged at people for not following pings. Getting roamed on is not fun for anyone on the team. Firstly, the person who gets ganked loses his lead and the person who dies as a result of that gank now has to play it safe. I have left the game many times solely because of this reason. \r\n\r\nI know there are some shy players who don&#039;t like to verbally communicate and I understand that, they can disable voice chat whenever they feel but there are some who prefer verbal communication like myself and for players like us, it makes the game a lot less enjoyable when I ping an objective at the right time and nobody on the team arrives on time. With team commnication, it fixes the problem significantly because players would be more alert of when to react.\r\n\r\nI know there are concerns with toxicity in voice chat but that can easily be avoided if players would listen to each other, or if that doesn&#039;t work then I would be open to a mute option. You simply can&#039;t call make this a &quot;team&quot; game by not including voice communication. You can even bring back dynamic queue and let people queue up with friends as long as everyone is connected to voice.","replies":[{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2019-02-13T02:02:51.490+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"Personally I've experienced *far* more abuse from voice chat in games like OW than I ever have in text chat in games like League.

Bad eggs will be bad eggs. Most of my rage in this game is directly linked to people who have tunnel vision in their lane and despite multiple, timely and well placed pings, they do not react, then get embarrassed and mad and just lash out/int all game because they're demoralized and feel shit for not realising they could've won their lane if they saw those pings/messages.\n\nThis game's community is horrendous, and that's because a substantial amount of them haven't even developed a sense of moral conscience yet. \nMany of which also haven't really learned the written word to any tangible level, so don't respect it.\nIf you implement a voice based system, something all of us understand because we start listening and audibly proclaiming our desires and intentions at birth, communication becomes more meaningful and impactful to both the game and them as developing people.","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"DestroyerDa007","date":"2019-02-14T16:33:26.704+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Voice chat in league of legends will absolutely intensify the already toxic community.

Riot should focus on reforming players first and then think about elements like team or cross team voice chat.\n\nActually, toxicity based on what is typed is punished constantly, overbearingly so if anything. It's actual game impact trolls that grief and intentionally feed that are never punished, it's well documented. There are  accounts of challengers that int 50% of their games to stay in low elo so they can play their fun 100% win carry combos in low elo, which are never, ever, banned, or punished, or otherwise.\n\nMute would exist like it does for text, the system does not change, except that things are faster.\n\nIf anything it's the punishment system itself that has a negative impact on the attitude of players. eg. I myself was banned perm for raging out in chat at inters and trolls. Legit inters and trolls, not just people playing badly for one game.\nBeing punished for that has nothing but soured my view of Riot as a games developers and community manager. They have zero respect for their own community and take zero pride in any aspect other than their esports level players. I have since chilled a little, and.... rage less, though it still happens as I generally just don't take things head-down-arse-up, but just less, I have no care for my account as my original account, which was banned, I had spent at least $3000 on, if not closer to 4000. So I essentially consider myself robbed by Riot themselves.\nSpout all the \"thems the rules chump\" crap you want, but the fact is, that's how people feel. You can't just change human nature, you have to work around it.","replies":[]}]}]}
