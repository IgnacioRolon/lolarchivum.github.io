Skins have nothing to do with clash so that doesn’t mean shit and if you stayed home to play league than that’s your own damn fault not riots. Hell if u want an example it’s like going to a concert, they are having tech issues and after an hour they send every one home telling them they will get their money back. \nRiot has said they will give everyone back their clash tickets so stop your damn complaining","replies":[{"poster":"TwinBladez","date":"2018-05-26T01:19:39.159+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"While skins have nothing to do with it.

Following on from that if you took time off to go a concert and due to tech issues they concert couldn’t go ahead as a planned. Are your going to sue them for the hours you took off work so you could go? You barely have a case.\n\nRiot has already said that every one will get their tickets back. You people really need to learn that some time things in life just don’t work out the way you want all the time and some time shit happen. And instead of trying to find some one or something to blame, in this case riot. Just accept it. Shit happens get over it.

One important part of the ACL to consider here is this particular passage:\n\n> If a good or service fails to meet a guarantee, a\nconsumer has rights against the supplier, and in\nsome cases the manufacturer, who will have to\nprovide a ‘remedy’ in order to put right a fault,\ndeficiency or failure to meet an obligation.\nIf a supplier fails to meet a guarantee, the\nremedy may be:\n• a repair, replacement or refund\n• cancellation of a service\n• compensation for damages and loss.\n\n> Source: http://consumerlaw.gov.au/business-and-the-acl/ \"Consumer Guarantees\" [PDF](https://cdn.tspace.gov.au/uploads/sites/60/2016/05/0553FT_ACL-guides_Guarantees_web.pdf)\n\nThe \"guarantee\", in this case, being that Clash be functioning upon it's release. Thus far, they *have* provided a ticket refund to players (\"consumers\") affected by the crash, which will, at the very least, afford them a *reasonable* amount of time to resolve the technical issues that have occurred, thus meaning they have acted in accordance with the ACL.\n\nAs it stands, there is yet no case to be made against Riot for the troubles that have occurred relating to Clash, and while you might argue that some people have \"lost\" income as a result of missing work for Clash, that is *their own decision*, not something required of Riot to participate in Clash, and as such has no bearing on the issues that have occurred (long story short, their own stupid decisions caused that particular problem).\n\nIn fact, as far as the ACL goes, it *does* state to take any disputes to the \"supplier\" (being Riot, in this case) *first*, before taking it up with the ACCC and/or taking legal action. So, when it comes down to it, if you *have not yet* received the ticket refund (which is all you'll get based on the ACL at this point), you need to take that to [Support](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/requests/new), who *should* help resolve the issue. Beyond that, there's nothing else that the ACL requires, or that the ACCC can do as of yet.\n\nNow, if it were to come to a point where Clash had been inoperable for several months, even several weeks, that would reasonably indicate players are due some form of compensation, but unless that actually happens, it seems your point is nothing more than simple complaints on an unforeseeable fault that Riot are currently trying to resolve, and not more than three hours after the issue occurred no less.\n\nIf, at the end of the day, all that hasn't convinced you, then go ahead, sue Riot. I would very much like to see you fail and go in debt to the army of lawyers that Riot will employ to prove their point (not that they'd need more than one, mind you).","replies":[{"poster":"orphic","date":"2018-05-26T06:33:20.742+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Nailed him.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"DarkSoul1994","date":"2018-05-25T14:05:43.010+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"What is false or misleading about it?

Legally, they are just letting you borrow their stuff. _(essentially, RP purchases are them buying their own stuff, using your money, then allowing you to borrow it)_ So that kind of makes them their own consumers, and they're hardly going to sue themselves for not letting you borrow their shit on time.\n\n\nSo suing them for not allowing you to borrow their shit, is hardly going to stand up in court.\n_\"Waahhhhh, wahhhh, the guy next door lets me borrow his lawnmower on Saturdays, but he wasn't home this Saturday so I couldn't borrow it, so he should have to pay me!\"_ will get laughed out of any court anywhere, infact the taxi driver would probably laugh you out of the car before you even got to court.\n\nYea, the terms and conditions kinda make them look like dicks _(and its gunna suck when they go out of business and we realise we all pumped hundreds of dollars down the drain)_, but if they didn't cover their asses like that, there wouldn't be a game to play at all.
