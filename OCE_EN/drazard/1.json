Very team focused and have a good knowledge base of matchups and win conditions.\r\n\r\ni have a total of 30 or so ranked games in my career, and i am placed low. over the coming weeks i will be trying to do more ranked to find out where in this silly system the game thinks my skills are at. (i dont really beleive in the ranking system and dont often do any ranked at all, what a person can bring to a 5&#039;s team cannot be measured by their solo Q rank alone)\r\n\r\nI&#039;m willing to join a team and learn to play with others, i am not a professional but i spend 10+ hours every day playing something or rather, i use to be a top australian player for an old shooter, so when i put my focus and attention into a game i truley beleive i can be the best with time, and i am looking for a team that will accept my flaws and that i can grow with. I am looking for a game to become a serious competitor in Be it league of legends, or the new overwatch.\r\nIn conclusion i am looking for a team, or a small group of members that are serious about forming a team to one day put OCE into worlds, and as high as that goal may seem with practice and precise teamwork im sure i can acheive this so why not give me a shot?\r\n\r\nMy IGN is Drazard and i look forward to your in-game responses.","replies":[]}
