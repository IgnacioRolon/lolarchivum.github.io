Not sure if it&#039;s a smart idea, but it will let me see where I can improve or what I did wrong.\r\nI don&#039;t main a specific role, but I have choices for each lane.\r\nI suppose it&#039;s something to do.

I've played about 50-60 games and now I'm B1! I should have done something like this because I think I definitely improved. In bronze remember to cs as well as you possibly can while roaming to get others fed. There are too many people in Bronze that either cs poorly or only care about kills... (I have to admit my cs needs a lot of work too haha). Also, try not to die as much because you are making the game harder for yourself as the other gets more fed and you dont get to cs for 1-2 minutes as you are dead/walking to lane - (a 3/0 Vayne with 200cs at 20min is better than a 5/5 Vayne with 150cs at 20min) Good Luck!","replies":[{"poster":"JasonWazza","date":"2015-04-03T06:14:27.180+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":">(a 3/0 Vayne with 200cs at 20min is better than a 5/5 Vayne with 150cs at 20min)\n\nAlso to do with this sort of stuff, don't steal kills if your feeding, reseting your kill gold only helps the enemy team, i'd rather someone go 10 deaths if they have 0/10/20 over 10/10/10 because they are giving more gold up by taking the kills, and probably not being any more helpful with the kills.","replies":[]},{"poster":"CSE Predator3","date":"2015-04-04T01:25:17.133+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I actually realise that makes sense in regards to the above.

This narrows down from having all those champions you see other players play well at but have no idea how to play them yourself.\nRemember to always plays Comfort picks instead of counter picks when trying to get out of Bronze & Silver. Playing a champion you're comfortable on will always be more liking to win your lane than one you're not but is a counter pick.","replies":[{"poster":"Predator3","date":"2015-04-03T00:29:44.492+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Definitely Some good advice.
