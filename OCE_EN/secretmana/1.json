( ill admit not all of them are because of the bug, but most are ) this is getting really annoying.\r\nIf yous could possibly look into this, thatd be awesome. or if anyone else is getting this problem have a geeze, post a fix, or any info.\r\nCheers.","replies":[{"poster":"SKT T1 Taehoon","date":"2015-01-12T04:46:27.042+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"no this has happened to me so you  click accept right. say you inv others from friends list okay afte you click accept it takes you back to the inv page and then it stays there you click start game and it says you and so and so are un able to join queue as you are already in a game but your not this is one of the oldest bugs dw its not just happening to you and its really pissing me off now leavebusters 20 mins up to the last one and it does this so i have to restart my lpq #riotsortyourgameoutplz","replies":[]},{"poster":"HORSE OF FORCE","date":"2015-01-05T23:30:01.049+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Seems weird.

It did nothing for about 8 seconds but it didnt kick us out. We got into the game and the timer was 8 seconds behind which meant my initial pick is the one i had to play because at 8 seconds left on the timer it went into prematch countdown","replies":[]}]}
