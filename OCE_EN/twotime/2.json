I have tried running as admin and stuff like that, I have tried deleting the RADS folders all that good stuff, I don&#039;t have AVAST and I&#039;ve re installed but I can&#039;t do the download part because it won&#039;t open up the league when I click the launcher.\r\nIf anyone knows what&#039;s going on I&#039;d appreciate it because I&#039;m sick of being told to read the other threads and told the same stuff over again.
