Just played a game that was over after the 5 minute mark due to me being bad at league.  I had to sit around and get killed over and over again while the enemy team trashed talked the whole game. It was not a very fun experience and has made me never want to play League of legends again.\r\n\r\nYours Truly- Rompi","replies":[{"poster":"The Big Yikes","date":"2018-10-27T13:06:48.016+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"***","replies":[{"poster":"MagmaPants","date":"2018-10-27T13:09:40.138+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":1,"body":"Dear Riot The Big Yikes,\n\nIt's sad too see that you think games aren't over by the 5 minute mark but you fail to understand that when there is an {{champion:84}} in the game it is over by Champ Select. I hope this message is sent over to the balance team to fix this bug.\n\nSincerely,\nRompi","replies":[{"poster":"The Big Yikes","date":"2018-10-27T13:11:08.996+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"Nerf {{champion:27}}","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Pured","date":"2018-11-04T00:01:30.159+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"1- You can type \"/mute all\" in chat.\n2- Anyone who surrenders should have never queued up in the first place if they don't want to play.
