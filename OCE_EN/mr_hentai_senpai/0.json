I couldn't reconnect to a match 5 times. I'm not sure if the enemy team had anybody tech savvy enough to cause disconnects, it's a local problem, I pissed somebody off saying \"talk that sheit up\" after Mundo said he'd be unstoppable then we were like 3kills ahead to their 0 1min:40s into laning I think,  somebody's stalking me and wants to make me miserable in game for believing isis are basically child humpers who try trick the young into dying for them as fighters and using religion as a scapegoat to do terrible things (so many sensitive people thinking allieh is copying Allah and bugging me..I just wanted all + alien because xenomorphs are cooooool) or an ally of mine got annoyed thinking I was telling them how to upgrade abilities for most damage (eg getting Q once on Syndra then max everything else first since it's not that long in range and good for spamming balls to set up more damage in her ults in a less costly manner). Wow i disconnected 3 times while logged off LoL, I hope I'm not being attacked or my friend's being a douche since he and his dad are tech savvy -.- (if this was Southpark I’d be Kyle and he’d be Cartman.. not physically, mainly behavioral and in things he finds funny -.-) I'm not a techy, I just love LoL and I'm paranoid. {{summoner:2}} Oh and maybe a disgruntled game developer working under Riot is secretly attacking me for how I play and use solari{{item:3190}} a lot to cater noobs, noticed it's been nerfed like 3 times in 5 months? from the passive of +20 mr with aoe regen , then 15mr aoe regen, now 10 mr and no aoe regen :/ These were the people in the match and a bug report..I had another bug report while idly logged into LoL but I couldn't report it -.- http://tinypic.com/view.php?pic=15wyl55&s=9 http://tinypic.com/view.php?pic=vdg3ro&s=9 I was 2-1-8 but yeah..I couldn't reconnect for like 17min and they lost 4vs5 even though we were ranged pokers","replies":[]},{"poster":"Mr Hentai Senpai","date":"2015-11-17T10:58:38.339+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I have Telstra ISP with Telstra cable.\nIt's happening second time right now.\nWhile I typed this up.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Mr Hentai Senpai","date":"2015-11-17T10:25:35.655+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Now after waiting for 7 minutes.
