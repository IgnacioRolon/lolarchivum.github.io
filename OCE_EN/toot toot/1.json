As this is written, we currently have two active squads dedicated to Oceania and plan to grow much larger, so join today and assist in something that will be big.\r\n\r\nTactical Gaming is all about  team work, dedication and comradery. No matter what league you sit in, what level you are or your skill level, there&#039;s a place for you with us! With more players joining, we can easily accommodate for players who wish to be placed into a ranked team and those that simply wish for a casual team. \r\n\r\nI have been with Tactical Gaming and experienced the wonderful environment that comes with it. I have not regretted a second, because without TG I wouldn&#039;t have the friendships that I have now and the experiences that I have got from such an amazing place to be. \r\n\r\nDuring my time, I have learnt a lot about the game through the practices hosted. Thanks to Tactical Gaming, I can say without a doubt that my teamwork abilities have improved by far as well as my skills in various champions and lanes. With this, I was able to climb out of Bronze V and into Silver V just in time for the end of season four!\r\n\r\nTactical Gaming is like a giant family, and encourages everyone to give every challenge your best shot, a motto that can be used both in matches and in our real lives. With Tactical Gaming, we understand that real life events can happen and believe that it takes priority over the clan.\r\n\r\nTactical Gaming hosts many games over a variety of genres, from it&#039;s origins sitting in battlefield. It&#039;s run with a sense of military-esque style with a ranking system and a ladder that, if you wish, can climb to success. Wish to climb to sergeant? You can! A journalist? We have a news team!

(\"Members will show dignity, honor and integrity both in and outside of TG\")\n\nb) Sure it says it supports casual players but being known not as an individual but as a representative of TG (meaning you represent TG's values, not your own) even when you just want good community play it kind of rubs you out as a person when playing a game that you enjoy.\n\nc) (\"If a member leaves TG on **good terms**, the decision will be respected and **not questioned**. He will be granted a **honourable discharge** and will be welcomed back if he chooses to return at a later date.\") This isn't the military or the professional gaming counterpart, TG presents itself as an isolated gaming community aimed at providing positive play for members. However constant reminders of strict regulation meaning you need to \"walk by the wall or leave\", a saying you hear in many dictatorships... The **not questioned **bit really gets to me.\n\nDon't believe for a second that I doubt the structure of your community and that it is very positive, but sometimes I just like being myself and comfortable with that in my gaming community","replies":[{"poster":"Toot Toot","date":"2015-06-09T08:31:10.090+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"1. It doesn't restrict freedom of speech any more than school does, or any other organisation. When you are apart of a group, school, soccer team, etc, you in turn represent the team. It's fair for them to ask not to be a rude, inconsiderate asshat in the game and it comes down to wanting mature players.\n\n2. That's entirely false, just because you represent someone's values, doesn't mean you don't represent your own. Being a part of a community usually means that you encompass both their values and your own, because you'd only join a community that shares values similar to yours or else you wouldn't feel that close to said community.\n\n3. I mentioned in the original post that it tries to replicate a military-esque style, a major reason is due to the leaders being ex-military personnel themselves. You'll find that, any other large based community has regulations that you are intended to follow and I believe that you have misread the whole 'not questioned' part. It's not referring to you having to not question the rules, it's context is if you wish to leave Tactical Gaming due to real life reasons. We wont question your motives, we will happily accept it and welcome you back with open arms if you wish to return at a later date.\n\nTactical Gaming doesn't remove your personal touch, I tell you this whole heartedly considering the type of person I am. Like every large community, it has it's regulations and it wishes to keep the community both mature and true to its roots, all I can say is at least give the community a go.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}
