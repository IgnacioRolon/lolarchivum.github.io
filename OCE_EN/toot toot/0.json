We accept all from unranked to diamond, we have squads for all types of players! Want a relaxed and fun playing experience? We have the squad for you! Want a serious and competitive playing experience? We have the squad for you! Even for those inbetween, we have the squad! \n\nAfter registering to the site you have to go through a boot camp, though it may seem tedious, it is 100% worth it once you are done! It's a one and only time thing, and is mainly used for the higher ups to have something to look at! If you need help, need not worry, I am always here for you. Simply add me on League and I shall help you the best way I can! \n\nSo why not give us a try? Join TG today!\n\nBecause we all came from the NA region originally, we were all 1st Battalion but then OCE came around and squads split up, etc. \n\nThat's the main reason why we're 1st Batt and not 2nd, so it's all good! \n\nPrac Times are as follows for OCE: \n\nWednesday and Sunday 7pm - 9pm AEST (Daylight Savings the same time.)\n\nWhen registering don't forget two things!\nPlease put \"TG Sky\" in the reference bit! (It helps me more than you admittedly, but please.)\nPut 1st Battalion, not 2nd! (League of Legends division is run differently to the rest.)\n\nI look forward to seeing your name pop up in the TG community!\n\nHeadquarters: http://www.tacticalgaming.net/hq/\nHistory: http://www.tacticalgaming.net/history\nAbout us: http://www.tacticalgaming.net/hq/new...actical-gaming\nRegulations: http://www.tacticalgaming.net/hq/news/regulations\nQuick Registration: http://www.tacticalgaming.net/hq/index.php?app=referrals&reff=6914\n\n(When you register please reply here saying so, for both organisation reasons and bumping reasons!)\n\nThanks for reading!\n\nP.S.
