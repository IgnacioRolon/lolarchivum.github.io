Thresh - The God support for soloq, brings everything you could ever need.  He's tanky, has a ton of utility, scales super well and has a really strong early game/lane phase.  The only problem is he's hard to master and all of his kit is skillshots, if you don't play him already you should learn him, but give yourself time.\n--  Common build: Glory > Aegis OR Glory > Crucible\n\n\n2. Alistar - Gets free tank stats from his ult so you can get away with building movespeed (glory/talisman) and still be a huge front line tank.  He's super easy to play, sets up ganks really well with W>Q combo or Flash + Q + W them into your tower.  Just gotta learn your combo's and you'll be set.  Common build:\n-- Common build: Glory > Crucible OR Talisman > Glory\n\n\n3. Janna - By far the best peel support in the meta atm.  Huge impact with her ult and helps adc's survive lanephase with shields and peel.  I personally don't play her in soloq unless I'm supporting Raydere because she's 100% reactive and without a good adc you kind of feel useless.\n-- Common build: Crucible > Talisman OR Crucible > Aegis/Banner OR Mejais > Crucible if you're geedy (^:\n\n\n4. Annie - Really strong lanephase with stuns + ranged harass.  Sets up HUGE engages with her flash tibbers and allows you to have a lot of control of midgame/lategame teamfights.  Make sure to get the distortian enchant on your mobis because you're flash reliant (applies to other champions too, aka Ali).\n-- Common build: Talisman > Glory OR Talisman > AP (for soloq carry potential)\n\n\n5. Morgana - Morg is in this weird place for me where I actually hate playing her and I think she's garbage, but you feel like you need to pick it to keep your adc away from things, for example if you have an immobile Jinx into Moakai/Vi, black shield would be the only thing to be able to keep her alive.  She has a decent lane with Q + R lockdown, safe against ganks with E.\n-- Common build: Her build is very open actually, you can rush crucible and other defensive items to peel , or go Glory/Talisman > Zhonyas if you feel like your team needs engage.\n\nGeneral tips:\n-- Don't be a bitch.  You're not going to carry any games playing Janna and doing nothing.  Pick engage, be proactive and force your opponents to play around you.\n-- Mobi's + Sightstone is your first item on EVERY CHAMPION.  Don't be that guy that upgrades targons first back, that's a huge waste of 500 gold.\n-- If you get Mobi's + 1-3 greens on your first back, ping your jungler to come with you into their jungle and ward it up (if it's safe to do so, be weary of which lanes are getting shoved in/if their top has TP).  Knowing which side of the map the enemy jungler on with these wards basically negates all gank potential.\n-- ADC's hate it, but I do it all the time.  If your ADC is useless and you're going to lose bot lane even if you're there, roam.  You could be ganking mid/top and snowballing other sides of the map instead of sitting in an already losing lane.\n-- TIME FLASHES.  If you're playing champs with CC that set up ganks well, time the enemy flashes (5 minute cooldown) and set up ganks with your jungler","replies":[{"poster":"Chief EGym","date":"2015-07-30T04:08:01.680+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Idk why they're all labelled 1 when i labelled them 1-5 but oh well!","replies":[{"poster":"HI I AM LIAM","date":"2015-07-30T15:13:17.073+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"this helped me out a bunch man cheers \n(Y)","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Billos","date":"2015-07-29T08:42:05.110+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"From the main post it seems you guys win a crapload.\n\nDoes this ever get boring?

Winning doesn't get boring, to me. We're all competitors, and we're all in this to win. Winning is the product of hard work and ability. As the scene continues to grow, and other teams can challenge us more, it will become even more exciting and competitive -- but we'll always want to win.\n\nI personally find it is much easier to learn from teams that are better than you and through losing. Your mistakes are more heavily punished, and it becomes a lot more obvious where one's shortcomings lie. If you're winning, a lot of these mistakes or issues aren't as obvious, so they may not get addressed. Adding to this, if you're constantly winning with bad play/habits, these are getting reinforced; you're essentially being rewarded for what you're doing wrong.\n\nDepending on the context specifically of the player/team, but it's generally a mixture of both. Some players/teams are very mechanically gifted and can win a lot from outplaying their opponents, but will fall short because their game knowledge isn't rounded of deep. And this can be applied vice versa. It's important to be open and receptive to this sort of criticism, and admit in which areas a player/team needs to improve on, in order to ultimately improve their performance.  I think if I had to choose one, I'd say meeting a baseline criteria of mechanical skill is more important, because if your knowledge is extremely good but you're unable to pull it off, it's wasted.","replies":[{"poster":"Billos","date":"2015-07-29T14:42:46.409+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thanks for your answer :) I wasn't expecting something so in depth.

Also, due to the re-emergence of Viktor after bug fixes, is Cassiopeia still a top tier pick in the mid lane? If so, what are her benefits over the other frequently played mid lane champions such as Azir, Viktor, TF and what differentiates her to be such a strong pick?","replies":[{"poster":"Swiffer","date":"2015-07-29T07:46:11.679+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"At the moment and in her current iteration, Katarina is really subpar. Just mainly because her laning phase doesn't exist and then on top of that, she is required to snowball in order to actually be effective. Unless, you're incredibly comfortable or you're SKT I don't think Kat will see competitive play until she gets buffed.\nI think that one of the only reasons Cassiopeia reemerged with such prominence was because Viktor was disabled for such a long time. I also wrote this just below but, I think that almost every mid laner (rip kat) is viable at the moment and it depends on your expertise with the champion and what works for your team. \nI guess what would separate her is her insane consistent damage and lane dominance. Which was why for a few months you saw, in every competitive region, only Azir/Cassio being played. She's very similar to Azir in that respect but the reason Azir is considered better is because he has an escape mechanism. Since she took nerfs to her laning power she's taken a backseat to him. The only reason I can see you picking her now would just be her early lane control.","replies":[{"poster":"Chief Sangy","date":"2015-07-29T07:47:21.172+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Is subpar one word???","replies":[{"poster":"Strat","date":"2015-07-29T08:43:32.267+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yep, it is.

At the moment, not many teams are scrimming (understandably) since the majority of teams are taking breaks now that their seasons are finished, with the exception of the teams facing promotion/relegation. We're heading into bootcamp shortly, where we can grind out some final practice before hitting the stage. \n\nAs a team, we're not too concerned with that much. There's a lot of talk about previous results like Winter or Finals from 2014, but both teams are incredibly different since then, and there's a lot of external factors that are often overlooked. Providing we can come into the series relaxed and prepared, we'll be fine.\n\nFunnily enough, our Dragon control throughout OPL wasn't heavily stressed or planned, we just took advantage of opponents with poor timing/objective control. If teams were giving them up for free, of course we'd take them.
