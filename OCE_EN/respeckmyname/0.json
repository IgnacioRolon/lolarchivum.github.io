As in, if I try to buy something in the store I can&#039;t click on it properly or if I try to move my champ around the map it doesn&#039;t actually go to where I clicked? If I want to buy something from the store I have to click somewhere random on the map for it to hover over the item so  I can buy. Same goes with moving my champ to where I want them to be. Only fix to this is I have to reconnect to the game which sometimes leads into remakes and loss of lp. This has been happening since the last few patches since maybe 3 weeks ago? Has anyone else experienced this?","replies":[{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2018-02-07T10:23:37.075+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"In future technical issues like these are better suited to the Help and Support board.\n\nAs for your issue, it's a new one on me but it *sounds* like it's probably something to do with resolution (i..e the visuals are displaying at a different resolution than the actuality). Not totally sure what would cause that but I'll do my best to find you a fix.\n___\n\nFirst thing I would try would be to update your graphics card drivers, support article if you don't know how to do that: https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201761974-Bug-Splat-and-Game-Crashes#wq2\n\nIf that doesn't help I'd try running a client repair: Log in > Gear icon up top right for Settings > General (if not already there) > \"Initiate Full Repair\".\n\nIf those don't work I'd recommend resetting any graphics card software that might be interfering with League: https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201761974-Bug-Splat-and-Game-Crashes#wq8\n\nOne last thing that probably won't help but might is to make sure your in game resolution is set correctly: In game > Esc > Video\n___\n\nIf all that fails, you're probably best off submitting a ticket to player support. Probably include the details of your graphics card and card software as that might  help speed things up a bit: https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/requests/new","replies":[]}]}
