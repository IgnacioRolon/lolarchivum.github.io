It would help those people expanding on champ pools greatly. Sure you can list them down but wouldn&#039;t it be easier to know on the spot instead of shifting vision now and then? save those seconds maybe? what do you guys think?\r\n\r\nPS: Can&#039;t wait for the {{champion:83}}  update!

Ergo league is more of an investive (not a word but it should be) experience to try new things and have a general understand of multiple champions and roles so you don't get surprised when you don't know their abilities ect ( you can't actually outplay anyone if you don't know what they can throw at you and the availability of that damage/cc. This also applies to profitable itemization).","replies":[]}]}
