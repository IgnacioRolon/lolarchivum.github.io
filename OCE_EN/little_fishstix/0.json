Supp/Mid","subforum":"Clubs","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hi guys,\r\n\r\nI&#039;m looking for a friendly club or a small group of people to learn more in LoL. I am very open to feedback and constructive criticism and I&#039;d really like to learn as much as I can. My goal for the remainder of the year and next is to be comfortable with at least five champions per lane, have better decision making and more confidence and hopefully reach gold: even if it&#039;s only a baby level of gold :&lt;\r\n\r\nI&#039;m still super new to LoL, been playing for around two months but these are some of my favourite champions so far..\r\n\r\n{{champion:90}} \r\n{{champion:1}} \r\n{{champion:16}} \r\n{{champion:9}} \r\n{{champion:63}} \r\n\r\nI&#039;d prefer to &#039;main&#039; mid or support, but whatever suits me best I&#039;d like to be around people who can continuously help me grow. The reason I have a 5 per lane proficiency goal is so that I learn the champions and learn how to play against them in those primary roles I&#039;m interested in. I&#039;m not a hardcore player, but I want to reduce silly mistakes I make and have an environment to practice in.\r\n\r\n I have around 9 levels to go til Lv. 30, so I haven&#039;t touched ranked yet but I&#039;ve been following Worlds&#039; and I just really enjoy this game. Some people are super nice, some are really mean, but I think that&#039;s really just the nature of MOBAs and I don&#039;t take it personally. I figure if I can find a group of players or a club to spend some time with I could really enjoy the game better.\r\n\r\n:D Thanks guys,\r\n\r\nTam/Little Fishstix","replies":[{"poster":"YukiHikado","date":"2017-12-09T15:54:31.757+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Ye I can teach ya","replies":[]},{"poster":"≈Åeader","date":"2017-10-16T12:48:09.068+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey, I'm more than willing to help you improve in League.
