Please check my score.\n\nThe renekton did pretty well at top, I helped gank a lot, barely touched my jungle mobs because I was so busy ganking (they were many levels below the average, so it was really easy to kill them, however I was just constantly banking that there wasn&#039;t time to clear them)\n\nJust look at my score - 17 /4/12, highest damage done on team, lots of self mitigated damage, highest damage to objectives (on my team), highest gold earned, etc.\n\nBut I got an A+, whilst the renekton got an S-... I don&#039;t get it??\n\nthis is the link to the game btw. Please help!?

You had 107, VERY low for a 30 min game.\n\nGrades are not determined by how well you did in the team, but how well you did compared to other Jarvan Jungles on OCE. S grades are the top percentages of scores. Having kills that match with those top scores is great, but if your CS is way below them, you aren't going to snag the S. Renekton may have been low on the score spectrum, but his CS was likely well above most of those top scores, which is why he got the S.\n\nTo get the S grades, you have to do well at all aspects of the game, not just one or two, because the one or two you do badly in, will drag down your score a lot.","replies":[]}]}
