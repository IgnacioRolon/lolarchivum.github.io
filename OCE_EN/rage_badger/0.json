They're constantly putting out in-depth articles detailing what's coming up, offering user satisfaction polls, and so on, but then they seem to ignore it all and do what people aren't really interested in anyway sometimes.\n\nAmbient client sounds should definitely be separately adjustable from client alerts. I need to be able to hear when the queue pops a match, but then there's this super loud ringing and clanging and crap for 10 seconds after and constant chiming noises during the lobby process that I just want to shut up. It takes minutes to get into a match, and that's if the lobby doesn't dodge which is often does, and I take very little of it to do my part, but when I try to watch some Youtube in the meantime the ambient sounds are insufferable. I just want to hear important alerts for when I need to pick or accept something, and nothing else. However for your situation, if you're just idling in the client and want to hear invites then do so in the main landing screen, there is no ambient sound there. It's only when you sit in the pre-lobby area will it be making noise.","replies":[{"poster":"JasonWazza","date":"2017-11-19T07:40:23.273+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":">but then they seem to ignore it all and do what people aren't really interested in anyway sometimes.\n\nWelcome to the world of big corporations, look like you give a shit while you rake the cash in and don't give a fuck.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Essembie","date":"2017-11-19T07:56:45.446+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Riot have always been very responsive to the market and their constant revisions have kept them neck and neck with any main competitors that come into the mix and there is always pressure to ensure that they dont fall behind in an area where a competitor is excelling, eg:\n\nhttps://www.kotaku.com.au/2015/06/league-and-dota-2-are-both-becoming-a-bit-more-like-heroes-of-the-storm/\n\n(there was another really good article which articulated this better than I can but I cant find it).\n\nBut these were all gameplay related just to make sure that LoL could offer a similar experience to its players without letting the competition get an edge.\n\nWidely accepted, though, was that the FTP model in League was streets ahead of the rest. But sadly, it looks like they've copied the blizzard loot box model which is utterly infuriating for older players like me who are turned off at the thought of burning a sh!t load of cash for the \"chance\" to get something. And not to mention this is an exploitative model which preys upon the addictive personalities of younger people perhaps not yet able to know the value of cash (because they are not forking out their own) and not emotionally aware enough to realise that they are getting fleeced.\n\nReally disagree with the direction that BE / IP / RP have gone.","replies":[]}]}
