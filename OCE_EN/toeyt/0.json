Just today there was a super mega toxic AF Sivir on my team and she called our jungler autistic all game long for not ganking more and blamed everyone one else for her deaths.. it was true horror and after the game finished I reported her and about 5 or so minuets later I got a pop up message saying that that person had been punished. This was very nice to see. It proves that the report system works and also over the few years I have played I have seen less and less toxic behavior (not that there isn't any). So I think we just have to put up with it for the time being and keep reporting and giving honors to people who deserve them.
