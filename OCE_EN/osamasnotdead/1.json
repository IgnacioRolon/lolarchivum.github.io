Anyway im sick of the negative attitude against normal people like myself people need to grow up and be more mature because OCE  has a bad reputation for Verbal abuse and i feel as if the &quot;Negative Attitude&quot; Report category doesnt really do anything , So anyway the point of this was to open up some ideas on what could help OCE become a friendlier server that everyone can enjoy , thanks guys . and  as allways NO HATE PLS {{champion:32}}  {{item:3070}}","replies":[{"poster":"ArcticHorizon","date":"2015-07-26T06:51:49.315+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Not getting thanks is very different from being toxic. Asking for thanks looks like you feel entitled to praise, and is bound to piss people off. \n\n_\"...the thanks I deserve...\" - Osamasnotdead 2015_ \n\nYou never DESERVE a thanks. Just appreciate it when it comes. Not saying thanks isn't a sign of disrespect or rudeness when your DUTY is to protect your team. It's an entirely neutral action and deserves no more than a neutral response.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Iosua Bot","date":"2015-07-27T04:37:39.899+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Do remember it's not only our community that is toxic, i mean, if you fuk up someones promos @ N.A, how do you think they'll feel?\nSo it's not only us that needs improvement, it's just about everyone that needs to shape up, needs to get 'big' :P","replies":[]},{"poster":"TeCoolMage","date":"2015-07-26T13:03:44.370+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thank others before you thank yourself, then it'll come naturally.","replies":[]},{"poster":"heartbr0ken","date":"2015-07-26T00:29:11.798+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"So basically you're whining that the community is toxic because they didn't say thank you?\nAlthough I don't understand why they'd write 'Report for being toxic' if you're just asking for acknowledgement.\n\n'People need to grow up' Maybe you need to grow up. If you cannot withstand a game with people you don't even know saying thank you, then you need to learn to not just break up emotionally when someone doesn't say thanks.","replies":[]},{"poster":"AdjW","date":"2015-07-25T23:48:16.502+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I just have to say that asking for people to say thank you its not as innocent as you might think it is. Its nobodies responsibility to thank you for anything, they can do it on their own free will as they please if people decide not to thank you regardless of how remarkable the act you just performed is don't ask for praise and don't complain when you don't receive any because if you do your essentially just poking a sleeping animal that's not going to love you for disturbing it but only try and take a chunk out of you for \"appearing\" as an attention whore. As for the rest I agree that there are some bad seeds among us on this server but that's a constant given where there is always \"good\" there is always going to be \"evil\" to some degree. So basically just queue up don't ask for praise because if you do 9/10 times you'll get anything but that and hope you get some half decent people because outrooting all the \"toxic\" players is impossible.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Talon12","date":"2015-07-25T22:07:26.258+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"its oce, you can't change this.\n\nas for this\n> Everytime i have asked people say thanks i get responses like \" go cry to your mum noob\" or \"Report for being toxic\"\n\n80% of the time if you say gj, they will say it back to you","replies":[]}]}
