I have had this problem since Windows 8.1. I sent support tickets to Riot but they just replied with tips like \"open with admin\" and other stuff that I would have obviously tried before asking them as a final resort. They haven't really bothered to fix this problem for a while and its probably going to take a long time until they actually start looking into it. I haven't been able to play for 1.5 months and I have spent a lot of money on a game that won't even open. Just switch to another game at this point.","replies":[]}]}
