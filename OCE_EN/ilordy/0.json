You should always start Flask + Pots (Unless against an AD mid, start Cloth + 5) as Fizz's abilities already deal a lot of damage, and your focus in the early laning phase should be making efficient trades, not all-inning your opponent from full health. \n\n**Fizz has 3 main power spikes during his laning phase:**\n\n**Level 2**\nAs soon as you hit level 2, your W>Q + 1-2 auto attacks is a very efficient trade. On the second trade, you can often get a kill with an all-in. Do not commit for more than 1-2 auto attacks or the trade will not be efficient.\n\n**Level 3**\nAt level 3, you have all 3 of your moves and can out trade most lane opponents, provided you use your moves effectively. There are 2 ways to trade at level 3, which will depend on your lane opponent:\n1. Dodge your opponent's ability with E and land on top of them. Activate W, auto attack a couple of times and then Q either your opponent or to the minion wave for safety, depending on lane positioning.\n2. Same as your level 2 trade, but use E after the 1-2 auto attacks and depending on how the trade is going, you may be able to sneak another auto or two in after you land. You can also use E in this trade to dodge abilities with a warm-up time, such as Cho'Gath Rupture or Jayce's Q\n\n**Level 6**\nThis is Fizz's biggest power spike, and you should almost always be able to get a kill once hitting level 6. Two tips to ensure you secure this kill are:\n1. Do not all-in if they are at full health. Make sure you have had one successful trade before you all-in.\n2. Do not initiate the fight with your ultimate, it is far too easy to dodge at long range and you lose all of your kill potential if you miss. Instead, initiate in the same ways at level 2-3, and use your ultimate at close range to guarantee it hits.\n\nPast level 6, Fizz has extremely good wave clear which opens up a lot of roam potential. If you are doing well, you can clear waves by auto attacking the melee minions once and then using E on top of the wave. You will get a feel for the damage you can do to minions at each stage of the game as you play more.\n\nHope this helps, happy fishing!","replies":[]}]}
