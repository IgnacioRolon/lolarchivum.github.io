Use devices that are properly configured to connect to the internet properly, as well as respect the bandwidth of other users.\n2. Tell the other users to disable services like sync and location so that it's not constantly pinging the internet, thus reducing bandwidth.\n3. Tell the other users to lower the amount of bandwidth they are using, if possible. Some applications will even allow you to throttle your connection (though nearly all of them don't).\n4. Get a better ISP, or one that will specifically support multiple users.\n5. Create a schedule as to who uses the internet when. If not that extreme, then maybe a schedule for when someone wants to do something bandwidth-intensive, like streaming videos or syncing devices.\n6. Go to an internet cafe.\n\nCan't really think of anything more off the top of my head. The absolutely best option is to just get another internet source, but as you said, you don't want to use any \"new routers\", so that's out of the question.\n\nBest of luck.","replies":[]}]}
