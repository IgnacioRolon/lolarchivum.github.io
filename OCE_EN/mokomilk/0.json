It's been happening for a while now and it comes to a point that AFK is a form of cheating to offer the players a free win, VICEVERSA.\n\nThis way players have to spend more time playing LoL.\n\nMakes allot of sense to keep doing the DC and AFK during a promo game etc.\n\nHow else are they going to retain their customer base to keep playing over and over because of that \"certain\" game.  Have you ever notice that the \"DC and AFK\" mostly ocurr during those important games?\n\nI sure there is some sort of psychology behind the 40mins games with League.\n\n2 cent","replies":[]},{"poster":"King Crow","date":"2017-05-04T17:47:06.598+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yes rito, same here.
