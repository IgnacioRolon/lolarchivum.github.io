If i manage to climb to silver 5 even though my MMR is lower compare to the average silver 5, I deserved all the hard-work i put into it. stop penalizing me just because my MMR isn&#039;t within your standard","replies":[{"poster":"RHIN0","date":"2016-05-23T23:57:31.620+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"if you are getting low amounts of lp gain compared to what you lose, its because you have the MMRof ranks below you, therefore playing with and against people below your rank. This can also work the other way, so higher MMR = vs higher ranked players = more lp per win\n\nmany people in div5 (silver5, gold5...) tend to get really low MMR because it is so hard to demote in those ranks, just keep playing and if you keep a positive win rate, You will eventually have a normal or higher MMR\n\nand to answer your question about set amounts of lp gain/loss. Do you think a Silver5 who is vs people in bronze2, should get the same LP per win as a Silver5 who is vs people in Silver2?","replies":[]}]}
