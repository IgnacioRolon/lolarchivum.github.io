In the meantime, try playing a custom match and selecting the Chroma that you'd like so it is set to default for when you play your new Champ Select match. This was a known workaround for the same problem in Team Builder, so let me know if it works.\n\n-DTN","replies":[{"poster":"CyberDuck277","date":"2016-01-19T22:25:20.287+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Doesn't seem to work, thanks anyway","replies":[]}]}]}
