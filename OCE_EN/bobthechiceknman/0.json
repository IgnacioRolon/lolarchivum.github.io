This doesn't apply to first-time offenders. You have left games in the past.\n\nIf you're having issues with your internet connection, then it is expected of you to fix those before entering into match-made games again. There is no way of the server being able to detect that you didn't purposefully leave the game (even though it's *technically* intentional), and thus you won't get your penalty removed. It also goes against Riot's policy of \"We will not change any penalties applied to players by Leavebuster\".\n\nIf you're using a wireless connection to play League, have you tried moving yourself closer to the source so that you don't cut out as often? If you have other people using the connection at the same time, perhaps get them to stop using it while you play?","replies":[]}]}
