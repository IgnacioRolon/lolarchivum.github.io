Sadly this time I picked a support and lost the game. I&#039;ve reported every time I see bots and I never see any of them get processed. Does Riot not take care of these and do they not look at reports from a single person in the game? Every coop vs ai game I play once in a while, there are at least 2 scripters in every game (literally).\n\nIt&#039;s fucking stupid and it wastes my time when I just play it to get the win of the day; makes 15 minute game take 30 minutes, and I&#039;ve just lost one sadly.\n\nRemove my fucking history of losing to coop vs ai intermediate because its embarrassing and please process my reports.","replies":[{"poster":"Ing√©nue","date":"2016-02-13T01:27:33.607+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"See this link [here](http://boards.oce.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/player-behaviour/GX0QneKT-riot-when-are-you-going-to-do-something-about-all-the-bot-players) or [here](http://boards.oce.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/miscellaneous/wOXr9Vo8-bots-destroying-the-game)","replies":[]}]}
