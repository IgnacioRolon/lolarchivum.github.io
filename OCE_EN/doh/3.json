They only have seem to read MY CHATs and ignored what others have said to me or what they did during the game. They provided me chat log for 3 games, in 2 of them which other players instantly locked champions despite people calling lanes at the beginning (normal games). I have not said anything abusive unless other people have said anything abusive to me. Worst thing I have said there was are you bronze 5, toxic, stfu (once when a player was using very abusive language).\n\nIs it human reviewing those? or is it just macro that randomly bans and sends these chat logs? Or do they just read what I said and do not consider all the circumstances? If I go in a game and start just decide deliberately not to cooperate or just pick any champion and go to any lane I want (Janna jungle) or walk into towers and teammates say something bad to me (I've only sworn once; stfu which is just an acronym), and if I report them will they get banned? This is ridiculous. If this is the case just remove your chat function during the game as I'm done with this or create a function where you can mute others from beginning of the game. If a random guy walking down the street walks up to you and start swearing and talks about your mother, would you just walk away or say something back? This was the case for what I have done and I have never started the flame.\n\nPlease read over the whole text (not just mine, include what they have said to me) and watch the game, and consider all the circumstances before accusing people of doing such an act.","replies":[{"poster":"Maraudaur","date":"2016-02-02T01:19:34.622+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey Doh,\n\nA 10 game chat restriction is definitely one of our lighter punishments (we have 14 day bans and also permanent bans). The reason you have received these chat restrictions is because your language and the way you talk to others have been deemed negative by our community. This is an opportunity for you to reevaluate how you communicate with your team mates so that you can change and prevent further, more severe punishments.\n\nYou say you have been provoked in most of your cases, due to other circumstances. While I understand once in awhile there might be a negative player or troll or afk and it can be extremely frustrating (I've been playing this game for 4+ years!). That doesn't mean you need to be rude or negative back towards those players. Two wrongs do not make a right. Play the game, maybe mute them if you would like. There is no need to pay attention to rude players. Play your game and report them at the end game lobby.\n\nJust want to point out here, the people provoking you will receive punishments too. It's just by stooping to their level you're effectively behaving exactly like the people that receive punishments which in turn gets you punished too. It would be much better to just ignore them.\n\n> If a random guy walking down the street walks up to you and start swearing and talks about your mother, would you just walk away or say something back?\n\nIf some random guy did that to me I would definitely just ignore him and keep going about my business, for a few reasons. \nA) I probably don't want to get involved with a person like that, if they go around doing that to random people there is probably something wrong with them\nB) I have better things to do than stop what I am doing and get in an argument with a person that clearly has problems and nothing better to do. If I reacted and stooped to the random guys level what do you think everyone else on the street would see? Just two random crazies swearing at each other for no reason at all.\n\nTo be honest, I have never been in that situation in real life.\n\nIf you want to learn more about our Player Behaviour systems check this out - http://boards.oce.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/announcements/L65wrRYe-player-behaviour-faq-updated-for-instant-feedback\n\nI'm always happy to chat more as well if you have more questions.","replies":[]}]}
