Players like you are a tiny minority so it's not exactly something that comes up often. You didn't get screwed, it couldn't give you something you didn't have so it just gave you a permanent shard like it was meant to.\n\nThere have been issues with login transitions with support at the moment. Generally logging into support via an incognito/private window or logging out of the website (boards) first functions as a temporary workaround.","replies":[{"poster":"DarkCresent","date":"2018-04-07T08:06:54.083+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Ok thanks, I still think it should warn u that you own all skins even if I am the minority, client functionality should not be linked to how much of the base it might apply to just whether it makes sense or not and how costly it is 2 implement,\nand while you say it didn't screw mem I respectfuly disagree, it kinda did as it turned 3 skin shards worth 600 gold essences into a skin permanent worth 300 gold essence, that I can never activate and only disenchant and I lose the reroll for when new skins come out \n\nas for the login, ill try using incognito  but generally if its a cache or settings problem switching browser should have the same effect, if not ill try relogging a few times","replies":[{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2018-04-07T08:24:52.750+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Anything further you'll have to take up with support, they may be able to refund you the shards or the essence but I am unsure what their procedure would be.\n\nIf you're still struggling with the support site you can also reach out to them on Twitter:\nhttps://twitter.com/RiotSupport","replies":[]}]}]}]}
