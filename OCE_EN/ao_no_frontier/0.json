Because I stopped playing Flex after being matched with Golds and Plats (I'm B5 in Flex). But apparently, according to Riot Support, that's \"normal\" for Flex. \n\nIf it's SoloQ, then I know Silvers can play vs Bronze and Golds as well, since they're within a tier of Silver (but Bronze can't play with Gold).\n\nIt also depends on where in Silver you are. If you're S2 or S1, playing against Golds shouldn't be surprising.\n\nBut if you're S5, then maybe you either have a high MMR, or the Golds have a low MMR (you only need to have a lower than normal MMR to drop divisions, but you need an MMR a whole league below to to drop a Tier). \n\nIf they are Gold 5 with a Silver 3 or 4 MMR, then it's not low enough to drop them into Silver 1, but low enough to match them with Silver 4 and 5. This is also why you sometimes see Silver 5 players in Bronze 4 games. \n\n**TL; DR:** Either you're a high enough Silver (or have a high enough Silver MMR) that you're playing with low Golds, or the Golds are so bad that their MMR is low Silver level (but not low enough to demote them).","replies":[]}]}
