Are we ever going to properly get either mode? I&#039;ve grown to resent Summoner&#039;s Rift &amp; ARAM is only good for small sessions so lately I simply haven&#039;t played the game at all.\r\n\r\nSo is there anything, anything at all that can be said about TT, TT ranked &amp; Dominion for Oce? You&#039;ve been running the TT tests for a while now but we&#039;ve not heard of any progress yet so I gave up enjoying the few hours you gave us for that a while ago, lately I&#039;ve been feeling that it&#039;s but only a tease so if I can&#039;t have it all the time, or at least most of the time then I don&#039;t really want it at all.","replies":[]}
