It puts you somewhere between your original rank and Silver III or so, but closer to the original rank than Silver III. Depending on how low you were (i.e. if you were Bronze V 0 LP) you'll end up pretty low.\n\nI'm guessing you were right at the bottom last season so you ended up being put close to that.\n\nWhere you get placed is irrelevant anyway. Focus on improvement and you'll naturally rise. I was at your rank (Bronze V) when I started ranked too, it's not hard to get out if you have a positive mindset.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"BarryButcher","date":"2015-02-14T10:06:15.518+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"And what rank were you last season?
