Of course there are some that maybe have never played ranked before, got unlucky in placements, and genuinely don't belong in B5 but rather say S something and want to get boosted out of B5 so they have a shot. I've never been as low as B5 (B3 was my lowest at placement) but B3 was bad enough. As a supp main it's near impossible to carry (if you don't play soraka) so I had a friend help me up. Not saying you should get Diamonds to play in Bronze, but they can't just delete the duo experience, a lot of people would never touch ranked again.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Bee Happy","date":"2015-10-17T22:04:07.137+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Carrying like that is allowed, theres even posts about it on the forums (see below), what isnt allowed is logging into their account to boost them.\n\nhttp://boards.oce.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/team-recruitment/3QGEowPx-willing-to-carry-any-girl-to-diamond-via-duo","replies":[]},{"poster":"TOXIC Devourer","date":"2015-10-17T13:31:10.320+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Just report with a support ticket, I regularly report boosters/botters this way, it's pretty easy to spot an account that's being boosted.","replies":[]},{"poster":"trolledallmylife","date":"2015-10-17T10:19:43.984+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"riot has given 0 fks since the dawn of time\n\nif more people leave then they will do something about!","replies":[]}]}
