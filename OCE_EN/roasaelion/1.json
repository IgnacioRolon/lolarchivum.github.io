Able to play supportive junglers exceptionally well. All i need is a carry or two to make immortal. \n\nVery experienced with itemization, counters and off-meta specific counters. Analysis of enemy composition is what i do - countering it with flex/tech picks is how i win (or heavily counter) solo queue.\n\nBored of solo queue meta, just want to team up and win-win-win - HELL i'll even join a tourney if i can.\n\nI&#039;ve got an entire year with nothing but free time. Easiest way to contact me is through the client - will read forums posts tomorrow., ign **_Roasaelion_**\nhttp://oce.op.gg/summoner/userName=roasaelion","replies":[{"poster":"TDawgAesthetic","date":"2016-11-15T03:57:17.999+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey there man, add me so we can have a game i am also an ADC main","replies":[]},{"poster":"ItsJustNam","date":"2016-11-10T08:34:38.566+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey man,although iam only silver5,I do think iam a really good adc.\nI will add you and i think you will be pleased with how i play.\nA few normal games willl show you\n:D","replies":[]}]}
