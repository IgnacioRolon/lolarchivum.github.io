Balancing around the ward, gives Riot a chance to emphasize unique champion strengths rather then being held back by, 'Oh this champion walks into lane invisible.\"\n\nOr\n\nWill {{champion:28}} , {{champion:29}}  and {{champion:35}}  have their power severely chopped down and left to rot?\n\nWhat do you think","replies":[{"poster":"DiamondAries","date":"2015-02-28T12:58:55.134+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Where is the \"Neither this game should not do anything to stealth champs who rely on it to function\" vote button?\n\nAlso, I'm very happy that Teemo wasn't in that list :)","replies":[]},{"poster":"Crusader charlie","date":"2015-02-26T23:09:18.928+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I have got to say I think that having stealth based champions in the game *without having stealth* is really a terrible idea.\nI mean evelynn's stealth practically died when you could see her without a ward, and what's the point of playing her now?\n\nI mean really, stealth champions are exactly that. *stealth* champions.\nand if they can't turn invisible they just can't be *stealth* champions because league of legends, sadly, is not a first person shooter","replies":[]}]}
