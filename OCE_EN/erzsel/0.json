Absolute unfair and waste of time. Why is there no protection against a sudden high ping in the client instead of punishing players who did nothing wrong?","replies":[{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2018-06-14T09:29:37.908+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Because it's very easy to spoof internet issues and to offer such protection would see it very quickly abused.\n\nFor genuine connection issues, it shouldn't be happening very often, so shouldn't be much of a concern.\nIf the issues are consistent, you probably shouldn't be playing ranked to begin with.\nAllowing extra time sounds all well and good, but then what's the point of a timer at all, and where's the assurance you won't be lagging in game as well?","replies":[]}]}
