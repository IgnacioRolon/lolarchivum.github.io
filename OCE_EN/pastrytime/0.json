After some roster changes  the squad has been re-invigorated and playing in the same form that won them their first major in mid 2014, in a thrilling best of five against none other than their opponents for today!\r\n\r\nLegacy have maintained a winning record against the Chiefs in longer sets, but may struggle in a single regular season game.\r\n\r\nMomentum is key as we move into playoffs and while both teams are guaranteed to make it, securing points and perhaps a mental edge is still worth plenty late in the season.\r\n\r\nSo what do you think of the matchup? We&#039;d love to hear your thoughts!
