I didn&#039;t realise you could get permanently banned and I do apologise for not being a sportsmanlike player however if their is any chance I could possibly have my perma ban reduced to 14 days as I am a loyal customer that has spent over 1000 dollars on the game. I will never be toxic again now that i realise how serious the new consequences are. In addition please read over text below as I&#039;m not sure if it&#039;s even ban worthy?

Only players here :)\n\nAs for your punishment, there are a few things that would be helpful in establishing why this would have triggered a punishment.\n\nHave you had any previous punishments? If you have previously received a 14 day suspension, you would have been told in your reform card that continued negative behaviour will result in a permanent suspension of your account.\n\nDo you have negative history? This one is harder for the player themselves to establish, but logs like these (assuming it's unedited) being punished is usually because they're 'the straw that broke the camels back'. If you're the kind of player that accumulates valid (but not punishment worthy reports) and negative history in a lot of games, oftentimes the logs offered for the game that finally pushed you over into punishment can be quite tame.\n\nWas the log accompanied by gameplay offences? You mention things like not ganking a certain player, but that isn't punishment worthy. If however some intent feeding was involved it is.\n\n___\n\nTo quickly clear up a few common misconceptions as well:\n\n>I am a loyal customer that has spent over 1000 dollars on the game\n\nThe amount of money spent on the game is irrelevant to punishments. All players are treated equally for their behaviour.\n\n>I have seen far worse players out there\n\nThere are a few different 'paths' that lead to a permanent suspension. For chat, essentially it's either a short trip with serious violations of the rules (like racism, homophobia etc) or a long trip through the four punishment tiers (2 chat restrictions, 14 day ban, perma ban) with consistent but relatively speaking minor violations of the rules.\n\n___\n\nI don't know exactly what the case is with your punishment, but if you want to know, some more info would be really helpful in establishing that.","replies":[{"poster":"Botlane Genocide","date":"2018-05-06T13:04:19.674+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"I think I was muted and banned but I didn't see it state anywhere that the next time is permanent.

I don't know the circumstances of your punishment, but if it is valid, you won't get any transfers, that's the whole point of a permanent ban. If it was an invalid punishment it will be revoked.\n\n>No I would never intentionally feed **on my main account**\n\nThe way you say that is frankly concerning. It says you wouldn't int on your main because it has personal value to you, not because it's generally a shit thing to do, and that you'd be happy to int on a smurf because it has little value to you. The implications don't exactly prompt much faith in your innocence.\n\n___\n\nI would recommend submitting a support ticket asking for a punishment review. If nothing else, they should be able to give you more context as to why this punishment was issued: https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/requests/new\n\nDon't submit more than one ticket, or reply to the ticket before you get a response from support unless absolutely necessary. Doing either will bump you back to the bottom of the queue.\n\nDon't expect a long response. Support don't have a lot of time, so they will answer what you ask and nothing more. If you ask if the punishment was valid, you will only get a yes or no. If you want context, you'll have to ask for it. \n\nIf you have any concerns with your correspondence with support, I encourage you to post your tickets and their responses here and we (who have more time than they do) can walk you through them. Please remove any identifying info like names before doing so (public forum and all that).","replies":[]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Smurfin USA","date":"2018-05-02T14:23:39.415+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"Honestly nothing out of the average.\n\nI see worse coming from the Chinese players, and because it's not written in English riot doesn't give two fucks about it.\n\nUndeserved ban","replies":[{"poster":"CNFAAGFKU","date":"2018-05-03T01:47:43.886+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"You know rito belongs to China.
