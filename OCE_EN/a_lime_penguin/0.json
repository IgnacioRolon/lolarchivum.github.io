Before this issue i had 32 ping every game and the connection was smooth. I contacted my internet provider, iinet and they said the connection and ping is good on their end ( 15 ping, 6.5 mbps download). They are not sure if there is a problem at all despite the obvious ping issues I have been experiencing. Just wondering if its something on Riot&#039;s end in terms of the servers?","replies":[{"poster":"Mindstar","date":"2015-10-26T07:15:44.456+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey,\n\nThanks for putting in the info on your ISP and location :)  How long has this been happening for?  I wasn't able to see any sign of an issue around the time of your post.\n\nIt might be worth looking at your game logs using [Logs of Lag](http://logsoflag.com/), and possibly check out the support page for [Troubleshooting Connection Issues](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues)?\n\nCan you provide a [traceroute](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752674-Network-System-and-League-of-Legends-Logs#wq2) to 103.240.227.1 ?\n\nLet me know how you go.\n\nCheers\nMindstar","replies":[]}]}
