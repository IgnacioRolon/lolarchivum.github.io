After all, this client is going to be the fresh new face of LoL and will be used by millions across a range of demographics and platforms.\n\nI realise that it&rsquo;s only been open for a few hours now, and I&rsquo;ve given it a pretty intense look already. For the areas that are open, it seems relatively smooth.\n\nI am testing the Mac Client on El Capitan V10.11.5. 2015&rdquo; Mid &rsquo;15 Retina Display.\nLeague Client: V2440279.2439472.\n\n_Ok, let&rsquo;s jump in:_\n\n**General**\n&bull; The client occasionally flickers when remaining idle for a short time.\n&bull; A way to minimise the friends list like in the previous client. It feels like it&rsquo;s obscuring the right side of the screen. This will allow the &lsquo;Find Match&rsquo; button and other important items to be centred in the clients frame. This is by far the most annoying thing I've found to date.\n&bull; It&rsquo;s currently using 42-50% of CPU. With a solid 42.2% whilst being idle.\n&bull; There&rsquo;s 4 processes running with League Client in their name. Using 2%, 10%, 20% and 42% CPU respectively.\n\n**Play Loop**\nThis involves the main function of the client &mdash; to queue up for games.\nA basic user task is to press play, choose a game mode, queue and enter champion select. \nAfter the game has ended, the end of game scoreboard will present itself.\n\nHave not found a problem on the front end of the game.\n\n**End game Screen**\nChat in bottom left seems really REALLY small width wise, I strongly recommend increasing that.\nFull stats are not available, and linking to the match history website kind of defeats the purpose. (Why should the old client have something better than the new client?)\n\n\n**Champion Select**\nChampion select masteries feel slower to choose, this may just be a scroll-wheel thing, but it's really challenging to see what's going on.\n\n**Friends List &amp; Chat**\nMessaging offline friends to Mobile:\nSent messages are not in chronological order. They appear randomly and sometimes seperate the same day into a different category.\n**Example: ** Saturday, Friday, Today, Yesterday, Saturday.\n\nRecommended Friends (Facebook Friends) are not supported.\n\nThis version of the client does not currently support clubs.","replies":[{"poster":"Lalna","date":"2016-05-20T12:47:46.742+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"I would have to strongly agree with an option to minimize the friends list. I mainly use windows but installed it on my 2014 macbook pro just to see and it does indeed use a huge amount of cpu just idling, my fans were all full blast after 5 minutes.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Mindstar","date":"2016-05-19T01:18:20.458+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thanks for the detailed feedback! I'm going to pass your notes on to our dev team so they can check it out :)\n\nFor the bugs that you have noticed - (eg. flickering, CPU usage, chat message ordering) - have you sent in bug reports for those using the \"Report a bug\" button in the client?  This is the best and most reliable way to get us feedback when you encounter issues.\n\nGreat to have you along for the Alpha journey! :)\n\nCheers!\nMindstar","replies":[{"poster":"CrunchingNinja","date":"2016-05-19T08:39:52.249+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hi,\n\nI'm not sure if this would be much help, but the CPU usage might be caused by the use of CEF and increased animations (I mainly notice the spikes when going into the play section and performing actions there).","replies":[]},{"poster":"Cardboard","date":"2016-05-19T01:33:57.172+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hi there, \nI've edited my post with some more notes amongst it.\n\nThanks","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Hikky","date":"2016-05-19T07:34:00.689+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'm also not 100% sold on the chat bar being always open.
