This caused issues with my gf who couldn&#039;t understand how I could get so caught up in it.\r\n\r\nMy solution? Introduce her to the game.\r\n\r\nThis worked well, she is a gamer and so far has enjoyed playing with me and my friends on our smurfs, however I realise I have no idea how to teach her how to play, it has just become second nature to me.\r\n\r\nSo my questions to everyone here is: What made you a better player? What do you wish someone had of shown you when you first started? What is the best way to teach players new to MOBA&#039;s the skills to play these types of games?\r\n\r\nThanks in advance to anyone who takes the time to reply!\r\n\r\n-nightang3L","replies":[{"poster":"HumanbeastOM","date":"2017-01-25T00:26:22.693+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"i can say,simply playing the game..practice practice practice..however...the best way to learn is to watch experts in motion...go watch some pro games and have a research session with her,work around a champ they like,perhaps one that has good skill shots..learning to how to move,where to place your mouse,how to anticipate and read the map for players to strategize..","replies":[]},{"poster":"DipperOCE","date":"2017-01-25T14:48:15.119+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"make her main the no skill support champions or lux","replies":[{"poster":"Nightjar","date":"2017-01-26T01:31:07.360+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"lux isn't no skill, a bad lux can miss 100% of her skillshots and be less useful than a full ap zed.

Also since these champions aren't mechanically difficult, they will give her alot more time to watch the map and also learn how to flash and use summoners and item actives. Especially rammus, he can easily farm without even looking at the jungle camps and all these champions are kinda easy to play without locked screen due to having windup skillshots (sivir q, fizz ult, Son ult, Poppy ult).\n\nCongrats and goodluck with your gf, hope you two become the best duo ever.","replies":[]}]}
