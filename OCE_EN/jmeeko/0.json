Rito support gave me the 'tough titties son' and I tried to tell them there's an issue with LB.\n**\n\n\nGuessing those reading this has had some issues with LeaverBuster (LB) like me (or you're just curious about this topic).\n\nSo about a week ago, I was playing a ranked match, and it ended up being a 3v5 (drag right?) so me and my remaining two team members 'gave up' and let them push and win. During this time (this is important) I was buying things and just 'having fun' (placing wards, taunting, running around, etc) and their team weren't being bm so they let us live and do our thing.\nAfter the game I got a notice saying that LB has detected AFK behaviour and has punished you to 5 'lower priority queue' (have to wait 5min before queueing for 5 games).\nI didn't deserve this, I wasn't doing anything wrong.\n\nI contacted OCE support saying that I think there may be an issue with LB and this might be an issue for other players, etc. I got a generic, ill, inattentive reply which was \"We can't lift you 5 game punishment\". I was pissed off about this reply because I wasn't asking them to do that, rather addressing a possible issue. 2 or 3 replies later from other LoL support team members until I got \"I will get [someone from some support branch] to talk to you about it\". That was 5 days ago - no one has gotten back to me. \n\nI like to think my account is in good standing, I am a paying customer (not that I'm saying that to get special treatment, but saying it because) I wouldn't want to jeopardise a possible ban on my account for being AFK, so I make sure I'm a good boy for Rito.\n\nSo my question is: Has LB done wrong by anyone else? I would like to hear some stories about what happened to see if there's a link and maybe to point Rito in the right direction to fix this (if they care).\n\n*EDIT: I wasn't sitting in the base. I was following the other two members on my team (who didnt get LB punishment after game). I got the message right after the game, leaving no time for people to report me for AFK, and the enemy team were sympathetic so doubt they reported. My previous games I wasn't AFK or anything either.*","replies":[{"poster":"Gehirn","date":"2015-03-11T00:21:24.589+0000","up_votes":8,"down_votes":1,"body":"Hi JMeeko,\n\n**TL;DR: Your recent Leave/AFK history led to being Leaverbusted after this game. Leaverbuster picking you up here is intended, just unfortunate that you got busted for this game given your intentions.**\n\nI took some time to check out your profile and figure out exactly what happened.\n\nAs for why you were hit by Leaverbuster:\n- in the last few months you've been detected has having left or AFK'd in 2% of your games. It may not seem like much but it is above the normal rate for unintended disconnects.\n- the last game you were detected as AFK in was a ranked game, which are rated much more harshly than normals. Given your recent history, this was enough to put you into the lowest punishment threshold for Leaverbuster which is a 5 min low priority queue for a few games.\n\nAs for why you were detected as AFK in the game you described:\n- Along with just being afk at fountain and not moving, staying in your base and not contributing for a significant amount of time may also be detected as AFK under the Leaverbuster system. Unfortunately, in cases like yours this can mean getting pinged for AFK while letting the enemy push into your base to end a 3v5 asap even if you're moving around. I've been on both sides of this situation and can understand why you'd want to do that.\n\nYou might think that AFK detection should only look for players who strictly leave their champion in place and never move for a certain period of time, but arguments to the contrary are common:\n> - [\"...maybe Leaver Buster should take action on people who dont leave the fountain for a certain amount of time, rather than just people who arent moving.\"](http://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/24d6xa/if_the_leaverbuster_is_working_as_intended_why_is/)\n> - [\"Can the new LeaverBuster detect an afk if he doesnt actually leave but just sit in base trolling?\"](http://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/2nl8d1/question_can_the_new_leaverbuster_detect_an_afk/)\n> - [\"Riot needs to find a way to detect \"fountain sitters\" who are just clicking to avoid being kicked for AFK.\"](http://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/gameplay-balance/v8AUq6G6-leaverbuster-kick-afk-detection-system)\n\nSo in these cases, Leaverbuster isn't broken. Rather it is just as sharp as it needs to be when detecting malicious actions and trolls running around their own Nexus to avoid AFK detection.","replies":[{"poster":"Spidicus","date":"2015-03-11T02:36:50.136+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":2,"body":"\"Unfortunately, in cases like yours this can mean getting pinged for AFK while letting the enemy push into your base to end a 3v5 asap even if you're moving around.

I think that when the game crashes and brings up \"bug splat\" or \"Your game has crashed do you want to reconnect\" to not get a big punishment, because it's not their fault, but people with ping problems and rage quits should get the punishments, because if you have bad ping, do play.
