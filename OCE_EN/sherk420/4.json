If so you should've received a redemptpion code via email for your IP boost.\n\nIf you haven't received your code please firstly check your junk email just in case it’s made its way in there by accident! If you still can’t find it please [contact HOYTS Customer Service](https://hoyts.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/categories/201755258-Cinema) with your online booking number and email address of which your booking was made with. HOYTS will resend your redemption code to the email address of which you made your booking. For security purposes, HOYTS will only be able to resend the same redemption code you would have received and only to the email address of which the booking was made with in the first place.\n\nFor more information check out [this](http://boards.oce.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/community-events/Te5n67OW-hoyts-and-league-of-legends-viewing-parties-update) thread and the [hoyts viewing party page](http://promo.oce.leagueoflegends.com/en/hoyts-viewing-parties/) for more info.","replies":[{"poster":"Sherk420","date":"2016-04-10T11:27:06.486+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hi\nWhat i mean was they had a competition where 6 people had to imitate the 6 banned champions.
