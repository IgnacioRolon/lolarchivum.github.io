(which is what the whole 'legacy, not limited edition' skin line is about. \n2. (more importantly) because it's exploitation of players, and RIOT for all its flaws does actually care about the player base a lot lot more than most companies.\n\nBut unfortunately it means that you cant gift limited/legacy skins, because a black market trade will inevitably come out of it.\n\nI personally don't think there should be ANY limited/legacy skins, everyone should be able to enjoy their favourite champion with any skin they have. The only reason to even have limited/legacy skins is to feel exclusive, and what feeling 'exclusive' really means on a psychological is: \n**\"haha i have something you don't, I'm special and you're not! haha\" **\nWhich in my opinion isn't a nice mindset at all.","replies":[{"poster":"Sherk420","date":"2016-06-07T04:51:36.701+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You're right. it would lead to black marketing\nNow ill wait for the riot skins to come back","replies":[]}]}]}
