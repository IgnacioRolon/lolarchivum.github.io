Sapphire did not seem to be in a prime position, with many issues coming up and causing a defeat.\r\nThe first issue I noticed was that no matter any counter opportunities, Sapphire would only take a prepared build. When John Howard instalocked the Lucian, I was expecting to see a Vayne counter. However, the Sivir had been taken against it. Another was when EvilHag was up against the Viktor, he did not try to dodge abilities, and just allowed Viktor to poke him.\r\nTenacity and leaving power picks open was another problem that Sapphire had.\r\nWhen the Lucian was instalocked, I was also expecting for an Elise to come through, as this can be the advantage that Red Side has: a Counter pick and the opportunity to take a power pick (as there are so many available). With the Lucian, one thing that Sapphire also needed was tenacity, as they could then lock down Lucian before he could dash.\r\nGraves is an excellent jungler, and has many pros. However, the Elise was still open, and she has both Tenacity and a way to reach an enemy. Graves only has the dash, and this meant that Sapphire were giving away too much.\r\nAnother major impacting issue was how kill-greedy Sapphire were. Even though they were low on kills, the players would still rush towards enemies, giving out more kills. Objective focus was not at a high, as all the players just wanted to get kills.\r\nAs seen in the gank on EvilHag, the players would only ward the river bush, and not the smaller exits. This proved fatal, as shown when EvilHag was locked down by Mediocre and killed. \r\nThe last point I will focus on was Cooldowns. This was a major issue, as especially with the Maokai not landing the Twisted Advance on the enemy team, as he was not able to track the Black Shield Cooldown, and it was up whenever Maokai activated Twisted Advance. This also effected other abilities.\r\n\r\nThis is my Junior Analyst Application/Trial.  \r\nThanks for your time. I really appreciate it.\r\n\r\n- Matthew Fulton\r\n\r\nContact Email: soulsifter4355@gmail.com","replies":[{"poster":"Makkam","date":"2016-05-02T04:34:52.366+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"Firstly, why are you posting this as a topic?\n\nSecondly, you have tenacity confused with CC?\n\nThirdly, you would make a terrible analyst.","replies":[{"poster":"Sherk420","date":"2016-05-02T08:15:40.658+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"1: I didn't know where to post it (at school, couldn't communicate with anyone from the team)\n2: Crowd control is the name the community adopted.

But thanks for your opinion\n\nLiterally everything about your analysis is incorrect.\n\nNo, tenacity is not the name for crowd control abilities. Tenacity is the term used for lowering the time you are CC'd.\n\nAnd I don't know what \"I'm not Phreak\" means but if you think you're a better analyst than Phreak you are SORELY mistaken.\n\nYour analysis gives absolutely zero depth into ANY aspect of the team comp, enemy team comp or win conditions for either team. And in the very minor cases you actually attempted to give analysis or ideas, they're wrong in the first place. So Makkam's comment is definitely correct, right now, you would make a terrible analyst. I highly suggest watching some games and trying to figure out WHY things are done rather than WHEN things are done. This could've passed for a low-tier news article rather than an analyst piece.\n\n\nLet this be a warning to anyone who is considering a career in e-sports - this is NOT how you approach it. Do your homework.","replies":[{"poster":"Sherk420","date":"2016-05-02T09:07:29.486+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Ok. I got Tenacity and crowd control mixed up.\n\nWhen im saying \"Im not Phreak\", what im saying isn't that im better than Phreak. Im the complete **OPPOSITE** of Phreak. But i see what you mean.\nIn paragraph 4, i understand what you mean. I do need to work on this. But thanks.\nThis is just a learning curve. This was a rush job, and i didn't analyse like many of the LCS analysts would. But I have many things to learn.
