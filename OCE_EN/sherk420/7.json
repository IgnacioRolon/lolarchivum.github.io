This will not work however having both installed and using one at a time should work just fine (I do it myself)\n\n>With buying the accounts (of lolskinshop or obtgame) is that allowed or not?\n\nAs I said above, no. Any trading, sharing or selling(buying is included in this) of accounts is not allowed.\n\n\n>1.4. Can I share or sell my account or login credentials?
