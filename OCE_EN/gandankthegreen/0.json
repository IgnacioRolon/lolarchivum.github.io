I don't run my car into someone's house because I am \"depressed\" yes?\n\n\"every 5th game or so he would give up and start trolling\"\n\nSo 20% of the time he is not playing like a normal human being. Well done Riot!\n\nPlease pass on my regards to your friend and let him know I am one of those players who will not miss him.

I leave my room maybe twice a day, leaving the house maybe once a week.\nStill, I am perfectly civil in all of my League games.\nIf not having the oppurtunity to troll in a video game drives someone to remain depressed all day though, they really need psychological help, and I say that as someone who is one five times the anti-depressants as the average person with depression.\n\nBasically though, having depression isn't valid reason to be a jerk. Anyone who insists that I am wrong in saying that is a person who I cannot fathom befriending.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Klavinmour","date":"2014-11-29T03:23:48.681+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Your friend's account wont be getting unbanned.\n\nFact of the matter is he acting in a way that ended up in a permaban, he deserved it.\nLeague is not a place to take out your misfortunes in life, there are plenty of get help services where you can deal with depression, League is not one of them.\n\nEveryday you log in you are agreeing to play by the Summoner's Code, your friend refused to do so and got what he deserved.","replies":[]},{"poster":"GanDankTheGreen","date":"2014-11-29T02:46:11.753+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"he has stopped though, he's been playing on one of his other accounts, and he hasn't had a game yet, no matter how bad he went, he wouldn't troll, he even said to me that he was done, with trolling, he didn't want to risk ever being banned again","replies":[{"poster":"DatEpicPotato","date":"2014-11-29T02:48:07.887+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"But isn't that exactly what riot is trying to do by banning people?","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"CRAZIGIRL7","date":"2014-12-07T07:03:55.110+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"They should just QUIT perma banning.
