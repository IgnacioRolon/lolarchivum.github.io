I turned Level 30 ages ago but have only just started playing solo queue. My bronze 3 is only coming out from my placements and am going to rank up. I am now looking for a team that can help each other, kind to each other and encourage each other to become better players. I am 17 years old and from Melbourne. My name is Sam :) I hope you will consider my offer. I can also only play on weekends and holidays because I am in VCE so I would just like it to be casual. \r\nCheers ;)","replies":[{"poster":"iElucidator","date":"2015-03-11T16:55:59.469+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Add me in game, we recently made a new team if you are interested send me a message in game","replies":[]}]}
