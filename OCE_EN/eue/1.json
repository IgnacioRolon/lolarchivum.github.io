We don't need cleanse{{summoner:1}}  or magic resist neither{{item:3140}} {{item:3139}} . What we want is more chance to do dmg on the opponents by surviving for extra 2 to 5 seconds.\n\nBanshee's{{item:3102}}  is not for adc as well. maybe except for Corki{{champion:42}} .\n\nAbout \"position better\" part, well, I would say it is not the absolute truth, since even 'pray' just dies when he got sandwiched or focused.\nIn addition, we are not talking about pros, since they are way different from the usual.\n\nWell, I'm whining. I admit it.{{sticker:slayer-pantheon-rainbows}}  But still, QSS nerf is ridiculous and should be reversed.","replies":[]},{"poster":"JasonWazza","date":"2016-05-27T09:12:12.014+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Phy whinge video, seems par for course of the rest of his videos.\n\nI like how he is trying to defend the meta we just had with ADC's being in every role.\n\nAnd then even goes to \"The pro's don't need this but plebs do\" which is a terrible argument towards a balance team that actually balance's more towards the Pro's then the plebs.","replies":[]}]}
