Xerath, zyra, lux etc) seems to get aimed down quite easily and bet bursted by the entire enemy team from getting caught out.\r\nShould there be an QSS like item For AP mid laners?","replies":[{"poster":"Keith Espinosa","date":"2016-02-10T13:35:29.435+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It might be a worth while item, though Zonya's is meant to fill the QSS neiche for AP champions.  The thinking (Correct me if i'm wrong) during the item creation was probably along the lines of \"Casters need to have time to bring their cool downs back slightly during combat\", while the persistant DPS of AD champions, which requires no cool downs, merited more of a cleanse type item anyway. \n\nOnce you factor in the crucible existing as a cleanse, you essentially have a self cleanse (To mantain DPS output), a stasis (To enable AP to regain cool downs), and a \"Cleanse your allies\" to give more team play. Add in the near worthless summoner spell, that can't cleanse all CC's and there is not much reason to give AP casters an AP QSS style item, as it would remove most counter play from hyper mobile, low cool down casters (Looking at Kassadin and LB), which zonya's does provide.","replies":[]},{"poster":"CrispyLeaves","date":"2016-02-08T10:40:43.926+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Cleanse","replies":[{"poster":"Keith Espinosa","date":"2016-02-10T13:31:07.379+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"a few CC's render summoner spells inoperable, meaning cleanse is near useless on any champion, especially once you consider QSS and zonya's exist.\\","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Essembie","date":"2016-02-09T03:20:30.246+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Zhonyas fills that function.

Leblanc) let say she was 10/1/0 on the first 20 mins of the game and let say her team is bunch of noob and your Team only got 1 hard CC for Leblanc that can kill her which is WW ult.
