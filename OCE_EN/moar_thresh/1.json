She needs kills to get resets , and since her ult is a channel almost every other champ has something to end it.  Once her ult is down , she is easy to take out.\nExhaust her when she ults. stun, silence , knockback , knockup , fear... zhonyas , blink/flash away.  She may be reasonably difficult to shut down if she gets fed , same as many other hyper-carries , but she has so many weaknesses early-mid game that she only really gets fed if you let her.","replies":[]},{"poster":"SEKAI","date":"2015-09-19T13:21:08.538+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I have only seen Kat in bot game when I played recently.","replies":[]}]}
