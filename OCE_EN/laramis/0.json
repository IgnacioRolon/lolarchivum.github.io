(so using Alfawarrior's example, gold 5 MMR and an ok placement will get you in silver 2, but a plat 5 mmr and an ok placement will get you to gold 2)","replies":[]},{"poster":"Alfawarrior3","date":"2015-11-11T05:36:36.680+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Laramis,realm=OCE,application-id=Ntey9fRZ,discussion-id=wOJIax6E,comment-id=00000000,timestamp=2015-11-11T05:33:16.494+0000)\n>\n> Yea ok, how?

I think that preseason is only so long is so that people can figure out how to play the game after all the new changes that is why what I think would be better is to shorten pre season to maybe end of November so people can figure out how to play the game with all these new changes without having this prolonged period where the games don't really matter","replies":[]},{"poster":"Zaps","date":"2015-11-11T05:49:38.525+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The way that ranked resets at the beginning of the season isn't a hard reset to put everyone at the same value - everyone is reset to a level that is relative to their rating at the start of the season. (This avoids the problem of having really strong players playing weaker players early in the season) This means that the games in the preseason can have an effect on where you start after placements next season.","replies":[]}]}
