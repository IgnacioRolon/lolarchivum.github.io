To Mac users Leave Buster is a god to them. With all the Mac issues in the Mac Client such as Lag, and Ping issues, Launcher unable to open, the bugs and glitches, the patch scanning files crap. Well, let's start off with the lag issues. People who normally open the client which it works, what I first do is enter a bot game to test my connection, turns out i have to wait 3 mins with 0 fps and packet failure. Leave buster ends up making me wait 20 mins in between games. LOL what a Joke. For Mac users to me I find the lag issues really annoying, you lag at the start of the game, engaging, disengaging, when your about to die when you could probably press flash, heal, barrier or some spell to keep you alive, yet you can't cause it can't send a signal through all the lag you get and you die. Also happen when the enemy team engages in on you, you lag. What I mean by Lag is that our screen just freezes for like 20 seconds. Then resumes itself. I've seen someone post something about this on reddit who got around 1K upvotes.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Maxybond Dragon","date":"2014-12-19T09:28:19.152+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"i mean. how am i support to help it. i play maybe 5 games a day. 4 of them are great then randomly get 1 where i disconnect. next thing i know (because this happens every couple of days) i assume getting reported atleast once for each. and i now have to wait.\n\ncause thats fair!","replies":[]},{"poster":"DONGERLORD","date":"2014-12-19T05:17:01.387+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yeah im the same :/ keep dc'ing and this is what happens gotta wait 10 mins to get into Qs kinda annoyed when i cant help it..","replies":[]}]}
