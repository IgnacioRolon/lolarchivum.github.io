Another marketing strategy people are being suckered in to.\n\nFirst: Release a champ who is broken OP beyond belief\n\nSecond: Wait for everyone to buy the champ and their skins because people think \"oh yes Ima get easy wins!\"\n\nThird: Once everyone has bought the champ, and bought skins for it, RIOT says \"oh we're sorry, we had no idea they would be so op when we released them (does anyone believe that crap??) We'll nerf her now.\n\nOne year later: Nerf them to the ground till its so under-powered it forces people to buy a new champ.\nAnd the cycle continues...","replies":[]},{"poster":"ReLaXDeAtHz","date":"2017-05-09T11:52:21.161+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"bro just main bard top its op","replies":[]},{"poster":"Talon12","date":"2017-05-09T10:48:04.700+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"She is broken anyway, no nerfing will shut her down, unless they target that 400% damage aa reset with 50% true damage","replies":[]},{"poster":"Arkangyle","date":"2017-05-09T06:11:43.740+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I had a Camille go 24/0/2 in a game last week.\n\nYeah, she can carry.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Ing√©nue","date":"2017-05-08T23:14:24.189+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"She is still pretty good and he mobility is unparalleled by any other top lane champion.

There is a Diamond player who one-tricks AD Soraka Top. There are Challenger Aatrox one-tricks. Even though Annie may be OP in lower ranks, in Diamond+ everyone knows how to play against her and destroy her with no problem, but that hasn't stopped Annie Bot from reaching Challenger and getting 3 accounts high Diamond+. There was even a thing last year about a player who climbed from Silver to Plat with just Singed (mind you he is Rank 1 Singed, and was banned a few times due to his unorthodox play style). \n\nIt's all about dedicating time to a specific champion.
