Just hit 6300 IP and looking for a new champ to main.\r\nAzir and Aurelion Sol have caught my attention because of their unique playstyles and high skill caps.\r\nHowever, it looks possible they may be reworked soon?! So will learning them be a waste?\r\nThen there is Camille, who looks fun with her wall jump.\r\nSo do I play it safe with Camille, or try Azir/Aurelion (im still stuck deciding which i prefer)?\r\nThank you :)))","replies":[{"poster":"Lord Sesshomaru","date":"2017-05-14T01:51:42.839+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"As an Azir and Aurelion Sol main, I can tell you that they are both extraordinarily fun. Their sustain play styles mean that unlike other mages, you can be useful all throughout the fight. So if you are ahead, you are able to impact the fight as a whole, a lot more than a single target burst champ like Kassadin can.\n\nAurelion Sol's roaming capabilities mean that if you are being destroyed in lane, you can focus on roaming and give your bot lane the advantage. Also you can roam if you are ahead and try to transfer some of year lead to your team.\n\nAzir is the opposite, his roam is far less productive, and he has to spend 3 of his 4 abilities just getting into position when ganking, but he can siege lanes like a madman due to his waveclear and poke, it'd be a rare occasion that the enemy takes your tower before you take theirs. So it is much more productive to stay in lane, farm up and push hard. \n\nBoth however, have mega weaknesses!\nAurelion Sol is countered by all the popular mid laners and junglers, Yasuo/Fizz/Kat/Zed/Lee etc all just jump inside his stars as easy as pie, and once they are inside, you have 2 options, ult or die. It's that simple _(and your ult isn't always up)_. And becasue all these champs are popular, you have to vs them most games, far more often than you would vs someone you can go even with or even counter. So that can make life as Sol very tricky, especially when learning him.\n\nAzir also has his fair share of problems, _(albeit less than Sol)_. His extremely high skillcap and skillfloor means that you have the same impact on the game as any other mage, but for significantly more effort. Cassiopeia can do just about anything he can _(damage wise)_, but with far far far less effort on your behalf.\nYou would have much more impact on the game for far less effort playing someone like Syndra or Yasuo, than you would with Azir.\n\nbut that being said, Azir _(for me at least)_ is much more fun than the others, which is why I play him. And let it not be said that he can't carry games! Oh boy can he carry! but it just takes a lot more effort is all.\n\nI dont play Camille, so I cant really give much insight on her, but she is far more reliable than the two mages. and is also very fun from what Ive heard.\n\n__________\n\nAs for reworks \n\nAurelion Sol is definitely getting one _(according to a Rioter several months back)_, However, he said that they would have something to show us in 4 or 5 patches, and it's been 10 since that statement. So wether that means they scraped it, or it's just taking longer than they thought, I don't know.\n\nAzir. I have never come across any information that he is being reworked, yet people keep telling me that he is, and its scaring me! :S  so I'm worried there is something I don't know. _(if you could give me your source that'd be great!)_\n\nIf either of them are being reworked, I doubt they will be huge reworks, certainly not Galio level ones. \nBut seeming as it took me 20 games just to learn how to not feed as Azir, it would be a blow to the face to learn him and then a few weeks later he is reworked.\n\n\n_______\n\nPersonally I think Azir is the most fun out of the 3 you mentioned.\nAurelion Sol is definitely the best 'experience'. He is smoother to play than Azir, looks the best of all of them, his particles are sexy af, and 30 mins of Neil Kaplan's witty and sassy voice lines always keeps the game interesting!\nCamille is the most reliable of the 3, she fares the best against the current popular champions like Yasuo and Lee Sin, and her balance of mobility-damage-tankiness should always keep her in the meta, where Azir and Sol do fall in and out of favour.\n\n__________\n\nSo if you want to be safe, strong, but still have a fairly high skillcap champ hat can make plays, Camille is definitely your best pick.\n\nIf you want a challenge, Azir all the way!\n\nand if you are looking for the 'experience' Sol would be the winner.","replies":[{"poster":"Doctor Zaius","date":"2017-05-14T06:07:09.092+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thanks for an amazing reply :)\nThey all still sound so great, I'll just have to toss a coin! Leaning toward Camille.... But Azir is more complex.... But Sol is cooler....\nYeah im worried about azir reworks! Hopefully not too much change.
