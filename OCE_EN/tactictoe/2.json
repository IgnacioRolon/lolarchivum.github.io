This is the single most frustrating thing ever conceived of by you dumbasses. This doesn&#039;t make people behave better, this makes people furious that they can&#039;t communicate with the stupid kents on their team. This doesn&#039;t solve anything.

You **dont** need to talk to your team at all, you can ping cooldowns, warnings and intentions easily. \n\n>This doesn't solve anything. Its STUPID and results in MORE toxicity than ever before thought possible.\n\nObviously if you have been chat restricted you need to take a step back and think why you are being such an ♥ ♥ ♥. Do you really have to type in chat flaming your team or the enemy? (Hint: the answer is no) What you really need is to learn to relax and to verbalise your aggression instead of typing it in chat. Typing takes effort away from the game, as well as the fact that a lot of people tilt off of people flaming them, making the game harder instantly. \n\nIf you can't control your aggression and the chat restricts didn't work and make you more toxic, then you get to enjoy the wonders of a 14 day suspension and then a permaban.","replies":[]}]}
