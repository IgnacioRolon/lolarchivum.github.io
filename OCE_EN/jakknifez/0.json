But this time permanently. I Know you would not know this but I do have Aspergers, And I was banned for being &quot;Toxic&quot; Now I will admit I was being &quot;Toxic&quot; But that is because my bot lane was Feeding and being absolute trolls. Which made me very angry.\nSo I lashed out on them with very &quot;Toxic&quot; Things. I would like to speak to someone about getting this dealt with. I have spent heaps of money on league and spent heaps of time. Sometimes I never went outside to play league. BUT now I am banned for being a Idiot. \n\nPlease get someone to come out and speak to me about this Situation, I Am very sad and angry because my teammates were also being &quot;Toxic&quot;\nOnce again please get someone to speak to me about dealing with this. #UNBANJAKKNIFEZ #LOVEYALL\nThank you and goodbye.\n~Jak","replies":[{"poster":"Prowlore","date":"2016-06-01T08:34:04.265+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"If you were toxic, you were toxic. No excuse. \nEven if your teammates were, simply mute and report them after the game ends. If you have a bad temper and decide to trashtalk back without having to, that's your own fault. \nIf your team is so-called \"feeding\" don't point it out and use it as an excuse to your loss all game, encourage them / give tips. I despise immature brats who blame a single person for doing bad early the entire game because of their kda, don't be that guy.\nThat's all, good luck on getting the new account up, never too late to do it.","replies":[{"poster":"JakKnifez","date":"2016-12-14T10:12:02.507+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"lool, I Actually made 2 accounts after this and they all got banned for the same shit. that's 60 bucks or more down the fucking drain. 0-0","replies":[{"poster":"JakKnifez","date":"2016-12-14T10:12:34.604+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"3 PERMAS IN 1 YEAR TYLER1 OCE CONFIRMED. {{champion:119}} {{champion:119}} {{champion:119}} {{champion:119}} {{champion:119}} {{champion:119}} {{champion:119}} {{champion:119}} {{champion:119}} {{champion:119}} {{champion:119}} {{champion:119}} {{champion:119}} {{champion:119}} {{champion:119}} {{champion:119}} {{champion:119}} {{champion:119}} {{champion:119}} {{champion:119}} {{champion:119}} {{champion:119}} {{champion:119}} {{champion:119}} {{champion:119}} {{champion:119}} {{champion:119}} {{champion:119}} {{champion:119}} {{champion:119}} {{champion:119}} {{champion:119}} {{champion:119}} {{champion:119}} {{champion:119}} {{champion:119}} {{champion:119}} {{champion:119}} {{champion:119}} {{champion:119}} {{champion:119}} {{champion:119}} {{champion:119}} {{champion:119}} {{champion:119}} {{champion:119}} {{champion:119}} {{champion:119}} {{champion:119}} {{champion:119}} {{champion:119}} {{champion:119}} {{champion:119}} {{champion:119}} {{champion:119}} {{champion:119}} {{champion:119}} {{champion:119}} {{champion:119}} {{champion:119}} {{champion:119}} {{champion:119}} {{champion:119}} {{champion:119}}","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Gearfighterz","date":"2016-05-31T15:54:23.818+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"lol all i can say is good luck, you were banned for being toxic, you wont get your account back. aspergers is not an excuse.
