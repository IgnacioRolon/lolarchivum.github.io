Whats the reason to watch Worlds if your gonna see one team win every single year? For me, it is seeing other teams improve and climb higher and make achievements, while also giving us *good* gameplay and suprises other people that these teams such as RNG have potential to be World Champion but got *Swepted* by SKT\r\nFor example:\r\nRNG made it to Semis\r\nFnatic made it to Semis\r\n*TSM and G2 still in Group Stage*\r\nSSG winning Worlds is something that i actually enjoyed seeing as they beat the *rusty* king SKT T1 Faker. \r\nIt&#039;s like people usually say in video games\r\n- &#039;People will strive to be the best, but to do that, they must dethrone the king by putting a lot of skill, dedication and honor.\r\nSSG won because of these factors:\r\nSkill because they practice a lot\r\nDedication because Crown wanted to have a rematch and take the title of World Champion\r\nHonor because the crowd and people see what SSG dedication to win World&#039;s\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, SKT lost because of some factors\r\n1- They were kings for too long already, this comes in play because they thought they were the very best and have no more obstacle to overcome.\r\n2- People&#039;s expectations and cheering started to fall as people keep seeing SKT being World Champion\r\n3- SKT wants to become World Champion *again* without much dedication as they just want to maintain their title.  Samsung on the other hand, only became World Champion once and got dethroned, this would push them further to their limits as years pass by and now they have succeeded.\r\n\r\n\r\nLet&#039;s hope to see other team&#039;s make it into Knockout Stage next season&#039;s Worlds 2018 and see if any teams would dethrone the now and new king Samsung Galaxy.\r\n*Rusty Faker*","replies":[{"poster":"Fitzky","date":"2017-11-04T21:50:25.843+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"I Literally said to everyone that SSG was gonna win, no way Riot would let SKT win for the 4th time in a row, they would lose viewers.\nWorlds was rigged.","replies":[{"poster":"JasonWazza","date":"2017-11-05T12:32:39.543+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"If it wasn't 3/0 then maybe i'd agree, but i doubt it since that was the case, it's not like they got to run nearly as long because of the straight 3/0, so there is no real benefit to have rigged it to a 3/0 set of matches.","replies":[{"poster":"CHEESYLEEKS","date":"2017-11-05T13:05:08.921+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"yeah i was ready to stop watching if the skt was winning the 4th game by a stomp.... would have reeked of being scripted.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Garen Player","date":"2017-11-05T02:19:43.108+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"Kings are meant to be dethroned :) there is no such thing as a single king ruling one country or a game","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"WoadKethunt","date":"2017-11-06T02:49:15.745+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"this iteration of skt in comparison to the competition is by far the weakest, bot lane was under performing and huni/peanut were also struggling. things wouldn't have been much better if they had brought untara instead of huni but untara would have been more consistent less carrying but also less feeding","replies":[]},{"poster":"CHEESYLEEKS","date":"2017-11-04T22:36:49.862+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Ssg malzahar skin {{sticker:sg-jinx}} ","replies":[{"poster":"Garen Player","date":"2017-11-05T02:19:02.246+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"{{champion:90}}  Oblivion Awaits!!","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"PurpIe","date":"2017-11-04T23:27:18.578+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"SSG Janna inc :) Oh and faker didn't get to play galio but he played ryze and lost, thus his perfect win rate as ryze at worlds is ruined :/","replies":[{"poster":"Garen Player","date":"2017-11-05T02:18:09.765+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Not sure if people will be able to use SSG Janna due to high ban rate in higher elo :)","replies":[]}]}]}
