It might be variable how much it goes up on based on the game, but it'll never actually decrease after a win.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Sackboy","date":"2015-01-08T12:51:07.201+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=JasonWazza,realm=OCE,application-id=Ntey9fRZ,discussion-id=ABRhMlx8,comment-id=0002000000000000,timestamp=2015-01-08T12:27:08.615+0000)\n>\n> The correct MMR is the one that is on the league servers.\n> \n> The one OP.GG gives is a rough guess given the fact that there is actual algorithms to match us up against one another.\n> \n> Unless Duo's are tainting your MMR constantly, your OP.GG MMR would be half decently accurate (doesn't mean that it's useful for anything)\n\nMMR hasn't shown since Season 2.. lmfao.","replies":[{"poster":"JasonWazza","date":"2015-01-08T13:02:54.106+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"No %%%% sherlock, that doesn't mean it doesn't exist.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"GoldenTomat0","date":"2015-01-08T03:44:46.234+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"how do you know you've lost mmr. op.gg bases mmr off of your opponents, it's not accurate.","replies":[]},{"poster":"JasonWazza","date":"2015-01-08T06:48:01.990+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Fact: Duoing is no longer able to be tracked by OP.GG and if you read, they flat out tell you that duoing will change your MMR artifically and that is why they normally wouldn't count it.\n\nFact is if you duo, your MMR for OP.GG will be even more inaccurate, and not only that it's already obvious from your Game MMR's (they go from 1100 to just below 1300) that you have been duoing.\n\nIf you are duoing in the last 4-5 games OP.GG MMR calculations will be off.","replies":[]}]}
