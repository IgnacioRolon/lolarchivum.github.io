Today my power went out and I went 'afk' there wasn't a storm around so it was unexpected..\r\nnow I'm on another low priority que (for 10min this time) because something happened that was out of my control and I came back and we won the game..\r\n\r\nshould you be put on a low priority que even if you'd re joined the game?\r\n\r\nIt's one thing to leave the game intentionally but another to have something out of your control happen, then get punished for it","replies":[{"poster":"Strat","date":"2015-01-17T15:26:12.618+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Don't play with an unstable connection.

It's just a selfish act to continue playing with the chance of completely ruining games.\n\nWhen I had an unstable connection I had to quit League for 3 months until it was sorted out.

If you can determine which days it might happen the I'm sure you could find something else to do on those days until the issue has been resolved but it wouldn't be too easy to figure out when it'll happen. I suggest keeping track of your disconnections and seeing if you can find some kind of pattern. Also, is there anything else using the internet when the disconnections happen? Might be related to the problem.","replies":[{"poster":"22 5 19 20 1","date":"2015-01-18T05:26:42.426+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I have..

There's no way for Riot or the leavebuster system to identify who's left a game intentionally and who's disconnected due to something out of their control and, even if they had something to detect that, it would be abuseable as people could just switch off their modems and avoid punishment. Unfortunately, because of the actions of some individuals, others who've done nothing wrong are at risk of punishment but I don't see a way to avoid that while still effectively punishing those who deserve it.","replies":[]}]}
