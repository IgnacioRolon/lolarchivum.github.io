Asking people to do basic computer maintenance is not the realm of the so called \"hardcore elite\".

If there's a bad storm, do something else. And just because there are casual players doesn't make this a casual game. This is neither a casual nor an elite game. It's just a game. Neither of you have any access to Riot's statistics, so you have no idea how many people are casual, hardcore or anywhere in between. Why are people so eager to label games?\n\nAs for your statistics, keep them to yourself. Unless you have an actual source, statistics are useless. How do you know anything about the power of the average users PC? With the advances in computers over the last few years, and the rapid hardware development time, I could build a gaming PC for $500 that could easily run League of Legends, and if you keep your system healthy, you won't have any boot or crash issues.

If you have a dodgy connection you shouldn't play ranked, that's fair because that is affecting others, but you shoudknt be forbidden from playing normals, which is kinda what leaverbuster does atm, one of my friends has quit completely because he lives on a farm with bad ping and DC's for 10 min every 5 games or so, he never played ranked but he spent around $100 on skins because he liked the game, but leaverbuster has given him ridiculous q times and he has just given up, I guess that's why I feel strongly about it,\n\nAnyway all the points you have made are pretty strong and i appreciate your equality and objectifying the situation not being attached to it and swearing ect \n\nI agree with what you say and will not use my own predictions as statistics again :)","replies":[{"poster":"HORSE OF FORCE","date":"2015-01-11T09:35:20.841+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":">All my entire argument is saying is: lol should be a game that all can enjoy\n\nIf everyone thought like this, it would be a much better game.","replies":[{"poster":"HORSE OF FORCE","date":"2015-01-11T11:11:01.333+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hell, that would make for a better *world*.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Lord Sesshomaru","date":"2015-01-11T09:57:58.965+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yea it sure would, if we could all be tolerant it would be great","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Dowie92","date":"2015-01-11T13:16:04.209+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Wow.
