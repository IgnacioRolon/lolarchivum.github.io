So now i found the mistake in my password and changed it back. the only way my accout of change it password is the riot employee who has read my ticket. i cant recover my password becuase i have change my email yet to my current one. i don&#039;t the the unverified password anymore. then all this shit happen and screwed me all over. can one of Riot member please help me out fast as possible no able to play is bs. im still logged into oce.leagueoflegends.com and that is how i can wright this post now.\r\nThank you \r\nI&#039;m posting it on here becuase the help and support section is getting spammed with poker adds.","replies":[{"poster":"Gehirn","date":"2016-11-07T00:52:29.467+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":0,"body":"I don't believe that you're the owner of this account.
