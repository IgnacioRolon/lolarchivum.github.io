She even has the power to move gigantic stars or even destroy them completely if she sees fit to do so in order for the galaxy to function properly. Rinnly definitely shows that you do not have to look big and mighty to be a very powerful being.\n\n****\n\nRinnly&#039;s unique trait is being an ability power duo-lane mage, replacing the typical marksman role completely.\n\n****\n\n> **Basic Attack Range:** 600 units\n> **Movement:** 335 units per second\n> **Base Attack Speed:** 0.675 attacks per second +3.5% bonus attack speed per level\n> \n> ****\n> \n> **Celestial Bond (Passive):** Range: 1200 units\n> Rinnly gains 20% increased ability power when near at least one ally champion.\n> \n> Rinnly&#039;s basic attacks restore 8(+20%AP) health on-hit over 2 seconds, 25% as effective against minions.\n> \n> **Infinite Power (Q):** Cooldown: 1 second; Cost: 25 Mana; Range: 975 units\n> Rinnly blasts a star shard in the target direction to deal 25/30/35/40/45(+20%AP) magic damage to the first enemy struck and applying a star multiplier for the next 3 seconds multiplying the damage of the next Infinite Power based on the multiplier number on the target.\n> \n> Every Infinite Power on the same enemy refreshes the star multiplier duration and adds +1 to the multiplier number.\n> \n> **Solar Beam (W):** Cooldown: 11 seconds; Cost: 80/85/90/95/100 Mana; Range: 1200 units\n> Rinnly charges up for 1 second and then unleashes a powerful beam in the target direction stopping at and stunning the first enemy champion struck for 1.75/2/2.25/2.5/2.75 seconds.\n> \n> Solar Beam deals 100/140/180/220/260(+65%AP) magic damage to any minions and monsters in the beam&#039;s path.\n> \n> **Universal Balance (E):** Cooldown: 7 seconds; Cost: 65 Mana; Range; 725 units\n> Rinnly targets a friendly or enemy champion and surrounds it with mini stars for the next 2.5 seconds allowing her basic abilities to be cast from that target as well.\n> \n> If the target has a higher percentage of health than Rinnly then she gains a shield equal to 60/90/120/150/180(+75%AP) for 2.5 seconds.\n> If the target has a lower percentage of health than Rinnly then she speeds up an ally champion or slows down an enemy champion by 40/50/60/70/80% for 2.5 seconds.\n> \n> **Galactic Control (R):** Cooldown: 150/135/120 seconds; Cost: 100 Mana; Range: 900 units / 350/425/500 units\n> Rinnly can use her power to pick up either an ally or enemy champion allowing her next movement command to quickly throw that target to that location a short distance away and stunning an enemy champion for 1 second while ally champions become invulnerable for 1 second.
