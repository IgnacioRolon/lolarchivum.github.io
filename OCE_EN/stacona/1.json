Typically in the past the only way to accomplish this is as support, but what if Zyra has a support to help keep champions within her plants and she gets the farm? Most of Zyra&#039;s damage is output by her plants, which is a sustain damage source and quite a bit of damage at that, so she can take down tanks that way and with her slightly longer range basic attacks she is able to help siege turrets on top of ability power being buffed up against structures.\r\n\r\n****\r\n\r\nTry to summarize this up:\r\nBasically for the mid-season update it would be cool to make Zyra as a duo-lane mage replacing the role of what a marksman would have fulfilled entirely, since Zyra has the tools already she can get small smaller buffs both directly and indirectly to help her take objectives and survive against marksmen.\r\n\r\n****\r\n\r\nThe marksmen survival would be adding essentially another Doran item where it would be more expensive than a Doran&#039;s Ring but you gain something like 5% spell vamp (it would be 450g same as Doran&#039;s Blade), since a marksman would have Doran&#039;s Blade&#039;s lifesteal granting an item with a little bit of spell vamp can allow healing from dealing damage; an example stats would be something like +15 Ability Power, +70 Health, +50% base Mana Regen, +5% Spell Vamp @450g [Doran&#039;s Ring being cheaper and grants some mana refund on executes].\r\n\r\nDirect buffs would be something like a higher base attack speed and more attack speed per level to help with killing structures, effecting her objective taking against structures only and nothing notice-able when fighting monsters like Dragon/Baron Nashor and champions.\r\n\r\nSo for the most part its about adding a new Doran item for AP champions that has some health sustain and less mana sustain.\r\n\r\n****\r\n\r\nI think it would be cool seeing ranged mages instead of marksmen in the duo-lane, and there are others that could replace marksmen too, but since Zyra is there already we can just give some small changes and add a new starting item and we have a new farm orientated champion in the duo-lane without forcing things like a melee mage with a majour gimmick called sly-foo the ghost dragon.\r\n\r\nAlso I am not forcing a champion to be played anywhere if you want Zyra to be a mid or support then she can be played there, this is just adding another option that can also change up the meta drastically rather than seeing marksmen 100% of the time in the farm slot in the duo-lane. Do not forget Kennen can be played top, mid, support, and as a marksman and still be considered balanced; while Kog&#039;Maw can be a mage in the mid lane or a marksman in the duo lane.\r\n\r\n****\r\n\r\nHope you you enjoyed the insight AND opening the realms of new possibilities! (We do not have to copy the Koreans people, we can be the first to new things and get a head start of the filthy Koreans and actually win something for once.)","replies":[{"poster":"ElysiumManifests","date":"2016-04-08T10:17:17.650+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"She getting a rework in the Mid Year Mage Update","replies":[]},{"poster":"profflippynips","date":"2016-04-07T01:36:32.343+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I like this idea of pulling Zyra out of meta. I've only just recently started player her (thanks to free rotation) and I find her play style exciting, though not easy. She has the ability to put down a lot of damage, but it is very zone reliant. If you're against a carry like Graves or Lucian, you may struggle to get the damage you need as they can dash out of your damage zone. But, when you catch someone, oh the pain.\n\nPlaying her bot lane as a carry is a great idea and would work pretty well with aggressive CC supports who can catch opponents in her damage zone. But, it also depends on team comp and if you have another source of AD damage.\n\nGive it a try and see how you go. I'm sure you'll catch a few people by surprise.","replies":[]}]}
