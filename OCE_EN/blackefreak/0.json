These are no tolerance language (hate speech, suicide encouragement, etc.) and gameplay toxicity (feeding, griefing, etc.).\n\nYour reform card will shed light on which of these behaviours specifically you were punished for.\n\nIf you feel a punishment has been made in error, you can appeal it via player support: https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/requests/new\n\nIf you want community feedback on a punishment, then you can post your reform card (the popup telling you are banned when you log into the game).","replies":[]}]}
