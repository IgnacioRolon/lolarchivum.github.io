There should be a map rotation with The Proving grounds, Howling Abyss and Butcher&#039;s bridge. They should also do that with the summoner&#039;s rift music (I know you can change from classic to standard). Like add the bilgewater music into it too.\r\n\r\nThis is just my opinion though. If you disagree with this, that is completely fine.\r\n\r\n{{champion:432}} MASTER RACE!","replies":[]}
