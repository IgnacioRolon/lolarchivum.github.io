That item is one of the most important items for champs like annie, ahri, fizz, etc. and removing it will make these type of champs weaker and will be forced to adapt to a new build. Nerfing it is all good like make the damage less but completely removing it ruins not only these champs but possibly the game because people have fun with this item and even uses it on champs who don't even need it. Once DFG is removed, there will be some popular champs (Ahri, Annie, etc.) that will become underrated and less popular and the champs that are unpopular and underrated (Syndra, Viktor, etc.) will just be so weak that no one will play these champs.\r\n\r\nThis might not be a strong arguement but DFG must not be removed riot. \r\nAlso if a rioter copy and paste's the same god damn reason about removing it, I will start complaints because I already read 4 discussions with a rioter posting the same reason! Those 2 reasons alone won't stop the fact that I will continue complaining. Also I thought riot listens to the league of legends community. Because if you do, THEN DON'T REMOVE DFG!","replies":[{"poster":"Lord Kylar Alice","date":"2015-01-25T07:49:13.458+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"Ahri's getting some buffs and Annie and Fizz won't get hit too hard by it.","replies":[]},{"poster":"DatEpicPotato","date":"2015-01-25T23:46:34.348+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The point of removing DFG is to NERF the champions, because fizz, ahri and syndra are totally balance when they can one shot you in an instant, anytime they want. They nerfed talon's silence so now a fast zhonya's immediately removes all threats from him, but champs like fizz and syndra can simply stay back and wait.\n\nWithout DFG, the champions will be more like the way they were intended to be (ahri being a kite Mage, syndra being a back liner punishing enemies that misstep, and fizz being a mobile champ diving in and out of fights)\n\nAs for the not-so-op champs that need DFG, I am a viktor main and have been one for over a year, and throughout this time, I have not built DFG ONCE yet still manage to get great scores and an amazing win loss ratio. Champs like ahri will be getting some buffs to compensate for the DFG, but will now be centered more towards her intended playstyle.\n\nYou have to think of it from riot's point of view, just because you might like playing DFG fizz and bursting people down without counter play doesn't mean it's healthy for the game.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Kappacchino","date":"2015-01-25T09:37:57.957+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"{{champion:112}} {{champion:134}}  are not under rated or unpopular","replies":[]}]}
