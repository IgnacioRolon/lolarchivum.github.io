I was thinking 'wtf'. The picture of it was a question mark on it. It's probably a bug but i saw the actual name \"Zeratul\". If this is a new champion thats pretty awesome but I honestly doubt that. Did anyone else experience this? Or is it just me?","replies":[{"poster":"Urgot Bot","date":"2015-01-11T12:06:43.347+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Screenshot?","replies":[]},{"poster":"Deadspec","date":"2015-01-12T11:30:55.940+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"m8 you were playing star craft and that's why it also said wood 5","replies":[]},{"poster":"Niji","date":"2015-01-11T13:57:04.376+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"MY LIFE FOR AIUR!","replies":[]}]}
