The jungler shouldn't gank them, but they also shouldn't get pissed like a majority do and take \"can I get a gank\" as blaming them that their lane is fed.\n\nAnd if people still blame the jungler that they don't win their lane, sometimes it actually is the junglers fault. Obviously not in bronze-gold ELO, but if a mid laner is in a really important lane matchup that decides the game, or at least teamfights, the jungler's priority should be that. However, if the jungler doesn't gank and mid feeds the lane, it is not the jungler's fault. It is mids. I guess what I am trying to say is that even if they should've ganked and it is their fault for that, the mid could've not fed in the exact same manner.\n\nUnless we are talking about Viktor or Le'Blanc. If they get first blood I don't think you can blame anyone.","replies":[{"poster":"JasonWazza","date":"2016-07-11T05:34:36.537+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Viktor i can understand as you can't really blame anyone, but Le'Blanc? really?\n\nIt's not all that hard to play around a Le'Blanc.","replies":[{"poster":"DipperOCE","date":"2016-07-11T07:04:17.359+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Every time I talk about a champion like that everyone thinks I am saying they are OP these days.
