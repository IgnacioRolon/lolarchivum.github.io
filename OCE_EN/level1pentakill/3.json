I understand them doing their Job is having a 1K Damage burst rotation, but that really doesn&#039;t scale off late game. They don&#039;t really need much to turn team fights. Put two of these on one team, A Trundle and a Thresh and you will have issues all game.\r\n\r\nBlade of the Ruined King is trash Tier. Liandry&#039;s is just as Trash.\r\n\r\nPick 2 tanks? Congratulations, you are now absolutely sh-t Champions but if everyone doesn&#039;t put in 100% and know the game on many levels, you can just run in and 1v3 for 30 seconds then walk away - trade won. I understand the concept of dealing with bonus stat stacking teams, team compositions and %DMG against HP Stackers, counter-stats and how fights end up translating from the Champions present and stat shredding etc; but this whole pick a few tanks thing is the most annoying crap in the game. They slow it down, they&#039;re boring as F. Most of them are easy mode and you gave us 0 options once in game to focus them (Why?) (It&#039;s called a 4 person frontline that DOES DAMAGE).
