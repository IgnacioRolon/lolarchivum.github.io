I mean he&#039;s killable - but that&#039;s not the point, his sustain is a bit ridiculous situationally.\r\n\r\nAs for Ryze oh God the values at level 4 are ridiculous. He has too much MS for what his kit is designed to do, so his damage/safety tradeoff is basically non-existent.","replies":[{"poster":"Knuuckles","date":"2016-07-14T10:07:29.306+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I think ryze is probably in his most balanced state since the start of league, you can't just head butt the keyboard you actually have to use your combo accordingly to a certain situation","replies":[]},{"poster":"DipperOCE","date":"2016-07-14T03:50:59.642+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Well that's the thing, he has a very strong early game, yes, but he doesn't snowball crazily, and can't fall behind crazily. To make up for his very strong in lane trading, he had very limited range. Stay in a minion wave and trade if he gets too close if you are top lane, that is how it is for every champion that you don't counter. If you are mid lane, most champions actually out range him, even Katarina's Q has more range than his W and E, and if you just fire that off then sidestep you can poke for free.\n\nSame with Xerath, Lux, Lissandra, etc. Top lane against Ryze is a little more challenging, but it is way more bearable than a long range mage, or Veigar, or anyone with burst and range.\n\nYou are lucky he doesn't have a stun. Right now he is sitting around or slightly above a 50% win rate, and we can assume that most of the 30% factors come from new players to him, whilst the 51-52% win rates are an average of the really good Ryze players and the decent Ryze players.\n\nEven though I defend him and main him, I have played against Ryze many many times as other champions, and it actually takes no challenge to lane against him. Veigar is a really big counter, so is Xerath and Lux. In the top lane, Garen turned out to counter him in straight out fights, (not poke).\n\nIt's really just the play style that people need to adjust to. Whenever a new champion or rework gets released, even if it isn't OP, people just say it is OP in the first day because they haven't had a chance to play against it, learn it's counters, etc.\n\nJust give it a week and a bit, the people trying him out will be gone, you won't see as many, and when you do, the laning phase / early game roaming is his best strength.","replies":[]}]}
