I mean its a bit easy for him and his sustain is pretty huge for such a bursty and slippery Assassin.\r\n\r\nPlus on top of this he can get away with farming in almost complete safety, hurt counter-junglers badly (Even the Tanky ones like Shyvana who versing an Assassin like this shouldn&#039;t be so dearly wounded and even tank Junglers feel the pain (Malphite/Sejuani) although they fare better, his Kit just makes him a monster compared to these picks who should in reality be strong against him and dealing with him as another Assassin or even someone like Xin Zhao can be a far stretch.\r\n\r\nHe shouldnt be able to farm all game and come out strong, he should have to make plays and he shouldnt be snowballing off these plays quite as hard as he is.","replies":[{"poster":"Soulless Reaper","date":"2016-07-14T09:59:08.223+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Are they nerfing Darius?

Losing half my HP from half the lane away is cancerous. Let's not forget the fact that if he throws three soldiers at you, you're gonna have to flash or get killed in half a second. Oh, and his disabling ult, which does so much damage and splits apart teams. Let's just make that ult deal 80% of the ADCs HP and stop them from going anywhere.\n\nAzir is a disgusting champ who needs to be gutted, then we can gut Kha'Zix, the bronze stomper.","replies":[{"poster":"CHEESYLEEKS","date":"2016-07-13T15:10:42.389+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"while were at it can we gut annie.","replies":[{"poster":"4fy9bEOt7y","date":"2016-07-14T01:34:08.927+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=CHEESYLEEKS,realm=OCE,application-id=Ntey9fRZ,discussion-id=NasuEsu8,comment-id=00000001,timestamp=2016-07-13T15:10:42.389+0000)\n>\n> while were at it can we gut annie.\n\nHow about I gut you?","replies":[{"poster":"CHEESYLEEKS","date":"2016-07-14T05:42:39.340+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"{{sticker:zombie-nunu-tears}}","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"DiamondAries","date":"2016-07-13T13:11:15.371+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"neither of them need nerfs imo\n\nKha will always outduel everyone because of isolation, nuff said\n\nAzir is a control mage, jumping on his face with an assassin will screw him over.
