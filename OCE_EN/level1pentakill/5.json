I mean he technically already is a jellyfish but maybe he could have a water spout as his ultimate or it could be a bit of a darker theme and be him inking people although that&#039;s a bit dirty.\r\n\r\nMilitary Jinx: Same as regular Jinx but with maybe more realistic weaponry (Common to current weaponry, just more grungy looking weapons) and maybe a helmet. I mean there&#039;s officer Vi so there could be renegade or Military Jinx. I mean there&#039;s nothing scarier than someone dressed as military who isn&#039;t actually military.\r\n\r\nPool Party Gnar: Same as regular Gnar except he throws Frisbees. I don&#039;t know about his ultimate, but he could just have water effects. I&#039;m not good at ideas when it comes to fitting a giant Mammoth monster thing into a pool party outfit.\r\n\r\nPool Party Gragas. I&#039;m not sure if this is already a thing, but he could just be wearing speedos and have like his whole body censored.\r\n\r\nDark Arts Morgana. I&#039;m not sure it&#039;s ok to put pentagrams into the game, but Morgana is a very visually aesthetic Champion and I think there is a lot of potential for things like infernal/dark magic/light magic type designs or even Pool Party Morgana. She&#039;d make a good Jellyfish.\r\n\r\nSweetheart Darius: Hits you with love and respect. Brings down the hammer on social injustices. Debuffs you with lovehearts that causes your heart to bleed for him.\r\n\r\nTriple Darius/Darius Cena. Hits people with chairs. Not much more to it. Could make Draven in on it, but Primetime Draven and Darius Cena/Triple Darius could be a cool team with the new Wrestling Champion Skins.\r\n\r\nParadise Trundle: Looks less ugly because of some magical idea where he&#039;s not as Ugly.\r\n\r\nStories of the Past Zed: Shadow themed Skin that goes with a vengeful set for the Ionians like Irelia/Akali/Kennen. Basically a black/silver reflective skin design for Zed coupled with... Well I don&#039;t know. I just think thematic to character relationship skins could be an awesome addition as there&#039;s already sort of a few I think and a lot of the skins fit the Character but sets relative to Runeterran relations would be sick.\r\n\r\nI had one more idea. I think it was: Statue of Teemo or Kangaroo Suit Teemo. Just so he looks like a little statue when he&#039;s standing still in the middle of the lane. Also his death animation can be him crumbling. R.I.P Teemo.
