Dragon Souls don't offer the same moment-to-moment strength as Baron or Elder buff, but they're permanent and an additional bonus on top of the drake stacks their bearers already earned.","url":"https://oce.leagueoflegends.com/en/news/game-updates/patch/patch-923-notes","image":"https://am-a.akamaihd.net/image?f=https://news-a.akamaihd.net/public/images/articles/2019/november/pn23/Victorious_Aatrox_Splash.jpg?v=2"},"up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"This hit support real hard this patch,is kinda a down side to us support main like {{champion:350}}.\r\n\r\nWhen you have the elders dragon execute in {{champion:203}}  **R** is really messed up, as for her **R** clearly says keeps allys alive, better yet you elder dragons is now kinda overpowered! But that is my way of seeing it.\r\n\r\n{{sticker:sg-ahri-2}} \r\n\r\nYes I know I said the same word on the new patch (9.23) at the link above, but I just want to rant a little bigger here, think about all the odd supports used like Yuumi {{champion:350}}? Or {{champion:16}}, I would say Sona {{champion:37}} but she can cover her self fine!\r\n\r\n{{sticker:sg-ezreal}} \r\n\r\nKINDRED! Why did you ruin Kindred's **R** {{champion:203}} she would be a great champ to out-count the EDS (elder dragons) execute, yet you make her **R** not able to do anything?! It's not okay at all for this time being!\r\n\r\n{{sticker:sg-ahri-3}} \r\n\r\n\r\nThank you for your time.\r\n(SORRY THIS IS UNDER PLAYER BEHAVIOR!)","replies":[{"poster":"Ooftman","date":"2019-11-21T05:09:29.958+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"reading this gave me aids","replies":[{"poster":"BlueRaptor24","date":"2019-11-21T11:09:36.834+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'm so sorry lol","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Broken Scripts","date":"2019-11-22T01:48:30.436+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"1.
