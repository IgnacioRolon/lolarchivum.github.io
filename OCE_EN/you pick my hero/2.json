I placed a ward in Dragon spawn and the icon did not go away. \r\nI took this screenshot about 40sec after I placed the ward. Could you fix this issue please\r\n\r\nThanks\r\nAndyTheEskimo","replies":[{"poster":"Er√∏se","date":"2015-11-14T07:48:55.831+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Dragon could have been pulled out so steal potential is lower.","replies":[{"poster":"You Pick My Hero","date":"2015-11-16T03:07:02.597+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"My ward was placed so you would see that. You would see attacks or something. It was a bug as I was certain they took drag only 1min or so ago.

And...the game files are the same on all servers, it's only language files that are different unless there is a special server specific event going on. Something like this, if you're seeing it on OCE, it's on NA too, and LAS, and EUNE etc etc....","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2015-11-14T22:41:52.623+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Assuming it wasn't dragged out, best to post this here: http://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/bug-report\n\nThey made a whole section for bug reports, someone who can fix it/pass it on to the right people is far more likely to see it there.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Zorphiax","date":"2015-11-14T04:31:48.535+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Dragon potentially could of been dragged out of the dragon pit?","replies":[]}]}
