League is an ever changing game, and the methods Riot have employed in executing it are... well they could have done better.\n\nSome things you can try before that, though, are things such as defragmenting your hard-drive, scanning for malicious software, updating all softwares and drivers, running in permanent admin mode or upgrading your computer, if you're willing.\n\nBest of luck.","replies":[]}]}
