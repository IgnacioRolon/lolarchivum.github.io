Why not bring back those Poros from Snowdown {{summoner:30}}? For those that bought the icon like myself, I&#039;d like to make more use of it, and this seem like the perfect chance to do so. The addition of changing it to a Poro will not affect gameplay, and will allow players to show their Poro to the world! It also fits the brief of Howling Abyss, and who doesn&#039;t love Poros :3. So why not share some poro love and BRING THEM BACK. Let us players have fun throwing poros around!","replies":[{"poster":"Lord Sesshomaru","date":"2015-05-05T09:46:01.869+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"i had the same thought, I'm very keen for this!","replies":[]},{"poster":"Talon12","date":"2015-05-05T09:32:11.129+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I do miss Lord Gregory III","replies":[]}]}
