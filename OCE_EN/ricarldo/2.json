Or maybe Road Warrior Rammus\r\nSince I suck at art I&#039;m not even going to attempt to create anything visual so just try to imagine what I&#039;m describing pl0x\r\n\r\n**Basic information**\r\nThis skin is in close reference to the mad max franchise, since Rammus and Max share similar dialogue (Just a few grunts and one word sentences here and there). This skin is in theme with Road Warrior Miss Fortune which is another skin reference to Mad Max\r\n\r\n**Visual Changes**\r\nRammus would be wearing small black leather jacket\r\nHis shell would be black and the spikes would be a bit bloody and have piercings\r\n\r\n**Ability Changes**\r\n\r\nQ- Upon activation, Rammus suddenly appears in a small car (similar to Maxes V8 Interceptor) and instead of rolling around like he usually would, instead he drives in his little car\r\nW- No change\r\nE- No change\r\nR- I spent way longer thinking about this than I should of and I couldn&#039;t come up with anything. If anyone thinks of something please let me know!\r\n\r\n**Other Changes**\r\n\r\nJoke: Well the regular Rammus doesn&#039;t even have a joke and I couldn&#039;t think of anything to use without breaking Rammus&#039; or Maxes general silence \r\n\r\nTaunt: The taunt for the regular Rammus is that he just puts both of his hands up in the air and then puts them back down and once again I couldn&#039;t think of anything for this one\r\n\r\nDance: Rammus pulls out a double necked flamethrower guitar and starts wailing away on it, in reference to that guy from Fury Road who spends the whole movie playing his guitar\r\n\r\nLaugh: No change\r\n\r\nBacking animation: Again I couldn&#039;t really think of much here :/\r\n\r\n\r\nSo it appears that I haven&#039;t really thought about this too much. But hey that just gives the community the chance to help me design this skin. Tell me what you think about the idea, any changes you think could be made and stuff like that!\r\n\r\nAlso criticism is fine as long as it&#039;s constructive. Don&#039;t just say something like &quot;It&#039;s bad&quot; and don&#039;t tell me why.\r\nAnyway thanks guys!","replies":[]}
