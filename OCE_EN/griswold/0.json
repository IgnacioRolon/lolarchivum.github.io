The dark silhouettes of the towers and spires that littered the landscape stood in stark contrast with the waves of orange and purple hues of the sky. Below the silent behemoth of the city, throngs of pedestrians flowed through the streets, impromptu market stalls propped up in large numbers around the perimeter. Lanterns strung above provided a warm glow to the trading and festivities. The uplifting hum of pleasant music echoed faintly throughout the streets.\r\n\r\n_&lsquo;The buffoon on drums is off-beat&rsquo;_, Khada Jhin mused to himself. He himself was tapping his own beat with his index finger against the trigger guard. _&lsquo;1, 2, 3, 4, 1, 2, 3, 4. See? It really isn&rsquo;t difficult.&rsquo;_\r\nJhin sat on the balcony of a tower, knelt over the parapet, observing the scene through his scope. From his position he could see all the way down the wide main street, with the city square awash with activity at the end. He&rsquo;d had his own lanterns strung from one end to another in preparation. White lanterns every 4 yards, red lanterns every 16. He gazed across a band of travelling merchants amongst the stalls, then to the stage situated within the square. People were slowly crowding it as officials began to approach the centre. A speech was about to begin. Within moments the message spread through the masses as they began to converge upon the stage. Even the merchants had disappeared in the fray.\r\n\r\n_&lsquo;Showtime.&rsquo;_\r\n\r\nAn unseen smile grew behind the leather and porcelain that masked his face. Only his visible eye, slightly creased\tin the corners, belied any satisfaction.\r\n_&lsquo;I have crafted many a delicate performance, but this? This is beauty. I truly have outdone myself, so much so that I wonder, could I ever produce as fine a piece again?&rsquo;_  He trained his sights upon the speaker at the podium, taking mental shots and envisioning the path of the bullet, using his lanterns to gauge the distance. If he took the shot now, the bullet would rip through his right eye, yet he left his finger on the trigger guard. Patience was key.\r\n\r\nAt that point, Jhin heard the door to the roof behind him creak the slightest amount and whirled around with rifle in hand, aiming squarely at two merchants who had just entered the room, the door now wide open. Jhin could see their faces now, and was delighted at the spectacle. Zed and Shen both stood unblinking. Zed&rsquo;s eyes were wide and alert with fury, yet beneath them ravines of fatigue wrinkled his eyelids. Shen, for the most part, held his usual stone-plate face but with a hint of something else. \r\n_&lsquo;Is it hatred? Disgust? Yes, definitely disgust.&rsquo;_\r\n\r\n&ldquo;44 traps,&rdquo; Jhin stated. &ldquo;I set 44 traps within this establishment. How many do you think you&rsquo;ve bypassed thus far?&rdquo;\r\nShen slowly stepped forward.\r\n&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been counting. 3 at the entrance, 11 in the hall, 14 in the main room and 16 on the stairway,&rdquo; Shen said with a cold tone, taking another step. Jhin shook his head with a small laugh.\r\n&ldquo;You are just as observant as I thought you&rsquo;d be.&rdquo;\r\n\r\n\r\nShen took his third step forward, nearly in range for a lethal strike, when the stone tile he had stood on sunk, a clockwork ticking noise now echoing throughout the room.\r\n&ldquo;One of the traps on the stairs was a dud,&rdquo; Quipped Jhin smugly. He quickly spun behind a pillar as the explosion rocketed blades across the room. Zed and Shen darted to avoid the shrapnel, but Jhin was immediately throwing a grenade out from behind cover. It arced lazily towards them and time seemed to slow as it fell to the ground. The moment it the cylinder collided with the floor it exploded violently, propelling the grenade to the ceiling where it exploded again. It shot around the room decimating the masonry and kicking up dust. Zed and Shen dodged the blasts as best they could, but were caught by chunks of falling debris and disoriented by the noise and smoke. Jhin quickly dismantled his rifle in the chaos.\r\n\r\nA sharp crack ripped though the air and a portion of wall to the side of Zed&rsquo;s head was destroyed, the dust parting and billowing from the force. Jhin burst through fog before parts of the wall had even touched the ground, slamming his elbow into Zed&rsquo;s sternum. As he was recoiling from the blow, He twisted Zed&rsquo;s arm out and spun him around, placing him between himself and Shen who had just drawn his swords. Jhin cocked his handgun across the back of Zed&rsquo;s neck.\r\n\r\n&ldquo;2!&rdquo; he shouted as he squeezed the trigger. Shen, focussing hard, deflected the shot, sending it cracking against the wall behind him. The sword in his left hand was badly deformed, so he dropped it and charged. Shen stabbed at Jhin&rsquo;s arm, forcing him to withdraw it and release Zed. Zed immediately retaliated by elbowing Jhin in the ribs, then spinning and throwing a series of chops and elbows. Shen thrusted in-between Zed&rsquo;s strikes, aiming at Jhin&rsquo;s heart, but he dipped, weaved and blocked through it all with perfect timing, like an elegant dance.  Shen lunged once more but Jhin twisted out of the way, wrapped Zed&rsquo;s arms around both the blade and Shen&rsquo;s wrist, then ripped it from his grip in one swift motion. \r\n\r\nHe instantly leapt back to create distance, aiming as he hopped from foot to foot. He fired once more, catching Zed in the thigh as he tried to dodge. Before the smoke had even left the gun barrel, Jhin had turned and sprung from the parapet. Shen ran to follow, and witnessed the psychopath landing on the neighbouring rooftop with the grace of a gazelle, not losing any speed as he continued. Shen shot across the gap, his footsteps barely audible over the music. He quickly scanned around as he pursued, noticing that Zed had not followed him. Shen stopped. Jhin was not running anymore. He was kneeling with a rifle in his hands, aiming directly at Shen.\r\n\r\nThough only his eye was showing, his madness and bloodlust was overwhelmingly clear.\r\n&ldquo;The lanterns, the target, the traps, ALL of it a charade to bring the two of you into the spotlight. This is YOUR show! YOUR FINALE!&rdquo; Jhin cackled maniacally. His shadow stood pale and distorted against rooftop. It began to darken, to morph and grow. Zed stepped out from behind Jhin with his blades drawn. He raised his arm, aiming at Jhin&rsquo;s neck. He was laughing too much to hear him.\r\nShen screamed.\r\n&ldquo;Zed, no!&rdquo;\r\n\r\nIn that instant, Jhin turned his head, Zed brought down his blade and Shen dashed forward. Before the blade could connect, Shen stopped him, grabbing his arm.\r\n&ldquo;We&rsquo;re supposed to take him alive!&rdquo; He argued. Zed&rsquo;s face contorted with rage.\r\n&ldquo;Why should we spare him? He is a monster! You have seen the atrocities he has committed just like I have!&rdquo; Zed&rsquo;s tone lowered, no longer shouting. &ldquo;Your Father&rsquo;s mercy is the reason he is still alive. Are you going to make the same mistake?&rdquo; Shen&rsquo;s gaze did not waver, but he did not answer either. \r\n\r\nJhin paused for a moment to realise what had happened, and burst out into uncontrollable laughter. A quiet ticking was masked by his display. He suddenly threw himself off the side of the building as several traps exploded. The sharpened blades cut through the air with a whistle, hitting Shen in the hip and Zed in the shoulder. Jhin landed on a roof below, and proceeded to hop from landing to landing towards the ground where he could disappear into the streets, dull yet insane laughter slowly drowned out by the sounds of the band and the chatter of the crowds. \r\n\r\nShen scrambled to the edge to track him, but he was gone, melted into the crowds. Zed stood with a groan.\r\n&ldquo;You are a fool, Shen! You are weak just like your father! Your order will crumble because of it!&rdquo;\r\nShen stood in silence, watching the people walking through the streets like blood flowing through veins. His icy gaze did not drop for a moment, not even as Zed faded away into the shadows. \r\n_&lsquo;He will have more planned for us.&rsquo;_ He thought to himself. Memories of gory remains haunted him still. He shuddered at the thought and began to leave.","replies":[{"poster":"Oneechan","date":"2016-07-10T12:35:44.348+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Great build-up and you deliver with a powerful finish. This really fleshes out the lore and is still original enough to stand on its own.
