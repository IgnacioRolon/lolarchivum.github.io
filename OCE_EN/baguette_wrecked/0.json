Plat 3 here from Curtin University. It's good to see you being proactive and attempting to rally the troops, but I think that to be competitive you'd need diamond + players in order to have a shot. I'd be willing to join in if you need numbers, but I really do think there'd be a few diamond/master/challenger players at Curtin who'd be able to do a much better job. \n{{item:3070}} {{item:3070}} {{item:3070}}","replies":[{"poster":"Shes my Princess","date":"2015-07-21T17:28:30.347+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Curtin doesn't have a LoL Facebook page that I can see, maybe you'd like to set that up and get input from there?","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Want2play","date":"2015-07-30T23:57:25.517+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yo!
