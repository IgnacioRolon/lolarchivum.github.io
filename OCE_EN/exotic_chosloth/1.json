The skin I came up resolves more around the fear aspect itself.\r\n\r\n(this would be an ultimate skin at least)\r\n\r\nPhobia Fiddlesticks\r\n\r\nthis skin would adapt to the enemy champions that fiddlesticks is around. what this means is that the skin effects and appearance would differ to suit the fears of a nearby enemy champion.\r\n\r\nexamples being:\r\n\r\n1: if Phobia Fiddle is near Lux then he would turn into more of a nightmarish dark character with abilities that contrast with Lux&#039;s potential fears.\r\n\r\n2: if phobia Fiddle is near a dark champion such as Cho&#039;gath then he will take a lighter mushy sort of figure that would be Cho&#039;s fear\r\n\r\nnow what this skin can also provide is different character depth for each champion, showing what they are scared of. the problem for this skin is that you cannot keep adjusting it to every new champion that comes out as well as giving Fiddle a different form for every separate champion in the game. so in short you would need to set several different forms for Fiddle to take for select groups of champions. though Fiddlesticks himself is a little bit outdated the skin itself is reflective of his character and has a good placing as an ultimate skin because of it&#039;s ability to change depending on situations.\r\n\r\nthoughts or ideas?","replies":[{"poster":"Psylock1234","date":"2018-01-07T10:28:36.210+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"would it be a rainbow in a 5v5 team fight??","replies":[{"poster":"exotic chosloth","date":"2018-01-07T21:29:17.645+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"hopefully not. maybe it adjusts to who you last put your q (terrify) on and won't change until you fear the next person.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"TheDemonEmperor","date":"2018-01-07T11:45:20.210+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Stick figure fiddle. 1 line down for the body and 4 line for the limb.","replies":[]}]}
