I&#039;m in Gold 5 - 0 points. Which is honestly pretty pathetic, whenever I play, due to my win/loss my mmr puts me with most of the time s4-s1 and i can feel the massive skill gap, the csing, the dodging, the amount of warding, barely anyone creates a comp to win a match etc. I also don&#039;t have a rank partner, the people I would duo with are now either higher tier than me or quit. Rank is just now a hassle I don&#039;t feel the drive to play and rank up, it&#039;s become not boring but exhausting, play a 50 min game only just to lose. Play a 20 min game with people arguing with each other. Normals have become games where you have to try hard all the time, the fun is sapped from it as the match making puts you against higher tier players half the time and you just end up being dominated. Toxics are both in rank and non rank. There is just no fun. URF itself is a try hard mode. ARAM I suppose is the only game mode that I think fondly of. \r\n\r\nWhat can I do to make league fun again?","replies":[{"poster":"Lynxmetal","date":"2015-04-12T03:32:21.402+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Just play normal games if you're tilting, pick champs that you know you're going to have fun playing or just try new champs/positions that you don't play very much and just enjoy yourself. I'm sort of at that stage and I just play champs that I used to play when I first started and it's actually the most fun I've had on Lol in months, even if I lose if I have a good time I don't really care. Ranked is just a hassle and it feels pointless putting up with all the crap you have to in ranked just for a pixel medal.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Blackavar","date":"2015-04-11T00:25:46.408+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"play jarvan IV bot lane with someone with a knockup","replies":[]},{"poster":"Arcanopulse","date":"2015-04-10T05:57:44.121+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Get better.

When I start doing that I improved and won more than I lost because I stopped stressing about others losing their lanes and broke down my own gameplay to where I can affect the game as a whole. Stressing achieves nothing but anxiety and is pointless. Also realise that some games you're just going to lose regardless.\n\nIn short, worry less about others and just focus on your own gameplay without stressing too much about the result. You learn more from a loss than a win and this game is about improving over time, not reaching challenger in 100 games.","replies":[]},{"poster":"SEKAI","date":"2015-04-09T16:33:17.446+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Get friends to play with you, otherwise it's the same cycle over again.\n\nOr you can just quit to play other games/activities that you would enjoy more.","replies":[]}]}
