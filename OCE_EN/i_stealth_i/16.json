He can also transition into a complete peel support extremely well if needed.\n\n\n\n+ Blitzcrank probably has better playmaking than Thresh, but he's super binary. You either hit the hook, or you don't. There's not many other options past that.\n\n His peel is also quite average late game, especially if you need to peel more than 1 person off the ADC.","replies":[{"poster":"Nightjar","date":"2017-01-19T03:11:20.282+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thresh is also harder to play and has better defensive peel but less options to kill an opponent once grabbed.

He can hook and pull you under tower, through a wall and late game if you hook an ADC you can win the game single handedly. Tha being said, if you hook in a Leona or something, you can also single handedly lose the game.\nBlitz is VERY simple, Q+E+R. Repeat. You can also do things like W and run at the enemy to E first then Q so you dont miss. But he is very 1 track style of play.\n\nThresh provides a lot more than just a hook. His Flay is useful for cancelling many other champion abilities and his lantern is probably one of the most useful abilities in the game.\nThresh is useful when ahead as a playmaker and when behind as a life saver. He provides a lot more utility to the team however he requires follow up.\n\nYou can hook, take the hook and try to lantern your teammate, but if they dont want to follow up because \"its a bad idea\", you're screwed.\nBlitz on the other hand, hooking someone forces fights immediately (for better or worse).\n\nIts a lot easier to be a good Blitz than a good Thresh.","replies":[]}]}
