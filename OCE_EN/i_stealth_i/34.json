Depending on the situations it's a  lot that goes into his full burst potential.\n\nW then Q auto ult auto (passive starts) then hydra auto again. All up its like 2-3sec for his full bust. Not to menion if you wait for dusk blade passive.","replies":[]},{"poster":"I Stealth I","date":"2017-02-22T01:35:12.248+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I believe that Talon needs more skill in order to utilise his kit well.\n\nFor instance, you shouldn't always try to proc your passive as it can cause you to get caught out and die\n\nThe use of your Q is also important. You could use it as an engage during your ultimate or you could use the crit to dish out massive damage **OR** use the heal for sustain in lane\n\nSpamming W in lane is a big no-no for Talon mains because running out of mana can prove to be fatal, especially in the laning phase. It's ok to use W to harass but **ONLY** if you know that you'll land both parts of it.\n\nTalon's E requires a lot of predictions. Just spamming it can leave you with no escape at all. That's why most Talons won't use their E unless they are chasing or escaping.\n\nFinally Talon's ultimate needs at least a little skill to utilise it well. Most people assume that Talon's ultimate is used for escapes since it grants invisibility.  Chaining it with Q to open an all in combo that can secure a kill.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Kakoda","date":"2017-02-21T08:02:43.771+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=StealthVortex88,realm=OCE,application-id=FjGAIbRv,discussion-id=ibmxn3ax,comment-id=,timestamp=2017-02-20T22:24:04.574+0000)\n>\n> With assassins like Talon and Zed utilising lethality so well, it&amp;#039;ll be soon that either they get nerfed or lethality gets nerfed.

Lvl 2 he can jump you and insta kill you, though he needs to hit you with 3 abilities and then an auto attack. Dodge his W on the way back and you're fine he can't jump you.\n\nHe should not be able to kill you if he doesn't land his combo and it's Simi decent to dodge anyways.","replies":[{"poster":"FerrousOxide","date":"2017-02-21T08:11:41.390+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The fact he can passive stack and instakill then snowball is pretty broken.

He needs to snow ball early. Come late game he can't even kill adc instantly. Seriously early he is a huge pain late not so much.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"CHEESYLEEKS","date":"2017-02-21T01:05:02.840+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"just talon and zed? try nearly every ad champ.","replies":[{"poster":"I Stealth I","date":"2017-02-21T02:25:26.526+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Looks like I fucked up with my context again -.-\n\nWhat I meant was that the reason lethality was buffed was because Talon and Zed need it to have the power they need.
