Even though, I do well as Talon Jungle, we lose game because of a throw or afk. But, all and all, I try my best to get an S, be it farming, ganking a lot or just warding whenever I can. Looking at my match history, I see my KDA, warding and kill participation fine, but my CS is bad. I guess I have the mentality of stopping farm if I get fed. The main question being, how much CS must I have at the 20 min interval, the 30 minute interval and the 40 minute interval?\r\n\r\nAnswer would be much appreciated!","replies":[{"poster":"Qilli","date":"2017-01-05T05:18:24.615+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"tax lane, kill adc to get a good kda, tiamat is needed as jg talon rush before anything else.","replies":[{"poster":"Talon12","date":"2017-01-05T05:33:42.911+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Its not needed as a rush, its like taking tiamat on hybrid shaco, its a good snowball item rush for him but its not needed","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"CHEESYLEEKS","date":"2017-01-05T03:36:41.717+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"try and tax lane minions and the enemy jungle if your ahead.","replies":[]}]}
