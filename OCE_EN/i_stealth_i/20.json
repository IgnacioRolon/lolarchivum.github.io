As the E slowed you and Q does bonus damage **AND** your damage against the target is amplified, you could just chunk half their health and finish them off with W. The new Talon actually needs planning. You need to know when to proc your passve, where to reposition when the W and most importantly, they can&#039;t double tap their R like the old Talon and one shot you. Talon has far more counterplay now but he still has the snowballing as the old Talon did so don&#039;t feed him","replies":[{"poster":"Lord Sesshomaru","date":"2016-11-29T23:37:04.855+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Im not saying you're right or wrong.\n\nIm just saying that people can convince themselves that Yasuo is balanced...\n\nYou say: \n\"New talon: 3 hit passive\" and just pass it off like that. completely ignoring that the bleed does upwards of 800 damage...\nwhich is tons more damage than the old passive ever did.\n\nNew talon does far more damage than the old one (by far!)\n\nThe new talon doesn't really have any more or less counterplay than the old one _(at least not for the people who need it like the ADC)_ he still deletes squishies in under half a second, regardless of what you do. \n\nThe new talon is harder and more interesting than the old one, which in my opinion makes him better. \nBut to be clear, his counterplay is hardly more noticeable than the old one.","replies":[{"poster":"Requiemsfire","date":"2016-12-01T16:27:48.625+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Having played the old Talon and even reaching mastery 6 Talon, before his update I can definitely tell you the old Talon was stronger. He's combo might do in terms of numbers more, but that doesn't change the fact that all the damage is gated by a 3 hit combo+ auto where as you can instagib a squishy before by simply, Ult, Q W and they're dead. But the added delay on his burst takes it's toll significantly reflected in his 9% ( was originally 11) drop in winrate following his rework simply because he needs to get in that one auto attack. \n\nHis laning is also much weaker simply because he's more prone to being bullied pre-6 by any mid laner with CC which is literally every mid laner. \nRight now, if you want to climb, if you want to do well, I'd honestly recommend steering away from Talon.","replies":[{"poster":"I Stealth I","date":"2016-12-01T22:11:19.005+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Talon can be an extremely strong pick if you can utilise him correctly in certain situations.

Either way, old Talon's combo is relatively static and doesn't offer much flexbility whereas now new Talon can use his E in different ways to combo differently. I think my favorite is catching someone over a wall with Q (1 stack), using R out and W (3 stacks), AAing for passive and jumping back over the wall as your W and R come back to you (and thus through them again). Of course that's situational as well but new Talon is more flexible, that's for sure.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Xenonfrenzy","date":"2016-11-30T02:28:54.881+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"His scalings are way more than before tho","replies":[]},{"poster":"Chalze","date":"2016-11-29T23:39:58.063+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I thought he was considered weak or something..\nHere's my 2 cents on the topic now that I play Talon a ton\n\nHis Q seems more innovative since the damage is there but you can also choose between mobility or damage. His old Q was a bit boring and too simple to use. His W has more counterplay just because of the delay and relatively smaller cone size but also landing both portions of damage is more rewarding since it has more base and scaling than old Talon (I think). His old E was far too generic, and although I must say his pre-rework 'new E' was weaker than his pre-rework 'old E' since it slowed for 99% rather than his old old silence (which actually made him notorious), his new E does now require planning as you said and gives him map presence to the extreme without needing to make him another champion with some form of global TP (or very very long range TP like Panth or TF). Lastly I dunno about you but his R seems pretty much the same so yeah.\n\nThe old old Talon was notorious which got nerfed (his pre-rework 'new E') with the slow but I always felt like that slow was pretty much pointless since your W and Q couldn't be used at the same time (for good reason). Like you would E to them and by the time you Q them for the dmg they could've walked to point blank range which then your W would've been hard to hit, or else you could E to them, use W first and then Q which apparently I was the only person doing it back then. The new Talon doesn't have to worry about trying to proc Q when he had his 'Mercy' passive so that means more flexibility in ability usage. Also since he was a '4 ability' assassin and now his E made him a '3 ability' assassin, his damage actually isn't as notorious as people say he is. But since his E is essentially 'situational' mobility (e.g. you can't just dash freely like Lucian or Shen) his Q makes up for that in terms of being a target dash which again you can choose between damage or mobility.\n\nBasically i feel like the new Talon is what Riot envisioned all assassins to be, someone who does apply burst damage if used correctly, needs planning so they don't just 'see someone and burst them' and most of all, a proper 'flanker' due to his E. \n\nAll in all he is healthier for sure, but depending on what people want or need, he may need some minor number changes, but his new kit is definitely here to stay. \n\nBy the way I know I shouldn't base it entirely on this but to the people who say Talon's OP: his winrate is hovering around 46% to 48%","replies":[]}]}
