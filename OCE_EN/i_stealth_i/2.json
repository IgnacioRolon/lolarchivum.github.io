In your opinion, who is the champion most needed of a nerf?\r\n\r\n1. {{champion:122}} : This guy&#039;s rework quite possibly screwed us over. You give a tanky as hell melee fighter a bleed, a bonus attack damage passive, a pull, a heal and a true damage ultimate. This guy almost 100% wrecks your lane if you&#039;re against him.\r\n\r\n2. {{champion:114}} : Seriously, this chick is broken as well. If you build full tank Fiora, you needn&#039;t worry about damage. Your passive allows you to do true bonus damage if you auto their &#039;vital&#039;, but her Q allows her to prioritise that area and guarantee that true damage.  And you&#039;re ult is PERCENT HEALTH TRUE DAMAGE., full tank Fiora is completely broken and definitely needs a nerf\r\n\r\n3. {{champion:157}} : I used to be a Yasuo main until I realised that Yasuo was cancerous as hell. You build full crit with him and he can just delete that health bar, or you could build full tank and just mow down the enemy team anyway. His bonus armour penetration nerf seems to have calmed his dominance, but it doesn&#039;t seem to be enough.\r\n\r\nPlease leave your opinion in the poll below and let me know if I may have missed anybody.","replies":[{"poster":"Soulless Reaper","date":"2016-11-03T23:07:31.369+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Yasuo doesn't need a nerf.. That is the whole point of his kit is to delete someone, I main Yasuo and Yasuo is indeed very easy to counter and to pop him like a squishy, the best tip against a Yasuo is to constantly harass him in lane, make Yasuo fall behind in early game and you won't have any issues till around the 40 minute mark. But Darius is just fucking stupid, not even at the slightest his he balanced and so is Fiora.. Even though Riot decided buffing Fiora would be a smart idea","replies":[{"poster":"Struggle","date":"2016-11-03T23:23:26.399+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"You could say that about any champ though, just harass them in lane and make them fall behind early.","replies":[{"poster":"Soulless Reaper","date":"2016-11-04T00:09:58.908+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Well no. Because some champs thrive early game. Yasuo doesn't, you need to shut him down. People complain about Yas because no one does anything to shut him down early so he gets free farm, the odd kills and he just builds up to the point where he will laugh about  a 3v1. Shut him down early and he will be useless for 3/4 of the game","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Talon12","date":"2016-11-03T09:49:24.491+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"You know what sets yasuo apart from darius and fiora? you guessed it.

Whilst he can be almost impossible to deal with in terms of a solo lane if you get counterpicked (since his early game isn't nearly as weak as people claim), yasou can be shut down by the presence of certain abilities and types of cc and peel in a teamcomp. The issue lies in the fact that in soloq you might not have these things, and unless you get some scrub jungler like a shaco, leesin, eveylnn or pantheon, you're probably not going to get the very early jungle pressure needed to put him behind enough that he can't catchup.\n\nYasou is definitely one of the strongest champions in the game, evident from his ridiculous pick rates in every elo and the high winrates he spouts across these elos. I do believe that simply based on how much you have to play around him, and his success in both high and low elo, he still needs a nerf (personally I'd go about targeting either his dash damage of cutting about a fifth of windwalls duration when cast, I feel these nerfs wouldn't be very noticeable but would pull him more into line) however he isn't really broken and it's not like he doesn't have bad lane matchups which he will struggle with.\n\nI feel the reasons people hate yasou so much though, is you rarely find 'nice', 'friendly' or 'chill' yasou mains. They're always bming or telling you how trash you are whilst talking about how hard yasou is and how noob your champion is, even if you're winning lane and you're playing something that's also considered just as, if not harder, like Azir. It doesn't matter if he's on your team or theirs, carrying or feeding, he's almost never nice, or even silent. They're often toxic keyboard warriors, even in ranked when you went out of your way to make a knockup comp for him.\n\nAnd you see Yasou in pretty much every game, and if you're in ranked and the enemy bans yasou, your yasou main midlaner is going to dodge, or if you ban yasou, the enemy yasou main is going to dodge, and sometimes the yasou main on your team will just feed and blame for you for letting yasou get banned (what do you me expect to do?).","replies":[{"poster":"Talon12","date":"2016-11-04T06:50:56.282+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Nightjar,realm=OCE,application-id=Ntey9fRZ,discussion-id=2wAZePsA,comment-id=00020000,timestamp=2016-11-04T02:19:57.294+0000)\n>\n> or they got counterpicked and they have all long cooldown skillshots and nobody else on their team had the creativity to pick champions with cc and abilities that can&#x27;t be windwalled.\n> \n> In all fairness Yasou is not that broken, he&#x27;s a metaslave champion with extremely high damage and an overloaded kit, he&#x27;s extremely snowbally, to the point he can almost solo carry a game but since he&#x27;s melee and somewhat squishy he can also fall behind to the point it can be very hard to recover and until then won&#x27;t offer much to his team until maybe lategame.
