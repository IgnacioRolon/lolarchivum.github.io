To be honest, I don't know why I find him so much fun, I just do. You would think farming for 30 minutes just to be strong in the late game is boring, but for some reason I never get bored of it. Also URF nasus and AP nasus is just infinite fun. Never gets old.\n____\n\n{{champion:83}}  - Honestly, what the fuck rito? First of all, OLD yorick was more fun than this crap, and this new yorick is straight up broken as heck! There is literally no counter play to this guy if you get stuck against him as someone like Wukong or Nasus. And his ghouls are so fucking stupid! I mean you can build this guy 6 warmogs and have no damage runes whatsoever and still 1v5 the enemy team.
