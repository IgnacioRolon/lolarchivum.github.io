It runs for Windows but not on Mac.\n\nTHIS IS NOT MY CREATION\n\nCreds to the maker of it, it&#039;s a very helpful tool but it isn&#039;t updated for S7.\n\nSo some items and masteries are missing but it&#039;s still helpful.\n\n* Hope you guys find it useful!\n\nIt gives the exact stats of a champion based on items and level as well!","replies":[{"poster":"Kakoda","date":"2017-02-28T22:48:44.874+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I have not checked it out, though from the little you said about it seems a bit out dated and also makes just a generic build.\n\nIf you want a build try an app called lolsumo it will give you a build for the game you are playing. It will take into account who you lane vs and there team and your team and make a build accordingly. \n\nIt's also great if you want to know what area of the game you need to improve in. Will tell you your cs gold kills deaths and what level they are in. If you pay to unlock extra features (I have not done so) you can get a time line with that also. You will see trends. So maybe 20-30 min you spend to much time farming not fighting or 0-15 to much time ganuking for farming these kind of things.\n\nPretty good app if you ask me.","replies":[{"poster":"Nightjar","date":"2017-03-01T03:10:42.383+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"lolsumo is pretty decent when it comes to build customisation, though if you're used to theorycrafting and having a flexible build, it's always better to buy the item you feel you need the most at the moment. For instance if the enemy midlane fizz gets really fed, you might want to consider building rushing an edge of night or maw on rengar over ghostblade, or buying ninjatabi or cleaver and focus more on trying to make bigger plays toplane against the enemy riven and bot where the enemy damage is mostly ad and just try to avoid fizz.","replies":[]}]}]}
