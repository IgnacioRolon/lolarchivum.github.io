The arch surrounding his gun looks Ionian and it just reminds me of Irelia, because of how it looks like the gateway to a temple and floats in the air.\n\nOr maybe it could just be another garen or riven skin because we definitely need more of those.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Infireus","date":"2017-01-26T20:09:57.277+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Blood moon Azir.
