They can make your champion look completely different and awesome. But the lack of skins on some champions is just absurd. Its pretty unfair, tbh.\r\n\r\nFor example;\r\n\r\n{{champion:91}}  Talon, released in 2011, has 3 skins (1 legacy)\r\n{{champion:103}}  Ahri, released late 2011, has 6 skins (1 legacy)\r\n\r\nOne can justify this as Ahri is **FAR** more popular than Talon (being a Talon main doesn&#039;t mean I&#039;m biased)\r\n\r\n\r\nAnother example:\r\n\r\n{{champion:245}}  Ekko, released in 2015, has 3 skins\r\n\r\n{{champion:429}}  Kalista, released in 2014, has 3 skins (2 legacy)\r\n\r\nThis is honestly a bad situation for Kalista mains who have to wait for LCS every year to grab a different Kalista. It has only been 1 year and a couple of months since Ekko&#039;s release\r\n\r\n\r\nAnd ffs, Zac {{champion:154}}  only has 2 skins and has been out for 4 years\r\n\r\nSo how does Rito decide which champ deserves skins?","replies":[{"poster":"shalexade","date":"2016-12-06T11:14:58.553+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Wouldn't hold my breath on Zac\n\nhttp://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/miscellaneous/JGd68MaB-zac-skins","replies":[{"poster":"Zorphiax","date":"2016-12-06T20:30:34.640+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Zac can also be rather hard to do skins for as well. (a good skin I mean cause anyone can make a skin whether its good or not is another question) Because, He doesn't have clothes and it isn't really that good if you just change the color.","replies":[]}]}]}
