The thing was, she was level 3 and I was only level 2. I got pretty low due to her Q and was farming under tower. Eventually, I got poked so much i was forced further under the tower. Then, Taliyah dives me. She was full health and I had a quarter of health. She Ws but I walk away from it just as she deploys her E. She&#039;s right next to me now, so I point blank Q her and she dies. In the all chat pops, &quot;wow, Riot really needs to nerf Talon, such a no skill broken champ&quot;\r\n\r\nI mean, yes, Talon is one of the easiest champs to play but if you set yourself up for a stupid dive and get yourself killed, it&#039;s your fault, not the champion&#039;s. It&#039;s the same if you die to a Thresh when you tried to dive him but he CCs you until the turret agro kills you. It&#039;s not just the champion that made you die, it was yourself as well. Turret diving is a high risk, high reward task in the early game, yes but you have to think about the circumstances and if your enemy has the potential to kite your abilities.\r\n\r\nMoral of the Story? Don&#039;t dive a champion, die and blame the champion for being no skill/broken because you died.\r\n\r\nand yes, Talon probably does need some nerfs","replies":[{"poster":"Talon12","date":"2017-03-25T10:35:15.513+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"they are nerfing his q anyway","replies":[]},{"poster":"CHEESYLEEKS","date":"2017-03-25T04:52:55.793+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"But talon is no skill?","replies":[{"poster":"I Stealth I","date":"2017-03-25T04:58:14.714+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"probably.  he can be binary and you can just R -> Q someone and they'll probably get one shot.","replies":[{"poster":"Talon12","date":"2017-03-25T10:34:32.673+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Not unless he has 400 ad and they have less than 1k hp you cant.","replies":[]}]}]}]}
