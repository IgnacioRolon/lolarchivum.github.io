Is it only me who gets confused when a &#039;Blood Moon Shen&#039; kills me and the kill feed doesn&#039;t show a demonic mask but rather a ninja? There are more skins that have that feels but bear with me. So, why not use a different icon for the champion if they are using a skin?","replies":[{"poster":"SkarSkarSkarner","date":"2017-01-25T21:45:03.340+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"For clarity Riot keeps all the champion icons as their default.","replies":[]}]}
