However they have said that doing things that help win the game will help you get a higher mastery rank.\n\n---\n\nFrom this generally what I like to do in this situation is think about what I could have done better in the game and helped out my team more as it can be a good way to think about the mastery system. Maybe it is the case that you could have died less, gotten a few more kills, placed more wards or taken an extra tower or two. \n\nSo think back to this game that you played and see if you can find areas that you could have played better and improved on from that game. S ranks can be hard to get sometimes and often require you to really be doing a lot to help your team win the game. So if it is the case that you didn't get an S rank, find a way that you could have done better and use it as a mark to help you improve your gameplay.\n\n---\n\nIf you would like to look at Riot's specific statement about what they have said for getting a mastery rank, you can have a look here:\n\n> **What is in the champ mastery grades formula?**\nThe grades you receive are driven by how you rank against all other players in your region who also played your champion and position across various performance categories. We don’t reveal the exact formula so that it can’t be min-maxed as we really want to avoid incentivizing playing for stats like CS or K/D/A rather than playing to win. However, the variables are fairly intuitive in terms of what you would expect to be important to winning.\n\n> -Riot Socrates, Lead Game Designer\n\n---\n\nIf there is anything I can clarify on with this let me know or if there are any other questions that you have let me know as well. Good luck in your games :3\n\n~Elam","replies":[{"poster":"I Stealth I","date":"2017-01-18T03:33:41.927+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thanks, Elam","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Niji","date":"2017-01-18T03:26:29.060+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"CS needs to be higher.
