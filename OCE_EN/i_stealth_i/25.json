I may have decent game knowledge but I&#039;m not necessarily the best player. I just found some nice tricks that lower ELO players SHOULD be doing but they just tend to not do it. These tricks will most definitely make lower ELO  less hellish and bring more wins\r\n\r\nTip #1: Always smart ping\r\n             Whether it be to tell your team you&#039;re coming to gank or you need assistance in lane, smart pings should be used as much as possible. When I roam in most of my games, I tend to ping the lane that I&#039;m &#039;on my way&#039; to. If the lane doesn&#039;t want a gank, they simply ping back a &#039;Danger&#039; Ping. It really helps to know what your team wants and letting them know what you&#039;re doing without writing constantly in the chat.\r\n\r\nTip #2: Kills aren&#039;t everything\r\nMost players in lower ELO tend to get tilted when they die constantly to their lane opponent but they never seem to know that farming will help them catch up or get ahead. Farm is one of the most neglected and least effective skill a low ELO player has (including myself, I&#039;m pretty guilty of missing CS). Most players will give up when they&#039;re 0/3 to that Zed but with a bit of farming, they&#039;ll catch up and hopefully get those kills back.\r\n\r\nTip #3: Adapt to your team&#039;s needs\r\nYou&#039;ve just aced the enemy team and you can Baron but your team wants to push into their base. Normally, a lower ELO player will just try solo Baron while their team is missing a crucial member of the team. It&#039;s always important that you aren&#039;t toxic to your team by not listening to them. Sometimes, getting Baron rather than pushing their base while all of them are dead for 40+ seconds can cost you the game (been there, done that). Similarly, if the Ahri mid is having trouble against that Ekko and you&#039;ve underfed your enemy Ryze at top, feel free to ask to swap lanes to help your teammates.\r\n\r\nTip #4: Always Ward\r\nWarding is commonly associated as the support&#039;s job as they can hold more wards than most of the team. Just because this is the case doesn&#039;t mean that you shouldn&#039;t ward either. The entire team shares the &#039;3 wards at once&#039; cap and you have a trinket that allows you FREE wards. Although many would take the trinket upgrade at lvl 9, the normal warding trinket is always a strong pick. Also, always by a control ward and set them up at likely invade areas.\r\n\r\nTip #5: Always encourage your teammates\r\nThis may be the hardest thing lower ELO players will have following. It&#039;s never ok to diss your teammates on their performance (as for that matter, the enemy as well). You could put them on tilt and that could cost you the game. Toxicity can ruin an experience, not just their&#039;s but the team&#039;s as well. If they&#039;re doing bad, give them some tips to catch up and do well later. Just don&#039;t be toxic\r\n\r\nHopefully this helped some of you.....if you even read it.
