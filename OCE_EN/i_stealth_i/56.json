I&#039;ve had 2 bad games lately and I was pretty shocked, since I don&#039;t normally do that bad. Is it a normal thing when you do bad with your main, especially when you one trick that champion?","replies":[{"poster":"Captain Fortune","date":"2017-01-22T02:16:35.937+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":2,"body":"Greetings again StealthVortex88,\n\nI think that having bad games on the champions that you play a lot or having bad games in general is a very normal thing. Sometimes you can just be having off days, in a rough match up or something in your play style or set up has changed that needs adjusting too. Every so often I find myself having bad days on my champions in Akali and Draven and find it best to take a break from playing them or asses what is causing me to have these off-games.\n\n---\n\n**The first thing I try to look at is my gameplay,** maybe I am dying too much on them and that is something I can learn from, maybe I am not mechanically up to par with what I usually am, or it could come down to something as simple as I had a few rough matchups. \n\nIf you can asses if it is a part of your gameplay that you need to improve this is something really good, this is a chance to improve at something that is for your favourite champion and it something that you should be very happy about. When you are having these bad games, look for patterns in your mistakes and try removing the bad habits that you notice that you have.\n\n---\n\n**The other thing is mentality.** Sometimes you can be thinking to yourself, whats going on I am having bad games I can't play this champion anymore etc etc and it gets really frustrating. Thinking this way can sometimes be the fault that is causing you to play badly. Mentality is a huge part of league of legends and is something that should be considered when you are trying to fix something like this. \n\nTry to keep a positive attitude and think to yourself ok I know I am not playing as well as I usually do, because of this what can I improve on? Don't beat yourself up if you are having a few bad games, its completely normal. \n\nConsider also having some breaks, both from pacing yourself in the amount of games you play, maybe take a break have a shower, something to mentally reset yourself and also consider taking a break and playing a different champion just for a few games so that you can come back to Talon fresh and ready to play to the best of your ability.\n\n---\n\nI hope that this helps, if there is any way I can help or any other questions I can answer let me know. Just remember that having bad games is completely normal, even on champions that you main or one trick. Keep going and keep a positive mindset and you'll get back to normal in no time. Good luck in your games!\n\n~Elam","replies":[{"poster":"I Stealth I","date":"2017-01-22T03:37:32.698+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"ty","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"FatedSaviour","date":"2017-02-03T04:06:10.967+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"lol i vs u one game and i was wondering where i saw ur username, the forums is from where LOOOOOOOOL, anyway, yes it is normal, especially if  your tilted, triggered, items got changed, or your vs someone whose a total teemo to fight (teemo, caitlyn, camile, marksman top lane)","replies":[{"poster":"I Stealth I","date":"2017-02-03T06:13:37.731+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I played against you?

I've played 100+ games on nasus this season and have had many off games, the other day i went something like 2/11 and still won because i know exactly how to get carried on nasus, i see how my adc is attacking and drop an e, i see someone annoying my midlaner i throw a w on them.\nMy moto for nasus is keep calm and farm so its really easy to be consistant with him.\n\nThats the biggest points of having a main champion you learn to carry and get carried with them.\n\nAlso its not like your always going to be the 20 kill guy who carries and gets a penta every game.","replies":[]}]}
