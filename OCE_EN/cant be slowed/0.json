So this is not an issue with my internet at all, everything is fine, only as soon as I get into a game, not even in the champion lobby, I have tested multiple times in customs and still same thing. 50 ping constant and then as soon as the game loads up 3k Ping plus. I have tried repairing league and has not done anything, so if anyone has a sollution or can tell me why this is happening, would be great, because league is unplayable.

Run a **trace route** to the OCE server (Start menu > type \"cmd\" > Open the command prompt > type \"tracert 103.240.227.5\"). The server itself won't respond (you'll start getting no responses), but it should give a clear idea of where that ping is coming from, especially if it's consistent. ~~\n2. Screenshot the trace route and submit it in a ticket to **Player Support** (https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/requests/new) and they should be able to help you further.\n","replies":[]}]}
