Not one curse word was used, but yet I get told to kill myself all the time and get people yelling in chat and saying every name under the sun, they don&#039;t get a ban. But as soon as I get a couple trolls on my team, who are there to troll and not to play the game, as soon as I say anything, apparently it doesn&#039;t even matter what for, they can report me for not agreeing with their life decisions, and riot will automatically ban me without going through any chat logs or anything. So I really want a good answer as to why I have been chat restricted for 25 games, I have not broken one rule but yet still get banned, this is honestly a joke. These are the full chat logs of the 3 games where apparently, I was &#039;aggro&#039; and &#039;toxic&#039;. Get a grip riot, and actually ban the people who are ruining the game and who are actually toxic, otherwise, don&#039;t ban innocent players who haven&#039;t broken a rule.\r\n\r\nGame 1\r\nCant Be Slowed: lets go\r\nCant Be Slowed: okay\r\nCant Be Slowed: enjoy the game :)\r\nCant Be Slowed: i am :)\r\nCant Be Slowed: i get trolled in all my promo game\r\nCant Be Slowed: so\r\nCant Be Slowed: :)\r\nCant Be Slowed: lag\r\nCant Be Slowed: hahahahahaha\r\nCant Be Slowed: xD\r\nCant Be Slowed: so funny\r\nCant Be Slowed: last game was\r\nCant Be Slowed: ez\r\nCant Be Slowed: hahahaha\r\nCant Be Slowed: xD\r\nCant Be Slowed: cant let him miss out\r\nCant Be Slowed: so am i\r\nCant Be Slowed: no\r\nCant Be Slowed: never\r\nCant Be Slowed: ezreal was\r\nCant Be Slowed: what fror?\r\nCant Be Slowed: i dont know how to play riven\r\nCant Be Slowed: cant report for bad player\r\nCant Be Slowed: :/\r\nCant Be Slowed: unlucky man\r\nCant Be Slowed: see you next game :)\r\nCant Be Slowed: no im not lol\r\nCant Be Slowed: i got the day off\r\nCant Be Slowed: im extremely happy\r\nCant Be Slowed: \\nah\r\nCant Be Slowed: dont ff\r\nCant Be Slowed: youre the only one upset lmfao xD\r\nCant Be Slowed: you thought you could feed and get carried\r\nCant Be Slowed: xD\r\nCant Be Slowed: we reporting ez for toxicity?\r\nCant Be Slowed: that report doesnt work mate\r\nCant Be Slowed: cant get reported for having a bad game :)\r\nCant Be Slowed: or just being bad\r\nCant Be Slowed: im not mad\r\nCant Be Slowed: you made my night man\r\nCant Be Slowed: its okay baby\r\nCant Be Slowed: hehe xD\r\nCant Be Slowed: dunno\r\nCant Be Slowed: yeah dude\r\nCant Be Slowed: new patch\r\nCant Be Slowed: :(\r\nCant Be Slowed: nah\r\nCant Be Slowed: i tried my best :(\r\nCant Be Slowed: shame\r\nCant Be Slowed: we couldve won\r\nCant Be Slowed: im the complete opposite\r\nCant Be Slowed: :)\r\nCant Be Slowed: gg\r\nGame 2\r\nCant Be Slowed: nice!\r\nCant Be Slowed: ?????\r\nCant Be Slowed: i think twitch is trolling\r\nCant Be Slowed: lmfao\r\nCant Be Slowed: can we report twitch pleasE?\r\nCant Be Slowed: trolling and afking\r\nCant Be Slowed: tryuing to take my jng\r\nCant Be Slowed: abusing?\r\nCant Be Slowed: how have i abused\r\nCant Be Slowed: he started trolling\r\nCant Be Slowed: for no reason\r\nCant Be Slowed: cant even have a good game of league\r\nCant Be Slowed: without some baby crying because he lost lane\r\nCant Be Slowed: then trolling\r\nCant Be Slowed: ruining everyone elses game\r\nCant Be Slowed: wait\r\nCant Be Slowed: twitch and veigar are duo\r\nCant Be Slowed: why do you play with him veigar lol\r\nCant Be Slowed: well no twitch just afked and started trying to steal my jungle\r\nCant Be Slowed: so id say thats a bannable offence\r\nCant Be Slowed: well enjoy the ban twith\r\nCant Be Slowed: well deserved\r\nCant Be Slowed: please get him banned\r\nCant Be Slowed: ^\r\nCant Be Slowed: because im saying to report the trolling adc\r\nCant Be Slowed: apparently thats bannable\r\nCant Be Slowed: this duo man\r\nCant Be Slowed: man it doesnt matter\r\nCant Be Slowed: youre duo with him\r\nCant Be Slowed: noone witha  brain would fend of anyone from this guy\r\nCant Be Slowed: it is blatant\r\nCant Be Slowed: lmfao\r\nCant Be Slowed: because youre so good\r\nCant Be Slowed: xD\r\nCant Be Slowed: youve obviously got a few accounts banned\r\nCant Be Slowed: so enjoy this one\r\nCant Be Slowed: spend more money on rp\r\nCant Be Slowed: and accounts\r\nCant Be Slowed: enjoy your loss\r\nCant Be Slowed: report twithc\r\nCant Be Slowed: please\r\nGame 3\r\nCant Be Slowed: okay\r\nCant Be Slowed: another promos lost today\r\nCant Be Slowed: wheres our jungler?\r\nCant Be Slowed: noone know\r\nCant Be Slowed: wheres our top?\r\nCant Be Slowed: cant cs\r\nCant Be Slowed: bot?\r\nCant Be Slowed: same\r\nCant Be Slowed: mhm\r\nCant Be Slowed: youre actually so good shen\r\nCant Be Slowed: dw\r\nCant Be Slowed: my bot will keep fightiong\r\nCant Be Slowed: they have lost almost every time\r\nCant Be Slowed: but if they keep fighting\r\nCant Be Slowed: they might win\r\nCant Be Slowed: why do i even let other people jng\r\nCant Be Slowed: sick flash vayne\r\nCant Be Slowed: LMFAO\r\nCant Be Slowed: so a 4v3\r\nCant Be Slowed: you still lose\r\nCant Be Slowed: hahahahahahahahahahahahahahaahahaha\r\nCant Be Slowed: youre right\r\nCant Be Slowed: but i mean\r\nCant Be Slowed: id say that to you\r\nCant Be Slowed: but id get banned\r\nCant Be Slowed: so enjoy :)\r\nCant Be Slowed: well no\r\nCant Be Slowed: :)\r\nCant Be Slowed: if not a ban\r\nCant Be Slowed: so enjoy the banned accoutn haha\r\nCant Be Slowed: obviously not\r\nCant Be Slowed: you inted anyway \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSo If anywhere here you see anything that breaks the rules of league of legends, please let me know and will happily take the ban, but honestly riot this is pathetic. I get people coming in my games and raging there whole day away at the keyboard at someone who hasn&#039;t had the best game and yet they don&#039;t seem to get banned at all, what is the go with this, honestly really disappointing, to a game I&#039;ve put tons of hours into, this is what comes out of it. Really going down hill, really makes me not want to play your game.","replies":[{"poster":"SuicidalPhreak","date":"2017-12-07T14:52:23.466+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"+rep good trader","replies":[]}]}
