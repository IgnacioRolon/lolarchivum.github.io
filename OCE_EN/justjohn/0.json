I&#039;m then placed back into the client lobby with a 30-minute dodge penalty & 20 lp lost. I don&#039;t understand why the issue happens, is it happening to anyone else? Because I beleive if it happens again ill develop a fatal brain aneurysm.","replies":[{"poster":"Tele","date":"2018-04-28T10:04:33.605+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey JustJohn,\n\nYeah that sounds pretty annoying :( Hopefully we can get you back in game soon though.\n\nTry these for me in order, and if none of them work then get back to me and I'll escalate your case:\n\n+ Enable low spec mode in settings, and then see if you can ban champions in a custom game. Make sure you're not running a bunch of stuff in the background (e.g youtube videos) and make sure you're not in a call.\n\n\n+ Keep low spec mode enabled and disable sound in settings. Enter into a custom game again to see if you can ban champions. \n\n\n+ If that doesn't work, then try a re-patch.
