If it&#039;s not going to be removed we should atleast be able to mute the enemy&#039;s champion emotes. We can&#039;t even block people without adding them first on this new client.  Riot PLEASE.  Can you get your shit together please?  Honestly, champion mastery was such a dumb idea. Maybe it wouldn&#039;t be so bad on a server that isn&#039;t as toxic as OCE but I&#039;m just sick of it.  I doubt riot even cares because people have been complaining about toxic players not being punished and don&#039;t seem to care.","replies":[{"poster":"Meteoric","date":"2016-12-02T06:11:02.645+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":1,"body":"if a tiny colored badge upsets you this much you probably dont have the emotional capacity to play this game anyway","replies":[{"poster":"nochillgamer","date":"2016-12-03T00:54:01.133+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Meteoric,realm=OCE,application-id=T8eq2lFQ,discussion-id=JlvjJZm7,comment-id=0004,timestamp=2016-12-02T06:11:02.645+0000)\n>\n> if a tiny colored badge upsets you this much you probably dont have the emotional capacity to play this game anyway\n\nLOL upvote","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Nijel","date":"2016-12-02T05:18:45.232+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I know that feel. Some people really do overuse that emote. Perhaps putting it on a longer cooldown might be a decent compromise to outright removing it. It's possible that some players might even give up on it if they can't get that instant gratification they seem to crave.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Talon12","date":"2016-12-02T04:28:38.877+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I've only ever seen people use it after making good plays, then again the sour puss's who lost to those plays become toxic and see it as toxic i guess.","replies":[]},{"poster":"nochillgamer","date":"2016-12-02T04:11:31.213+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"THrey don't care because their system take care of them.
