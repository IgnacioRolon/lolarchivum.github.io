But he stayed to try and get the Red Buff&#039;s little minions. RIP.

We were all tryharding to win a game and its really hard to do when someone is dc every 2 mins. She ended up sending some really really hateful stuff about me to the other guys through client (even to this day they wont tell me what she said about me). In the end she blocked me and as a direct result was banned from our flat and had no-one to play league with.","replies":[{"poster":"Amethystumn","date":"2016-02-13T06:15:56.304+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'm sorry to hear that!
