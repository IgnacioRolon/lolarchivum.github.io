All day today though my team has had two or three bot players on the team. When I am trying to play as ADC having NO support (no team mate in my lane at all) makes it hard to have a good start. With some pairs of opponent champs and my skill level it is near impossible. When I am trying to learn to Support having a suicidal ADC is almost as bad. I would honestly rather not play than play with bots on my team. How can this be avoided other than playing pvp which I don&#039;t think I&#039;m ready for?","replies":[{"poster":"LÃ©gs","date":"2016-08-14T14:07:32.305+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"To answer your question, this cannot be avoided. \n\nYour level 24 at the moment. I understand if you feel as if you aren't ready for PVP yet, honestly I don't think anyone ever feels like they are ready when they are still learning the game in bots, but you have to realise that bot games will not properly train you for normals, as you are only adjusting to bot behaviour and not human behaviour, and believe me, they are very distinct.\n\nNormals, although a bit scary at first, will not only be a surefire way to improve your gameplay, but you will find that the game is just more satisfactory overall, and trust me, it will only take a couple of games before you get used to it. The more you waste time on bots, the tougher your opponents will be on normals.","replies":[]},{"poster":"SephirothSG","date":"2016-08-13T04:14:42.626+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey there,\n\nUnfortunately while you are unable to avoid running into these players on occasion, you can help the fight against them :)\n\nPlease report these bots that you encounter in the end-game screen under \"Cheating\", please be as descriptive as possible in your report as to what they were doing in the game to make you suspect them of being bots.","replies":[]}]}
