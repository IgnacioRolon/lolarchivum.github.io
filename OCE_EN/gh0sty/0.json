I personally prefer it because of two main things;\r\n1. Less pressure\r\n2. Less trolls\r\n\r\nI tend to find I do better preseason than during, (notably this one too going from b3 to s3 in a month).\r\nDuring Last season I was silver V and ended up seeding to B3. I got to Silver promos 5 times during the year, each time losing and dropping all the way to B3 again, due to - trolls, afks, people being bad (including me - not everyone has a good game all the time) and a ton of (i guess) anxiety about the rank match because of the affor mentioned issues.\r\n\r\nHowever post season, I see less afk&#039;s, less trolls and I have a generally calming sense of &quot;it&#039;s ok&quot;.  I also find that preseason I can pick champs that will be strong in that meta before they&#039;re banned all the time and get easy wins. I&#039;m not too sure how it impacts seeding for next season, but it certainly makes ranking much easier albeit without any perks of shiny borders and pretty skins.\r\n\r\nWhats you thoughts?","replies":[{"poster":"WhiteKimchi","date":"2015-12-12T01:57:44.998+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I find the complete opposite..No one really cares about their rank so pretty much every game has a troll. There's lots of people who got boosted for end of season rewards and everyone is adjusting to pretty massive patches so overall quality goes down. Much more of a lottery than normal season.","replies":[]},{"poster":"choclatethunder","date":"2015-12-11T05:33:07.505+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Elo inflation. Everyone is going up, everyones elo artificially inflates during pre-season.\n\nThen when actual season starts the true Elo system is put in place and everyone will get a reality check as they are brought back down where they belong.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Orange Caramel","date":"2015-12-17T21:37:45.245+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"No, people afk and feed because it's preseason.","replies":[]}]}
