However every time I get into/near promos the same thing happens.  I go on some massive losing streak, and end up in like Bronze 3 and I have to climb back up all over again.  I generally duo with my mate Subdue666, so you&#039;ll see his name in a lot of my games (he is currently b3). \n\nNow I know I&#039;m not the best player by far, but I know that I generally do well in my chosen lane.  I can play all roles except ADC.  I don&#039;t have the skill or mechanics for that.  Now very often when I&#039;m losing lane, I can see it happening (or about to happen) so I ask for a gank or two to try help me get ahead.  This is generally never done, because I haven&#039;t poked them down or because &quot;they&#039;re fed&quot; even though they&#039;re only 1 or 2 kills in.  On the other hand if I&#039;m doing extremely well, which is usually the case when Subdue and I duo bot lane we get 4 man ganked every 3 minutes and our team refuses to either a) help defend the turret or b) push their turret.\n\nNow, I&#039;m not complaining the team is bad entirely.  For example when subdue and I were playing bot we got double kill in the first 7 minutes or so bot lane, and then we started getting camped by mid {{champion:76}} .  Our {{champion:99}}  at the time was doing extremely well smashing her lane too. However when {{champion:76}} ganked there was no mia and we were warded up but a {{champion:76}} q is quite a long hit and we were well into our fight.    {{champion:99}} then never took turret or came bot to ulti for a double kill.  Eventually we lost this game due to not capitalizing on the roams.  In another case our {{champion:38}} refused to roam, when his mid lane roamed to every lane every 2 minutes.\n\nI would like to know a few things.  What is the best thing to do in these situations?  How can I get mid to either roam, mia or push turrets to at least counter the issue?  What would be beneficial if I was top or jng in these situations? Should i relinquish my farm/turret to help other push their lanes? should I attempt a lane swap? What would be the best way to address the issues occurring?\n\nI found a really good site that can show you play by play as well if you want to take a look at what has happened and the mistakes I made during these games (it is linked already - just make sure you search under oce).  Just search my history if you feel the need.\n\nRemember even though I&#039;m pointing out that they have made mistakes, I am wanting to know how I can improve to fix them,..  I already know where my mistakes lie and where to improve.  But not how to handle situations like the above.","replies":[{"poster":"Bibimbap","date":"2015-10-02T10:28:15.660+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Map awareness, learn to dodge skillshots!
