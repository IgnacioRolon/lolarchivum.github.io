This is because Garena and Riot are separate companies. So every time someone wants to switch region, they have to sell that users information to Riot, and go through the legal international trade and business procedures. Not to mention special tax codes for this kind of business.\n\nThat's why they can only really do it for a limited time, it's just too much of a hassle. \n\n**There is a solution to your problem though, it will cost more than usual, but it's possible;**\n\n1. The new Japanese server is opening sometime in the next 2 months. It's likely that they will allow for free transfers from Garena to Japan, for a few months following the release of the Japanese server.\n\n2. Once your account has been transferred to Japan you will be able to transfer to any other region, including OCE. This is because the Japanese server will be owned by Riot.\n\nYou'll pay the transfer fee twice, but it's currently the only way. Feel free to reply in you're confused about anything.","replies":[{"poster":"Er√∏se","date":"2016-01-09T22:28:21.463+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It's probably free to transfer from Garena To Japan but you would have to pay for japan to oceania","replies":[]}]}]}
