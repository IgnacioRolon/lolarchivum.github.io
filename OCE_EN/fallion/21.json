Most tanky supports are melee and normally takes {{item:3302}} as their starting item. Even Thresh starts with a relic shield. For item build it depends on which tanky champion you are playing. Most of the time you will get {{item:2049}} first, then complete shoe of your choice and upgrade relic shield to a {{item:3401}}. An example full build will be {{item:3401}} {{item:2049}}{{item:3009}} {{item:3190}} {{item:3110}} {{item:3075}} . An important tip is that do not build a {{item:3117}} if you have {{item:3068}} because when you get close to a minion it the aoe burn will disable the boots passive. When playing taric you might want to get {{item:3025}} somewhere in your build. For runes get movespeed quints or Armor quints, Armor marks, Armor yellows and MR Blue. For masteries get bond of stone as your keystone mastery or you can take Thunderlords if your champion have some good burst damage.\n\nOther than that you can check for builds at champion.gg. Just remember to not get {{item:3117}} if you have {{item:3068}}. Also for some unknown reason {{item:3050}} is rarely seen as part of the builds found on champion.gg . I build Zeke's on every support champion i play and it is an extremely good item.","replies":[]},{"poster":"voidscythe","date":"2016-01-21T13:05:34.413+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"If you don't know who to play, just try more supports, you'll find one that you like. You can check the Tier Lists to help you decide (http://www.nerfplz.com/) .Once you've found that champion, hop onto YouTube and watch pro streams, they really really help!! Then browse around for builds on the internet, I like using Mobafire (http://www.mobafire.com/). \n\nA big tip for supports is make sure you zone your opponents, but don't overextend and get yourself killed. What that means, is that try to threaten the other ADC and make them scared, make them wary of you. They'll generally start losing xp and farm trying to not get caught out. While you zone, just watch for when the enemy ADC walks a little too far, trying to get that extra minion far away. Thats your chance to strike and hopefully kill them. An example of this is Blitzcrank. Stay close to the edge of a minion wave, and threaten the enemy ADC, if they walk too far, they'll get pulled. Just make sure while your zoning, you don't stray too far from your ADC and make sure to ward up!\n\nGood luck on the Rift!!","replies":[]},{"poster":"Brucey","date":"2016-01-21T12:44:45.445+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Leona, Braum would be your \"Tank\" supports if ahead then late game your going to be unkillable. Mainly want to go normal mountain, warding stone thing, if a lot of mr or someone ap bursty say a annie or lb go Locket, Leona want to go either deadmans or frozen heart on braum want to either go warmogs for the q damage and tanky or randuins then what ever left over its up to you if you need more amour go randuins, thornmail or sun fire if you need more mr get visage or banshees. If you are fine with tanky then get zekes very good right now.\n\nWith these 2 champions all you wanna do is either if you are behind protect and peel your adc in lane, if you are ahead go aggressive try to get more kills so you and the adc can carry I've had many times with leona where i could carry the team with perfect ults :) \n","replies":[]}]}
