Maybe gems for his hammer, armour and shield that effect his basic abilities?\n\nDepending on what happens with Poppy I'm thinking he might even lose the shield. Unlikely I know but I just have this feeling that having two Hammer/Shield champions being redone and rereleased within months of each other seems a bit too similar.\n\nThat being said, A single hammer might encroach on Jayce's space.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Slycandicem","date":"2015-08-17T15:19:43.599+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"tarics stun cd is just a bit too long when you look at the cd of similar abilities like leona's q, morg q, braum q etc. I have enjoyed playing taric in the past but he doesnt feel very strong now. His ult is a bit meh too when you look at other support type ults. \n\nA rework would be good. The recent 'buff' has helped a little but compared to a few other champs in support role it is hard to find a place for him in a team.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Ediwir","date":"2015-08-17T10:27:07.951+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Taric is currently getting a full rework: gameplay, model, graphics, audio, background. Think Sion to get an idea of how big it's going to be. The concept of \"Support Paladin\" is staying, but they'll have to work on what gem magic means in LoL. It's however not in such a bad state that it becomes urgent, therefore we shouldn't expect anything until the end of the year.\n\nSource: various rito posts that i read being a Taric main but i don't feel like finding after a whole monday.","replies":[]},{"poster":"TrashDonnut","date":"2015-08-17T08:35:03.555+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'm pretty sure there was a post on Reddit, (i'm not too sure) but it was from the end of this year to next year.","replies":[]},{"poster":"LÃ©gs","date":"2015-08-17T08:03:34.308+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"All I know is Riot knows {{champion:44}} could do with some love.
