Janna can benefit from AP but for her main job of **peel** it's not critical. Scaling MP5 Quints are strong enough that I don't need to focus on mana items. The 50% or 100% increases on mana regen from her standard items are sufficient. \n\nI usually avoid scaling runes on supports, but the MP5s scale fast enough that they work. By level 5 they're about as good, and better from level 6 onwards.","replies":[]},{"poster":"CatchTheseHands","date":"2016-01-11T01:42:43.229+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I have been using Flat Armour marks seals and quints with scaling MR glyphs with leona, that coupled with her W makes her an early game moving titanium wall that stuns and roots. very effective I have found, give it a go.","replies":[]},{"poster":"BarryButcher","date":"2016-01-10T04:56:03.883+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Marks - Armour or Hybrid Pen\nSeals - HP or Armour\nGlyphs - MR or AP\nQuints - Armour, AP or Movespeed\n\nDepends on your playstyle.\n\nI personally run.\nMarks: Hybrid Pen\nSeals: 5 HP 4 Armour\nGlyphs: AP\nQuints: 2 Armour 1 AP\n\nNo MR but gives 40HP 13 Armour and 16 AP which is comparable to what an AP midlaner starts with.\n\nIn my opinion you NEVER want to take scaling runes on a support because in 99% of games you are going to be the lowest level and it takes you a long time to get the real advantage of scaling runes. Also bottom lane is very focused on early game power, so you need the flat stats for the level 2-3 all ins thats usually come.\n\nAs a support you usually build a lot of CDR and Mana regen and I hate going over the cdr cap. Doesnt sit right in my head. Most the champs you said start {{item:3303}}  so you will be getting mana regen and cdr pretty early on with a {{item:3092}}","replies":[]},{"poster":"Brucey","date":"2016-01-10T04:24:15.247+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"There are many different runes for those champions what i use is. \nEither Magic Pen or Hybrid Pen or even Amour - Reds \n\nEither HP per lvl or Amour - Yellows Depending on your choice i prefer hp per lvl for that little more hp your not going to get cause your building things that don't give you health so your Zekes (You get armour from this), frost queens etc. \n\nBlues are kinda your choice if you like that little bit extra sustain on those heal abilities say janna's e or nami's w you def run ap blues or if you are vs a high ap lane say a corki + a ap lane bully (Lux, Annie, Sona) then go mr blues \n\nQuints you would again your choice and depending on lane would run either Movementspeed or ap quints i've been trying out hp runes on janna, sona and they don't work out that well\n\nThis is all probably confusing but if you want more tanky/sustain lane \nMagc pen - reds\nHp per lvl - yellows\nMR - Blues\nAP - Quints\n\nIf you want more of a damage lane if your with say a Graves, Corki, Lucain go\nMagc pen or Hybrid pen depending on sona i would go hybrid rest i would go magic pen - reds\nHp or hp per lvl your choice - Yellows\nAP - Blues\nAP - Quints \n\nPS. you get that mana regen mastery and once late game you get a lot of mana regen items so theres no point running mana regen runes its a waste with what other runes give as well. \n\nHope this helps as i play a lot of support. (One of those guys that fill and get support but i like getting carried)\n\n(Forgot you had karma there here is runes for her as she is really different to the rest of them\nMagic pen - reds\nAmour or hp - yellows \nMagic pen Blues or AP blues your choice her base damage and with her mantra q it deals a lot of damage so running Magic pen blues would increase that damage as well \nAP - Quints \nAs i said she is different as her base scaling on damage abilities are higher and you build more aggressive then the other champions you put on the list so this would A. let you deal more damage and B. give you enough ap for the early game shielding. And you want to poke as much as you can with karma, these runes work with Zyra and Annie too really well) ","replies":[{"poster":"Fallion","date":"2016-01-10T04:34:46.705+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"thank you so much ! that helps alot and it can help other support players too.\nI really appreciate your strategy.","replies":[]}]}]}
