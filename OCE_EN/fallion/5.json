I'm at the bottom in Bronze and at that level I feel you want to **back **on around **900 gold **and take **second tier of your gold item**and **first tier of your essential item**. For Janna that is Nomad's Medallion and Amplifying Tome. But for Lux that is Frostfang and Ampifying Tome. So it varies a bit.\n\nTaking Sightstone puts you back in lane a little weaker and I think you don't need it until the roaming phase after a tower is down: your trinket will serve until then. Taking boots depends on how much pressure you are under for maintaining distance, or if you think you can roam. Scaling items like Dark Seal I think depend on if you are already ahead. If you are under a lot of pressure, maybe Doran's is right.","replies":[]},{"poster":"SorakaXHealBoT","date":"2016-01-11T06:13:57.270+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Frost queen claim first then get a sightstone.

Also helps set up ganks and roams with your jungler.\n\nthe earlier you get it generally the better.\n\nafter that, I honestly dont build much more ap unless im super fed. sight stone cdr and tank will generally be the best bet.\n\nCheers","replies":[]},{"poster":"Sailor Jupiter","date":"2016-01-10T11:13:55.472+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It varies depending on how the lane is going and if there's jungle pressure.\nIf the enemy team has something like a Warwick jungle I know I don't really have to worry about ganks, so vision control in the river is less important. In this situation I'd buy the upgraded support item first, then boots, then a Sightstone.\nIf there is going to be jungle pressure in your lane then a Sightstone is a much more important first item buy.\nAnother thing to consider is if you are poking a lot in lane and making full use of the gold gen on Spellthief's. If so upgrading it can be a boon.\nIf you're trading health in lane more, then maybe the extra health from a Sightstone would be more use to help you outlast your opponents.\n\nThis was maybe too convoluted an answer, but I hope it helped you think about it in a way you wouldn't have otherwise :)","replies":[]},{"poster":"Yasei Doubutsu","date":"2016-01-10T09:37:56.034+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Get your first support item, I.E Shield or Frost queen etc.\nI usually rush a sightsotn after that as its 800 Gold that grants HP.\n\nThen when I can I merge the two items together.","replies":[]},{"poster":"DarkenedKnight","date":"2016-01-10T06:59:49.484+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I always change how i build, I either build Sightstone first or ill buy the upgraded tier of the supp item  {{item:3098}} with a vision ward and then ill rush a sightstone before completing {{item:3092}} \n\nEspecially if you're running {{item:3301}}  The upgraded one gives more Health and gold per minion death {{item:3096}}","replies":[]},{"poster":"CHEESYLEEKS","date":"2016-01-10T06:56:44.743+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":2,"body":"Buy some tanky supports.\n\nwhen i play sona {{item:3303}} is an awesome item i wouldnt suggest anything else first back i usually get {{item:1028}} +{{item:1001}} +{{item:1004}} \n\n2nd back depending on the situation ill get {{item:2049}} +{{item:3098}}  and possibly {{item:3158}} \n\nthen i rush {{item:3092}}  and turn the sightstone into {{item:2045}} \n\nafter that i take a sheen and eventually build a lichbane. after that i would build a rylais.\n\n{{item:3092}} {{item:3158}} {{item:2045}} {{item:3100}} {{item:3116}}  last item is up to you.","replies":[]}]}
