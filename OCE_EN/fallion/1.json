It depends on how aggressive your playstyle is. \n\nIf you're playing into a Leona Corki lane (or high burst magic damage in general) Id definitely be running magic resist.\n\nHowever if you're laning against someone without high kill potential on you, mana regen will win out as you can out poke and sustain on these champs. \n\nHope this helps!","replies":[]},{"poster":"Tweak","date":"2016-04-14T00:48:46.541+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"At the end of the day, your play-style will determine what you should have on your rune pages and masteries.\n\nIf you like spamming spells and think you need mana regen, then build mana regen. \n\nYou need to also keep in mind that when people discuss what LCS players or Challenger/Diamond players do, that their opponents play very differently from solo queue. Solo queue has it's own set of tactics and skills. So if an LCS player takes mana regen runes, it doesn't mean it's the best option for you.\n\nIn summary, trying and failing is the best way to perfect your rune pages to your needs.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Olee","date":"2016-04-13T23:12:34.885+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I don't run it, but you can if you want to.
