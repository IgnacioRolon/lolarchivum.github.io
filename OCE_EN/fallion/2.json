This is always occurring and balancing itself. If this MMR is above or below your current rank then your LP gains will change relative to the difference. There is no way to find your exact MMR, but understanding the concept should help you to grasp exactly why the system is acting the way it does. \n\nEssentially MMR always changes, LP doesn't. If your MMR exceeds the average for your rank then you'll see higher LP gains and lower losses and vice versa when your MMR is lower.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Aidan7787","date":"2016-06-19T04:54:32.778+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"So MMR is match making ranking in which they determine game so both teams have a near equal MMR. The problem is yours is much lower then Silver 1 as shown by the last game you played which was Silver4 S4 S4 S5 S1 on your team. and S2 S2 S3 S3 and B1 on the other team. So you are probably trying to get you back to silver 3/4ish which is about the standard which you are currently playing with.

If your mmr is deemed to be lower than the division you're in you will lose more than you gain because it's trying to get you where it believes you belong\n\nYou have a good win rate at 55% this season, do you duo a lot of games or party up because I think that can have an effect on LP gains losses too.

Just like chess, if you are playing against players of lower MMR, then you are expected to beat them, so your MMR gains are lower. Conversely, if you beat players of higher MMR, your MMR will rise at a higher rate. \n\nLP gains/losses is based on your MMR compared to the average MMR at your rank.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Oprah Windfurry","date":"2016-06-18T09:46:19.659+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Fallion,realm=OCE,application-id=FjGAIbRv,discussion-id=BAxmmkhq,comment-id=00000000,timestamp=2016-06-18T09:38:24.236+0000)\n>\n> whats MMR\n\nshort answer I don't really know and riot doesn't disclose what your mmr is. If you look at op.gg they can approximate it for you., they say yours is 1297 and average for your division is 1392 they say it will continue to tank until it improves. \nAgain I don't really know and there will be wiser heads out there than mine. I would've thought at 55% win rate your gains would exceed your losses but maybe if you duo or party up that can have a negative effect.","replies":[{"poster":"Fallion","date":"2016-06-18T11:06:32.888+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"thank you for explaining it :)","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}
