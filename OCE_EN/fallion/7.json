Great attitude, but not true. If you won a hard counter match-up it's because you had more skill on your champion than the opponent. \n\nA great example is the famous [\"TF Jungle game\"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g7l30-4A6WQ) at 2014 IEM San Jose. Bjergsen (the best mid-laner at the tournament) was counter picked by a lesser mid-laner at the time, PowerOfEvil. There was nothing Bjergsen could do to win really, his jungle could have helped, but Bjergsen himself was very limited in that game.\n\nThe real best counter is to not pick Lux into Yasuo. Lux is good, but she is a risky blind pick, other champions such as {{champion:4}} TF and {{champion:238}} Zed are much safer blind picks.\n\n**But if you do get unlucky, you can try this:**\n\n1.  {{champion:99}} Lux vs {{champion:157}} Yasuo is a really tough match up for Lux. If you're a god level Lux, then bait the windwall and predict the E juke. If not, then either push like crazy, or cs under turret (other option better). \n\n2. Your roams can be stronger than Yasuo because you have CC. So as long as you're not behind, roaming will be your best bet to stay ahead. \n\n3. Get your jungler to help early levels as much as possible, levels 1 - 4 are the most dangerous, after that pushing the wave in is easier. \n4. Make sure you have a defensive second summoner spell. {{summoner:7}} Heal or {{summoner:3}} Exhaust (heal better IMO).","replies":[]}]}
