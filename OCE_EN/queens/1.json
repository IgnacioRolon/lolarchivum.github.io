The problem is you don't burst people that hard and it'a very upclose and person build since you need to be in range to use the triforce aa buff. This build works extremely well with fervor of battle or grasp of undying. Going either 18-0-12 or 12-0-18. This build is really strong at just fighting because you're somewhere between a toplane bruiser and a caster adc.\n\nIf you feel the game might take a while to ramp up then a more armour pen build is great for just bursting people down though and with this much armour pen\n{{item:1412}} {{item:3142}} {{item:3147}} {{item:3156}} {{item:3071}} {{item:3006}} \nwith this build you just burst people down so fast and so you'll want 18-0-12 with warlords bloodlust and the lifesteal from maw allowing you to act kinda like an ad assassin and your ult does crazy amounts of damage.","replies":[{"poster":"Queens","date":"2016-09-15T07:11:08.328+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thanks","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"lukepantha","date":"2016-09-15T03:40:09.732+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I personally like to go either 70 or 100% crit with deaths dance as he one shots people with it\nThe main problem with this build is that its a late game build and slows you down a lot","replies":[]},{"poster":"CHEESYLEEKS","date":"2016-09-14T19:54:20.213+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Sabre,ghost blade and duskblade i would say are essential","replies":[]}]}
