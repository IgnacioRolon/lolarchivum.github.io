He can mid, top, adc or jg. That means you can actually build a functioning team comp. He's also kinda of strong though he is awkward to use for anyone who's never played casseopia. Compare urgot to say nunu who is basically only a jungler or maybe a toplaner if you're experienced with him; or janna who can pretty much only go support.","replies":[{"poster":"Nightjar","date":"2016-08-19T10:33:31.466+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Also the 5 stars of nemisis draft are known for their unique and difficult to pull off kits, weak early game (although zilean has some pretty decent early poke), poor 1v1 duelling power, low burst potential and predicatable gamestyles. Urgot is not too difficult to pull off to some degree (an inexperienced nunu is useless even though his kit is point and click) and he's got a strong early and midgame, medium burst and somewhat hard to predict gamestyle because his kit does the same thing, his build varies, which lane he is and avoiding the homing q's is all kinda hard to play around.","replies":[{"poster":"Nightjar","date":"2016-08-19T10:42:00.023+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Also janna is not good in nemisis draft without an atk speed or adc pick and she doesn't exactly synergise with yorrick or any of the other 5 stars of nemisis draft, not to mention that only support mains will likely know how to play janna really well especially without being able to abuse her e since she won't have a proper adc; and support mains are not exactly thoroughfare.","replies":[{"poster":"Sloth Almighty","date":"2016-08-19T11:20:30.725+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Haha I've played 1 game of nem draft and I actually got yorrick and went bot with janna.
