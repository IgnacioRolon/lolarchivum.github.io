I studied the fish like a good book, one page at a time. His abilities are relatively easy to read, he's fairly immobile (imo) and yeah he does damage but hey, which AP mid doesn't do damage hehe xD? I will accept him, as I believe the term 'Fish are Friends, not food' fits perfectly well into this debate/opinion/rant/\"Fuck Fizz\". I hope you all have a wonderful day, onwards and upwards. {{champion:105}}","replies":[]},{"poster":"Garens Harem","date":"2016-02-19T12:44:00.526+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"fish","replies":[]},{"poster":"Darthski","date":"2016-02-18T23:32:45.722+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Play Ryze.
