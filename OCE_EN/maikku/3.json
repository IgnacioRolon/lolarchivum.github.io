LOVE YOU!)","subforum":"Player Creations","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Riot has a plethora of incredible music from login screens over the years, and the in-game music doesn&#039;t change much--let alone summoners having the option to change it. That changed with the addition of DJ Sona. Now, I&#039;m sure that was a huge undertaking getting the music options in game (maybe? idk, I&#039;m not a programmer). But you&#039;re Riot. Giving back to everyone--summoners and Rioters alike--is what you do best. (Seriously, thanks for all your hard work, Rioters =P )\r\nI would PAY MONEY for the ability to change music to any song from Riot&#039;s music archive. DJ Sona would maintain her uniqueness in that she would retain the tracks originally written for her in addition to Riot&#039;s music archive.\r\nI know that, yes, I could just turn off in-game music and turn on my Spotify to whatever song I want, but I LOVE the ability to have in-game music...well, in-game.\r\n\r\nI&#039;m not a coder, so idk how difficult this would be, but maybe you can use whatever code was used for DJ Sona and just move the play button to the top of the Tab screen. That way, DJ Sona would still have her play button, and clicking on either play button would override the current music. \r\n\r\nBut finally, I don&#039;t know how much more of a load it would be on your servers. So I don&#039;t know the limitations of this idea, or even if it even disallows for it on many servers. But then, if it was another paid transaction, that would likely limit its usage. I would be glad to discuss this with anyone and everyone, and I appreciate you reading this. Cheers!\r\n\r\n-Mike","replies":[{"poster":"Glow","date":"2016-08-26T20:43:45.924+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"That's a pretty cool idea, I wonder if it would detract from the game experience at all (with people standing round choosing songs etc).
