Close to mid-ranged skill shots are now much easier to dodge thanks to MS updates on the map, nearly rendering skill-shots ineffective in this mode. This is bad for champs like Orianna, a short-ranged/yet ranged champion with no gap closer who did not receive any benefit that melee champs received yet relies on kiting with skill-shots. Additionally, I find the movement speed makes it easier for the team stacked in CC to kite, creating an incredibly unenjoyable experience.\n\nI fully appreciate the need for the movement speed updates, as super-distance poke champs will almost always win the game....but there must be a way to remember the middle guy. =(","replies":[]}
