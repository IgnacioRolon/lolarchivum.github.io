It&#039;s been proven time and time again that positive reinforcement does so much more to change behavior than negative reinforcements or punishments alone. Summoners being reformed should be told when they&#039;re doing better, when they&#039;re no longer placed in queue with the other temporary deplorables. Being told you&#039;re doing better seems incredibly simple, but it goes a long way with people who are actually trying to change their behavior. \r\n\r\nWith this, you could even go so far as to add a &quot;positive queue&quot; for people who are honored more. I&#039;m sure plenty of people have suggested skins or champs for people who are showing positive behavior, and I think that&#039;s a good idea as well. I mean, yeah, there&#039;s the potential loss in sales, but I feel like Riot values game-play more than losing a few thousand dollars a year in potential sales of a specific skin (maybe skins could be made for this purpose?), especially when it could draw more people back to the game who have quit because player behavior is an issue for them (I know it&#039;s a major reason why I stay away from summoner&#039;s rift).\r\n\r\nI really would love to see something positive to effect positive behavior in summoners. I would love to see a better community.

Report is just a flag, its numbers doesn't get people banned by itself. What gets people banned is being determined that the report(s) is valid. And it also usually take a couple valid offences in a time frame to receive punishment unless the said offence is severe in 1 go; most of the time it does take effort to really be banned, it's not something that's just handed out on a whim.","replies":[{"poster":"Call Me Clouds","date":"2017-02-14T11:21:17.322+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":3,"body":"lmao no","replies":[{"poster":"SEKAI","date":"2017-02-14T11:23:23.650+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Call Me Clouds,realm=OCE,application-id=T8eq2lFQ,discussion-id=KEuVqtRG,comment-id=000500000000,timestamp=2017-02-14T11:21:17.322+0000)\n>\n> lmao no\n\nYeah okay.","replies":[{"poster":"Call Me Clouds","date":"2017-02-14T11:26:42.307+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":3,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=SEKAI,realm=OCE,application-id=T8eq2lFQ,discussion-id=KEuVqtRG,comment-id=0005000000000000,timestamp=2017-02-14T11:23:23.650+0000)\n>\n> Yeah okay.\n\nI've seen it happen on multiple occasions, but ok, you're right","replies":[{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2017-02-14T16:28:34.397+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"What SEKAI says is true.
