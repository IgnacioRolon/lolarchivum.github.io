Please, have your team test games on a usd$1000 computer (2gb vram). $1000 is a lot of money to most people, yet it's barely enough to buy a gaming PC. League is intensive, of course. But its demand is great enough to warrant considerations for those of us who can't afford $2000-4000 for a gaming pc in the era of console gaming. \r\nBut alas, in-game isn't the worst when comparing it to the client, the most unpleasant experience of my life. I know it's been redesigned quite, but what can any of us peasants do to be able to actually enjoy firing up our second love that is League of Legends? Besides turning off all possible animations (done) is there anything we can do to decrease client lag (and even VLag in-game in the not-so-professional computers with 2gb dedicated vram)?","replies":[{"poster":"Broken Scripts","date":"2019-04-07T09:38:23.447+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You can play League on a $350 computer...","replies":[]},{"poster":"BRUSHED","date":"2019-04-07T07:07:06.169+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Go down to your local Cashies mate. guarantee that you can pick up an old gaming computer that will run league on mid to high graphics easy. usually for about $300 - $400.\nI upgraded doing this 5 times over the years. each time its worked out like a charm.\n\nif you are having issues with client lag might i suggest turning on the option that keeps the client open during gameplay. often enough the lag you are speaking of is the end screen load times. by having the client open during game play you negate the need for you computer to reload the client, and will have the end game screen up imeddiately.\nor if its to do with shop load times, its becuase of your internet speed which i mean what can you do.\n\nin game lag can be cuased by ram being taken up by other intrusivve programs that run in the background (looking at you steam) like macafee or windows defender. turning these off often ends up with lag ceasing to exist. check your icon tray for whats running weigh up wether or not you need it running and end its existance. \n\ni have a micro computer with 2 gbs of ram and no v ram that has a processing speed of 2.95gb/s on a dual core. it can run league without lag in low spec. if i turn on uncapped frame rate there are occasional jitters. the client itself can be ran with animations on this computer perfectly fine. ( cost $120 brand new)\njust make sure to run the client in the background of games, makes a huge difference between games.\nalso running the game in windowed mode reduces the time needed too tab between programs.\n\nim sure alot of this isnt helpful but i hope you find some nugget of help in there{{sticker:sg-ahri-2}}","replies":[]}]}
