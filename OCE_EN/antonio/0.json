Now don't get me wrong, I'm not here to say that Leaver Buster shouldn't be here but the people who have internet drops cannot help the issue. \nBeing disconnected from the game and coming back 1 hour later to see that you have a warning and have to type 'I Agree' as if you left on purpose is just stupid, the client should read through the past logs and see if the person actually left the game or were disconnected; that is if the logs actually show that information which I suspect it should. \nI'd imagine this would be some of the first thoughts come to mind while creating such a system but apparently not, this should be patched and fixed. People shouldn't be blamed for a black out or a DDOS, just saying.\nAny thoughts?","replies":[{"poster":"HORSE OF FORCE","date":"2015-01-11T00:42:46.047+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"That would be abused if it ever came out. People could just quit games by disconnecting their internet, and the game wouldn't ban them because it reads it as them getting \"disconnected\".\n\nIt's just unfortunate that you had a power outage while playing a game. :/","replies":[]}]}
