I picked up a new champ and dropped to Silver 3 from Silver 1. I started playing Mid Ezreal and for the most part do pretty well in lane and in late game, but I feel like AP Ezreal needs a pretty team dependent champ. \r\n\r\nI&#039;m dropping my AP Ezreal for now, I can get back up to S1 easily but I&#039;m seeing how important playing with competent team players are. \r\n\r\nI really would like to play with players that are calm and collected.","replies":[{"poster":"ItzMrStealYoBuff","date":"2016-10-25T22:36:59.944+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"How come posting in OCE boards? are you OCE?
