Just another pointless change that Riot made for the purposes of keeping their disorganised pool of staff busy which was neither beneficial nor novel for the community. Bring back forums.\n\nHere's a quotation from a notification I received months ago from Riot after one of my posts was removed:\n\n\"We want to keep the low content posts to a minimum, as there are a lot of people who use these boards regularly.\"\n\nAll I can say is LOL. This place is a ghost town compared with the forums of old. It was then, and it is now. Remove all the \"low content posts\" you like but without them there's no content at all. Face it, the transition to boards and a fascist moderation policy killed this community. It's the misc board of a video game, it's not supposed to be serious.","replies":[{"poster":"LemonHunter","date":"2015-05-22T04:05:35.071+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":2,"body":"Thanks for your constructive criticism, it was very insightful. Allow me to also offer my input on the matter. I'm assuming you would like to here some other people's thoughts as you didn't exactly ask any questions or utilise what boards are for, which is discussion.\n\nI for one like the boards, I just feel they should be implemented into the client for people to use from there. By implementing with the client, more of the player base with use the boards. I'm sure there are some people that either A) don't even know the boards exist or B) Don't realise that they just need to log in with their same account to start using it. Surprisingly it is common for people to not want to make an account on websites and it acts as a barrier of entry. If it is in client, you're already logged in and have a place to discuss things while waiting for games without needing to open any other programs.","replies":[{"poster":"Vote 1 Trump","date":"2015-05-22T04:15:05.175+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":4,"body":"Is this indicative of the calibre of discourse on boards? Yet another reason to bring back forums. I don't see a single rekt thread on the front page, there's no entertaining banter or rap battles, no forum personas or amusing alt accounts, no decent AMA threads. There's no creativity and nothing interesting left. RIP in pieces forums.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Sunlit Earth","date":"2015-05-22T05:36:28.346+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"What a load of bullshit. Only honesty I see in this thread is honest whinging. The old forums was clique-y, had just as much rubbish posted on it (such as this) than the boards has, if not more, and the only section of the forums with any significant activity was the general discussions. If anything, it was the forums that was dead. \n\nI think the greatest improvement the boards as made over the forums is there is such thing as a boards home. Creating a thread in the relevant board now has a chance of being seen and replied to.\n\nIf there's not enough \"entertaining\" threads or activity for you then either start posting them yourself or use the NA boards.","replies":[{"poster":"Vote 1 Trump","date":"2015-05-22T13:28:14.196+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Sunlit Earth,realm=OCE,application-id=Ntey9fRZ,discussion-id=09lNAo43,comment-id=0001,timestamp=2015-05-22T05:36:28.346+0000)\n>\n> \n> Creating a thread in the relevant board now has a chance of being seen and replied to.\n> \n\nYes, an extremely remote chance and if it is replied to it's usually just the driveling of a buttmad autist (cf. you)\n\nNow rap battle me or gtfo.","replies":[]}]}]}
