I go into a co-op vs AI game to do some build experimentation, only to immediately see that 2 of the other players are fucking lameass junglebots of the sort that have been INFESTING this game like a horde of plague rats for months, if not longer. Whatever, I think, just win it 3v5, it's still just bots. So we load up, and about 1 1/2 minutes into the game, Akali runs straight up mid lane and starts autoattacking the turret.\n\nOK, so it's not 3v5, it's 2v6- not only do we have 2 useless fucker bots that will do nothing except slowly and pointlessly take jungle camps until the camps start executing them, but we have a feedbot that's going to do nothing but make whichever enemy bot goes mid stronger. We're actually going to lose to the AI.\n\nSo obviously I leave that game, because fuck that shit. So now I'm unable to play until the game is over and my leaver penalty wears off. Because I didn't want to waste fuck knows how long slowly and painfully losing to AI because of the FUCKING BOTS that Riot won't do anything about. And that's assuming that _I_ don't end up getting my account automatically suspended by leaverbuster for quitting a fucking AI game infested by bots!\n\nEnough of this shit, Riot. You KNOW these people are out there. There's someone who is clearly selling a basic junglebot code which any asshole can use to farm up free accounts to sell, ruining the play experience for all the REAL players in the meantime. Even if it IS just in co-op vs AI that'd be bad enough, but I hear they're also ruining ARAM too (although I don't play ARAM myself).\n\nPull your damn fingers out and stop these fucknuts from _ruining your damn game!_","replies":[{"poster":"Dr Clarence","date":"2018-01-01T19:47:14.916+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"I hope this has made you feel better.\n\nSimple way to get around the bots.
