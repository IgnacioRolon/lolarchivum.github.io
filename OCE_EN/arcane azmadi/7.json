I figured it would be a remake, but at 3:00 I tried and was told that &quot;You can only remake when a member of your team has disconnected&quot; (spoiler: one was). Figuring maybe the timer had been thrown off by game start time being moved forward 10 seconds (somehow) I tried again several times over the next 20 seconds, only to get the same message. Lee Sin actually reconnected to the game at EXACTLY 3:25, well past the cut-off point for a remake (and late enough to put him at a CONSIDERABLE disadvantage against the enemy jungler, who invaded and killed him at 6 minutes in thanks to a 2-level advantage).\n\nFortunately my team managed to recover from a bad early game and win, but it could very easily have gone much worse, and the fact that we won doesn&#039;t change the fact that we should have been able to remake and weren&#039;t. There had been no first blood until afterwards either; I'd made a point of keeping track. Has remake simply been disabled or is it bugged?","replies":[]}
