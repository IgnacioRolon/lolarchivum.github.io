Well, I've worked out that it's back again, only now it's worse: they're specifically targeting people and actively fucking up their client.\r\n\r\nTwice now in a matter of days I've had lobbies where I got into a disagreement with other players in it, only for me to be unable to load into the subsequent game (the game client doesn't even START) and subsequently be branded a leaver and score an auto loss (in ranked) when the game is remade. It just happened right then, after our midlaner told me \"you're gonna regret this\" in the lobby. I dunno what he did, but the timing is too perfect for it to be a coincidence. After the first time (which crippled my client, I couldn't even get into fresh games) my client installed a small patch which fixed everything, only for this to happen AGAIN.\r\n\r\nI'm positive the asshole in the lobby did something to fuck me up as petty spiteful revenge. Because the alternative is that Riot's fucking client is a complete piece of shit which breaks itself on a near-daily basis.","replies":[]}
