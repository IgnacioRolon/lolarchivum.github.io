He needs to be able to effectively coordinate with his team due to his bad roaming because of a lack of wave clear, roaming assassins and being 100-0 by an Assasin like Fizz is (if you aren't cautious) is his biggest downfall. If you can survive and get some items (RoA, Zhonyas, Sorcs, D cap) you should be fairly set. \nIf they don't try to 100-0 you with jungler and let you harass, you should be fairly safe, unless they are using fizz or something.","replies":[{"poster":"daveeyx","date":"2015-01-04T07:39:30.284+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"This basically covers it all. Talon carries insanely hard at low elo, especially since most games are decided during the laning phase and mid game. If you see a Talon in bronze/silver, they almost always carry the game. Swain's a better pick at high elo imo, but that's dependent that you get the support from your team and they know what they are doing - more of a situational pick.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Chalze","date":"2015-01-04T03:36:38.820+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Swain has shtty wave clear as Dota2 said, and Talon does have better wave clear (needs 1 ability to wipe out a wave) but that's not the only thing you should consider...\n\nTalon can insta burst champions but Swain is a beast in extended team fights...plus, Swain's damage has got slightly higher scalings than average across the AP casters and he has some nice CC which will help your jungler gank you.
