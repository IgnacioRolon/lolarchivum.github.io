Riot, there has to be more you can do?\nStill something has to be done about this, I just want this game to end so I can report them x-x\n\nEDIT: Finally ended. That was the longest 15min of my life. All 4 had heal, one had ghost and the rest had barrier. Two didn't seem as inclined to kill themselves than the others, Jhin and GP were dancing under towers tho, the Lulu hung back under bot tower and Brand just sort of wandered around. It's clear that they're using different programs to see what works but seriously something has to be done. Even if it envolves IP bans, just something to shut them down for good.\n\nEDIT 2: They all accepted and locked in pretty fast so I'm guessing they're all from the same place, maybe even partied up together.","replies":[{"poster":"fattyhotdogs","date":"2016-03-01T07:08:04.255+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Every time i see a 'wahh bots' thread, i wonder about any new players that people mistake for bots","replies":[{"poster":"CHEESYLEEKS","date":"2016-03-01T07:16:25.045+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I had this happen once, had an azir that played like a bot, me and the rest of the team tried to talk to him with no response so assumed bot, got to end chat and he said 'azir is hard'.... felt kinda bad","replies":[{"poster":"Crimsonknight90","date":"2017-05-23T03:43:12.226+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"lol what for ? he was obviously trolling.
