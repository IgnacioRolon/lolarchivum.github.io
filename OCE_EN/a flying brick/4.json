We&#039;ve been encountering some players that are cleary using a bot program. It&#039;s really annoying since they will just roam from lane to lane, go to the various jungle camps and so on or just walk circles around the base.\r\nFrom what we can tell it&#039;s someone&#039;s farming program for either IP or the referal program since we&#039;ve seen a good few of them and they make the game go for a good 10-15 min longer than it should as well as make it a pain to teach since every once in a while the underleveled bot comes in and feeds.\r\nSince it&#039;s only bots we can survive the 4v5 but it really kills the spirit of the game for some dick to get a free ride really annoys us both.\r\n\r\nWe&#039;ve been reporting them for feeding each time since that&#039;s the closest to what happened but since they don&#039;t really die that much it doesn&#039;t make much sense since there&#039;s no option to report for using a bot or something like that. \r\nAside from that is there anything else we can do besides reporting?","replies":[]}
