They literally went mid and fed and there was nothing we could do. Riot can you do something about this? I&#039;m getting super sick of this and they&#039;re in every game mode.","replies":[{"poster":"Wuks","date":"2015-12-16T23:29:41.150+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey A Flying Brick,\n\nThe use of scripts and third-party programs is against the Terms of Use, and is an offense worthy of suspension. The integrity of leveling up and playing games is very important to us, so these actions will not be tolerated. As such, be sure to report any instances of 3rd Party Application use to Riot Games Player Support so they can investigate the issue further. Thank you, and sorry that these bots are causing you a negative experience.","replies":[{"poster":"A Flying Brick","date":"2015-12-17T11:35:33.148+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I kinda know all that and I've been reporting every one of them I've come across and told my friends to do the same thing, but they're still in nearly every game we play (both bots and aram). We even have a mini game of sorts where we guess who the bots are pre-game, since they never talk and always pick a free week champ (usally a tank). And that's how bad it's gotten that we can, quite accuratly, pick them out since another tell is that they take forever to load in (most likely due to ping).\n\nAnd they do make the game literally unplayable, last night was the worst example of this since it was me as Poppy and my friend as Ahri with all three bots just running down mid and feeding.","replies":[]}]}]}
