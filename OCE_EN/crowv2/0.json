AUD vs NZD). In our case that value is determined by some deep economics stuff that I would have little hope of understanding let alone explaining, but back in the day that value was determined (primarily) by composition.\n\n1 'gold' with a gram of actual gold in it is going to be worth less than 1 'gold' with 5g of gold in it. Where the currency comes from would likely determines that. Of course they may well just use gold itself as the currency depending on how relatively abundant it is and how easy it is to trade.\n\nFollowing either precedent it makes sense for places renowned for less than savoury folk to have a form of currency that is easy to verify and difficult to counterfeit because otherwise it essentially has no value.\n\nBut trade being a valuable currency in it's own right, a place like Piltover using things like parts as a sort of secondary currency is not surprising, like how salt or silk were basically a currency of their own at some points in history.","replies":[]}]}]}
