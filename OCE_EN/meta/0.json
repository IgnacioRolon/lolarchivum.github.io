The only flaw was doubt, the doubt that a support would ever be picked. This led to a self perpetuating unpopularity because people would then use team builder and the doubt became true and nobody used it, thus leading players away from it. I have a suggestion for Riot. Use team builder where it matters more: Ranked Solo and Duo Queue. A large portion of the league of legends community plays ranked solo and duo queue, and a large portion of them lose because of fights started in champion select. These fights mean very little in a normal game because the loss doesn't really matter. However when 10-20 league points are at stake these fights can set players on tilt for the rest of the night because of one loss. I believe that by trialling team builder as the only option for ranked solo and duo queue for a week, people will see that the system works and we can change ranked for the better. \r\n\r\nOf course this system wouldn't work with the current team builder set up. Instead of having the player choose their role, then their champion and lane, the player could choose their role and lane and then proceed to have a draft mode champion select for picks/bans and actually selection of their champion. This would mean players would get their desired role, and usually their desired champion unless they had been picked or banned already, thus improving their gameplay and experience with minimal fights. But this is just my idea.","replies":[{"poster":"Justify","date":"2015-01-11T10:42:12.529+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"if they were to implement team builder into ranked solo queue/duo queue I think they should do a numbers system... \nFill out your best to worst roles 1 being your best 4th being your worst, and select 3-4 champions you may use for each role... \nYou will most likely get role 1 or 2, in rarer cases role 3. \nYou should never get a role 4, and support isn't included in the roles list. \nWhen you click accept 2 random players will be forced into the support role, they will have access to all support champions in the game, to use in ranked play only (champions like J4, Fizz, Vi, Zed, Pantheon will not be allowed when choosing a support as this may lead to trolling)\n\nIf a player verbally abuses another play in champion select there is a boot option, where it takes 3 votes for them to be sent back to searching for a game in ranked solo queue, no lp loss is given either to prevent abuse, upon entering champion select you are unable to visit search sites like lolking or op.gg to see what your allies are like, this is so you can't give out their lolking and show everyone in the lobby how trash they  are using that champion/role, or just in general.","replies":[{"poster":"Djia","date":"2015-01-12T13:53:09.552+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I like this numbers system idea however I disagree with being forced into a support role as there are many support mains who would then miss out on playing the role that they are best at.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Plottel","date":"2015-01-11T09:28:40.750+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I really like this idea! It would eliminate all the toxicity in champion select, and also mean that people could always play the role they're best at. Unfortunately I can see it running into the exact same issue as normal teambuilder - lack of supports.","replies":[]}]}
