The only other one used is the razer cortex program but that is used for ingame recording and increasing FPS counts. If increasing my fps due to my lower end machine than anyone overclocking or getting better hard ware is doing worse than I am.\r\n\r\nI have made a ticket but so far all they said was exactly what they said in the email. I can do and send whatever I have to to prove that I have NOT been cheating at this game. I have spent the last few years and over a thousand dollars on playing this game with my friends so I WANT my account back from this unjust ban","replies":[{"poster":"CHEESYLEEKS","date":"2017-02-12T23:16:54.158+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Ive seen tons of these on the na boards and they all have one thing in common. \n\nThey all used curse","replies":[{"poster":"Roguestoney","date":"2017-02-12T23:24:33.161+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Pretty sure ages ago they said curse is banned didn't they?
