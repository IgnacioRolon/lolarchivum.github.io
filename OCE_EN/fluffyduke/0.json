If chosen allied champion is not near you gain 2 per level plus 2% of your Attack and Ability Power.\r\n\r\n**Abilities (the fun stuff)**\r\n\r\n**1st Ability: **\r\nCooldown: 6\r\nMana Cost: 100\r\nA short (about the length of a ranged auto attack) straight line attack that hits all enemy champions and minions dealing 2/3/4/5/6% (+1% AP/+5% AD damage) physical damage, you gain vision of enemy champion for 4 seconds. After 2 seconds all that were hit are stunned for 1/1.25/1.5/1.75/2 seconds.\r\n\r\nThis gives you the caster to chase after and engage a champion, but of course it has some down sides like its short range and 2 second warning before it stuns. But of course a 1 second stun you can do a lot of damage in that time either solo or with a team mate.\r\n\r\n**2nd Ability: **\r\nCooldown: 15/14/13/12/11\r\nI think it&#039;s  a bit of a game changer myself. Ritoto jumps/blinks to a target location dealing 30/45/60/75/90/105(+70%AP +20%AD) magic damage in a small area, stealing Health. In the next 2 seconds the player can press the button to go back to location, doing the same damage.\r\n\r\nSo you can cast this twice, and get yourself healed. Pretty OP if you ask me =3\r\n\r\n**3rd Ability: **\r\nCooldown: 12\r\nMana Cost: 80/85/90/95/100\r\nPassive: Taking damage doubles your passive for 5 seconds (30 second cooldown).\r\nActive: Ritoto is invisible for 3 seconds if you stand still. You can cast abilities and deal damage and still be invisible.\r\n\r\nWhy I couldn&#039;t sleep because it hasn&#039;t been used like this before so I thought it was a kind of epic idea. You are invisible yet can do so much damage while being untargetable. You can still take damage from skill shots though.\r\n\r\nThe Passive is there for those with skillshots trying to hit you, you can do all sorts of fun stuff with the plays.\r\n\r\n**4th Ability:**\r\nCooldown: 140/120/100\r\nMana Cost: 100\r\nIt&#039;s a bit different from a normal one. Channeling for 5 seconds. The first 4 seconds it&#039;s 3/5/7 (+1%AP) percent health magic damage then 100/130/160 (+80% AP, +80%AD) pysical damage on the last hit. Which is about 1/3 to 1/2 health. This is dealt to surrounding champions in a 1000 units range and each allied champion will gain a 1 second shield equal to the amount of damage dealt per second to you and each allied champion within ult range.\r\n\r\nI don&#039;t know if this is OP or not, but basically I wanted something that can slowly shred tanks and then burst to take care of both tanks and squishies that are low. Then throw in some shields for you and allies as a support mechanic.","replies":[{"poster":"KDAs","date":"2016-02-17T21:56:23.055+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"what about amumu ? he is a child boy \n","replies":[]},{"poster":"atroquinine","date":"2016-02-17T09:16:31.670+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"this would be far better suited to dota lmao","replies":[{"poster":"FluffyDuke","date":"2016-02-17T20:59:09.865+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"never played it, riot all the way!","replies":[]}]}]}
