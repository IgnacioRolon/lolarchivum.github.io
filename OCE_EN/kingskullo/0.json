Looking for some helpful individuals to show me the ropes.  I enjoy the game, but my skill level is not too good.  I&#039;m currently in Bronze 3.  I can play good games, but they seem few and far between.  Happy to be a part of a team, but would also be happy to start one.  Would be happy to level up with other low levels and work together to get better.  Mostly play support, but would like to learn basics of playing any role.  If you&#039;re helpful and friendly, send me a message or look me up in-game.  kingskullo.","replies":[{"poster":"Yasei Doubutsu","date":"2015-10-26T15:45:04.612+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I can spectate some of your games if you wish, I can then Commentate on what your doing wrong and how you can improve if you wish.\n\nSomething like this.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7XPrqvD8Lfo&list=PLyCEt27AsZuvNu0RQiCwgV2j3tR4foqvI\n\nIm more then happy to try help you.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Aidan7787","date":"2015-10-27T02:50:20.370+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'm level bronze 5 and I need some serious help too","replies":[]},{"poster":"Tyron","date":"2015-10-26T20:26:08.278+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey bud, i added you in-game.
