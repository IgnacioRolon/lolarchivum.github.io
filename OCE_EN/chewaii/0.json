So I guess I am looking for some people to critique my skills and help me further my shoutcasting career. I can possibly get VODs or even if you are interested in wanting to help me I can do a live if you are that way inclined. Hopefully I worded so it makes actual sense. I guess I could list what I&#039;ve done.\r\n\r\n* QUT/UQ Autumn Split\r\n* QUT/UQ Finals\r\n* ggLoL Fight Night friday\r\n* Oceanic LoL various events\r\n* ACL PRO shoutcaster &quot;internship&quot;(Sadly I was unable to take the chance due to the fact I am living in QLD.)\r\n* Various other small events.\r\n\r\n\r\nThanks for taking the time to actually look at this post, you are awesome :)","replies":[{"poster":"Maraudaur","date":"2015-08-21T14:20:14.654+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Would be super helpful if you posted some links to your previous work","replies":[{"poster":"Chewaii","date":"2015-08-22T00:44:38.874+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Maraudaur,realm=OCE,application-id=Ntey9fRZ,discussion-id=miK36A7B,comment-id=0000,timestamp=2015-08-21T14:20:14.654+0000)\n>\n> Would be super helpful if you posted some links to your previous work\n\nI'll see if I can find any, since some I have bookmarked have been removed by the owners of the channel. :(","replies":[]}]}]}
