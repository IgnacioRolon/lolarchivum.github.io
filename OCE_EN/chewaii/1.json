I have done shoutcaster before in the past for little events but I'm currently looking for a bigger role within the community I love dearly.  I have had past experience with this matter working with ggLoL(An Oceanic Community) and after leaving that I have been on the search for a new community or just more events to shoutcast in general.\r\n\r\nNow you may be thinking, well what qualifications do you have? Well that's a good question you. In my role as a shoutcaster I work more on the in game analyst working out how team comps are going to run, looking at each players game, breaking down team fights and so forth. I also do a pretty mean beat box. (Also may or may not include puns((Poor mans Phreak))\r\n\r\nBecause of my analytical approach I work best in a group of 2-3 with my partners being able to yell out what is going on at any given time, Sooo I work best with people who take on a more....Korean approach. \r\n\r\nLook I'm not looking for anything big but the fact that you read all the way down here makes you awesome for taking time out of your day to read what I'm about so ty. \r\n\r\nSee you on the feels of Justice.{{champion:86}} \r\n\r\nIGN-Chewaii Skype: Contact me further.","replies":[{"poster":"Zero Infinity","date":"2015-03-03T06:32:36.909+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey,\n\nFirst off, good luck on your quest to become a shout caster.\nI myself share similar goal in that I would love to be an analyst!\n\nThe only piece of information I have relevant to you is an event being run by the Oceania  LOL facebook group. They are running a tournament quite soon, and they put a call for shout casters out at one point. If you contact admin (Bentley Barnes), you should be able to be on standby or a sub, if not the gig itself. \n\nJust a personal question now, would you be interested allowing me to be apart of your analyst process? I don't have any experience, but would love to start gaining some and at least discussing the game at a higher level than I currently think at. \nAnyway, I don't want to impose, so add me if you wish at Skyprus.\n\nThanks and good luck,\nSkyprus","replies":[{"poster":"Chewaii","date":"2015-03-03T06:39:36.992+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Skyprus,realm=OCE,application-id=Ntey9fRZ,discussion-id=MX5ZVF3X,comment-id=0000,timestamp=2015-03-03T06:32:36.909+0000)\n>\n> Hey,\n> \n> First off, good luck on your quest to become a shout caster.\n> I myself share similar goal in that I would love to be an analyst!\n> \n> The only piece of information I have relevant to you is an event being run by the Oceania  LOL facebook group.
