Now you may be thinking why should you give this random guy a chance, well that&#039;s a good question. So I have been within the league community for around 4 years now, working with such communities as ggLoL, UQ/QUT LoL, OceanicLoL. My skills as a caster come through in my humor, analytical skills and ability to adapt on the fly. I&#039;m not necessarily looking for any big gigs, just something which can give me further experience. If you would like to contact further, feel free to add me on league or comment bellow so we can exchange details. \r\n\r\nOf course you will need some type of evidence of my casting, sadly I do not have online evidence but I do have audio files I can send over and or we can skype and do it that way.\r\n\r\nCheers.","replies":[{"poster":"Atlus","date":"2015-06-05T04:40:52.731+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey Chewaii!\n\nGreat to see this on the boards man! \nHave you had a chat to anyone from ACL?

Unluckily for me being 1. A broke student and 2. Living in Brisbane I was unable to go down. \n\nI am casting something tonight, so I should have a VOD fresh and ready for you to watch later tonight. \n\nThanks for replying.","replies":[{"poster":"Atlus","date":"2015-06-09T01:05:19.505+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You're welcome, chuck it up here when you have time, I'd like to have a look =)","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"span","date":"2015-06-04T06:52:26.281+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"hey im currently looking to start up a team. once i get one started and get into some ranked 5's games i want to record them and upload them onto a team youtube channel. would you be interested in commentating some of our games?","replies":[{"poster":"Chewaii","date":"2015-06-04T11:46:25.321+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=span,realm=OCE,application-id=ATM3HYki,discussion-id=9sMFm8G8,comment-id=0000,timestamp=2015-06-04T06:52:26.281+0000)\n>\n> hey im currently looking to start up a team. once i get one started and get into some ranked 5's games i want to record them and upload them onto a team youtube channel. would you be interested in commentating some of our games?\n\nI would love to give that a go, add me to discuss.","replies":[]}]}]}
