I rarely play LoL anymore (maybe only during summer holidays - because University has been pretty busy).  Could anyone tell me why I am not unable to use the skin? Or am I wrong to think that it is a skin?","replies":[{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2019-11-12T04:20:11.210+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The Championship Zed content you can purchase for 300 tokens in a golden chroma only. You need to have the base skin to be able to use chromas.\n\nhttps://i.imgur.com/KDVBshk.png\n\nTo put it in perspective, the cost of an actual skin in tokens would be closer to the prestige edition skins (2000).","replies":[{"poster":"InstaLife","date":"2019-11-13T00:08:59.604+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Ahhh all chill.

This year was Ryze, and they re-released Ashe and Kha'Zix alongside him (2017 and 18 respectively), but Championship Zed was released 2016. It seems likely he's in the vault to stay as there don't appear to be any current plans for re-releasing the older Championship skins.\n\nThat said, most of them (CS Zed included) are loot eligible. That is you can earn their shards from hextech chests. So it's not impossible to *get* the skin, you just can't buy it directly.","replies":[]}]}]}]}
