Which in this case is to understand your champ and enemy's champ, synergies, the kits and build paths (essential items and optional build paths).\n\nI remember I used to die in the end/middle of every trade (I die then he dies or other way around) or every team fight after maybe scoring 1 or 2 kills/assists. Now I can sometimes score a few kills without dying, or die 4 times in a row without having any assists/kills/cs under my belt, talk about learning to be inconsistent.\n\nBut yes, that's how learning to improve works.\n\nTake notes from Master Yi newbs. \"The key to immortality?
