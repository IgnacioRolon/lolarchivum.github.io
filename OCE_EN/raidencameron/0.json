Between having options for using more tokens in one go (I believe you could exchange 50 at a time at one point), and having a higher exchange rate (I believe it peaked at 1 token to 10 BE), it certainly seems that Riot is moving *away* from supporting that.\n\nPersonally, I don't like what Riot have done with that, but I also don't think there's going to be enough feedback from the community wanting this stuff back.","replies":[]},{"poster":"WoadKethunt","date":"2019-05-16T00:40:45.212+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"riots to busy  dealing with staff riots lol","replies":[]}]}
