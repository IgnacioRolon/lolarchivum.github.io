But I don't try ridiculously hard to claim the kill (behind towers etc), and I've had a case where upon returning at level 1 with everyone else at around level 10 the entire team made beelines for me for an easy kill (even had a pantheon turret dive when I was at 100% health). \n\nI basically try not to make an issue of it. If they're in my way and I can kill them, fine, but it's not the objective of my game to mercilessly hunt players I know can't fight back.","replies":[]},{"poster":"BarryButcher","date":"2015-05-06T03:26:55.778+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"If they are blocking the push then yes.
