They are mechanically similar, but Annie's is better in practically every way.\n\nAnnie versus Viktor:\n-425 (+.8 AP) vs. 350 (+.55 AP) initial damage\n-35 (+.2)         vs. 45 (+.10) damage per second (starts dealing higher DPS past 100 AP)\n-45 second     vs. 7 second duration\n-80 second     vs. 100 second cooldown\n-1.75 second stun (when used with her passive) vs. channel disruption\n-Tibbers can tank towers, eat skill shots, and has a 130 damage auto attack\n\nThe only way that Viktor's is better is that it has 100 higher range.\n\nOn paper, Tibbers is one of the strongest single abilities in the game. It's an AoE stun (assuming Annie is halfway decent and uses it with her passive) with massive burst damage, massive DoT, and a lot of team utility. \n\nIMO they should reduce Tibber's burst damage and increase it's DoT. If it's going to last 45 seconds, it should have more of its power focused around damage over time and zone control, and less around insta-gibbing people. Annie's instant burst is pretty silly right now anyways--she can dump 895 (+2.45 AP) in a split second, with no counter play aside from staying out of her range 24/7, which isn't possible for all champions unless they want to be perma-zoned. Melee fighters get screwed by her, and most ADCs can't touch her unless she's already CC'd, since her spell ranges are higher than most auto attacks. \n\nFrom their recent statement on Annie, it kind of sounds like Riot is already considering doing something like this. I hope they do. I don't think Annie is OP, because she's insanely easy to counter pick. But she's really not fun at all to play against. I don't want an Annie nerf, but I would love to see a shift that maintains her current power level while allowing for more dynamic counterplay than \"never get in her range.\"","replies":[{"poster":"the true Viper","date":"2015-01-20T07:38:11.993+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"She got nerfed a while back.
