You can predict where he would throw it pretty easily. Most of the time stepping towards Ekko if he uses W to engage is a sure way to dodge it as he will most likely expect you to continue running (if you are trying to run away).\n\nI do actually think because of E's dash that it gives Ekko plenty of ways to escape or disengage coupled with his W.  You can ward jungle monsters so that you can blink through walls with the second E. \nIn lane phase this is often the ability used to quickly land the third Z-Drive Resonance stack on targets who have been hit twice with Timewinder (Q).\n\nSupresses, stuns and knock ups stop Ekko from casting this. You can also clearly see his ghost if you have vision of Ekko himself.\nIt's also worth to note that Ekko's heal is relative to the amount of damage he has taken within the four seconds. Whittling him down slowly (he is pretty squishy early) helps in somewhat 'reducing' his heal, Burst damage will dramatically increase Ekko's heal. Harass him if you can, obviously much easier if you're ranged.","replies":[{"poster":"Armpitpleasures","date":"2015-06-22T22:26:24.129+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Ok thanks","replies":[]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Armpitpleasures","date":"2015-06-22T23:02:09.490+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"So im told his scaling is low lol.. yet a. Q, at level 5, 60% Slow, and over 900 damage with a huge hitbox . W, shield that gives him a 300+80% shield, and gives passive extra AP damage to any target under 30% hp!  and his shield can be activated whilst I**N STASIS** __(wtf)\n\nHis chasing ability becuase of his roll is excellent, allows him to team fight engage, and disengage, and go through objects.   \n\nHis ULT is def most broken. Aat 500 plus 130% is the second highest scaling in the game apart from malzahars (550 plus 130%).  However Malz ult makes him vulnerable and is single target  where as ekkos heals him and can teleport him out of battle  and is aoe ! In fact, land 2 passive stacks on a target  before ulting and it can heal for over 1500health (LOL) .  AND with max cd you can get it down to **48secs**.\n\nEkko is also surprisingly tanky with his shield at 2s duration (remember old riven) and heal and his slipperiness  equals little counter play and is equally good as an early game lane bully and late game team fighter.  Sure the jungler can camp him but  at the sacrifice of  your other lanes.\n\nEkkos ban rate of 75.52% in ranked games should also be a wakeup call.\n\nI believe they need to detune his ult at the very least  which Riot probably will after they have made millions from him.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Olee","date":"2015-06-22T05:25:19.278+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"lol","replies":[]},{"poster":"darknoonbeam","date":"2015-06-21T23:25:22.785+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"OCE Ekko skin - Cooooeeeeey.\n \n\nYou're welcome.","replies":[]}]}
