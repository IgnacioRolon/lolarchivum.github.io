That said, Smurfing is not necessarily condoned by Riot Games and various individuals in the League of Legends community as Smurfing generally entails an experienced player creating an alternate account that is seemingly unexperienced which can be seen as an unfair advantage on those players who are legitimately new to the game. That said, upon creating an account Riot provides the option of selecting your experience level from First Timer to Veteran. From this it is ideal that you pick the option that is most truthful to your situation and upon being truthful will match you up with other Smurfs. Supposedly. \n\nInterestingly enough. I {{champion:86}} tee that you will find that about 1/4 of all League of Legends accounts are Smurfs. \n\nRegards,\nFog","replies":[{"poster":"Armpitpleasures","date":"2015-01-28T03:31:42.345+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thank you for the response.  \nA quarter of all accounts !\n\nmaybe i should go back to scrabble since it  doesn't appear likely this situation will change any time soon. :(","replies":[{"poster":"Project Xayah","date":"2015-01-28T05:05:37.235+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Basically what Fog said. In no way is it against any rules set by Riot, and there is generally nothing wrong with it, but then you get some bad apples ruining the bunch. There are a lot of smurfs out there who don't act all high and mighty that respect their fellow players and they are generally the ones who don't mention they're using a smurf. But then you get the, and forgive my language, assholes who brag about being a smurf and treat others like sh!t because it's low level/ELO. And to top it all off there are a significant number of players who claim to be high ELO smurfs who are really just new players, thus furthering the stereotype that smurfs are a bad thing. I feel you in regards to the assholes out there, we all get our unfair share of it, but there's not much that can be done outside reporting.","replies":[{"poster":"Dawaraven","date":"2015-01-28T08:24:28.976+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I killed a lvl 5 nasus player with 3 CS 10 mins while playing yorick\n\n\"I am master smurf best top OCE better than dyrone git gud u pleb\"","replies":[{"poster":"Project Xayah","date":"2015-01-28T08:49:29.086+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Basically.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"TrashDonnut","date":"2015-01-28T03:33:37.513+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"/mute all \n\nAt the start of game.\n\n\nEnjoy.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Dawaraven","date":"2015-01-28T05:05:21.082+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"People playing chamions with legendary skins are the ones LEAST likely to be smurfs lol.","replies":[]},{"poster":"GoldenTomat0","date":"2015-01-28T03:16:35.673+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"yes. why wouldn't it be?","replies":[{"poster":"Armpitpleasures","date":"2015-01-28T03:34:00.489+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"DId you even read after the first line.\nMaybe you just don't care or smurf yourself.
