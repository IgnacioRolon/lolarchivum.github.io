If you want 7 rune pages buy 4 of the bundles and get 8.\n\n7 rune page bundle is 2600 RP\n4 x 2 rune page bundle is 2360RP (8 pages)\n\nWhat I think you were hinting at though, is trying to buy the 7 page bundle and get 14 pages correct? LMAO\nIf you think Riot are dumb enough to sell you 14 rune pages for 2600RP, think again LOL You can't buy the 7 page bundle and expect it to also be 2 for 1.","replies":[]}]}
