(Sorry for the long read xD)\n\nAfter coming back from North America and finally getting use to the ping change, I&#039;m looking on creating a team built around improvement. If you are NOT serious about improving then don&#039;t bother applying. (For awhile the games will be not too serious as we need to define little grounding first)\n\nThere will be a schedule to follow and also little reviews of games on occasions to know what needs to work on. (Schedule will be sorted out based on people interested in joining.)\n\nAttitude doesn&#039;t need to be solely focused to a goal, there is still plenty of fun to have and please don&#039;t resist trying to play more then the schedule with only few members of the team.\n\nNeeds:- Curse Voice, Skype, also after awhile I will make a Google Doc that everyone can see to show a nice formatted schedule and information.\n\nOpen positions :\nTop (Filled)\nJungle (Filled)\nMid \nAdc (Filled)\nSupport (Filled)\n\nTo apply, Just send a reply to this discussion with details that you think I might want to look over. (NOTE: It could take up to 7 days for me to see your application so dont be so discouraged if you don&#039;t have a immediate response!)\n\nBut what about me? Me? Currently I am Silver 3 and have on a steady climb since ive moved to Oceania from North America in around October 2015. I am a support main and have branched into all roles but I still excel greatly in Support. I have been in two teams in North America, one was just purely practice and we only made it to silver, then I went onto a different team that peaked at Platinum IV.","replies":[{"poster":"TheScaryOne","date":"2015-12-16T09:22:46.798+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hello im morgan Im Plat 5 ive palyed leauge since beta i quit for a few years n came back season 3 and been here since then started in bronze season 3 i can play and were jungle and adc are my 2 worst role i perfer top :)","replies":[]},{"poster":"MPA Bill Cosby","date":"2015-12-15T21:19:28.170+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey there, i'm Raygor. My rank is silver 4, I main adc in solo queue but in my previous team that played in tournaments i played top which has now become like a second main. As for voice comms, I have skype, curse voice, and game vox and willing to download others if needed.\n\nA bit about myself is that I have been playing league since post season 2-preseason 3 but only been playing seriously since early season 4. I have been in multiple ranked teams and the highest going to gold 5 - which later disbanded. I am known in my group for being a consistent player and always positive. I am constantly looking at ways to improve whether that be watching streams or videos from high ELO players or playing solo queue. And i feel that a ranked team would be the best place for me to improve.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Deep Sanity","date":"2015-12-15T15:14:08.402+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey, im Deep Sanity -\nIm currently Silver 5\nI mostly prefer Jungle or Top, but i can play any role well if needed but not so much of support\ni have skype and curse and ill can download any other comms if needed to\n\nwell i have been playing league since half way of s2 i have quite a bit of experience in teams (only started in s4), but my highest rank within a team as been silver 5 which is still going. i do get a bit salty when i make a mistakes but then i pick up and become positive for my team and move on, But thats about it i hope you would consider me for this team.
