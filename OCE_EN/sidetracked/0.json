I second the recommendation to play ARAM in slumps.\n\nI take frequent breaks from League, though I can never really stop playing for too long.\nI find it hard to get the same mechanical satisfaction from other games. Even if other MOBAs have better communities, they just don't feel right, and they don't have the unique characters that I love. I swear I am so bored by hearing Dota players telling me excitedly about the *single* tanky lady they have, as if that somehow competes with being able to choose from 3 main tank ladies and several others who can get kinda tanky with the right build. :P it's really not the same.\n\nAnyway though, I main support, so I understand the pain of bot lane. You can turn an average player into a great one if you play right, but say, playing Soraka you can never really carry a team by yourself the way a good Tryndamere could, so your game history can start looking reaaal sorry after a while. I got some hostility from people in solo queue who looked up my match history and saw five losses in a row. But for one of those losses I got an S ranking and it was honestly a great, tight game, I had so much fun. Three were surrenders--I was outvoted on two, and I gave up and surrendered for the third because I was tired of the bad team synergy and just wanted it over, instead of trying to lose with honour or turn the game around. It was so frustrating to put genuine energy into so many games, only to have people give me flack for it when I continued trying. I'm not a perfect player, which is why I stick to norms, but some people still act like it's a great personal offence that you have fun and enjoy a game when they're trying to _win _in a system that's set up so it's statistically impossible to win every time. >_>\nI'm probs talking too much so I'll get back to it--\n\nI think this is the point when self-care gets really important. Take time out for yourself, have a snack, do life things, don't burn out on League. It's a great game, addictive as hell, but you and your time are **important**.\nI know it's easier said than done to not waste time on something that doesn't make you happy. But you really don't deserve to keep hitting your head against a wall when the wall is refusing to break. Especially since said wall is entirely optional.\nGo back over your to-play or to-read list, if you have one. There are so many amazing worlds to escape into, it can be a shame to only use one. Short narrative indie games can be a really good break, and since they have an ending, they don't stop you from coming back to League if you find the urge taking you again.","replies":[{"poster":"Sidetracked","date":"2016-04-18T23:34:45.410+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thanks for the really well written response, I do take alot of breaks but I don't really like aram to much but my whole objective of actually typing to people rather then just playing was to finally get some people who I can talk and play with as I find that ALOT more enjoyable however if in a game, I tell them to \"have a wonderful day\" the replies I get are followed with harassment and what I meant by giving up is not on league itself, I enjoy league I meant on just giving up on the fact that dream of finding someone nice for once.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"ontheleg","date":"2016-04-23T08:12:32.205+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey man, 2 years back one or two of my mates from school started playing league, and to be honest the rest of us thought they were \"gay\" or just joking. But one day we all got together and watched them and since then we have all been playing league occasionally, chatting through Skype and having some fun and banter.\n\nIf you go to University, Tafe or School, you should be able to find people that also play the game as it is one of the largest free to play games in the world. If you can't, just talk to your mates and tell them to try it out with you. You can queue up together and call each other while playing, its quite a fun experience.\n\nIf you're already past schooling stage and you work full-time/part-time, do what Telecasterdude said:\n\n* Go check out the events site. Join up for some events and viewing parties, it's a great place to find new friends and communities.\n\n* See what you can find on the forums, our Team Recruitment and Clubs sections have heaps of summoners looking for players everyday.\n\nGood luck :)","replies":[]},{"poster":"Tele","date":"2016-04-16T09:05:50.655+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I always play ARAM when I get into slumps like this. There's way less pressure and the community is pretty nice.\n\nBut if you're not into that there's always other options:\n\n+ If you go to Uni you might be able to find some friends there.
