(Both Ranked and normals, blind and draft) I had the usual fun of playing league, but voicing positivity, every game that i played besides from 2 had everyone being negative from, me receiving comments to eat dirt, and more that I really rather not say, after doing this for this weekend it really drained me, being constantly harassed for what seems no reason for just normally starting the game by saying 'Good luck beautifuls! Have fun!\r\n\r\nIm not entirely sure my reason in posting this, i just thought it was really sad and had really killed my mood for playing League of legends. With all this im not sure i really want to play league for awhile after this, especially since my friends dont play league anymore","replies":[{"poster":"Exarch Leona","date":"2019-12-20T12:11:05.938+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I should get you to play with me. \nI can get people hyped right from the start and get the game rolling.

If that mindset can be banned for 14 days i just gave up with league personally would recommend before you put way to much money on this game.\n{{champion:202}}","replies":[]}]}
