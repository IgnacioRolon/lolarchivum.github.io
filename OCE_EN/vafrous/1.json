We play Fri-Sun (or when time allows during the weekday) and hope to improve and climb together as a team.\nWe also update tables of statistics/strats and once in a while, a YouTube clip of highlights/fails and gameplay. This is all done by our support. Two of us are unable to speak in Skype for reasons, but it&#039;s preferred if you are able to communicate and any shot-calling ability is a plus too.\n\nAdd me IG if interested: **Opia**\n\nThanks, have a good day. :)","replies":[{"poster":"ZoharMasni","date":"2015-07-20T06:50:24.878+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Iam GOLD 1 and climbing plat soon !
