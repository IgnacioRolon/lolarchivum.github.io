It&#039;s very useful on tanks and just good in general. But there&#039;s not enough of it. You can get some from runes and a bit from Merc treads. But there is nothing more disheartening than using righteous glory just to be hit by a morgana snare and put in a 3 second time out. So my suggestion is that there could be more items that feel better to use. Dead man&#039;s plate for example. That momentum towards a champion and the sound it makes when you hit it is great. Makes you feel unstoppable. But then you are hit with a smattering of cc and killed. So maybe add tenacity to that and have it based off deadmans charge. Or have a new item that is kind of like an old Poppy ultimate, where you choose a target and all damage and cc from everyone else is reduced by 10. But if there were to be an increase of availability of tenacity, current items that do give it might need slight percent nerfs otherwise champions that DO build tenacity already aren&#039;t literally unstoppable.

Light zoning CC typically has a long duration but a low impact, and are a bit more plentiful in team fights but are important for a team's overall ability to peel.\n\nTenacity is a very dangerous stat to mess with, if you've seen a few of the tenacity stack monsters that existed for some times on PBE you'd understand why Riot is very careful when adding tenacity to items or champions.","replies":[{"poster":"Lord Sesshomaru","date":"2018-12-13T10:12:07.274+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Maybe it could be tweaked to allow for that? Idk\n\nLike the difference between armour pen and lethality, or blind and disarm.\nMake a clear distinction about what is and isn't affected by Tenacity or whatever new name you wanna call it. Knockups suppression and stasis already aren't affected by Tenacity.  If you're going to have exceptions, why not just go full hog and divvy up the CC into what can be reduced further and what cant.\n\nMaybe when the game used to be simpler, adding in more situationally specific shit wouldn't have been a good idea.  But it's 2018 now and there's so many stats/stat modifiers/on-hit effects now, that its practically impossible to keep track of it all, especially in a team fight. \nIn a team fight you're never going to mentally do the calculations of what happens if you have X tenacity, but get hit by Morgana's Q after being brittle from Ornn, but are also sleepy from Zoe's bubble. We have well past the point of in game clarity now, unfortunately.  So adding yet another semi-similar-but-the-same-but-also-different stat, probably wouldn't be too much harm (as much as that pains me to say).\n\nBecause while you don't want to have monsters like Garen who just cant be CCed, you also don't want tame CC just being a death sentence  for squishier champs, like it often is currently. Even a medium+ slow will put most immobile champs in the grave now in many situations.\n\nWhat would you recommend to counteract how the Damage/MS creep affects CC potency?","replies":[{"poster":"Nightjar","date":"2018-12-14T01:54:50.883+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"personally I've a very big fan of cleanse items, and I am very very very unhappy that Mikaels Crucible has been relegated to such a super niche proplay item.
