Rather then seeing someone with like 50-200 Normal wins.\n\nMaster at least 3 roles, even though now you can choose what you get.\nAnd have at least 3 champions for each.\n\nGood Luck Have Fun.","replies":[]},{"poster":"QAPLA","date":"2016-08-31T00:23:36.133+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I also recommend playing a bunch of ARAMs to practice team fighting.\nOn the rift, you (usually) spend very little time per game in actual 5v5 teamfights.

And if you jump into ranked with an unfinished rune page that doesn't really suit your champion, you are putting yourself at a HUGE disadvantage against players like me who have champion tailored rune/mastery pages (and will be in your MMR bracket). \n\nDo what Yasei recommends, learn 3 champs comfortably for each role, then pick one of those roles and then play those champions to death, then go and buy the counters of those champions and play THOSE champions to death to give you the advantage when vsing them.","replies":[]}]}
