A Korean account has to be linked to Korean citizenship so they run on a slightly different account creation and management system than regular/unrestricted accounts do.\n\nAs far as I know this holds true even if you have a Korean citizenship and an account on another region you wish to transfer. You'd have to create a new account to use on the KR server.\n\nYou can ask player support for more details, but I wouldn't get your hopes up: https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/requests/new","replies":[]}]}
