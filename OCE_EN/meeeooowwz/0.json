If ranked isn&#039;t on your radar just yet, I&#039;d be happy to add more fellow league players and play some normals with and have fun. A chilled team is always good, so feel free to add me/message me in game :)","replies":[{"poster":"Fennix","date":"2015-12-28T07:36:11.468+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"im silver V but am interested in playing :D sounds like a lot of fun :)","replies":[]}]}
