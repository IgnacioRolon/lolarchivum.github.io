Riot works by periodical ban waves hence why you'll most likely see a mass influx of 'Permanently banned?' threads across the forums around the same time. If you've previously used MKJogo / Wooxy and there are any remnants of the programs in your system it most likely would've been detected on their end whether you were actively using it or not. \n\nI was one of the rare cases that was a false positive and my permanent suspension was lifted but if you have used any sort of 3rd party software prior and have not vanilla reinstalled your game there's minimum hope of it being lifted as you theoretically were breaking the game rules although using custom skins is a 'grey area' some software gave additional advantages.","replies":[{"poster":"Kakoda","date":"2017-02-16T09:06:08.416+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Yeah I have not used any of these things in fact I have not used anything at all that would effect lol.

I mean shit they can go through every single game and see that there is not scripts or 3rd party program. I suck at dodging skill shots apart from the random lucky juke here an there. I miss a lot of spells, like clearly I am not cheating. I would just like someone to show me one game that is remotely questionable you know? Because I am 100% sure I have done nothing wrong.\n\nLike I said if i done something wrong I would accept the punishment that is the kind of person I am. Though when I am accused of something I did not do that is different. Like seriously if they can show me one game where cheats or something were used fine ban be but I know they could never find one because I have never used anything. This is my issue they will not check my games or anything they wont give me anything that will back up there ban.\n\nIf they said I was toxic sure I could live with that, I know I can at times get shitty at my team, most of us do. Though that was not the case. If it was I would take the ban make a new account and start again. Problem is if they detect something and I have no idea what it is the next account I make will be ban again. \n\nI need to know what casued to ban because clearly there system has detected something but not using skins or scripts or anything in that matter I have no idea what caused it.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Kakoda","date":"2017-02-16T09:40:55.891+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hopefully that is the case.

I want a solution, as I have been wronged.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Klavinmour","date":"2017-02-14T13:32:27.946+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"\"I would and have never used any 3rd Party Software that would be against Riot Games policy.\" this sounds like you've used some 3rd party software of some sort.\n\nRiot can not tell the difference between a hack or whatever else, they only care that the code is not stock standard.\nThis is why halfway through this season custom skins will be banned entirely, because the automatic detection of 3rd party software already detects and autobans for custom skins and there is nothing Riot can do to change that.\n\nIt's also notable that Riot will never clarify a ban over 3rd party software, because doing so might accidentally let slip a way that someone can design a hack/script that gets around Riot's detection.\nYou will only ever get a copy paste response for this.","replies":[{"poster":"Its Calamari","date":"2017-02-15T06:41:54.679+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yeah I know but two years ago? this was back when custom skins were not attained to and it must has poisoned my client and I asked for help and they responded with the same thing","replies":[{"poster":"Klavinmour","date":"2017-02-15T06:58:01.339+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"That wouldn't have any impact on your account being banned now.","replies":[{"poster":"Its Calamari","date":"2017-02-15T07:54:19.955+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Then i'm confused why i'm banned.","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"ByNinja85","date":"2017-02-15T06:41:44.506+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I am Its Calamari's friend have played with him probs 20% of my games.
