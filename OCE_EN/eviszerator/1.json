When I don't have the menu open, it still stays there obscuring vision in that part of the screen. Sometimes, it covers the entire length of the enemy health spawn timers as well (to give a mental image). The most annoying aspect is when this happens and it blacks out the items UI portion at the bottom right, so I have no idea what my active items cd timers are at (if/when I buy any of course).\n\nThis usually occurs after a team mate or enemy team dies. The only way to fix this I find is to quit and reconnect, but half the time the issue resurfaces after another death happens. A lot of the time the colour is solid black like this which causes no clear way of seeing what's on that part of the screen. Other times I've seen it be gold, green or contrasted to white, but unlike the solid black I can still see through it and my items.\n\nTo be clear, this only occurs during ARAM mode. I've never had it happen to Summoner's Rift or the rotating game modes (Haven't tried Twisted Treeline to see if it occurs there also).\n\nDoes anyone have a clue what's going on? Thank you.","replies":[]}
