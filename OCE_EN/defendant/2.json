I'm not very active this year due to real-life problems but I am playing a bit more now (in-fact I re-installed league just a month ago) \r\nI peaked plat 4 last season and was a Jungle main last season. \r\nThis season climbed to plat with jungle, got hardstuck so I changed roles.\r\n\r\nPlease add me if you're an aggressive adc (Draven, Lucian players are most welcome!) but if you like scaling I can play too, I just need someone that's NOT TOXIC :) good luck on the rift","replies":[]}
