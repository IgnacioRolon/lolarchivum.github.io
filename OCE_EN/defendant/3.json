Today I played on JP just for fun and i've got 280 ping.  Does anyone know how I can reduce this? I know this might/should be posted on the JP boards but I don't speak Japanese.  I just like playing on that server because it's a bit more relaxing - and I doubt anyone on there would have the same situation as me.\r\n\r\nThank you","replies":[{"poster":"Lord Sesshomaru","date":"2019-12-14T13:54:37.685+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Short answer, no, not really.\nSorry\n\nThe ping is the time it takes for the signal to go from your computer, to the server (in Japan), back to your computer again. So unless you move closer to the server, or speed up the signal travel time (install fibre).  There's not really much you can do.\n\nI have the reverse situation, I live in Japan, but play on the OCE sever, and I'm always sitting at 230+ ping.  So why you were ever at 110 is a mystery to me.\n230 is playable, once you get used to it.  It's not 'relaxing' but it's possible.\n\nYou shouldn't have too much of a problem posting on the Japanese boards, virtually no one on the server is actually Japanese anyway. _(it's not really a game that is known in Japan, or appeals to the Japanese audience. In my time here, I've never met a singe person who has even heard of it.)_\n\nIt's mostly people from close countries like Taiwan.  Or Korean and Chinese people looking for an easier game that play on the server.  So, many players will have a basic understanding of English as those countries have a much higher level of English than Japan.  In fact some of those talking in Japanese in the server are probably doing so as a second language anyway.  However I doubt even if you got a response, there would be anything that could be done.  I believe It's a location issue rather than a settings thing.\n\nBut good luck!","replies":[]}]}
