Regardless, here is the conversation:\r\n\r\n試合 1\r\nゲーム内\r\nLemonadeDan: come\r\n\r\nLemonadeDan: no ability \r\nLemonadeDan: ???\r\nLemonadeDan: my q and e down\r\nThis is when my Jax called me a brainless when he was trying to gank my lane when I pinged my E was on CD. so I don't chase and just continue to farm pinging him to backoff\r\n\r\nLemonadeDan: what do u want me to do\r\nLemonadeDan: flash and auto attack him?\r\nHim talking shit so I talk back. And it is true, wtf am I supposed to do with both of my abilities on CD\r\n\r\nLemonadeDan: mid\r\nLemonadeDan: lane swap\r\nMid was feeding super hard\r\n\r\nLemonadeDan: gg we lost surrender please\r\nLemonadeDan: dont waste time\r\nWe were losing super hard. every lane and even jungle was losing. \r\n\r\nLemonadeDan: ???\r\nLemonadeDan: LMAO qss can cancel my ult wtf\r\nI'm still pretty new to morderkaiser and I found out this game that qss can remove his death realm. or 死の国 in Japanese (pretty sick name I must add, it means Death Kingdom or Death Country)\r\n\r\nLemonadeDan: report jax toxic\r\nUnderstandable\r\n\r\nLemonadeDan: thats actually so stupid\r\nLemonadeDan: one item counters my ult\r\nMe complaining that qss can cancel my R.\r\n\r\nLemonadeDan: team wont ff game over at 10 minutes\r\nMe just complaining in all chat (this was me being kind of a dick).\r\n\r\n\r\nI've never been banned on League before and I'm usually not toxic - this is probably the most rude I've been to my teammates and I usually don't directly talk shit unless someone's being really dumb and saying stupid stuff about me when they're clearly at fault.\r\nIn addition, I got a chat restriction only after ONE SINGLE GAME? I didn't even know that was possible - I always thought you had to be at least in multiple games to be punished for this shit.  I don't mind about being chat restricted, it's only 10 games but it's just super unfair.","replies":[{"poster":"Broken Scripts","date":"2019-12-30T11:59:14.294+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"1. You're speaking English on a Japanese server.\n\nThat's a huge no-no. As someone who frequents Japanese servers, they tend to instantly disregard anything you say unless you clearly know Japanese, as well. Even if your Japanese is bad, they would rather that over reading English. I have had Japanese players call me bad (not as mean as it sounds, they offered advice, it just translates badly) and then apologise when I spoke Japanese. I was essentially comboing wrong to them and when I explained that a lot of English players do it the way I am, we had a long discussion about the pros and cons of the rotation.\n\n2. You were toxic.\n\nThere is no defending your actions. Japanese players are very quiet and very respectful. Not all of them, but most are. They do not like to argue, they do not like to hear people whining. To clear it up, you're a guest on their server, even more so if you're speaking English. You essentially walked into their home, didn't wipe your feet, urinated on their floor and didn't clean it up, made yourself a sandwich, and then asked them to make you a hot drink.\n\nWhen you are on a foreign server, you shut. Your. Mouth. You don't talk, you don't whine, you don't rage, you don't AFK, and you don't spam pings. You learn the basic greetings, maybe explain that you can't speak perfect Japanese, and you put your hands in your lap, smile, and behave.\n\nI don't care if they were abusive or toxic to you. You're the reason why Japanese people have a, \"No English\" rule. You're the reason why they judge us. Japanese people are very serious and outwardly giving up, even if it's doomed, is a bad sign. I have seen them dedicate 90 minutes to a raid on FFXIV that was not possible, but they were certain and it was some experience for everyone, even if we were doing bad.\n\nIf you're not capable of being respectful, mute them.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Project Xayah","date":"2019-12-30T02:01:17.260+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"Based on the chat logs provided, I'm inclined to think there's more to this than appears, whether some contributing logs have been excluded from the reform card or whether it is a false positive. The most problematic parts seem to be a bit of negative attitude and giving up, and I don't think that would be enough to trigger a punishment in this case (based on the amount shown), It's possible that the comment \"thats actually so stupid\" *may* have been misidentified during the review process, but even so I doubt that would make and considerable difference.\n\nYou best option would be to submit a ticket to [Support](https://support-leagueoflegends.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/requests/new) (use the \"discuss a personal suspension or restriction\" option) and they will review the case manually, and correct any errors (if any exist) or provide more context if necessary.\n\nIt's important to note that Japan may have *slightly* different rules and guidelines for what is/isn't acceptable, but I don't think that would make a difference in this case, based on the available information.","replies":[{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2019-12-30T10:38:07.175+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"Normally I wouldn't say it would make a substantial difference and would really only be relevant in a borderline case, but given Japan's cultural views on respect and the like, it's entirely possible the difference is quite significant.\n\nIt's also possible there was relevant pre or post-game chat that wasn't included in the reform card for some reason. Player Support can obviously provide that :)","replies":[]}]}]}
