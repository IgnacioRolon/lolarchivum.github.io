It was my original League of Legends account that I created back in Season 4 and it even has an ultimate skin on it.  I've spent a bit of cash on the account and I also want to play my placement games so I can receive the end of season skin \r\n\r\nUnfortunately I don't remember the login details.  As I no longer have access to the email I used to create it with (high school email) I'm unsure of how I can recover my account.  I have previously email Riot about this via their support services but they didn't really help tbh anyways...\r\n\r\nI do know the In Game username of my account and likely the password (as I keep my passwords quite limited, I only have 6 or 7 variations of the passwords I use) I just need to find out my login username.","replies":[{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2019-10-12T06:40:49.948+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The only way to recover such an account is through an account recovery ticket with support.\n\nThey'll ask you a whole bunch of questions to verify ownership. You don't have to answer all, but you do have to answer most. If you find yourself unable to answer a lot of the specific questions, any information that is unique to the account but not visible on it is helpful.\n\nIf they can't verify ownership, then unfortunately there's no way to recover the account.","replies":[]}]}
