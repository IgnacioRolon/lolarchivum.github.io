I&#039;ve been playing Ashe as my main AD Carry for a long while now, but nothing took away my breath like this. The eyes and hair show a softer side that I will explain why that got to me so much. I know Ashe has a plethora of skins to choose from but alot of them I feel don&#039;t accentuate her lady like side. I get it, she&#039;s a queen and independent, but three of her skins [Freljord, Woad, Sherwood Forest] feel like Chromas and the rest well.\r\n\r\nQueen Ashe worked amazingly in with the lore, however the skin feels pretty heavy with that dress compared to the sleek and agile (Even with no mobility traits) Archer that should be destroying a back line of enemies.\r\n\r\nMarauder feels like a serious mesh of grey that&#039;s hard to distinguish some of Ashe&#039;s key features and what she&#039;s about, which is being a serious archer and queen that shows her face to the enemy with no fear.\r\n\r\nAmethyst and HeartSeeker both portray two different Ashes. A Stunning beauty and a sort of gemstone intune champion like Taric. Since I could (Around Season 3), I used Amethyst, The slight Purple tint on my arrows felt like it meshed extremely well concept wise for a skin. It wasn&#039;t a huge change, but that paired with the new features of her hair and armor worked well.\r\n\r\nThis skin would show off a different side of Ashe. A goofy, go lucky funner Ashe. Something less serious and more about just amazingness. It&#039;s not impossible for this, as Meowkai, DravenDraven, PoolParty Skins and alot of other skins show a more goofy and funner side. and if you ask what you can do with the skins well I came up with ideas with that too.\r\n\r\nAuto Attacks and Arrows: Keep them normal! This skin can afford to keep them normal for now for reasons I will explain below\r\n\r\nQ - Ranger&#039;s Focus: When activated, your bow glows with the power of kittens, the glow can be pretty much any aesthetically pleasing colour Riot chooses. The main attraction of this ability will be every extra bolt fired could be a different colour of the rainbow or a set 5 colours. It gives the ability more of an impact on use then. Like the sound of a Nasus farming Q or a Jarvan flag hitting the ground. Impact and feeling good while using an Ability is huge in League, and without it, champions feel dull or even useless when they are not. This is shown with Sona, getting small changes to all her abilities to try engage the player more with the character and make her feel less like just some AoE buff that flutters around.\r\n\r\nW - Volley: This one is pretty simple. Assign each arrow a separate colour to form a rainbow. Since there are 9 arrows in the arc, you may need to repeat two colours but I doubt anyone would care if it had two of the same colour in the rainbow from repeating.\r\n\r\nE - Hawkshot: Or in this case, a kitten with wings? This is one of the harder ones, but also going to be a more unique one. Heartseeker Ashe did this well, changing the Hawk to a Dove that explodes into rose petals and more importantly, sparkly sparkly vision. This is a HUGE thing as I don&#039;t believe (Correct me if I am wrong) any of her other skins actually change Hawkshot much. Making an explosion with a slight rainbow particle or the kitten being launched off by a rainbow would be so very amusing and fun, maybe even coaxing people in using this AMAZING ABILITY more than for just checking Baron or Dragon.\r\n\r\nR - Enchanted Crystal Arrow: By far, the coup de gr&acirc;ce that pulls this entire skin concept all together. Now I had alot of base ideas for this, and let me tell you why some didn&#039;t work.\r\n\r\n&quot;Why not make the ability a giant Kitten?&quot;: One of the biggest things in League of Legends in Clarity. The hit-box on this would be ridiculously hard to show. Not only this but it would be probably much harder work wise than recolouring or adding particles to an already existing arrow shape.\r\n\r\n&quot;Let&#039;s have the ability explode into a flurry of kittens&quot;: Again with clarity on League of Legends. Imagine a teamfight, where you have multiple abilities shooting everywhere. The last thing you want on both sides is an explosion of kittens blocking your field of vision or having a massive particle effect that overshadows other abilities. Pair the Ashe ult with the particle effects from the kit of an Aurelion Sol, Taric or Viegar. It would be, to be frank, a Fustercluck {Spoonerism}.\r\n\r\nWith all this said, I settles for the idea of making the Arrow just a rainbow arrow. Maybe have the arrow normal coloured with a fancy rainbow particle following it like Hecarim&#039;s E - Devastating Charge with his Arcade Skin. Keep the integrity of an Archer with the arrow shape while also staying clear of overusing particles all while keeping the theme of this adorable yet deadly archer. Maybe you could have a little kitten on the head or tail of the arrow as something small, but the best thing is to keep this clear and ready for everyone to see.\r\n\r\nThat&#039;s it for this case. Thanks to Kyomon for inspiring me to write all this with her amazing art and her information is on the picture attached. I hope we can get this for Ashe, because I feel like she needs the love.","replies":[{"poster":"Catspeare","date":"2016-06-18T01:50:42.740+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"YES I SUPPORT THIS 10/10 I WOULD BUY THIS SKIN INSTANTLY OMG YES PLEASE GIANT CAT ULT.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Talon12","date":"2016-06-18T02:21:40.945+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"\"too sexual, riot would never allow it\"","replies":[]},{"poster":"Erøse","date":"2016-06-18T00:17:14.285+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"TITTIES","replies":[]},{"poster":"CHEESYLEEKS","date":"2016-06-17T00:00:58.868+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Tits.","replies":[{"poster":"Fitzky","date":"2016-06-17T05:22:11.395+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)","replies":[]}]}]}
