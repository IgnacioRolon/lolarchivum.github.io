I played a game and there was a player on my team who was EXTREMELY toxic and harassed me. I was having a bad game and tried to ignore them. They didn&#039;t stop. I then tried to reason with them. They still didn&#039;t stop. Eventually, I was so sick of it I said a few mean things but that&#039;s all. I have never gotten a warning or a temporary ban or anything along those lines. But out of nowhere after the game, I log back in after the game crashes and I have a message telling me I&#039;m part of the 0.006% of players toxic enough to get permanently banned. Permanently banned without any warning!!!!!! This is completely unfair and I would really like some help getting my account back.","replies":[{"poster":"Orange Caramel","date":"2017-02-26T10:42:00.243+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"What RIOT does wrong is they only show your comments in the transcript.

Is it because they are genuinely doing something with room for improvement, or are they not playing the way you *would like* them to play?\nMost often people that are giving advice are going off the second reason. If you want them to play more like you and abandon their own playstyle, don't do it. \n\nIt's pretty easy to gauge how people are going to react to criticism, and even when it isn't, it's always best to leave the tips till the post game. Why?\n\n* If you are typing, you aren't paying full attention to the game, possibly putting yourself and your team at a disadvantage.\n* Your teammate might tilt off the face of the earth (tbh I get super annoyed when people tell me how to play- they don't know my skill, my mindset, my limits)\n\n> ##The basics of giving advice:\n\n> **DO**\n> * Add the player after the game and talk to them about it then. One on one is best, and you are less likely to have toxins chime in\n> * Be nice about it, start off and finish what you're saying by pointing out things they did well, before suggesting one thing they could improve. \n> * Pick up on general things they could pick up on, rather than point out their specific mistakes. Chances are they could also point out a gazillion that you made. Best things are things you can link guides to, e.g: CS, warding, gank paths, builds, l2dodge\n> * Open a discourse, ask them what they think you could improve on.\n> * offer to play with them in norms or something so they can practice with at least one person on their side\n>\n>\n> **DO NOT**\n> * Point out their mistakes in game. Trust me, they already know. \n> * Harp on about one thing that happened early in the game for the next 20 minutes\n> * Flame them, blame them, generally be a ♥ ♥ ♥ ♥.\n> * Point out more than 1-2 mistakes\n> * Force your opinion down their throats. If they don't wanna hear it, just leave them be.","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Talon12","date":"2017-02-26T07:43:49.929+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"that 0.0006% is just a joke on rito part, the perma ban list is currently more around 13%","replies":[{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2017-02-26T07:46:05.195+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Source?
