I haven&#039;t play many ranked games (maybe like 30 or something) but I feel like I&#039;m stuck around silver. \r\n\r\nHave you guys got some suggestions that&#039;ll help me possibly climb or get better as a player?\r\n\r\nThanks :)","replies":[{"poster":"Maraudaur","date":"2016-08-09T07:17:34.367+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey mate,\n\nFirst of all welcome to the Ranked Climb =D prepare to test not only your skill but also your grit and resilience.\n\nFirst up check out these 2 great posts by our Instructor;\n\nhttp://boards.oce.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/gameplay-strategy/E5KPW5Qx-playing-like-a-god-but-still-cant-climb-part-1\n\nhttp://boards.oce.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/gameplay-strategy/xeKp58HJ-playing-like-a-god-but-still-cant-climb-part-2\n\nAlso I always highly suggest checking out these videos. Its great to see you are open to advice in your journey. I'll talk about two things to try and help you on the Ranked Ladder. Your game play and how to improve and your attitude towards the game.\n\nI'm going to start with attitude first because I believe this is one of the most important things to get right before you can improve and climb fast. \n\n**Attitude**\nWhen you are playing Ranked focus on your own game play, never look to push blame onto others. Unless you are literally Faker then there are probably things you could have done better to put your team in a position to win. Check out this video from Gbay99 - https://youtu.be/5MTO2a7ZFcc\n\nAlways stay positive, if you don't have something nice to say don't say it. If you are negative in your team chat not only will you add fire to the fuel but you could also potentially start your team on a downward spiral to fighting each other in chat instead of playing the game and trying to win. Remember League of Legends is a team game you have to work together as a team to win. #TeamWorkOP - https://youtu.be/ugXC7g3p0JU\n\n**Gameplay**\nYou've only just started on your ranked journey, there is going to be a lot to learn (hell I've played for 4 years and still have lots to learn). Don't get discouraged by losses and make sure you learn something from every death (why did you die? were you out of position? misjudged damage of opponent? etc) and make sure you always continue to learn about the game. There is a lot more to this game than just csing and fighting champions.\n\nCheck out this sick play list from UNSW LoL Society - https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL9RdXhXESRJzgY_SwHB8T-cZxXljWhQvz\n\nIt will teach you a lot about trading in lane, lane control, team fighting, and also how to use a lead.\n\nHope this all helps and good luck on the Rift!","replies":[{"poster":"Food Summoner","date":"2016-08-16T10:57:47.362+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thanks very much, this is very useful!","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Ace","date":"2016-08-10T04:32:13.620+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey,\nNot going to lie if you want to climb the best way is to just keep on playing and learning from each game. Grind until you get where you want, there is no easy way imo. Just don't flame and try your best to be supportive to your team regardless if they are nice or not, oh and if someone is aggravating you just mute them and unmute later in the game just incase they say something important relating to the game. Oh and if you haven't already try to practice more champs and get used to all the roles so regardless of what one you end up getting you can play it well.\nGood luck man!{{sticker:slayer-pantheon-thumbs}}","replies":[{"poster":"Food Summoner","date":"2016-08-16T10:58:24.902+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thanks, I've been trying to mute toxic players","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"dragon poo","date":"2016-08-10T18:20:50.943+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Make teams with tons of cc and a decent front line. have adc that either have insane damage, or reliable self peel, and try and get picks before fights. keep in mind that objectives win games, not kills.","replies":[]},{"poster":"kaboomblah","date":"2016-08-11T01:50:36.969+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Don't listen to any of this nonsense.
