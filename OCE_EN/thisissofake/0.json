It carried an immense great axe, lifting it and pressing it down with every step. The sun burned hot, and the sand carried on the wind to deliver a constant sting, but the figure seemed unaffected. Its jackal head was protected by glorious, golden armor, which seemed to have stayed perfect for millennia. The remainder of the wanderer&rsquo;s body was loosely draped in bandages, dragging behind it in the sand, yet they made no marks. The only footprints were made by the figure&rsquo;s three large claws and these eerily disappeared into the sands as it moved on. \n\nThe wanderer&rsquo;s name was Nasus, and he was walking to meet an ancient foe. One that had committed such a devastating act of treachery, that Nasus didn&rsquo;t only have to deliver punishment, but wanted to. \n\nNeeded to.\n\nHis aura shifted as he pondered on distant memories. Nasus focused on the magic around him to calm down. His eyes shone a powerful, bright blue as he saw it seep through the air, and cling to every grain of sand in the desert. In this, Nasus felt peace.\n\nSuddenly that peace collapsed as Nasus sensed a strong disturbance in the magic. He stopped in his tracks and took up an alert pose, tightened his grip on the great axe and slowed his breath to allow full concentration. Then he heard it. \n\nLying under the calm sound of the wind, was a deep, throaty hiss. Almost un-detectable. Slow and steady. Dangerous. The hiss was accompanied by a faint and stomachy growl. Something was hiding beneath the desert surface and Nasus recognized the sounds of its breathing. One breath came to an abrupt halt and Nasus instantly leapt into action.\n\nHe slammed the pommel of his great axe into the sand, creating a circle around him, and magic flew up around the circumference. Then Nasus leapt to the side just in time to dodge as a terrifying form burst from the ground and sent sand shooting in all directions. The creature was covered in scales and armor much like that of Nasus. It spun two times in the air before opening out to land. It was a large crocodile figure, donned in ancient armor and wielding a massive golden bat&rsquo;leth. It stared at Nasus with hatred glowing red in its eyes.\n\n&ldquo;Renekton,&rdquo; said Nasus, his voice was deep and gravelly. &ldquo;Never have I known you to hide and attack from behind.&rdquo;\n&ldquo;Never have you betrayed me!&rdquo; Renekton growled, as he leapt at Nasus again, performing his deadly spin technique with his large blade out in front.\n\nRenekton was much quicker and more agile than his brother and so Nasus had to rely on his magic to survive. He held his battle axe with his hands wide apart and with the center of the handle, he diverted the momentum of Renekton&rsquo;s spinning body to the left while side stepping to the right. Before his brother could leap back, Nasus cast another circle of spirit fire. He knew it would sap Renekton&rsquo;s energy and so he stayed where he held the advantage. He did not want to kill his brother, however this was only the pale shadow of the soul he once held dear. If there was even the slightest chance of bringing Renekton back from insanity, he would take it. Otherwise, a quick death was all the kindness he could show.\n\nJust as Nasus had predicted, Renekton leapt at him once more, immediately after landing from his first attack. It had been centuries since they last spoke, yet he still knew his brother like the back of his hand. \n\nHe swung his battle axe around his body to hit Renekton&rsquo;s side with the flat part of the axe, but the crocodile ended his leap short, and rolled on the ground to dodge the attack. He then proceeded to launch high in the air, swiveling his bat&rsquo;leth ferociously at Nasus&rsquo; face. After his swing had hit nothing but wind, Nasus only had enough time to lean back and narrowly escape the razor sharp edges of his brother&rsquo;s blade.\n\nRenekton landed in the sand three meters behind Nasus, who then turned to see him fist the ground in rage and yell out in agony. Nasus looked into his heart, and saw the anguish he had suffered through for centuries. He felt the betrayal. He felt the pain.\n&ldquo;Dear brother,&rdquo; he said softly, yet his voice carried far. &ldquo;Why do you feel this way?&rdquo;\nThen he felt the corrupt magic that shrouded Renekton&rsquo;s head. He had only a small encounter with the magic before, yet he would remember the taste for eternity. \n\nIt was Xerath&rsquo;s magic.\n\n&ldquo;YOU MADE ME THIS WAY!&rdquo; Renekton screamed. &ldquo;YOU TURNED YOUR BACK ON ME WHEN I NEED YOU! WE WERE SUPPOSED TO BE BROTHERS!&rdquo;\n&ldquo;I would never betray you brother. I always loved you. This is all Xerath. He has poisoned your mind-&rdquo;\n&ldquo;SHUT UP!&rdquo; Renekton&rsquo;s growl turned to a shout.\n\nHe couldn&rsquo;t take it, his mind was tearing itself apart and he couldn&rsquo;t tell which memories of his past were true, or lies. He clawed at his head trying to find answers. \n\n&ldquo;Let me help you,&rdquo; Nasus said, taking steps closer.\n&ldquo;NO!&rdquo; Renekton reacted wildly, flailing his bat&rsquo;leth around without his usual efficiency and Nasus took full advantage.\n\nHe swung his battle axe strong and hard and aimed directly for the weapon. A loud &lsquo;clang&rsquo; sounded, and suddenly Renekton&rsquo;s blade went flying out of his hand. Before he could do anything, Nasus had him pinned down in the sand. Their eyes both glowed with power. Red and blue. \n\n&ldquo;I never betrayed you,&rdquo; Nasus searched deep through his brother&rsquo;s soul to pick out the memory of the one day that changed everything.\n\n He let his brother see how Xerath had been too powerful for them to fight alone. He went deeper to find the sweet, childhood memories they shared.\nHe felt Renekton&rsquo;s body stop struggling and become calm. He saw the rage in Renekton&rsquo;s eyes leave, and he leant even closer.\n\n&ldquo;I have always loved you, brother&hellip;&rdquo;\n\n\n\n_P.S. there&#039;s about 1000 words so I hope you don&#039;t get too bored with reading it all :////_","replies":[{"poster":"Oneechan","date":"2016-07-10T09:19:20.476+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"...and then he stacked him.\nJokes.
