Apply anyway and we can negotiate which role you will have. \r\nI probably wont check this post again, but add me in-game (BurstFire301) and message me if interested.\r\nThis team isn't for someone who blames bad teams for their soloq rank. It's not for people who want to play for a few weeks and then stop showing up. This is a team for HARD WORKING people performing at the HIGHEST STANDARD who always AIM TO IMPROVE.\r\nHappy Holidays boyz :)","replies":[{"poster":"MadLifeJunior","date":"2014-12-18T23:32:53.611+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey there BurstFire301, \n\nI would just like to point out your Recruitment Criteria is incredibly harsh. Whilst I admit that you are recruiting for a \"PROFESSIONAL\" team in mind your requirements of at least 500 games a season (whilst not hard) and at least 4 hours a day beyond 5.30 EST seems a little steep. If you want a team like this I suggest looking at summoners you encounter during your solo queue adventure that you enjoy playing with and against with the skill set that you are looking for. This way the players you recruit you already have prior knowledge to and have a fairly similar play schedule to you. \n\nBut still. I wish you good luck on your endeavour. \n\nRegards,\nlols =)","replies":[]}]}
