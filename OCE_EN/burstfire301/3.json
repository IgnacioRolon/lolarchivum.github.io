I said everyone deserves a fair chance so if by me coming across as entitled means I feel I deserve an equal opportunity the same as anyone else then yes I do have a sense of entitlement as would anyone else, Lazy? Kinda being quick to judge ain't ya? If me feeling like I don't need to justify why I deserve a fair chance to gain access to a \"pro\" team by boasting and not by having my gameplay and mechanics or team communication skills observed is lazy then sure I guess I'm lazy, As for what I said you used my elo as an excuse to dismiss me so before you start calling me or my comments \"rude\" or \"unfounded\" at the very least realise you are such a hypocrite as you yourself have done just that with your own comments like for example \"If you went into a part-time job at mcdonalds with that attitude, I don't think you would be offered a job\" I mean seriously at least I had some evidence to support what I said you just blatantly assumed who I am and how I act in person and used it to insult me, then there's this statement \"I'm a perfect example of game knowledge (Yea its spelt with a d) vs shit mechanics. Basically, I have 100's of people to talk to every day I don't have time to deal with people who don't respect that.\" Basically you are full of yourself you are in Gold 5, I'm in Gold 5 and I know people who are in lower ranks who are probably better and smarter game wise than the both of us combined and like I said before you have no idea who I am or how I play so there is no excuse for you to just dismiss me like a low elo vagabond when we are of both the same skill level. Finally \"I really don't want you to hate me\" again are you serious? I'll admit I can be a bit of a dickhead at times but I never hate people sure I hate the way they act and I certainly hate the way you act and so long as you keep up this attitude of not giving everyone their fair chance I would never even consider you being a viable option as a coach for anyone. Sure I have my problems but I'm still willing to give everyone a fair shot to see if they can pull their weight.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"GigaPube","date":"2015-11-12T13:18:07.745+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"stupidest sport/esport name ive ever heard. honestly, being srs, like honestly, do you truly really honestly know what that means without having to look it up? \"HURRDURRR PEARMOOTAYSHUN I LYK MOOTANTS DEY KOOL LYK ZOMBIES I PLAY DA ZOMBIE KILL ON XBAX I PWN DA N00BS GEEGEE TWOEZY\"","replies":[{"poster":"BurstFire301","date":"2015-11-14T04:12:16.288+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"Said the GigaPUBE. was the KAPPA implied?","replies":[{"poster":"GigaPube","date":"2015-11-14T13:59:31.696+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"keppu","replies":[{"poster":"BurstFire301","date":"2015-11-14T14:34:40.949+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"<3","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"DanieI Morcombe","date":"2015-11-12T11:02:36.940+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Gold 5, wants to compete in OPL. \n\nPEPE!","replies":[{"poster":"BurstFire301","date":"2015-11-14T04:11:58.620+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"i was going to manage the team. please familiarize yourself with eSport structure please.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"ayaya cutie","date":"2015-11-12T21:59:20.402+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"nice me me","replies":[{"poster":"BurstFire301","date":"2015-11-14T04:11:50.041+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"Unfortunately, we will not be holding tryouts any more.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"nightmaresxd","date":"2015-11-13T04:10:02.771+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I guess I will have a shot at this :)","replies":[{"poster":"BurstFire301","date":"2015-11-14T04:10:16.547+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"Unfortunately we've decided to postpone tryouts indefinitely at this point.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Lord Kylar Alice","date":"2015-11-12T09:52:08.779+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Dang gotta prove you're worth the time of a Gold V.","replies":[{"poster":"BurstFire301","date":"2015-11-14T04:11:17.690+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I was going to be the manager of the team not a player. we will not be continuing with tryouts at the moment anyway.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Roguestoney","date":"2015-11-12T23:25:04.941+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Best Burrito AU,realm=OCE,application-id=mR0UmRrp,discussion-id=QfO99Pk7,comment-id=0002,timestamp=2015-11-12T09:52:08.779+0000)\n>\n> Dang gotta prove you're worth the time of a Gold V.\n\nThat hurts bro :-( :p","replies":[]}]}]}
