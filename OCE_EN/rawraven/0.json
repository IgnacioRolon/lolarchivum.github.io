But this doesn't help A & B in most cases.\r\n\r\nPlease simply make all messages return from the server so that everyone knows who called the position first.\r\nIt would avoid so many arguments before the game even starts.\r\n\r\nThanks, RR","replies":[{"poster":"HORSE OF FORCE","date":"2015-03-26T10:02:58.885+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The chat system could do with an overhaul. It's still basically the same from when it was first coded. One thing that could be implemented is chat during loading. You won't have to hold all strategy talk in champion select, then, and it would relieve so much pressure, as well as pass the time.\n\nAlas, this probably isn't the board for this sort of talk.
