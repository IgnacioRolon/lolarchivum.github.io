I assume you are talking about Blind and if that is the case you are not really losing anything, you are not going down in rank or losing LP. Its just a loss and you might get a bit tilted that's all. You still gain exp and honor whether you win or lose.\n\nI also don't see how playing against a 5 man premade is much different then playing against non-premade. If your team has good map awareness and communication within chat and pings you will do fine.\n\nAgain if it is just norms it doesn't hurt anyone.","replies":[]}]}
