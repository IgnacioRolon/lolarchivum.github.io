I tried changing hotkeys, quickcast, etc and couldn&#039;t get it to stop then today I was talking with some friends and they were all complaining about the same thing. How do we change this feature back to how it used to be? It&#039;s really annoying when you&#039;ve spent years forming a mechanical memory because it&#039;s an automatic thing you do without thinking. My cs per game has dropped off SUBSTANTIALLY since this change. I&#039;m still able to hold the same high silver/low gold (I know that&#039;s not good, not claiming to be pro) rank on most my accounts but my cs per game has dropped to what I&#039;d consider bronze level. Where is the option to change this mechanic back to how it used to be?","replies":[{"poster":"Gehirn","date":"2018-06-03T04:59:38.409+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"As Hounorsboy mentioned, this sounds related to the attack move on cursor option. You can find it under the GAME section in settings.\n\nWith it turned off, you just walk towards the location that you a-clicked to, attacking every target on the way starting with the closest target first.\n\nWith it turned on, the cursor searches for something in the area around it when you a-click. If something is in that area, rather than moving and attacking every target on the way, you walk towards the target found in the area around the cursor and attack that. The change you're feeling is due to the area around the cursor that searches for a target being expanded slightly [in patch 8.7](https://oce.leagueoflegends.com/en/news/game-updates/patch/patch-87-notes#patch-crest-of-cinders), so you might a-click next to a far off target and accidentally prioritize attacking that thing over what is in front of you more frequently now.\n\nIf all you want is for a-click to walk and attack everything on the way, I recommend turning attack move on cursor off.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Dave311","date":"2018-06-03T14:40:34.656+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Honestly I thought I had tried that both on and off, but what you're describing sounds like my problem exactly so I must have made a mistake.
