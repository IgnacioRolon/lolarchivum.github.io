RQ a game and come back to gloat only to see your team is winning? \"Ohhh hey sorry guys my power went out I'm back now\". You'd be getting credit for a win that wasn't yours. \n\nProportionately speaking with a mostly stable connection and reliable pc (which is generally expected of anyone playing ranked in an MMO) the accidental or unavoidable leaves are going to be far outweighed by the potential abuse cases if Riot left it a free for all.\n\nAs for your ban, by which I presume you mean a LeaverBuster, you wouldn't have received one if you didn't have a history of leaving games. You either leave reasonably often, in which case you've used up all your free passes, or your computer and/or net aren't reliable enough to keep you in game at which point you've still used up all your free passes and should really be avoiding ranked until you can fix it.\n\nI don't know the specifics of your circumstances of course, but you don't get LeaverBusters for one, or even a few leaves.\n\nRemember that your leaves don't just affect you, they affect everyone in every game you leave from. Even if you only leave for 5 minutes, especially if it's early, you've just made that game exponentially harder for your team, and a lot less competitive for the enemy.","replies":[]}]}
