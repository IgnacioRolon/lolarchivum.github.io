Being banned for scripts or other third-party software use is pretty common among compromised accounts.\n\nHe should submit specifically an [Account Recovery ticket](https://support-leagueoflegends.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/requests/new?ticket_form_id=72416) to player support (if he didn't already, they will direct him to do so, so it will skip that step in the process). He will have to be logged out of his account to do so and will have to be able to answer most of the questions asked. \n\nIf he feels he hasn't answered enough of them, any information that is *unique* to the account but *not visible* on the account is useful in this process, though the older the information the better (and obviously excluding any information that would have been visible at the time of the compromise).\n\nOnce the account is recovered and secured, the suspension will generally be removed. Be aware there are exceptions to this, primarily when account sharing has been involved but others as well.\n\nAs for support not responding to the ticket, not sure. It's possible he was redirected to an AR ticket and didn't realise, or something happened with the ticket queue, or he was meant to get a redirect from BlitzBot that didn't go through properly, not sure.

Not playing any of the same champs? If you were trying to avoid a 3rd party ban on your account would you not take measure to make it look like you weren't the one playing? Would you not play those games in an internet cafe or some such so you could make the claim that it wasn't your normal location?\n\nThat's not to say it won't be taken into consideration, but that it can't be used as actual *proof* that the account was compromised since it could just as easily be your brother trying to dodge the ban.\n\nThe things they can use as proof, clearly just aren't there, or aren't there in a manner that convincingly suggests a compromise of the account, even upon multiple investigations.\n\nThat doesn't necessarily mean it *wasn't* a compromise but being so unable to prove that it was is unusual, and they can't reasonably give back every account that *could* have been compromised, or everyone would just spoof it to avoid bans.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Project Xayah","date":"2020-01-10T05:49:06.600+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Exarch Leona,realm=OCE,application-id=ElA0rvVL,discussion-id=7leoBmhb,comment-id=00000001000000000000000000000000,timestamp=2020-01-10T04:03:36.797+0000)\n>\n> \"Someone accessed your computer to get the ban\"\n> How is that possible when there is no computer to access?\n\nHaving looked at the provided screenshots, I think you may be misunderstanding what's being said, specifically regarding the support agents statement that \"either [your brother] or a person with access to [your brother's] computer picked up the ban\".\n\nFrom the information shown, none of the multiple support agents who reviewed the case identified any sign of a compromise on the account, and the specific statement (as above) seems to suggest that they did identify the computer that accessed the account at the time of the offence(s) as the same computer that is normally used to access the account.\n\nThat then presents the possibility that someone who is close to your brother in real life gained physical access to their computer (possibly their old computer?), accessed their LoL account using that computer (whether or not your brother knew about and/or authorised that access), and engaged in activities that resulted in the account being banned. At that point, many of the normal metrics that Riot would normally use to identify an account compromise (such as identifying the specific computer(s) used to access the account) are no longer valid options, and so they may have been unable to identify enough distinctive information to confirm a compromise occurred.\n\nUltimately, I'm not seeing any evidence of comments such as, or similar to, the ones you've previously claimed in this thread have come from the support agents, and nothing to suggest that the support agents did anything short of continued attempts to verify nothing was missed relating to the case.\n\nUnfortunately, it seems this is the final result of the case, with no new evidence or angles to explore.","replies":[{"poster":"Exarch Leona","date":"2020-01-10T16:45:05.111+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"I gave general summaries.\nThe computer being \"used\" as suggested died 4 years ago, not long after his last game as Rengar (4 days in fact. That's on me, I never got around to fixing it mostly because I had my own things to attend to), yet there is 3 years worth of other games. But only the recent games clearly were looked at. And when, and IF, looked at, they'd see the recent activity from the account compared to when he actually played, they are not at all remotely similar.\nSo instead of informing my brother that the account had been compromised, they've just banned it ant not even given him a chance to reclaim it. \n\nThe only other PC in the house was MINE, playing MY games and my mothers laptop. A laptop we could not use. \nBut Riot couldn't be bothered to ask that because that would, I don't know, be basic information worth gathering?\n\nThere's heaps of angles to explore, but Riot just wanna keep the money that he had put into the game. \n\nLook, I'm more than happy to do the work for them since they've made it insanely clear that they do not want to do any of it, but I'd need access to whatever \"evidence\" they claim to have.

Based on the statements from the support agents shown in the screenshots, that seems to be the most likely possibility for why they haven't been able to confirm a compromise. It could also be possible (though arguably less likely) that a different computer on the same connection (i.e. your home wifi, presumably) was used to access the account, but I would think they'd be able to identify if it was a different computer in that case.\n\n> Riot couldn't be bothered to ask that because that would, I don't know, be basic information worth gathering?\n\nIt would also require them to take those statements at face value, which isn't something the support agents are inclined to do, considering that a *lot* of genuinely toxic users would love for them to do so. I'm honestly not sure how they might respond to any tangible evidence you could provide to support those kinds of statements, but perhaps it would be a good idea to converse with the support agents to see if there is a way to support such an \"extension\" of the investigation.\n\nI'm inclined to think they probably won't go along with it, it's a remarkable amount of effort to go to beyond their standard procedures, but it is possible (however unlikely) that you *may* be able to pursue other avenues in that manner (no guarantees, though). It's something you'd need to discuss with someone from Riot, whether that be a support agent or someone else.\n\nWhile it's *not* something I'd recommend, if you were able to gather significant evidence to support your statements, you may wish to seek legal aid (i.e. a lawyer) and pursue legal action. It's not something to be taken lightly, obviously, but ultimately it would be your decision if it's something you wish to pursue. I honestly doubt there would be any legal precedent, but I'm also not a lawyer and don't know the full scope of the situation. The main thing I'd see as a \"barrier\" in that sense would be that it's clearly stated in the ToU that Riot reserves the right to ban an account for any or no reason, which is likely something that they would use in such a situation. Ultimately, though, legal action is always a significant commitment, and you will want to be fully confident before proceeding, otherwise it may bite you in the ass, and no one wants that.\n\nWhen all is said and done, I'm completely confident Riot have done everything they can to try and verify a compromise occurred in this case, but are simply unable to find sufficient evidence to prove that. It definitely sucks when this happens, but there are very rare cases where \"false positives\" can't be proven, this may be one of them. I honestly can't think of anything else that may help.","replies":[{"poster":"WarriorRio","date":"2020-01-11T04:32:33.853+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Actual account owner here (the one that got banned)\n\nSomeone accessing the computer im using now is an impossibility.
