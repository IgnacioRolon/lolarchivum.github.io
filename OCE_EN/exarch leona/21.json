Connection or computer or life issues happen, everyone knows and accepts that. It is precisely why you don't get LeaverBusted for first or even first few leaves.\n\nFor you to have received a LeaverBuster you have to have had a recent or extensive history of leaves. If those were a result of pc issues, you have a responsibility to try to determine why the issue happens, rather than just continuing to ruin the game for other players despite knowing the issue exists. If those previous leave were afks, and it was only a benign reason that triggered the LB, then I think it should be pretty clear why and how you've used up your free passes.\n\nYou have to remember that your leaves, whatever the reason for them, don't only affect you, and while Riot is happy to give some free passes for occasional issues, consistent ruining of the player experience naturally has to come with some sort of consequence.","replies":[]}]}
