And I get that, so many of you are far from bright that even darkness is brighter than half you things. \r\n\r\nBut does anyone actually take the time to learn the champs after a rework?\r\nI mean, I dun goofed and played vlad unaware of a rework since I saw nothing anywhere about it. But the big ones like Darius (since he had changes), Skarnsy, Taric (the main one right now since NO ONE i&#039;ve come across today seems to know how he works), Mord and so on and so forth. \r\n\r\nIt seems to cause physical brain damage to me to get other players to learn how champs that work well together. 2 people today (1 duo, 1 random) actually understood what to do after like 3-4 minutes into laning with me. \r\n\r\nRiot, I get you&#039;re condoning trolling and all this season, but you REALLY have to address this problem. Its making climbing outta hell for the 4th time a real f***ing s*** to do. To the point taking a massive s*** is easier to do than carry the crap you give me. \r\n\r\nI&#039;d say peace out, but most of you belong in concentration camps from back in 1934 to 1945. \r\n\r\nThats all.","replies":[{"poster":"GigaPube","date":"2016-05-08T17:25:43.760+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"my head was not physically hurt. if you wanna \"climb out of hell\", start by being better than them. start by reading the patch notes, have you ever heard of them? if you havent, you will remain in \"hell\" or you will wait to get lucky from other people that carry. or, anything else can happen, oce bronze, definitely the lowest skill level of players on the planet undeniably, sorry. highest percentage of bronze means the highest percentage of the most inadequate players. but hey we're known for being really laidback and chill about our work ethic, cant blame us. reading patch notes? how does that get us more pentakills on instalock riven?","replies":[]},{"poster":"Requiemsfire","date":"2016-05-08T16:55:38.649+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Maybe you could read the patch notes?","replies":[]}]}
