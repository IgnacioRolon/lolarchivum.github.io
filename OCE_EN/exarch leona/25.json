They are your SUPPORTS. \r\nNot theres, not them. \r\nYOURS.\r\n\r\nSeriously, this is getting insane. Stop leaving me to 1v2 the lane because you're scared of easy kills. \r\n\r\nSincerely, \r\nSomeone sick of solo laning while you afk at the turret.","replies":[{"poster":"Nightjar","date":"2019-05-23T23:48:48.017+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"to be fair, a comment on yuumi players;\nalot of your power is loaded into your passive and the ability for you to go perma zhonias basically at a moment's notice with your w,\nwhich means that you should split your time between autoing and tanking hits separate, and combining and providing heals, shields and your q slow as equally as you can manage.\n\nI see alot of Yuumi players just stick to their adc in combined form, which basically makes them a sometimes heal, a little bit of a slow (the q doesn't do much damage anyway, as hard as it is to dodge) and rarely an ult.\nThe whole point of a support in botlane, regardless of which champion they are, is another health bar, another slew of abilities, and alot more harass. Alot of the early damage a ranged support has is through auto trading when the enemy ad tries to last hit or the enemy support tries to harass your AD.\nIf you stay in combined form you can't auto, and you won't get your quite considerable passive shield. Swapping between forms and passing the shield and heals along to your adc by flicking back and forth between forms and throwing out autos can actually make Yuumi somewhat formidable in extended trades, despite her low champion power atm.","replies":[]}]}
