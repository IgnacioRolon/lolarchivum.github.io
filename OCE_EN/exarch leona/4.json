I'll usually give my adc time to prove if they are reasonable or a muppet and then adjust my strategy accordingly, e.g. roam if they are a muppet. As support usually I'll have a day with 8 losses in a row, and then a day with 8 wins in a  row.

That sucks :( \n\n But please, don't use trolls as the reason you can't climb. As I mentioned above, the trolls will cancel themselves out. _**You're the only common factor in all your games.

Giving people free wins makes climbing a little bit trivial. This would definitely be a solution though. **Riot**'s probably a little careful with it, because it's not the healthiest of designs.\n\n+ I'm sure **Riot** would like to see trolls and feeders entirely removed from the game as well, but sadly that's probably not going to be achievable ever. \n\n **That doesn't mean Riot is doing nothing.** We recently had improvements for AFKs with /remake, and **Riot** is still hard at work on the tribunal which will help crackdown on trolling and intentional feeding.

Sorry you misinterpreted it this way.\n\nAs you rightly pointed out a few of the systems do have flaws. They are not perfect. If you have ideas on how to improve them without side effects, I'm sure they'd be happy to hear it. \n\nJust because trolls still exist, doesn't mean Riot condones trolling though.
