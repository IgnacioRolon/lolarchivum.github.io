This is why we implemented a easy to abuse AFK system. Now that they can&#039;t afk (and if they do, they won&#039;t get punished HOORAY), they can just feed and ruin the game as a whole. So we&#039;ve changed the ranking elos to be reversed (don&#039;t ask why, it was the communities idea).  Because we&#039;ve done this, we can ruin our own game, piss off the community greatly, enforce trolling while pretending to be against it and still suck the community off all at the same time.&quot;\r\n\r\nSeriously though. \r\n\r\nThe last few days has been nothing but troll after troll after troll after troll.
