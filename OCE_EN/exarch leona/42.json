They're only out for themselves. \r\nRito, for the love of god, stop giving me ADCs that do nothing, you effectively queue me into 4v6 games. \r\n\r\nHow tf people can actually believe AFK farming wins games is beyond me.","replies":[{"poster":"DarkShade918","date":"2019-03-22T07:03:35.327+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"As a support main i agree with this, but also disagree with the comment about afk farming.\n\nYour adc (providing they're winning the farm game) can turn the tide of a game, especially if they're an entire item up on the enemy adc and we peel them accordingly. \n\nAs a side role top laner, who solely believes in AFK farming/Splitting to win games, this is a simple \"I have more gold, therefore do more damage (or tank more) than my opponent will ever be able to do\" situation. Applies as much to splitter's as it does to adcs (Who understand their role)\n\nBoth of these strategies require you to actually win the farm game though, so i see where you're coming from about adc's being useless, especially in plat or lower, where adcs barely amass 80cs/min. \n\nIts also notable, that adcs below plat have 0 positioning skill, and thus often lose fights just by being a few units short of their necessary placement on the map. But we also need to factor in, not all supports can support (most are autofilled), those that know how to support know their role (usually) either to peel or to set up. This makes adcs less likely to pay attention to their supports, because maybe they had 20 games with autofilled supports who did nothing but fail them. \n\nThe solution. Stop autofilling people, so actual supports get their role, and adc's don't always get some trashbag who has no idea how to play.","replies":[{"poster":"Exarch Leona","date":"2019-03-22T10:28:16.776+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":">Your adc (providing they're winning the farm game)\n\nThey even fail to farm. \nThey're usually down about 10-30 farm when laning phase ends.\n\n>those that know how to support know their role (usually) either to peel or to set up.\n\nI can set up the easiest and cleanest kills, even if I have to sac myself for the adc to get a quadra early game (yeah, im the kinda support that gets a perma 4man bot game)\n\n>adc's don't always get some trashbag who has no idea how to play\n\nIm a support main, more than often, its the adcs that have less than 0 idea on what they are doing.","replies":[]}]}]}
