Afks. And int feeders. More often than not, my adc afks from about the 5ish minute mark along side the afk farming jungler. \r\n\r\nBesides Veiger and Brand, what other champs can I play that supply enough damage early that I can keep going solo once my trash adc has left?\r\nBecause, like I said, im ALWAYS seem to lose a player about the 5-10 minute mark and it&#039;s starting to irk me to no end. And because no one seems to want to address the int feeding trolling trash behaviour, i need new ideas.","replies":[{"poster":"Spiral Zetsu","date":"2017-11-20T06:01:21.767+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":2,"body":"I'm not sure if you've quite grasped the concept of 'support'?\nI think the lane you're looking for might be: **mid**","replies":[{"poster":"Exarch Leona","date":"2017-11-20T07:32:09.206+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":2,"body":"\"Maining support means you support someone\"\nYes, lemme support a solo lane. \nGenius.","replies":[{"poster":"Spiral Zetsu","date":"2017-11-20T09:58:14.241+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":1,"body":"Yes maining support does mean you 'support' someone.\n\nBut from what you've said it doesn't sound like you're 'supporting' anyone!\n\nYou're basically calling your adc trash, that you do all the damage in the lane, and now you want champs that can solo lane and have tons of early damage to carry that \"solo\" lane, because your adc is farming (literally the one thing they are supposed to do early game?)\n\n\"Basically solo lane, insane damage, doing all the work, tons of early damage\" nothing about that has literally anything to do with 'supporting' at all, you have just described mid lane. even the champs you use Veigar and Brand, aren't supports they're mid champs...","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Akkordian Zoeve","date":"2017-11-20T08:10:14.849+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Sona, Annie, Zyra, Vel'Koz, Karma.","replies":[{"poster":"Exarch Leona","date":"2017-11-27T04:29:03.192+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Didnt sona get a nerf?\nLike legit question, i thought she did.","replies":[{"poster":"Akkordian Zoeve","date":"2017-11-27T07:03:18.036+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"She did, but she's still really strong.
