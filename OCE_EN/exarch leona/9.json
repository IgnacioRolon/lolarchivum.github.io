If not I can also suggest going to op.gg, search for \"evelyn\", look up the current top players and then in the \"pro matches\" drop down see if you can match up pro eve games with top rated eve players!\n\nGood luck!","replies":[{"poster":"Exarch Leona","date":"2019-09-30T10:19:24.836+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Ima try both of these, hopefully make progress.\n\nbest way i learn though is through communication while playing. \nlearned how to Warwick that way after so  many games of trial and error (which was mostly error so error and error maybe?)","replies":[{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2019-09-30T10:23:39.221+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Many people learn much better by just doing the thing with feedback. If that sounds like you (certainly sounds like me), it might be worth trying to find a willing higher or similarly ranked player who plays Evelynn (or even just squishy assassin junglers), and simply play with them or have them spectate.\n\nPersonally, while I find tips here and there that help, most of my learning comes from in the moment assessment and correction, and simple trial and error.","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"JimmyJJones","date":"2019-11-30T04:29:37.623+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Try watching some KingStix. He is a really good evelynn player and he uploads videos on youtube regularly. Otherwise, make sure you are taking the right runes (ignite, sudden impact, celerity, waterwalking) and builds. Good luck.","replies":[]}]}
