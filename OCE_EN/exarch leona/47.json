Overall it will be balanced, but sometimes you'll be that poor sod who gets nothing or that lucky sod who gets everything.\n\n>Opponents cap is ALWAYS higher (as in while my cap is 5 or 6 champs, they get +1).\n\nThis is all gold management. Remember that interest is a thing, and that if you can't level up with the gold you've got it's better to save it and get interest until you can get all the EXP in one hit (yay maths).\n\n>Opponents always seem to have gear + extra gear, while I only get whats at the start or pre equipped.\n\nIf you're losing to, or not killing all of the minion waves, you're going to have less chance at items. Minions, starters, and the round robin are the only way to get items. Again though, this comes down to RNG, some people will get max drops of minions, others will get none.\n\n>Their damage is usually x2 what I'm dealing too.\n\nRace and Class (e.g Demon Sorcerer) bonuses are big. 3 Assassins means more crit, 2 Brawlers means they have more health etc. Don't underestimate them. A 2-star unit is also going to be doing way more work than 2 1 star units.\n\nThis is all about efficiency, matching up as much as you can and starring up your units wherever possible. It's also about placement. E.G If you're vsing a lot of assassins you need to have a front-liner or two at the back, or they'll just tear through your units.\n\n>Adding that when you get to pick a champ from the centre stage, you're not always gonna get that champ.\nJust now, picks pyke, somehow gets reksai\n\nYou get the first unit you *touch*, not the unit you click on.\n\n>Morde doesnt seem to attack after his first kill\n\nI've seen units stall when an enemy dies when the positioning is awkward, usually they sort themselves out. If Morde isn't attacking at all, it's a straight-up bug and you should bug report it. This is, after all, a live test not a finished and completely polished product.","replies":[{"poster":"Exarch Leona","date":"2019-07-01T10:26:04.302+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":">You get the first unit you touch, not the unit you click on.\n\nCept, I did touch Pyke.

If you were pushing it for time it's also possible the timer ran out and you were given a random unit. It's also entirely possible it was just a bug in an alpha state gamemode.\n\nI have also experienced champions stalling. I had one round where all three of my units left and the enemy's one stalled and so I lost health in a draw. Again, alpha state. There will be bugs, and you should report them when they happen.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"WalkThePlankFool","date":"2019-07-19T09:22:01.425+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":2,"body":"have not been on the boards for such a long time but after my tft experience i feel i have to comment. the game is a complete mess. to say it needs a miracle to fix would be an understatement. you can try to play the game smart but its all irrelevant when someone has 3 complete items while you have a cloak and chain-mail. it feels like you are playing a league of legends game  where someone randomly gets gifted 5 k gold at the start. i wont be playing riots trash games anymore. im sick of league and this is the final nail in the coffin for me. does anyone even play test this shit before they release it.","replies":[{"poster":"Legendary koekje","date":"2019-07-21T14:08:11.157+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"it a game of luck you get items or you dont get items you get the champs that have or not","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Effwhy","date":"2019-06-29T07:53:08.899+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":2,"body":"I feel like this might not be the game-mode for you...","replies":[{"poster":"Exarch Leona","date":"2019-07-01T10:24:14.941+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"I feel like this has to be bait.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Socon","date":"2019-06-28T01:51:31.134+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":2,"body":"Dont try to force a team comp, roll with wjat you're given, manage gold wisely.
