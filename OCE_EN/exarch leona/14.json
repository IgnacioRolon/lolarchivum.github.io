And I know this is going to be downvoted as hell because facts upset you all, but SOMEONE has to be saying it.\r\n\r\nI got on a winning streak on Lux, because need dem damages baaaaaby. \r\nGet to promos and then, it starts. \r\nThe first game had 2 dumbasses legitimately believe feeding and AFKing would win the game, and someone that outright refused to communicate leaving me to solo 3 lanes. \r\nIn a 3 lane game. \r\nYeah, you read that right. \r\n\r\nNow, lost my promos, because the weaponized mental handicap degeneracy that clearly is my team and I'm being punished for that BS.\r\nOh I'm sorry, I didn't know feeding and afking would win games, hol' up while I make an alt account, do the EXACT same BS on that one and watch as I get banned on it because \"IT NU TOOLOORATED HUUUUURRRRRRRR\"\r\n\r\nThen just now, decide to go someone else. \r\nHOW\r\nTHE\r\n\r\nHow do people in gold/plat NOT KNOW that Zils ults a rez?\r\nAre you people brain dead?\r\nOne tricks?\r\nHardcore mentally handicapped?\r\n\r\nHol' up we aint done yet. \r\n\r\nPeople are AFKing, troll picking, kicking people outta lanes for lulz, inting, trolling in game and just ruining everything and it's insane. \r\n\r\nEven if you report this behaviour, you wanna know what happens?\r\nAbsolutely nothing. \r\nYou can report the one twat every game you get with them, and they'll just keep getting away with it and doing it again, and again, and again, and again, and again. Why? Because ruining the game IS NOT against the rules. Calling it out is. Telling people to stop is. Telling people to focus is. But ruining it? Nah bruh, different play styles, it aight. \r\n\r\nIma wait for the people who I was with games in with to pop up and go \"REEEEEEEEEEE DAT AINT TRUUUUUUUUU REEEEE\" and provide some kinda verbal diarrhea and miss literally EVERYTHING they should be telling people just so they can be that \"saint\" (seriously, if you had these people, you'd bash your head against the desk wondering why they weren't put down sooner, and I don't mean in the insulted way)\r\n\r\nLook, yeah, I'm no better, I miss skill shots, but I hit more than I miss at least. \r\n\r\nRiot, you REALLY needa pull your finger out, you can not keep turning a blind eye, the volunteers can't keep jerking y'all off because you can't do wrong, and players can't keep sayin \"dere nuttin wron\", especially when you have multiple threads like this, many people notice it, and when many people constantly say it.\r\n\r\nIt's facts at this point, and that it's constantly avoided EVERY Q &amp; A thing you do (which im convinced is just Riot employees asking and answering). \r\nIma leave yall to deny the truth, yall have a good weekend.","replies":[]}
