Nothing. \r\n\r\nBUT, and here&#039;s the kicker, if I wanna leave because i&#039;ve been flamed or have an ADC trolling because &quot;LULZ ITZ BRUNZ/SALVERZ&quot; im punished while the flamer gets away with being a piece of crap. \r\n\r\nYeah, I know, I &quot;complain&quot; (I don&#039;t get how calling out people out is bad. I mean, you dont call a spade a fork do you? Spades a spade.) a lot. But this is ridiculous. Seriously. Why is trolling, ruining games, flaming, afking, abuse and all that crap ok for others, but as soon as someones over that in 1 game, they&#039;re a god damn tyrant?\r\n\r\nJust, think about that before the down votes and replies. (lel, who am i kidding, in this community? Higher chance of being gifted a skin I want from a random than people thinking something through).\r\n\r\nJust some food for thought. \r\n{{sticker:zombie-brand-mindblown}} \r\n\r\n\r\nINB4 ABUSE THE DUDE WHERE HE AINT LYING.","replies":[{"poster":"TimingOfLords","date":"2017-08-10T04:17:29.594+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'm not really sure what your point is. Are you complaining because you report people and they're not punished, whereas if you afk/leave a game and get punished it's unfair?\n\nWhatever the reason is, if you afk or leave a game, you should be punished. If your internet crashes (and it doesn't do it often), then that's just unlucky. Take the loss and move forward. If your internet is unreliable, don't play ranked. That's your own fault if you disconnect from games and get a ban. If people on your team are trolling and there is absolutely no way to win the game (2 afks and a feeder, for example), then you might as well just mess around and have fun in the game. Just take the loss.\n\nMy point is, people are going to do what they feel is fun. Some people play ranked in order to climb, other people play ranked because they can. Some people find it fun to troll, others don't. However, there is absolutely no excuse to afk or feed in a game just because you're being flamed or not enjoying it anymore. If you're being flamed, mute whoever is flaming you. Most of the time, people will type '/muteall' at the beginning of the game so no one can say anything tilting to them.\n\nAgain, I may have misunderstood your point, but my interpretation of what you were saying is that you feel it's justified to afk or leave a game because you're being flamed or your team is just toxic in general, but at the same time, it's not okay for anyone on your team to afk or leave a game. That's just hypocrisy.","replies":[]}]}
