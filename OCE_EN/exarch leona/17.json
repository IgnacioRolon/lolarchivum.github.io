Funny why?\r\nBecause where was the lie? There wasn&#039;t one, yet it&#039;s titled don&#039;t be a jerk (funny coming from Riots mouth considering they sit there going &quot;What way can we screw over the community today&quot;).\r\nPoor as form from them. On par with femtard/SJW arguments. \r\n\r\nLets point out their little board mod slaves now.\r\nHands down, some of the most blind people around. They argue there is absolutely nothing wrong with the community with no evidence yet when evidence provided, it gets down voted.\r\n\r\nWhat I find amusing as all hell though is Ritos &quot;Summoner Code&quot; which clearly needs to be re-written to fit the community that it&#039;s currently looming over.\r\nBe nice, respectful and play fair.\r\nFunny that. The community gives BLMs a run for their money in terms of degeneracy.\r\nYou&#039;d expect a good laugh here and there if your groups right?\r\nLOLNOPE. \r\nOnly thing funny is the attitude. \r\nWhile it states in summery, being respectful, the average comment is &quot;F*** YOU F***ING C***&quot; all over a kill or missed ult. Today alone, I had some ball fondler rage quit because he missed 1 Jhin bullet.\r\n\r\nWhy even queue if you were gonna troll?\r\nSince riot refuse to clean up the community, we go to naming and shaming, which is magically wrong. Probably because it means to we Riots work for them, which would explain why they get triggered on par with Anita S. (person, not a champ RITO).\r\n\r\nAnd whats funny with that?\r\nThe fact that if you play and want to climb, repeat a famous quote OR agree with a team mate, you get punished. But you can troll and ruin a game and riot will give you a handjob rather than punish you. BS right?\r\nPunish people that enjoy it but give a nice wet BJ to people that ruin it? Kind of makes the summoner code redundant don&#039;t you think? Whats the point of it?\r\nKind of discriminating on players that are right don&#039;t you think?\r\n\r\nSo trolling, ruining the game, feeding, bring a d*** is perfectly alright, following the summoner code isn&#039;t though?\r\nFlamings alright?\r\nCarrying games, going B when almost dead and supportings wrong?\r\nGiving suggestions and learning new champs is wrong?\r\n\r\n Rito clearly need to work on their company/systems/mod selection criteria BEFORE releasing new things. \r\n\r\nThis will be downvoted to hell like all my posts calling riot and the community out. Why?\r\nBecause deep down, you know i&#039;m right, but the big black d*** labeled RITO in your mouth makes you say no.\r\n\r\nIn the famous words that got me a chat restriction:\r\nLEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEROY \r\nJEEEEEENKINS","replies":[{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2016-12-09T05:31:53.977+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"Your comment was removed because of the \"electroshock therapy\" comment as was explained to you in the deletion notice.
