People just don't report enough. Pretty much all my friends who play LoL won't report just because they can't be bothered or something silly like that. If everyone on both teams reported the player who was toxic or feeding internally then a lot more would get done I am sure.","replies":[]},{"poster":"BlasingNemo","date":"2016-06-28T11:38:52.453+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hi just had a really really bad troll dying every 70-80 secs she was griefing verbal abuse my team the whole game and bragging in chat  telling the other team free win and at the end after the enivitable loss Annie confidently told my team to suck a dick that nothing was going to happen  I would very much like to know this person gets banned not warned and there not the only troll who griefs the team in chat then brags confidently that nothing will happen can you please make an announcement that your cracking down on this behaviour because not only do they think they get away with it they're emboldened by lol doing nothing about it and they go for broke in ruining the game. It's not fun please tell me something is being done.","replies":[{"poster":"Exarch Leona","date":"2016-07-04T09:45:29.813+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Nothing is being done. \nRiot decided it would be cool to give me warning/punishment when calling them (both Rito AND the community) out. \n\nThey refuse to acknowledge it too, which is worse.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"SqueakierEel","date":"2016-03-05T17:04:54.493+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey Blaster Joker\nGunna be frank, the system isn't perfect, but it is doing what it can, even if you aren't noticing a difference. From what you've stated I'm going to assume that you got a chat restriction or a ban of some sort and are frustrated about it. Couple things to avoid this.\n\nDon't dodge games, not only does it put you behind in LP but it also gives you a higher chance of being put in low priority que, which is where you don't wanna be.\n\nThis is obvious, but if what you're going to say to a team mate isn't positive, passive or constructive, just mute them and don't talk, in game chat really doesn't add a lot to the game, especially flaming.\n\nKeep reporting those doing wrong, something does happen it just takes time.","replies":[{"poster":"Exarch Leona","date":"2016-07-04T09:45:03.810+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"That moment when you realize reporting does nothing.","replies":[]}]}]}
