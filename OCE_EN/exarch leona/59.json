BUT, compare it to the ACTUAL int feeding coming from the rest. \r\n\r\nMy mate brought up a good point the other day while we were talking about this behaviour. \r\nWhy should we, people genuinely interested in climbing, be punished because people like in the link like to intentionally feed, troll, abuse and ruin the game as a whole?\r\n\r\nAnd as someone pointed out before, I get that trolls be banned from lowering their income but at least then it&#039;ll be easier to play without trolls. Why they support it is beyond me. I have the firm believe that they just encourage it at this point with how frequent it happens and how often they gen punished for it (like, non existent)\r\n\r\nINB4 Forum mod troll Seras rocks up and says it&#039;s okay for them to be doing that.","replies":[{"poster":"Ing√©nue","date":"2017-06-11T10:13:29.763+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"While I wasn't in the game and can't 100% say for sure, I can tell you from an outsider perspective that none of this looks like feeding. \n\nYou were playing **normals** with a team of silvers/bronzes against other silver/bronzes. The enemy team consisted of a fizz/diana and xayah, each are all pretty oppressive snowball champions that people at a bronze/silver and even gold level struggle to play against. Your teamcomp was also lacking in cc (especially when compared to the other team) that would have been needed to shut down these champs. \n\nI can look through your match history (just as I can look through the match history of your allies and opponents in your ranked games) and I can see scores where you are going 0/9. 2/8. 3/7, while the rest of your team is doing comparatively well. Are you trolling in these games?\n**No.** At least I highly hope not. I hope that you are just having a bad game or are up vs an opponent that is better than you (because guess what, that happens. People in ranked are going to be directly matched against someone who is better than them and sometimes they wont perform up to your expectation). \n\nPersonally I like to play normals to learn new champions and practice my off roles (if you look at my match history at the moment it is pretty heckin bad). People like you that make a big deal out of bad games make it hard for people to continue to want to play and experiment. You need to remember that a lot of players (especially when you are playing in bronze and silver) are going to be bad. They arent going to play they way you think they should, but that doesn't necessarily mean they are trolling you. \n\nWe get that it is hard to climb the ranked ladder, but you have to believe that the majority of players are also out to do the same thing. A lot of these players simply aren't good enough to do so yet and instead potate around in silver and bronze while they learn the skills needed.\n\nOf course you are going to encounter true trolls (we all do, every single rank. Even Rioters have trolls in their games). When you find true trolls (not players having a bad game/ being out skilled by opponents) make sure to report them. Every report counts and the trolls will eventually receive punishment.","replies":[{"poster":"Exarch Leona","date":"2017-06-12T05:22:10.186+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"All I got from this is it's okay for other people to ruin the game, but when I'm forced to 1v2 a lane because either the junglers afk or adcs afk, i'm in the wrong.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"LaMaLiCkR","date":"2017-06-24T04:26:13.850+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"you have the most deaths in the game... stop feeding\na kill is not worth it if you die getting it","replies":[]}]}
