A faulty power supply can cause all sorts of weird problems with peripherals and can also make the game freeze (it tends to happen in game because the draw is highest during these times). Do you hear any ticking or any strange sounds from your power supply? And are there any other issues you've been seeing in game?

Any other details you can give?","replies":[]}]}
