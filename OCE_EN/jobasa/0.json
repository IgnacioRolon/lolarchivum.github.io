It seems a little weird as i was disconnected from two games managed to get back and win both. \r\n\r\ni'd just like to say this time that i'm spending waiting here for a game, doesn't make me want to stop leaving games. it just really annoys me to the point where i don't want to play anymore.\r\n\r\nWhat do you guys think about LeaverBuster","replies":[{"poster":"Project Xayah","date":"2015-01-30T11:11:35.543+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"You need to leave a significant amount of games (more than one or two) for more than 5 minutes each time to be hit with leavebuster. Obviously those two were not the only games you left. Also the outcome of the game doesn't matter and it's amazing the amount of people who think it does.","replies":[{"poster":"Chicken4dinner","date":"2015-01-31T09:05:13.674+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I got dc'd from one and was placed in a low priority que, I had not played for 2 months prior","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Ing√©nue","date":"2015-01-30T10:44:50.021+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"It is good because it motivates people to sort out issues that are causing them to leave games, whether it be upgrades in computer and internet, or sorting out negative rage quit behaviour. It also prevents those who have connection issues from joining games and then continuously disconnecting and negatively impacting on the games of their teammates. It has a 5min wait before you get the warning and that is a pretty fair amount of time because if you aren't connected by then, then your team is at a disadvantage.","replies":[]},{"poster":"About 9 Kenyans","date":"2015-01-31T05:35:26.627+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Yeah leavebuster is pretty stupid, ive had the same problem, the first time i disconnected from 2 games in the space of a week due to leauges firewall issue, the second after 1 game from league crashing and I rejoined and won still, and the third after leaving no games and not afking at any point giving me a 30 minute wait time, I feel your pain, I have even sent a ticket over it and the response was in simpler words \"too bad\". If the actual mechanics behind it were to do with afking or leaving and not reconnecting it would be a great idea but alas, this is league of legends, you cant expect much.","replies":[]}]}
