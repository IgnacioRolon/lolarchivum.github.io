[What do you think?]","subforum":"Gameplay & Strategy","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Many people comment on the strength of Riven as a champion often exclaiming she is over powered (OP) or very strong.While Riven is annoying to verse due to her low cooldown and resourceless abilities it is still possible to win.Her kit works well for her to jump in and deal high amounts of damage against a group or single.I am writing this because my friend mentioned her shield scales with her primary stat which is attack damage (AD).If you compare this to other AD champions or Bruisers you will find that none of them have their shields scale with AD.\r\n-{{champion:59}} Jarvan and {{champion:157}} Yasuo both have a set shield amount that does not scale with any stat.\r\n-{{champion:98}} Shen,{{champion:64}} Lee-Sin and {{champion:72}} Skarner all scale with ability power (AP).\r\n-{{champion:14}} Sion with AP and maximum health.\r\n-{{champion:6}} Urgot scales with AP and maximum mana\r\nAD champions are very strong as they do not have to rely on their abilities to deal damage,however their abilities can add significant damage or utility to them.The examples mentioned above while not having the highest AD damage in the game are all designed so that they have counter play in terms of lower damage reduction through shields.Riven is lacking this as her shield scales with AD,in addition to this it has no resource to use it other than a short cooldown.I think that Riven has a decent advantage due to this type of scaling,the only thing I am wondering is why she was given this scaling.If there is someone who knows the reasoning behind why this is a good idea can they please mention it below or,do you think this is a very strange scaling as well?.\r\n\r\n*When the term shield is mentioned it is referring to a form of protection that can be broken which absorb damage before damaging health.It does not include damage reductions such as {{champion:11}} Master Yi&#039;s Meditate and {{champion:12}} Alistair&#039;s Ultimate or through giving resistances such as {{champion:86}} Garen&#039;s courage or {{champion:3}} Galio&#039;s  bulwark.It also does not include forms of healing or giving health such as {{champion:117}} Lulu&#039;s wild growth\r\n\r\n*Ability power (AP) champions were omitted from these comparison as ability power champions do not have constant damage as they need their cooldowns to reset.Attack damage champions do not have cooldown periods when their damage output is as significantly reduced.AD champions are also able to be compared more easily with Riven as they have similar characteristics.*","replies":[{"poster":"BladeSensual","date":"2015-03-28T10:20:22.633+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"lol her shield got nerfed heaps. got nerfed by a 1 second duration. if u cant deal with her then learn. interrupt her 3rd q. sidestep ultimate. her e is nowhere near as powerful as it was b4 when she had permashield. she is an exception. she has one of the lowest base hp regen in the game. if you think that her shield is bad, wat about permaheal raka or tryn q that scales with his fury and gives u hp, not a shield. she is balanced. the only reason she is trong is ebcause she is in the meta. the meta is changing to tanks and she wont b played as much.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Holland","date":"2015-03-28T03:52:52.935+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Riven's shield is a bit too strong they need to make the scaling even lower.
