I was having second thoughts..  \r\n\r\nTuenak comforted me _&#039;its okay my friend, Were going to meet deity who will change our lives forever&#039; he said with a smile  &#039;Sister Elise will guide us to the path we have nothing to worry about&#039; \r\n_\r\nThe boat had taken as it Disappeared into the mist, we set off into the forest, I had heard that the Shadow Isles were once a mighty kingdom, far more advanced than Piltover and had the defense of the mighty kingdom of Demacia. I only thought the stories were just.. well stories, Walking for hours with the brothers of the faith as our protectors and sister Elise was at-least comforting, i still didn&#039;t buy this &quot;cult&quot; behavior, but we had nothing else in Bilgewater, What she offered was too good to be true but Tuenak was too invested in Eternal Life, Thinking about it convinced me more and more that we will be fine. \r\n\r\nWalking deeper into the Forests, We could see ruins of large, stone structures. always hearing twigs snapping or noises that i had never heard of. This made all of us on the Pilgrimage more and more concerned. We had feelings that we were being watched constantly, many of us saw things move, alas Elise was reassuring us that we were not too far, she mentioned she walked the path for decades and it was completely safe. \r\n\r\nTuenak and i had carried blades, even though carrying weapons were contraband, It would Insult the mighty Vilemaw, We were expert swordsman, we were not unfamiliar to violence and death, We could handle ourselves.. but there was something about this place which made us feel uncomfortable and weak. Was it the sounds? the Mist? I had a feeling we were being lead to a trap. \r\n\r\nAfter two straight hours of traveling through death filled valleys and forests, we came across a pit of Bones. We stopped. Sister Elise took off her hood and began to chant, We all stared at her, We must be close. She stopped chanting and spoke to us, \r\n\r\n_&#039;Brethren we are close to our saviour&#039;,_ she paused and pointed toward the direction we were walking towards, _&#039;The Temple is close by , We must past the battlefield the Institute of War constructed, Stick close to me&#039; _\r\n\r\nWe Started walking around the pit and we followed like sheep, one of the pilgrims stopped and observed the pit, he was  curious staring at one of the skulls, he bent over and decided to pick it up staring at it and analyzing the skull, Tuenak went up to him, \r\n\r\n_&#039;Brother Leave the skull, Let us advance with Sister Elise&#039; _he said with a smile, \r\n\r\nThe Pilgrim replied, _&#039;sorry my brother, I was captivated by the skull_&#039; he paused  _&#039;What foul creatures lurk here to cause this?&#039;_\r\n\r\nHe dropped the skull back into the pit, as he turned around to walk back us an arm reached out and grabbed his ankle, He yelled for help, Sister Elise stopped and ran back for the Pilgrim, his abdomen was half in the pit with his hands clinging onto Tuenak, Sister Elise commanded Tuenak to let go, \r\n\r\n_&#039;Im not leaving our brother for the evils of this place&#039;_ he yelled, _&#039;Help me by the gods!&#039;_\r\n\r\nSister Elise slowly approached Tuenak, and pulled out a dagger from her Veil, she stared at Tuenak, \r\n\r\n_&#039;Step aside fool&#039;_ she hissed, Tuenak let go of the brother, as Elise crouched whilst the pilgrim clung on to the dirt. Sister Elise took the blade and swung at his hands.\r\n\r\n_&#039;Please noo, Help me dammit&#039;_ Yelled the Pilgrim, She cut of his hands, The group were shocked too see her do this to one of our Brothers. he was immediately swept under the pit, nothing but silence came after that.\r\n\r\nWe never said anything we looked at each other. In our minds we were questioning_ &#039;what is she doing?&#039;,  &#039;why did she do it?&#039;_\r\n\r\nTuenak reacted in fury, _&#039;Why did you do that! Why didn&#039;t you save him?&#039; \r\n_\r\nSister Elise smiled and replied _&#039;he was already doomed&#039;_ as she licked the blade with the blood of her brother _&#039;i told you to stick close to me, he was a fool for not listening.. he wont be receiving eternal life with us no longer&#039; _\r\n\r\nTuenak didn&#039;t respond, we all stayed quite and continued our Journey forward. \r\n\r\nWe made it to the battlefield which Sister Elise described as an _&#039;Abomination&#039;_ . It was amazing, i had heard of stories of fields of Justice where the mighty from all of Runeterra come to fight. In the distance a bright purple light was shining in an object which appeared to look like a crystal of sorts, we could hear a loud humming noise. \r\n\r\nSister Elise called it a Nexus. she never told us what this Nexus does or its purpose. she warned us not venture near  it as it attracts spirits such as the one in the pit. we kept our distance and crossed a valley filled with shrubs. here we saw dried up corpses, helmets, swords. a large battle was taken place here. The dried corpses looked unusual but we didn&#039;t question our main focus was to meet Lord Vilemaw. \r\n\r\nAfter hours of endless walking and dramatic events we came across a cave. Elise smiled with glee,\r\n\r\n_&#039;We have arrived&#039;_ she said as she turned towards the group. \r\n\r\nThe group ignored her and they were captivated by the entrance ceiling of the cave, It was humongous!, However the group and i were more observant of the spider webs that were as large as the ship we boarded. I was not as keen as most of the brothers and sisters were to enter, I didn&#039;t like what was happening.\r\n\r\n_&#039;There&#039;s nothing to fear.&#039;_ she smiled _&#039;we will press on&#039; _\r\n\r\n_______________________________________________________________________________________________________________\r\n\r\nTo be Continued.... {{champion:60}}","replies":[]}
