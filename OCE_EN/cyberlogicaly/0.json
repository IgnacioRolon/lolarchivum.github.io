And then whenever someone or a close friend wants to gift you a skin they can see which 3 skins you always wanted. This would be simple to create i assume with all the skilled programmer&#039;s working at riot and would avoid a situation where you get a skin for a champ you do not play.\r\nThis happened to me many times as my friends always just looked at a champ i was playing at the time and then for my birthday gifted me a skin for that champ. I hope my idea is clear and please up vote. Thanks guys now go and climb that ladder and go elo hunting in ranked. gg","replies":[{"poster":"Star","date":"2016-08-17T05:13:11.507+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Could be a good idea, but Riot are so busy at the moment. \n\nWorlds, ultimate skin, and a new champion all before the end of the year.

Maybe it will be for one of the assassins getting updated? I know I would definitely invest in it if it was for Talon.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Bambooze","date":"2016-08-17T07:53:31.992+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Another ultimate?

I hadn't thought about the gifting possibilities that it opens up so it's great you mentioned it. Also, my line of thought was that a wishlist is good for people who know what they want, don't have the rp at the time and need any easy way to remind themselves when they do. It could also give a notification when them item goes on sale too.","replies":[]}]}
