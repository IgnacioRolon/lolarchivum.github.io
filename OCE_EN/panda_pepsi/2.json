I first made it to be Annie&#039;s twin sister called Freya that used water instead of fire and created a water elemental like tibbers but it basically was Annie but with slightly different abilities. Then I made it into Tirranna who was a good idea but boring kit so I changed the kit into a more exciting one and all of the abilities worked except the ult. I have no idea how high I was when I made it but I was off my nuts bro. I kept some of her key concepts that make her a unique champion although for these abilities I made minor buffs and nerfs to the damage, cooldown, etc. I also changed her lore a bit.\nYou may now read my 3rd version of Tirranna (it&#039;s just like Ryze hey).\n\n_**Tirranna, the Ocean&#039;s Might**_\nTirranna is a mage with long cooldowns but strong abilities. She does great in team fights but has little chance on her own. She couldn&#039;t really do much after she used her abilities so I made her w a short cooldown offensive ability so that she can be a little more useful than just chuck out everything and run while you wait for cooldowns. Tirranna excels in supporting with her unique cc and healing.\n\n_**Lore:** _\nTirranna lived in Bilgewater in a lonely house by herself. She is often seen walking the streets of Bilgewater just by the sea, staring out upon the vast Guardian&#039;s Sea. Tirranna lived a normal life, working as a maid in the local tavern. No one knew of her hidden skill in water magic. During the days when it rained she would go outside where none could see her and she would practice her skills. Eventually, Tirranna got so skilled that she could multiply a small amount of water to make a greater amount. She bought an empty potion bottle and filled it with water. She now only needs that small amount of water to create any form of water she chooses. She never goes anywhere without her bottle.\n\n_**Appearance: **_\nhttps://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/328217131412094976/329142165236088833/Tirranna.jpg\n\n_**Stats:**_\n468 Health (+60 per level)\n396 Mana (+45 per level)\n52 AD (+3.2 per level)\n0 AP (as usual)\n22 Armor (+4 per level)\n30 Magic Resist (+ 1 per level)\n335 Movement Speed\n0.625 Attack Speed (+1.7% per level)\n\n_**Abilities: **_\n_**Passive - Waters Harmony:**_ \nWhenever Tirranna is in water **(River/Downpour/Whirlpool)** she gains **20** movement speed (stacks) and a shield that builds up to **30/40/50/60/70/80 (+40% AP)** lasting 4 seconds after she exits the water.\n\n_**Q - Downpour:**_ \nTirranna makes the area rain for **3/3.5/4/4.5/5** seconds. While Tirranna and all allied champions are in the downpour, they are healed for **20/30/40/50/60 (+15% AP)** health per second. While enemies are in the rain they take **20/30/40/50/60 (+15% AP)** damage per second.\n**Mana: 60/70/80/90/100\nCooldown: 15/14/13/12/11**\n\n_**W - Water Whip:**_ \nTirranna whips in a straight line with water, dealing **50/70/90/110/130 (+75% AP)**.  If Tirranna hits an enemy champion, the cooldown is reduced by **3** seconds.\n**Mana: 40/45/50/55/60\nCooldown: 10/9/8/7/6**\n\n_**E - Whirlpool:**_ \nTirranna channels for 1.5 seconds and makes a small whirlpool for **3/3.5/4/4.5/5** seconds drawing enemies into the middle. If an enemy is moving away from the center of the whirlpool, they are slowed by **10%/15%/20%/25%/30%**. If the enemy is moving towards the center of the whirlpool it increases their movement speed by **10%/15%/20%/25%/30%**. Upgrading the ability increases the size (same size difference as Anivia&#039;s ult when she just puts it down to when it scales to full size) and also the speed that it draws them in. \n**Mana:  80/85/90/95/100\nCooldown: 18/17/16/15/14**\n\n_**R - Strengthening Waters:** _\nTirranna creates a sphere of water on an allied champion for **3/4/5** seconds, granting **50/60/70** bonus armor and magic resist over the duration. When the shield expires, the target is healed for **100/125/150 (+40% AP)** and an additional **40%/50%/60%** of damage taken over the duration.\n**Mana: 100/110/120\nCooldown: 90/80/70**\n\nHere&#039;s the original if you can be bothered reading that retarded trash.
