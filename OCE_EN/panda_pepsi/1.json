When I made him he was sooo broken (AD scaled up to more than 500 at level 18, he had really high attack speed and high scaling on his abilities). I didn&#039;t make a lore on the original version and idk why lel. Making the lore takes time and effort cause you gotta look up stuff about league but that&#039;s where half the fun is so idk what I was doing. Anyway here it is, Nikzo 2.0 or whatever you wanna call it. xd\n\n_**Nikzo, the Dusk Assassin**_\nNikzo is an assassin that uses either his daggers or his rifle. While Nikzo is using his daggers, he can jump in with his shadow dash, deal damage and quickly jump out. While he is using his rifle, Nikzo can kite with his slow and if in a choke point, can deal high damage with his bouncing bullet.\n\n_**Lore:**_\nNikzo is arguably the best assassin in all of Valoran, he has unmatched speed and impeccable accuracy. He hates being sloppy and he executes his jobs in the cleanest way possible. Quick, no witnesses, no evidence. Nikzo used to work for only himself, finding jobs and bounties all throughout Runterra, though he found all the travelling boring so he decided to stick to one place. He didn&#039;t care which side he was on as long as their was money to be made and since he liked to live the clean life, he decided to stay in Demacia and join their cause so he could get some action. Most people asked, &quot;Why not join Noxus and kill for fun?&quot; and Nikzo replied with the same answer every time. &quot;Because Noxus smells bad and I like Demacia&#039;s colors.&quot; Nikzo now takes out Noxian targets, whether they are a citizens or highly trained warriors, Nikzo kills them with ease. \n\n_**Appearance**_\nhttps://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/328217131412094976/328217212424945664/Nikzo.jpg\nI made this from a thing called Hero Machine 3. It&#039;s not exactly what I envisioned but it&#039;s about what he should look like.\n\n_**Stats:**_\n583 Health (+90 per level)\n200 Energy\n60 AD (+3.5 per level)\n0 AP (as usual)\n26.88 Armor (+3.5 per level)\n32 Magic Resist (+1.25 per level)\n360 Movement Speed\n0.625 Attack Speed (+2.9% per level)\n\n_**Abilities:**\n**Passive - Assassins Speed:**_\nNikzo hones his speed to gain **1%/3%/6%/9%/12%/15%** attack speed and movement speed (scales every 3 levels).\n\n_**Q - Shadow Dash/Crippling Shot:**_\n**Daggers:** Nikzo dashes through the shadows, blinking to a target dealing **70/85/100/115/130 (+50% AD)** physical damage. Shadow dash has 2 charges. (Can be cast on allies)\n**Rifle:** Nikzo aims for 0.5 seconds and shoots the targets leg slowing them by **20%/25%/30%/35%/40%** for 2 seconds and dealing **60/75/90/105/120 (+40% AD)** physical damage.\n**Cooldown - Daggers: 2 seconds. 10/9/8/7/6 second recharge.\nCooldown - Rifle: 12/11/10/9/8 seconds.\nEnergy - Daggers: 50 at all ranks.\nEnergy - Rifle: 80/75/70/65/60**\n\n_**W - Poisoned Daggers/Flaming Rifle:**_ **PASSIVE EFFECT.**\n**Daggers:** Poisoned daggers allows Nikzo to do poison damage every 4th hit for **40/45/50/55/60 (+70% AP)** magic damage per second for 3 seconds.\n**Rifle:** Flaming rifle allows Nikzo to do burn damage every 4th hit for **40/45/50/55/60 (+70% AP)** magic damage per second for 3 seconds. \n**Does not stack.**\n\n_**E - Curved Slice/Bouncing Bullet:**_\n**Daggers:** Nikzo sweeps his daggers from the sides into the middle (this animation should take about 0.5 seconds) dealing **60/80/100/120/140 (+40% AD)** physical damage, enemies in the center are hit by both daggers, doubling the damage.\n**Rifle:** Nikzo shoots a bullet that bounces off the first 2 objects hit (wall, turret, etc). Each time an enemies is hit by the bullet, they take **70/80/90/100/110 (+65% AD)** physical damage. (The way this is used is really hard to explain but like if you shoot straight at a wall it will come back to you. If you shoot it at like a 45 degree angle then it will leave at a 45 degree angle.)\n**Cooldown - Daggers: 14/13/12/11/10 seconds.\nCooldown - Rifle: 12/11/10/9/8 seconds.\nEnergy: 90/85/80/75/70 for both.**\n\n_**R - Switch:**_\nNikzo switches between his daggers and his rifle. When Nikzo switches to his daggers he increases his attack speed by **10%/20%/30%** for **2/3/4** seconds. When he switches to his sniper rifle he increases his range and ignores **5%/10%/15%** armor for the first 3 shots. (Nikzo starts with his ult just like Jayce and Elise)\n**Cooldown: 10/9/8 seconds.\nEnergy: 60 at all ranks.**\n\nHere&#039;s the original if you can be bothered reading the broken trash that I made 2 years ago.\nhttps://boards.oce.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/player-creations/tWs2Hw4P-nikzo-the-silent-assassin","replies":[{"poster":"Talon12","date":"2017-06-25T03:36:07.602+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":">Daggers: Nikzo shadow dashes (like goes into a dark cloud thing and quickly teleports to them leaving the trail of dark stuffs) to a target dealing 70/85/100/115/130 (+50% AD) physical damage.
