This screenshot is showing the bans of the game, but there is something special about these bans. They are recurring throughout every damn game. THESE SAME BANS. Now flashback to 6.2 and what do we have here??? &quot;Juggernaut changes&quot; because lets make our tanks now deal tonnes of damage!!! Changes and balance changes are all welcomes but when you make changes to specific tanks for no reason other than the devs want to see more people play them because they want to make skins or something along those lines (I don&#039;t exactly know the motives behind such ridiculously game breaking changes) is honestly immoral. WHY change them. WHY break the game. You say you don&#039;t want to &#039;force the meta&#039; but that is LITERALLY EXACTLY WHAT YOU ARE DOING. So at least when you talk in a video or release a statement, don&#039;t LIE and say &quot;oh yeah we don&#039;t want to force the meta and we aren&#039;t forcing the meta&quot;, just tell the fucking truth. You are forcing the meta and breaking it. These champions are literally getting banned every game for a reason. \r\n\r\nOpen discussion\r\n\r\nTLDR juggernauts are BROKEN meta forced, riot are imbeciles.","replies":[{"poster":"Serkumanl","date":"2015-09-17T13:23:00.205+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Lets take  3 balanced champions and give them a heap of free stats.

(Mobility from assassins or range from mages)\n\nSkarner, I'm not sure. I just like the free 10 gold I get from his pillars. Better than Trundle.\n\nI'm not even going to touch Mordekaiser (even with a 10 ft pole), let's just leave him in the pit we left Riven in and deal with it later.\n\nFiora is better in bot lane, IMO!
