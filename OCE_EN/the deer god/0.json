But, after a while of playing with it, i got the feeling that it was really well made, and had a lot of user friendly features. It was very very good.\r\n\r\nThis new Hud however, is a little off. Not because im used to the old one, but because of a few things that have really messed me up.\r\nFor starters, the balance of the UI is off. Everything is lumped onto the right, this might not seem like a big deal, but it throws a wrench into a lot of play, making it harder to see things on the right, and bringing a huge eye to the left. This will have a very small advantage to people playing on the right side of the map, but also makes focus on the left side harder to maintain over large periods of time.\r\n\r\nSecond, the champion stats and item lists are too small. This may just be a personal preference, but i always had my old Hud as small as it could get, but with that it didn&#039;t interfere with the items or stats. They were always there, and easy to read. It feels very out of place to have my items so small, and to the right. Plus the fact that the enemy items just seem far too small. Also its not overly clear what the stats are, the images don&#039;t seem to fit, or are too small to see properly.\r\n\r\nThe design is very nice, it looks very good, and i appreciate the work you&#039;ve put into it, but the fact that you&#039;ve jumbled it all up makes it feel less straight forward. Theres less flow to it, its too boxed in and in odd places. Everything just seems like its out of place, thematically its off too, it&#039;d fit a scifi game well, but not a fantasy game like league.\r\n\r\nThere are things you could do that would make it very wonderful.\r\nLike the ability to place where you want your items, and how much information is displayed. I really liked having my score displayed on the top right, and i liked having my personal stats on the bottom left. Also, why the heck can&#039;t i see my ping and frames like usual? having these open to view helped a tonne on my low end Laptop.\r\n\r\nTL;DR: This new Hud looks amazing, and is a nice change, but the flow and focus of it is very off and not balanced quite well. Plus certain things are too small, and not enough info displayed. Bring back Heart of Gold.","replies":[{"poster":"Bookbash","date":"2015-07-23T13:30:59.978+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Fair comment. I would like Riot to make it so that when you press TAB its a BIG screen of information, not a small one to fidget around with checking stats. You want to be quickly checking things in game, not reading for ever. Also I think that having a big clump of stuff in the centre of the screen actually wastes space, because the centre is where the action is. I also like personal stuff in the bottom left corner as previously, but they could keep the 4 other teammates cluster on top of the mini map. That would be the only change I would say is ok. Giant bars for updating your skills are just a waste of space. Make them small and simple.\n\n A customisable HUD would solve all problems for all users.","replies":[]}]}
