They are toxic, unteachable, unreasonable. But besides, report them for inting has nothing changes, some players' behavior is even worse than new players'. And the whole rank system just unpleasant, once you started your losing streak, you can not go back as fast as you lost, even it's not your fault, the punishing system just so strong that some of us stuck at some point where bad players will come and ruin your game. Please do something for these players. Or just simply change up the mechanic a little for rank points. Thank you Riot. I truly love this game but such a community just made me feel sick.","replies":[{"poster":"Exarch Leona","date":"2019-06-24T02:50:29.563+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Can confirm this, 2 games in and ive had 7 inters and an afk. \nI wish I was screwing with, but im not. \n\nEven worse, despite being brought up constantly, riot ignore it because and I quote from the ticket submitted \"there is nothing wrong with that kind of behavior\".\n\nJust wait my dude, riot will get woke and just go broke, and we will never have to deal with the bs again &lt;3","replies":[]},{"poster":"Talk about life","date":"2019-06-22T13:33:23.843+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"What I am saying is that I met with those bad behavior players CONSISTENTLY, Lost the game even it wasn't my fault but the rewards weren't that grateful.
