It&#039;s pre-season and we&#039;re getting placements out of nowhere, what do this placements mean anyway, I found it super confusing Riot isn&#039;t explaining all of this, will this placements affect us?\n\n Because if they do it&#039;s unfair because it&#039;s so rigged high plats like me and diamonds keep getting placed in silver matches, and after I played like 4 matches mostly all plats and diamonds I get in a low gold / silver match up, so I feel if this will count for anything it will ruin the entire game this isn&#039;t fair match up, this isn&#039;t fair qualification.\n\n I won a easy game my team was all diamonds and the other team mostly low gold players and silvers, and then I get a match up where my entire team is silver 3-5 and I&#039;m facing an entire plat team, result = loss.\nI don&#039;t mind loosing but this match ups aren&#039;t being controlled at all, at least it doesn&#039;t seem to be.\n\nThey don't say why this flex queue is counting in 5v5 rankeds even though I'm playing solo, and what will it count for anything in the game?","replies":[{"poster":"Dry Ice King","date":"2016-11-09T13:28:39.120+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"I got matched with Platinium's and I'm silver, I thought they where boosted but then no we got completely destroyed and for more fun 2nd game again against Platinium's, is this game going insane?

IDK why they dont just turn it off to fix it. Im getting matches within 2 mins usually, a crazy mix of plat to bronze. Its so fun playing against a plat adc when you are divisions below them, so much fun.","replies":[]},{"poster":"DawgnTheBoys","date":"2016-11-11T02:27:40.947+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yeah I'm low gold and get paired with plats a little and get bronze on my team, but they have been terrible and we win anyways lol, I thought they were just boosted or something, every game has been strange that's for sure","replies":[]},{"poster":"The Wanak King","date":"2016-11-09T22:32:31.298+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"My ADC last game was so bad Gold V 0 LP, Clearly boosted xD","replies":[]}]}
