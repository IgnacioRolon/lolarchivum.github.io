I assume this refers to the gold border and the skins is that a gold player receives?  I don&#039;t really care about the skin but the border is something that&#039;s actually there every game....\n\nI haven&#039;t ever received a penalty or anything of the sort, I main support only and am constantly receiving usually multiple honours per game and it says i&#039;ve reached the last checkpoint before honour 2....  Well, look at the amount of games i&#039;ve played and please explain to me why I&#039;m not already level 2 and how much longer I have to spend playing to receive the rewards for quite a bit of playing already.  Frankly I don&#039;t see it actually being possible.\n\nThis is ridiculous, I came here to LoL from World of Warcraft where I played Arena at 2K+ because I was under the impression that grinding mindlessly for no real reason aside &quot;you have to grind&quot; was not something this game was known for....   O.k, I didn&#039;t notice the fine print it seems but the fine print makes no mention that after receiving constant and numerous honours from team mates in  please look how many games I&#039;ve played getting to where I am I will &quot;still be arbitrarily close to honour level 2, but by doing the math that means you&#039;re still going to be quite possibly hundreds of games away from receiving rewards for the almost 800 games you&#039;ve already played and finished in Gold.&quot;\n\n800 games is a lot of games, I will not be taking part in the game further if this is the ridiculous result of what is a ridiculous amount of time I've already played the game for in the first place.  I have spent a lot of time playing League of Legends now in my first season and there is no way this can be right, is there some error in the system or am I misunderstanding something?   800 games, and that is not including the time i spent leveling up to 30 in the first place.  I have no choice but to leave if this is the case.  I don&#039;t want to, I like game but this is worse than anything from WoW and frankly I am scratching my head.","replies":[{"poster":"LAKIGR","date":"2018-10-15T09:25:19.113+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"Your contradicting your self here you say you have never “ever received a penalty or anything of the sort” yet you start at honor 2 so u should not have to get your honor up unless you have been reported and received a penalty","replies":[{"poster":"waffen","date":"2018-10-16T03:17:00.791+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"No, I've never received a penalty.  I don't know anything about starting at level 2 or not and I have started playing this season if that has anything to do with it...  If everyone does start at level two then there has been a fault in the system.  \n\nAfter playing one game last night and receiving honour I logged out and logged back in and I get level 2 honour, so thankyou very much the odd co-incidence gods.","replies":[{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2018-10-16T06:47:22.233+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"If you've never received a penalty you should never have been below honour level 2.
