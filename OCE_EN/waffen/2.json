Not surprisingly it in no way combats the existence of the toxicity.  True.\n\n The speaker cannot come up with a single intelligent reason for ranked not to have this feature implemented.  Why is full communication's for the entire 5-man team not the way solo/duo is played? \n\nA:  In a nutshell, ranked becomes toxic primarily because people spend time wasting other peoples time. As a secondary, this is in large part because there currently exists no effective communication tool to facilitate the entire team experiencing/learning/teaching in real time together.\n\nB:  Forget directly attempting to manipulate the primary variable as it is a qualitative,  manipulate the secondary.  This is logical. \n\n  \ni) Effective communication reduces conflict exponentially, and vice versa.  This is true.\n\nii) Effective communication enables far more complexity in execution of game play.  This is true.\n\niii) Effective communication enables immediate learning, otherwise known as intelligent action.  This is true. \n\niv) Balancing would certainly become **easier** if all ranked play was with full team comm's.  This is true.\n\nv)  League of Legends ranked solo/duo can be so less than neighbourly that what was an enjoyable and engaging game very quickly becomes much less so  due to a seedy underbelly of social &amp; personal unpleasantries.  This is true.  \n\nvi)  Sometimes this underbelly is nothing more than team members simply doing silly things and costing everyone time only because they don't know any better.  This is true.\n\nvii)  Human Beings are both incredibly intelligent &amp; social creatures.  This is true.  \n\nviii)  In order to solve (v) &amp; (vi), refer to (i), (ii), and (iii).  This is true.\n\nix)  Refuse to accept the numbers because it's all so simple it can't possible be true... \n\n","replies":[{"poster":"Exarch Leona","date":"2019-08-13T09:06:31.634+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Assuming this ISN'T bait, i'll break things down realistically for you since it's clear you are intentionally trying to start a fight. \n\n\"i) Effective communication reduces conflict exponentially, and vice versa.\"\nThis is both true and false. You still come across people more interested in flaming than not. That's the way league is. I'll leave you to be in denial for that. \n\n\"ii) Effective communication enables far more complexity in execution of game play.\"\nFalse, this just makes communicating that you're about to do something easier, this does not change people following up or not. \nYou could scream till your blue in the face but more often than not, people won't follow up. \n\n\"iii) Effective communication enables immediate learning, otherwise known as intelligent action.\"\nIn otherwords \"communicate and be insta pro tier\".\nNo, learning doesn't work like that.

HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA theres no way you're serious about that. \n\nI'm not sorry that I had to be realistic, but someone had to be in case you weren't trolling. \nWatch though as you get white knighted though, because they're in as much denial as you.","replies":[]}]}
