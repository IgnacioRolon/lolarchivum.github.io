It appears to me that riot could not stop all these trolls and inters in ranked although it&rsquo;s pre-season. If you are not able to punish these trolls and inters in ranked. It will literally ruins the experiences of not just me but others who&rsquo;ve decided to rank and if you dont fix these issues and implement changes &amp; punishment; a lot of people including myself will uninstall like many others had and will\n\nYou should may as well fix the ranking lp gaining and losing, gaining less than you lose is really tilting and time consuming. If you make a staple and consistent lp gain and lose like 20 lp gain and loss, this will ensure that  if you will recover the lp from the loss even from trolls and inters as mentioned in my previous point. There is no point of ranking when you are required to win 2 games in the row to recover from the loss from 1 game. I strongly recommend this issues with losing due to unnecessary reasons such as trolls and inters to be fix immediately to ensure a balance and fair leaguing experiences for players.","replies":[{"poster":"7S Stylish ","date":"2017-11-22T11:56:36.809+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Dont even swear at them, but riot just cant punish them","replies":[]},{"poster":"Essembie","date":"2017-11-21T20:38:52.750+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Just don't swear at a troll because you'll get an instant 14 day ban while they get off scott free.","replies":[]},{"poster":"QAPLA","date":"2017-11-21T19:52:33.634+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I wouldn't know, I only ARAM.\n\nSorry if I misjudged.","replies":[]},{"poster":"QAPLA","date":"2017-11-20T19:51:51.270+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Bronze issues?\n\nI doubt you'll find much of that behaviour above scrub level.","replies":[{"poster":"7S Stylish ","date":"2017-11-21T06:14:03.862+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Just because it is not bronze, doesnâ€™t necessarily means that there are less trolls and inters; its just that bronze have more.","replies":[]},{"poster":"7S Stylish ","date":"2017-11-20T21:05:20.351+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Im in platium","replies":[]},{"poster":"JasonWazza","date":"2017-11-20T21:05:57.673+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Just going to point out he is plat.","replies":[]}]}]}
