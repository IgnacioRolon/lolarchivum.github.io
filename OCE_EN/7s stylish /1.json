Don't give me those bs about mmr blah blah blah, doesn't explain why i'm getting match with plats players into a full diamond team?????\r\n\r\nAdditionally, these plats are the most insecure and annoying piece of human being to ever play this game. Xerath taking all my farms cos i had to afk for 2 mins, \"this is my xerath, idc if i lose\". Aatrox decided to afk farm after we pinged him back before he gets caught in which he did . This was the free-est game. So tell me, how are these players still able to play or even be in a diamond game ??????????????????????????????","replies":[{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2019-05-12T10:11:47.030+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The MMR difference between P2 and D4 is not large. Even rank wise it's only a single div separation.\n\nThe MMR difference between P2s with 60% win-rates (still climbing) and D4s with sub 50% win-rates (plateaued or dropping) is basically nil.\n\nVisible rank *isn't everything*. There is a reason you are being matched with and against these players.","replies":[{"poster":"uNhoLeee","date":"2019-05-12T12:41:52.283+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"no its a huge difference, at that elo the curve is much greater than something like gold4 to silver 2. p1 promos to diamond is a huge hurdle few players overcome. infact, took me 7 tries last season. \n\nOce server has a lack of players and matchmaking suffers. The algorithms are too lenient at the moment across all regions as well.","replies":[{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2019-05-12T13:13:51.470+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Not if you take the lower MMR range of D4 and the upper MMR range of P2, that's the whole point. \n\nP2 with a 60%WR? They're going to be in Diamond before long. 47/48%? They're pretty much sitting there. Not to mention the *D3* with a 61% on the plat team. Look at their KDs too. The extremes of WRs on the enemy team have only played a few games so the stat means basically nothing.\n\nYes, the population is an issue in quiet times in higher elos, but there is nothing unusual or abnormal about the matchmaking in this game. On my second account I'm playing with and vsing Plats despite the account being *Silver 1*, because it's a smurf and the system knows roughly what rank you should be well before your visible rank catches up.\n\nThe usual skill difference between D4 and D3 is equal if not greater than for P2-D4, but that always gets ignored in posts like these.","replies":[]}]}]}]}
