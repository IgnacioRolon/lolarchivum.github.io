They typically just take the concept and work it from there. If a skin concept or art piece is frequently mentioned on the forums, it will eventually be implemented. The latest example of this is Pool Party Zac, whose idea was created on [deviantart ](http://www.deviantart.com/art/League-of-Legends-Pool-Party-Zac-488819619) 8 months ago.\n\nSo yeh, they do, but there is a lot of crap they have to filter through though...","replies":[]},{"poster":"Yasei Doubutsu","date":"2015-06-12T19:41:37.457+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yes, Veigar is actually made and voiced by a summoner.\nSomething similar for Voli, and skins like Party fiddle sticks.\n\nMedieval twitch was also made by 2 summoners.","replies":[{"poster":"Ediwir","date":"2015-06-13T05:05:17.245+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Miss Fortune also was a user suggestion if i remember correctly.
