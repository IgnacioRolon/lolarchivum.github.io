That's all it takes.\n\n> An appeal, so that if it wasn't your fault and you did everything possible to rejoin the game, you can appeal the banishment to low priority and get back into the action.\n\nYou can do this already, you know. Just jump on the support section of the website (link at the top of the page) and send in a ticket describing your situation. You're never guaranteed to get \"off the hook\" though, so don't be disappointed if they tell you \"tough sh!t, deal with it\".","replies":[]},{"poster":"KGB Elemental","date":"2015-12-14T20:29:57.258+0000","up_votes":0,"down_votes":0,"body":"I would like to appeal my low priority ban.
