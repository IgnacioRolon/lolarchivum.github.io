I have an issue with my account where the settings change every time I restart the client. How? Let me show you an example:\nBefore I close the client, the config file shows this:\n\nWindowMode=2  (borderless mode)\n\nand my input.ini file shows this:\n\nevtRadialEmoteInstantOpen=[t] (means press t to open emote window)\nevtPushToTalk=[t] (means press t to enable mic and talk)\n\nNow look what happens when I close my client, and re-login to my account\n\nconfig file now shows this:\n\nWindowMode=1 (window mode)\n\nand now my input.ini file shows this:\n\nevtRadialEmoteInstantOpen= (means unassigned)\nevtPushToTalk= (means unassigned)\n\nthe settings just change as soon as I login to my account. This is driving me crazy because every time I login to my account I have to re adjust the settings.\n\nHere are the things that I have tried so far:\n&quot;Initiate full repair&quot;\nre-installing the game\nand a bunch of random things that never worked out\n\nPlease help me with this issue because it has been happening to me for a few months.","replies":[{"poster":"QAPLA","date":"2018-11-18T21:51:46.688+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"So you assign the same key (t) to more than one function and then wonder why the client rejects it?\nAs for window mode, idk.\n\nMost games don't like you assigning the same key to multiple functions, most won't even let you try.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2018-11-18T05:43:09.675+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I would recommend submitting a ticket to player support: https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/requests/new\n\nThey are likely more able to help you than anyone on boards.","replies":[]}]}
