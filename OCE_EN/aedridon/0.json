My friend has about the same wins. He started playing league later than me but he jumped into ranked and now he&#039;s gold IV.  So that got me wondering if I should try ranked. \r\n\r\nHow I visualise ranked:\r\n1. Serious form of normals\r\n2. More trolls and ragers and toxic players\r\n3. If you make a mistake there&#039;s gonna be that one player who starts raging. They&#039;ll call you noob and go play bots etc \r\n\r\nTHEN, I watched bronze moments on Machinimarealm and I don&#039;t know if ranked is more overrated than I thought. On one hand, I&#039;m wondering if I play ranked I&#039;ll breeze through it. On the other hand, I&#039;m thinking I&#039;m a really bad player and if I try ranked I&#039;m gonna lose every placement match (is that the term? I&#039;m also not familiar with the system). \r\n\r\nAnyone who has experience playing ranked please tell me what&#039;s it really like","replies":[{"poster":"RÄ±n","date":"2015-05-13T15:07:22.135+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"* First off, don't be scared to try to play ranked, but make sure you are comfortable too, I would advise not going straight into ranked and getting more familiar with the game\n* Try to get a position you are comfortable with and a champion suited to that position\n* You get matched up with people of your skill level (Everyone thinks they are better than each other)\n* It does have a lot more ragers and toxic players, but that is because people want to get to a higher rank unlike normals. If you encounter these people don't bother and just mute them.\n* Lastly have fun :) feel free to add me in game if you want some tips\n-Artic","replies":[]},{"poster":"RNG Remilia","date":"2015-05-13T17:30:31.937+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"1.
