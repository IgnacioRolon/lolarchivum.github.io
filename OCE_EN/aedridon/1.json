I thought it would be cool if that guy became a champion. He seems to be an ally with the Shadow Isles so I made him like that. I did not add the numbers (costs, cd etc) and the abilities may not be very well thought out. I sort of put a bunch of ideas together. If you guys have any ideas or feedback leave a comment and I&#039;ll update according to said feedback.**\n\nRevalv, The Puppeteer Of Terror\n\nRole: Mage\n\nAbilities: \n\nInstead of Mana, Revalv uses Necromancy as his secondary resource. He uses Necromancy in casting and amplifying his abilities. \n\n__Passive: The Black Mist__\nRevalv gains 5 Necromancy whenever he attacks a unit and 10 Necromancy whenever he kills a unit. He restores 50% of his current Necromancy whenever he gains a Champion kill or assist. Staying out of combat will start a decay on the Necromancy. \n\nWith every point of Necromancy, the Black Mist Shields him, reducing crowd control effects by 0.1%. Tenacity will stack with this effect. At max Mystic, he gains a shield based of his current HP for a duration. \n\n__Q Ability: Dark Reanimation__\n> Necromancy Cost: 50/45/40/35/30\nCooldown: 12/10/8/6/6\nMagic Damage: 30/60/90/120/150 (+50% AP)\nStats of Harrowed Puppet: 10% HP, Armour, Magic Resist. \n50% Movement and Attack Speed \n70% AD\nMovement and Attack Speed bonus: 50% of current Speeds\n\nRevalv spreads the Black Mist to target area, spawning a Harrowed Puppet and dealing Magic Damage to all enemies in the area. If an enemy is killed in the target area, the Necromancy cost is refunded by 50%. \n\nA Harrowed Puppet lasts for a duration and has stats equivalent to a percentage of Revalv's stats. Harrowed Puppets target whoever Revalv is attacking and are used in casting Revalv's other abilities. Harrowed Puppets gain Movement and Attack Speed when moving towards and attacking Harrowed targets respectively. They also are attracted to Harrowed targets \n\n__W Ability: Cold Fear__\n>Necromancy Cost: 40\nCooldown: 16/14/12/10/8\nMagic Damage: 60/100/140/180/220 (+50% AP) \nFear Duration: 0.5/0.75/1/1.25/1.5s\nHarrow Mark Duration: 3s\nSecondary Necromancy Cost: 30\nMark Magic Damage: 90% of damage dealt by Harrowed Puppets \n\nRevalv sends the Black Mist forward in a straight line, dealing Magic Damage to all enemies hit. If this ability hits an enemy Champion, the projectile stops and the enemy Champion is feared and marked with Harrowed for a duration. Revalv can then consume Necromancy to recast this ability, causing the mark to explode, dealing Magic Damage based on the damage dealt by the Harrowed Puppets.\n\n__E Ability: Cut The Strings__\n>Necromancy Cost: 45\nCooldown: 12/10/8/6/6\nMagic Damage: 40/70/100/130/160 (+75% AP)\nSlow %: 40%\nSlow Duration: 2.5s\n\nRevalv cuts the life force of target Harrowed Puppet, sending it into a frenzy, launching itself at target area, dealing Magic Damage to all enemies hit and slowing them for a duration. The Harrowed Puppet then dies. \n\n__Ultimate: The Harrowing__\n\n>Necromancy Cost: 0\nCooldown: 120/100/80\nMagic Damage per tendril: 80/180/280 (+75% AP)\nNo. of Harrowed Puppets spawned: 1/2/3\nMark Magic Damage: 80/160/240 (+20% AP) (+90% of damage dealt by Harrowed Puppets)\n\nRevalv sends 5 tendrils of the Black Mist towards target enemy Champion, each dealing Magic Damage. The first tendril will apply Harrowed. This Harrowed mark will automatically explode, dealing Magic Damage. Revalv automatically spawns Harrowed Puppets.

Mystic sounds like a dodgy resource name though. Anyway, this set of abilities seems that his only fighting potential is when he is near minions/monsters or the lucky kill on an enemy champ.. One more thing: you'll notice Riot are slowly getting rid of fears and silences... No clue why but this guy has 2 in his kit.. That's pretty randomly strong.","replies":[{"poster":"Aedridon","date":"2015-04-24T08:44:08.563+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"hmm, yeah I guess Mystic is kinda weird. I'll change it to like something dark and magic-ish, like Necromancy or something. \n\nas i said i just threw a bunch of ideas into this guy so i'll make the proper changes. thanks for the feedback! you came, you saw and you helped :)","replies":[{"poster":"VENI VIDI VICI","date":"2015-04-24T14:43:27.343+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Not bad ideas though man.
