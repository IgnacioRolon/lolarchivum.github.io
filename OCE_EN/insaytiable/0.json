I&#039;ve gotten so mentally strong I can ignore it 99% of the time. \r\nNow, I feel I should mention that I don&#039;t play ranked at all. Why? 3 reasons, blind picked gets into a game faster and I like to experiment with runes and masteries and lastly everyone in norms plays more aggressive, and I like taking advantage of that.\r\n\r\nReason for the post is the game I just played, I was Lux mid against an Ezreal. Long story short, there Shaco camped and ganked the living poop out of me as soon as I went outside my own turret range every time. Nothing wrong with that, legit strategy was legit.\r\nHere&#039;s the kicker though, the verbal harassment that came after each kill from both my team and the enemy team was pretty ruthless this time. If these people had said these things in my vicinity, sadly, I may have become violent. Verbal venom that I would never even say to my worst enemy. I guess I just respect the average human to much.\r\n\r\nPoint is I didn&#039;t say a word the entire game. About halfway through after some very explicit comments from the enemy Tristana I wrote only &quot; :( &quot;  which they then reacted with provocations for me to suicide and what-not. I can&#039;t imagine the sort of people sitting at there computer saying such things. I literally can&#039;t comprehend, I do not compute.\r\n\r\nSomehow, I was warned after the game with a popup for verbal harassment.\r\n\r\nSo this is how bad It has gotten on Oce, the good natured fellas like myself, are being warned and reported for being good natured. And the toxicity is considered normal. It&#039;s become totally backward, and people who play blind pick will know what I&#039;m talking about. It&#039;s in every single game, without fail, every time.\r\n\r\nRiot, respectfully, you have created a great game. But what is going on here? Seriously, This is the worst gaming community I&#039;ve ever played on by a very wide margin. That includes the CoD community, and that&#039;s saying something.\r\n\r\nIf there is a tribunal, it achieves nothing. Because the player base is 75% toxic. As mentioned above, good natured fellas are reported and toxicity is the norm. My best friend and cousin has quit because of this very reason, said he quit straight after he said &quot;GL HF&quot; and proceeded to be flamed for no reason at all.\r\n\r\nAt this point, I doubt it&#039;s going to improve. For example, if 75% of the worlds population had been programmed to treat other people like dirt. If some higher power, god, government, whatever, decided enough was enough and implemented some sort of rule and punishment to stop people being dirt to each other, It wouldn&#039;t change anything. Because the damage is done, the programming is set like concrete into the social culture. This is the biggest issue.\r\n\r\nAnyway, this is my first forum post, and I usually never rant or complain, ever. I&#039;m a quiet, soft spoken, hard working bloke. And I love this game, which is why I&#039;m saying this stuff.\r\n\r\nAnd Happy New Year,\r\n\r\nJay","replies":[{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2015-12-23T01:10:53.873+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Don't worry about it ey. The 'warnings' aren't really warning at all if you have't done anything. All they say is that you've been reported, if you didn't do anything the system will then throw the report out and you have nothing to worry about. The system has it's flaws, but it's smart enough to know that you didn't say anything and that therefore, at the very least it is invalid.\n\nI guess the biggest flaw with the system (well, only because people are losing faith in it and not bothering to report) is that (as far as I'm aware) the system only investigates those who are reported. So if you get reported and the system throws it out that's fine, but the system won't investigate the toxic players who reported you unless you in turn report them (which I imagine you did but I wouldn't know). So many people complain here on boards that 'oh woe is me I've been banned when the other guy was being toxic too' and the simple fact is, if he reported you, and you didn't report him, then you're gonna get looked at and he isn't. And if YOU got punished by the system for that game, chances are the other guy did too.\n\nBeing toxic doesn't make your reports illegitimate/less meaningful to the system. Filing false reports is all that does that. But that's a little off topic. Long story short, you have nothing to worry about, unless you actually did something wrong, the warnings are meaningless.","replies":[]},{"poster":"InSaYtIaBlE","date":"2016-02-27T15:48:38.556+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Bump.\n\nAccused of scripting this time. How flattering.\n\nI was WW. Chasing Tahm Kench and a low health Vayne in our jungle, the narrow corridor inbetween blue and wolves. I'm expecting Tahm to Q, slow me down. He does so, I sidestep it. Ult and finish Vayne, then top arrives from river to help finish Tahm. \n\nWhat followed is our ADC Lucian accusing me of scripting as he didn't believe I was good enough to dodge the Tahm Q. I reply only with \"I'm flattered you think I'm hacking :)\". He then kept bringing it up and threatning to report, which I encouraged him to do and assured him of my legitimate report about his harrasment, he got angrier and angrier it seemed as I replied only with smiley faces.\nHe had also been harassing his support Lulu for what he perceived as bad play when in reality it was just different playstyles. Lulu was more passive while Lucian was ultra aggressive. I started to talk to defend Lulu, who was clearly a decent enough player and doing her best.\n\nEven though we won the game through what was just a difference between the teams in sheer experience. Our team was divided all the way through. Lulu and myself made the reasonable side. Lucian, Riven and Anivia made the intolerant \"I expect you to be psychic and know what I want you to do\" side.\nOnce again, even though we won, it was not an enjoyable experience. It felt like I was having to defend someone being attacked by immature teenagers for no reason at all.\n\nI'm not letting this go, The behavior is childish and backward. Something needs to be done.\n\nI will say, on the bright side. Lulu made my friends list.","replies":[]},{"poster":"CandyVanisClosed","date":"2015-12-24T00:39:54.009+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Been saying this for ages......\nIts a automated system and is open to abuse....","replies":[{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2015-12-24T16:41:46.155+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=CandyVanisClosed,realm=OCE,application-id=Ntey9fRZ,discussion-id=U0mhyRkd,comment-id=0003,timestamp=2015-12-24T00:39:54.009+0000)\n>\n> Been saying this for ages......\n> Its a automated system and is open to abuse....\n\nThat would imply he actually got punished, he didn't. If he didn't say anything then the report has been thrown out and nothing will come of it, i.e it hasn't been abused because it can't in this way.

Basically kids these days haven't been taught the value of respect, so they can sit behind a computer and say anything and think its fine.\n\nDon't worry though, apparently false verbal warnings are dealt with by Riot (let's hope). A lot of people are reporting falsely these days, because they also think they can get away with that.\n\nAt lower elos, in many games, people try to compensate for the lack of skill by other means. And in some of those activities, whatever advice you offer goes over their head. If they are not playing to **improve** then that advice is a waste of time. If you find that your offers of help are being ignored, just mute them, they are not worth your time.\n\nGood luck!","replies":[]},{"poster":"The Ball","date":"2015-12-22T19:22:42.318+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"i haven't read this but ill let you know i got 5-6 verbal abuse warnings in a row, from never once using offensive language or harassing anyone, in actual fact they were doing it to me. this was about 3 weeks ago, nothing has happened since.\n\nsomeone once said to me \"you are the reason the community is ruined\" - I laughed","replies":[]}]}
