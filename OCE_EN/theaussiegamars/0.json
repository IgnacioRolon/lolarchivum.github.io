His passive would be a cogwheel, His Q would charge up with steam then shoot out his tongue, His W would eat them(like always) and clamp shut his mouth, whilst grinding up the thing he ate with cogs in his stomach, His E would use a magnetic force field, and his ult would pull up a future like grid (like form the creator viktor back) and then he would start to fade away and then teleport to the location using some sort of teleportation machine. I think that would be a good idea for a skin","replies":[{"poster":"Reported4Verbal","date":"2016-02-08T09:45:10.616+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"{{champion:223}} {{champion:223}} {{champion:223}} {{champion:223}} {{champion:223}} {{item:3010}}","replies":[]}]}
