Something a bit different and pretty far away from my normal \"musical Theater\" style singing. I loved this song when it was written and performed by Imagine Dragons, at the League of Legends World Cup 2014. So I give you my cover of it. :)","url":"https://soundcloud.com/rikki-pool/warriors-imagine-dragons-cover","image":"http://a1.sndcdn.com/images/fb_placeholder.png?1454494860"},"up_votes":4,"down_votes":1,"body":"Hey everyone!\r\n\r\nI just finished recording myself singing the amazing song from the 2014 Word Championships. \r\n\r\nPlease let me know what you think. This is a completely different style for me, as I generally sing Musical Theater based stuff.","replies":[{"poster":"Fitzky","date":"2016-02-04T07:23:03.489+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"This is my personal opinion so how you take it is up to you; the start was great, you hit the right notes and it sounded perfect. However, when you reached the chorus, you were off the entire time. Maybe I'm just use to Imagine Dragons singing it but I personally didn't like that bit.","replies":[{"poster":"MajorPool","date":"2016-02-04T08:03:48.970+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thank you for your feedback. :)\n\nLining up my voice with the lead singer of ID, we are singing the same pitch, it does sound different however as I am a natural Baritone. So singing up this high is very straining and will sound different. \n\nAgain though, thank you for your feedback. :)","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"MasterMirkinen","date":"2016-02-04T22:16:27.543+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I actually quite like it!\nAnd thanks for bringing back the memories from S4 :)","replies":[{"poster":"MajorPool","date":"2016-02-05T07:19:38.892+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"A compliment and a reply from a Rioter! \n\nWhy thank you very much!! :)\n\nAny more Rioters lurking around I wonder...","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Junko","date":"2016-02-04T22:56:03.466+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"{{sticker:slayer-jinx-wink}} I really like this!
