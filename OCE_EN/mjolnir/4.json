Many many people wouldn't have even bought Ornn in the first week, and will yolo play it in ranked anyway. (without seeing gameplay) It's much like int feeders and trolls, it is 50/50 and you do have a ban to use yourself in every game so you can't really complain. If you don't want people in your game playing it, ban it. \n{{sticker:slayer-jinx-catface}} \n{{sticker:slayer-jinx-wink}}","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Nightjar","date":"2017-08-24T05:24:11.648+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"imo 1 week would be fairer but this idea seems great.","replies":[]}]}
