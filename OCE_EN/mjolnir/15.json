I'm a Gold/Plat player in NA, and a Silver player in OCE. Unfortunately,  I don't really have any experience with editing to show, as I've only messed around on Sony Vegas and Adobe After Effects. I don't claim to be the best editor, but I'll try my best if you would like me to help you. Onviously,  with my limited skills I would not be asking for money, I'd solely be doing it for the experience. Thanks for taking the time to read this, and if you need to know anything just ask me. Have a great day!\n\nYours sincerely, \nTalwyn","replies":[{"poster":"Mjolnir","date":"2017-05-27T06:58:18.449+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey mate!\n \nI've added you on league and I wouldn't mind talking with you about all this in a more real time matter!\nI'll give you a few things to start off with if this takes off and we'll see what you're made of!\n\nFrom, \nGnarmy","replies":[]}]}]}
