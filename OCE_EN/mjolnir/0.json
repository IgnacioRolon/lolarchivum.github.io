I have been apart of Rainbow Six Siege and Smite teams to help improve my communication and leadership as a player. I have developed my passion and dedication to the game I wish to invest my remaining few young years of my life before I start to slow down and pursue a career in I.T or Coaching.\r\n\r\nNow to show you all who are wanting to join in the resurrection of **Notorious eSports** I want give you all the chance to join us as long as you&#039;re Diamond 5+ and have the dedication to show me you&#039;re willing to go the distance. \r\n\r\nFill out this application if you wish to improve and keep on improving to show OCE we&#039;re not just a joke.\r\n**https://goo.gl/forms/lGxJjVhwOQVHkhh42**\r\n\r\n\r\n[](https://imgur.com/a/RWxyF)","replies":[{"poster":"Transcender","date":"2018-01-08T06:18:01.551+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":9,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Hopë ,realm=OCE,application-id=mR0UmRrp,discussion-id=R9x4kIkB,comment-id=,timestamp=2018-01-08T05:51:33.113+0000)\n> \"I want give you **ALL** the chance to join us\" \"**AS LONG AS** you&amp;#039;re Diamond 5+ and have the dedication to show me you&amp;#039;re willing to go the distance.\"\n\nWas the chance for me to join gone the moment you said \"as long as\"?\n\nANYONE can join as long as they are this specific race colour gender and sexuality.\n\nCan't just get our hopes up like that and then pull the chair out from underneath us.","replies":[{"poster":"Mjolnir","date":"2018-01-08T06:46:37.005+0000","up_votes":7,"down_votes":0,"body":"Life isn't fair to everyone, Work harder and you'll get to that point where you can get that chance.

I already consistently perform against those players you will be trialing. Difference is in a team, players are not/shouldn't be climbing over each other taking each others shit, trying to carry the game where as that is the definition of solo queue. Funny thing is whoever does it the worst usually wins.\n\nThen again I doubt you would want me because you wouldn't be able to understand what I do.\n\nMaybe this resurrection won't be full of the same type of players, there is always Hopë.","replies":[{"poster":"foon","date":"2018-01-08T06:56:18.283+0000","up_votes":7,"down_votes":0,"body":"Git Gud kid","replies":[]},{"poster":"Ingénue","date":"2018-01-08T09:17:30.509+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"If you truly believe that you are up to this standard, you can always start your own team and prove everybody wrong.","replies":[{"poster":"Transcender","date":"2018-01-08T09:26:53.115+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":3,"body":"I couldn't find anyone from bronze to challenger who could correctly execute the strats.\n\nSo it is irrelevant if I am up to this standard or not as it is a team game and therefore until I have players who can execute my strats correctly, I am not going to be proving anyone wrong. Since everyone thinks it is a troll strategy they never attempt it seriously. So no one can disprove it and I can't prove it.\n\nI can however prove that I am diamond 1 player in starcraft 2, not because of my rank but because I can consistently play to that level, which the rank reflects as it is a 1v1 ranking system in a 1v1 game.","replies":[{"poster":"Maoi","date":"2018-01-08T10:51:01.404+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"You're actually the OCE Hashinshin","replies":[{"poster":"Transcender","date":"2018-01-08T11:43:32.129+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":5,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Adriette,realm=OCE,application-id=mR0UmRrp,discussion-id=R9x4kIkB,comment-id=000000000000000100000001,timestamp=2018-01-08T10:51:01.404+0000)\n>\n> You&#x27;re actually the OCE Hashinshin\n\nCare to share what you think the similarities are?\n\nI have only seen 1 game and his team didn't play too bad and his entire team wasn't shit talking him while playing with their pants over their head.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Vaynest","date":"2018-01-08T09:58:18.924+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"you're just a meme at this point xD","replies":[{"poster":"Transcender","date":"2018-01-08T12:04:59.342+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":4,"body":"Exactly, no one who could correctly execute it would even humour the idea, too busy with their heads up their own arse to consider the possibility of a very thoroughly thought out strategy designed from the ground up to have 0 counter play when executed correctly.\n\nTheir reasoning is \"oh well the pro's didn't make it so it must be shit\" not actually realising that the system they climbed on is mathematically flawed and disproves itself as a functional ability indicator. All I have been doing is trying to show what is blatantly obvious in case everyone had just been missing information or something, I didn't actually know it was a \"we have the information but are trying to put squares in the circle holes\" kind of situation.\n\nSo, because riot is still publishing these articles that specifically imply that if you improve then you will climb bullshit. Everyone still eats it up and anything that looks out of sort like a challenger smurf being stuck in diamond for a year, or a masters player being stuck in gold, gets instantly titled as boosted players when 99/100 of them did not get an external party to play on their account.\n\nIt is like people who think the Earth is still flat and have come up with all this made up shit without any proof to try and cover up any holes in their theory.","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Iudex Gundyr","date":"2018-01-09T17:24:24.180+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":">\"I already consistently perform against those players you will be trialing\"\n\n[LINK REMOVED] ???\n\nWhy did you wintrade for kda too?\n\n[LINK REMOVED]","replies":[{"poster":"Transcender","date":"2018-01-09T22:37:11.249+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":4,"body":"I didn't  _**win**_ trade for kda.\n\nand still almost lost one of those because my teammates are inept.\n\nIf I wanted to kda farm, which I will pretty much be doing on one of my accounts for the new season in my statistical analysis but not by win trading, I would not have such shitty kda.\n\nOn another note have you found the equation to prove me wrong yet since everyone apparently knows it?","replies":[{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2018-01-10T04:01:34.756+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"So you didn't **_win_** trade heaven forbid but you kda farmed (cheating) and basically threw games (griefing) and intend to continue to do so this season?","replies":[{"poster":"Transcender","date":"2018-01-10T05:36:38.878+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"Found out it is not sustainable due to not being able to get into a game with the same accounts, we did it for like 10 games.

I have had the same person on my team 3 games in a row who were purposely trying to lose the game. The 1000's upon 1000's of games where my teammates were griefing and inting, I never got compensated for. So to me, the justice still hasn't been served for me.
