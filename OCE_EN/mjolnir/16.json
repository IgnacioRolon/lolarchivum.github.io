I mean Riot could do it and make quite a bit of money to keep League of Legends f2p and everything.\r\n\r\nThey have the lore, RuneTera and everything to make it if they wanted to xD","replies":[{"poster":"Miicka","date":"2016-11-23T11:48:22.984+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Nah. I'd rather them keep spending money on this game. Look, the lore is cool and all, but quite frankly idgaf about that stuff I just wanna play some league and have fun.\n\nIt might be a good idea for Telltale games to make a spin off or something, but even then, MMOs and MOBAs are very different types of game. I don't know if many people who actually play LoL would even bother downloading this game.","replies":[]}]}
