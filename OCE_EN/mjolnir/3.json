The thing about my stream is I want people to come in and feel  comfortable with saying what they want (mostly) and not be tied down by social standards of stupid words that society gives meaning to because they are \"bad\". Being vulgar is who i am and how I grew up in the household and I'm not going to change unless it affects me. The thing is, I'm not plat 3 anymore, I'm plat 1 and I love what I say and do and others seem to love it as well otherwise i wouldn't have 109 followers.","replies":[]}]}]}
