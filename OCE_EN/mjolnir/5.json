Hoping to climb higher though.\n\nA little bit about yourself: I live in Melbourne and working at a hotel in the CBD where I have a pretty decent paying job as a waiter.

I have 6 hours of flight time in my pilots log book and hoping to add more hours to be able to actually fly haha. I'm casual when it comes to gaming unless I'm motivated.
