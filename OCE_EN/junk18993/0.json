Secondly, I can't trust you are being truthful about your attitude in-game. You have a biased view point on the matter, naturally you are going to think you aren't as bad as you actually are (even think there isn't a problem when there is).

I think it was Phreak that said something like if you started your account selecting \"beginner\" as compared to \"expert\" you would get placed lower after ranked provisionals. But yeah from viewing games I can see that there's not much difference in skill between bronze and silver. Theres usually two scenarios in these lower leagues: game is either a complete stomping, or its just a chasefest where whoever gets the baron wins the game. People in higher tiers have better mechanics and **sometimes** better decision making. But in solo queue on the OCE server it seems to be just a slugfest with no real strategy. I haven't seen a single game where a team wards an objective **well in advance** in preparation to take it, like the pros do. From what I've seen from OCE solo queue viewing, people under challenger level just don't have a good grasp of strategy.\n\nAnyone can be a \"godlike hero\" with mechanics, but if they are not a team player, and the opposition play as a team, then its most likely the \"hero\" will lose.\n\n> The ranking system is just horrible and makes no sense at all. Really wish Riot would do something about it cause it&#039;s so stupid and annoying.\n\nI would agree with this. Using a ranking system that was designed for a solo player game is foolhardy. Because league is about teamwork, and if you are using this formula to rank people based on how their teammates perform then its just not going to be accurate. Perhaps a better ranking system would include some stats like your average KDA from the game, objectives taken or assisted, etc, in addition to the current \"mmr\" system. \n\nI can understand why he would be frustrated, if he is a better player, but is being held back by noob teammates who don't understand the game so well. People are now going to say \"well if he is better he should be carry the game\", but **how much** better does he have to be to carry the game? Because lets say he is playing at silver level but his teammates are not working as a team then he has no chance to carry a bronze game. If the ranking system was fixed, then he would be placed into a proper skill tier, where games would not only be challenging but **enjoyable**.","replies":[{"poster":"Project Xayah","date":"2015-08-19T05:35:47.342+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":">Because lets say he is playing at silver level but his teammates are not working as a team then he has no chance to carry a bronze game.\n\nLet's assume this is the case. Firstly, it's stand to reason that most (if no all) games are this situation (as is the standard excuse [yes, it's an excuse]). Secondly, considering all 10 players in a single match are picked from the same pool of players, it stands to reason this same situation occurs **just as often** (within a negligible margin of error) for the opposing teams. Given that, it stands to reason that the player in question (in this case, OP) should be doing as much winning as losing from this scenario and it actually has minimal to no effect on how the matchmaking works.\nBasically: It's true, bad teammates are a problem ***for individual games*** however they have minimal to no effect on where a player ends up in the long term.","replies":[{"poster":"Onray","date":"2016-01-19T00:30:16.221+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=HeartVine,realm=OCE,application-id=FjGAIbRv,discussion-id=N2sbGzqI,comment-id=00030000,timestamp=2015-08-19T05:35:47.342+0000)\n>\n> Basically: It's true, bad teammates are a problem ***for individual games*** however they have minimal to no effect on where a player ends up in the long term.\n\nSure from a **large sample size** of that players games, in the long term it has no effect. However this means that the silver player has to grind out thousands of games to get to where he should belong in the first place. Also on various days he could be winning a lot of games, and then on other days he could be losing a lot of games. I.e. his rating is **mostly** dependent on other people.\n\nScenario\n\nGame 1: Team feeds, loss\nGames 2: Stomping, win\nGame 3: Someone afks, loss\n\n....\n\nWhat I'm saying is that surely there is a better way to rank people. Skill is not just based on who wins and who loses a game. Especially in a team game. You could be the best cricketer in the world and your team still loses, e.g. Brian Lara didn't always have a great team, despite being a god at batting.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"junk18993","date":"2015-09-15T17:41:39.658+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Anyways, I've finally managed to climb up and I'm currently in Gold 4 100LP.
