The user has verified his email onto my account (i forgot to verify) and through this, was able to then buy $300 worth of RP that has been charged straight to my credit card. Do you think Riot will be able to reverse my account to when I last had access to it? Do you think Riot will also be able to refund my money and refund whatever RP was used after I had access to it (roughly 38k+ RP)?","replies":[{"poster":"SephirothSG","date":"2016-03-26T08:08:39.244+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey there,\n\nRiot has a specific department for fraud, as it's around the weekend (And easter!) they may be a little slow in replying, don't be alarmed.\n\nYes, if your account was indeed compromised all actions taken on the account should be reversed (After the investigation is complete) and your money refunded.\n\nIn short, just wait it out.
