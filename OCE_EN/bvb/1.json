Ive been playing for 3+ years at various levels. Just came back a couple months ago from a year long break. I enjoy playing competitively but Im fairly relaxed about results. Im flexible across all lanes, but Id prefer to play either Top, Mid, or JG. I can play a pretty decent pool of champs, and Im happy to learn new champs that suit the team as well. I have Skype but Id be fine using Teamspeak or something else. Im fairly flexible for times, especially during the weekend for games/practice. If you want to get in touch, feel free to add me (BVB). Let me know if Ive missed any info.\r\nThanks :)","replies":[]}
