The players we already have play various roles, and so the rotation of roles is probably a target.  Ideally players who are silver/gold.\r\nSkype and being free to play most evenings would be perfect, although we're able to sort things like that out.\r\n\r\nFeel free to message me in -game: BVB","replies":[{"poster":"StroudWing","date":"2015-03-20T09:02:49.106+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'm silver 1 and can play any role.
