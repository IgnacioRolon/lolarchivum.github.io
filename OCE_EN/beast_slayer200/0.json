Kayn was only released 2 patches ago and now you&#039;ve released another one (Ornn) on to the PBE WITH THE URGOT REWORK IN BETWEEN THAT. I&#039;m just afraid riot aren&#039;t putting as much effort into their champions and are leaning slowly towards quantity over quality. Now, look if riot can make a champion every like 4th patch and make that champion in-depth fun to play satisfying and feel like that they fit into Runeterra than that would be incredible. But in saying that I would just hate to see Riot feel the pressure to mass produce basic and unsatisfying champions to keep people interested in their game. I just hope they have a clear vision of where they want to take this game.\r\n\r\nRegards,\r\nBeast","replies":[{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2017-08-10T01:06:01.539+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"They have multiple teams working on champions and skins at any one time. It's not a matter of less effort, but more a matter of schedules lining up (or in this case not). More than likely a complex champion like Kayn took a little bit longer than the usual schedule and thus was released a little late, and Ornn is just being released right on time.\n\nI'd much rather they take the time to complete things properly as they have done than rush things just to meet some arbitrary schedule, which is precisely why they don't have one for champion releases. The fact they mentioned a specific patch (as opposed to \"around\" one) for Ornn and the fact that we got his gameplay pretty much straight away speaks to me that he was probably ready very soon after Kayn and they just delayed it a bit so as not to overload players.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Gesteppie","date":"2017-08-11T00:59:06.623+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It would be nice if Rito took a break on champion releases for 6 months or so, and just devoted themselves to fixing and balancing the game.
