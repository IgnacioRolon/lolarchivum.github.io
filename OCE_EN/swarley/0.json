I don&#039;t play that often.\r\n\r\nBasically I&#039;ve been placed in lower priority queue because I disconnect more than I should due to crumby internet in the evenings. I&#039;m fine with the penalties of a 20 minute wait but the problem is after waiting the 20 minutes it never connects to a game. How am I supposed to play out these 5 penalty games without actually ever being able to join a game??\r\n\r\nI&#039;ve waited the 20 minute penalty plus another 30 minutes 3 times now and I still don&#039;t get put through to champion select.\r\n\r\nNow I only play ARAM because I just enjoy having fun and only DC due to unforeseeable net issues. \r\n\r\nI&#039;d really like you to look into this because I&#039;d like to get these penalty queues over with. (again the problem is you literally can&#039;t)\r\n\r\nCould you also think about throwing in compensation? Because your 20 minute waiting times are actually infinite because I haven&#039;t been able to join a game at all. Just wave the penalties.\r\n\r\nMy IGN is Swarley. Thank you./\r\n{{champion:56}}","replies":[{"poster":"HORSE OF FORCE","date":"2015-05-31T02:13:27.952+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It's against policy to remove any penalties given out by the system, under any circumstances. If you're experiencing troubles connecting to 'Active game's, then you should probably repair/upgrade your internet connection. What ISP are you with, and how are you connected to the net?","replies":[]}]}
