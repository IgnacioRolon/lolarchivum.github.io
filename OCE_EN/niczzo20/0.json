That's true it has been for a while. I think it was added in the middle of last year. But compared to how long I have been playing, it's been here for a while. For me, it is just a useless feature that riot decided to waste their time and focus on. Riot focussed on something that they didn't need to because there are already features that help identifies if a person is ingame or not.\n\n* The colours change based on the activity of the player.\nRed = Away or afk\nGreen = Online\nBlue = In queue or ingame\n* Also hovering is very useful because it shows a lot of information.\nLevel of person\nCharacter that is being played\nActual status: ingame (game mode, time, ranked or normal)\ncustom status\n* Messaging a friend to ask if they're ingame by using league chat is also a feature btw.\n\nMaybe its just my client idk.\n\nTrue. But if I didn't know who I wanted to play and can't choose, ain't it a better idea to play someone random and also have a chance of earning a s chest.\n\nI don't know about you but I used to be able to. Must be the recent league friends/chat problem. I know because I used to do this for a very long time. There's still a problem to this day. Also can't use the moblie league chat because of it. Sad thing is that I can't change my status on the mobile app :(\n{{sticker:zombie-nunu-tears}}\ntbh I liked the old client cause it was less buggy and had fewer issues even though it doesn't look as nice as the current one. \n\nAlso the cropping in the league loading ingame screen crops the icons a considerable amount.","replies":[{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2020-01-22T02:43:42.154+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"We're getting pretty off-topic here.
