Its seems a bit over the top to give me 20 points for a pretty standard win and proceed to take 25+ for a loss with an afk player and intentional feeders (as an example). There doesn't seem to be much of a connection between play standard and the system as much as some RNG. Making the scummy climb out of bronze all that much more annoying.

If your MMR is much higher than your enemy team's average MMR, you'll get less from a win, and lose a lot more. If your MMR is lower, you gain more and lose less.\nOn another note, if you're good enough to get out of bronze, you will eventually. If you're raging and breaking keyboards, you'll stay there for a while. Chill out.","replies":[]}]}
