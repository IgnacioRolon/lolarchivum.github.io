But one idea that hadn't seemed to be utilised yet was that of sabotage. A champion who's entire skillset is based around taking what their opponent brings and making them regret bringing it. And so I got to thinking and drafting and this is what I've come up with so far:\n\n\n**Zartik - The Sabeotuer**\n\nBackground:\n> \"Why can't you be more like Teemo!\" they said. \"Why not follow Tristana's example?\" \"Not everyone can be Heimerdinger...\" They all kept saying things like that. They all kept making fun of him and his desires to learn. Belittling him. Reminding him that he was inferior to them. Calling him fat and lazy. Not even Rumble understood him. No one in Bandle City did. Zartik had his own plans though. He would see his revenge. On all of them. He would use everything they threw at him and return it 10 fold. They would rue the day they chided Zartik. They worshipped Teemo, did they? Zartik would take their legendary hero and show them all just how much less of a yordle he was. He would take to the Fields of Justice and bring them all to their knees. And then, he would be the one laughing.\n\nPassive: **Wrong target**\nEvery 5th ability/aa landed on Zartik returns *5/7/10% *of dmg taken and heals Zartik for *3/4/5%* of max hp\n\nQ) **What was that?**\n60/70/80/90/100 mana CD 15/14/13/12/11s\nDisables target enemy champion's last used ability for* 3/3.5/4/4.5/5s *and deals *50/55/60/65/70%* of the dmg that ability would deal as the type of dmg it would deal. If last ability dealt damage over time, *50/55/60/65/70%* of the total possible dmg is dealt.\n\nW) **Are you there?**\n10/9/8/7/6% of mana CD 30s at all ranks\nDrops a 30s candle ward (not stealthed) at target location with 3hp. Returns *%6/7/8/9/10 *of dmg recieved back as magic dmg.\nIf dropped in a bush, sets bush on fire dealing *18/21/24/27/30%hp* as magic dmg over 3s to all champions in the bush (allied included), but consumes ward immediately. Vision granted is lost after 5s\n\nE) **Feeling Thirsty?**\n50/60/70/80/90 mana CD 10/9.5/9/8.5/8s\nDestroys  [*15/17/20/23/25%* + 5% of Zartik's max mana pool] of target enemy champion's maximum mana pool and increases target's cooldowns by *1/1.5/2/2.5/3s*\n\nR) **Wanna trade?**\n150mana at all ranks CD 120/100/80s\nSwaps all bonus stats between target enemy champion and Zartik excluding hp & mana for *5/6/7s*.\n\n\nNow this is still fairly early in the thought process department...  I had envisioned him as being either a support or a tank, but am open to suggestion if anyone has any bright ideas. His base stats would probably be similar to blitzcrank maybe? Not too sure... I was thinking he'd look like a  fat gremlin yordle... perhaps something like this: [linky link](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-LxBMveW09iU/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAEg/6mQyqDt2ekQ/photo.jpg). And just for the lols, when he casts ult, a small Urf Manatee appears beside targetted champion marking the debuff\n\nJust something I came up with and thought I'd share...

He doesn't need to dmg allied champions with his w - I just put that in to balance it out a little. And if It wasn't clear Q, E & R can only target enemy champions. I'll edit that in though. Also R isn't a permanent debuff... just for a few seconds...","replies":[{"poster":"TechnoFlame","date":"2015-03-04T09:33:19.976+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Proxima Solaris,realm=OCE,application-id=hIjvqaz6,discussion-id=BpH0jzAz,comment-id=00010001,timestamp=2015-03-04T09:31:44.199+0000)\n>\n> Mmm fair enough.

Also do u think sky hook is balenced?","replies":[{"poster":"Chicken4dinner","date":"2015-03-04T10:43:14.660+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You need to snowball maybe 3 of zer0's active abilities into one passive as it is too much of a duelist thing, not even xin Zhao has that much duelling focus with his abilities but I see where you are coming from. a sturdy killer with a powerup kit more diverse then the power ranger's.\n\nHowever, he is an assassin by the sounds of your title yet his armour power up with e and attack speed with ult is unnecessary. what you could try is a debuff (like the way zed does it) that targets one enemy for a period of time allowing you to work your kit on them. the e could stay as it is if you change the q into more of an aggressive attack (master yi and alpha strike). Also as far as im concerned sub zer0 is not a farmer, so his passive can get stuffed with his more essential duelling tools while his q/w/e/r remain his diverse damage dealing kit. btw lower the cooldown on w and make it a Much shorter range otherwise you are teleporting to the edges of the screen. \n\nAnyways keep an identity on your champion so as when ever you think when playing a game, \"crap, it would have gone better if I could have done this\" you can think back to your champion and figure out how it can help stop you from getting into that crappy situation in the first place (stops to breathe). But at the same time look for weaknesses you can exploit in your enemy if you were playing your champ. hope it helps","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"SteamPowerLemon","date":"2015-07-11T08:05:56.353+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It is spelled SABOTEUR not sabeotur","replies":[]},{"poster":"TechnoFlame","date":"2015-03-05T09:44:19.280+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Stats?","replies":[]},{"poster":"Crusader charlie","date":"2015-03-05T01:49:27.049+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I think this is still stuck in the waiting room at the thoughts department.","replies":[]},{"poster":"TechnoFlame","date":"2015-03-04T09:10:13.414+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"U just made a hard case counter gj, maybe we could make some champs together bro Also give him terrible scaling stats, for the ult to really do damage","replies":[]}]}
