This has happened to me every game I&#039;ve played from 24th Jan - now across ranked, normals, and ARAM games\r\n\r\nI set up a custom game to take some screenshots to illustrate the point:\r\n\r\n[http://imgur.com/1AtrO4L](http://imgur.com/1AtrO4L)\r\n\r\n^ in this screenshot, my warding trinket has just come off cooldown, but as you can see, it has not gained a charge that I can use, instead the icon just sits blank for about 10s before gaining a charge\r\n\r\n[http://imgur.com/cOt0Mqk](http://imgur.com/cOt0Mqk)\r\n\r\n^ in this screenshot, Frostqueens has just come off cooldown and I&#039;m spamming 2, but nothing is happening. Again, it takes about 10s before the item is actually usable. \r\n\r\n\r\nThis first happened to me in a ranked game and really threw me off. I&#039;ve been hesitant to play ranked while this bug is affecting me... I&#039;ve tried restarting my client, my computer, playing multiple different champions, running different masteries... nothing seems to prevent the bug... I had put in a support ticket and they suggested I post a copy of this thread here too. Hope nobody else is being significantly affected.","replies":[{"poster":"JasonWazza","date":"2016-01-25T17:04:01.783+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Not something i have noticed personally, but then again i haven't played a full out game of support in at least 2 weeks (my support games i have several actives and would notice this instantly)\n\nUnless you're told otherwise from someone else that will test it (i can't right now) that this isn't happening, you may need to repair your client if it's a personal bug.","replies":[{"poster":"Proxima Solaris","date":"2016-01-26T02:08:01.886+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"tried repairing, bug persists. :(","replies":[]}]}]}
