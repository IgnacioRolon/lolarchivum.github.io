I can log in fine and use the store without any issues, but when I try to connect to games I keep getting hit with the &quot;unable to connect to the server&quot; error. If I persist with waiting and just continuously retrying it eventually lets me connect though sometimes this has taken upwards of 6-7 minutes. I used to get this error like 9 months ago and ever since had swapped to launching the client in admin mode and using the admin version of the executable which had seemingly fixed the problem. Nothing has changed at my end set up wise, but this has been getting really annoying so I thought I&#039;d ask if this was something others were also having problems with? Is it something server side like too many people wanting to play URF?","replies":[{"poster":"Netop","date":"2015-05-02T22:33:59.570+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Sorry for the late response, I had the same issue recently, and found out how to fix it.
