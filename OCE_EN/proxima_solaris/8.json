So to deal with this I was wondering if a &quot;Last played with&quot; infobit could be added to the dialog popup that shows when you hover over someone in your friend list. Something small that said something like:\r\n&gt; &quot;You last played with Faker on 24/7/16. Faker played Le Blanc. Faker was known as Hide on Bush then.&quot;\r\n\r\nI would love it if a feature like this could be added to the client. Perhaps something to add into the new LCU?\r\n\r\nAnyways, good luck with the games all!","replies":[]}
