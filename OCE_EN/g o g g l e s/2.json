And while I was on this climb I found myself still abusing these idiots who were losing me the game, and trolling just because they can. I then thought to myself &quot;Im going to get a chat restriction ban&quot;, but I thought it was worth it, in expense of me letting out my anger and climbing to platinum (which I ended up doing). By the time I got to platinum I had a 25 game chat restriction, but omg I still thought that it was worth all the pain I went through. A week goes by and I had completed the 25 game chat restriction, and I come across someone who has bought their account and losing me the game into plat 4. I then continued to do what I did in my other games, and questioned them in a way that was kind of rude. Without thinking anything of it, after the game, I was banned for 14 days. What the ****. I didnt even get a 2 day ban, or a 7 day ban. Boom, straight to 14. After these 14 days go by I had to teach myself to not get angry anymore because it would lead me to a perma ban. So i did. Now let me talk about my account for a minute. i have been playing since season 3, have never raged until this past month where i decided to climb up the ranks, have every single rune you can buy, have nearly 2 skins for every champ. Thats ******* impressive. Anyways back to the story, I get in a game after my 14 day ban, and I come across a troll within the first week. I could not help but call them a noob. I am so sorry for calling a troll a noob. I should of told them they were doing an awesome job of abusing my team and intentionally feeding. But i coudlnt help myself to call them a noob. So i rightfully did. \r\nNext thing I know i get out of the game, and I get an email saying I have been permanently banned. My season 3 account with every rune you can comprehend, nearly every skin has been banned for ever. Im sorry but the problem starts when they did not warn me about my behaviour after the 25 day chat restriction. I really think you should have given me a 1 day ban or a 2 day ban after that restriction Riot. And yes I know i shouldnt have raged, but I raged at the expense of the wall i sit next to.\r\nMy question is, can riot perma bann me without giving me a 1 day or 2 day ban before this. \r\n:)","replies":[{"poster":"SephirothSG","date":"2016-02-03T09:27:59.408+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey there,\n\nYes Riot can enforce the punishments that they see fit.\n\nI personally feel a 25 game chat restriction and a 14 day ban was more than enough warning, in fact rather lenient on their part, you wouldn't have been permanently banned just for calling one player a noob.\n\nRiot normally doesn't revoke bans unless they were made in error.","replies":[{"poster":"G o g g l e s","date":"2016-02-03T09:29:35.342+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"True","replies":[]}]}]}
