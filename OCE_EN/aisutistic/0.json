I&#039;m very tilted and calling this guy out anyways I knew I was gonna get perma banned but I would just like the one who actually tried to lose us the game to also be punished because I believe what he was doing to be worse but I&#039;m the only one who gets punished since only I typed.\r\n\r\nChat log: https://pastebin.com/JyHxXdMH\r\nSnippet of me calling it: https://puu.sh/zgsIC/c03e4b1f17.png","replies":[{"poster":"Joiksu","date":"2018-02-06T06:49:03.717+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Welcome to D5 OCE, the land of trolls, monkeys and boosted idiots.
