I don't really care what I lane I play, I prefer the others to have a role they feel comfortable with compared to being forced to play something.\r\n\r\nI play most ADC's and Supports. I have quite a variety of mid laners I can play should I choose, top lane is solid as well. Jungle would be my only weak point, I haven't had many problems with farming or dying, it's mostly just my lack of understandings for pathings. I used to play a heavy counter jungler a while back, I still haven't lost that vibe and it tends to effect my choices for the worst.\r\n\r\nI don't mind what rank you are, something at least gold+ would probably work best as it makes sure that the teams aren't imbalanced. Anything below silver I would probably rather just switch to my smurf (which I'm sick of as it doesn't have many champions)\r\n\r\nSkype would be nice, although I don't always feel like talking as I sometimes just enjoy listening to music. Most of the time we could chat, I don't mind.\r\n\r\nIf you're interested just sent me a friend request on league, I'll be on for a while longer and probably all day tomorrow.\r\n\r\nAs for the Ranked 5's team side of things, I can play whatever really, either a solo lane or bot lane would be preferable. I'm comfortable on most picks and willing to learn champions suited to team compositions. Again, add me on league if there's any interest.","replies":[{"poster":" Ë†Sherwin","date":"2014-12-30T05:22:25.401+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hi there, I am currently in the process of forming a semi serious team.
