I prefer to play Mid or ADC most of the time, but switch it up to support sometimes. Happy to play anything but jungle and usually dislike playing top lane. Looking for someone to Duo Q with, play a few games to see if we mesh well and go from there.\r\n\r\nI play most days, usually from 5pm onwards. Would prefer to use Discord for voice chat as that's half the fun of playing with someone, but if we play well together and you prefer not to voice chat, I can't complain. Don't mind what role you play.\r\n\r\nJust hit me up in-game and we can see how it goes.\r\n\r\nCheers.","replies":[]}
