With these changes, Boards Volunteers will have moderation abilities and can deal with any reports as appropriate. Volunteers aren't limited to the confines of the standard workday, which allows for faster responses to both posts that are and aren't reported (although your reports will definitely help catch anything that we miss!). Lastly, if you have any questions or comments about moderation, you can post them within the [**Player Behaviour**](http://boards.oce.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/player-behaviour) sub-boards, or continue to submit your requests via ticket. We'll provide you with as much visibility as possible. \n\nTo kick off the revamped moderation, I've gone through and deleted 18 \"Facebook Video\" scam links over the past hour and will do another sweep later today. We want to emphasise that you familiarise yourself with the [**Boards Universal Rules**](http://boards.oce.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/announcements/BjArMH2B-boards-universal-rules) and report posts that violate these rules. \n\nThank you for your patience with this transition, and again, please don&#039;t hesitate to post any questions, comments, or concerns.
