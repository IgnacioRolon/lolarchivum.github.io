Among these changes, automatic and regular syncing has now been implemented into the Boards.\r\n\r\nAs always, your feedback is encouraged and appreciated. Cheers, and let us know what you think!","replies":[{"poster":"Lord Sesshomaru","date":"2018-07-10T04:56:18.847+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"No to be a pessimist, but the new look really isn't as nice as the old one. _(speaking as a Graphic Designer)_\nTheres too much contrast, and it looks too busy because of it, which detracts from the actual content and makes viewing it so much less appealing. \n\nThe older update _(how the boards used to look a couple of days ago)_ was very muted _(perhaps maybe even a little too much)_ but because of its subtly, your eyes could very easily absorb all the information without being strained, which meant longer and more in-depth viewing from the audience. \n\nThis new look is like a slap in the face, too many things vying for your attention _(and most of them are things that shouldn't have your attention anyway, and are just stealing it from the actual content, like the golden borders on everything)_. \n\nHonestly _(true story)_, yesterday morning I opened the boards while eating breakfast _(as I do most days)_, saw the new update, went _\"**Nah!**\"_ and closed the window, and went and opened ESO instead. And thats coming from someone who is committed to these boards. \n\nAlso is that a typeface change on the title? Why? _(or maybe the contrast is just accentuating it)_\nBut a Sans Serif font was much more appropriate for the modern style of the boards, too much serif _(especially on feature text)_ makes it look dated.\n\nWhen the boards contain and convey such a vast amount of information as they do, you want the design to be as minimalistic as possible _(muted colours, sans serif text where possible, etc.)_, now they look too ornate, which just complicates everything, and you don't want unnecessary complexity in the design when your content is already complex.\n\n**[But I will say, it is very nice to have the 'Post' button in brown again! The blue was just a little too subtle. GJ :D]**\n\n\n________________\n\n\n**PS.** _Remember, like usual, my critique is highly perfectionist, I will find flaws in Mother Teresa as well as Adolf Hitler, so just because my feedback is negative, doesn't mean the design isn't still way better than 90% of the rest of forum websites out there! So good job!\n(in saying that though, I still feel very strongly about the contrast, last update was verging perhaps on not enough, this one has definitely gone too far)_","replies":[]}]}
