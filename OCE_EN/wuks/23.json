How long have you been playing?\n\nI dabbled a bit when the game was in beta but a few friends convinced me to start playing with them in season 1. The first game I played was in twisted treeline vs release Xin Zhao and an Evelyn who stacked 6 Sunfire capes and killed me while she was invisible... O u O\nLeague of legends has come a long way ~ although I sometimes miss those early days where every strategy was a new discovery and people weren't afraid to pick random champs in random roles and build random items.","replies":[{"poster":"Wuks","date":"2017-08-10T02:19:16.745+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"# Where does your Summoner Name come from?\n\nWhen i started spamming heimerdinger, I was only also spamming episodes of breaking bad when I noticed the uncanny resemblance between Heimerdingers Hazmat skin and Heisenberg's Hazmat suit.

To date, how many games have you played as him?\n\nI've been playing the game for a very long time ~ and generally like staying away from champions that become popular. At the time I had a bet with my friend that I could make it to challenger playing one of the (perceived to be) weakest champions in the game ~ I think it took me about 300-400 games to first get to challenger. I'm around 2.5k donger games played through all my accounts.","replies":[{"poster":"Wuks","date":"2017-08-10T02:20:28.700+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"# Who is your go-to champion if Heimerdinger gets banned?\n\nRecently, i've been playing the Melee, Physical damage dealing, Tentacle Priestess version of heimerdinger, Illaoi. The split pushing style between them is very similar, although their roles are in teamfights are very different. I've been also enjoying a lot of Yorick (more minions, wooo) and Lissandra.","replies":[{"poster":"Wuks","date":"2017-08-10T02:21:37.592+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"# What runes and masteries do you run on him?\n\nIMO the safest, most general rune page is \nReds     | Magic pen\nYellows | Hp/level\nBlues     | Ap/level\nQuints   | Flat AP\n\nYou can take some armor in yellow or MR in blues if you're scared of a certain lane.\n\n12-18-0 Mastery page.

This is what youâ€™ll want to prioritize:\n\nReaching 45% CDR\nHaving enough mana / mana regen to push and poke\nMagic penetration\nAP\n\nGeneric build =Morelloâ€™s | Sorc Shoes | Liandries | Void staff | Deathcap | *last item* Zonya/Banshee/Rylai\n\nWith blue buff you reach 45% CDR and can still run AP/level blues which are extremely efficient once you have a deathcap. You can decide to buy Rod of Ages/GLP instead of Morello but then youâ€™ll need to run 20% scaling CDR in runes to make up for the lack of CDR.","replies":[{"poster":"Wuks","date":"2017-08-10T02:23:55.977+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"# What are Heimerdinger's easiest matchups? What are his toughest?\n\n\nEnemies who can destroy your turrets easily, push you in or out-sustain your harass are the hard lane match-ups. Then comes the champions who can out-range your turrets/stun combo, and lastly champs who can dash/flash the stun combo.\nHARD = Anivia, Vlad, Ziggs, Swain, Jayce, Yasuo, Sion, Gnar\nEASY = Leblanc, Cassio, Zed, Ekko, Camille, Illaoi, Darius (need stormraiders), Gragas, Shen.

What about teamfights?\n\nYour job in lane is to gently apply pressure with your donger. Most solo matchups canâ€™t deal with your push/harass. Fish for stuns when the enemy goes for creeps /overextends near your turrets. Play SAFE when your stun is down. Force the enemy to use their TP, sums/potions/get creeps under tower so you can draw jungle aggro, help your jungler invade and get an advantage - take objectives. Help your mid/bot take their respective tower. Itâ€™s important to not get too greedy, (for example) pushing up too far without turrets/stun up. If you die and fall behind, you will likely lose the groove of the lane for the rest of the game.\nIn teamfights, you should stay far enough away to avoid most threat from the enemy but close enough to hit a max range W on the front line or squishies if the front line isn't doing their job correctly (which is 90% of the time O u O). Keep your turrets in hidden and safe places over walls, in bushes, etc so when you catch someone out with Ult+E they will shoot lasers and you can retreat to them. ULT+ turret is good for early teamfights but falls off in base damage (compared to other ults) and is easily killed late game.","replies":[{"poster":"Wuks","date":"2017-08-10T02:24:43.165+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"# If someone is playing Heimerdinger for the first time, what is the most important thing to bear in mind?\n\n\nYour turrets are your everything. They are your friend, your lover, your livelihood. Try to have some turrets stored up when you push turrets, invade/gank/dive enemy, take objectives. They tank for you, block skillshots, provide ward-like vision in bushes and over walls. Turret protec, but turret also attac. Turrets the majority of your damage when combined with your other abilities. Remember to place your turrets down FIRST before you throw your grenade / W ability (cuz they shoot a laser if you hit the E or full W). Basic combo is auto attack (for fresh blood proc) -> Turret -> Throw E -> Turret (WHILE E is in the air) ->Turret -> W.  By the time the E lands, there will be 2 turrets on the ground so 2 lasers will shoot the enemy. Then when your W lands there will be 3 turrets so 3 additional lasers will fire. Most enemies canâ€™t survive this combo when done properly.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Wuks","date":"2017-08-10T02:12:45.647+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"# Introduction","replies":[]}]}
