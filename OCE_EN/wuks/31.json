If you sign up before January 23, you&rsquo;ll also snag a 4-Win IP Boost to be distributed at the start of the event.\n\nIf you want your points to count towards the Ocean Week event, be sure to enlist on the Ocean Week website! You can still enlist after the 23rd, but you won&#039;t receive the sweet 4-Win IP Boost. I&#039;m about to head to sleep, but I&#039;ll see you guys on the flip side. Let's defend Melbourne!\n\nhttp://stream1.gifsoup.com/view8/20140105/4945031/for-narnia-and-for-aslan-o.gif","replies":[]}
