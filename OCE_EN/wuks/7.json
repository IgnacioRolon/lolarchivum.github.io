I have, after all, butted heads with Riot quite hard on certain things, which did include some quite toxic comments coming from me. That, however, is in the past (I've not gotten over what happened, I've just decided that there's no point continuing to argue those points when all it will do is make me *that* frustrated) and I'm now more focused on trying to help the people who come to the boards seeking it.\n\nBeing part of the volunteer program doesn't mean you don't voice you opinion when it conflicts with Riot. If anything, it's a very good reason to do so. Volunteers aren't just around to help people when needed, we're representatives of the community and, as such, it can be said that it is a responsibility of us to speak up when we disagree with one of Riot's decisions (though, not in a toxic manner).","replies":[{"poster":"Fitzky","date":"2017-06-15T05:57:24.067+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":3,"body":"That's funny when Sesshomaru is the only volunteer I have seen who has ever conflicted with Riot (after getting the role) and has argued against Riot on the boards. The rest of you suck up to Riot like the majority of players are sucking up for honours because all they care about is the rewards and don't give two shits about how everyone else feels. You can see why Sesshomaru is the only volunteer I've been positive to, because without him the scales wouldn't be balanced, the boards would be filled with goody-two-shoes that say yes to everything Riot suggest and think everything in League is perfect. I'm not saying the boards needs assholes, the boards needs people who disagree with Riot and point out some of the ridiculous shit they come up with.","replies":[{"poster":"Project Xayah","date":"2017-06-15T08:23:44.701+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"As Seras pointed out, understanding the why and how of Riot's decisions (and, by extension, how in-game systems work) and being able to explain them objectively doesn't necessarily mean you agree with them. I can't speak for any of the other volunteers, but I try to avoid anything that I feel too strongly about (I mentioned the fact I butted heads with Riot a few times in the past, and it's those kinds of subjects I try to avoid).\n\nThat said, I honestly haven't seen that much recently that I've disagreed with. I can't say I keep up with every change (big or little), because that would be untrue, but from what I've seen about Riot's decision-making recently there's nothing that stands out to me as something I'd be opposed to. I have a very much \"love/hate relationship\" with Riot (and not to confuse the company with it's employees), so it's likely that I'll have a bit to say about any decisions I don't agree with, when I see them, that is.\n\nIf you want to see the times I *have* opposed Riot I can (try to) scrounge up the relevant threads/posts and you can see how I have been at times I've heavily opposed Riot. Keep in mind, though, I do try to be (significantly) less negative now (which is nothing to do with the volunteer program, that's just a decision I made the last time I \"returned\" to the boards).","replies":[]},{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2017-06-15T07:36:55.877+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"Just because I try to give context on decisions doesn't always mean I agree with said decisions. You're free to have whatever opinion you want of me, but I'd rather it be because of who am I not who you think I am. Just as I agree with you on somethings and disagree on others, the same goes for Riot. \n\nI like honour, I don't like punishment feedback. I think the system does pretty well with chat toxicity but could do better with the sneakier intent feeders. I try my best to respect and understand Riot's decision-making, I am after all a PB people and have to explain a lot of it, but that doesn't mean I agree with all of it or think they are perfect and can't do better.\n\nThat said, yes, I do generally agree with Riot's decisions, but sharing an opinion doesn't mean sucking up.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Lord Sesshomaru","date":"2017-06-15T05:26:01.082+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Well said!","replies":[{"poster":"Talon12","date":"2017-06-15T08:57:33.376+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":3,"body":"That ego.","replies":[{"poster":"Lord Sesshomaru","date":"2017-06-15T09:51:24.753+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"You lost me?\n\nI see what Fitzky is saying, and can see why you could come to that conclusion. \nBut I think HeartVine had a good response. \nOne that is more or less what I believe as well.","replies":[{"poster":"Talon12","date":"2017-06-16T10:27:52.260+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":3,"body":"he complemented you and it went right top your head","replies":[{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2017-06-17T03:00:53.537+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'm pretty sure he was questioning your comment not Fitzky's","replies":[{"poster":"Talon12","date":"2017-06-17T03:56:55.403+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"yes.
