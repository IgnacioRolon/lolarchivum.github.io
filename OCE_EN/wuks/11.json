Try these solutions!","subforum":"Help & Support (OCE)","up_votes":7,"down_votes":0,"body":"Pro-Tip: Bookmark This. \nUpdated 11.11.15\n\nIf none of these solutions worked for you, please don&#039;t hesitate to post your issue in the Help & Support Boards, either as a new thread or in the Patching Issues thread for the corresponding patch. \n___________\n> #Preface\n\nIn troubleshooting patching issues, a common theme comes up that most patching issues can be resolved by a relatively small amount of solutions. For the sake of saving both of us the time and effort, here is a relatively comprehensive list of actions to take before posting a thread or submitting a ticket to Riot Games Player Support: \n______________\n> #Patcher Stops at 33% and/or Gives Unspecified Error Message \n\nSometimes you just have to wait out the duration of the patch, as certain stages in the patching process don&#039;t download additional files as files are moved from one folder to another. However, if you&#039;re getting the Unspecified Error has occurred, you&#039;ll want to try navigating to\n> C:\\Riot Games\\League of Legends\\RADS\\solutions\\lol_game_client_sln\n\n and deleting the contents of the folder. Re-run the client. This&#039;ll force a repatch. \n\nIf that didn't work, try:\n\nNavigate to \n> C:\\Riot Games\\League of Legends\\RADS\\projects\\lol_game_client\\filearchive \n\nand delete the filearchive folder. Re-run the client to force a repatch. \n______________________\n> #Try the Support Articles (these are GOLD!) \n\nIf that doesn&#039;t work, try the solutions provided in the [Patching Issues Riot Games Support article](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/202969434-Patching-Issues). If _that _ doesn&#039;t work, give the [Troubleshooting Connection Issues](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues) article a try. \n_______________\n> #Whoa! None of that stuff worked!\n\nWelp. Let&#039;s try something else. Go to \n> C:\\Riot Games\\League of Legends\\RADS\\projects\\lol_patcher\\releases\\ {highest version number}\n\nand copy the \"S_OK\" file. \nNow go to \n> C:\\Riot Games\\League of Legends\\RADS\\projects\\lol_air_client\\releases\\ {highest version number}\n\nand paste the \"S_OK\" file. Now try to restart the patching process. \n__________________\n> # Didn&#039;t work. \n\nWe must go deeper! Let&#039;s try patching over on the European servers, and if that works, then we can change our servers back to the NA servers with the patched files! Please try to make these changes to the following files:\n\nIn the file: \n> C:\\Riot Games\\League of Legends\\RADS\\system\\launcher.cfg\n\nChange the line: \n>\"airConfigProject=lol_air_client_config_na\" to \"airConfigProject=lol_air_client_config_eu\"\n\nIn the file: \n> C:\\Riot Games\\League of Legends\\RADS\\system\\system.cfg\n\nChange the line: \n>\"REGION = NA\" to \"REGION = EU\"\n\n___________________\n># Nope. Nope nope nope nope. \n\n1. Ok. Time to start grasping at straws. Let&#039;s try patching while running a VPN. By running it through a VPN, it may bypass any network/connection issues that you may be encountering. I&#039;ll recommend HotspotShield for the purposes of this post. \nDownload: http://www.hotspotshield.com/\nOnce the VPN is enabled, try running the patching process. \n\n2. Try repairing your client. If you're not sure how to do this,[ check out this guide](http://www.wrenchmen.org/resources/knowledgebase/1?view=article). \n\n2. You might want to double check to see if any Windows Updates are available to download. these updates may include essential software/driver updates that your League of Legends needs to run.\n\n3. When all else fails, try re-installing. :p\n\n_________________\n># So, nothing above worked. \n\nOk, while most of the problems that we see may be resolved by one of the above solutions, there are just so many variables that may cause patching issues. Don&#039;t worry, that&#039;s what we&#039;re here for on the Help & Support Boards. Hop over there, create a new thread or reply in the Patching Issues pinned thread, and post as much information about the issue you&#039;re having as well as a patcher log. If you don&#039;t know how to attach a patcher log, just follow [this guide right here](http://www.wrenchmen.org/resources/knowledgebase/howto/16?view=article). \n\nBut for the lot of you, hopefully we have been able to or will soon be able to resolve your issue regarding patching to get you back on the Rift... or Abyss... or Crystal Scar (whatever floats your boat, right?). If you found this useful, be sure to comment, rate, subscribe xD\n\nThanks guys,\nWuks\n\n#Note: Be sure to check your hard drive disk space. the patch might not be able to go through if your computer doesn't have enough space to patch!
