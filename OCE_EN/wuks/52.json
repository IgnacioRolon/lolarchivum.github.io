While we may be able to recognize and appreciate a lot of League of Legends fan art or fan fiction, we often might not take the time to understand more about the artist and what goes into creating a piece. That's why we're rolling out **Creator's Corner**. Creator's Corner is a publication that will spotlight content creators within the community by getting to better understand them in a Question & Answer or narrative style post. \n\nWe know that there are an extraordinarily high number of talented folk who would be a great fit for this publication, so admittedly, it may take some time for us to discover some of these people. We trust that you know talent and passion when you see it, so if you'd like to nominate someone for this series, please send your nomination to <a href=\"mailto:wuks@boards.lol\">wuks@boards.lol</a>. We've been working hard on this project for the past month or so, and we're close to debuting our first publications. Keep your eyes peeled, and we hope you enjoy!\n\n","replies":[{"poster":"Wuks","date":"2017-07-31T13:39:44.053+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"#Feature Headers in Concepts & Creations\n\nBack in May of this year, we gathered [feedback and suggestions related to what users wanted to see from the Boards](https://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/community-moderation/4HHR0ibm-boards-feedback-and-what-weve-gathered). Although we asked for suggestions that wouldn't be projects that required development resources, that didn't stop a lot of you from continuing to provide that feedback. But we do see where you're coming from with this feedback and wholeheartedly support a majority of your suggestions, nonetheless. So as we explore more comprehensive solutions, we've decided to move forward with a few solutions a bit smaller in scope for the time being. \n\nOne of the projects we're moving forward with is hosting a custom header for Concepts & Creations that will serve to feature really cool artwork created by our community. As you may have noticed, our first rotation has gone live, and we'd like to extend our kudos to Hozure for the great work that he does. We'll regularly reach out to content creators for permission to add their artwork into the feature rotation; and if all goes well, these feature headers will be something that connects Boards users to various creators.

Since then, there have been 8 more Ask a Champion Main posts, with the last one a little over a year ago. But as you know, there are well over 130 champions; and behind each of these champions is a devoted base of players who \"one-trick\" these champions to the highest echelons of the ranked ladder. To show you more about what each of these champions are capable of and how the top players push the limits of their champions to climb the ladder, we're bringing this series back with some of the largest one-tricking names. I've had the pleasure of working with a number of streamers over the past three months, and we're just about ready to go live with our first Ask a Champion Main in over a year. \"One step closer to greater understanding!\"","replies":[{"poster":"Wuks","date":"2017-07-31T17:20:15.309+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"ok","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"DannyT","date":"2017-07-30T21:54:59.892+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"wew","replies":[]}]}
