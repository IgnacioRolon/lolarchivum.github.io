By understanding that there are different approaches to problems, and furthermore understanding what those approaches may be, hopefully you&#039;ll be able to choose the more positive of the approaches and create a more positive environment for both you and the players around you. If you encountering someone being toxic, try taking the higher ground. \n\n###### [**Reposted from NA**](http://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/player-behavior-moderation/oL1NVLAR-you-know-you-treat-people-right-you-can-only-hope-that-they-treat-you-right)","replies":[{"poster":"Blackavar","date":"2016-02-11T08:53:56.075+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"This is really cool, if only everyone acted like this on league the community would be much better.
