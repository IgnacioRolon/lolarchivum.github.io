Today, we're rolling out our version 4.1.0 batch of updates, which hits a lot of performance pain points and should result in a noticeable improvement in page rendering times. As this is a full re-write of the previous updates and potentially the first time that some of you are seeing these updates, I'll take some time to go over the most noticeable changes we've made thus far:\n\n_______________________\n\n> #Space Optimization & Clutter Cleanup\n\n* **Smaller Stickers** - Sticker sizes on the Boards have visually been reduced by roughly 30%. \n* **More Text Space!** - We've increased the amount of text space used within comments and posts, which means more horizontal space utilization, and less scrolling.\n* **No more tiny nested comments** - We've taken a look at the comments area and clipped a lot of the unnecessary padding on the right side, giving comments more space and making it easier to read long comment chains.\n\n> #Functionality\n\n* **\"In Response To\"** - When reading in Chronological View, you'll be able to easily see which comments are referencing another comment, who they're replying to, and what those comments are.\n* **No Front-page Voting** - Boards users will no longer be able to vote from the Boards front-page or a sub-board's front-page. In order to vote, users will instead have to enter the thread to vote.\n* **Selecting Stickers on Mobile** - You should now be able to easily post champions, items, and stickers right from your mobile device!\n\n> #Clarity\n\n* Moderators, Rioters, and other Boards user groups should now be more recognizable with some additional visual cues.\n* Threads which are voting locked will be easily identifiable with a blue lock, and threads which are comment posting locked (and possibly voting locked) will be easily identifiable with a brown lock.\n* **Voting Indicators** - A green or red line will appear next to threads that you either upvoted or downvoted, respectively.\n\n> #Design\n\n* Vote colors will scale between red and green depending on the total vote count.\n* We opted for a dark-blue theme that was both easy on the eyes, and separated itself from the base green-purple design of the original Boards. We'll take a look at theme selection in the future and will hopefully have something to show soon.\n________________\n\n> #Images\n\n|Images|More Images|\n|-\n|https://i.imgur.com/GxgCsQE.png|https://i.imgur.com/zPPyKDf.png|\n|https://i.imgur.com/mSouaXB.png|https://i.imgur.com/rRCoLGO.png|\n\n_________________\n\nWe appreciate your patience throughout this process, and we hope you're happy with the changes so far.

I do like the blue, though. However, there seems to be far too much of it to make it blend together nicely. \n\nThe background is blue-ish, the borders are blue, the textbox is blue, the text is a blue-ish grey, the post button is blue. Everything is blue.\n\nhttps://i.gyazo.com/0eb6595b94e77192c4c2d3c83fa06b84.png\n\nIf that blue thin line was white, I think it would work nicely, it would help in splitting up sections.\n\nThis could just be me as I have issues with blue in general.","replies":[{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2018-04-10T08:05:55.716+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"How blueist.\n\nSrs tho, thanks for the feedback :)","replies":[]},{"poster":"Wuks","date":"2018-04-12T04:42:13.837+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I can definitely look at separating some of the sections better with more contrasting colours. :) I'll get back to ya.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Project Xayah","date":"2018-04-10T08:35:54.761+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"> There is far too much blue.\n\n♫ I'm blue, daba dee daba die, daba dee daba die ♫\n\n######I'll let myself out now...","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Wuks","date":"2018-04-10T06:21:14.696+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"We're going to run some updates on the current theme, and then we're going to look into theme selection options moving forward.","replies":[{"poster":"Broken Scripts","date":"2018-04-10T07:22:48.641+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Wuks,realm=OCE,application-id=Ntey9fRZ,discussion-id=jghL67nT,comment-id=00020001,timestamp=2018-04-10T06:21:14.696+0000)\n>\n> We&#x27;re going to run some updates on the current theme, and then we&#x27;re going to look into theme selection options moving forward.\n\nTheme options would be nice.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Lord Sesshomaru","date":"2018-04-12T12:37:36.242+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Im usually a fan of the _'if it ain't broke, don't fix it'_ mentality, and the oid version wasn't broken. Most people don't like change, so its always a risk.\nBut in saying that, at the time I didn't see any problems with the old forums, and was opposed to the change the 'new' boards brought. But that turned out to be a positive one. \nSooooo ill keep an open mind with this one.\n\nAs a graphic designer, I tend to agree in part with Broken Scripts, there is a lot of blue, and it doesn't always help. And while blue is good _(hella better than red)_ there isn't enough contrast between the blue and the background banner _(the Jhin artworks of Garen/Sona etc_). I think the colour in that top banner needs to be more vivid in order to make enough contrast to justify this many shades of blue. _(like why is the post button blue now instead of brown? its just unnecessary, and makes it feel like its greyed out)._\n\nAlso a lot of the text _(and other artefacts)_ are now WAYYYY too close to the borders of their respective boxes.\n\nMost notable here:\n\nhttps://imgur.com/a/5hX4V\nThe words are too close to the sides of the box and make it look unprofessional and cluttered.\n\nhttps://imgur.com/a/1SL8H\nAgain here, there isn't enough room around all the artefacts in the box, you can see the images almost touching the borders of the allocated space. And why is there more room between the picture and the top of the border, than there is between the pic and the bottom? Not good. Not good at all.\n\nOn a positive note, it is very clean and modern, the old design for the boards, while functional, looked dated before it even went live.\n\n______________\n\n#**ALSO MAJOR PROBLEM!!!**\n\nThe stickers are too small to be as sarcastic as they need to be!!!!\nThere was nothing better than a giant pantheon thumbs up to show how much you disapproved.\nNow they are too small to convey much emotion at all, sarcastic or otherwise.","replies":[{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2018-04-12T14:15:08.231+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Blasphemy! Red is obviously the best colour >:( (Though admittedly red in themes on webpages tends to look very overdone, use in moderation and all that).\n\nThat said, while I wasn't too deep in the details of this change, I do believe that a significant reason for moving forward with the stuff was the same reason we got a client update for League itself. Namely it'll make it a lot easier to add other features (like theme selection and other customisation) in the future. It's also got the whole \"marking anew age of boards\" schtick going on.\n\nThe obvious advantage of course being that community feedback is a thing that can actually be considered and/or implemented, as opposed to just being something we had no power over.\n\nI agree on the post button especially though.\n\nThe background banner is designed to be interchangeable, or rather the image will change every few months or so. I believe the Jhin one is somewhat of a placeholder and there is a different image that's getting put in soon.\n\nOn the text and their boxes, I agree the universal rules could probably use a tweak, just not sure how would look best. Make it any smaller and it's not obvious enough, move \"rules\" down a line and you have a real short second line. Remove \"boards\" and people won't know what it is (probs will think it's game rules or something).\n\nAs for the thumbnails, I have no particular problem with them other than the symmetry. There's more space at the top than there is at the bottom and that kinda pisses me off. The amount of space there is doesn't particularly bother me. I think it's enough that there's separation and not so much that the images drown in space.\n\nMore feedback the better, keep it coming :)","replies":[]},{"poster":"Wuks","date":"2018-04-12T19:43:25.348+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> And while blue is good (hella better than red) there isn't enough contrast between the blue and the background banner (the Jhin artworks of Garen/Sona etc).

We hear you guys on this one.\n\n> Also a lot of the text (and other artefacts) are now WAYYYY too close to the borders of their respective boxes.\n\nThe current image is more of a placeholder while we work to roll out some introduction posts for each of the sub-boards. We'll keep this in mind when rolling out the upcoming sidebar images, though.\n\n> Again here, there isn't enough room around all the artefacts in the box, you can see the images almost touching the borders of the allocated space.

We can snip out the 4 pixels of padding on the top that isn't on the bottom. :)","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Roguestoney","date":"2018-04-12T00:58:57.642+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Another thing.
