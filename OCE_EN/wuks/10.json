They were catch-all boards; however, GD was created specifically to carry over a posting style from the original forums. \n\nHowever, as we work to clean up the Boards, this means consolidating sub-boards for the sake of clarity and to reduce redundancy. As you may have noticed, the GD sub-board browsing experience is a bit bugged, to say the least. The options we&#039;d like to put forward are as such: \n\n* Archive GD, and keep Miscellaneous as is, with both Chronological View and Discussion View\n* Archive GD, and archive Miscellaneous, creating a new General Discussion board that will encompass both (Chronological View only)\n* Archive GD, and rename Miscellaneous to General Discussion or GD, while either removing Discussion View, or keeping both viewing formats\n\nIf you&#039;re in favour of any of these options, or you have an idea of your own, please share your thoughts below!\n\nThank you! :3","replies":[{"poster":"DarkShade918","date":"2018-07-04T08:46:36.632+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"{{sticker:slayer-pantheon-thumbs}} \n\nHeartvine","replies":[]},{"poster":"Project Xayah","date":"2018-07-04T02:18:33.935+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"> Archive GD, and archive Miscellaneous, creating a new General Discussion board that will encompass both (Chronological View only)\n\n{{sticker:slayer-pantheon-rainbows}}","replies":[]},{"poster":"KÃ¼rama","date":"2018-07-05T18:57:00.666+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Option 1.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Roguestoney","date":"2018-07-04T01:16:56.533+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Number game is dead now.
