I was up to my third major item (IE, PD already completed). I bought a negatron cloak to try and survive burst and built it into a GA, but did I build this too early? Should I have gone for lifesteal and the Bloodthirster instead?\r\n\r\nThoughts?","replies":[{"poster":"BarryButcher","date":"2015-02-03T04:29:55.923+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I don't know about finishing a GA 3rd item. If you are dying to Ahri due to the charm a QSS 3rd isn't horrible. gives MR and is only 1250 instead of the 2800 you spend on GA.\n\nI've also seen on very rare occasions, some AD's go hexdrinker 3rd and BT 4th for heavy AP damage. Gives you 2 shields. But yeah, VERY rarely since it isn't ideal.","replies":[{"poster":"Tucker08","date":"2015-02-03T04:45:56.220+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thanks for your thoughts. I think it was more through her burst than her charm, and I probably would have failed to use QSS in time, but if my mechanics were good that would be a much better idea. Hexdrinker is an interesting idea, but yeah it's more suited for bruisers. Any other ideas?","replies":[{"poster":"Schakle","date":"2015-02-17T01:37:16.821+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Honestly, if you die instantly having extra damage items doesn't help you. That was a good call but I feel like Scimitar would have been better (That's just my opinion I have no idea which would do more for you)","replies":[]}]}]}]}
