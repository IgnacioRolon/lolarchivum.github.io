Kyshac hadn&#039;t felt curious in decades and decided to ignore his councils requests. His journey would be long and he would most likely never see targon again so he took only a talisman of (insert a god from the lore universe which has never been mentioned so im just calling him the oroborus god ), the churches robes and his bohhokl staff. blah blah blah stuff happens he ends up on runeterra he starts a shrine on mount targon to try to communicate with targon which attracts some locals which then some become disciples which some become {{item:3190}}  and the others become lunari due to the stories of {{champion:136}}  and the interpretation of the dragons might. he grows tired and leaves the mountain leaving his disciples, he travels around runeterra chasing whispers of gods and deities ;{{champion:268}} ,{{champion:58}} ,{{champion:16}} ,{{champion:101}} ,{{champion:26}} ,{{champion:75}} . this all takes place many many many years before the present. during this time he visits the blessed isles which he learns some how to talk to spirits and deities, he acquires his kit arsenal in the blessed isles which is the other 2/3 of the talisman which had been broken and separated to never reunite as they are extremely powerful.  blah blah blah other backstory kit explaination stuff\nhis is a melee champ that focus around using his staff which is empowered by the talisman pieces.    \n\npassive: THE GODS WILL  \n                in a range of 550 units Kyshac gains 5/10/15% extra AM &amp; MR as well as a 20/25/30% increase of q passive ratios for 1/3/5 enemies \n\nQ - ETERNAL ALIGNMENT     CD 60 SEC at all ranks\n      Kyshac praises the gods and intern receives a blessing  which remains until another god is praised changing the blessing. \n      (this works kind of like a {{champion:4}}  W as you rotate between blessings, at spawn you choose between  3 talisman shards. at level 6        you                \n      will choose between the leftover shards and at 12 you will receive the last shard. the shards are required to praise the different gods)\n\nGOD OF LABOUR - AM,MR,AD bonus.  scaling at 0.3/0.4/0.5/0.6/0.7 for AM &amp; MR and 0.1/0.2/0.3/0.4/0.5 for AD \n\nGOD OF MISCHIEF - the AA damage is applied in a rotation of physical and magic DMG, applying a slow for each magic DMG AA\n                                  the chance of the magic DMG AA is increased with rank in Q 0.01/0.03/0.05/0.07/0.1% chance of hitting. the magic DMG             scales at 0.6 of AD at all ranks.\n\nOROBORUS GOD -  Kyshac opens the gates of the afterlife, offering the life essence of another in exchange for a small recovery of stats.
