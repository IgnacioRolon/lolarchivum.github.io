After many patches we are now in 7.5 and this couldn&#039;t be more standard; a classic tank/bruiser top, a tank/assassin jg, a control mage or assassin mid , long ranged spellcasting adc and a hard cc supp. so how does the meta shift in such a stable  situation? well as the joke has been all year &#039; ADC IN 2017 LUL &#039; how do we shift adc&#039;s into a better position in the game without constantly buffing the hell out of irrelevant carries? by switching their lane of course!\r\n\r\nI propose that the meta shifts into a scenario where we have a traditional tank top and mage mid, but instead of a single jungler we move adc and supp into jungle and jg into bot lane. in this scenario we have a supp help the traditional adc like {{champion:51}} {{champion:119}} {{champion:22}} {{champion:81}} {{champion:236}} {{champion:96}} . the supp is chosen on the ability that the ad can clear camps by himself  and the team comp.\r\nthis is implemented into a real team scenario :  you have a {{champion:54}}  top who is versing a traditional counter like {{champion:92}}   \r\nhe is having a really rough time as he is 0/2/0 20cs at 6 min in a traditional team the jungle would have to choose between helping him and the rest of the team but in this changed meta we can just send the supp such as {{champion:432}} {{champion:53}} {{champion:1}} {{champion:12}} {{champion:201}}  to help malphite in lane without disadvantaging the rest of the team,(surely this second champion in top lane will soak a percentage of the exp but malph will be able to farm and have his lane held while he backs so that he doesn&#039;t burn tp catching a wave) and while the supp is top lane the adc can gank various ways in the other lanes such as{{champion:67}} ulting and condemning the enemy by surprise or {{champion:22}} pinning down a target for another lane to kill. almost all adc&#039;s have the potential to help out other lanes in some way.\r\n\r\np.s. the adc takes all the jungle creeps and the supp helps with sustain, tanks creeps or speeds up clear times.\r\n\r\nthe 2 flaws in this meta are that the jg dosen&#039;t given enough exp for two people so either the supp item or jungle camps must give more exp and that if only one team deploys this strat then the bot lane with a single player will be subject to rape in kill lanes, but on the other hand the jg supp can just go back bot and match the regular supp.\r\n\r\nBTW: the whole point of putting the adc in the jungle is that he farms low risk and can focus on building damage early for snowballing games.\r\n\r\nleave thoughts in comments.","replies":[{"poster":"TheDemonEmperor","date":"2017-03-13T08:46:54.101+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":".....ADC+SUp in the jgl? how can they make a living with such limited gold income.
