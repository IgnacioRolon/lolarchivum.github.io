People in the following games will also report them (unless they cbf, don't know how, or have the mindset of \"riot aren't doing anything so i wont bother reporting them and just come to complain on the boards\"), and the reports will stack quickly. \n\n**You gotta report them if you want something done**","replies":[{"poster":"VmixD","date":"2016-02-21T01:41:42.040+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I do, each and every time.

I seem to recall it being said that the system recognises if someone is reporting excessively and it somehow lessens the effectiveness of their reports.  So if someone reports 10 bots in 3 games does this impact their ability to effectively report someone in their next ranked or normal game?  Or take it further, 60 bots reported in one week, does that make a difference?  Because I just made 4 reports in one 20min game. I'd like to know.","replies":[{"poster":"Maraudaur","date":"2016-02-26T21:32:40.999+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You can read more about our Player Behaviour systems here - http://boards.oce.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/player-behaviour/Y9YJ60Fn-player-behaviour-faq\n\n> What about false reports?\n> \n> When analysing reports, our systems look for behaviour patterns. Only consistent reports from reliable players will be enough to trigger a punishment.

Clearly reporting them is a reactive measure, and its not stopping these botting people from ruining a large portion of games for the actual people trying to learn how to play the game.  Even if everyone single person reported a bot, of which there must be hundreds, it would still be 2 or 3 games before anything would actually happen, maybe even more.  Can you honestly say that you think that is acceptable?\n\nI think its time you put your thinking hat on and came up with a method that actually hinders these people from continuing this special brand of cheating.  I'm sure its nice having your queue numbers padded with all the extra games, and I know it only effects pre level 30 players for the most part but its getting really frustrating.","replies":[]},{"poster":"SRPR","date":"2016-02-24T02:35:49.885+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"And... it appears again with other accounts.\n[](https://imageshack.com/i/pot2ySrtp)\n\nMaybe Riot should just ban that IP address altogether?","replies":[]},{"poster":"Hypnotits","date":"2016-02-21T20:19:26.759+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Had them aswell in intermediate\nThey don't communicate, goes to your lane, goes to everyones lanes then feeds, ks you etc\nGood thing I was using yasuo(I died 7 times tho lol)","replies":[]},{"poster":"VmixD","date":"2016-02-21T00:34:11.714+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I am with you here.
