Riot has stated many times people who report a lot for no reason, the reports won't mean anything. So you are actually being reported for a good reason. So this whole post was you whining to Riot because people keep reporting you for your bad behavior.","replies":[{"poster":"BOBBERT","date":"2015-01-31T06:32:30.958+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"See there you go again, offering nothing and picking on me voicing my opinion.\n\n\"the reports won't mean anything\" --- way to completely quote out of context...\nWe are talking about reforming people who have previously marked.

Quoting from the post you supposedly read:\n\n \"In future roll-outs itâ€™ll be possible for players to earn the next surprise so long as they've been positive since the last surprise was awarded. So, if you were chat restricted and missed a surprise, you could still be eligible if you were positive in the time range between that one and the next.\"\n\nSounds like bad players have to follow all the rules us good players already do naturally. If that's too hard, then that's your loss.","replies":[{"poster":"BOBBERT","date":"2015-01-31T06:46:52.293+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Thank you for making my first experience on the forums horrible.\n\nThey DO have a different set of rules, once you have been \"marked\" by the system following penalties require less incidents and offer harsher restrictions.\n\nCan someone other than this guy offer a response as he just seems to have an axe to grind.\n","replies":[{"poster":"SkarSkarSkarner","date":"2015-01-31T06:51:22.618+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=BOBBERT,realm=OCE,application-id=Ntey9fRZ,discussion-id=Fpe1hEOk,comment-id=0000000000000000000000000000000000000000,timestamp=2015-01-31T06:46:52.293+0000)\n>\n> Thank you for making my first experience on the forums horrible.\n\nNo need to thank me, you made the post and brought your toxicity along with you.","replies":[{"poster":"BOBBERT","date":"2015-01-31T07:03:41.405+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"My toxicity...","replies":[{"poster":"SkarSkarSkarner","date":"2015-01-31T07:06:15.906+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=BOBBERT,realm=OCE,application-id=Ntey9fRZ,discussion-id=Fpe1hEOk,comment-id=000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000,timestamp=2015-01-31T07:03:41.405+0000)\n>\n> My toxicity...\n\nYes, I answered your post and you disregarded it.
