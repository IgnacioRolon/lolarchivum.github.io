Why must you harden the pain even more by making lvl 30s being able to duo with lvls 10 into a lvl 20 game. The difference isnt even fair. Obviously the lvl 30 will definitely fkn dominate the game. it wont even be a team game anymore.","replies":[{"poster":"IMAFIRINMAHLAZER","date":"2016-06-18T05:09:09.196+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Level is not indicative of skill. I have plenty of friends that have played for years, know everything about the game and literally can't get out of Bronze V.\nAnd if it was indicative of skill, well you're getting some great practice and a good opportunity to improve on your skills","replies":[{"poster":"vSlyJam","date":"2016-06-18T05:45:08.405+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yes, its like that however. The problem with this is that, lvl 30s have access to full rune page, full mastery page. while the lvl 20s are what? only able to reach the one mastery keystone. thats the problem. Unable to fight back, obviously every lvl 30 will dominate.","replies":[{"poster":"IMAFIRINMAHLAZER","date":"2016-06-18T08:03:12.634+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I beat level 30s all the time on my smurfs. Sure I've been playing for longer but keystones/runes do not simply = guaranteed win\nPut it this way, if you learn to beat your opponents without the proper runes/masteries, imagine how easy it will be when you get them. \nThe reason you are getting matched with 30s is because Riot doesn't want the matchmaking time to be long for normals. The longer you have to wait the less likely you are to play. So with that in mind, I say you take this opportunity to improve your skills, really master things like csing and map awareness that will improve your playing once you hit 30.\n\nThe client is so buggy at times it doesn't switch runes and masteries over anyway. And I still win with the wrong build, vsing people at the same ELO as me. Think of it as a handicap for you to get better","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Á K Â L I","date":"2016-06-18T04:45:05.137+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"some level 30's are bad and play like a level 5","replies":[{"poster":"vSlyJam","date":"2016-06-18T05:46:38.558+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"i cannot find that to be true. unless they havnt had much experience ._.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Vanilla Bread","date":"2016-06-18T03:22:56.010+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"hmm never seen this topic before.","replies":[{"poster":"Omni Presents","date":"2016-06-18T05:32:34.818+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"This topic won't die down, not until Riot remove Dynamic Queue and fix the damn game.","replies":[]}]}]}
