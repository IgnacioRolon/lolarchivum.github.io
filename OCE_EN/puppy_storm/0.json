Upon reaching three stacks, her next basic attack or spell against an enemy champion causes an impure illusion of herself to appear that mimics her **Ethereal Coup&eacute;**'s and basic attacks. Illusions will attack and chase enemies, prioritising your target. Impure Illusions are uncontrollable and deal 20% of Ophelia&#039;s damage. Max 2 Impure Illusions. Impure Illusions cannot proc stacks of One Woman Army.\n\nOphelia&#039;s dual blades are infused with ethereal energy, and basic attacks deal an additional 11 - 125 bonus magic damage based on her level. \n\nDuring her ultimate, One Woman Army cannot summon impure clones, but keeps its stacks after the ultimate ends.\n_(Illusions have 3 points of health. IE: Noxious Traps, Rampant Growth)_ \n\n**Ethereal Coup&eacute; (Q)**\n0.75 sec Cooldown\n(12 second recharge)\n20/45/60/75/90 Mana \n[Range: 900] \n\nThrust one blade forward, sending out a peircing bolt of energy, damaging the first enemy hit for 60/100/140/200/220 (+0.7 AP) magic damage and slowing them by 20/30/40/50/60% for 1.5s. Other enemies hit take 50% damage. Any illusions present will also cast Ethereal Coup&eacute; toward the original bolt. \n\nEnemies affected by Feigned Charge are stunned instead of slowed for 1.75s. Max 2 Charges. \n_(Conceptually, First charge&#039;s animation uses her right blade, second charge uses her left.)_\n\n**Feigned Charge / Onslaught (W)**\n100 Mana\n24/22/20/18/16 sec Cooldown \n[Range: 650] \n\n**Feigned Charge**\nSend an impure illusion of yourself leaping forward to a targetted area, dealing 60 / 90 / 120 / 150 / 180 (+0.8 AP) magic damage and slowing enemies by 20% for 1.75 seconds. Reactivate within 1 second to blink and swap places with the illusion, snaring enemies within the area for 0.75/1/1.5/1.75/2 seconds. If you don&#039;t reactivate Feigned Charge, the cooldown is halved. \n\n**Onslaught**\nJump with your perfect illusions to a targetted area, each dealing (28/32/35%) of 60 / 90 / 120 / 150 / 180 (+0.8 AP) magic damage and snaring enemies within the area for 0.75/1/1.5/1.75/2 seconds. \n\n**Shatter / Shimmer (E) **\n80 Mana\n14/12/10/8/6 sec Cooldown\n[Range: 1000]\n\n**Shatter**\nShatter all impure illusions, causing 80/120/140/180/210 (+0.3 AP) magic damage in an area around them, and slowing nearby enemies by 40/45/50/55/60% for 2 seconds.\n\n**Shimmer**\n15 sec Cooldown\nBriefly turn all perfect illusions and Ophelia invisible and invulnerable for 0.75 seconds, randomly swapping places with each other, and giving Ophelia and her illusions a 20/30/35/40/50% burst of movement speed, decaying over 4 seconds.\n\n\n**Perfect Personas (R)**\n100 Mana\n120/100/80 sec Cooldown\n\nPassive: Ophelia's attack speed is increased by 10/20/30% for each impure illusion she currently controls. During Perfect Personas, Ophelia's attack speed is increased by 20/40/60%.\n\nActive: Ophelia shatters all current impure illusions, and summons three perfect illusions that are indistinguishable from herself in a formation around her for 15 seconds. Activating Perfect Personas again will cause one of the illusions to explode, dealing 60/120/210 (+0.8 AP) in an area around it. Perfect Personas can be re-activated up to 3 times. \n**Shatter (E)** is  replaced with **Shimmer (E)** and **Feigned Charge (W)** is replaced with **Onslaught (W)**. \n\nOphelia _and_ her illusions deal 28/32/35% (112 - 140% total) of the damage from Ophelia&#039;s basic attacks and spells. Illusions take 200% increased damage, however their health will appear to take the same damage as if they were Ophelia herself, but dying abruptly upon reaching their health threshold. Illusions killed by enemies will not explode. \n\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\n**Ophelia **is a mobile melee mage suitable for middle and top lane, with a possible niche position in the jungle. She uses a combination of refined swordplay with two blades and a deadly mastery of mental and ethereal  magic to empower her attacks while simultaneously confusing and stupefying her enemy into fighting a match where they appear overwhelmingly outnumbered. Ophelia&#039;s strengths lie in her ability to misdirect enemies into fighting her illusions, and her ability to dish out either consistent or burst damage. Situationally, Ophelia must choose whether to safely allow her illusions to attack and whittle down enemies with low damage, or to increase her risk by engaging in melee directly, which can reward or penalize her. Ophelia can also give up a larger portion of her mana in order to inflict somewhat safe damage through **Feigned Charge** and **Ethereal Coup&eacute;**. If Ophelia chooses to go on the offensive, she can be incredibly deadly, but at a large cost due to an increased cooldown on her escapes, as well as losing a sizable chunk of her already limited mana pool. During her ultimate, she gains a direct 12-40% damage increase to her passive, basic attacks, **Ethereal Coup&eacute;** and **Onslaught**, while also gaining a defensive advantage through **Shimmer**, making herself indistinguishable from her illusions and also, if skillfully deployed, can be used to evade incoming attacks.. During her ultimate, her impure illusions take a backseat and can't be summoned, and the main source of damage from the impure illusions is replaced with a secondary engage or escape, allowing her a brief window of either being able to use Feigned Charge and Shimmer to have an even greater chance at escaping her enemies, being able to safely move in and then out of a battle, or having incredible engage and chase. One of Ophelia&#039;s greatest weaknesses is Areas of Effect and bouncing damage, making her particularly powerful against single target enemies but at a distinct disadvantage against enemies with large amounts of Area of Effect damage. Due to the mechanics of her ultimate, it can be used defensively, but due its initially high cooldown, it should be avoided, lest you put yourself at a disadvantage to your enemy.\n\n**First ever champion concept, I would love some suggestions!**","replies":[{"poster":"LÃ©gs","date":"2015-08-18T12:21:40.842+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Could be a {{champion:7}}  rework xD\nNice though, sounds reaally fun !","replies":[{"poster":"Sethane","date":"2015-08-21T05:44:13.986+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I agree this sounds like an aweswome Lb rework.
