As an example staple build, I’ll use Black Cleaver & Last Whisper and compare them to Void Staff and Abyssal Scepter.\n\nThe total Magic Pen you gain from a Void Staff and Abyssal Scepter together is 20 Flat Magic Penetration and 35% Magic Penetration for a total cost of 4735 gold.\n\nThe total Armor Pen you gain from a Last Whisper and Black Cleaver is 10 flat Armor Pen and 35% Armor Pen  (+25% after 5 hits) and 90 AD for a total 5300 gold.\n\nWith two players using these two very commonly used penetration item sets together, The AD champion has a whopping 25% more Armor Pen than an AP champion, with only 10 less Flat Armor Pen for the increased cost of only 565 gold.\n\nThis is not taking in to account other amor and magic penetration items, but as far as it goes, The AP has two other possible additions; Sorcerer's shoes for another 15 flat Magic Pen, and a Haunting Guise for a further 15 Magic Pen. AD Champions have the options of the Brutalizer for a further 10 Armor pen, The Youmuu's for a further 20 Armor Pen, and the Warrior enchantment for a further 10 Armor Pen. Comparitively, if hypothetically an AD and AP champion were to make a build out of Armor and Magic Pen items, the AD character has a far wider variety of other stats such as more AD, cooldown reduction, health, critical chance, and an item active from Youmuu’s, where the AP champion gains far smaller amounts of AP and health from a haunting guise or Liandry’s Torment. \n\n\n**The comparison between Life Steal and Spell Vamp**\n\nLife Steal is extremely cheap to buy. Starting with Doran's Blade on 3% Lifesteal, and Doran's Ring with no Spell Vamp.\nThe first item available is Vampiric Scepter, giving 12% life steal for 800 gold. Life Steal will trigger on all Auto Attacks and a number of champion spells.\nHextech Revolver gives 12% spell vamp for 1200 gold.\nThis heals you on each single target spell hit, with reduced spell vamp on spells that affect more than one target. \nComparatively, the AD character is spending two thirds of the price of an AP character to heal for 12% of the damage of their auto attacks and some abilities, and this includes auto attacks that can hit in an AoE.\nThe AP character is spending a third more of the price of an AD character to heal for 12% of the damage of their single target spells, and 3.96% of their multi-target spells. The maximum spell vamp you can get is 52% and it is restricted to every time you cast a spell, and it has to be single target and it has to hit, and building this amount of spell vamp is unreasonably restrictive, putting the AP character at a significant sacrifice of their ability power to an AD character who could (easily) build up to 52% lifesteal.\n\n\n**Critical Strike**\n\nAP Characters cannot critically strike on any of their spells which innately have cooldowns attached to them. The only exception to AP characters being able to critically strike on spells is Nidalee’s Takedown and Viktor’s Discharge. However please note that Nidalee’s Takedown is critical strike is scaled from AD, but is delivered as magic damage, and is an auto attack. Viktor’s Discharge is also triggered on Auto Attack. AD Characters can critically strike on their auto attacks, and a selection of AD spells. Listed below are all spells that can critically strike. \n\nBlitzcrank's Power Fist, Darius' Crippling Strike, Draven's Spinning Axe, Garen's Decisive Strike, Jinx's Switcheroo, Nautilus' Staggering Blow, Nidalee's Takedown, Nocturne's Umbra Blades, Poppy's Devastating Blow, Quinn's Harrier, Renekton's Ruthless Predator, Rengar's Savagery, Riven's Runic Blade, Skarner's Crystallizing Sting, Shyvana's Twin Bite, Talon's Noxian Diplomacy, Trundle's Chomp, Vayne's Tumble, Viktor's Discharge, Volibear's Rolling Thunder, Wukong's Crushing Blow, Xin Zhao's Three Talon Strike, Caitlyn's Headshot, Gangplank's Parrrley, Garen's Judgement, Jayce's Hyper Charge, Lucian's Lightslinger, Master Yi's Double Strike, Master Yi's Alpha Strike, Nasus' Siphoning Strike, Yasuo's Steel Tempest, Shaco's Backstab, Talon's Mercy and Tryndamere's Spinning Slash.\n\nSoraka's Starcall counts as a critical strike if it hits in the center but is not affected by critical strike chance.\n\n\nThanks for reading my rant.","replies":[{"poster":"Chalze","date":"2015-03-20T08:23:02.529+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Why AP Characters are Better than AP Characters\n\n","replies":[]},{"poster":"Urgot Bot","date":"2015-03-19T13:13:03.629+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I didn't read all of that, but I think you missed one key point: AP characters generally build a helluva lot more AP than AD characters build AD (which means a lot more bonus damage) which is why there isn't as many MR penetration items as there is armour penetration. Same goes for spell vamp items. If there were stronger penetration items for AP champs, anyone who scaled off of AP would be completely OP.\n\nAlso, Karthus's Q technically crits aswell.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Riso","date":"2015-03-19T07:36:35.113+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"That's why ap Charecters burst harder, most have more mobility, easier to get more ap than ad and against full ad comps people can just stack armour.\nPlus no one really cares","replies":[]}]}
