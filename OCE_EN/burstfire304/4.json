You're in the OCE region, not the Australia and New Zealand region.

My comment was more disagreeing with MoonLord. I don't think anyone should be expected to learn a language to play a video game (with the exception of maybe pros) or even be expected to communicate in a particular language that may be difficult for them during their leisure time (though there isn't much reason to type at all if noone understands you).\n\nYou can't copy paste in game chat anyway, and I wouldn't recommend alt tabbing even when you're dead, it's a bad habit to get into in normals and is a detriment in ranked.
