Firstly KZ name is Kingzone Dragonx. \n\nOk so next some of the plays that you called shit or awful plays in the game really weren’t for example at about 26:30 when fnatic uses rift and backs off at the inhib tower you called that a dumb play. However what u didn’t seem to notice was that Bdd had tp. So if fnatic did stick around to try and take the inhib tower then there was a good chance that they could over commit and get collapsed on with the Sion tping in.\n\nWhat else during the landing phase you said that kz bot lane should have been able to just hard shove fnatic bot lane. The reason they couldn’t was one, rekkles had built a ton of attack speed so he could just clear waves and  two kz had 0 jg control in their bot side jg so it made pushing up really dangerous for them. \n\nWhat else you somewhere in here called fnatic top laner bwepo really bad which I’m going to have to disagree with. Since you need to remember that firstly he is a rookie, second he’s only played something like 10 official games on stage. And this is his first international event and he smashed khan. Some one who many people would call the best top laner currently in the game","replies":[{"poster":"BurstFire304","date":"2018-05-14T00:31:30.481+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"sion tp doesnt make them lose the fight. so nope. youre second point is wrong because i said they should shove when fnatic werent there. pay attention please. they knew where skarner was in both instances also. the fact hes a rookie doesnt make him better. he made mistakes and its the first ive seen of him so imo hes bad. i dont think he smashed khan i think the matchup was garbage. i appreciate you taking the time to give feedback but everything you have said in this post is either wrong or not relevant to what i actually said/think.","replies":[{"poster":"LAKIGR","date":"2018-05-14T05:37:52.495+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=BurstFire304,realm=OCE,application-id=hIjvqaz6,discussion-id=H0xsdOcE,comment-id=00000000,timestamp=2018-05-14T00:31:30.481+0000)\n>\n> sion tp doesnt make them lose the fight. so nope. youre second point is wrong because i said they should shove when fnatic werent there. pay attention please. they knew where skarner was in both instances also. the fact hes a rookie doesnt make him better. he made mistakes and its the first ive seen of him so imo hes bad. i dont think he smashed khan i think the matchup was garbage. i appreciate you taking the time to give feedback but everything you have said in this post is either wrong or not relevant to what i actually said/think.\n\nThe way you saying you want fnatic to play is really disrespectful, kingzone isn’t consided the strongest or one of the strongest team at msi for a reason. Where in pro games one fuck up can throw an entire game. 9/10 it is often way better to take the safer option and it’s better to take the slow and steady approach than to try and force any thing. Kingzone might have been behind but it’s not like the vlad and xayah were weak and under farmed. If caps or rekkles got caught by either zac/rakan it would be quite easy for xayah and vlad to blow them up and if that happens fnatic would have lost all damage allowing Kingzone back into the game. \nYour basing your judgments off what would work in solo q not what would work in pro games.","replies":[{"poster":"BurstFire304","date":"2018-05-14T23:15:14.364+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"the correct option is always the right one. they should have pushed bot inhib. fact. idc if they are nervous or whatever what they did was wrong. youre assuming my first idea is \"wow noob fnatic\" but its not my brain just works faster than most peoples. in that moment i went \"hey they should go bot\" then went \"they look like they are going to mid\" \"is going mid better? why?\" \"they should go bot\". that was my thought process (obviously a very simple version of it). im not disrespecting fnatic, im not saying they are a bad team, im saying that they played in a way that was bad in terms of macro vs what is expected by me. the level that i expect from a team like fnatic was not met in the match and as a result i expressed my feelings. these vod reviews arent scripted and i havnt seen the match so everything i say is spur of the moment. im sorry if you felt offended but fnatic is my favorite eu team. its nothing against them i just think they played poorly.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}
