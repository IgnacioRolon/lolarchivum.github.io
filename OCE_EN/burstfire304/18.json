Am gonna make a quick conjecture and say your \"coaching\" technique would be the same. \n\nIt takes more than an \"i think i can\" attitude to be a coach. In my humble views, you have demonstrated very little social experience, lack of depth to your thought process, and  a very low standard for the word coach. \n\nAt this point, it just looked like you want the prestige title of coach while lacking the capability.","replies":[{"poster":"BurstFire304","date":"2020-01-28T09:03:43.693+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"idk why you think that but i disagree. thanks for your opinion anyway tho :)","replies":[{"poster":"TheDemonEmperor","date":"2020-01-28T10:41:01.902+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"> idk why you think that but i disagree. thanks for your opinion anyway tho :)\n\nWhich do you disagree with, one? or all of them?. You are not expanding on your statement at all. You've pretty much left all the details out, why? \n\nIf you cant even communicate effectively in a basic disagreement, how the hell can you coach? I got a feeling you might be a high school student looking for an easy access to a title.","replies":[{"poster":"BurstFire304","date":"2020-01-28T22:22:55.477+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"ok :)","replies":[{"poster":"BeefyBill","date":"2020-01-29T00:26:27.548+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"all you need is this https://oce.op.gg/summoner/userName=BurstFire304\n\neverything makes sense","replies":[{"poster":"BurstFire304","date":"2020-01-29T01:50:00.779+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"no games played for 2 weeks. everything makes sense. i wonder what burstfire has been doing for 2 weeks. probably nothing. all the evidence is here boys","replies":[{"poster":"Dragonair","date":"2020-01-29T06:46:04.936+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Lets not forget about this gem!\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pn-wyY0PnRs","replies":[{"poster":"BurstFire304","date":"2020-01-29T09:00:47.546+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"and what does that video tell us ?","replies":[{"poster":"TheDemonEmperor","date":"2020-01-29T10:03:53.005+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> and what does that video tell us ?\n\nYour inability to articulate and form decent retorts would be one.
