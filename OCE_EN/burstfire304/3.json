(which i consider myself to be, maybe im wrong)","replies":[{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2018-02-08T07:39:47.836+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Honour isn't the fastest thing to level. It's taken me from the season reset to now to level up (and that's technically only 1 checkpoint not a whole level) so I think 1 month might be a bit ambitious. Keep playing positively and the honour will come with time. If you're being honoured, that's your game to game reward you know? You're team saying they respect you for one thing or another that game. Honour levels themselves are more of a long term goal.","replies":[{"poster":"BurstFire304","date":"2018-02-08T21:35:12.444+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"ok good points","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"shadowfeaux","date":"2018-03-31T07:11:18.846+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"damn. been playing since the reset and i barely got back to honor 3. been sitting at 3 for 2 months if not longer, not even one of the checkpoints. roommate plays at least as much as me and hes still stuck at the starting lvl 2 checkpoint 3. wish there was some kind of progress bar to see it move even a tiny bit.","replies":[]},{"poster":"JasonWazza","date":"2018-02-08T05:45:02.512+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":">ive been chat restricted before but that was like a month ago\n\nThere are people who got restricted like a year ago who are still honor 0, you have a long way to go.","replies":[{"poster":"Ingénue","date":"2018-02-08T12:27:45.399+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Most likely because they are still low-key flaming, but not consistently enough to net a proper punishment. \n\nThere are plenty of other players who got honor locked last season only to get it back up and going within a month.","replies":[{"poster":"JasonWazza","date":"2018-02-08T12:44:48.477+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I mean, i'm still sitting in the exact same spot right now, mostly due to the fact that i only play with friends (honor's mean less from premades.) and due to the fact that i just don't play often enough.\n\nAnd it would not surprise me if Riot made it harder to climb honor when they tied rewards to it.","replies":[{"poster":"Ingénue","date":"2018-02-08T12:49:28.922+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Honor is going to be going up comparatively slowly than it was last year, due to us having a full season to collect levels as opposed to a few months.","replies":[{"poster":"JasonWazza","date":"2018-02-08T13:24:53.820+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I mean.... even in the same timeframe i was actually Level 5 Honor within ~2-3 months of the honor release.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]}
