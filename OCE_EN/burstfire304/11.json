Initially thought it was due to a recent ticket submission through Support, which tend to cause \"log in\" issues if you don't handle the log in processes properly. Made sure I was logged out properly on both Boards and Support, still had the issue. I then decided to attempt clearing my browser history/cache, because I figured it was probably related to that, still no dice. Have ensured, on each attempted fix, to check the \"remember me\" box. Can't think of any reason it should be happening (or any potential fix on my end), but it is painfully annoying considering I check in on the boards several times a day.","replies":[{"poster":"BurstFire304","date":"2018-05-30T00:58:41.620+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"feelsbadman :(","replies":[]}]}]}
