Realistically if you have control over the map beyond river, you should probably have a control ward on baron anyway.","replies":[{"poster":"BurstFire304","date":"2018-04-23T00:47:14.104+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"i dont understand what you mean by blue trinket. janna ward and recall and run to baron is not as quick as rest of team reset and run baron and rest of team reset run to baron is too slow anyway. so no i think you have to do baron now or take inhib. we didnt have a control ward due to our mid and top lane priority and huge gold leads across the board. watch the video entirely i feel like i have addressed everything you are saying.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}
