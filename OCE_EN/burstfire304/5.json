It makes no sense to me that only a percentage were reset. Literally takes a year to go from 1 to 2. Most people I know who dropped are still at the same level they dropped to, despite getting 2+ honours each game.","replies":[{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2018-02-09T07:48:32.028+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Because people were only reset down.

So, the honour system is complete garbage and should be reset for everyone.","replies":[{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2018-02-09T09:24:32.705+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"Now that's a log I'd like to see lol.","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Barry","date":"2018-02-13T07:33:33.049+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Nice my dude","replies":[]}]}]}
