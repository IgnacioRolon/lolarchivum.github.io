In game no issues, just the loading of the end game results, starting queues, responding to the \"game found\" screen, even messaging. It's all laggy.\nHopefully the next patch will fix this!","replies":[{"poster":"Aesseus","date":"2020-01-09T00:25:20.752+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Happening to me also, I see people in games, but my client is saying queues are unavailable, I get a black screen logging into the client for minutes I reload client sometimes it works sometimes it doesn't. I get these weird characters for users in chat that aren't their usernames.\nMy league client is totally capoot.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"VXer","date":"2020-01-06T12:02:03.244+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I experience it within the Loot menu, takes forever to select champion/skin shards for re-rolls. Run into the same issue while trying to swap champions in ARAM, pick player icons, select runes, etc. \n\nThere's a distinct delay in launch time into pre-game and post-game menus, where the game has loaded to those menus but are unresponsive/frozen in that initial greyed out launch screen.\n\nSimilar checks done on CPU/RAM, DirectX and graphic driver updates - nothing seems to correct the issue. Much like everyone else, the actual League of Legends Game Client runs without any problems outside the norm, seems to just be LeagueClientUx &amp; LeagueClientUxRender","replies":[]}]}
