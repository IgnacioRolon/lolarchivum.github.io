You're prompted more than once before you purchase a skin, there's no easy way to accidentally purchase content.\n\nYou could [use one of your refund tokens](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201751864-Content-Refund-FAQ#h2q1) to refund the purchase if you have any left, otherwise you're out of luck.\n\nFor more information on refunds, see the [Content Refund FAQ](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201751864-Content-Refund-FAQ).\n\n>**I ACCIDENTALLY PURCHASED SOMETHING! CAN I HAVE A FREE REFUND?**\nWe will not provide free refunds for accidental purchases under any circumstances. The only way for you to refund an accidentally purchased item is by using your refund token. When making a purchase, please double check to make sure you are buying your desired item. The store will prompt you to confirm before completing the purchase.\n\n>https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201751864-Content-Refund-FAQ#h2q4","replies":[]},{"poster":"Deep Terror Nami","date":"2016-02-18T11:58:14.715+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey DragonPower17,\n\nUnfortunately Riot has a strict policy of not giving refunds for \"accidental\" purchases; people can too easily lie about a purchase they simply regretted getting, and Riot would have to refund everyone if they refunded anyway. You have to rely on your limited Refund Tokens. Read more about their policy here; https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201751864-Content-Refund-FAQ#h2q4\n\nHowever, you can still make the request through a [Support Ticket](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/requests/new). Don't get your hopes up too high due to the policy, though.\n\n-DTN","replies":[]}]}
