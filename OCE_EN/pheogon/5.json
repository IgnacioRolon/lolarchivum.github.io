I don't like this if someone could review my dkill level amount of lls and deaths assist and method of play im a good player its not fair for me to be put int this elo with wreckers. also the game before I was nasus and had a tristana that didnt know how to build and hecarim who couldnt build items either for the character they are playing the skills they dont know how to use these characters and they are playing ranked it annoys me. I want a review of my elo or atleast a fair chance of rising through the ranks playing with other people who want to do the same not troll but get out of bronze.","replies":[{"poster":"HORSE OF FORCE","date":"2015-03-15T10:41:30.867+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":">fizz top\n\nThat's meta man. Like, why do you think that's troll?\n\n>nidalee that doest land a single spear\n\nThose things are thin.\n\n>jinx who doesnt know the mechanics behind jinx.\n\nAre you saying that everyone should know everything about the game at all times?\n\nYour personal kills and deaths don't really contribute to whether your team will win or lose. They only contribute to how much influence you'll have in the later, crucial fights and objective control. If you really believe that you're a division above what you should be, then play assassin champions like LeBlanc or Zed, and constantly assassinate the crucial enemy carries; that should help your team win every team fight.\n\nThere is no such thing as being able to blame your team-mates for you not being able to climb the ladder. You are matched with nine other people around your skill level, and then are sorted into fair teams. If you're better, then your slight skill advantage will be enough to tilt the majority of games to victory and not defeat, because of the randomness of it all.\n\ntl;dr Just keep trying.","replies":[{"poster":"Pheogon","date":"2015-03-19T05:37:38.069+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"most of the teams I've played with are all unfairly matched with teams winning in great amounts of gold and objectives so Its not really fair to mentin I just had an afk draven in my last match before this post.","replies":[{"poster":"HORSE OF FORCE","date":"2015-03-19T09:05:36.939+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Oh, yeah, sure.
