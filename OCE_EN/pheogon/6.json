I regularly go 6/1/30 with Blitzcrank, so you're not Gold tier buddy.\n\nSecondly, this is assuming you're not trolling and are being legitimate with your complaints, then I can tell you that _you_ are the reason your team lost and that you are in bronze. And you will be the reason you will stay in bronze. Look at the chatlog in the post game screen. If that's anything to go by, you probably flamed the majority of the game. I have been in teams where I've been flamed, and I have flamed at others (in fact, I'm serving out a 2 week ban that I deserved for flaming, so I know more than most). It never helps. You'll hardly see high ranking players flame at others.\n\nYou lose as a team and you win as a team. Just because you have 26 kills or 5 billion goldâ€¦ it doesn't mean anything unless you carry the rest of your team, both physically and spiritually. There's a difference between having 26 kills and losing beceause you flamed at everyone else, calling them noobs in All chat, and not helping out because it was a lost cause, and someone having 26 kills and carrying their team with encouragement and ganks and support, without flaming.\n\nUntil you learn that, and stop fisting the air, cursing the gods for putting you in bronze, you will forever remain there. I'll never flame again after this ban, and I'd like to think I'll win more games because of it.","replies":[]}]}
