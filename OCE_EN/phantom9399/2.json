Not feeding most of the time unless its a legit shit machup. \r\n\r\nThe amount of people raging (both sides) at my troll picks and how I am normally either doing ok or really well with them is amusing. I have been told to kill myself a few times by the enemy players due to how badly they lost their lane to my troll pick.\r\n\r\nClimbed from b5-b3 with mostly troll picks. Got a few people punished due to being abusive to me (both team and enemy) and get to troll without getting punished by doing troll picks (ashe mid, blitz top, karthus sup, ect).

Have not been salty but I did refuse to help my salty team when they flamed me for my troll builds so I just farmed all game until we lost.

I legit trolled so hard in my last few games you could technically call it feeding. I forced easy wins into 40 minute plus games by just farming jg. How the fuck did I even make level 2?

He even told me to kill myself at one point. Just sat in jungle farming, racing Cho to 10k hp while ekko fed and flamed and blamed me for the loss. Note i had most kills for most of the game until it was pre much 3 inhib down where its gg and the enemy was just toying with us. Hope this salty kid enjoys his 14 day ban.

I get spammed with even more fucking keys. I have not been a \"honorable\" player several games. Hell I even had a go at a useless Pyke who thought he carried bot lane (bitch please you did nothing but KS and miss your ult every time you used it). \n\nYet I make it to honor level 1 checkpoint 1. Good job with the stupid honor system. Once again look at my builds, picks, cs, games. All troll and memes, nothing serious unless I duo with some one. \n\nLoving honor so much right now, I love getting spammed with keys every time I log in...

Every time I log in I get a message \"you received 650% more \"insert honor name\" honors then the average player, here is a hextech key\". Riot please I don't want your keys and I am not trying to get honors, I am trying to meme so stop mememing me and spamming me with these damn keys xD\n\nSide note, asked for that shit to be turned off and apparently they can't, the only way I can get rid of it is loosing my honor. To loose my honor I need to flame, which will result in a perma ban so nope. Leave intentionally and get leaver buster, but cbf waiting 30 minutes for a game at the moment, might do this later though. Or just feed but that might result in a perma as well so not keen on that.\n\nCould just afk in base as well and watch my team flame me in chat, could get a few bans thrown in for them being toxic to me. Might be fun to do that, get leaver buster and get people banned. Sounds like a win-win to me.","replies":[]}]}
