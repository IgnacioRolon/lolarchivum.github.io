It&#039;s only a 14 day ban (miss out on the quests but eh, my own fault for being toxic).\r\n\r\nI am looking for advice on how to avoid this again. Recently I have been having games where I do really well but some members of my team feeds and then I get tilted because I am unable to carry the game and we loose because of this. Yes I will admit now I did flame in several of these situations as I was just really annoyed. What do I do in these situations? As it is very frustrating, especially if I dominate the lane I was in. \r\n\r\nAnother issue I am having is people picking troll champs in ranked like Ziggs bot lane, its just super tilting when stuff like this happens. What do I do in this situation? Just dodge que and get a 20 min delay again? Pick a farm based champ and stay in my lane until the enemy wins? Serious question.","replies":[{"poster":"SOOM","date":"2017-10-19T20:28:41.150+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Ziggs bot lane is a thing though.... I think in your case the best pathway for you which helped with me is .... Imagine it is you feeding because you got outclassed by the enemy laner ... Now think how would you feel if your team flamed you for losing to him/her/other gender (cause 2017). It doesn't feel good. \n\nI hope you can get some insight from this because sometimes people get outclassed and that is that you can't do anything about that especially in silver and people mostly dont know how to play from behind .. (Including you). \n\nSo yeah that is basically it put yourself in their shoes they might have tried their hardest but just merely got outskilled. You wouldn't like to be flamed by your 4 other teammates when get destroyed and it happens to all of us.\n\nFor the Trolls .... you are bronze MMR and silver 5 is basically bronze so you on troll highway. Ziggs isn't a troll pick btw. If you do encounter a troll in champ select yeah just dodge, but if you don't want to dodge and lose some LP for some weird reason, the most important thing to do is not flame him... DONT even talk to him just ignore him. I advise against muting to start with unless he/she/other gender gets beyond help but just don't talk to him is the most important thing because in most cases a troll will actually try unless he is provoked which could lead to him running down mid.\n\nCheers \nMysticLlamaZ{{champion:55}}","replies":[]},{"poster":"phantom9399","date":"2017-10-20T14:17:38.146+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thanks for the reply's guys.\n\nZiggs bot lane can be a thing but in our situation we needed a proper adc as we had no anti tank champions. Top lane is my worst role so I picked a \"comfort\" pick to avoid feeding (I did feed due to being tilted, but that was after mid and jg ganked me a couple of times and got Kled ahead). The player said ADC is not his good role and I offered to swap with him as I am better at ADC but he does not swap because it is not JG or Mid. Not trying to put the blame on him, just giving some understanding on the last game. I should not have flamed him and I should have just played my lane. Let bot lane do their own thing and I do my thing up top.\n\nI understand people get outclassed, I get outclassed all the time in bot lane (vayne op ;) xD) however I try and play safe if I am loosing the match-up. What frustrates me is when they dont play safe and keep feeding. While they become worth gold they are still giving the enemy mid heaps of exp, roam potential, cs and even tower damage. E.g. if the are 0-3, 50 cs by 10 minutes that is not to bad as they played safe and can come back. But if they are 0-6 and 30 cs or less that is when I get frustrated.\n\nI am not a fan of dodging as I was under that 20 min wait for 10 games at one point due to shotty internet (fixed now and I think im off it now). If I am in a game with a \"troll\" pick I will just play my best and mute them (and hope I am not an adc with a troll support).\n\nWhile I do get frustrated it is no excuse for me to flame, as it not only tilts me but it also tilts the team. I just need to work out a way to get rid of that frustration. But I can't just go afk for 5 min to get a drink or something like that as I can get reported for AFK.\n\nNormally gaming helps me with my negative behaviors but I think I need to stop playing ranked when i am in those moods and just stick to norms, pick a champion I am good at, win a couple of games, then go to ranked later. \n\nI am using this 2 week ban as a break from LoL so that I can prepare myself for pre-season. No more flaming and just mute people when I am frustrated and try to end the game quickly by going for objectives and using my advantage to help the team.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Project Xayah","date":"2017-10-20T02:43:17.501+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"MysticLlamaZ makes a really good point. When considering how to stop yourself from being toxic towards others, it can really help to put yourself \"in the shoes\" of others and consider how they might feel when you flame them. The important thing here is \"empathy\", which (for those who might not know or be sure) refers to the ability to understand and comprehend how another person might feel in a given situation. If you can objectively look at a scenario where one person is flaming and can understand how the person/people on the receiving end of that behaviour would be feeling, you're on your way to improving your own behaviour.\n\nI'd like to take a moment to talk about \"troll picks\" here. One thing I think it's important to consider here is that \"troll picks\" aren't always intended as \"troll picks\", you might find that there's an intention to win more often than you think. I'd like you to try something with this; anytime you see something you *think* is a \"troll pick\", ask the person why they're making that choice. Communicate with them, learn what their strategy is and find out if it's their intention to win, because you might actually be surprised by how often there *is* an intention to win.\n\nBeyond that, there are various activities that you can participate in that can act as an outlet for that kind of aggression and frustration. I'd suggest trying out some different activities to see what helps you manage your negative behaviours. You can try things like reading a good book, doing some physical exercise (particularly things like martial arts), using a creative outlet (such as writing, painting, drawing, sculpting etc). Experiment with it, find something that works for you. If you need to, take a break from LoL while you sort yourself out. It will be better in the long run if you take a break now to improve you behaviour rather than continuing to play and getting perma-banned because you snapped once, and I think it's safe to say you *will* snap at one point or another. Don't let that discourage you, it's a process that will take time.\n\nGood luck, I wish you all the best.\n{{sticker:slayer-pantheon-thumbs}}","replies":[]},{"poster":"Fitzky","date":"2017-10-20T03:22:39.551+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Literally just don't use the chat, that's it.","replies":[]}]}
