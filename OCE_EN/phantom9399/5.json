I have just gone from honor level 0 to honor level 2 in 6 months by trolling in nearly every game i&#039;ve played. By trolling I mean I have purposefully delayed ranked games so that instead of them being a 20 minute easy win, they are dragged into 40 min + games, to waste every one&#039;s time. I do this by farming jg and taking dragons + herald (without spawning it). Yet I have now reached honor level 2. What a joke.\r\n\r\nSince reaching level 1 I get spammed with these stupid key fragments every time I log in. Spoke to riot to disable it. &quot;Can&#039;t do that&quot;. Asked them to remove my honor completely and lock it. &quot;Can&#039;t do that&quot;. So the only way i can stop the shit is by getting reported. Can&#039;t flame as I am on a final warning (fair enough, i&#039;m toxic as fuck&quot; and I don&#039;t want to loose the skins. Can&#039;t afk as I need to do it in multiple games before I even get my honor dropped (this includes going from 5 min up to 20 min wait times). Can&#039;t cheat cause insta ban, fuck that, I am not that desperate. So the next best thing is troll ingame while still getting &quot;objectives (dragons)&quot;. Troll picks and builds as well. Yet for some stupid reason, here I am at level 2. Do they even check over the account after level 1? Have they even read my chat, I don&#039;t flame but I cause others to flame me and then report them so they get hit with punishments and I get fuck all.","replies":[]}
