This is after countless reports by other players as well.\n\nhttps://boards.oce.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/player-behaviour/cO7ApjMl-memes\n\nLook at my match history as well, constant troll picks in ranked, yes I go for objectives and play the game but at the same time im tilting my team into flaming me and reporting them, several have been banned due to your flawed reporting system.\n\nThis is actually getting stupid now, I know for a fact I have been reported many times but no action has been taken against me in regards to my meme's. I continue to get honor and somehow continue to climb in ranked.\n\nThe funny thing is I started doing this to get rid of honor level 1 since you guys \"cant remove honor\" without a punishment, I can't flame cause its a perma, CBF stacking up my wait times to get the honor locked that way, so I thought this would be the \"safest\" way to avoid a ban but still get a punishment to drop my honor. Instead I have just discovered the system is an absolute joke.\n\nI say one word and its an instant 14 day ban. I troll for 4 months, get a lot of reports sent in, yet I continue to gain honor.\n\nAlso, your honor system is a joke as well, I can request for my end of year reward banner shit to be removed from view on my profile but i cant get my honor locked. What is this shit? Now i get spammed with keys everytime I log in cause I am \"47% more of a good teammate then the rest of the oce community\". I meme in all my games and rarely get honors so that system surely is flawed as well.\n\n\nMAMA MEEP\nSeptember 12th 2018, 9:33:36 am\nHey there phantom9399,\n\nSorry for the long delay on our response. Due to a high volume of incoming requests it has taken us longer than normal to get back to you. ;-;\n\nSo going through your case here and trying to think where to start. Hmmm, I guess let's first tackle the idea that you get a ton of reports cause based on your account's history, you really don't get a reported a lot at all. :0 It's not really a number of reports that leads to people getting penalized either, but rather whether or not the reports the account is receiving are accurate at all. We don't wanna issue penalties to someone who just happens to be getting reported a ton, despite not doing anything wrong.\n\n\"Trolling\" is a tough behavior to break down not just for an automated system (which is what most of our penalties are issued by), but for the regular community too. We don't wanna prevent people from trying out new champs in new roles, or new item builds either. That's how the game naturally evolves, by testing, failing, and testing some more! We also don't wanna penalize players just for having a bad game every now and then (or a lot if that's what it takes for someone to learn and get better too).\n\nIt's really difficult to define intent as well. While you may be saying \"I don't intend to win\" in your games imagine this; what if someone played exactly as you did, same champ, build, non-afk but non-interactive playstyle, but they didn't outright claim that they weren't trying to win like you do, then how does an automated system tell the difference between someone with the intent to troll and someone with the intent to win? It can't sadly, and neither can we as humans. This does NOT invalidate the automated banning of verbal abuse cause like, what people say in chat is pretty clear. :/\n\nAnyways, based on what we've heard from your own peers via the systems and our tickets, we're not going to be actioning your account for the meantime. Know this can always change depending on what we find though.\n\nLet me know if you got any other concerns,\n\nMama Meep\nSupporter of Players\n❄️ Meep Collector ❄️\npengu\n\n\nPHANTOM9399\nSeptember 19th 2018, 9:27:05 am\nSorry for the delayed response, this was in my junk email for some reason.\n\nSo pretty much I can force games into the late game, waste peoples time, go troll builds and champs, yet nothing will happen. The only other way I can loose my honor is going afk in games and getting a few leaver busters. As I can't flame, on my last warning for that since last year as stated above. Plus you guys won't just disable my honor.\n\nI guess the good thing is, I can continue to get others 14 day bans by making them rage at my troll builds.\n\nRegards, \nPhantom9399\n\n\nMAMA MEEP\nSeptember 20th 2018, 1:22:13 am\nHey again,\n\nAs I said before, difficult to define what troll builds and champs are. We aren't gonna limit people from trying out different things. You don't lose honor by going AFK, but doing so can lead to other penalties outside of leaverbuster, especially if we find you're doing so purposefully.\n\nAs for flaming and being on your last warning; while you did have a 2 week ban before, accounts de-escalate from that final warning over time and with games played. We aren't gonna hold accounts hostage like that especially if the player themselves has improved.\n\nIf you got other questions lemme know.\n\nMama Meep\nSupporter of Players\n❄️ Meep Collector ❄️\npengu\n\n\nPHANTOM9399\nSeptember 20th 2018, 9:32:59 pm\nSo pretty much the only way I can loose honor is by flaming and getting another 14 day ban. I can't do so by feeding, trolling, making games go for longer, causing others to flame, pretty much griefing the game and ruining the experience for others?\n\nThe last few ranked games I have played I have thrown just to try to loose this honor and make my team mates rage. You can see the proof in my games history and my rank (Dropped 2 ranks in 2 weeks when I was on a steady climb to silver)\n\nGood to know that I now have a way to get rid of this stupid honor level crap. All I need to do is flame 1 game, get a 9 man report, then this honor gets dropped and locked. Then hopefully you guys can keep it that way.\n\n\nMAMA MEEP\nSeptember 21st 2018, 1:13:45 am\nHey again,\n\nHonor reductions only come from receiving penalties from the Instant Feedback System. This includes stuff like intentional feeding and trolling, but again, not really any signs of you trolling on this account.\n\nIf you wish you purposefully get banned well..that's up to you but I don't really recommend it.\n\nLet me know if you got other questions, otherwise this ticket will be closed out shortly.\n\nMama Meep\nSupporter of Players\n❄️ Meep Collector ❄️\npengu\n\n\nPHANTOM9399\nSeptember 21st 2018, 10:10:45 am\nSeriously? I have been intentionally trolling for months. Just the other day I threw a game which I could have easily won by farming and killing dragon instead of pushing mid and ending. At this rate you might as well close this report because this is pointless, I have just admitted to trolling, yet I am not getting punished and my honor is still on level 2. Do I really need to tell people to report me in order to get rid of this honor level? Might even start banning my teams champs in champ select and stealing roles. Should hopefully speed up the process.\n\n\nMAMA MEEP\nSeptember 22nd 2018, 1:23:02 am\nHey again,\n\nAs you don't have any new concerns this ticket will now be closed out.\n\nMama Meep\nSupporter of Players\n❄️ Meep Collector ❄️","replies":[{"poster":"Gehirn","date":"2018-11-10T05:40:18.333+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Mama Meep's answers explain it all well enough.\nYea the kind of behaviour you're describing (like \"Just the other day I threw a game which I could have easily won by farming and killing dragon instead of pushing mid and ending\") could go unpunished for a long time or perhaps indefinitely for all the reasons Mama Meep mentioned, but how many people would waste 6 months of gaming soft inting the way you do just so they can lock their honour?

As a result of it, we've ran an investigation and we have found the following games containing hate speech:\n\n[2018-10-20 15:53:58 EEST] phantom9399: irelia just a salty c%%%% xD\n\n[8:20] Ahri: just blind the %%%% and stay back\n\n[2018-11-06 13:35:23 EET] phantom9399: %%%%s\n\nI am going to have to tell you that using such an inappropriate term will undoubtedly make people angry or at the very least less focused about the game and more focused to write to you a response and this may have even greater emotional impact on a person than you may think.\n\nThe language that you used has consequences and because of this we have decided to give you a suspension with which, we hope that you will reform yourself. The suspension has the following effects on your account:\n\n-A two-week period of time in which you will not be able to play games or use features like chat and gifting, however, you will still be able to use the store and view your in-client reform card.\n-Your Honor has dropped to level 0. Honor unlocks some time after your penalty as long as you're showing signs of progress\n-You are ineligible for any 2018 Season ranked or Honor rewards\n\nI am sure you were already aware of your behaviour, therefore, the aforementioned details might be just the confirmations you were looking for.\n\nKind regards,\n\nPrimo333\nVoid Players Support Specialist\n\n\"As was foreseen!\"\n\n\n\n\nPHANTOM9399\nNovember 10th 2018, 7:23:21 am\nYou support guys really are special aren't you. While I do say fair enough to the ban on flaming, not going to dispute that as it gets rid of my honor level and lets me know of another way to get players instantly banned after I troll and bait the shit out of them ingame.\n\nThe point of the report was to show you how flawed your report system is and you just proved my point once again. After this 14 day ban I can go back ingame, troll, throw wins, bait team mates into flaming (as long as I don't flame myself) and I will never be punished. As you have read in the in-game chats I even call out riot support ingame and still no punishment. Its actually a joke.\n\nI just love how you jump straight onto the flaming and don't even bother to mention me trolling, look at my last 3-5 matches. I threw my bronze 1 promo's unpurpose to piss off my team and get a reaction (it worked).\n\nHow about you guys do your jobs properly and take a look at the actual games themselves rather then just reading the chat, or more importantly read the chat properly and read the several numerous times I have admitted to trolling.\n\nThank god I don't have to say KYS ingame to get rid of this stupid honor shit as well, makes my life easier, now do me a favor and keep the shit locked when I get off my ban otherwise you will see me in here again in 3-6 months time to get the dam honor locked again.\n\n\nPHANTOM9399\nNovember 10th 2018, 7:31:13 am\nGame 1 \nIn-Game \nphantom9399: not his job to win your lane \nphantom9399: lol no \nphantom9399: rofl wp akali xd \nphantom9399: use wards \nphantom9399: stay under tower \nphantom9399: then you dont get ganked \nphantom9399: easy solution \nphantom9399: ULT DIDNT TRIGGER RIP! :( \nphantom9399: 70 hp \nphantom9399: 20 hp \nphantom9399: she hurts \nphantom9399: no, shes ... cranky... xD \nphantom9399: blitzCRANK, CRANKy... xd \nphantom9399: ult didnt go off again rip \nphantom9399: how do i veig rofl \nphantom9399: sent her to get bot tower as it was pissing me off, she goes in without a minion wave rofl \nphantom9399: lol \nPost-Game \nphantom9399: irelia \nphantom9399: you sit up lane \nphantom9399: no wards \nphantom9399: and vs a darius \nphantom9399: and expect ganks \nphantom9399: and wonder why olaf camped you \nphantom9399: why do you think i stayed under tower most of the game rofl \nphantom9399: cause fuck olafs ganks with akali \nphantom9399: you lost that lane yourself \nphantom9399: not kayn \nphantom9399: xD \nphantom9399: im chill \nphantom9399: irelia just a salty c%%%% xD \nphantom9399: gg xD \nGame 2 \nPre-Game \nphantom9399: just play what your comfortable on \nphantom9399: raka is good \nphantom9399: go raka \nIn-Game \nphantom9399: potatoes \nphantom9399: ah fuck \nphantom9399: teemo \nphantom9399: havnt played ahri in ages rofl \nphantom9399: lb how did you have 450 shutdown already?
