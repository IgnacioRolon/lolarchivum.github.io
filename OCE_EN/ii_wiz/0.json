Plus, I believe it could be a bit confusing for some players. I am fine with Skyping with my friends while I play, allowing for better use of tactics, but when there are people I don't know it can force me into situations where I am like \"Wait, who is telling me to help them?\"\nAlso, bandwidth might be a problem for some people, I suppose.","replies":[{"poster":"II Wiz","date":"2014-11-30T10:11:33.738+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"I don't believe \"toxicity\" or \"confusion\" should be a deciding factor here. At the end of the day, most players play the 5v5 modes provided in this game. That's 4 other people you have to depend on and relay information to effectively whilst still under the pressure of the game. \nThere's always the mute button if you come across the incessant whining of a 12v, just like you would in a game today. \nAnd basically, the same situations you've pointed out above happen in text form also. This isn't a particular \"Sound-whore\" dependant game either, so hearing the voices of my team mate rather than forceful ping would be great. And if you can play CS:GO with voice chat you can definitely play this too.","replies":[{"poster":"Slim Chaedi","date":"2014-11-30T10:24:52.513+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"It could always be something worth trialing, possibly mainly on the PBE. However, I don't think it is something that is required for LoL, and I find that the pings and stuff are sufficient when used properly. In addition, using your voice doesn't allow you to place a marker on the minimap.\nAlthough you haven't directly stated it, I agree that text-base communication can suck, especially if you are a slow typer. \nWorth trialing? Yes.\nRequired? No.\nAlso, Riot posted a thing on their reasons as to why they shouldn't have voice chat a while ago. I will see if I can dig it up for you.\nhttp://forums.na.leagueoflegends.com/board/showthread.php?p=48085298\nHere it is. You don't think toxicity should be a deciding factor, but Riot does. Ultimately, it is their decision. In addition though, a lot of comments in favour of voice chat seem to be quite downvoted.\nThough I don't completely disagree with voice chat being a bad idea for League, I don't quite like the idea of being thrown in to voice chat with strangers. I do voice chat with my friends while I play with them though. Would I like a feature in League that allows me to open up voice chat channels with my friends on League? Actually, I would like that. I would love that, especially since some of my friends use Skype and some of them use Teamspeak, and then some other channels.","replies":[{"poster":"II Wiz","date":"2014-11-30T11:17:39.030+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"I still don't see why all of you think that their voices are permanently in the game and cannot be silenced. Yes, if you have one bad egg in the bunch you can mute him/block him. How is that such a far-fetched idea in comparison to their current \"mute\" button for in-game text chat? \nI also cant believe how you take the above video as the video-bible to why we shouldn't have voice chat. Have you guys never heard of CoD? Halo? Rainbow Six? Counter-Strike? DOTA? These games are and were popular on a monumental scale, and voice chat just happens to be a \"use it if you want\" feature. There's nothing stopping players from muting others in their team or the whole team! \nDoesn't Riot think that it should also take steps to prevent toxicity rather than let it fester and not deal with it? I mean how many times/10 do you feel that you've lost a game due to lack of communication than to a blatant troll or AFK? Those situations you cannot control, but communication is something you CAN! And Riot doesn't even want to test that. \n\nWhat I'm asking can be portrayed in this scenario:\n\nYou and four other survivors are in the middle of the ocean (*Summoners Rift*), and you all come across 5 one-person dinghies *(the client, and all its features*) fitted with **both** a motor (*voice chat*) and paddles (*text chat/pinging*).\n\nYou are all aiming to gain access aboard a rescue ship (*victory*), and are fighting against another team (*self-explanatory, I hope*) of survivors for the 5 spots aboard the boat. \n\nNow what Riot wants to do is rip out the motor (or in this case, it was never there), and let you have a harder time to ATTEMPT to achieve the same result. Meanwhile the other team may all have sorted out a skype/raidcall/ventrillo/teamspeak/idk call just for the one match and give each other a better chance at winning through aided communication. It doesn't equal an instant win, but having developed or developing brains, you understand that if there is a risk-free option to better your chances you may as well take it.\n\nIt's not Riots fault that a fraction of its players happen to be silly 12v brats with nothing better to do but say nasty things, I understand that. But what's boggling me is that they do not want to go down this avenue and help out the players who DO want a better chance. \n\nIf you can only see negatives to this then I'm sorry. you're only adding to the toxicity problem to me.","replies":[{"poster":"Slim Chaedi","date":"2014-11-30T12:20:34.687+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I find it kind of insulting that I approach the topic with an open mind and talk about the pros and cons, while also talking about different ways it could be approached rather than the conventional approach, yet you seem to just turn to me and say \"No, you are wrong, this is how it definitely is and how it definitely should be.\"\nYou talk about how being matched against a premade group would hinder the opposing team as they'd use voice chat and the other team wouldn't be doing so, completely ignoring my suggestions. Here's the deal: premade groups will often be matched up against premade groups, and there is an equal chance of both parties using voice chat. I suggested that you could possibly do voice chat through the LoL client with friends. That way, premades probably would have easy access to voice chat anyway. I don't like the idea of being thrown into and being pressured into voice chat with strangers though, and I am sure many people feel the same way. You talk about how so many successful games have voice chat, but have you played them and witnessed how much people often just yell at each other through them when playing with strangers?\nNow, you are saying I see only the negatives in this, but let me just quote myself:\n> \"Would I like a feature in League that allows me to open up voice chat channels with my friends on League? Actually, I would like that. I would love that\"\n\nIt is rude that you tell me I am only seeing the negatives when I am openly endorsing the use of voice chat as a communication tool for League of Legends... with friends. Just because I don't agree with the scope of voice chat which you endorse, doesn't mean I am shutting down the whole concept. Here's the deal: I would like to see some form of this come to League, but don't think it is required. However, I would not like to be pressured into having to use voice chat to properly communicate with people on my team.\nAlso:\n> CoD? Halo? Rainbow Six? Counter-Strike?\n\nThey have no pinging systems and I don't see how they could really put them in.\nAnd by the way, I didn't even watch the video. But if what they say is similar to what I say, then obviously my views have some credibility and should not simply be dismissed.\n\ntl;dr: Please, don't ignore what I say and treat my views as irrelevant because I don't 100% agree with you. If you aren't prepared for someone to debate the topic with you to some degree, then don't post about it.\n> If you can only see negatives to this then I'm sorry. you're only adding to the toxicity problem to me.\n\n I really don't see where you pulled that from when I clearly stated the voice chat is good.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"JasonWazza","date":"2014-11-30T10:17:29.715+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa9pxW4G4jQ","replies":[{"poster":"Zero Infinity","date":"2014-11-30T10:40:08.943+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Funny stuff!","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Nasedra Rheold","date":"2014-12-03T05:40:19.577+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"nty its a bad idea, there are already a multitude of services that do this for us (ie Skype vent ts) and those services dnt require us to spam mute everyone before a game starts.
