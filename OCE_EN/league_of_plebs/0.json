Keep in mind i'm not wanting this feature implemented so i can just make every single person i don't like banned from being on my team, this is entirely aimed at removing AFK people, and trolls.\r\n\r\n\r\nBefore voting please consider the pro's and con's of what this feature could bring. I love the idea of the feature, but even i know and can see many flaws in it, so i'm still undecided if we should implement it, but getting everyone to vote is allows for some exposure to the idea so please up this thread :)\r\n\r\n\r\n**Pro's**\r\nWon't be paired with someone you have a huge disagreement with.\r\nLess Trolls.\r\nCan avoid double losses due to one person.\r\n\r\n**Cons**\r\nLong queue times\r\nPotentially abusable \r\nCan Essentially remove all bad players from your game (Pro or Con?)\r\n\r\n\r\nThere is quite obviously many many more factors to take in, but i felt these were the most prominent. I also think that this is something that should have some restriction added too it, for example;\r\n\r\nOnly in ranked\r\nCertain # per day ( Avoids retards just getting rid of everyone who had a bad game, and focuses on **AFK** people and **TROLLS** )\r\nCan only ban them from results at the end of the game (Similar to honour)\r\nMust be on your team.","replies":[{"poster":"Slim Chaedi","date":"2014-12-03T14:47:16.468+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yes, consideration.
