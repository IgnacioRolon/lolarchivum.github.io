I won&#039;t lie I downloaded a 3rd party program and used it only in **custom games with bots** because I was very curious how this things work. I then deleted the program and continue playing normal games with friends. Today out of the blue I got kicked out of the game and received a permanent ban with no warning. To be honest I wasn&#039;t sure if it was legal to use that 3rd party program that&#039;s why I only used it with bots. Is there any way to recover the account? I am playing LoL for over 4-5 years and this is the first time I am getting banned and **permanently**!","replies":[{"poster":"Lord Sesshomaru","date":"2017-10-30T08:04:34.293+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Unfortunately there is a 0 tolerance policy for 3rd party programs, there is no warning shot.\nThis is harsh to be sure, and unfortunately people like yourself get caught up in it, but hacks and other unfair advantages have such a major negative impact upon the enjoyment and fairness of games, that any leniency on the matter would allow for people to abuse the system.\n\nWe all know the pains of aim-bots on games like CoD, or hackers on games like Day-z, and no one has fun! \nLeague is a game that is for the most part without much of that at all, and so players can feel secure in league, but that is primarily due to Riot's heavy stance on the matter. So while the punishments are harsh, _(especially in cases like yours when no other player has been affected)_, it is perhaps a necessary evil.\n\nI suspect that the system that detects 3rd party programs _(either intentionally or otherwise)_, doesn't distinguish between custom and pvp games.\n\nI am really sorry to hear that you've been banned, especially when you feel like you haven't done anything wrong as no one else was affected.\nI know what you feel, one of my friends was banned in a similar situation in a custom game. _(I had no knowledge he was using other programs or I would have stopped him)_. It really doesn't feel fair, but it is the harshness of the system that keeps league secure.\n\nI agree that perhaps a little more in-client visibility confirming that 3rd party programs are not acceptable in any part of the game, even in customs, could go a long way in protecting players like yourself who didn't realise there was a 0 tolerance policy!\nHowever riot keep the detection system a closely guarded secret, _(the more hackers know about it, the more they can adapt their programs to beat it, and no one wants that)_, so I'm not sure how much visibility would be acceptable without jeopardizing the integrity of the system.\n\nI am sorry :(","replies":[]},{"poster":"Bronze 6 Yasuo","date":"2017-10-30T05:28:43.351+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"{{sticker:zombie-brand-facepalm}} whyyyyyyy??????","replies":[]},{"poster":"SOOM","date":"2017-10-30T02:11:24.021+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yeah sorry dude using a hacked client is an instant ban no way to recover man\nBest thing to do is make a new account..\nSorry dude","replies":[]},{"poster":"Plutooh","date":"2017-10-31T19:53:49.747+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Once a cheater always a cheater, no offence but good riddance.
