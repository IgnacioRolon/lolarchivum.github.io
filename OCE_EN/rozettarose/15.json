We were also playing with some friends who were new to the game so it was fair that we would separate ourselves from being on the same team. \r\n\r\nLike maybe it was the fact they were playing champs they played a bit in the past who are also strong late game such as Trynd, Mord, Illoi  \r\n\r\nand me being stuck with some squishy champs who cant really do much late game.\r\n\r\nBesides that I honestly really felt like maybe I should give up idk its really put me down especially when they kept joking around with me saying they are better then me and all that shit. \r\n\r\nmaybe i'm just in a shit mood because of it all. SO someone please enlighten me or give me the hard truth.","replies":[{"poster":"DarkShade918","date":"2019-06-21T01:35:07.912+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Here's My 2 Cents\n\nTrynd is very strong right now, as is Morde, Illaoi on the other hand (imo) is the most balanced champ in the top lane.\n\nDon't get down that you got beaten by high tier champs, learn their counters\n- Trynd, Suffers to Team Ganking, Hard CC and has no teamfight presence, he has to split or 1v1/1v2 in order to be useful\n- Morde, Similar situation, Suffers to being team ganked, just make sure that the weakest of the team is not near enough to morde for him to ult them\n- Illaoi, Just build Morellos, Executioners or Bramble Vest and don't let her take your soul, nor let her fight in anything more than a 1v1 or 1v2\n\nAll 3 of these champs are very single/double target focused, ie. they're fucking useless in any other situation\n\nYou're also getting in your own head, by assuming that your friend might be better than you, and letting him Tilt you/Get under your skin. \n\nContrary to how gameplay shows, League is not in fact a game about skill (at least in Elo's below Diamond) it becomes a 20:80, 20% skill, 80% mind games. That 80 can then be dropped into to 40s, 40% your mind, 40% your opponents.\n\nIf you see duelists, DO NOT PICK SQUISHIES, you will die, very quickly","replies":[]},{"poster":"adceazyas123","date":"2019-06-20T20:22:58.811+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"who cares, its OCE. it literally means nothing.","replies":[]},{"poster":"TheDemonEmperor","date":"2019-06-20T16:03:54.298+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":">  \n* **improve **at league, I wanted to eventually **stream **the games I played as well.\n* barely has mastered champs is **better then me**\n* **kept joking** around with me saying they are ** better then me** and all that shit. \n\nThose points that stand out to me and the key words that I've highlighted. Are the problems regarding your inner turmoil. \n\nYou yourself know that your ability are inferior even when compared to a small circle of friends. The chances of making it big and play well enough to attract viewers is merely wishful thinking. And yet, streaming is not about how capable one play, but rather how interesting one can be. \n\nHowever, you’ve failed to mention how well your entertainment skills would place you among the ranking. Was this on purpose, because it slip your mind? or was it not worth mentioning. If you don't have neither the skills nor the personality to attract viewers, the logical conclusion would be dropping your preset goal. \n\nWhen you’ve brought up, your friends are better than you, **twice**. Would it be fair to say they've also mocked your idea of becoming a streamer and giving good performance? Generally people don't mock other, if they know the person have the capability to reach their goal. Or, the person is humble and not boastful. Am getting a sense of you boasting to them at the beginning and when they've overtaken you, you are now the butt of the joke.\n\nThis has nothing to do with league. But rather your friends words are now starting to hurt your feelings and you don't know how to convey it to them. Perhaps you thought the quickest ways to be rid of their insults is by stop playing the game. \n\nTo sum it up, tell your friends or whatever they are to you; To stop teasing you. That will make your problem go away and you wont feel like shit when you lose. Also, you might wanna stop boasting, if you are doing that.","replies":[]}]}
