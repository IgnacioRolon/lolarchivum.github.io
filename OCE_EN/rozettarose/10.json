Items should be received by everyone. Don't find it fair that someone can get two items and someone wont get any. But i hear riot is already aware of this and working on it. \r\n\r\n2. The person in first place shouldn't go against the person in last place or anyone in lower positions. I think its super unfair, I understand that point is too knock out players but give the players in lower position a chance to actually get somewhere. Someone in 3rd-4th place has a higher chance of beating top player rather than someone in very last or close to it. Top players should vs each other and low players should vs each other, till people start getting knocked out.","replies":[]}
