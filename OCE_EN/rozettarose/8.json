I'd say it's probably unlikely you'll get enough for Prestige K/DA Kai'Sa, but there is still a possibility (however slim). Even without considering Prestige Kai'Sa, the loot will be around for a while yet (until the 3rd of December), and you'll have your pick of all of it (so long as you have enough tokens). No harm in waiting a few more days.","replies":[{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2018-11-17T01:21:59.549+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"~~Just to clarify, the Worlds loot will be coming back and available for a while, but the K/DA loot will only be available until the 20th.~~\n\n~~>[K/DA: November 3, 2018 at 9:00 p.m. AEDT – November 20, 2018 at 18:59 p.m. AEDT](https://oce.leagueoflegends.com/en/news/game-updates/special-event/learn-more-worlds-season-2018-event)~~\n\n~~So OP has that long to earn enough for the Prestige skin :)~~\n\nI take it all back, they've changed things :)\n\nhttps://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/360011804033\n\n>Worlds, Tales from the Rift, and K/DA content will be available for crafting (except Worlds and Spooky Position Orbs) again between November 16, 2018 at 8:00 a.m. PT to December 3, 2018 at 11:59 p.m. PT.
