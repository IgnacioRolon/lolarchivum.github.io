Logged on to find out that KDA Ahri can only be bought through prestige points ! \r\n\r\nAre you serious!? I can understand with Aatrox but KDA Ahri? Why?\r\n\r\nShe is still part of KDA so why did you have to do missions for Akali and Kai Sa but not Ahri ?? Thats so dumb and disappointing. \r\n\r\nI do remember riot saying that getting prestige skins was something to make a player feel like they had accomplished something, by playing through games and completing missions to earn the skin. But all you do is wast your money to earn prestige points!! That doesn't make a player feel like they've really earned the skin or achieved anything, just make a player feel like they've wasted money. \r\n\r\nI didn't get the Kai sa skin because i didn't earn enough points in time and i wasn't going to get the Akali because I don't like her, so when i heard about Ahri i was excited since I already have the KDA Ahri skin, I was planning on trying to earn her prestige skin. \r\n\r\nI assume a lot of other players would be very disappointed. Hope maybe Riot will consider changing that but I highly doubt it.","replies":[]}
