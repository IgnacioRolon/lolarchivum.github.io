It's also very questionable that it's complicated enough or not explained in such a way for the purchaser to understand. I love riot like any other fan but they still have their kinks.","replies":[{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2019-09-23T11:48:47.649+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I agree that it should be clearer that the borders are included (it really only tells you by the image), but that may be due to limitations of the store display? I don't really know. I can't really see any reason not to include it unless they can't without some substantial backend work.\n\nAs for the price itself, ultimately we speak with our wallets. Personally, I don't feel the borders are ever worth it, and so would never buy a bundle with a border unless it was cheaper than buying the content I wanted individually, but that's a personal preference. Some people really dig the borders and they have a lot more value to those people. That's not for me to decide as one person.","replies":[{"poster":"bgentle2myashe","date":"2019-09-25T04:07:33.338+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I do agree and understand the idea of commercialization in it's form of growth but I always liked to think of Riot as one of those companies still had more values than not that stayed true to it's roots. There are a lot of values which this is the case like league still being f2p and having so much emphasis still put on surveys etc to keep the game a \"peoples game\". \nI do wish that riot would come up with a system that would reward and put more value into the loyal and non toxic rioters. That in itself would create less issues and more happiness but easy for me say I'm not on inside dealing with that they have to deal with. \n\nAs for the boarders I like them but I wouldn't go out of my way for one or several.","replies":[{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2019-09-25T11:54:31.779+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"That's essentially what the honour system is. Honour itself yields rewards, and keys are tied to honour as well. \n\nUsed to be the only cosmetic content you could earn was the Victorious skins at the end of each season. Now we have free hextech chests, token events (you don't get much but I've earned quite a few ward skins for free), essence emporium twice yearly, etc.\n\nWhile I can't wholly agree with Riot's direction as far as prestige and loot boxes go, there is way more free cosmetic content available than there used to be.","replies":[{"poster":"bgentle2myashe","date":"2019-09-26T03:43:07.922+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"No you're right. I have had 3 skins bought for me by really generous rioters who liked my game play so much and were so surprised I didn't have a skin on a champion I was so good at so they bought it for me. Other than that every skin, ward skin, emote and boarder I have has been free. I have gotten a few from my twitch prime sub rewards but I honestly don't feel there is enough value in spending real money on in game things so I support riot in other ways.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]}]}
