So if riot ever see's this pleaseeeeeeeeeeee consider giving Kindred an awesome new skin! &lt;3","replies":[{"poster":"Jager470","date":"2019-01-03T22:34:58.842+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"LISTEN BUDDY, people have been asking riot for this for quite a while now. but the fact of the matter is riot will always give the fanboys what they want, KDA akali for exp.","replies":[{"poster":"RozettaRose","date":"2019-03-01T04:12:55.908+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"wait I can't tell if you getting angry or you are agreeing with me?","replies":[]}]}]}
