Probably in interface options.\r\n* Add another rank in between recruit and officer. Allow that rank to invite people but do nothing else. Limits griefing.\r\n* A feature to organise events quickly or send out messages (notifications) to everyone in your club.\r\n* Change the tag of you&#039;re club, maybe once a week or something like the Ranked 5s add new players.\r\n* Ability to add notes or group individual players in your club, i.e By Rank, Most played champion or custom by leader.\r\n* Ability to organise people, like your friends list, to sort club members by status rather than by name.\r\nDate that members joined, like Ranked 5s.","replies":[{"poster":"Limely","date":"2016-03-16T03:33:16.251+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thank you for your feedback! We have a lot of polish tasks on our plate, but will keep these in mind. \n\nMeanwhile, if you want to hide your tag in game, you can click on the gear in the upper right on the clubs panel (middle tab in your friends list), and uncheck the box there. Your club name and tag will not show to other players. \n\nHope this helps!","replies":[]}]}
