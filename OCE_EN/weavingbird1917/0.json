When the game was loading, it crashed and I had to reconnect. No biggie, I thought. I participated a lot in my team and ended up having one of the highest kills and gold earned. When I exited, a leaver buster warning came up and said that I LEAVED the match or WAS AFK. Wait, what? Just look at my battle results and you know I definitely was not AFK. And I certainly stayed till the end of the game. \r\n\r\nNow I am put into a LOWER priority queue and have to wait FIVE minutes JUST to get into ONE game. This is just ridiculous. This is not the first time. This KEEPS happening. I cannot stand this. Please tell me how to fix this or fix the game.\r\n\r\nThanks.","replies":[{"poster":"Wuks","date":"2016-01-07T23:33:33.622+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey WeavingBird1917,\n\n\nI've had my fair share of Bug Splats during my time with League of Legends, so I totally know how frustrating and obstructive they can be. I'm going to list a few solutions below; if you've already done certain steps, feel free to skip to the next one. Be sure to test your game in a custom match to determine whether your Bug Splats still persist. \n\n_______________________________\nThe first resource to try is the [**Bug Splat and Game Crashes**](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201761974-Bug-Splat-and-Game-Crashes) Riot Games Support article. It has a long list of the most common causes of Bug Splat errors, so hopefully the solution that works for you is in this article. As mentioned in the article, Bug Splats can be caused by other applications, such as LoLReplay, Curse Voice, and Elophant Client, interfering with League of Legends. Be sure to go through as many steps as you can before continuing on. \n__________________________________\nIf that doesn't work, go to \n>C:\\Riot Games\\League of Legends\\RADS\\solutions\\lol_game_client_sln\\releases\\\\{**highest version number**}\\deploy\n\n\nRight click on \"**League of Legends.exe**\", click on \"**Properties**\", check \"**Run this program in compatibility mode for:**\", and select \"**Windows 7**\" in the dropdown selection menu. \n__________________________________\nThe next thing to try is to run a complete anti-virus scan on your computer. If you don't currently have an anti-virus software, I would recommend one of the two following software:\n\n\n* [**ESET NOD32 Antivirus (with a 30-day trial)**](http://download.eset.com/special/live-installer/us/eset_nod32_antivirus_live_installer.exe)\n* [**MalwareBytes Free**](https://www.malwarebytes.org/mwb-download/)\n\n\nOnce the scan is complete, remove any malware that is detected, reboot your computer, and re-install League of Legends, using the steps recommended in the [**Reinstalling League of Legends**](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/202539040-Reinstalling-League-of-Legends) Riot Games Support article:\n\n\n>#REINSTALLING LEAGUE OF LEGENDS\n\n>1. If you have experienced problems reinstalling the game in the past, you may want to consider running a registry cleaner before reinstalling the game. [**CCleaner**](http://www.filehippo.com/download_ccleaner/) is a common registry cleaner that many players have found useful. You may also want to try creating a new Windows administrative account in the Control Panel to install the game.\n2. Download the latest version of League of Legends from https://signup.leagueoflegends.com/en/signup/redownload\nRun LeagueofLegends.exe to download updated versions of our setup files. The setup files will be placed in a new League of Legends folder on your desktop by default.\n3. When the setup files finish downloading, the installation process will begin automatically. If possible, install League of Legends to the default C:\\ drive.\nWhen the installation process finishes, the game's launcher will open automatically. If you need to open the game manually, please do so by double clicking the League of Legends desktop shortcut, or by running lol.launcher.exe in the directory to which you installed League of Legends.\n\n_____________________________\n\nLet me know if you're still encountering problems so we can try other steps if necessary!","replies":[]}]}
