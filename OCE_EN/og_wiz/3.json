I don't know if they've got something for Spotify though and if they do I don't know if it will be what you want.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Voxie","date":"2015-09-09T09:59:09.491+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Nah brother if your League is full screen I don't think it's possible. But I'm able to make my currently playing iTunes song come up if I have League in windowed mode. Spotify should be the same, try the settings :)","replies":[{"poster":"OG Wiz","date":"2015-09-09T10:41:34.796+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'll give it a go thanks bro. :)","replies":[]}]}]}
