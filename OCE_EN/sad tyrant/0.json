You play a champ that kills regardless of the 5% damage. (Veigar, who even has the passive to make it a lot better, I'm considering skipping chalice completely and going for boots and 5 full AP items because of how effective it is)\n2. You play a champ that doesn't even deal that much damage (Soraka, who has serious mana issues early on and doesn't even scale that well in terms of damage)\n3. When mana beats damage on extremely mana hungry champs early on (Maybe Swain or Anivia, and possibly Veigar for farming in lane)\n\nSo I'd pick 5% damage when I'm playing a poke champ, non caster ADC or non mana champ.\n\nBUT, on champions like Lucian and Ashe who are marksmen don't have mana problems later on but have really powerful abilities, I like to go 3 on one and 2 on the other.","replies":[{"poster":"GigaPube","date":"2015-12-01T06:06:50.494+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"okey dokey, but the next time you let someone escape with a slither of health, you be thankful you have that miniscule missing mana regen over more points in merciless. especially in the late game, when kills and not dying is the most important thing in the game, and mana is absolutely not an issue on anyone even if they normally do or dont build around more mana/regen as their items. ESPECIALLY LUCIAN, who now builds essence reaver, of all items.\n\nsoraka.....really m8.....but veigar would still want merciless, you dont ALWAYS blow people up, you might still be behind but you can almost always get them low, if not lower with this mastery, if you use full combo. but he has an in-build mana font.....so thats some pretty bad examples. so pretty much soraka, some other low damage supports like alistar and.......i cant think of any.......even blitz, if he pulls an adc at 50%, they're now down to 40%, an E and an ult might now do a further 2% of their health if the E-ult does 30% of their health and then it might only take 1-2 autos from adc to finish them off instead of 3 which the adc might not get if they flash under tower","replies":[{"poster":"TeCoolMage","date":"2015-12-01T16:20:11.515+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Alright, and next time I go OOM as an AP champ when the enemy is one ability away from dying, I'll be glad my auto attack can deal 5% more damage.\n\nWith Veigar, I always blow people up, or I never get close. I can't think of a time when 5% damage would've put anything I've busted but failed to kill over the line, and if that did happen, it wouldn't if my Athene's slot had something with 100 AP. Also, he doesn't really gain a mana font, but he gains a mana font font, which increases his mana font per missing mana. Even more so if I had to recall because I didn't have enough mana in lane, giving me less AP for later game.\n\nI've only played Lucian once but I didn't get any mana issues even without essence reaver (I can't remember if I had meditation but I'm pretty sure I didn't) so I'm starting to feel like it's an oddly shaped piece that fits neither Ezreal nor Lucian.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Sad Tyrant","date":"2015-11-30T09:59:17.403+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"1.5% of missing mana per five,  this has a very profound effect especially in the early game. take {{champion:45}} for example. hypothetical situation you just killed someone and used all of your mana. now lets say you have about 600 total mana and have a natural regen rate of 9. the 1.5% regen for missing mana is equal to nine. 18 per five then Veigar's passive (18 * 2.5 = 45) that is equal to 9 mana in one second, which decreases the amount of time you would be vulnerable to encounters with the enemy jungler as you make your way back to the tower.\n\nThe Cunning tree adds a huge amount of utility and most supports need to invest 12-18 points in it. But you to have an open mind to try new things, experiment, if you want to build Tri force on Shen, go do it (no, I don't do it) not everyone has to build a champion, Runes and Masteries the way you do, even if it is not meta. please watch the next five to 10 minutes of this video. https://youtube/VDiGkPAtups?t=8m21s . it'll give a better overlook for the cunning tree.
