It opened up so many new opportunities for me and allowed me to try new things that previously were not as viable.\n\nWhen a champ's kit is overloaded or doesn't allow for counterplay, there must be some change that Riot implements. Such as Darius' Q.\n\nOn the flipside, Urgot and Galio (as examples) were very uncommon champs and both had below average winrates for most patches. Their kits were outdated and clunky. The majority of players considered them boring to play or they were just too far outside the meta to be considered decent picks.\n\nChamps are updated in order to make them more in-tune with the current meta and the directions in which the game has been going. They may be inconvenient for the minority of players, but they are convenient for the majority of players.","replies":[]},{"poster":"FoulFumes","date":"2017-08-11T19:29:55.471+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"i miss the old taric and the old gangplank let along sword of the occult i feel Zilean needs a touch up tho he is not changed in so long","replies":[{"poster":"She Loves Me","date":"2017-08-16T10:29:35.819+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I saw someone straight up Q a vayne as Gangplank the other day for 90% of her hp due to Duskblade {{item:3147}}  It brought back memories of the critplank haha xD","replies":[]},{"poster":"Gesteppie","date":"2017-08-13T22:49:57.460+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Zilean needs a good bug fixing first!!!\nSo many times have i tried to grant someone a level, and it has used E instead, sending them flying off away from me ;_;","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Sp1rit Rush","date":"2017-08-11T03:49:46.045+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I want poppies old ult back...","replies":[]},{"poster":"Akkordian Zoeve","date":"2017-08-10T10:29:54.405+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Evelynn OTP here... hoping they don't ruin her with the rework.\n\nThe fact Galio is *nothing* like his pre-rework worries me.","replies":[{"poster":"Razör","date":"2017-08-10T19:08:32.746+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"i mained both shen and galio before rework both champs are so different for me and just not worth it.\nSure they have there place but its not the same for me","replies":[]}]}]}
