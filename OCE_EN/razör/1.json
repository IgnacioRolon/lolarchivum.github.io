You may want to use Riven when she's in the free rotation, to see her abilities so you know what to do to kill her.\n\nXin Zhao will be able to finish Riven off at least once before level 6, due to his insane amount of attack damage and life steal, and if he managed to kill Riven at least twice before level 6, Riven would be screwed for practically the rest of the game, which means she would not be able to kill Xin Zhao without help from ganks. Riven cannot kill Xin Zhao 1v1 before she gets to level 6, which gives Xin Zhao an advantage to finish her off. Once Riven gets to level 6 and she ults you, knock her back using your ult and retreat, wait for her ult to finish before you go in on her again (you may not need to do this if you are far ahead of Riven). Get triforce and build lifesteal.\n\nFiora can also kill Riven before level 6, just keep auto attacking her, and go in on her using your Q, parry her Q knockup use your W if you can, do not be afraid of trading with her before she gets to level 6, even if you want to avoid getting hit by some of Riven's skillshots, Riven will be really scared of trading with you once she realized how much damage you deal to her. If you managed to kill her once but you fall behind and Riven got to Level 6 before you do, don't give her kills, and if she ults you, run away if you can even if you are ahead (unless if you have enough items to sustain her ult's passive and active to kill her). Build lifesteal.\n\nGaren will also be able to kill Riven, in level 1, just autoattack and Q, Riven can't do much about this if she starts with her Q (if she starts with her shield, she can't do anything else but autoattacking you, or else run away). In level 2 be more careful, if Riven gets her W, just go in with Q and E, and she will take a huge amount of damage. If she gets her E (her shield) in level 2, wait for her to engage with her Q or wait for her shield to be out of the way before you go into trade. In level 3, always wait for her to use her shield, or wait for her to engage on you with her Q, before you go into trade. Once she gets to level 6, if she ults you, provided that you are not behind and you know you have an advantage to kill her, use your ult on her at the proper moment. Build tank/armor (start with cloth armor and potions). AD Garen sucks.\n\nThere are other champions like Hecarim, Malphite, Olaf, etc, they can beat Riven too, but I will not give explanation since I have never used these champions against Riven, therefore I cannot give you advice.\n\nSomething else I would like to mention to you is that you need good runes on your rune pages, you can wait for runes reforged (which will come in this December).\nIf you already have adequate runes on your rune pages, just do what I tell you to do, and you should be able to kill Riven.\n\nIf you need more information, head over to the page below, and click on the link in that page which lead you to reddit, there will be explanations on how to beat Riven by most top laners.\nhttps://boards.oce.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/miscellaneous/Mnyan14Z-how-to-beat-riven-in-any-matchup-taken-from-reddit?show=new","replies":[{"poster":"Razör","date":"2017-09-16T04:02:25.390+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"cheers man","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Fitzky","date":"2017-09-16T00:02:36.802+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"After playing the champion myself quite a few times I can come to the conclusion that Riven is pretty balanced apart from her Ultimate ability. An AD steroid PLUS an execute in one ability is a bit too much IMO. Quite often I've even just pressed r to use the wind slash to finish off a low health opponent. The thing essentially feels like a double ultimate on a champion that already has no mana or energy. Imagine pressing one button to activate a singed ult and have an AOE garen ult at the same time. I feel as if one of the two needs to be nerfed a little, would help in not getting deleted in under 2 seconds because a level 7 riven animation cancelled her ultimate so she already had it up and was on top of me ready to use wind slash if I try to flash away.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Aguy77","date":"2017-09-15T19:13:57.909+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"{{champion:86}} {{champion:122}} {{champion:80}} here you go, problem solved, now quit complaining about one of the weakest top-laners in the game just because she s**t on you as {{champion:17}} jungle and has high mobility, skill cap, and outplay potential\n\nMight as well ask riot to nerf {{champion:157}} too","replies":[{"poster":"Razör","date":"2017-09-16T03:57:58.699+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"sure\nriot nerf yas","replies":[{"poster":"Razör","date":"2017-09-16T03:58:42.997+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"done","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Razör","date":"2017-09-15T18:05:55.851+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"4 dashes no energy\ninsane ad scale on all but her W\nthe bullshit broken animation cancel\nno downside to diving at all","replies":[{"poster":"Aguy77","date":"2017-09-15T21:37:33.514+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"{{champion:91}} can jump over *unique* walls infinitely with no mana cost\n{{champion:103}}  can dash WHILE FIRING BOLTS with Spirit Rush AND \"Spirit Rush can be cast twice more within 10 seconds of activation at no additional cost before going on cooldown.\"\nChampions with figuratively \"overpowered\" dashes is nothing new, if people in gold can learn to deal with it so can you, if you're bronze/silver then what are you doing complaining about balance\n\n(+ 40 / 45 / 50 / 55 / 60% AD)  is not \"Insane\" she doesn't even receive a whole point of damage per AD she has and hardly goes over half of her total AD, and with the low base damage to begin with her Q isn't even that bad\nHer other abilities only scale off of Bonus AD which instantly knocks about 50-100 damage off depending on level. literally an entire item worth of damage cut off.\n\nThe animation cancels are what separate the good {{champion:92}} players from the bad, {{champion:19}} has a ton of animation cancels just like {{champion:157}},{{champion:86}},{{champion:122}} {{champion:58}} and almost every other champion in the game, and RIOT knew when they made her that they wanted her to play like a 2D fighter champion (like someone from street fighter) and chose to include the animation cancels as part of her kit, certain champions such as {{champion:104}} had unintended animation cancels (Dashing forward during his ult, the ult which is scripted to knock you back) which were patched very shortly after their discovery\n\nThe downside to diving is getting hard CC'd or outplayed and then killed, if you're getting successfully dived by a {{champion:92}}  chances are she's already fed and it's too late, in the same sense I guess theres no downside to diving as {{champion:103}} {{champion:266}} {{champion:18}} {{champion:23}} or {{champion:36}} either","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"CHEESYLEEKS","date":"2017-09-16T00:24:34.995+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Riven gets shit on by most toplaners\n\nQuit whining","replies":[]}]}
