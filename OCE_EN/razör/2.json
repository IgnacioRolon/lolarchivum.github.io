Maraudaur is an example of one whose does, but for the most part, if they are posting on boards they are doing it in their own time.\n\nThis is essentially the purpose of the volunteers (the Green, Blue, Yellow and Purple names). We exist to help take some of the load off the Rioters (who have other things that need doing) and to get answers to players faster. Of course we can't answer everything either, but we do what we can, especially when it comes to general questions.\n\nIts also worth noting that not all volunteers are moderators, only Emissaries (Green), Instructors (Blue) and Wrenchmen (Yellow).","replies":[]},{"poster":"Fitzky","date":"2017-08-23T03:35:24.506+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Are you referring to Riot themselves or the green, blue and purple people?","replies":[{"poster":"Razör","date":"2017-08-23T04:28:23.934+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Riot","replies":[{"poster":"Fitzky","date":"2017-08-23T04:38:59.878+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Riot sees pretty much every post they are just lazy and only comment on really important stuff otherwise that's what the special coloured people are for.","replies":[]}]}]}]}
