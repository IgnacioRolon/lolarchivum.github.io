Summoner 4 was stuck on 0 seconds, after about 30 seconds I get kicked for not picking a champion and locking in. Even though on my client it never allowed me to pick someone and their summoner 4 was still banning at 0 seconds. This is the second time its happened to me this week -.- every time it happens thats -3LP for &quot;dodging.&quot; Its not much but its irritating that its happened twice.\r\nPlease tell me whats wrong or can you give me my LP back xD","replies":[{"poster":"SephirothSG","date":"2016-05-14T09:15:41.616+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey there,\n\nThis sounds like it might be an intermittent connection issue on your end, could you please run through the [Troubleshooting Connection Issues](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues) article and let me know if the issue persists.\n\nI'd also recommend [running a client repair](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201761974-Bug-Splat-and-Game-Crashes#wq6), just to be sure that it's not your client causing the issues.","replies":[]}]}
