It&#039;s literally impossible to climb with any champion these days people are just forced to pick META champs which is so anti-fun in my opinion.\r\n\r\nHonestly the game makes no sense, why do the roles in LoL mean nothing, for example you have tanks whom can do enough damage to 100-0 champions or in some cases do more damage than carries without any damage items or just one damage item.\r\n\r\nTanks should be Tanks\r\n\r\nDamage dealers should be damage dealers\r\n\r\nAnything else creates an imbalance in the game, what is the point of playing a champion like for example lets say Riven if you are just going to get smashed as soon as Top Naut gets a chain vest even if you managed to kill him at least once in lane. Yet let&#039;s say the situation is reversed and you die to Naut 1v1 in lane, Naut will absolutely smash you and snowball out of control being able to 100-0 with ease with literally 0 damage items he just tanks everything and smashes your head in with items that contradict roles like Sunfire Cape.\r\n\r\nIt&#039;s so contradicting, why do we have items like sunfire cape if you&#039;re playing a tank champion you should just be completely tank.\r\n\r\nFeels like this is just a result of Riot trying to make the game more fun for the people who complain when they play a TANK champion or role when they can&#039;t 100-0 people as it is simply just not fun.\r\n\r\nAlso what is with nerfing champions with high skill caps to be on par with champions that have 0 skill cap YOU should be rewarded for being good at a champion e.g. (Being able to hit mad Nid spears or do an awesome Riven combo) Instead it&#039;s like why bother playing these champions if you can just pick Naut, Poppy, Lulu and do just as well without having to land nice skill shots of animation cancel well.\r\n\r\nRiot you really need to stop balancing the game based on what majority complain about and start listening to the feedback of players from the highest level.","replies":[{"poster":"TrashDonnut","date":"2016-03-13T06:10:46.564+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"If \"OP\" champs are played every game, then you should know by know the counters to them","replies":[{"poster":"FroggyFreshJr","date":"2016-03-13T06:34:29.295+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"That is the most stupid logic I have ever heard, They are the most played champions for a reason simply because the game is in such an imbalanced state. How do you counter champs like Naut? you don't because they have 0 skill cap and 0 outplay ability.
