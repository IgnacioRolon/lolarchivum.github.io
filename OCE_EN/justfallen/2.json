Given the feedback from the previous event, the team are now much more organised and much better prepared to bring even more quality for both the teams and the viewers in the Auspicious Gaming June Open.\r\n\r\nAbout Auspicious Gaming\r\nWe are a brand new tournament platform giving players a competitive environment in which they can thrive. With our local team we are pushing to broadcast casual couch-style commentary over our livestream with plenty of room for community interaction. We plan to do this through promoting community written questions, articles and hot discussion topics. We also plan on bringing aspiring shoutcasters on board and giving them a chance to cast live games.\r\n\r\nStill not convinced? Here are the highlights from our March event.\r\n\r\nWe hope to bring weekly tournaments as well as in-house events with prizes to be handed out at every opportunity.
