I bought 1 champ at in 2014 not long before I quit. I have not played since but want to get back into league. It would be great if there is a way I can either change summoner&#039;s name of merge accounts as I was still playing bots due to my skill level and cannot really make an impact on other players.","replies":[{"poster":"SephirothSG","date":"2016-12-29T19:58:22.708+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey there,\n\nAccount merges no longer exist and were only offered for a limited time under certain circumstances.\n\nOne of your options,  should you wish to use your old account under your new name would be to purchase a name change under your old account.\n\nAlthough by the sounds of it you already control both accounts with the name you have and the name you want, your best bet in this situation would be to [submit a ticket](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/requests/new) to Player Support detailing your request for a summoner name swap, you will be required to verify ownership of both accounts and still have to pay the cost of a name change.","replies":[]}]}
