I used offensive language in the chat but we were a 5 man team I dont understand why Riot perma banned me for playing around with my friends. I Didnt feed either and I was playing the game right. I may have used offensive language but my friends didnt really care and one of them reported me just for the jokes and got perma banned. I dont think I deserve the punisent of getting permanently banned. I have also spent some money on this account and It would be very sad if it just turned into dust. I hope you get this message and consider to unban me. \r\n\r\nYours Sincerely,\r\n\r\nKOB34LLDAY","replies":[{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2018-06-15T10:18:18.403+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"If you want to appeal your punishment you can send a ticket to player support: https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/requests/new\n\nAs for the likelihood of that helping, or any community feedback, we can't tell you anything specific or not readily available without knowing why you were punished. I'd recommend posting your reform card or at least the chat logs, and whether or not you've had any previous punishments. Without that info we can't tell you much.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Jeneral Pain","date":"2018-06-15T07:44:16.302+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You would be better off logging a support case to plead out your permanent ban.\n\nFor you to be escalated to a permanent ban, it either was significantly poor behaviour, or you've exhibited a pattern of poor behaviour resulting in you reaching the final stage \"life ban\".\n\nYou chose to be silly... regardless of your friends being \"silly\" with the ban, it was obviously significantly serious.","replies":[]}]}
