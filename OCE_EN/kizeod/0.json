Most people who AFK do it during the mid - late game, for various reasons, and very rarely do they AFK during the first few minutes of a game. Quite frankly, its a waste of time.\n\nOften I find remakes taking up around 10-12 minutes of time , and it&#039;s very annoying that I&#039;m not compensated for this. Trying to get level 30 on this account is already a trek as it is, and the frequent remakes every 3 or so games are quite annoying.\n\nOf course, I&#039;m not asking Riot compensate us with copious amounts of XP every remake, but it would be nice to receive 20 or 30 XP so I know that all that time wasted wasn&#039;t for nothing.","replies":[{"poster":"Krispy Migraine","date":"2018-04-27T23:38:01.270+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"yes","replies":[]}]}
