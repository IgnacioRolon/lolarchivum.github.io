It used to be a very much \"use at your own risk\" situation, however that is no longer the case. Riot announced sometime around the start of the year (if memory serves) that they would be changing 3rd party software punishments to cover everything, rather than just the stuff that give an unfair advantage, because it becomes extremely difficult to differentiate between the two.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Akkordian Zoeve","date":"2017-08-22T10:35:22.332+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hiya :)\n\nI asked Riot this about a month or so ago, since I'd seen loads of Streamers and YTers use them, and here is what they had to say:\n\n > Indeed 3rd party applications are against our Terms of Use but when it comes to Custom Skins it's a bit tricky. We don't ban accounts for using custom skins but you cannot control what the maker of this app will introduce in the app's code and our system might detect it as a punishable 3rd party application.\n\n > In other words, we don't ban you for using it but we don't recommend you to use it either.\n\nSo, basically, Custom Skins are perfectly alright, but the programs used to apply the Custom Skin *may* have some dodgy code you are unaware of that could get you banned.\n\nI would also look out for skins that provide an unfair advantage (definitely against Riot's ToS), like invisible particles or intentional bugs that can be exploited (think something like the Xerath bug, but with a skin). An example from WoW was one that changed the skins of all these ultra rare, expensive, and impossible-to-find objects to giant elemental pillars (or something).\n\nI hope this helps :)\n\nThanks :D\n{{sticker:slayer-jinx-wink}}","replies":[]},{"poster":"BarryButcher","date":"2017-08-22T10:00:04.829+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"http://s2.quickmeme.com/img/12/12df412d8f82f89b0164425bd96ae484b802ea18f47fa9348ca04e0ea2961023.jpg","replies":[]}]}
