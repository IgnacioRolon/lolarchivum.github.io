We've been collecting photos of cosplayers across Australia to collage together a huge thank you card from *everyone* you've inspired, helped out, and supported along the way. Whilst this is obviously a thank you to every Rioter out there, there's a few we need to single out to thank personally. \n\nTo Riot Achenar, (who is an absolute superstar in maintaining her role as our fairy cosmother) and Riot Crucius, for handling all 170+ League cosplayers at PAX and making sure the show ran smoothly, and ensuring our cosplay swag was delivered to the hundreds of League cosplayers across Australia, New Zealand and probably a few over the rest of the world too. Thank you! We hope this small token of our appreciation is a thank you enough for all the incredible work you've done. \n\n(I'd also like to personally thank Riot Achenar for convincing me I was not going to fall down the stage steps when I had to go up there blind, and still ended up falling down them.)\n\n[If this doesn't open properly, hit the three dots in the lower right and 'View Original'.](https://www.dropbox.com/s/pf32q04fnzdxdig/card.png?dl=0\n)","replies":[{"poster":"MasterMirkinen","date":"2015-02-12T08:54:52.714+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"Just WOW!!!
