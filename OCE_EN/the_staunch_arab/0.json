The reason the account was suspended was for scripting - He has never scripted before, has no knowledge of scripting, and has only played on his account himself so there is no possible chance of someone else using a script on his account. He has tried to appeal it but got pushed back, saying that they obviously cannot release the evidence as it may affect future investigations, which makes complete sense.\r\n\r\nI can 100% guarantee that he has never used scripts, he is currently in bronze 2 and has worked hard to get there from bronze 5. I feel it is highly unfair as he has put a lot of time and effort into this account, it was unfairly banned and his appeals were rejected even though he was innocent.\r\n\r\nCan someone from Riot please look into this further? As we all know we can tend to get attached to things, and league is no exclusion - i can see that my friend is both unhappy &amp; disappointed as he feels as if the past 2 years were just a waste of time. I will vouch for him and can guarantee that he has not scripted, used any 3rd party applications at all (not even any recording software).\r\n\r\nHis IGN is SuperKolz.\r\n\r\nAny help you can offer in this situation would be much appreciated.\r\n\r\nThanks in advance,\r\n\r\nThe Staunch Arab","replies":[{"poster":"SephirothSG","date":"2016-04-14T08:19:52.137+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey there,\n\nYour friends best option is to [submit a support ticket](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/requests/new) to have the ban reviewed, however these bans are not given out unless there is 100% confidence in the offence.\n\nIt's possible the account may have been compromised and the person who compromised the account used disallowed third party software, however that is up to support to investigate.","replies":[]}]}
