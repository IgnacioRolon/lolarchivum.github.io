Im assuming its when lots of people are using the internet and cant cope with it, but still only with league.\nI havnt rang telecom up, dont know if i could not being the owner.\nAnd apologies for my out burst up there, was playing a few games and got very salty o.O, something im working on improving since playing again after a year.\nthanks for your help, appreciate it.","replies":[{"poster":"HORSE OF FORCE","date":"2015-06-20T02:53:28.571+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I wouldn't call that an outburst at all, at least compared to what I've seen people regard as \"a normal reaction\".\n\n*Have* you tried using another DNS yet?","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"0wen","date":"2015-06-19T14:09:17.923+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I think its just having so many people connected at once.
