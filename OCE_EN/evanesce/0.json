I remember last night it was 8 and then when the game started it was 8.40. Too many people dodge. Too mnay people don&#039;t accept q&#039;s.  Now, i started queuing up at 7.50 now is 8.20 and i still don&#039;t have  a queue.  The average wait for a match is around 30 minutes usually, it&#039;sso fucking fustrating. I&#039;m not sure if im the only one but im always in queue with the same people and they all too get pissed and tilted. \n\nAnd a game i played a few games ago someone was complaining because they neever get their position. So this thing is getting fucked up really..\n\nSorry for swearing just really pissed and GAMES NEVER START.\n\nDoes this happen to others??","replies":[{"poster":"andypandy","date":"2016-02-05T23:40:02.000+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"its fucking shit, ive waited for 25 mins now just 4 a ranked, riot needs to fix this, im not waiting that long to have a game of lol","replies":[]},{"poster":"Z3npachi","date":"2016-02-05T22:06:27.246+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You can thank dynamic que.
