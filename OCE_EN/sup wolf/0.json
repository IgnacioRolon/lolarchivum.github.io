WTF was that mean Riot you noob GM.

I warded up the riverside and clearly their jungler and ap were groupings to come counter me so that I pinged for help because I sense that so I already farm so deep in my jungle area and I call bot lane to come for backup because at the time karma was  b and he walks near me, but he won't answer me. Then it's fine I ping for help and I do the vision and no one help so I died. The thing that makes me angry is the bot lane suddenly started to ping my dead then, of course, I think every one of you must fight back because you already ping for help and no one came and they just blame you. And as I remember that sup and ap were duos so that they never came to cover me while I was getting counter jungle. So I felt so sad to this server, players were toxic, never playing with teamwork and just care about their kda so they never improve and they made old players like me lost the passion on this game anymore. I know my English was not that good but hope you guys understand, I was not judging oce player's skills but I want to say is if they didn't know how to teamwork in the game then don't come to play rank and troll because I really treat the game so serious.","replies":[{"poster":"TheDemonEmperor","date":"2019-05-01T08:49:41.382+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> This first thing is they were duo and I was getting my jungle resources in my own area.

If they don't, then why do you insist on making that play? Learn some advance tips for the role, and learn to do \"vertical jungling\" instead.\n\n> So I felt so sad to this server, players were toxic, never playing with teamwork and just care about their kda so they never improve and they made old players like me lost the passion on this game anymore.\n\nOh, don't give me that crap.
