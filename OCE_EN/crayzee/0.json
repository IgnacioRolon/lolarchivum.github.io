That's why it took so long for me to finally backtrack and find this.\n\nI'm very sorry that Riot Support haven't gotten back to you on this. When I presented them with a situation that was clearly a fault with the game's coding not gracefully devolving, they just said, \"We've sent this to our tech guys. They'll get in touch with you soon.\" And they never did.\n\nHave you tried waiting for over five minutes after you clicked the button, while in admin mode? Maybe it just needs to cache something, in which case waiting once will fix it forever (or at least, until it's deleted again).\n\nHave you tried running the program in compatibility mode? If you're on Windows 8, try compatibility for Windows 7 (latest service pack), and then XP (latest service pack). There's no point in trying the others.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Crayzee","date":"2015-05-06T00:33:48.122+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"i ticket being open for a week, with little to no help, thats baaaad","replies":[]},{"poster":"Crayzee","date":"2015-05-05T13:25:08.108+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Still yet to get help from my ticket","replies":[]},{"poster":"Crayzee","date":"2015-05-05T13:24:44.050+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Still yet to get help from my ticket","replies":[]},{"poster":"Crayzee","date":"2015-05-01T23:03:25.895+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Riot doesn't seem to give a shit about technical problems","replies":[]},{"poster":"HORSE OF FORCE","date":"2015-05-01T09:35:03.369+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I know this will seem silly, but have you tried running in admin mode?","replies":[]},{"poster":"Azphreal","date":"2015-04-30T13:16:06.901+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Same issue.
