Not only was i the only human in a human Vs AI match, but the bots matched up in the ally team was consistently feeding the opponent side. If the server is unable to find human players, might as well not push such entities into the play for the sake of keeping ppl occupied. Maybe its not an issue for most, but i play a game for satisfaction and if this carries on upstarts like me will definitely drop out and hence the decline of this game. \r\n\r\nThis could have been avoided if the gaming universe can find players or accounts that uses scripts to gain points. We cannot report every single anomaly. I would have already reported 100+ accounts. I suggest that you value this feedback for the best of interests.","replies":[{"poster":"SephirothSG","date":"2016-10-12T09:34:31.978+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey there,\n\nSeems to me like you're misinformed.\n\nThe game doesn't intentionally place bot players onto your team, these \"bot players\" you're referring to are usually people automating the levelling of their accounts through the use of disallowed third party software, this is obviously **NOT** allowed and as such is reportable, please report these players in the post-game lobby when you encounter them.","replies":[]}]}
