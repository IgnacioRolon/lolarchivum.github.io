Now, here&#039;s the part I&#039;m not cool about, being decayed down from Plat 5 to Gold 1 in that three days when my last ranked game was a win on top of that. \n\nOf course I&#039;m unsure how I can prove to the general populace that I was indeed Platinum 5 before this outage, so I&#039;m unsure how much, if any, sympathy I can garner. But to those working at riot, surely this can be fixed, right? I was well within that &#039;28 day&#039; decay wait timer, and I wasn&#039;t on 0LP in Plat 5. I couldn&#039;t in good conscience try and play a game in that time, and risking not being able to connect for my team&#039;s sake?","replies":[{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2018-05-06T07:33:57.517+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Submit a ticket to Player Support. They may not be able to fix your rank (changing ranks/LP does significant damage to LP gains and MMR behind the scenes, you'd be worse off for it, support can also give you a more detailed explanation of this) but they should be able to tell you what's going on and how to prevent it in future.\n\nhttps://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/requests/new\n\nPlease be aware that the login for the support page and the website (boards) are seperate. \nhttps://i.imgur.com/IrSBuzi.png?noredirect\n\nThere are currently issues with the login transition preventing players from easily logging into support. There are two current workarounds:\n\n1. Open the support page in an incognito/private window and follow the process as normal, pressing the login button when prompted.\n\n2. Log out of the website **from the support page**, and then follow the process as normal, pressing login when prompted.\n\nIf your support page has the blank \"OC\" login in the top right, you're good to go. If it only has your summoner icon with \"OCEANIA\" it means the support page is seeing you as logged in on the website and not in support. You need to follow one of the steps above.","replies":[]}]}
