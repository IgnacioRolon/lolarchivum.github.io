Highest graphics, no hitches, delays or anything of the sort. However recently that&#039;s all gone down the shitter. Spells will take almost a second to show up on my screen. They&#039;ll have happened, but the game&#039;s reaction, visibly, will be delayed by up to a whole second. People have been able to walk from the bushes into my mid lane without them appearing until they&#039;re on top of me. \r\n\r\nI&#039;ve turned down the graphics to literally as low as it will go, even frame capping, but nothing seems to work! League also seems to be the only game I&#039;m having this problem on.\r\n\r\nAnyone got any ideas what&#039;s happening to me?","replies":[{"poster":"SephirothSG","date":"2017-09-21T10:21:14.920+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey there,\n\nSounds like packet loss to me, could you please do the following.\n\n* [Switch to a public DNS](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues#wq5)\n* [Download WinMTR](https://sourceforge.net/projects/winmtr/files/WinMTR-v092.zip/download) and run a traceroute to the following IP.
