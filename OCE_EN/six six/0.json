(like the Arcade Hecarim)\r\n\r\n- {{champion:150}}  Gnar is lacking in the love in the skin department. Seen as the poor lil fella only has one skin, why not make him a transformer? like he does transform no? why not a mecha or battlecast? \r\n\r\n- {{champion:55}}  Katarina why not give the spinning girl a ballet skin as all she seems to do is spin, plus it rhymes ballerina katarina..\r\n\r\n- {{champion:38}}  Kassadin he is the sneaky sort, why not throw him in with Shen and the other assassins? I mean he is known to some at Kassassin.\r\n\r\n- {{champion:154}}  Zac I think needs more colours (like Xerath) or even light the dude on fire and make him lava zac seen as he does melt into a puddle and reform then maybe a volcano on reformation? \r\n\r\n- {{champion:133}}  Freedom Day Quin because Freedom baby! (#&#039;merica) she has the eagle XD\r\n\r\nAnd why not do a UN group pack like have a bunch of Champs from different countries? players vote on the champion for each voted country?","replies":[{"poster":"Essembie","date":"2015-04-26T09:44:48.182+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Lol rainbow xerath - UNLEASH THE GOOD!","replies":[{"poster":"Six Six","date":"2015-07-01T23:46:27.404+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Exactly, would be fabulous haha","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"BarryButcher","date":"2015-04-26T06:54:47.696+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Im thinking more along the lines of, how the hell are Xerath's skin going to be different when the Chromas come out...","replies":[]},{"poster":"Ritual","date":"2015-04-26T06:52:20.874+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"super gnar","replies":[]},{"poster":"HunnyLin","date":"2015-04-11T00:32:22.519+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey just wondering because i think a mecha Nasus{{champion:75}} will be absolutely awesome","replies":[{"poster":"Six Six","date":"2015-04-13T08:47:25.209+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"yeah agreed, that or a battle cast :)","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"TheFappening69","date":"2015-04-11T05:33:45.863+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I actually think a Void Gnar would be awesome.
