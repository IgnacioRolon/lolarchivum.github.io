I can not think of a melee champion that would win him. He is, there is no tank who scales as ridiculously as him. His sheer damage and tankiness, i honestly cannot deal with him. Another is basically Mundo, i thought shen was bad, if you dont kill him 3 times early game pre 6 its basically over when he gets some health and armor.\r\n\r\nAlso, tryndamere does not work at all in top anymore, he gets stomped, im not sure why, might have to do with that thunderlord mastery. But something needs to be done about these points ive made. Im presuming people are having issues with mundo and tahm in top as well/\r\nDo i really need to be quinn or teemo or basically a bastard with gnar in order to win against them? IF you even win that is","replies":[{"poster":"Omni Presents","date":"2016-01-02T14:20:31.514+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The current meta is out the window, with this new patch 5.2 we need to rethink who to play and how to build, it has turned 180 very fast.\n\nAs for the answer to your question, what champions in top lane are currently winning the most? That would be your answer.\n\nThis http://champion.gg/statistics/#?sortBy=general.winPercent&order=descend&roleSort=Top is a good chart to look at, it shows Tahm at 10th, yet if you are having issues against him, than maybe you need to pick him and learn to play, this will give you the information needed to learn to beat him since each time you lose, you learn how and why and learn to counter build.","replies":[]},{"poster":"JasonWazza","date":"2016-01-02T09:59:14.679+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":">Im presuming people are having issues with mundo and tahm in top as well/\n\nI mean, they are kinda 2 of the top 3 bans.\n\nEDIT: cause i'm not in game yet i will say this, trynd isn't meta, he isn't the type of snowbally this meta needs, as he doesn't snowball and then teamfight, he snowballs then splitpushes.","replies":[]},{"poster":"CHEESYLEEKS","date":"2016-01-02T11:54:39.556+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"{{champion:6}} - i vsed tahm not long back and sustained lane rather easy,mundo is tricky but do-able, you just need your jungler on board before he snowballs and gets that mad regen. play him right and all the other common melee picks are not very difficult. hes pretty good at shifting into carry support mid-late game also. the person i always have a problem with is illaoi, tentacles do 10x more dam than the actual champ.\n\nhe has his problems but learn to stamp them and he can be a very viable and diverse top.\n\nbit of food for thought. probably gonna get flamed for this post but idc.","replies":[]}]}
