I have checked to ensure it is in the correct file specified, however it will not launch. It once showed a little window and then closed almost immediately before I could read what it says and it doesn&#039;t appear as running in task manager.I have also tried to uninstall it however the uninstall also doesn't load so I have tried deleting the files and also just reinstalling again but no success\n\n**SOLUTION FOUND (located in give link)** \nfound this and followed it and it seemed to work perfectly for me! If you're a fellow MSI user having trouble with the alpha client [this](http://boards.euw.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/alpha-client-discussion-en/pqlTBA3G-alpha-client-startup-issues) may be a potential solution.
