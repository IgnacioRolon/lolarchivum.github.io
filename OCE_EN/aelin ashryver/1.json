I am using a Macbook Pro with El Capitan OS completely up to date. I have been unable to login since the last patch, I have tried every bit of trouble shooting on the website, yet every single time I go to login I get this error:\r\n\r\nConnection failure: Unable to connect to the PVP.net server. Information regarding what may have caused this error can be found here. \r\n\r\nFirst issue, the link in &#039;here&#039; doesn&#039;t work, so I am guessing it is just a link to the trouble shooting pages. But of course the biggest issue is not being able to log into the game. \r\n\r\nIs anyone else having this issue? Were you able to fix it?\r\n\r\nAny help would be appreciated.","replies":[{"poster":"SephirothSG","date":"2016-03-10T08:30:56.310+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey there,\n\nSounds like a DNS issue to me considering you're unable to load the support page.\n\nCould you try the following for me and let me know if that resolves the issue.\n\n\n> CHANGING TO PUBLIC DNS\n> \n> * Open System Preferences\n> * Open the Network preference pane\n> * Select the active connection on the left, and click the \"Advanced...\" button in the lower right hand corner\n> * Click \"DNS\" from the selection bar.\n> * Remove any current DNS entries, and input the following public DNS servers:\n> \n>  **8.8.8.8**\n>  **8.8.4.4**\n> \n> * Save your changes by selecting \"OK\"\n> * Apply the changes by clicking \"Apply\" in the lower right hand corner\n>","replies":[{"poster":"Aelin Ashryver","date":"2016-03-10T12:18:55.245+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thanks for your response. I have already tried this when I followed all the trouble shooting instructions, however I attempted it again. I feel like it is something wrong with my client, because as a test I tried to log in with my sister's account and had the same issue.\n\nDo you have any other suggestions? I had no problems prior to the last patch, which makes me feel like it is a problem with the actual client. I have repaired, uninstalled and reinstalled the client with no success.","replies":[{"poster":"SephirothSG","date":"2016-03-12T03:43:51.135+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"If you're having issues accessing the support site then it is more than likely a DNS related issue.\n\nCould you please run the [ICSI netalyzr](http://netalyzr.icsi.berkeley.edu/) and post back with a link to your results (Copy the URL you're taken to when the test is finished)","replies":[]}]}]}]}
