Anyone else experienced this problem? Seriously what is going on with this game? Don&#039;t we pay Riot enough money for them not to have these random issues ?","replies":[{"poster":"Lord Sesshomaru","date":"2017-05-15T05:27:50.570+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Technically we don't pay them anything to play the game, so in theory they don't HAVE to do anything for us. :P\n\nI haven't had the problem you mentioned, but I have noticed that settings are computer-specific. Item sets, chat filters, smart casting, even status messages change when you switch computers. So if you had played on multiple computers and adjusted the settings on each, its possible that you settings still exist on the other computer.\n\nWhat settings are you talking about specifically?\nMany settings _(minus item sets)_ should are fairly easy to re-make.","replies":[{"poster":"Pycckuu Ak47","date":"2017-05-15T06:12:46.056+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"True, so in the year 2014 for example, $1.6 billion must have been donated ;)\nAnd I am talking about all the settings in general were reset and no I haven't played on any other computer.","replies":[]}]}]}
