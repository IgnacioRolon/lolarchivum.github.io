Your client may say that you called first but it has to register through others so I think it might have to be your Internet speed that processes everything. It's like a Skype message. If you're next to your friend and you're on Skype and he's on Skype and he sends you a message, it's instant for him but it takes a second or so for you to be able to see it.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Contrakt","date":"2014-12-04T08:28:20.859+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Just let them take it.
