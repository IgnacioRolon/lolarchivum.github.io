I&#039;m just really curious about how can someone have bold and italics as a name but only in chat, champ select and in-game he had a normal name like everyone else, it was only after the game.\r\n\r\nThanks for reading and hopefully helping me out\r\n~Rexisea {{champion:17}}","replies":[{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2017-04-24T11:21:00.763+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"/me command.
