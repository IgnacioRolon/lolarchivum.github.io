We were all on Skype for easier communication and I heard my friend being very confused at the fact of Tryndamere being able to see (and attack) Wukong while he activated his W (which makes him drop a clone of himself and walk away from it invisible). I was very puzzled about this because that doesn&#039;t seem fair or right, so I went on replay.gg to find the replay, watched it over and found a clip of it (attached link). My friend and I went in to a private game to test out theories: Tryndamere&#039;s W (Mocking Shout) does not give vision of invisible units and neither does ignite. Both of these factors along with use of pink wards and other vision items were tested multiple times and we are still confused with this situation. The tests we conducted concluded that when auto attack was enabled or disabled there were a few milliseconds where Tryndamere followed the invisible Wukong or continued to attack Wukong if he was nearby. The video shows that Tryndamere had no assisted vision (pink wards, sweeping trinkets etc) and yet still continued to attack and kill Wukong, I enabled only blue side vision (enemy team) and fog of war was enabled. This problem happened multiple times and although it wasn&#039;t me experiencing these problems I still believe this is very weird and unfair. \r\nRito please fix\r\n~Rexisea {{champion:17}}","replies":[{"poster":"dragon poo","date":"2016-10-29T11:23:03.160+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"im pretty sure an ignited target grants vision on the target.","replies":[{"poster":"Nightjar","date":"2016-10-29T12:00:32.638+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"as someone who plays alot of shaco, no it does not. Ignite reveals you in the fog of war, but if you stealth you stay invisible. That wukong thing was a bug, though if tryndamere was mid-aa when wukong stealthed than you'll still be hit, ie if I shaco q away from a vayne, the silver bolt can still pin me to a wall.","replies":[]}]}]}
