I&#039;m not saying they should make exact copies of some of the older skins, it&#039;s just that some of them occupy an extremely cool theme that a champ can display but will never have except for the ones who were lucky enough to be OG. I think they should reimagine some of those skins and release them to the public, maybe release similarly styled skins that are throwbacks to those old skins, like pax tf, pax jax, pax sivir and riot singed. You know a jax that has the same weapon and hat but a different style of outfit, (imo) pax tf is kinda lame I don&#039;t really see his theme translating into anything else, but pax sivir is basically a project sivir skin, and riot singed is basically just a modern singed, but these champ themes are locked away, I&#039;m not saying that they should be released and screw their old fans I&#039;m just saying I want a jax skin \nthat has a conical hat and bo :) and a singed skin that gives him a modern Frontline suppression unit theme. \n{{sticker:slayer-pantheon-thumbs}}\n\n\n\n\nEdit: pax Jax has a cardboard tube, so maybe instead of that give him a tree branch, wooden table \nleg, something like that. Just to be clear these wouldn't be replicas, they would be unique skins that copy some similar themes, for example Jax has a conical hat with a ornament on it and a different color scheme, singed gets updated riot gear which is different to the original, thanks like that, not gigantic changes, but enough to make them unique and also occupy a SIMILAR theme, that way you \ncan enjoy those styles of the champion without ruining the authenticity of the originals. It would devalue the originals, but they have no value except the exclusivity, they would still be exclusive and people would still go wow, it's just that they have cool concepts that got locked away.

So because of real-world restraints _(e.g. Creating and distributing a Pip-Boy to every single fall-out player, would make the game a catastrophic money drain for the companies involved.)_ it's understandable that physical objects would be limited and only return on special occasions _(if at all)_. \n\nBut when your 'limited edition' is a line of computer code...\n(that technically is already sitting in our computers taking up space) and the only reason we don't have it is because someone hasn't flicked a switch. Well.. thats just a little pathetic. \nIts false limited, not truly limited. \n\n______\n\nI don't know much about Excalibur Prime, but my biggest beef is with Nintendo and Pokemon for this though. \n\nthere have been 24 Pokemon games over the last 20 years _(including the classics we all know and love)_. \nMew, one of the oldest, most iconic, and most loved _(ranked 3rd favourite (out of now 802) in Japan last year)_ Pokemon _(and my personal favourite)_, has never, repeat never, been available to catch, in any game...\n\n24 games... 20 years... No Mew. Ever.\n\nThe only way to legally obtain one is to receive a gift from Nintendo, and only in certain events. Most of which of course, exclusively in Japan _(far from here! too far to warrant a trip just to get an 8 bit digital animal.)_. \n\nThey give out Mew for free, (you've never had to pay for it), so they make little money off it. \nAlmost everyone In our generation grew up with Pokemon, and sat as kids watching the epic battle between Mew and Mewtwo, so everyone wants it, because its a piece of their childhood. \n\nThere is actually no reason to withhold the Pokemon from the game. They cant make much money off printing thousands of codes and giving them out for free, and all it does is make people unlucky enough not to have a several thousand dollar trip to japan, hack the game and distribute illegal copies of it _(which helps no one, especially not Nintendo.)_\n\nI know its only Pokemon and not fancy e-sports games like League or Overwatch.\nBut it doesn't matter what the game is, It's this pointless withholding of content that pisses me off.\n\n_____\n\nEventually, most _(if not all)_ of the people who own the Pax skins etc etc, Won't even be playing anymore _(or slowly, more and more accounts get banned for various reasons_), and soon enough the skins will essentially be extinct from the game, and Riot will probably have to bring them back anyway.\nSo theres little point in pretending that they will be 'limited' forever, and if you know they're not going to be limited forever, then why not just bring them back already?\n\nPS. Nice job on getting those collectibles though! :P \nMy brother is pretty annoyed that he couldn't afford the Pip-Boy. \nApparently people are 3D printing them now though?","replies":[{"poster":"Klavinmour","date":"2017-02-11T12:28:10.622+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Eh I don't much understand the salt on the Mew issue, the Wifi/Internet events happen quite regularly, and two years ago there was one that gave out Mew for free internationally and that event went for just over a month.\nYou just connect to Mystery Gift via the internet and bob's your uncle.\n\n-------------------------\nIf you really want one...\nhttps://www.twitch.tv/pokemoncenter\nThese guys occasionally do give aways and let you \"order\" a pokemon from them.\n--------------------------\n\nAnd you'd be surprised, there actually is quite the E-Sport following for Pokemon, especially because it can have just as, if not more strategy and skill involved than LoL at some points.\n\n\n---------------------------------------\n\nPersonally I accept Digital Exclusive items fairly easily, it might have something to do with the YEARS I poured into TF2 and it's micro transactions, to which I now have quite the collection of Unusual Hats.\n(You can never have enough by the way)\n\nI also see it as really the only option companies will have soon for generating hype and revenue.\nPeople bitch about pre-order incentives, but what else are game devs meant to do?\nThe price of games hasn't changed in over 30 years, not even for inflation.\nIt's getting more and more expensive to make games, Devs need extra cash.\n\nDigital hype generating exclusives create this.

Its hardly fair to people who like Yasuo, and there'd be a ton of people who unknowingly miss out. \n\nThere are some people who want to just play the game, and don't want to have to jump through hoops just to get a Pokemon that was made 20 years ago. They give you a Pokedex in the game and tell you to catch every Pokemon, then they say: \n\"Ohhh but Pokemon like Celebi and Mew, you cant actually get, even though you need them for the Pokedex... sorry about that, wait a couple of years from now until your game is outdated, and we might think about giving it out.\"\nAnd now they have stopped giving codes out for older games altogether. So if youre taking a trip down memory lane and playing one of the classics like Red or Blue, or even one of the remakes like Soulsilver and Heartgold _(arguably one of the best releases of pokemon)_ its physically impossible to get Mew or Celebi or a whole trove of other pokemon. \n\nI have a beef with games that wont let you finish them because theres something being withheld.

So unless you pre-ordered the game, its **literally** impossible to finish it...\n\nYea I know that Pokemon gets quite competitive and remarkably strategic, Ive got a nice Milotic that my team centres around (I'm not competitive in it though, even though my team would probably do alright, i just battle for fun :P).

So seeming all the limited skins have already lost their credibility as being limited, its time to just bite the bullet, and bring them back, give 90% of the population what they want. \n\nThen the people at Riot can trade their 'limited' computer code in, for real limited Ferrari's and Rolexes. \n\nI do think that its incredibly selfish for such cool concepts like Riot Singed, and Urf the Manatee, to be basically absent from the game, just so a few people _(who often don't even play the skins)_ can feel 'special'.","replies":[{"poster":"Mal 0wns","date":"2017-02-17T03:48:54.941+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hi, do you own any of these skins?","replies":[]},{"poster":"Klavinmour","date":"2017-02-10T06:33:31.869+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Making something limited creates a demand for it however.\nSupply and demand make things more wanted.\nTake a look at amiibos for instance, artificial supply limits make them crazy hot to sell, not to mention it's nigh impossible to get officially licensed Nintendo figurines outside of Japan, or third party craftsmen.\n\nNot to mention that some of these skins are limited for a reason as they were rewards for certain things.\n\nFor instance I would be pissed if people could suddenly get Silver Kayle a skin that was a reward for BUYING THE PHYSICAL EDITION OF THE GAME.","replies":[{"poster":"Mal 0wns","date":"2017-02-16T11:38:19.323+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Do you own those original skins?","replies":[{"poster":"Klavinmour","date":"2017-02-16T15:12:28.394+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yes, I have Silver Kayle, PAX Sivir and PAX Jax.","replies":[{"poster":"Mal 0wns","date":"2017-02-17T03:47:47.928+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Makes sense you so vehemently defend the quality and limit nature of the skins. Im not saying thats a bad thing, and i certainly believe they shouldnt rerelease silver kayle or black alistar. Whether or not they a re good or bad quality. Those were preorders you expect them to have their own status above other limited skins.\n\nBut wouldnt you like to get a twisted fate skin that had similar references, im not saying releas the same skin, but maybe make a new one with updated references and a new overall theme. Wouldnt you like that type of thing? Say if u were a tf main who enjoyed those references made by the original skin, but couldnt get it because they werent in the right place at the right time. It woulnt be the exct same skin but it would satisfy the newer players without ruining the limited status of the originals. Plus as a bonus they would probably update those old skins at the same time to appease their old fans, its a win-win, your skin gets updated and we get a homage to the birth of one of the most popular games out there and popular references of those years.\n","replies":[]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Klavinmour","date":"2017-02-09T22:25:59.669+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You do realise that PAX Jax doesn't have a bo.\nThat is a cardboard tube.\nThe skin is based off of the Cardboard Sammurai from Penny Arcade's comics.

They are basically chromas. There are much more interesting and unique skin designs. The point isn't to release the old skins again, it's to use similar themes to create entirely (or mostly) new skins. Black alistar and silver kyle lack their own individuality.
