We&#039;ve got games, RP, and a bunch of other stuff to give away! Also, some of the OPL players including (but not limited to) Chief Swiffer, LCG Joo, LCG Tallywhacka, iM Zenk intel, and ABS Mattress are going to be there, and the person who donates the most will win a 1 hour coaching session with one of them!\r\n\r\nSo what are you waiting for? Head down to [the stream](http://twitch.tv/qquinn) and come check it out. Oh and remember - No Sejuani\r\n\r\nThanks,\r\nQUlNN","replies":[{"poster":"JasonWazza","date":"2015-05-30T02:00:23.523+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":">charity stream\n\n>and the person who donates the most will win a 1 hour coaching session with one of them!\n\nI believe you mean charity auction.","replies":[]}]}
