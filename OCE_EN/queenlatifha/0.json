When the top laner xin is 10 and 1 leagues ahead of everybody else or when someone just decides to afk randomly its just painful i&#039;d rather just surrender and start a new game. I do think if we had a 10 minutes surrender it would make the whole experience of loosing more pleasant and maybe even make people less toxic. Rito plz at the least consider this i strongly believe it would make league a slightly better experience.","replies":[{"poster":"fattyhotdogs","date":"2016-10-20T08:41:43.018+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It doesn't matter who has the early lead if you can hold on and push the game out to the point when everyone has their full build. \nWhen the xin inevitably reaches that point first, the enemy team is receiving diminished returns and you will begin to catch up","replies":[]},{"poster":"Wess","date":"2016-10-20T07:44:47.609+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The longer the game goes on, the less it matters if you lost lane.
