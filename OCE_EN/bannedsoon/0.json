Got muted for asking a tilted teammate what was wrong","subforum":"Player Behaviour","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Please note, this is on a weekend as is only in Silver IV &quot;ELO&quot; so I doubt anyone will care about the Silver trash shenanigans, but its annoying that I get a chat mute for being polite when Riot&#039;s chat filters allow a scumbag to keep going. I need to rant.\n\nWe all know that unless you&#039;re high level, the community of League itself is bad enough, but from social commentary and my own experience, the Oceania server is far more notorious for trolls/AFKers/griefers etc - and today was no different. We had a Warwick jungle who decided to run it down mid after being told he got &quot;clapped&quot; in a team fight at the 10 minute mark. Suprisingly nothing else was said, but the Warwick decided that was enough of a bad deed for him to feed the enemy team.  He was 2/0/1 by 10 minutes in, he was playing really really well - but within 10 minutes he was 2/10/1. \n\nAlas, this is League of Legends after all, and a 4v5 is nothing new - so we kept playing with our intentional feeder, with the hope of carrying him. 5 minutes later, he&#039;s still intentionally feeding, and because of it, the rest of my team are now abusing the Warwick instead of playing the game out. He got told he was sh*t, bad, a noob. etc. As well as multiple times to kill himself. Negative comments that will tilt any already negative person even further - and lucky for me and my placement matches, caused him to feed more - because why not right? Riot arent going to do anything unless they&#039;re scripting or not buying RP often enough. \n\nA bit sick and tired of the toxic team typing all game instead of playing, I ask the Warwick why he let ONE comment (the &#039;clapped&#039; comment) ruin his own game, and asked him if anything else had gone wrong that day to cause it?  This game is very depressing at times, and I can understand if he was feeling a bit down - I wanted to make sure he was okay. I added the player afterward (IGN - &quot;[ REMOVED - [Reporting Other Players](http://boards.oce.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/announcements/BjArMH2B-boards-universal-rules) ]&quot;) to ask him if everything was okay. The community LoL has is very toxic, and with another player telling this kid to kill himself, I wanted to make sure he was all good as I have had other friends kill themselves due to negative online behaviour and if a small comment can change that, I can only try. \n\nIn response, I got racially abused, told to kill myself, and that if he was in my next game he would ensure I lost again. He then blocked me -- maybe just a troll, maybe an upset kid, I don&#039;t know - but the block made me feel a bit better.....until low and behold, the next game I&#039;m queued up with the Warwick again. Not only did he abuse the team (of all new players this time) in the champion select\n\nI typically play in 5 man pre-mades and we all use Discord, so very few messages get sent in game so I don&#039;t think it was a delayed mute?\n\nEither way, I can see why so many people have changed games- its just such a shame because the game is brilliant, but the community ruin everything!!!\n\nMake /muteall permanent! The pings you&#039;ve provided are suitable.","replies":[{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2018-09-21T10:47:33.942+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"It's likely your chat restriction was issued by the [Instant Feedback System](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/207489286-Instant-Feedback-System-FAQ-), which is automated and driven by player reports, though it is possible your case was manually reviewed instead or as well as.\n\nYou seem to be missing some of your post but I'll work with what I've got.\n\nYou mention time of day, rank and such, but none of that is relevant to behaviour. You mention the behaviour of another player, and while that may be relevant to your behaviour, it is irrelevant to the responsibility. The Warwick is responsible for his actions, and you are responsible for yours. Unless it was a very unusual false positive, you would not have been chat restricted for politely asking questions or trying to keep the game together. \n\nIf you want community feedback on a punishment or are unsure regarding why you were punished, I encourage you to post your chat logs here for players to review. \n\nIf you wish to appeal your punishment you can do so through [support](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/requests/new). Be aware support will only answer the question you ask. If you ask a yes or no question, you'll get a yes or no answer. Nor will support provide you with _any_ details pertaining to someone else's account, only your own.\n\nIn case you are unaware, Riot's policy on retaliation vs defence is that defending yourself is fine, but retaliation isn't. Once you break the rules, it doesn't matter if someone else 'started it':\n>WHY WAS I PUNISHED WHEN THE OTHER PERSON WAS WORSE OR STARTED IT!\n\n>Simply speaking, retaliation is not an acceptable or justifiable behavior. An argument between two players can easily create a negative experience for the rest of the players in the game with you. Regardless of the other playerâ€™s actions, this does not justify your own behavior. You alone are responsible for your actions within the game.If you encounter a toxic player like this, the best option is to simply report their behavior and move on.","replies":[{"poster":"BannedSoon","date":"2018-09-21T10:55:11.086+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"Hi Seras,\n\nThanks for your response - I guess you are right, there's no changing our teammates behaviour when they choose to throw a game.
