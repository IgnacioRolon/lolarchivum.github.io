A few days ago my mates and I played 3 Ranked 5 games and won them all while in promos yet we did not get promoted. An hour or 2 later Ranked 5&#039;s went down so I understand that there was a problem. Now that Ranked 5&#039;s are back up the wins we got we got are not updated on our ladder score. Any help or look would be greatly appreciated. Cheers.\n[17 wins 19 games](http://imgur.com/oHUb5Gj)\n[Last 3 wins to be promoted](http://imgur.com/t0TDiax)\n[Only 14 wins now and last games were losses](http://imgur.com/fCHiMDZ)\n\n**EDIT 1**\nOk just incase you need proof of the games that they exist here are the links\n[Game 1](http://matchhistory.oce.leagueoflegends.com/en/#match-details/OC1/105987256/208133702)\n[Game 2](http://matchhistory.oce.leagueoflegends.com/en/#match-details/OC1/106059514/208133702)\n[Game 3](http://matchhistory.oce.leagueoflegends.com/en/#match-details/OC1/106070266/208133702)\n\n**EDIT 2**\nWe submitted a ticket a few days ago, and got a response that we're fairly sure was automated, I'll post the link below. I just want this matter resolved whether we get the wins and get promoted or have the games not count and have to win another 3 in a row. It has nearly been 24 hours since posting this and I would greatly appreciate a response. Cheers.\n[Response to ticket](http://puu.sh/kvtjp/b769a4b4be.png)\n\n**EDIT 3**\n@Riot can you please respond to this? Is this the fault of your infamous spaghetti code? I would really love a response whether it is an email or responding to this post. Just want to know whats happening, and this post has been up for 2 days now. I understand it's the long weekend and world's is on, but I've seen Rioters comment on other posts. Cheers.\n\n**EDIT 4**\n@Riot as you did not reply or anything, can you at least remove and delete Xerath from League of Legends as he is the cost muntly champion there is.\n\n**EDIT 5**\nUnresolved","replies":[{"poster":"Wuks","date":"2018-07-04T06:44:51.706+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"To prevent further bumping of an old topic, I'll be closing this thread.
