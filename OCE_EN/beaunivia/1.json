{"poster":"Beaunivia","date":"2016-11-23T05:56:37.233+0000","title":"State of Anivia","subforum":"Gameplay & Strategy","up_votes":24,"down_votes":1,"body":"Just wanna start off by saying my credentials. I&#039;m currently a Diamond 2 mid laner who has mained Anivia since late season 1.\n\nLets go through a few changes that has happened to her from patch 5.24.\n**V 5.24** - Glacial Storm chill duration reduced to 1 second from 2 seconds and tether range decreased from 1200 to 1000.\n**V 6.9** - Flash Frost lost base damage at max rank from 180 to 160 and a AP ratio reduction from 0.5% to 0.4%. The stun length was also increased by .5 seconds at max rank.\n**V 6.19** - Frostbite lost base damage from 55-175 to 50-150.\n**V 6.23** - Frostbite has a reduced cooldown from 5 seconds to 4 seconds but now only procs the double damage on a full formed ultimate.\nLooking at her changes it really looks like Riot are decreasing her damage output significantly while making her utility more prominent.\n\n**Q - Flash Frost** : Base damage lowered, AP Ratio lowered, Stun length increased.\nThis is Anivia&#039;s hard crowd control ability. As the damage has been lowered it has hurt her laning phase slightly as she would not be able to make use of the extra .1 second stun. It&#039;s quite a slow spell, has a fairly high cooldown and the mana cost is quite high which means using wasting this spell means a good 12 seconds of having to play very passive and unable to trade efficiently. Late game when the damage wouldn&#039;t make too much of a difference the extra .5 seconds of aoe stun starts to finally shine.\n\n**W - Crystallize** : Cooldown lowered.\nAnivia&#039;s Trump card. The cooldown being lowered is very nice however it should of been lowered a long time ago since champions with escapes usually would be able to jump it twice before it came back off cooldown. The spell has a medium cast range which does mean you are putting yourself in a little bit of danger of being caught out and a bad wall can let a kill get away or give the enemy a pentakill. A very unique non-damaging spell that should be looked at more as there is a lot of potential then just &quot;A wall&quot;.\n\n**E - Frostbite** : Base damage lowered, Cooldown lowered, Only works with a fully formed Glacial Storm.\nThe main source of reliable damage in Anivia&#039;s kit. As this spell was usually maxed first, by level 9 you were losing 50 damage against a chilled target. The E-&gt;R combo was probably the biggest complaint people made when versing Anivia however, it was her form of trading during laning phase. Here is a list of some basic champion trades:\n{{champion:1}} Annie - Q-&gt;W\n{{champion:268}} Azir - W-&gt;Q (rest in peace Azir, say hi to Kalista for me)\n{{champion:69}} Cassiopeia - Q-&gt;E or W-&gt;E\n{{champion:61}} Orianna - Q-&gt;W\n{{champion:134}} Syndra - W-&gt;Q\nMost of these combos are very easy to land and are usually how the champion will trade. Anivia&#039;s trade-off for her combo was she had to wait til level 6 and her mana cost for her combo was higher. Anyway from V6.23, even though the cooldown has been reduced by 1 seconds, there is still a 1.5 second window you must wait before using Frostbite so in the previous patch you were able to get off 2 Frostbites dealing double damage faster then this patch unless you hit your Flash Frost.\n\n**R - Glacial Storm** : Initial damage lowered, Initial radius lowered, Tether range lowered, Removed attack speed slow, Full damage increased, Full slow increased.\nNeed a near infinite waveclear ability? The ability makes Anivia known as one of the best stallers in the game. The rework on Anivia made this ability grow from 200 to 400 cast size instead of just being an instant 400. This ability has quite a high mana cost without proper itemization and has been pushed towards being just a waveclearing ability since it takes time to proc the double damage from Frostbite. As Anivia needs a fair amount of mana sustain she will usually need to build a tear and a catalyst which means she will mostly rely on her base damage until about 20 minutes. As a champion that relies on base damage if the enemy laner builds a little bit of magic resist it becomes very hard to kill them, to the point where you might as well just farm hard and not even try to trade.\n\nThis brings me to one of my major points of Anivia being pushed towards a straight waveclearing bot. Trying to trade in lane now just feels like using too many resources of cooldowns and mana where as you could just farm. This is not fun gameplay when a champion benefits higher from PvE then PvP.\nAnivia has the lowest base health in the game and the lowest movement speed in the game (excluding Kled without Skaarl) coupled with no forms of escapes, no inbuilt sustain, high mana costs and now lower reliable damage has made her much much weaker during the laning phase.\nFor a champion to have such a high cost for full build to actually lose win rate% as the game goes on is not great either, no matter how long you can stall for the enemy mid laner will probably outscale you unless you have a teamcomp build around you or they have an early game champion.\nIn conclusion, she feels much weaker during the laning phase, is being pushed more for utility and waveclear and I don&#039;t feel Riot compensated enough to make her unique with any healthy changes.\n\nCheers for reading my rant and such, feel free to comment on how you feel she is, I really do want to know people&#039;s honest opinions on her after all the changes. She is currently sitting at a 42% win rate with a 2.69% play rate (op.gg), by going to today&#039;s stats as V6.23 only came out today. Last patch (V6.22) she was on 53.8% win rate with a 2.66% play rate (champion.gg).\n\n**Extra Content 23/11/16**\nAs most of the complaints that I&#039;ve read about Anivia is that she has a point and click ability that does so much damage so what I&#039;m going to do is list a bunch of champions with point and click abilities and explain the pros and cons. I&#039;ll refer to point and click abilities as PaCA.\n\n{{champion:34}}** Anivia - Frostbite** : 600 Range, 4 Cooldown, 50-90 Mana\nDamage : 50/75/100/125/150 + 50% AP\nTotal Damage : 100/150/200/250/300 + 100% AP\nThis ability on it&#039;s own does relatively low damage for the mana cost. Once an enemy has been chilled it will then deal double damage (100/150/200/250/300 + 100% AP) which is quite high for a PaCA. Without the enemy being chilled this ability is not very useful and has no utility built into it, so now the tradeoff for the high damage on this ability is you must hit Flash Frost (which moves at 850) or have the enemy stand in your Glacial Storm for 1.5 seconds.\n\n{{champion:84}} **Akali - Mark of the Assassin** : 600 Range, 6-4 Cooldown, 60 Energy\nInitial Damage : 35/55/75/95/115 + 40% AP\nBonus Damage : 45/70/95/120/145 + 50% AP\nTotal Damage : 80/125/170/215/260 + 90% AP\nThe difference of total damage between Anivia and Akali is 40 base and 10% AP. The trade that Akali gets from a low initial damage is a return of 40 energy and bonus damage from auto attacking the marked enemy. There is nothing Akali needs to set up before using this spell but she will need to get up to melee range while the enemy is marked for 6 seconds.\n\n{{champion:1}} **Annie - Disintegrate** : 625 Range, 4 Cooldown, 60-80 Mana\nDamage : 80/115/150/185/220 + 80% AP\nThe difference of total damage between Anivia and Annie is 80 base and 20% AP. The pro&#039;s of this ability over Anivia is that it costs less as the game continues, has longer range, deals more damage then an unchilled Frostbite, returns full mana and half the cooldown if it kills an enemy and can potentially stun for 1.25/1.5/1.75 seconds. The downside to this ability is that it will deal less damage then a chilled Anivia Frostbite.\n\n{{champion:69}} **Cassiopeia - Twin Fang** : 700 Range, 0.75 Cooldown, 40-80 Mana\nDamage : 52-120(based on level) + 10% AP\nBonus Damage : 10/40/70/100/130 +35% AP\nMax Damage : 250 + 45% AP\nAs there are a few variables in total damage i&#039;ll just use max level at Level 18. The max damage difference between Anivia and Cassiopeia is 50 Base and 65% AP. I usually think of this ability being the closest to Anivia&#039;s Frostbite as it does bonus damage if it has been set up right its able to be spammed more.\nPros : 100 more range, 3.25 shorter cooldown, 10 cheaper mana, 5-22 + 10% AP heal(if poisoned), mana cost returned if kills target.\nThis ability is able to be used 5 times in the span of 1 Frostbite and Cassiopeia gains access to reliably applying poison pre-6 meaning her laning phase she can play aggressive using this. (also found it interesting this ability has a range of 700 which is quite long for a PaCA)\n\n{{champion:38}} **Kassadin - Null Sphere** : 650 Range, 9 Cooldown, 70-90 Mana\nDamage : 65/95/125/155/185 + 70% AP\nSpell Shield : 40/70/100/130/160 + 30% AP\nThe difference in total damage between Anivia and Kassadin is 115 base and 30% AP. The difference in damage is made up in the fact that he has an extra 50 range, stops channels (have fun keeping your Glacial Storm up for 1.5 seconds) and provides a fairly big spell shield which allows him to lane. The cooldown and early mana cost for this spell are both quite high to make up for the utility this PaCA brings to his kit. Based with an unchilled Frostbite this ability has more damage.\n\n{{champion:50}} **Swain - Torment** : 625 Range, 10 Cooldown, 65-85 Mana\nDamage per second : 15/24/33/42/51 + 30% AP\nTotal Damage : 60/96/132/168/204 + 120% AP\nThe difference in total damage between Anivia and Swain is that Anivia has 96 higher base damage and Swain has 20% more AP. This spell has 25 more range, less cost late game and amplifies Swain&#039;s basic attacks and abilities by 20% to the target for 4 seconds. The trade it makes for this it has a fairly long cooldown, costs a bit more early game and is a damage over time ability (which isn&#039;t necessarily a bad thing). This PaCA will do more damage then an unchilled Frostbite after 2-3 seconds.\n\n{{champion:4}} **Twisted Fate** - Pick A Card : 525 Range, 6 Cooldown, 40-100 Mana\nBlue Card : 40/60/80/100/120 + 50% AP\nRed Card : 30/45/60/75/90 + 50% AP\nGold Card : 15/22.5/30/37.5/45 + 50% AP\nTwisted Fate is a little bit different as his PaCA is actually an enhancement to his auto attack but I just want to give him a shout out to say that his Pick A Card has tonnes of utility from a 50-150 mana return from just throwing a blue card to a 30%-50% slow on his red card or a 1-2 second stun from throwing his gold card. Not many abilities in League of Legends are a ranged PaCA stun anymore, only ones I can think of are Pantheon, Annie and Lissandra. Included in being a ranged PaCA stun, the stun length is also 2 seconds at max rank which can be used in a range of 5500. Anyway moving on from the salt, looking at any of his card they will deal more damage then an unchilled Frostbite as you have to take in the 100% AD included on his attack.\n\n{{champion:112}} **Viktor - Siphon Power** : 600/525 Range, 8-4 Cooldown, 45-65 Mana\nInitial Damage : 60/80/100/120/140 + 40% AP\nDischarge Damage : 20/40/60/80/100 + 50% AP\nTotal Damage : 80/120/160/200/240 + 90% AP\nThe difference in total damage between Anivia and Viktor is 60 base and 10% AP. This ability has lots of utility being in the form of a shield 8% max mana + 15% AP and a speed boost of 30% for 2.5 seconds for only 1250 (usually 2250 cause Aftershock) gold. Once he lands his initial Siphon Power, Viktor is then rewarded for auto attacking an enemy within a span of 3.5 seconds with a bonus discharge damage. To get this discharge damage he must move 75 units closer to the enemy to get off an auto attack as this ability has longer range. This ability is a low costing ability with a lower cooldown once levels go into this abilty and gives Viktor the tools to become a huge threat during the laning phase and taking trades like a man.\n\nIn conclusion Anivia does have high damage on a low cooldown IF able to apply chill onto an enemy. Without chilling the enemy Anivia&#039;s E has extremely low damage with no utility in the spell what-so ever. What I would like to see if Riot do not want to revert the forming Glacial Storm chilling enemies, I would like to see some form of utility going into her Frostbite. Quick shout-outs to a few other champions;\n{{champion:10}} **Kayle - Reckoning** - More of an attack speed champion then mage.\n{{champion:7}} **Leblanc - Shatter Orb** - Procs with her passive but was just focusing on single spells.\n{{champion:90}} **Malzahar - Malefic Visions** - Can apply onto multiple enemies.\n{{champion:80}} **Pantheon - Spear Shot** - Was looking at AP for easier comparisons.\n{{champion:13}} **Ryze - Spell Flux** - Can apply onto multiple enemies.\n{{champion:134}} **Syndra - Unleashed Power** - Is an ultimate ability.\n\nCheers for reading this update/edit/bonus information, just want to say I want Anivia to the champion that I love and have healthy gameplay for both opponents and the person playing Anivia. Also accidently deleted the last post so just reuploading this one. xo\n\n**Extra Content 29/11/16**\nChampion.gg has released information regarding V6.23 Anivia. I have also been reading peoples opinions on her and tried her a bit as well and my feeling toward this new Anivia has slightly changed however I stand by that you probably play any other mage as she still feels extremely weak compared to others.\n\n**V6.22** - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - **V6.23**\nRole Position : 10/48 - - - - - - - - - - 29/48\nWin Rate : 53.8% - - - - - - - - - - - - - -50.27%\nPlay Rate : 2.66% - - - - - - - - - - - - - -2.39%\nBan Rate : 0.52% - - - - - - - - - - - - - -0.63%\nGold : 12566 - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 12572\nKills : 7.36 - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -6.71\nDeaths : 5.09 - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -5.21\nAssists : 7.6 - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 7.79\nDamage : 22902 - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 21470\nSpree : 3.92 - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 3.57\nMinions : 174 - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 181\n\nDidn't really know how else to format that information so that'll do.\n*Role Position* is Champion.gg's way of determining what the best champion is for each role based of a number of different numbers. Right now Anivia dropped from being the 10th best mid laner to the 29th best mid laner which means she is now in the worst 50% of champions based from Champion.gg.\n*Win Rate* has dropped 19 positions based upon other mid laners which now puts her at 50.27% win rate which is a fairly big drop of 3.5% and actually makes her in the worst 50% of win rates based on mid laners. It isn't as bad as a couple of days after the release of the patch.\n*Play Rate* has only dropped by 0.27% which isn't as big of a drop as I thought there would be, just shows how dedicated some Anivia players are. Makes her the middle of most played champions.\n*Ban Rate* actually increased from 0.52% to 0.63%. I don't know why, people may of saw a change in the patch notes and thought It was a buff maybe? She is still in the lowest 50% of bans.\n*Gold* per game increased by 6 which is the biggest buff in the world. Still the low end of champions.\n*Kills* was where i expected the biggest change and it was a big change of 0.65 less kills per game on average. I understand that she is a Zone Control mage however being 40/48 champions with the most kills is so low, she dropped 10 places from last patch.\n*Deaths*increased by 0.11 per game which isn't a big enough deal to worry about, she is still one of the best mages to survive due to her passive rivaled ONLY by the Cant Killean the Zilean.\n*Assists* have increased by 0.19 which fits her utility scene more however she is still in the lowest 50% of champions with assists.\n*Damage* per game has decreased by a considerable amount from 22902 to 21470 and has made Anivia drop 19 positions compared to other mid laners making her 42/48. \n*Spree* is how many kills a champion can get before dying. 0.35 doesn't seem like a big fall however Anivia fell 16 places against the other mid laners. Killing Spree's don't really matter to much however so I'm not really worried about this stat due to Anivia's Rebirth.\n*Minion* kills per game has increased by 7 making her jump up 5 spots to become 17/48. Known as the best waveclearer in the game she isn't even in the top 10 of minions killed per game which sucks.\n\nIn conclusion after V6.23 Anivia has seen drops in basically every stat. This just shows that some champions just do her job much better and more reliably and it sucks that a 2.5% play rate and 0.6% ban rate champion was targeted before other more notorious mages. Anivia is still ok to take mid lane but I would only take her there against an extremely passive lane with little to no mobility or into a champion with predictable gap closers, other then that play another mage. xo ","replies":[{"poster":"PhRoXz0n","date":"2016-11-24T04:02:26.379+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"You seem to be discounting the damage that the R does as well which did at least 1 full tick (80 + 0.25 base) if they stood in it for 0.5 seconds. \n\nThe intention was also to move her more into a zone control mage and because she didn't promote particularly healthy gameplay in lane.","replies":[{"poster":"Beaunivia","date":"2016-11-24T05:44:52.639+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Fizz Enthusiast,realm=NA,application-id=FjGAIbRv,discussion-id=3Xwf4nHx,comment-id=000a,timestamp=2016-11-24T04:02:26.379+0000)\n>\n> You seem to be discounting the damage that the R does as well which did at least 1 full tick (80 + 0.25 base) if they stood in it for 0.5 seconds. \n> \n> The intention was also to move her more into a zone control mage and because she didn&#x27;t promote particularly healthy gameplay in lane.\n\nTrue, but that's only because of the initial cast damage, after that 0.5 seconds they'd be taking (40 + 0.125) and now after V6.23 that first 0.5 seconds is now (40 + 0.125) and each 0.5 seconds of staying in it they'd be taking (20 + 0.0625). I don't like how in 1 patch both the initial damage on her ult is decreased and the E->R combo was removed, just feels kind of harsh. The ultimate building up faster to deal more damage is nice, I think they need to stand in your ultimate for 2.5 seconds before the damage is a buff.\n\nI'm happy that she's being pushed to become a zone control mage, it'll make her feel more unique. The unhealthy gameplay in lane is the E->R combo? When I'm playing Anivia right now I feel like its more unhealthy as I have to use a lot of mana to try to get a successful trade off whereas I could save my mana and just farm safely and have no immediate interaction with my lane opponent. Most champions have a way to trade whether its constantly poking (Xerath, Ziggs, Varus), using a 2  button combo (Orianna, Azir, Cassiopeia) or going all in (Fizz, Annie, Syndra). \n\nI just feel she needs a little bit more work done to her kit as she doesn't feel as rewarding to play with as most other mages.\n\nAlso quickly, just saw a few games in your match history playing Anivia, how do you feel about her?

It&#x27;s not good enough to leave her with such a mediocre mid game.\n\nI wouldn't say she has one of the worst laning phases, as a champion (before V6.23) she sacrificed the ability to reliably trade pre-6 to be able to trade quite well and fast post-6. Now you have lost the ability the make quick trades, her laning phase had been reduced to 'just farming' which she can do well but its unhealthy gameplay and she doesn't hard scale by herself to make the farm heavy champion worth. But yeah, she really doesn't have a great time during the laning phase.","replies":[{"poster":"Requiemsfire","date":"2016-11-23T21:23:02.889+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Just imagine a Syndra vs anivia lane now and let it sink in that if the syndra is any good, she'll probably delete Anivia's relevance in the game ;) Now you can't even do anything to her at level 6 while she sets up her ult to nuke you everytime you come to lane, you can't punish if she should disrespect your ultimate all together.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Requiemsfire","date":"2016-11-23T13:55:41.039+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Just to put it out there, a lot of decent anivia players can be put behind by simply shoving the wave continuously before level 6.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"SlothChan","date":"2016-11-26T23:35:20.048+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I totally agree with this Anivia needs to be reworked in some way or just straight up buffed compared to other mid laners shes really not very good and is being more so played support now.","replies":[]},{"poster":"BirdyDan","date":"2016-11-24T03:18:18.123+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"MAKE ANIVIA GREAT AGAIN!","replies":[{"poster":"Beaunivia","date":"2016-11-24T03:20:44.878+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=The Cryophoenix,realm=OCE,application-id=FjGAIbRv,discussion-id=3Xwf4nHx,comment-id=0009,timestamp=2016-11-24T03:18:18.123+0000)\n>\n> MAKE ANIVIA GREAT AGAIN!\n\nShould give Anivia a Trump skin","replies":[{"poster":"BirdyDan","date":"2016-11-24T03:36:34.415+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Its already in the game!

But yeah I understand what you mean, I rarely see Master Yi's these days. The last time I really saw him was when being sated was a thing, but I agree with Riot farming in your jungle for 20 minutes was unhealthy for the game and left it very stagnant as the jungler wasn't making any plays early. I still believe if you're a good Master Yi and can make it through to late game you'll be quite hard to stop especially in soloq, same as Anivia, if you can get past laning phase you should be ok. Just why would you play them when you could play champions that do the same thing but do it better and have less weaknesses.  \n\nKalista has been gutted beyond belief, I think she's pretty unplayable at the moment.\nJanna will always be a great support just due to the fact that she has so much utility with movement speed, knock up, knock back, heal, shield, slow and an ad steroid. If she had the worst numbers in the game she would still probably be viable just due to the amount of peel she brings.\nI'm assuming the Maokai ultimate nerf? I haven't really played Maokai but whenever I've versed him I've felt he's fine. Think the problem with him was he was very one dimensional and being just a straight up tank.\nSwain is still played a bit and I feel he's quite strong. Like Anivia his laning phase was hurt a bit with an extra 10 seconds on his ult but he's still a solid champion with a good amount of sustain and some decent waveclear early. His itemization is the thing that makes him so strong imo.\nI remember never seeing Kassadin in the early days of League of Legends because of his perma ban in soloq. I think he's a hard champ to balance just due to his ultimate being so versatile and making him extremely mobile. I think he's in a decent spot right now in the right match up, but could deal with a minor change somewhere in his kit or base stats.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Xyltin","date":"2016-11-23T18:33:06.560+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I like the firt part a lot.\n\nThe problem I see here is the comparison between different kind of champions.

The first way of trading is Poking which is your Xerath, Ziggs, Vel'Koz. They use 1 button to throw a skill shot sometimes hitting their target, sometimes not. They are usually quite squishy champions but make up for it with their long range. The second trade is by a 2 Button Combo which is your Orianna, Azir, Cassiopeia. They usually use 2 of their abilities and make quite a strong trade. The trades usually have a form of utility whether it being a small cc or a slight buff to the champ. These champions are usually by control mages and used to be where Anivia used to be. The last way of trading is not really trading but going all in usually having to fight 100->0, usually called All In. These champions are like Annie, Syndra, Fizz. These champions have a huge amount of burst on their abilities and their ultimates have big single target damage. They are usually shorter range and even melee but make up for it while the 100->0 potential. Anivia now feels like she fits into the All In style of trading which she can't really compete with the Annie's or Fizz's.\n\nAs most champions have a fair amount of mobility of escapes it is very hard to make champions stay in your ultimate for 1.5 seconds, hence why it is usually just better to use your ultimate on minions instead of using more mana for a chance of dealing damage to your opponent. Its just quite unreliable especially verse certain match ups. Pretty much the story of Anivia to me right now is that there are now mages that do her job more reliably, less mana, more damage, much safer and have a good laning phase.\n\nYeah if you check the patch history not many changes have been done to her for first 5 seasons as she was seen as balanced and I often heard that Anivia was the most balanced champion, her trade offs (unreliable damage pre-6, high mana costs, lowest mobility, lowest health) made up for her having (post-6 reliable damage, high ap ratios, waveclear, long range aa).","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Srkkk","date":"2017-05-07T05:39:45.443+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"nowadays playing anivia is like never trade, just farm. it hurts you to trying to trade, any above average player can dodge that slow Q. without Q no damage, I am not happy with the change but meh, riot is riot, give 0 care,\nalso I feel like anivia's build has no variation, due to the high mana cost. maybe after taking away the damage, they can reduce the mana cost to like a normal mid laner?","replies":[]},{"poster":"Beaunivia","date":"2016-11-27T04:10:16.849+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Gizzel Reformed ,realm=OCE,application-id=FjGAIbRv,discussion-id=3Xwf4nHx,comment-id=000d,timestamp=2016-11-26T05:21:05.251+0000)\n>\n> I agree, they nerfed anivia too hard.

I mean it would be cool if they looked into it but I doubt that would really help Anivia or the game itself haha.\n\n> [{quoted}](name=Dragoshade,realm=EUW,application-id=FjGAIbRv,discussion-id=3Xwf4nHx,comment-id=0005,timestamp=2016-11-23T18:16:06.891+0000)\n>\n> I feel the damage nerfs were unwarranted both in terms of hitting spells and waveclear. As well as the change that stops E proccing on a Q that doesn&#x27;t stun. However if feel you are missing the point on some of the other changes:\n> \n> Riots stance at the moment is about adding a window of counter play. Dodging E-&gt;R is almost impossible and it nets a minimum of 100% ap ratio (plus the ult ticks and thunderlords). Yes this is a direct nerf to her burst but as a control mage, she should be rewarded for keeping enemies in an area. Not for a 1 Second toggle.\n> \n> You haven&#x27;t mentioned anything about her Q still procing the double damage on E. This is adds more precision and control into hitting it, and gives her the weakness for missing it. Meaning it carries more weight of whether it should be used offensively or defensively. \n> \n> Q can still do damage twice meaning that a Q-&gt;E combo can do minimum 180% ap + 220 + thunderlords (level 2). I think that is more than any of the other combo&#x27;s you mentioned...\n> \n> EDIT: her winrate is currently 53% op.gg\n\nFor a champion that has never been top pick in the pro scene or a must pick/ban in soloq I feel these constant nerfs are very harsh.\n\nI definitely can see how unhealthy the combo was, however since Anivia must usually go for a fair amount of sustain early the 100% AP ratio will not do a lot of damage. Plus compared to other mages, getting into 600 range of one will mean they will be able to use their abilities too which really and truly don't actually do too much less damage then Anivia's. I'd be fine with losing her trading capabilities for more utility or interaction on her Frostbite.\n\nShe still always had the weakness of missing it. Pre-6 if you miss your Flash Frost you can expect to be under your tower for the next 12 seconds until it comes off cooldown. Now post-6 if your miss your Flash Frost you're gonna feel like its pre-6 except being able to farm more efficiently. The window is too big and punishing for missing Flash Frost.\n\nIt does more damage then all the other combo's however, your Flash Frost does have a long cooldown compared to other spells. Annie for example does 150 Base + 165% AP however she trades the lower base and ap ratio for the spell rotation to come off cooldown 4 seconds earlier, a longer stun (if using passive corrently), slightly longer range and the ability to use her rotation more reliably as her Disintegrate can be a PaCA stun. Now I know Annie would come under a burst mage over a control mage but just saying its not just about the raw damage in trades, the reliability, cost of the ability, cooldown of the ability and any utility in the abilities count as well.\n\nAhk, yeah once Champion.gg update the Anivia changes I'll look at updating the winrates and should be able to put more information in but I am expecting a fairly decent drop in win rate/play rate/damage dealt/damage taken and kills. \n\n> [{quoted}](name=Xyltin,realm=EUW,application-id=FjGAIbRv,discussion-id=3Xwf4nHx,comment-id=0006,timestamp=2016-11-23T18:33:06.560+0000)\n>\n> I like the firt part a lot.\n> \n> The problem I see here is the comparison between different kind of champions.

Curently all the data that exists in the end is this: http://lolalytics.com/champion/Anivia/Middle/\n> 2.5M games is a good amount but 1 day is not enough.\n> \n> If she is too weak I think a mana cost reduction for W at lower ranks could help. The lower CD is nice and can do a lot in lane but a combo with W + Q + E costs 200-220 mana at lvl 1-5. I think more Ws would be nice and help her to deal with the new situation.\n\nCheers man, and yeah I just want to explain the differences in PaCA and also just some basic combos, its not always just about raw damage output that makes something too strong.\n\nYeah i'm going to wait for Champion.gg to update with V6.23 before I can actually see what's happening.\n\nThat's always been a problem for Anivia is her mana costs, she usually had to spend 1850 gold to get her sustain in check before actually buying some ability power. Also add 300 gold for boots in there too. I'm just finding there's more benefits from just using your spells to farm from safety then actually doing anything exciting in lane cause it just costs too much mana and cooldowns. I really do like the cooldown decrease though, but there is more they can do with that ability that I would love to see.\n\n> [{quoted}](name=Requiemsfire,realm=OCE,application-id=FjGAIbRv,discussion-id=3Xwf4nHx,comment-id=000100000001,timestamp=2016-11-23T21:23:02.889+0000)\n>\n> Just imagine a Syndra vs anivia lane now and let it sink in that if the syndra is any good, she&#x27;ll probably delete Anivia&#x27;s relevance in the game ;) Now you can&#x27;t even do anything to her at level 6 while she sets up her ult to nuke you everytime you come to lane, you can&#x27;t punish if she should disrespect your ultimate all together.\n\nVersing any champion that can take advantage of your weak laning phase, they can just zone you away from minions. She will be roughly the same later on in the game past laning phase, so against a player that doesn't take advantage of her you can still scale fairly well into the mid game. Up in Diamond+, I've had most people just zone me away from my minions even post-6 which is what I hate about her not being able to trade efficiently. Most mages have a way to disrupt her Glacial Storm so even if you try to wall them in, they can just stop it before you can charge it up for a Frostbite.","replies":[]}]}
