If you notice that you can open the launcher but when the actual game starts nothing happens and all you get is the reconnect screen and Everytime you hit reconnect nothing happens then your anti virus might be blocking the application from freely opening new windows. Now do that rush into fixing this as doing the wrong thing can get you perma banned. The simple solution is to go into your anti virus and add league of legends into you firewalls exclusions list so it will allow it to do what it needs to do, DO NOT DO THIS!!! I made this mistake and what I didn&#039;t realise was that this will pair league of legends with a 3rd party program which will get you permabanned. What you should do is simply find another anti virus that doesn&#039;t block league of legends. It might be a hassle but it&#039;s better than what happened to me. If I save one innocent player from a ban then this was worth my time. Learn from.my mistake friends. I do hope this helped you. If you are having further trouble with your anti virus contact the support desk of said anti virus but for the love of God just don&#039;t tell uch your league client, I cannot stress this enough","replies":[{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2018-02-13T00:12:15.357+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"An antivirus would not trigger a 3rd party ban on your account.
