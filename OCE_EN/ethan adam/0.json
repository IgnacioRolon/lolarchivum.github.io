I tried to make a support ticket to discuss said evidence with riot but they said they wouldn&#039;t even listen and that they would not even review the subject matter. Eventually I was told that if I tried to continue with the subject or make another ticket that they would be closed without response. Is there anything else I can do or is that just it? Like this is my favourite game and I&#039;ve been playing for near 5 years and I&#039;d hate to see it all come to an end. I don&#039;t want to argue with anyone I just want to be heard. Any one have any suggestions or should I just walk away. I really do just want to play the game I&#039;ve come to enjoy so much. What should I do?","replies":[{"poster":"Ethan Adam","date":"2018-02-13T02:51:18.240+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"ok so here is my time line of events that i believe support my claim off innocence \n\nEarly January:\ni start getting messages saying that someone logged into my account from another computer, i get these about once every 2-3 days. i check my match history and no games were played and i check the shop and see that nothing has been bought on my account of gifted to another and i check my bank statement and see that nothing has been charged so at first i think this is a glitch. i dont think much of it.\n\na few days later i log on to find that my account is in game as lee sin. this game is in my match history and happened on the 7th of january 2018. its only now that i realise that someone is actually on my account, whether or not this person was hacking i cant say. i immediatly change the password to my account on from that day on i never got the messages again.\n\nafter realising i was hacked i decided that i needed an anti virus and my friend recommended Malwarebytes so i downloaded and installed it. at first there was no issues. though after an update to league i suddenly encounter a bug that wouldnt let me join a game. i could get as far as the champ select screen but instead of opening the loading screen i was given the reconnect screen and when i clicked reconnect nothing happened. i try relogging a few times and nothing seems to work. after about 3 relogs i run as admin and hit reconnecta about 5 times and suddenly it works and i join the game. this happened on the ziggs aram game that i played on the 16th of january 2018. the next game after this went down fine and i thought all was well, just a minor hiccup. since i thought the issue was gone i tried to play a ranked game as eve and encountered the same issue but unlike before no matter how much i tried i could not join the game. eventually i was hit with a disconnect. \n\ni sent in a bug report to riot after the either the ziggs game or the eve game, i cant remember but i did send a bug report out lining this issue. around this time i realise that ive had this issue before. during the life cycle of black ops 3 one day it seemed i could open the game but it would stop working on the home screen, after some digging i found that apparently certain anti viruses can block the game so i deleted mine so i could play** (hence why i didnt have a anti virus at the start of the story and yes i realise how stupid i look for leaving my computer open to virus so i could play cod, im not tech savy)** So i realise that my issues started when i started using a new anti virus so it must be that. since i was hacked i wasnt so quick to uninstall it this time (i wish i had) instead i find the exclusions tab and realise i can add applications to the exclusions tab so malwarebytes will let them work through the firewall.\n\nnow this is where i think the trouble begins. i add both league of legends folders and the launchers to this list so that malware shouldnt block them any more. i didnt occur to me at the time that this was pairing league with a 3rd party program. after i did this i had no issues joining into a game and all seemed well and good. **(note: this all took place just after mid night so it would be the morning of january 17th)**\n\n**(side note, i have a screen cap of what this exclusion thing looked like but i dont know how to upload it so if anyone can help me i would like to add this evidense)**\n\nyou will see in my match history that i played 8 games on the 17th without a single issue, all was fine and dandy and my exclusion addition i made earlier that day seemed to be working a treat.\n\nJanuary 18th, 2018:\ni wake up in the morning to find that i have an email from riot. it said that due to the use of 3rd party programs i was perminantly banned. i immediatly made a support ticket and got a quick response from RIOT LunaFox **(just a little note here, LunaFox was beyond helpful at this time and they will be the only person i name here cause they were great to deal with)**\n\nI told LunaFox about the connection issue and what i did with my anti virus but he said this probably had no impact on my ban and asked about some \"suspicious logins\". i told him about the hacker incident and he asked for some private info to prove i was the real owner of the account and after talking for a bit LunaFox unbanned my account and told me to seek better account safety tips. Due to them saying that my anti virus probably wasnt to blame i made no changes to it\n\nJanuary 20th:\nmove to perth and start playing from a new ip, all is well except for some lag based issues to the crap internet where i now live but i never had the reconnect issue again\n\nFebuary 7th:\ni wake up to my current ban that im trying to resolve\n\n\n\n\n\nand thats the story. except for this hacker issue i have never had someone on my account so all my actions are my own. i have never been in trouble with riot except for low priority cues due to disconnecting from lag. If you look at my match history my average scores never change. if i was actually hacking shouldnt my scores be sky rocketing. if you look at my match history and in game activity it is clear that i wasnt hacking. why risk my account to do no better in game? thats crazy. this is all a big misunderstanding and this is where i think the grey area lies.\n\nyes, i paired my client with a 3rd party program but clearly i made no attempt to actually influence the game. I was just trying to play the game. i made no attempt to cheat so is this really worth a life time ban. i have some quotes here from riots support page\n\n_Riot's Stance\nNo software should interfere directly with the in-game player experience, from when you press “Play” to the end-of-game screen.\n\nSuspensions for the use of third-party applications can vary in length depending on the severity of the offense, up to a permanent suspension for consistent, blatant use. If these applications were used to gain rating in ranked, we may also remove the account’s ranked rewards for the season._\n\n\nin my instance i gained absoultely no in game advantage from what i did and in regards to the second quote it says up to premanent ban for consistant and blatant use but i was never even given a warning so it seems that i didnt go against riots stance on 3rd party programs and even if i did it would seem i should at least get a chance to fix this issue.\n\n\n\n\n\n if there are any gaps in my story you guys think need filling in id gladly do so i do hope riot can reconsider this ban. i didnt hack and my match history, event time line, screenshots and actions i believe support this claim so i please ask that you at least give it some thought after reading this. League is my favourite game and id love to resume playing fairly.","replies":[{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2018-02-13T03:08:14.829+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Ok so first I can say with 98% certainty that the antivirus stuff had absolutely nothing to do with your ban. I've seen a lot of these sort of posts and walked through a lot of these cases, and to me these are the relevant points:\n\n>Early January:\ni start getting messages saying that someone logged into my account from another computer, i get these about once every 2-3 days.\n\nI'll be blunt, you were foolish to ignore these. These messages occur when you are kicked out by someone else logging in. Obviously it wasn't you logging in on another computer so you really should have reset your password here instead of waiting for them to actually play a game.\n\n>a few days later i log on to find that my account is in game as lee sin... i immediatly change the password to my account on from that day on i never got the messages again.\n\nGood move, as much as you should have done it sooner. Best thing you can do if you even *suspect* something fishy is going on is to change your password, whether you see games played or not.\n\n>after realising i was hacked i decided that i needed an anti virus and my friend recommended Malwarebytes so i downloaded and installed it\n\nNot a bad recommendation at all, if you're using the free version you should try to run scans at least once a month (more if you find yourself virus prone). It's unlikely a virus was the cause of the compromise (and in saying that I would recommend changing the password of the email address associated with your account as well, especially if it is/was the same) but it's never a good idea to just leave viruses floating around.\n\n>now this is where i think the trouble begins. i add both league of legends folders and the launchers to this list so that malware shouldnt block them any more.\n\nVery unlikely. If anything you are removing Malwarebytes' influence from League, not adding it. Technically yes, it counts as a 3rd party program, but it's only certain 3rd party programs that will get you banned, as was mentioned in the ticket (anything that gives you an unfair advantage). You won't get banned for using Malwarebytes anymore than you would for using Discord.\n\n3rd party bans tend to go out in waves, so while the timing may have led you to believe it was antivirus issues, it could well still be something stemming from that initial compromise, or from another compromise after the fact.\n\n___\n\nOk so all that said and hopefully adequately explained, assuming you didn't get curious and for some reason decide to give some scripts a whirl this is probably related to that first compromise. I take it you haven't noticed any suspicious activity on the account since you secured it?\n\nAs I understand it you have made a few more tickets to support, did you explain the previous compromise, or simply quote your antivirus (what you thought was the problem)?\n\nDid support tell you anything else or just \"we won't unban your account\"?","replies":[{"poster":"Ethan Adam","date":"2018-02-13T03:19:07.769+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"just to clarify that i have never used scripts in my life. never have, never will for this exact reason.\n\nduring my first ticket with LunaFox im not sure if i mentioned it first or if he did but we did discuss it and he did tell me that he could clearly see that it wasnt me on my account.\n\nduring the second ticket i never got a chance to explain. all i got was the same response worded differently 4 times. this consisted of them telling me that i was banned for using 3rd party software and that they wouldnt lift the ban. when i asked if i could just explain what happened i was told that their decision wouldnt be changed and that if i didnt stop with the subject or if i attempted to file more tickets my tickets would just be closed withour response.\n\nafter i changed my passwords i never saw the \"you account has been accessed from another computer\" message again and never nothiced any suspiousness on my account as far as match history and the store go.\n\nsince this has all happened i have completely removed malwarebytes from my computer and i did file a support ticket with them to discuss this event.\n\nthank you for taking the time to read this and respond in such depth, it really feels good to actually be listened to. i hope we can work together her and with riot to smooth this all out cause i am beyond keen to get back to playing.

It should go without saying but I'll still say it, if you ever used any scripts or disallowed third party apps the ban will not be revoked under any circumstances. Cheating bans are permanent from first offence, there's no wiggle room.\n\nNow that said, you say you were wrongfully banned, could you elaborate? (Don't post any identifying info on boards). \n\nCheating bans are by the far the most accurate, since it's a pretty black and white yes or no as to whether something illicit was used on the account, the chance of it being a false positive is extremely slim in these cases.
