I seem to have decent objective control but do not seem to be able to end up as impactful as the enemy jungler about 70% of the time. \r\n\r\nI was hoping I could get some help to have a look into a VOD review. I did consider going to a coaching website but I think mostly I'd be keen to see if someone could do a small VOD review instead. \r\n\r\nThank you, \r\nHere is my Discord BerserkerFury#9450. Message on there or on this thread if you would be looking to help. \r\nJust an hour out of your day, even if you charge I'd consider it I would just like some advice :c","replies":[{"poster":"Broken Scripts","date":"2019-12-16T11:00:11.684+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'll do it.
