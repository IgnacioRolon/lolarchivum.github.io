I really enjoyed the fact I could outplay my lane opponent and every little decision I made counted. \n\nNow I have returned it just feels like it&#039;s fight after fight and individual skill is not as relevent and more about who has the better champ for small skirmishes. And this free constant map vision makes jungling boring for me\n\nAny advice on current meta, runes, masteries, champs to play, etc is appreciated","replies":[]}
