However the game once I fell in love is gone. Riot tries sooo hard to make me come back to the game again and again. However times have changed. League is not fun anymore. Remember the times like ap {{champion:11}} , or ap {{champion:18}} . How often can you do that now? Nowadays when you try something innovative and unique just for fun and tries to be useful, and \r\nimmediately get told off by other people that it is stupid, and it deals no damage. What&#039;s happening to league nowadays. The people want to be inventive are getting banned or reported for no reason.  Imagine if those people didn&#039;t exist. How come ap Yi exist? But I am not saying that building Blue Shen ( Shaclone ) or Disco Nunu ( Pornstar Zilean ) is innovative, they are just trolls. Therefore I decided to quit league.","replies":[{"poster":"SEKAI","date":"2017-04-30T12:00:59.692+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"AP Yi was literally the epitome of anti-fun, where he just builds AP and more AP via stacking Deathcap, and then proceeded to 1 shot the entire enemy team with literally no counterplay as long as the player has a brain. Due to the fact Q's AP scaling used to be higher than AD if I recall correctly, it used to be much easier to pick up kills with Q, and it would trigger his refreshing indefinitely until the entire enemy team is dead. To rub more salt onto injury, the old Alpha Strike was poorly programmed, so it also allowed Yi to RNG attack and kill enemy players off-screen with Q's following up attacks. And wait, there's more, because his W is AP scaling, it also makes Yi immortal as long as he doesn't get interrupted; I remember the CD used to be much shorter than it is now too.\n\nAfter a couple attempt at balancing him and failing to make it meaningful and manageable, they just straight up removed the AP aspect after his rework and merge it with AD Yi, which is understandable.\n\nAP Tris was in a similar boot, jump in, 1 shot, refresh, jump out. No fun.\n\n......................\n\nOne could argue that players may be getting less open to new things and getting un-inventive when it comes to build and pick diversity, and that's certainly true, but finding and exploiting the broken aspect of the game is also nothing to celebrate about either.","replies":[{"poster":"Talon12","date":"2017-04-30T12:50:45.733+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yi ult used to be on r, hit 10 times, have 150% ap scale and target enemy champs, also could re-hit enemy champs that have been hit before.

One in ten people had fun in those days, and that was only the person playing him. And unless I'm mistaken, it was 100% the reason why he was re-worked, Riot even released a video of him using his W while being attacked in a 1v5 situation and he came out with more health than when he went in.\n\nHowever, that being said, fun is subjective, _(we know this because there are Garen mains)_. So what is not fun for some, can be fun for others.\nAnd while they are annoying to deal with sometimes, or ruin your team comps and give you anxiety attacks in ranked. Off-meta builds and picks were quite fun occasionally. _(I got my first normals penta with AP Ezreal.)_\n\n______\n\nThe reason _(I suspect)_, that off-meta builds have fallen a little by the wayside, is because of the escalation that exists in league.\n\nChampions have been progressively getting more and more powerful _(in terms of damage)_, over the last couple of years _(partly due to items)_. Riot doesn't like nerfing their damage, because then it puts players off that champion. So rather than nerfing one champion, they try to bring the others up to that level.\n\nHowever this causes an arms race, Vayne gets too strong, they buff Zed to get rid of her, Zed gets too strong, they buff Shen to get rid of him, Shen gets too strong, they buff Vayne to get rid of Shen, and they cycle keeps going and going, and all of the champions just keep getting more and more powerful, until it gets to the point where everyone 1-hits everyone else. _(and it feels like that point is getting close)_ \nYou can see this happening in bot lane, the whole mage-as-support thing where everyone just picks Brand, Zyra, and co. and just blitzes the enemy with damage, is pushing out regular supports. Meanwhile old mostly-supports have gotten so much damage _(Like Karma)_ that they have taken up permanent residence in the mid lane.\n\nThe off-meta builds just cant keep up with the new levels of damage. So theres no point trying them, so people just don't. \nWhy build AD teemo when you can just pick Draven? Why play AP Warwick, when you can be tanker and do more damage with normal Warwick, Why play tank Evelynn when you can just pick Udyr? Infact why pick Evelynn at all when you can just play Rengar, who does basically the same thing but better?\n\n_______\n\nThat being said, there are many off-meta picks and builds that have succeeded far better than the 'recommended' ones and have since become meta themselves. For example:\n\nGraves wasn't intended to be a jungler...\nEkko wasn't intended to be a tank..\nJarvan was supposed to be a tank fighter, and i haven't seen him **not** one-shot someone in forever now...\nBard wasn't supposed to be an attack-speed soul-shredding chiming machine, but you hardly see a Bard these days without at least Nashors...\nI dont even know if Shaco is supposed to be AD or AP anymore, there are even levels of both. and they are just as deadly as eachother...\nJungle Aurelion Sol _technically_ has one of the highest win rates _(which makes me so mad because there literally couldn't be a champ less-suited to clearing)_..\n\nSo there are off-meta builds happening all the time, but the meta has since shifted and what was once off-meta has now become the norm.\n\nBut the meta is a living breathing thing, _(at the constant mercy of whatever the pros do though.. admittedly)_ and it does change.\nSo I would encourage you to stay in League, wait out this phase, and see where the meta goes next, maybe off-meta builds and picks, will come back into the spotlight. Don't quit the game we all love, just because you don't like the current fashion. \n\n____\n\n_**TL;DR:** Theres some freaky-deaky shit happening with balance atm, it makes off-meta builds often not worth it. But they aren't gone from the game, so stay with us!_","replies":[]}]}
