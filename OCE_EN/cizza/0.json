Buying a Rangers Trailblazer - Devourer on Shaco causes OVER 9000 dogs to spawn and they cause minion blocks.. 110% makes me rage, since I&#039;m a Shaco main. Please fix this ASAP because it is extremely annoying and I&#039;m trying my best not to use swear words in this post.\r\n\r\nNo but seriously, the bug that happens is that you somehow manage to spawn A LOT of dogs that follow you around... I&#039;m not sure how / why this happens, it may also have something to do with buying a tiamat / hydra on Shaco with the Rangers Trailblazer - Devourer.{{item:3077}} {{item:3074}} \r\n\r\n{{champion:35}} {{item:3726}}","replies":[{"poster":"Mindstar","date":"2015-07-27T05:32:17.559+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey Cizza,\n\nThanks for the report!
