Back in season 1-2 there was no oceanic server only the NA one. You can move your account to the OCE servers :) you will get a much better ping. If you click your account icon you will see the different countries you can select to move your account. This was free when it first happened I think you need to pay for it now.\n\n[Image of your account icon](http://iforce.co.nz/i/5ipqrpzs.p5h.jpg)\n\nIf you decide to move you account feel free to add me, can help with the basics :)","replies":[{"poster":"Mazsire","date":"2018-04-23T22:50:25.963+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'll be honest i didnt notice that lol. thats my bad. well i dont have the money to tranfer servers atm, but i can make new account.
