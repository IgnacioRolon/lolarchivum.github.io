You mentioned you had one available so that's an obvious check.\n\n**Were you playing a champ on the free to play rotation that you don't own?**\n You can't earn chests for champs you don't own.\n\n**Had you received a chest already on the champ YOU were playing? **\nThe chest links to the champ you're playing, and you can only earn one chest on a champ per year, so if you had already received a chest on that champ you wouldn't have received one for this game.","replies":[]}]}
