If any of the Riot development team see this, I&#039;d love to know your thoughts and feedback on such idea. This is basically a copy-paste of my submission to support (as I initially didn&#039;t know where to express this, but was promptly directed to post here on the boards).\r\n\r\n----------- \r\n\r\nNot sure if I have the right category for this exact query per say, but I would like to put forward a suggestion to the Riot team regarding the gifting of champions to other players. \r\n\r\nNow currently, you (yourself), can purchase champions for yourself via real money (ie: RP) or IP that you&#039;ve earnt by playing the game. When it comes to gifting champions however, you may only do so using RP. Now for me, don&#039;t get me wrong -- I complain a fair bit about the IP pricing of most champions I want -- however once I&#039;ve grinded down and gotten the total IP needed for a specific champ I want I&#039;m actually grateful and it feels like an accomplishment. But what I don&#039;t get is why we cannot have the option to gift a champion or two to a friend. Especially since one or two of my friends have nearly all the champs (apart from Tahm Kench -- can&#039;t wait for him to be finally released!), and so they basically have all this amounting IP collecting dust on their account.\r\n\r\nNow I know this may cause for some exploitation, especially where older accounts are concerned. They could then use this suggested idea to gift champions for IP (which is actually free, only earnt over a time period), and then sell them for real money -- much like how some people \"sell\" Diamond ELO accounts despite it being against your terms and conditions (it still happens sadly). This is where I&#039;ve thought of a counter towards this. Much like the \"refund tokens\" which we, ourselves can use to refund a skin we may no longer want and such -- we only get three. After that, no more. I then thought we could apply this by giving each player \"tokens\" to be only able to gift to ANY player (so long as they meet the standard gifting requirements), a total of 3 TIMES. That way, it&#039;s preventative from people trying to make money off of this form of gifting, because once you&#039;ve gifted champs using IP 3 times no one really would want to then make a new account from scratch to try to scam and make more money. People who scam want something quick, not something that would take a while to produce any results. This method would be more ideal than one my friend suggested prior, which was you could only RECEIVE 3 champions -- because being able to receive doesn&#039;t effectively prevent scamming and people trying to make money out of it.\r\n\r\nIf by now, you&#039;ve read through my whole rambling post, thanks. I hope you would be able to respond with any feedback upon my suggestion today as I would appreciate it. I just believe that having this option available but with limitations would be a nice change, as some of us would like to be able to gift a champion to someone else on our friend&#039;s list (my partner really would like to), but not all of us have money to spare just to gift a champion another may want.\r\n\r\n----------\r\n**TL;DR** - basically would like the option to gift champions for IP, but with limitations to only being able to gift three to anyone.","replies":[{"poster":"JasonWazza","date":"2015-07-10T21:51:20.216+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":">But what I don't get is why we cannot have the option to gift a champion or two to a friend. \n\nThe problem being that means the people with no need for IP can make smurfs and have most champs available instantly, and/or give it to someone else completely, sure this isn't a problem for the league PLAYERS persay but it is a problem for riot side as less money will be spent on buying champions.","replies":[{"poster":"ForStSpyda","date":"2015-07-11T08:10:03.972+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=JasonWazza,realm=OCE,application-id=Ntey9fRZ,discussion-id=Fulx1HeL,comment-id=0001,timestamp=2015-07-10T21:51:20.216+0000)\n>\n> The problem being that means the people with no need for IP can make smurfs and have most champs available instantly, and/or give it to someone else completely, sure this isn't a problem for the league PLAYERS persay but it is a problem for riot side as less money will be spent on buying champions.\n\nive never spent RP on a champion and Ive got 120 odd champs and loads of runes and rune pages got a few IP boosts and a few skins with RP once you have all the champs you like and loads of runes its not hard to accumulate 25k IP and not need anything at the time and a friend may need a champ and you could gift him cause he/she is relatively new to the game with only a few champs and says they really wana try a particular champ thats 6300 IP and they are only level 12 summoner that could be a very good gift indeed  :D    {{champion:238}}","replies":[]},{"poster":"Eshe","date":"2015-07-10T22:09:39.628+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"That's why I stated that EVERY account should only be able to send a total of THREE champions. Much less the same implementation as refund tokens. Most people don't have lets say... ten smurf accounts all for one person. That's ridiculous. \n\nRegardless, most people that I know of purchase the champions with IP themselves, and use RP for skins and such. So it wouldn't really be that much of a loss, considering each person would only be able to gift away 3 IP champions (it doesn't FORCE you to do so, if you don't want to -- that's fine). Also, Riot has other ways of making money (ie: skins, ward skins, chromas, icons, etc). Who's to say they won't implement another feature in the store to make more money. They are a company who has a free to play game but as a business -- yes they aim to make money off of it. Then again, what company wouldn't want to? \n\nAgain, there's the debate over whether Riot actually cares about what the players may want, so we will have to see what their own response is to this. I think for one, that they do care but I understand as a company they do need to make money somewhere.","replies":[{"poster":"JasonWazza","date":"2015-07-10T22:43:47.803+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Limiting to 3 is something i may have missed in my gloss over, however then i have to ask how is this just not a pointless thing?\n\nPeople with tons of IP can sink maybe 20k, and then nothing else they can do with it (and if someone knows 2/3 people who have massive IP stores that don't plan to use it on themselves, they could get 9 champs for nothing, this probably isn't the best).\n\nAnd sure it's an alright idea, it's just not something that makes sense if your gonna put a limit like 3 on it.","replies":[{"poster":"Eshe","date":"2015-07-10T23:01:54.402+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The limit of three is to prevent misuse of buying literally every champion for a completely new account if you had the IP saved for all of it. In my post, I said initially we threw the idea that a person could only RECEIVE three champions, but then that would provide anyone with the means to basically \"sell\" the champions they gifted for IP they've had lying around collecting dust and then getting some form of money out of it. That's when I suggested that instead, put a limit to THREE champions you are individually allowed to gift to anyone on your friends list (following gifting standard rules of course). But the limitation to just three isn't set in stone, it was just a number I threw out there because its the same number of times you are allowed to refund a skin, etc. \n\nAlso, how is it unfair? There is would be a limitation on how many you could gift using IP -- gifting champions using IP wouldn't be unfair because essentially someone with money could just BUY all the champions for RP. Would that be unfair? Also it's not really that unfair, considering RIot gives us the opportunity to try out new champs every week, and every champ has their own strengths and weaknesses. You just need to know how to use that to your advantage. It's not like I'm suggesting being able to gift runes because then that would be pointless and a major disadvantage.","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"ForStSpyda","date":"2015-07-10T21:41:58.236+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"now thats a good idea for spare IP buy a friend a champ thats a good idea!","replies":[]}]}
