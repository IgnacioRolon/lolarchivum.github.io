There are a lot of people leave unintentionally because their games crashed and they could not reconnect. One of my friends also has the 20 minutes penalty for 5 games and keeps getting it, which is very unfair because the person never leave intentionally and especially when their games crashed they could NOT reconnect.","replies":[]},{"poster":"A Pea Dough File","date":"2015-02-21T00:07:10.031+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Garlygunto,realm=OCE,application-id=ElA0rvVL,discussion-id=mROdjJuy,comment-id=,timestamp=2015-02-20T07:47:54.365+0000)\n>\n>I DONT RAGE \n\nSomehow, I don't think that raging on the forums is going to help your situations. Talk about blowing your own trumpet as well, everyone has left a game, everyone has said something toxic at one point and everyone has raged. Riot just ban people that do it each game, and they don't just hand out low priority ques for absolutely nothing. There is a reason and your not seeing it because your head is so far up your own a**.","replies":[]},{"poster":"HORSE OF FORCE","date":"2015-02-20T23:50:35.311+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"All caps.\n\n>PREDIGESTS\n\nwow\n\n>I NEVER GO AFK, MAYBE ONCE OR TWICE WHEN IVE GOTTEN ABSOLUTLEY FED WITH THE GAME\n\nJust read this again.
