It creates the ring, champions on the edge will not be hit due to the system Api not recognising champions who have been standing there","replies":[]},{"poster":"JasonWazza","date":"2016-01-01T09:47:12.058+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"No it's actually really accurate to the circle, the thing you might be noticing is that the Animation looks bigger for a few reasons.\n\n1. The animation goes off AFTER the move has calculated where people are (this is true of Cho's silence as well).\n2. The animation goes into the air, so it's possible you're expecting to hit people that are slightly above the animation.","replies":[]}]}
