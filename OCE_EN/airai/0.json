I definitely feel it was overall a rather big nerf removing grevious wounds (which I think should be reinstated - it was one of the few things that made her unique). Yet possibly more concerning to me is that she just feels, in my opinion, clunkier to play now. I was just wondering, are others feeling this too? Or perhaps am I overreacting. I just want to see if I&#039;m overreacting or if this is a real thing.\r\n\r\nKind Regards.","replies":[{"poster":"LÃ©gs","date":"2015-08-13T12:55:05.760+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I don't really feel that much of a difference, like to be honest I really don't think it was the grievous wounds that made her strong (for example, who picks miss fortune for her grevious wounds ? I thought we picked her for her dps or awesome synergy or whatever). I quite like activating my passive via 'w' for chasing or kiting/running away, still pretty happy with her :p","replies":[]},{"poster":"Slowdownn","date":"2015-08-06T01:20:56.094+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It is misfortune for all MF players! She does not play anything like what she was before.

She always feel clunky, but I like the clunkiness (just my own thing, most people don't). But her w at late game is insane at killing tanks without needing the grievous wounds.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Alamo","date":"2015-08-06T00:15:18.852+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Something about MF pisses me off, its probably the laugh she makes when she ults.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Airai","date":"2015-08-05T23:27:13.002+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thankyou for the responses. It's nice to see your opinions. Maybe it's just an adjustment thing and I need to play her a little more to get back to where I was with her :).","replies":[]},{"poster":"GigaPube","date":"2015-08-05T17:11:52.803+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"not much other adcs have grievous wounds and such a high winrate (for adcs) so it mightve been the right thing to do. i think her E sound has more detail to it so it might sound clunkier and thicker. not sure about the other abilities, her ulti makes her look like shes shooting it slower but im sure she isnt","replies":[]},{"poster":"SorakaXHealBoT","date":"2015-08-05T16:53:53.415+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I feel that she is ok because her W CD did get reduce and her E slow is increase and also now that her W give her the passive movespeed it will help miss fortune with kiting or she can use it as an escape. Other than that now her E  have a 40% slow at lvl 1 which make her good at chasing or slowing opponents to escape. Although i really don't think removing the grievous wound passive is necessary i feel that the decrease in CD of her W will improve her lategame by at least a little.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Jink","date":"2015-08-05T13:11:06.656+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Her Q cast animation feels a bit hesitant and the ultimates always sorta been like that but that's about it.\n\nShe just looks derpy when she does stuff lol.
