My alternative account has received both icons in the same PC with the same client already. \r\n\r\nI was trying to submit a ticket but the support web page keeps redirecting me to the board, so please help me to fix this and give what these events promised these summoner icons. Thank you so much.\r\n\r\nRegards","replies":[]}
