If so, consider just taking the role you had selected and say nothing. But if that player trolls, does poorly, affects the whole team in a negative way, they will find a bunch of reports and a ban coming their way. If they troll and you manage to win, lucky for your team and the troll. Generally this is what I do, just say nothing and play the game, unless:\n\n**2) Do you care about losing LP from this game?** If no, do the above. If so, then for sure, dodge, OR, **_if you can sense_** in champion select that your team is troubled by the troll pick, there is another option.\n\nSay nothing about the troll (and don't complain) and then lock in a ridiculous champ (one that you can play of course) and say \"hmm, i thought my role was ...., but since he took it, can i play .... in this role? I'll give it a go. Don't hate me though team, I'm only Bronze (Silver/Gold/Plat/Diamond) 5 and still learning about the game\". You will generally force out a dodge from someone else instead of having to waste it yourself, and then you can wait for a couple of  minutes before queueing again to avoid that troll. \n\n**3) Do you just play the game to improve and not care about your rank?** If so, just play the game and focus on the area you wanted to improve on. If that player mentioned trolls in game, its ok for you to troll in game also, so long as you are working on improving your gameplay. Chalk this game down as a loss before it even starts, and then go into game with the practice that you were looking for.\n\nRemember to /mute and /pingmute all during these \"toxic\" or \"troll\" style games, and say nothing negative in game. They could be baiting you to get YOU punished instead of them. You don't even want to listen to what the monkeys are saying.","replies":[{"poster":"Geniii","date":"2017-10-15T08:57:25.086+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thank you so much for taking the time to write out such a detailed response. All of those points are good depending on the situation, and I think in the situation I was in I should've just taken the 30 minute timer and left it at that. I will take the other points into account as well. Thanks again :)","replies":[]}]}]}
