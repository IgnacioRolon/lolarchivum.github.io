I read that in Plat/Diamond, MMR/LP starts to drain after 28 days of inactivity. Does this apply to Pre-Season in terms of MMR (I don&#039;t think LP matters but pls tell me if I am incorrect), and does this affect the next season?","replies":[{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2018-09-26T05:33:59.887+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You lose LP, and will demoted if your LP hits 0, but the decay does *not* affect your MMR to the extent of my knowledge. Your matchmaking will remain the same, only your visible rank will suffer.\n\nYou do decay in preseason yes, but placements are affected by MMR and not rank/LP so it shouldn't affect your placement next season. If you have the time to play a game though it doesn't hurt to prevent the decay. The decay is pretty brutal, and you don't have to even win to prevent it.\n\nThere's more specifics here: https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/204010760-Ranked-Play-FAQ#h3q1","replies":[]}]}
