I would like to be better at the game and would like a good supp to train me as i would like to try to main adc. My op.gg link is there so check me out. I feel as though i can improve drasticaly with the right partner. I do try and improve on things suck as positioning, cs, map awareness etc. However even when i have a good kda i still lose most of my games, which leads me to believe that i have faults that i am not realising. So thus the need for somoene \"good\" to help me see those and improve :). Thanks please send me a message and add me.","replies":[{"poster":"Maraudaur","date":"2017-03-14T12:12:36.675+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Looks like you enjoy ADC and mid\n\nIt's great that you play a lot of Jhin and ashe, you should stick to the champions you enjoy. For ADC I would highly suggest you investigate what the best players are doing in terms of \n\nwhat spells they level first\nWhat masteries they use\nwhat runes they use\nwhat items they build\n\nThis will help you get a sense of how to most effectively use the Gold you earn.\n\nIt looks like most of your games you start with a BF item.\nhttp://imgur.com/HBoA9lr.jpg\n\nIF you check here you will notice that most pros use a lethality build ({{item:3142}} {{item:3814}}  with Jhin - https://oce.op.gg/champion/jhin/statistics/adc\n\nAnd core builds on ashe do not have deaths dance - https://oce.op.gg/champion/ashe/statistics/adc\n\nFocusing on a few champions is great to master them and help you focus more on the other aspects of league of legends (positioning, rotations etc)\n\nAs for your midlane, try to stick to two champs as well and use the information available from good players to inform your builds.\n\n\nThis video should help you find everything you need to know about a specific champion - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rq3wbB_4Oa8 \nLearn from the best =D\n\nAs for some general tips, at this early stage in your LoL career it would pay to focus on the fundamentals\n\nMinion kills (CS)\nmechanics (hitting skill shots, dodging skill shots)\nGame knowledge (always be thinking why you are doing what you are doing, how does what you are doing contribute to your win)\n\nMy biggest piece of advice would be to always focus on your own game play and never autopilot. Never just go through the motions hitting that play again button. Every game your mind should be active and alert. Thinking about what went wrong, what opportunities you missed and what you could do better next time. As long as you are actively learning and thinking about each game, I have full faith that you will improve and then climb soon enough.\n\nGL HF on the Rift give us an update in a couple weeks/months time =D","replies":[{"poster":"Tafadzwa01","date":"2019-09-07T08:53:59.275+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Greetings,\nThank you for replying and forgive me as the weeks/ months you had implied have now turned into years!
