The calm grass lightly scattered along the path made it a much less tedious and painful walk for her, especially now carrying her newest friend along, a little Dragonling called&hellip;_\n\n&ldquo;R-Riggle!&rdquo; Tristana gasped, as the forked tongue of the dragonling ran across her cheek. She couldn&rsquo;t help but squeeze out a giggle. He was cute, and it kind of tickled the yordle&rsquo;s cheek.\n&ldquo;We _just_ gotta get far enough away from&hellip; that nest,&rdquo; Tristana said, spinning around and pointing at the now distant nest. &ldquo;...Before your mommy and daddy decide I&rsquo;m a decent meal for today.&rdquo;  For the first time since they&rsquo;d left the nest, Riggle stopped licking. As if he was able to understand the girl. He tried getting a better view on the nest, climbing onto Tristana&rsquo;s shoulder.\n&ldquo;Hey! W-Whoa!&rdquo; Tristana was nearly toppled by the weight of this little guy. He was so heavy for how small he was! &ldquo;Get down from there!&rdquo; She tugged him from his position, which, clearly Riggle wasn&rsquo;t too happy about. He bit her hand 'lightly', but, it was with the barely formed teeth he&rsquo;d earned from the few days he&rsquo;d been born!\nTristana&rsquo;s shrieking brought him out of his tantrum. He was ashamed, so much so that he released the grasp almost instantly, whimpering in response with a gust of steam blowing from his nose.\nTristana was mad, but, forgiving. She set Riggle down, a painful smile on her face. _That&rsquo;s gonna suck, I still needa carry this guy back home!_ She thought. &ldquo;No biting, little guy, that&rsquo;s for sure.&rdquo; Tristana&rsquo;s voice lowered to show her serious tone. &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t have ya doin&rsquo; that the whole journey home, especially when I try to keep us safe. Aight?&rdquo; Tristana spoke clearly. Even if her fingers were sore, she'd remember them as an example of what not to do to a dragon. The dragon hung his head low, knowing he was in trouble.\n\nEventually the pair learned to get along. A long journey home was complete with everything you could think of. Wild encounters with the beasts of the plains, a few bandits turned crispy, and a newfound love of fish. Riggle clearly would do anything for a fish, even breathe fire to cook &lsquo;em for Tristana herself!\n\nAt last, Tristana was on the home stretch, travelling so far from the nest of which she saved Riggle from the hardened shell prison and took him up as her own little pet. She was home! At the edge of the woods she always came back to after a hard day's hunt for food. \n\"Alright, Riggle,\" Tristana started as the thatch and wood hut she built comes into sight. It was rather well built, albeit rather small. The dragon seemed excited! Happy to see a new place to nestle in, get comfy. Tristana put him down, and he ran off. Right up to the door... But Tristana didn't follow. She'd stopped in place, looking around rather worried about the current situation. Riggle was confused, what was wrong?\nWithout warning, Tristana dashed to an open window in the side of the hut, grabbing a fishing spear made from a long stick, some fiber wrap and a large dragon's tooth.\n\"Whoever's followin' us, show yaself!\" Tristana called out.\n\nEventually, someone did reveal their... Rather strange yet shorter silhouette from the forest's woods. Another Yordle, perhaps? Tristana was most certainly intrigued. It looked like they had the large ears of a yordle, or rather, one ear. Long, wide and large on their round, large heads. And... Horns? Only one ear too... strange...\n\"Who are ya?\" Tristana called out to the figure. She couldn't trust someone following her when she had just gotten a baby dragon. \"And why are ya out this far?\" \nAs the figure stepped into the light beaming through the gaps in the pine above, it was clear what stood before Tristana. A yordle, yes, but one scarred and changed by Dragon's blood. At least that's what Tristana figured, she thought it was pretty cool to see it like that.\nHis left ear was 2 inches off missing, curled ram-like horns sprouted from his head among his hair, and he was carrying what looked like a burning hammer.\nA. Magma. Hammer. That's so cool! Tristana had to keep her cool though, he could be bad news.\n\"I'm here to make sure you're worthy.\" The black furred yordle spoke. His fur was like charcoal, his voice as deep as the abyss. \"Name's Faron.\"\nTristana tilted her head in a confused matter, matching her equally confused stare. \"You want me to what?\" She had absolutely no clue what this guy wanted. \"Listen, I'm a dragon trainer. Here's my license!\" Dropping her fishing spear, she hoisted the tiny baby dragon into the air, showing off his adorable smile, and his steaming hot belly. Tristana put him down quickly after that, as it was starting to singe her fur. Ouch. Riggle didn't seem to care nor even look in the direction of this mysterious figure, who was also pretty cool. She admits whoever he is, he has good taste for style. Footwear too!\n\nHe didn't have any. Not anything worth mentioning aside the beige wraps around his feet.\n\n\"Simple,\" Faron muttered, dropping his hammer, anchoring it to the ground as he approached the small dragon. \"Do as I am able to. Train the dragon to do as you wish.\"  Kneeling down next to Riggle, Tristana grabbed the spear back off the ground, ready to attack if he so much as scratched the scales on Riggle. She didn't trust him, but she didn't exactly keep any weapon capable of damaging anything above a salmon in the shack. She'd have to let him do his thing.\n\nFaron raised his hand in paw in front of the dragon, which, almost instantly Riggle raised his tiny front claw to hi-five him, as if understanding the gesture in an instant. Then, he stood up, and raised his hand to command Riggle. He pointed inside the shack, snapping his fingers. \"Go get it, boy!\" \nSeconds later, he darted through the door, quite literally busting the thatch construction in two as he ran **through** it. \"Riggle, wait!\" Tristana considered chasing after him, as the crashing and smashing from inside the home implied he was quite on his way to destroying half of Tristana's values. She sighed.\n\nAfter a short wait, he retrieved what appeared to be an unmarked book... Until Faron turned the first page.\n\n_\"Dragon Trainer's Field Guide.\"_\n\n\"Who in their right mind gave you this? It's **blank**!\" He rushed to find anything between the covers aside from the fancy writing on the title page. \"It's completely blank!\"\n\"Okay, enough questions.\" Tristana sighed. \"I've got one for you, how did you even make Riggle find something he's never seen!\" \n\"Didn't.\" Faron chuckled. \"I just gave him a command to fetch.\" \n\"But you didn't say a word!\" Tristana huffed. \n\"Dragons and I have a special way of... Communicating.\" He gave the book back to Riggle, who ran it over to Tristana without a second thought. It was coated in his saliva. \n\"So... you can speak to him without actually speaking?\" Tristana gave him another confused stare.\n\"And he understands me. Don't need tones, nor any whistles to get him to work. Call it cheating, if you will.\" A wide grin spread across his face, revealing his enlarged fangs: All pearly white.\n\n\"So, what you want me to do is...\" Tristana started again, seeing as this was all far too complicated for her. \"Train the dragon.\"\n\"Yes. Without dying or without having your house burn down.\" \n\"I could do it with my eyes closed!\" She replied with a cocky grin. \"And by next week!\" \nFaron raised his brow in disbelief. \"Really? Be back next week then.\" He turned to leave.\n\n\"...Wait, that was it?\" Tristana asked. \"That's all ya got for me to do?\"\n\"Yep.\" He returned to his hammer, retrieving it and slinging it over his shoulder. \"See ya.\" \nAnd like that, he was gone, back to the shadows of the woods.\n\nTristana felt like she'd forgotten something... Wait, where's riggle!?\n\nShe rushed inside the shack, stepping over the completely ruined door to find so many things wrong.\nRiggle was seated on the couch, or rather, the **ruined** couch. All the pots and pans that were before made of glass were shattered, her valued treasure was dented and upon the floor. \nIt took him 3 minutes to do all of this. It was far too much for one day for our poor trainer. The room began to spin, as did Tristana, slowly falling to the floor.\n\nRiggle was clearly worried, his trainer just passed out right before his eyes! But, he could hear her breathing, and he could see her moving in her sleep, albeit in twitches. He curled up beside her, and made himself comfy... Best friends gotta start somewhere.","replies":[]}
