Whoever plays him top, please stop. He is no good there, especially since there are such things in existence called \"tanks\". Also, most top laners in general are able to gap-close, dodge, CC, or otherwise make you regret your existence and rethink your life choices. Please, for the love of Valoran, STAY MID.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Chicken4dinner","date":"2015-05-16T14:55:41.039+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=ShuffledPancake,realm=OCE,application-id=FjGAIbRv,discussion-id=b0rLGfTo,comment-id=0000,timestamp=2015-05-16T13:30:17.833+0000)\n>\n> Dont play him top holy shit i see that so much and i wanna kms\n\nBecause being top means you are very unlikely to carry later?","replies":[{"poster":"ShuffledPancake","date":"2015-05-16T15:04:07.412+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Chicken4dinner,realm=OCE,application-id=FjGAIbRv,discussion-id=b0rLGfTo,comment-id=00000000,timestamp=2015-05-16T14:55:41.039+0000)\n>\n> Because being top means you are very unlikely to carry later?\n\nWell isnt there a little girl called riven top? also fiora jax and darius? all counters to yasuo. only play mid xD\n\nAlso renekton kayle swain etc","replies":[{"poster":"Chicken4dinner","date":"2015-05-16T15:25:43.190+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=ShuffledPancake,realm=OCE,application-id=FjGAIbRv,discussion-id=b0rLGfTo,comment-id=000000000000,timestamp=2015-05-16T15:04:07.412+0000)\n>\n> Well isnt there a little girl called riven top? also fiora jax and darius? all counters to yasuo. only play mid xD\n> \n> Also renekton kayle swain etc\n\nI thought annie was the little girl o: and yes jax can get fed top but I have only encountered him jg where he makes a great impact, I have to agree on fiora though she is a bitch if not handled correctly and darius can get really fed but he crumbles under a lot of pressure (and amour pen lol) \n\nThose last 3 never seen em fed tbh","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"sparklefart","date":"2015-05-18T01:46:06.379+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"press auto attack and then the fly ability into a windslash combo to get the ultimate pent","replies":[]},{"poster":"YongBi","date":"2015-05-17T11:00:06.316+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Well first things first, you get q.
