While I can certainly understand their reasoning behind ARURF, they kind of just forced it onto the community. At the very least, I'd like to see the occasional (maybe once a year) \"community vote\" between ARURF and traditional URF.","replies":[{"poster":"IVIemes","date":"2017-08-12T06:06:09.677+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I know right!","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Normal","date":"2017-08-12T02:28:53.666+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I agree with this tbh.

From what i've seen and herd is that people miss spamming there most loved champs in the game mode. Just free choice to play a tryhard spam no stress gamemode, try some stupid champ combos in lanes with your mates and most of all when you got to pick your champs the games were not as one sided as they are know (Based off my games)","replies":[{"poster":"cookiemuncher","date":"2017-08-16T12:17:16.104+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"When everyone is op, it balances out.","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Fitzky","date":"2017-08-12T02:40:22.122+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"YES","replies":[]}]}
