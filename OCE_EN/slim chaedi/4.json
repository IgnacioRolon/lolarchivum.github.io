Basically, one person does badly in lane and maybe dies three times and someone on the team is a jerk and reports them for feeding because of that. Or, like I had before, where I disconnected around twenty times and got reported for feeding.\r\nI find a few things ridiculous about this:\r\na) In the first case, it likely isn't intentional. We all have games likes that. Who can say they never get outplayed? People in the LCS get outplayed\r\nb) How is disconnecting and dying as a result of that in any way whatsoever intentional? Do people not understand the concept of intentional? From my point of view, people who don't want to continue playing a game probably wouldn't put in the effort required to intentionally disconnect over and over to make it not seem intentional. If anything, the fact that they have disconnected so many times should make the reports mean next to nothing if they are of that nature.\r\nc) A lot of the time people get abusive telling everyone to report a certain person. I think this is ridiculous. Like, people hate people ruining the game so they go out of their way to try and ruin the game for others? Why can't people just be civil? I'm sure we have all done badly in some games, and I'm sure we have all had connection issues. Instead of abusing the report system to the point where reports will mean less and less, I believe we should do things like hold our \"intentionally feeding\" reports for people who do things like play Master Yi with full movespeed items in order to get to lane and feed faster.\r\nThere are obviously going to be cases where people intentionally feed with a degree of sneakiness but I think there are many cases where people are obviously not feeding on purpose yet people go ahead and shout \"omg this scurb needs to not feed report\". I've had games where my jungler has been executed multiple times to jungle creeps, but I wouldn't report them because of that. They were playing and trying to do the new jungle, but failing. Although it sucked and kinda ruined the game, it isn't like they were intentionally being a dick.\r\nHere is what I say: guys, just report the people who are definitely intentionally trolling. Otherwise, our reports will mean less and less and people will be able to get away with more and more.\r\ntl;dr don't be a jerk because someone has a bad game.","replies":[{"poster":"Sackboy","date":"2014-11-30T07:07:39.146+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I report all trash players for verbal abuse, because it's almost an instant mute, It's all automated.","replies":[{"poster":"Slim Chaedi","date":"2014-11-30T07:54:30.785+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"If by trash you mean the people who are jerks on League for little to no reason, then I agree they need reporting.","replies":[{"poster":"Sackboy","date":"2014-11-30T08:48:22.254+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> If by trash you mean the people who are jerks on League for little to no reason, then I agree they need reporting.\n\nI refuse to use the word toxic, but yes I meant trash as in abusive players.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Your Neighbour","date":"2014-11-30T07:13:49.113+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> where I disconnected around twenty times and got reported for feeding.\n\nThat's because they do not trust leavebuster, people are not seeing the punishment being handed out so they want Riot to see the game by flagging as \"feeding\" so a harsher ban gets rained on you since the case will be viewed by a grumpy person that's mentally tormented by player behaviours on LoL, not the leavebuster.","replies":[]},{"poster":"SEKAI","date":"2014-11-30T04:56:48.678+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"If the report is needless the person will get pardoned.\n\nWhile if indeed guilty, a punishment will be on the way.\n\nSimple as that.","replies":[{"poster":"Slim Chaedi","date":"2014-11-30T06:15:26.206+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Although reports ought to be monitored like that anyway, I know some wrongfully made reports would slip through.
