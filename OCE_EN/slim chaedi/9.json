Not a bug in the sense that Kha’Zix is a bug, but a bug in the sense that it is an error in the League of Legends client. Truly, he is the Voidweaver.\r\n\tWeaver… of spaghetti.\r\n\tSpaghetti, long and wavy as the tentacles of a wandering Vel’Koz. Luscious, and delicious, while sometimes even with meatballs, reminiscent of a Vel’Koz eye amongst those noodle-like appendages. \r\n\tHowever, one must ask themselves why in the world – or rather, in the Void – Kha’Zix sold spaghetti. Was it to earn the cash required to buy that skin he always wished to wear, or was it for one of the many summoner icons he could not use because he is a champion, not a summoner?\r\n\tThe answer may shock you. It was… in order to feed his starving family. You see, the Void doesn’t have a very good economy, as not even the Shadow Isles wish to trade with them. In addition, Cho’Gath and Kog’Maw tend to hog all of the food! Those greedy bastards. Now you might be asking yourself why Kha’Zix didn’t just feed his family the spaghetti; well, it is simply because Kha’Zix’s family had a long history of gluten sensitivity.\r\n\tThe next question you would ask would be “Who would buy spaghetti in the Void?” Mainly Kassadin, who craved it with a raging hunger, as it reminded him of the times where he was Pre-Void Kassadin. However, he refunded that skin so he could afford his Fiora fetish skin.\r\n\tAll was well, but this became a problem around the time he joined the League of Legends.\r\n\tRito did not realise the consequences of Kha’Zix’s cultivation of spaghetti.\r\n\tKha’Zix met his arch-nemesis Rengar, King of Pizza!\r\n\tHe hated spaghetti with the Savagery of his own Q! Not only this, but he did not accept that Kha’Zix brought competition for his pizza business! He needed the money from his pizza business so he could get to full build and backdoor Red Team’s nexus.\r\n\tHis pizza business granted him a passive +5 Gold Per 10, but it had been reduced to +2. Kha’Zix had taken over half of his business!\r\n\tThis enraged Rengar. He vowed to destroy Kha’Zix to make up for the gold income he had lost. Considering Kha’Zix had been doing quite well that match, Rengar knew he would get five hundred gold for shutting him down!\r\n\tThe Hunt was on.\r\n\tMeanwhile, Shyvana, preferring lasagne, bought a Ruby Sightstone, two Vision Wards and the upgraded blue trinket so she could just watch to see how it turned out.","replies":[{"poster":"HORSE OF FORCE","date":"2014-12-06T01:37:18.471+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"This tale of epic proportions has made me re-evaluate my perspective on life.
