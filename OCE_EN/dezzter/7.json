I logged in to league today and noticed something... something life changing... among the poison that the Yordle assassin waded in swam a living George... I can only infer from this that Omega Squad Teemo when not in game is acting as a ward just off the side of the map and caught George as he fell. This news has brought wonder to my life and I felt I had to share this with my fellow Leaguers. LONG LIVE GEORGE!!!!","replies":[{"poster":"Jink","date":"2015-04-25T04:34:49.478+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"lol.","replies":[{"poster":"Jink","date":"2015-04-25T04:35:08.910+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"-","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"sparklefart","date":"2015-04-25T02:30:07.474+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"if only they were in opposite positions, and the frog was not looking","replies":[]},{"poster":"RLG Shaky","date":"2015-04-25T04:55:14.123+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"you do realise that the frog swims in front of the mine as well, but also if you look on the map in summoners rift you will find many other frogs.\n\nR.I.P George the frog \n\n_You lived a good life.\nAlways bouncing around,\nOne day you bounced\nto far and fell to your death\nlet this be a reminder to \nthe rest of the frogs out\nthere, don't drink and hop._","replies":[]}]}
