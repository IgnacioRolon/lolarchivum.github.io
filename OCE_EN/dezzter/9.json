With that change, it's clearly become a lot easier for people to start memorising what each rune does, and where they fit, as opposed to the old system where there's literally hundreds of options across the two systems. It probably also helps that pretty much everything (or even everything, I'm not sure) within the new Rune system has some clear visual aspect in-game, so you can actually figure out which Runes someone has without having to refer to external sources like op.gg","replies":[]}]}
