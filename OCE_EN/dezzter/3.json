My idea is to make his q an auto reset at point blank doing the crit, but be like ekko/hecarim e at longer ranges doing a dash auto to target. This would also make doing his combo less clunky for people with experience on pre-rework talon because the new Q being direct target spell is slowing down my combo quite a bit, at least for me it is.\n\nAlso with the removal of attackspeed from youmuus the overall pushing power of AD assassins has been reduced as well.\n\nEDIT: Not sure if this is right board for this post, was this board, GD or misc and I wasn't sure so mods feel free to move it to somewhere it suits better if needed.","replies":[{"poster":"Knuuckles","date":"2016-11-09T12:18:29.245+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"His q is a double auto reset now, it just doesn't work on turrets","replies":[{"poster":"Dezzter","date":"2016-11-09T15:23:15.834+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Yes I'm aware of that, it is likely designed so that when you hit with full w then engage with q you can apply passive straight away.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Requiemsfire","date":"2016-11-11T13:14:13.404+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I kind of miss the old Talon.
