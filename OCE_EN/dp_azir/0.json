I&#039;ve been going back and reading through the discussions over the use of the MKJogo software which allowed for many advantages over those who did not have it, one of these being Macros. These macros allowed players to send a message up to a 20 character limit with 2 keystrokes. Doing this instantly puts you in an advantage over those who don&#039;t use this, which was pointed out by a Rioter on the same thread. Now, this is where it becomes somewhat of a fine line in what is and is not acceptable, at least in my eyes. It says in the ToS that you are not allowed to use 3rd Party &quot;gear&quot;, as I&#039;m going to call it, to enhance your gameplay. This is where I am getting confused. From an owner of Razer gear, both an MMO mouse with 14 extra buttons, and a keyboard, both able to link macros to through the use of the Razer software which gets automatically installed with the connection of these devices, I&#039;m worried. With the permanent bans going to those who abused MKJogo, or even just used the macro system itself, are people with gear, not just Razer, but gear like me, also in danger? For instance, I can make a macro that can send a message 99 times in about 5 seconds, filling the in-game chat, or I can make quick phrases so that I only have to click one button and my team can know what I plan to do, or impending danger. From someone who is genuinely confused, am I also in danger of getting punished similar to the old MKJogo users? Or is it different since it is not made directly to give League players advantages?","replies":[{"poster":"SephirothSG","date":"2016-09-04T00:06:11.911+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey there,\n\nWhile I can't give you any official ruling, my understanding is that the use of macros is allowed to an extent.\n\nChat macros, etc are fine, as long as you're not doing anything silly like below.\n>send a message 99 times in about 5 seconds, filling the in-game chat\n\nI believe the only time it may become an issue is if you're macroing your abilities, etc. (Not just binding them to different keys, but actually macroing sequences)","replies":[]}]}
