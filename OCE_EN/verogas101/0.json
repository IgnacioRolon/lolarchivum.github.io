Now the application literally only grants the user an alternative cursor to replace the outdated league cursor, offline skins (skins from the game that only show up for the user), a quick message option (which sucks because it lags the game), a jungle timer which is pretty much the same as the one in game right now and some in-game recording thing... so I want to know if I should take the warning seriously or legit completely stop using the application??? P.S (just going to quote what the email said) &quot;For now, this is a warning, but continued use of the program will result in suspension placed against you, and may ultimately result in permanent account closure&quot;\r\n\r\nAdditionally, the email also said, &quot;this application automates several actions on your behalf, including chat and jungle timers.&quot; now I&#039;d like to add that in order to use the quick message you have to &quot;Ctrl+T&quot; followed by a number to select a message which isn&#039;t automated, not to mention character restriction, as it only allows 20 characters to your message at which point you realize that you just wasted 4 seconds trying to use the &quot;automated&quot; action. Now the jungle timer requires u to physically see the jungle creature die in order for the jungle timer to register which makes it 100% pointless in regards to gaining an advantage over the enemy team. So all in all, my question is should I completely remove my use of mkJogo (which I only use for the &quot;offline&quot; skins) or should I ignore the email?\r\nWrite Your Thoughts","replies":[{"poster":"Coldie","date":"2015-10-30T12:14:26.925+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Best to remove the 3rd party app. Although you may not abuse the other functions it comes with, Riot is unable to monitor if you only use the offline skins or other functions.

I can quote the post directly for the EUW forums but here. its a reply to someone asking the same question as you and luckily you got a warning and not a perma ban\n\nRiot Eambo (EUW)  - 4 months ago\n\n\"Does it interfere with the ingame experience?\" - Yes\n\"Does it provide an unfair advantage over other players without this tool?\" - Yes\n\nThere's two very simple questions that answer yours. Whether you think a feature should or should not be available, if it's not available and you're using it, it's an unfair advantage.\n\nA program that shortens the amount of work you have to do, or even that moves timers from the tab area to another area, is an unfair advantage. Other players do not have this, and it does infact give you a benefit over others - whether it's as simple as not having to press tab, or as complicated as automatically moving your character - all unfair advantages that interact with the game are just that.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"VeroGas101","date":"2015-10-30T08:30:40.810+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"bump","replies":[{"poster":"koreoes","date":"2016-02-24T19:51:10.155+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Declined (Wrecchman) (EUNE)  - 4 months ago\n\nYou actually got a warning?

So all policy is essentially guided by the following principle:\n\n**No software should interfere directly with the in-game player experience between when you press “Play” and the end of game screen.**\n\nFor more info on 3rd party app policy, check out our last message on the topic [here](http://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/miscellaneous/5kx4F7VE-reminder-third-party-applications).","replies":[{"poster":"Hairy Lobster","date":"2015-11-04T10:03:53.798+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"\"**No software should interfere directly with the in-game player experience between when you press “Play” and the end of game screen.**\"\n\n\n\nAhem..\n\n\nhttp://beta.cursevoice.com/games/league\n\n\n\n{{item:3751}} {{item:3751}} {{item:3751}} {{item:3751}} {{item:3751}} {{item:3751}} {{item:3751}} {{item:3151}}","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"VeroGas101","date":"2015-10-31T03:36:48.005+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"bump","replies":[]},{"poster":"VeroGas101","date":"2015-10-30T08:55:01.190+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"bump","replies":[]}]}
