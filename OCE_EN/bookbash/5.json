In one instance, the game was nearly over and then everyone crashed. Some returned to the game but then it crashed again and doesn&#039;t show up in history. Happened again yesterday, I get the message &quot;trying to reconnect&quot; near the end of the game. The rest of my internet is fine, no lag, no problems. \r\n\r\nAlso in custom games, its taking forever to select a bot champion in the team select.","replies":[]}
