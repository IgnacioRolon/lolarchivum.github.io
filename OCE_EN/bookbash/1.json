Don't do it. Not all champs can afford to have a black cleaver. But even if you do, the odds are that they have more armour anyways (their tanks). Plus once their mages have a seekers they can teamfight you already and then once they are ahead its gg.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Early Feed Strat","date":"2015-08-06T13:07:44.886+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You should't get caught up on other players poor decision making but it is good to realize them and use that knowledge to better yourself.

And it was the opposition team that were flaming Nidalee, so yeah she could just use the mute and continue the game. I mean they are winning the game, regardless of the score. And that's the whole point. Bronze need to learn strategy to understand power spikes, item builds, and learn not to surrender in winning positions and have more tenacity by thinking about the TEAM not just themselves.","replies":[{"poster":"Early Feed Strat","date":"2015-08-07T02:16:55.610+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Bookbash,realm=OCE,application-id=FjGAIbRv,discussion-id=bjljsWB3,comment-id=00010000,timestamp=2015-08-06T15:35:49.532+0000)\n>\n> Firstly this post is for bronze to educate themselves, not for me.

They could work on their teamwork and understanding of the game.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}
