Spent most of the time in Bronze 5, after being initially placed in Bronze 1. The ranked scene seems to have settled down now, with most jackers filtering into the bottom of Bronze 5 like they should be.\r\n\r\nIdeally you&#039;d have to be good in ranked (i.e. KDA over 3 at least). I&#039;ve duoed with a few adcs but most bronze adcs are either scared pussies, or are constantly chasing kills instead of farming. With my last adc we climbed two divisions but while I was offline they climbed another 2 and then sitting on 0 LP they told me &quot;I don&#039;t want to duo right now, I HAVE to win this game, I might lose!&quot;.\r\n\r\nI need an adc who&#039;s sick of supports that don&#039;t peel, don&#039;t ward, do stupid engages etc. I&#039;m not one of those, I only care about OBJECTIVES. If you are actually good at the game and stuck in elo hell, let&#039;s duo.\r\n\r\nBe warned though, I will check you out beforehand :)","replies":[{"poster":"Bookbash","date":"2015-09-07T16:56:24.708+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Bumperino.

Back to Bronze 3 atm. Had a bunch of noob teams all week. A classic bronze play is when the opposition are all AD composition apart from their support, our team feeds and doesn't rush armour items.\n\nLooking for s4+ ADC if possible.
