Then I got paired up to a Plat 5. I had no problem with versing him I just thought it was a little weird for a level 3 account with no normal history due to being forced to play bots till level 3 could get paired with a plat 5. Seems unbalanced for any player who was legitimately new.","replies":[{"poster":"IngÃ©nue","date":"2014-12-16T02:53:28.405+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"When you created your new account did you select beginner, veteran or expert? If you selected beginner there is no way you would be paired up with plats, but maybe if you picked veteran or expert (but surely not until higher levels). Maybe the plat was duo que? Even then, that is ridiculous, a level 3 with 3 mastery points and no runes against a level 30.","replies":[{"poster":"MadLifeJunior","date":"2014-12-16T03:17:19.707+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=yaiamone,realm=OCE,application-id=FjGAIbRv,discussion-id=GZoeTjTJ,comment-id=0002,timestamp=2014-12-16T02:53:28.405+0000)\n>\n> When you created your new account did you select beginner, veteran or expert?
