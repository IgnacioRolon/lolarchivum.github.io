On behalf of the Oceanic community of League of Legends I would like to suggest a rework on the colour scheme you have implemented with the 'Boards'. It is in my understanding and/or belief that the current colour scheme for boards is designed to keep in with the ominous atmosphere of League of Legends, as demonstrated by the existing background image. \r\n\r\nIn all honesty, it is the current colour scheme that is the downfall of the boards and a major contributing factor to the low numbers and general distaste of boards over the old forums. Reworking the colour scheme to a more 'inviting' colour selection could potentially alter the current opinion of boards for many Oceanic League of Legends forum goers. \r\n\r\nKind Regards, \r\nlols","replies":[{"poster":"Lord Kylar Alice","date":"2014-11-20T00:25:46.610+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The colour scheme is nice.","replies":[{"poster":"MadLifeJunior","date":"2014-11-20T00:35:29.266+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"But it's so dark!","replies":[{"poster":"Lord Kylar Alice","date":"2014-11-23T02:17:41.574+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> But it's so dark!\n\nPoint?","replies":[]},{"poster":"Klavinmour","date":"2014-11-20T01:00:18.136+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"That's what makes it good!","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Maraudaur","date":"2014-11-20T01:06:58.576+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"There was a Q&A done a while ago which you can find [here](http://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/GD/ITeMWouf-boards-qa-recap)\n\nBut I think the most relevant to your question lols is the below excerpt:\n\n**Hex Ghost**: “What are your plans to recolor this board?”\n\n**Sweet**: “Although there may be minor alterations to the color scheme, overall there won't be huge changes in the near term. Let me highlight some reasons why and the thought process behind it.\n\n* **Minimizing attention to an application/platform and maximizing focus on content (images, media, formatted text)** In general, individuals focus on brighter areas on darker backgrounds and dark themes bring forth focus on content instead of the overall platform and its window.\n\n* **The color of the text in combination with the background color is actually very purposeful as there is research around the best combination of colors.** The two best being light non-white background with off-gray text and dark blue/black backgrounds with yellow text. The latter pulling slightly ahead for web. The common thought is that white background + black text is best however this is due largely in part to the legacy of how we as a society transitioned from print, magazines to web, digital. It can take some getting used to however as we are very accustomed to black on white text and it has therefore created a very real preference bias.\n\n* **In dark environments, light backgrounds can strain the eyes especially in low light environments.**\n\n* **Accessibility is of high priority and concern to us.** Some individuals have eye-sight problems and can only read high contrast text. Light on dark is higher contrast than dark on light for them. It's about finding a balance though and we are still striving to find the perfect combination.”\n\n**Bear Hat Alice** added to Sweet’s answer: “To add to what Riot Sweet said, while we have no plans to support multiple color schemes in the near future you are able to take control of your browser and override our color schemes. You can create a user stylesheet for the boards using a browser extension like Stylish for Firefox or Stylebot for Chrome and recolor the boards to your liking.”","replies":[{"poster":"Klavinmour","date":"2014-11-20T01:32:44.893+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Now if only I could upvote this.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Klavinmour","date":"2014-11-19T23:02:53.567+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'm rather picky when it comes to colour schemes, considering I am losing my eye sight.
