I've noticed a lot of players, and I mean a lot trying to flash this. I tried it once too.\r\n\r\nI just thought it's pretty funny when someone does.\r\n\r\nRegards,\r\nlols =)","replies":[{"poster":"BarryButcher","date":"2014-11-25T05:17:32.525+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"No but people don't know you can't. just say, its flashable and see how many people try.\n\nWhat is interesting is you can TP to a turret at 20seconds and maintain the start game movespeed bonus... someone smarter then me can figure out a way to use that to your advantage","replies":[]},{"poster":"MadLifeJunior","date":"2014-11-24T22:58:09.022+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Nope.","replies":[]},{"poster":"P1 GTR","date":"2014-11-24T22:57:45.856+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Can you flash it?
