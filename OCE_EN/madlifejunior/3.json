Whilst I have suggested the idea of having friends who meet the requirements for gifting gift you the skin you are after and then repaying them once you have access to League again I strongly believe there needs to be an external game store. A store that allows you to purchase in game content whilst not actually having to be logged into League of Legends. I bring this up now because there is the Beta Merchandise store. \r\n\r\nWhat do you guys think about having access to an external game store?","replies":[{"poster":"BarryButcher","date":"2014-12-19T09:41:12.840+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Could be useful for people who can't log in to the client could use their phone or tablet to take advantage of a sale.\nBut its a lot of work for a very niche group of people.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Knuuckles","date":"2014-12-19T02:29:28.372+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"a lot of unnecessary coding and implementation would go to waste to put a store feature on the website and honestly why should they","replies":[]}]}
