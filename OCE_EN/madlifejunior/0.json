I was in Martin Place a couple hours prior to the event. \r\n\r\nI would like to express my sincerest sympathies to the victims of the Sydney Siege. In light of this dark time, I believe Australia and the world as a whole will only get stronger. You can already see this through the #illridewithyou and #prayforsydney spreading like wild fire. As names have not been released yet of the victims deceased and living I give my best to anyone who may know them. \r\n\r\nRest in Peace! Prosper!","replies":[{"poster":"FauxSho","date":"2014-12-15T22:52:46.784+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"I feel for the victims families and friends...\nI cannot imagine the horror they went through.\n\nBut I'll just remind again for anyone who wishes to spread a discriminatory message, such as \"Send them all back to their country\". A minority should never set the stereotype for a group.\n\nWith that out of the way, I truly hope this is all that there is, and that this is not just a side story for a bigger target during our holiday period.\nThe amount of stories popping up about possible new years plans is a little frightening although complete speculation.\n\nRest in Peace. May we grow stronger as a nation because of the hardship you faced.","replies":[]},{"poster":"kirito666","date":"2014-12-16T04:59:26.542+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":3,"body":"It's our bloody fault at the same time. We took way too long to handle the %%%%ing situation. We should have had the guy killed HOURS WAY BEFORE it was ended. 16 hours is way too %%%%ing long man... It could of been dealt with way before that.\n\nHe was already known by the police, he went to court several times. He should have been in jail, but no the court was %%%%%%ed and let him go. He threatened many people from the country he was from (death threats). Higher people in the community also reported him serveral times too. If he was in jail none of this would of happened.","replies":[{"poster":"xZarahsx","date":"2014-12-16T05:33:54.203+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"Yeah..Good idea. Blame the police. Considering you have no idea if that backpack was a bomb, if there was more than one man in there, whether the bomb threats in other buildings were true, whether he had a device on him.\n\nDON'T BLAME THE POLICE, THEY WERE ONLY BEING CAUTIOUS. \n\nIf anything, the hostages escaping ruined any plans to get them all out safely..\n\nAs for the courts and him being locked up, I agree. I only hope now the courts will learn from this.\n\nMy thoughts are with all who have been affected by the tragedy, I'm in utter shock. Rip to the two victims and may the nutcase burn in hell. My condolences go out to all of the family and friends.\n\n#RipSydneyHostages #Iwillridewithyou","replies":[{"poster":"Justify","date":"2014-12-16T06:53:17.942+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"tbh this man wouldn't of let them leave, he wanted to inflict as much harm as possible before being killed. should be thankful he didn't decide to plant bombs in populated areas, or just blow himself up in the middle of a crowd.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"420 Afgooey","date":"2014-12-16T06:01:40.064+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"A true tragedy, R.I.P  :(","replies":[]},{"poster":"Nature","date":"2014-12-15T22:35:21.850+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"R.I.P Martin Place VIctims.

Global goddamn peace is unachievable when there are cowards out there who kills others with devices such as bombs, all for the sake of their religion and beliefs? That sort of trash has strayed so far from its original purpose that it can't even be self justified anymore, it's just an excuse to kill innocent people. I mean sure there are people out there who just want to live a peaceful life like the rest of us but when you get as many terrorists out of the one country as some the Middle Eastern countries, DO SOMETHING ABOUT IT goddammit, it's unacceptable to have these people brainwashed by their religion and to go so far as suicide bombing.
