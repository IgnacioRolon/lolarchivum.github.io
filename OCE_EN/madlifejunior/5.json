I created a thread a while back on the old forums which was essentially like a diary. A thread that would continually get updated with the daily achievements I had made on League. e.g. achieving X amount of League Points or completing promos etc. That said I was unable to continue updating as time went on. But with the BOARDS I want to try and resurrect my old thread here.\r\n\r\n**So the point of this thread is just to post any achievements you have achieved each day no matter how big or how small. **\r\n\r\nMost recently I played a game as Karma jungle after seeing Diamondprox do it. It went pretty well. \r\n\r\nOn to you.\r\nlols =)\r\n\r\nNote: OPGG still hasn't updated its champion and items databases. No Kalista or new Jungle items listed.","replies":[{"poster":"Zaps","date":"2014-11-25T04:31:05.770+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Woo, Karma Jungle! How does she feel in the new Jungle?

But still wanted to try it. I got my friends to give me a double leash on Wolves then Blue Buff. So that made it easier. Build wise I went with the jungle item that provides smite bonuses in regards to actual jungling as opposed to smiting champions etc. I then built it into the AP item. Following I built a Liandrys and Sorcerers boots. After that I just build tank. I basically built how I would on Elise. \n\nGood luck ZAPS, update me when you next give her a go.","replies":[{"poster":"Zaps","date":"2014-11-25T05:22:11.880+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"> Good luck ZAPS, update me when you next give her a go.\n\nI'll have to give it a try - seems like the build is pretty similar to the old-style of Jungle Karma, so hopefully the clears aren't too painful!","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"BrbDoingWraiths","date":"2014-11-24T06:04:06.630+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Janna game for last week, got my Vayne ADC a penta.\n*","replies":[{"poster":"MadLifeJunior","date":"2014-11-24T10:04:14.217+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> Janna game for last week, got my Vayne ADC a penta.\n> *\n\nVery awesome {{champion:40}} !
