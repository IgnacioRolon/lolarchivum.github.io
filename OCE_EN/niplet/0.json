Vision is too important.\nSwap your trinket to a sweeper when your support item upgrades to a sightstone.\nYour runes look good, i would personally go Aery over Comet but its fine.\nUsually Zhonya's is the only AP item you build on Morg Support. You mainly want utility/tank items after that. Definitely not void staff.\nMorg support also level their Q first for longer root duration and E second to increase shield strength.\nThe 2 above points make me think you want to do more damage than Morg realistically should be putting out. There are plenty of AP mages out there you can use instead of Morg like Brand or Zyra if you want to do more damage.\n\nBefore going into ranked you need to ask youself a few questions:\n\n1. Do you know how to play EVERY role? Although you play support, there is always the chance to get auto-filled to every position so make sure you know how to play every role.\n\n2. Learn 2-3 champs per role in case your champion gets picked by the enemy or banned.\n\n3. Know how EVERY champion in the game works. I don't expect you to know all the cooldowns and mana costs, just understand how a champion works and how they do damage so you can avoid it when you play against it.\n\n4. Get 150 normal wins. It just helps in developing your understanding of how the game works. Your normal win/loss record is 43-84, which isn't great.\n\nIf your going to main support, i would suggest duo'ing with an ADC. either a friend or just add a good ADC you meet in your games. Makes life a lot easier.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Broken Scripts","date":"2018-04-06T10:32:25.580+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"Just play ranked.

But also be humble and listen to constructive criticism or suggestions in game. Question them and review your games to see what that player meant, and if it was the right call. Also when you rewatch your games, you might see things that you can improve on in your gameplay that you didn't spot before. Constructive critism is good, but mute other stupid criticism. Differentiate between the two and don't let ego get in the way of becoming a better player.","replies":[{"poster":"Niplet","date":"2018-04-30T02:24:13.433+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"cheers","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"SovietStalin","date":"2018-04-10T14:09:51.854+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You would fit right in bronze 5 with me","replies":[{"poster":"Niplet","date":"2018-04-30T02:23:51.377+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"i got silver 4...","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Niplet","date":"2018-04-08T10:00:36.393+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thanks for all your advice and help guys.
