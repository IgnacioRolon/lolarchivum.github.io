Most played champ would be Morgana. I haven&#039;t played any ranked games yet as i&#039;m not that confident. Would anyone be able to look at my games and tell me if its worth trying to play ranked yet and/or what elo i would be in roughly.\r\n\r\nAny advice is also welcome :)\r\n\r\n\r\nCheers in advance","replies":[{"poster":"Wuks","date":"2018-04-07T08:26:34.268+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I took a look at your OP.GG profile, and it looks like you've been running into players across the spectrum from low Bronze to Silver. While it's difficult to correlate normals data to ranked performance, my best guess based on limited data is that you may end up somewhere in Bronze. \n\nWhether or not you feel like you're ready for ranked is up to you! Ranked is a completely separate queue, and you may find the competition to be stiffer and the stakes to be higher. While grinding ranked games to climb may be best suited for some players, perfecting skills in normals may be best for others. However, you'll never know where you're at until you try. Best of luck regardless of whatever you decide :)","replies":[]}]}
