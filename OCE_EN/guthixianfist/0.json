A lot of popular champions don't use mana.\n2. Most of the time there won't be a point in the game where your team will desperately need to get a ton of mana back which makes the spell pointless unless you're mucking around and playing a complete siege comp that will just spam continuously.\n3. Other spells can be used more often and for greater value like TP, Ignite, Cleanse, Heal, Barrier, Flash.\n4. Even if you're playing a hardcore siege comp, it's likely that most of your team will be AP, which means they can just buy Grail instead.\n\nGrail and Scrying Orb are both better than Clarity/Clairvoyance.\n\nOh jk, they removed Scrying Orb.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"guthixianfist","date":"2015-11-12T03:16:56.002+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"I use clairvoyance when i play lux support for things like stealing buffs/drags/barons it works very well when you don't wanna risk invading but your team gave your blue to the mid and you want one to you just time using it correctly and easy blue buff. also map aware ness eg checking where enemy is leashing to attempt a potential invade on there opposite jg.

Permanent vision won't work. Perhaps a temporary mark that applies to anyone spotted and increases allied movement speed/damage towards those marked?\n\nSpells aren't picked by a majority because they're not as good as other spells. It's a rare (and I mean practically never) case in which clarity is better to take over Ignite, TP, Heal, Barrier, Exhaust etc.\n\nAs for your point about removing champions, that's a completely different concept. Champions can be actively nerfed/buffed/reworked or the meta can shift to support them because they're far more diverse and flexible than spells.","replies":[{"poster":"Nemmesis2","date":"2016-10-29T09:07:35.780+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It doesn't matter whats better to take over anything.    It was about choice and  customization.     If your just gonna remove things that don't work best IN YOUR OPINION,  why not just remove them all,  why make us choose summoner spells and just chose them for us?   You OBVIOUSLY KNOW BEST.   and MY OPINION doesn't count.    Make all tanks come standard with heal and  exhaust,   make all adc come standard with heal, barrier...   What are you trying to prove by giving us less options to customize how WE WANT TO PLAY.\n\nWhy make us pick items as well...   just auto shop for us cause it's WHATS BEST IN YOUR OPINION.\n\nClairvoyance was a major common spell for me to use.   it eliminated my need to wander thru the jg or river and get caught out trying to place a ward when i had NO clue where they were.\n\nClarity...   Came in great for a little longer lane presence on mana hungry characters like Panth, or Galio or Nasus.   Now instead of this spell  I find myself buying a dorans ring as first item on panth when i need the extra poke.   WHO THE HELL DOES THAT????     i do.    cause I find having extra mana fita my play style better than ignite or teleport.","replies":[{"poster":"Cakemeisting","date":"2016-10-30T03:54:01.161+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"This exactly, Nemmesis2.
