(i'm Plat V now btw)\n\nDepends what order your wins/losses come in and also you are pretty much required to do really well in order to hold your division.\n\nYou can roughly guess where you will be placed when you look at the rank of your opponents and teammates.\n\nIn your placement games you lost the games against Silver V's and won the games with Bronze IV's and III's. You can't really afford to lose your Silver level MMR games when doing placements. But hey, if you're a Silver player, Bronze should be easy as Pie to 1v5 carry","replies":[{"poster":"ItsNotMagic","date":"2015-09-08T23:16:16.909+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yeah im in silver promos now :pp","replies":[{"poster":"ItsNotMagic","date":"2015-09-08T23:15:58.315+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"changed my name..","replies":[]}]}]}]}
