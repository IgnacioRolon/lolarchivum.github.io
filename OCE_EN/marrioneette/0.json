I got to loading screen smoothly but after this my screen went black but I could hear all the noises of the game. I thought that was strange as I couldn't get out of the black game screen to my normal comp desktop doing everything from ult tabbing to going to the log out screen. So I restarted my computer and promptly restarted my LoL and logged back into the game probably 2/3minutes in. Like I said we won, however when I went into the post game screen I had a warning that I wasn't allowed to leave games? Just wondering why I got this message as I re-logged into the game instantly and played the last 15 mins. There is something wrong with my comp/client etc but I dont understand why I got this warning???","replies":[{"poster":"HORSE OF FORCE","date":"2015-03-04T10:06:57.340+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":">logged back into the game probably 2/3minutes in\n\nThis would definitely not be considered to be \"leaving a game\". This was the in-game time you're talking about, yes?","replies":[{"poster":"Marrioneette","date":"2015-03-04T20:10:52.541+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"to be honest it could have been longer, when i did get ingame i was level 6 and i think my team was level 9/10 so i guess it could have been? how long does it count to get a \"leaving a game\" penalty? like 5 mins?","replies":[{"poster":"HORSE OF FORCE","date":"2015-03-06T04:06:26.505+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The threshold is five minutes, yes.\n\nIf you were level six when you re-entered, then it was probably far further than five minutes in.","replies":[]}]}]}]}
