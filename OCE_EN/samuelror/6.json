LoL's matchmaking system is only balanced if you play an obscene amount of games. The matchmaking will literally give you free-win and free-losses depending on a few factors, and you have to play a shit ton to locate yourself to your true elo. Problem is, not everyone has that kind of time, the result is that for those who plays casually it can feel like the system is rigged (as it kinda is, in a sense); and for those who often run into bad matchups because matchmaking says so, they have this impression of elo hell as a result.\n2. Smurfs. When some high elo has got sick with their long queues, that they want to feel good about themselves, or that they want to do the stream gimmicks, they will smurf. These guys partially created the elo hell because they're just not supposed to be there, and ruined the matchmaking balance even further.\n3. In high elo matches, most players have their own competency in some areas, and other players can usually trust them in the task they're assigned to, or expect them to react in a certain way that can contribute to the team's victory and mitigating the chances of losing, in other words, high elo players cooperate by defeault; this doesn't happen in low elo. Low elo players are not coordinated and they rarely cooperate organically/intuitively, sometimes at all. And this creates the situation that it's far more easily to lose a game because of someone's mis-action or in-action, missed the win due to your good play not being followed up, losses from someone's refusal to suggestions and such, and other random things one have no control, or very little of it, over. This creates the impression of elo hell.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Lord Sesshomaru","date":"2017-05-28T05:13:52.168+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"While I wont argue that 'Elo Hell' is a concrete thing, and that it's some unescapable limbo.\n\nI will say, that I believe there is some truth to the theory behind it.\n\nLeague is a team game, we are told this from day 1. \nSo it's only natural that you cannot be 100% responsible for your wins.\nMeaning that your team does have _some_ weighting on the overall outcome, wether it's good or bad.\n\nSo in theory, the worse your team, the more your personal impact on the game is reduced.\nTherefore, you are less likely to climb in ranks that have an excess of people who are less versed in the art of League.\n\nI am 100% sure that Faker would have a harder time climbing out of Bronze, than he would climbing out of Gold. Purely because as it is a team game, his personal impact on the game is lessened when all the other lanes feed or make bad decisions. _(no one can 1v5 all game, so you always have to lean on your team at some point)_\n\nThat being said, if you are in 'Elo Hell', as it is described, and all 9 other players were terrible, and you were the only good one. Your team would have the advantage, so you would in theory, still climb.\n\nSo do I believe it is unescapable? No.\nDo I believe it is harder to climb in bronze than in other ranks. Yes.\n\nAs a silver player _(who has been in bronze for several seasons before)_, in my experience, Silver is actually easier than Bronze. I feel like I have more impact on the game than I did when I was in lower Bronze.\nPeople have greater knowledge of the game, so games seem to be less snowbally and you are more likely to pull a game back, meaning mistakes made by either yourself or your team mates are often less punishing to the overall game. \nThis is just my personal experience however, and I have no statistics to back it up.\n\nSo no, I don't believe in an unescapable 'Elo Hell' where your zombie teammates drag you down forever, your own skill does definitely count for something! But as a team game, I don't believe it as simple as you state.\n\n_______\n\nWhat about support mains? A fed Nami isn't going to hyper-carry all her games to victory the same way a fed Riven would.\n\nIt doesnt matter how good she is, Nami has to rely much more on her team than a Riven or a Darius, so in theory, a team of bad players would affect Nami's rank much more than it would other champions.\n\nSo to say _\"if you aren't climbing, it's only your fault.\"_ may be more fair if you are referring to Master Yi or Katarina players. But poor Nami and Janna players can't just up and 1v3 the enemy team when fed, so they have to rely on other players for damage. So naturally they will be affected more when their team cant perform as well as they can.","replies":[{"poster":"FatedSaviour","date":"2017-05-31T10:54:16.491+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"i once had a draven say sion support isnt real, then go on to troll (\"ap draven is as legit as sion support\")\nELO HELL\ni once had a teamate say he was going to afk cuz he wanted to stay bronze\nELO HELL\nhad literally every lane have at least 2 times more deaths than kills and lost first tower except my own (as support) and they kept going to die\nELO HELL\nit happens, its not a certainty, its not consistent (unless your felling happy about the game for once) wether its there is not, is up to other people to agree with you on, if they dont, beleive it if you want","replies":[]},{"poster":"HashTagNoodles","date":"2017-05-28T06:29:45.164+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Unless that janna or nami go ad ;') then hell yes to try and carry.","replies":[{"poster":"FatedSaviour","date":"2017-05-31T10:50:31.546+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"its time for their time to shine","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Akkordian Zoeve","date":"2017-05-28T08:41:29.829+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> A fed Nami isn&#x27;t going to hyper-carry all her games to victory the same way a fed Riven would.\n\nI don't know...
