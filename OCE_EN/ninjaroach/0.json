It says dealing 22%-33% damage per second. Who is going to stay on her soil for more than 2 secs? please change to what it used to be which is dealing 11%-33% per half sec. Otherwise riot you just making this game worse. so unfair on Morgana main players. She used to be more viable and good at mid lane. I&#039;ve run some experience, I only done 2/3 damage per game in comparison to I used to play as Morgana. Please consider change her tormented soil back.{{champion:25}}","replies":[{"poster":"Rocka","date":"2015-12-02T16:17:03.122+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"you have your binding to keep them locked on it.......","replies":[{"poster":"Roguestoney","date":"2015-12-02T20:31:48.161+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Rocka,realm=OCE,application-id=FjGAIbRv,discussion-id=4vqOrPEQ,comment-id=0000,timestamp=2015-12-02T16:17:03.122+0000)\n>\n> you have your binding to keep them locked on it.......\n\nThis...","replies":[]},{"poster":"Ing√©nue","date":"2015-12-03T00:55:56.462+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"This is also why the binding duration is so long.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Lady","date":"2015-12-03T00:43:06.025+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I feel like she hasn't had any changes like the ones you're talking about.\nr u alright?","replies":[]}]}
