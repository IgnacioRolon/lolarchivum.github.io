No one was working together due to the low elo and suddenly 4 people on my team decided they didn&#039;t want to play anymore. I couldn&#039;t believe it. Do you guys agree people surrender too easily?","replies":[{"poster":"Socio","date":"2016-01-18T05:56:49.884+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"How about they just remove the surrender feature?

I dont mind surrenders in normals, but in ranked 20mins is way too short for most games to be decided in low elo","replies":[]},{"poster":"CHEESYLEEKS","date":"2016-01-18T03:58:05.219+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":1,"body":"people in the games i play never surrender and usually waste an extra 15-20 minutes on an unavoidable loss.","replies":[{"poster":"Essembie","date":"2016-01-18T22:08:42.127+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"This. \n\nSome games can be recovered.

Great K/D/A based on the circumstances? Did a fantastic job with my CS this match? Wow, this other person was actually pretty good and I could learn from them? These views don't exist and it's a sad element of the game.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Bytez","date":"2016-01-18T06:12:17.174+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I don't like the fact of surrendering in Ranked either. Sure in Norms I can find it somewhat understandable, but in Ranked I don't see the point. I'm not going to say that I've never surrendered because that would be a lie, and I can agree that games do become frustrating sometimes, but the fact remains that **anything can happen**. A game isn't set in stone just because a team has a few more towers or kills, the game is truly decided when a team gives up.","replies":[]},{"poster":"voidscythe","date":"2016-01-20T02:21:48.819+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Sometimes people try and predict the game ahead, cannot see a win, and 3 other people agree, so they surrender.
