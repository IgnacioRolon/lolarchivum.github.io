I was in the game at the beginning up until the disconnection. I disconnected once in around the 25 minute mark and then reconnected in 26 minutes. Again disconnected around the 28 minute mark and then reconnected soon after. At the last few minutes of the game, I did a sick engage with riven and then won the team fight. Again did another play getting myself a quadra kill. At the end of the game I receive a very nice message saying that I was afk and I got a priority queue. I don&#039;t want to spend a whole hour trying to get rid of this priority so I was thinking if you guys could perhaps remove it or if you could fix the problem or something. What is also weird, is that, my internet can sometimes disconnect and reconnect through ranked games and I wouldn&#039;t normally get a leaverbuster, but for some reason it happened this time?","replies":[{"poster":"Project Xayah","date":"2018-08-17T11:01:13.945+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"To be clear, Low Priority Queues will never be overturned, as stated on the [LeaverBuster FAQ Support Page](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752714) (yes, even if you managed to pull off some great plays).\n\nIf you don't normally receive LPQs for the consistency of your DCs, it may be that they've become more frequent more recently, or that you hadn't yet reached a point where LeaverBuster would normally trigger. I can't really even guess at why it happened with this particular instance without knowing a lot more about your recent DC activity, and even then I'd just be hazarding an educated guess more than anything.\n\nIf you find that you have connection issues too frequently, I'd recommend you head over to the [Troubleshooting Connection Issues Support Page](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664), read through that and try some of the suggested *potential* solutions. If it's an issue with your ISP, you're probably better off just contacting them to deal with it sooner rather than later, as at least then you might not have to deal with them for a while.","replies":[]}]}
