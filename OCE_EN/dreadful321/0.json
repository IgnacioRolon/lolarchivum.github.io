So i just played a ranked flex game as Ekko and the ending didn&#039;t really go out too well. I went 13/3/11 but throughout the game I have also disconnected around 3 times, once at the beginning, once at the 12 - 18 minute mark and another at the 20 - 24 minute mark. But after 25 mins I stopped disconnecting and I was good to go. We started to win and my team was at the nexus turrets. I died and disconnected (not on purpose) at the end of the game and at the lobby screen after the game finished it said: LEAVER 2 of 10 GAMES. It was weird as well because I was playing with my brother: LMFA031  and he didn't get the same thing i got. wut? riot pls.\nHere's what it looked like:\nhttps://imgur.com/a/gspAK","replies":[{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2018-01-24T04:31:46.975+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You said yourself you disconnected multiple times for what sounds like a reasonably significant amount of time, hence you counted as a leaver instead of getting a win.

I find it odd as well because i was playing with my brother and he did not get the leaver.","replies":[{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2018-01-24T06:09:49.918+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Being afk for a significant period of time at *any* stage of the game will get you a leaver, it doesn't have to be the end.

So I'm just confused as to why I got a leaver while my brother did not, even though he disconnected at the end and at every other time that I had disconnected from the game.","replies":[{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2018-01-25T02:28:30.676+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"In that case I can only assume it was borderline times and his computer loads faster.

So the problem was that his computer had loaded faster than mine which made me get the leaver, which sucks. F-*k this computer lol.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Aggressive Ward","date":"2018-01-24T03:23:47.522+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I had discount issue as well during a solo and duo ranked game, i was in a champion selecting and i can not ban any champ or pick any champ so i got the leaver buster thing for 5 minutes like wtf","replies":[]}]}
