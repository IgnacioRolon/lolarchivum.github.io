If not using an uninstall app for mac to completely while the game from the computer.\nAlso go into Go in finder at the top >press option on keyboard> Click Library find LoL and delete that folder.\n\nNow completely re download the client and update OSX.,\n\nI bet it will work again! ;)\n~Reported4Verbal~ OCE~  Always Happy To Help! :)\nARAM Main!
