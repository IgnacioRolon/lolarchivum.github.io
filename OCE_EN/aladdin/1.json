Here's where I can help.\n\nThe use of music to synergise with visuals has always been one of my favorite things in video creation. It feels like this is where the aim was, but not necessarily what happened. The cuts were a little bit out of sync with the music, so they didn't have the desired effect. This is something that practice can help with.\n\nThe use of the camera tool was nice, but I'd suggest looking in to key framing, to allow smoother transitions and camera panning. It will take a lot more time to set up for game capturing, but you'll see a change in quality of cinematics, which should make the editing easier, and more fun.\n\nIf you want more advice on Content Creation or Video Editing, feel free to throw me an add on LoL, and I'll be happy to teach you what I know. ( 8~ years video editing, though self taught, so not a professional )\n\nSidenote; something I did, as an example.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7hRFU3_ap1Y\n\n~J","replies":[]},{"poster":"JasonWazza","date":"2015-09-06T15:22:56.585+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I enjoy getting epilepsy from watching youtube videos.","replies":[]}]}
