I don&#039;t know if this is intentional or a bug, but I just thought I&#039;d report it.\nOther than that, everything that's available works fine so far. Although, my friends have told me that it just keeps saying that I'm in game even after I'm done with a game.

If I set my status to Away, it should stay that way until I change it myself.","replies":[]}]}
