I looked through my match history to see what might have caused this; keep in mind that I do not play regular league anymore, just TFT so this really came as a surprise to me; and in my match history I saw a ranked game as Gnar even though I've been out all day.\r\n\r\nI've sent a ticket to Riot but they said nothing can be done about it?\r\n\r\nI've also looked through the boards and a lot of people have been facing the same issue, but a lot of them managed to get it resolved. This doesn't really make sense to me as I:\r\n\r\n1) Don't play ranked games: I've probably played around 10 ranked games in my 6 or 7 years of league, but find normal games with friends more enjoyable\r\n2) Don't play Gnar as I'm more of a mid/jg player\r\n3) Stopped playing regular league a few months ago and only came back because of TFT.\r\n\r\nIs there any way I can get the ban lifted? Would appreciate any help. Thanks :))","replies":[{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2019-09-01T09:42:53.705+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Did you mention that you had been compromised in the ticket or did you just contest the ban? If you just contested the ban they probably would have checked that 3rd party cheats were used, and when the answer was yes that's what they told you since cheating bans are serious business.\n\nAt any rate:\n\n1. Change the password on your account.\n2. Change the password of the email attached to the account.\n3. Change the password for any accounts that used the same password as your League one.\n4. Run an anti-virus scan, ideally one that will detect keyloggers (like Malwarebytes).\n5. Reply to the ticket:\n\nLink the match history of the game in question and explain that you didn't play it. They will usually prompt you to log out of support and submit an account recovery ticket to verify ownership. \n\nYou'll get asked a bunch of questions. You don't have to answer all, but you do have to answer most. If you feel you're missing a lot of answers, any information that is unique to the account but not visible on the account is helpful. (E.G \"I bought x skin the day after it's release\" is helpful, while \"I have this skin on my account\" is not.)\n\nOnce ownership of the account and the compromise is verified, you will usually have the account restored, however, there are scenarios that will result in you not getting the account back.\n\nRiot can only protect you from *external* compromise. If you have a room-mate or sibling who played on the account from your computer/location, they have no way of verifying that it wasn't you playing and so the punishment will stick.\n\nIf you have ever willingly shared your account, you lose a lot of the protections and verification means that a fully secure account has, and so the punishment may stick. It's worth noting that account sharing itself is against the ToS and can result in loss of the account, but it isn't typically punished unless it is being used maliciously or unfairly.","replies":[]}]}
