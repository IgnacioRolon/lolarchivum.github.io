WHEN IS URF, it had been a full rotation now and still no urf WHY? To be honest, Riot, stop wasting time designing shit game modes. Honestly the only 2 game mode the community needs the URF, ONE FOR ALL, these modes are the true definition of fun{{sticker:slayer-jinx-catface}} . Game modes such as: definitely not dominion, nemesis draft, legend of the poro king ( not much difference to Aram), Nexus Siege( kinda alright, it gets bored as well). No offense riot, stop releasing to league of legend, these modes are aids, cancer {{champion:17}} {{summoner:3}} and shit, WE WANT URF,URF,URF, how hard is it?{{item:3070}} {{item:3070}}. We want URF and keep it as a permanent game mode for ever.\r\n\r\nSo disappointing Riot.","replies":[{"poster":"xSynx","date":"2016-08-16T12:39:55.310+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I don't play any other game modes but Ranked, Normal and the occasional ARAM.
