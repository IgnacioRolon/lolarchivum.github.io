My suggestion is that:\r\n\r\nWhen you load into the loading screen, there will be a beautiful wallpaper background with a 3D summoners rift minimap in the middle of the screen just like in the champ selection on the bottom right corner. Then you can add each player onto the map (placing them according to their role) with their summoner spells, champion icon, name and most of all... the loading percentage. Ill probably repost this with an image for a demonstration of what im talking about but for now this is pretty much my suggestion. New year, new champion selection and new loading screen!","replies":[{"poster":"Olee","date":"2016-01-21T09:14:11.663+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Nah, I want 3D splash arts","replies":[]}]}
