I have lot&#039;s of other games and i&#039;m able to run them at high quality so you don&#039;t have to worry about me lagging hopefully. If your interested in playing league or just any other games in general be sure to hit me up on discord. I&#039;m level 20 on my NA account because i only play with Americans on league but I&#039;m only level 10 on my Oceania. Although my level is low i was playing with level 30 all the time on NA so I&#039;m quite good but not the best.
