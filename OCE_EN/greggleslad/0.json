I am tired of co op flops that play on Aram and disrespect team effort by throwing a game (How to make salt) I have over 1000 wins and play most champs.  Aram success is not about getting a good champ selection IMO its about understanding the map and most of all the enemy team champs.  That understanding IMO is having a club that shares the same knowledge and experience.
