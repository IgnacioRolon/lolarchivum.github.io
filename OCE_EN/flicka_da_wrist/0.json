How is it possible that RIOT still hasn&#039;t found a fix to the problem. I moved back to my country and I haven&#039;t been able to play here because of this. WHEN WILL TRANSFERS BECOME AVAILABLE AGAIN. Is Riot really working on a fix? Or am I just stupid enough to believe it and login everyday with the hope that it will be fixed. Perhaps this is the world telling me to stop playing this game.","replies":[{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2018-12-17T10:34:04.813+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You can follow the updates on the NA thread directly here: https://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/general-discussion/hi2Yf2sI-account-transfer-service-down\n\nAnd Gehirn will likely also mirror any important updates here on OCE: https://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/general-discussion/hi2Yf2sI-account-transfer-service-down","replies":[]}]}
