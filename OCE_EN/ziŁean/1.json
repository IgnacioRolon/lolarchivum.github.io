Don&#039;t even reply. Well i learnt that from the internet long ago but in this game it is crucial.\r\nNo team ever wins when they argue - it&#039;s real. \r\n\r\nI received my first 14 day ban today which i feel is unjust but obviously i&#039;d said too much in not only the 1 game.\r\nI&#039;m going to stop using the chat entirely except for objectives. no suggestions, no banter. \r\nI would be interested to know how the system works and if a party of 2+ can co ordinate and lie to have an account suspended?\r\n\r\nI had a guy telling me to kill myself and that he&#039;s going to find me and bash my head open with a rock then 40 seconds later i was banned! \r\nAll because i played heimer jungle !! Didn&#039;t feed or anything. \r\nHe started arguing before i had finished my first jungle clear to do something or he&#039;d go afk and when i flamed back and told him to go AFK the abuse got worse.\r\nI&#039;m just curious how i get banned in this situation as i got honoured by another team member who i wasn&#039;t duo with? \r\nDid they say i was being racist or telling them to commit suicide? (like i was told to)\r\n\r\n\r\nSo yes, when my account is released from suspension i&#039;m going to really not say anything. i think that&#039;s the only way to succeed in such a competitive environment. People really take this game seriously. If you break the meta you will be reported. \r\n\r\n\r\nIf any riot staff are around i&#039;d appreciate if you looked into my last game and the full context of what was said. \r\nI realise you can&#039;t fight fire with fire but i would really appreciate if you looked into the ryze from my last game and how he talks in other games. \r\nPsychotic for a lack of better word and somehow i was the one punished. \r\nahwell..\r\n\r\nMy ticket: TICKET #37466644\r\n\r\nIf it can&#039;t be appealed i&#039;ll suck it up and wait 14 days but my lesson is learnt. don&#039;t talk. {{champion:33}} \r\nI was looking forward to finishing my climb before the season ended but sometimes it be like that. {{summoner:7}}","replies":[{"poster":"Project Xayah","date":"2018-11-05T22:45:34.722+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=MellowHypè,realm=OCE,application-id=T8eq2lFQ,discussion-id=dAhfLyUu,comment-id=,timestamp=2018-11-05T16:02:15.497+0000)\n>\n> I would be interested to know how the system works and if a party of 2+ can co ordinate and lie to have an account suspended?\n\nTo be clear, the way the report system works is that only 1 player in any given game needs to submit a report for the case to be reviewed. As far as I know (and *may* be wrong on this point), reports from the same pre-made group are generally weighted less as well to avoid such abuse of the system. After a case has been flagged for review, the systems in place determine the validity of reports and essentially just trash invalid reports. There are rare instances that can result in false positives, but it generally happens less than most people think.\n\nIf you want some help with going through the chat logs, you can post feel free to post them here, but obviously your best bet at a successful appeal is to handle the situation with Support.","replies":[{"poster":"ZIŁEAN","date":"2018-11-06T00:00:53.860+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"That's good to know and yeah obviously i've been flagged in more than one game. \nJust curious as to how the system actually determines who is at fault in a premade situation. \nGoing around like a flag squad {{champion:59}} \n\nThe one sided chat log definitely makes me look like an obnoxious asshat. I can see my error lol. \n(which is replying to negativity with negativity) and i can survive a 14 day ban although it would be cool to finish the season off it's no biggie. just a lesson. \n\nI did submit a ticket though so if they review it and cut me the benefit of the doubt (first ban since 2011) then that would also be cool but i won't hold my breathe.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Nikki","date":"2018-11-06T04:26:27.689+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"ugh, yeah. Baiting a verbal abuse report is super cancerous and its unfortunate that players know the bot will side with them. \nthere used to be a bunch of people that would be like what is the capital of this country and typing it in english contained a profane term like \"Nigeria\" would get flagged as you trying to say the N word. People still do it but it seems way less common now. the most common one ive seen is people will try get you to abbreviate something into \"kys\" because thats one of the easiest ways to get instant feedback. It really sucks, the punishment for these people baiting should be severe. 14 day or perm ban at first time being caught. \n\nif you're playing to get somebody penalised, and not because you enjoy the game that is a sign there is a major issue with the person in question. Serious mental health issues or sociopathy going on there.","replies":[]}]}
