Getting suspended by a computer for 1 game with no context ???\r\n\r\nIF someone had the chat logs to the game (not what I was punished for) \r\nThey'd know:\r\n1. I was allocated mid role\r\n2. 3 man premade team banned my champion (zilean) \r\n3. I said fine, i'll play kat. \r\n4. My team picked kat and took my lane \r\n5. Premade laughs at me \r\n6. I play aram mid (which our team suggested, it's in the chat logs)\r\n7. I get suspended\r\n\r\nI play like 6+ ranked games a day, this was a normal game that I was being trolled in before the game even began and my duo even had the most kills on the team! He got suspended too! \r\nIt wasn't for being toxic it was for feeding.. but how do you respond in this situation?\r\nTribunal would have solved this and likely let everyone move on, I didn't even report my team but now I wish I did. \r\nMajority rules and bully pack mentality prevails again.","replies":[{"poster":"Project Xayah","date":"2020-02-25T04:40:47.873+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"If you want to appeal a punishment, you should submit a ticket to [Support](https://support-leagueoflegends.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/requests/new) (use the \"Discuss a personal suspension or restriction\" option), and they'll go through the process for that, including a manual review. Since this seems to be relevant to a gameplay offence, it's important to note that such punishments rarely, if ever, trigger off a single game (third party software may be an exception to that), and generally go through significant review before being acted upon.\n\nSo far as the Tribunal is concerned, Riot decided to get rid of it for several reasons, primarily it had a few major issues that made the system effectively useless, and so they changed the punishment systems for something that would act more effectively and efficiently.\n\nOne of the big things regarding the Tribunal is that many players who used the system ended up voting for unnecessary punishments (or over-punishments), which meant that most every case had to be manually reviewed anyway, which meant that one of the primary functions of the system (less manual oversight by Riot) was effectively made useless, and became more trouble than it was worth.\n\nIt's also important to consider that under the Tribunal system, most cases ended up being under review for several months before any action was taken, and while certain cases may have warranted that kind of attention (for example, \"soft-inting\"), it also meant that many \"clear cut\" cases were being drawn out unnecessarily (some of which the current system can handle within 15 minutes of game end), allowing offending players to continue playing, and ruining games, for far longer than they should have been.\n\nUltimately, the Tribunal was far from an efficient, or useful, system, and was ultimately removed (likely permanently) because of the flaws it had and the fact Riot couldn't reasonably justify it's existence.","replies":[{"poster":"ZIŁEAN","date":"2020-02-25T05:19:02.876+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Well i'm sure it had flaws but if used correctly (say by only players with a high honour level and being rewarded for contribution) \nCan't be less flawed than the current AI that bans you within 30 seconds without considering any variables in the situation.\nThanks for the advice I did that on Saturday and no review yet but you were here quickly!
