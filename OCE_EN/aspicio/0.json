So yer, most devs shy away from that as a result.\n\nThe Gurren Lagann Rumble took years of requesting to finally get onto LoL. But good work for Riot on the creation of Magical Girl Lux however, it certainly took me by surprise.\n\nI really wish they can put maybe just a few more anime references into this game, seeing how anime is definitely one of the large integrals of popular culture and I wish they can be less worrying when it comes to opening up possibilities on this particular skin line.\n\n**EDIT:** I think Fate, like Attack on Titan and Tokyo Ghoul, are a bit too overrated though (they certainly deserve praises but imo they are getting way more than they deserve). But that's just me. Still it would be a cool skin if they were to make one base on it, not sure if they will run into problems however as Fate itself is based on world mythology, folklores and history in the first place, most people would just go with the literature impressions instead of the anime illustrations.","replies":[{"poster":"Aspicio","date":"2015-05-24T21:53:10.295+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yeah, totally I know all about the Sigma behind anime hate, then again the same people that hate anime usually hate league of Legends and world of war craft for the same unjust reasons and regarding the overrated anime, I totally agree with you for Tokyo ghoul and attack on Titan but I honestly believe the newer ufotable animated fate series are actually brilliant especially for their takes on human ideologies and real world myths.","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Urgot Bot","date":"2015-05-25T11:02:23.178+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Archer Varus XD\n\nNext you'll be telling me you are making a skin called Flaming Brand or Dragon Shyvana\n\nMaybe even Rat Twitch","replies":[]}]}
