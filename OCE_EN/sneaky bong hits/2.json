{"poster":"Sneaky Bong Hits","date":"2016-03-27T11:51:54.516+0000","title":"[Unacceptable] Riot and Community, please read.","subforum":"Miscellaneous","up_votes":13,"down_votes":4,"body":"Hello Summoners, this is a long read but very important.\n\nRecently a friend of mine (who we will call Steve) known in game as The Prodigal has been permanently banned from League of Legends for &#039;Scripting, Hacking, Macroing&#039;. What course of action do you think this Summoner took to receive such punishment? Aim bots? Camera hacks? As it turns out, this user was _permanently_ banned from the game for doing so much as macroing to **call his role**. For those of you who do not know what this means, it&#039;s changing the way a button on your hardware works so that when it&#039;s pressed it types your preferred role and automatically sends it, saving you the time of writing it out. Countless players use this technique in order to obtain their preferred role in the Summoner&#039;s Rift Blind Pick mode. We both agree he deserves punishment, but absolutely not a permanent ban. \n\nNow let&#039;s get technical. Here are two extracts from Steve&#039;s inbox and Riot which outline their so-called &#039;preservation of a fair environment&#039;. I know it&#039;s a daunting read, but otherwise you can&#039;t fathom how wrong it is once we break it down.\n\n&quot;Your account has been permanently suspended following the use of scripts, hacks, exploits or unauthorized third-party programs in League of Legends. Accounts that are caught using hacks to gain an unfair competitive advantage are subject to permanent suspension. We work hard to preserve a fair and competitive environment in League of Legends. Regardless of intent, use of unauthorized third-party programs is explicitly against the Terms of Use, which can be found here:&quot;\n\n_Extract:_\n&quot;J. Using any unauthorized third party programs, including but not limited to &quot;mods,&quot; &quot;hacks,&quot; &quot;cheats,&quot; &quot;scripts,&quot; &quot;bots,&quot; &quot;trainers,&quot; and automation programs, that interact with the Software in any way, for any purpose, including, without limitation, any unauthorized third party programs that intercept, emulate, or redirect any communication between the Software and Riot Games and any unauthorized third party programs that collect information about the Game by reading areas of memory used by the Software to store information;&quot;\n\nRight now you might be thinking, &quot;Well, you crybaby, the Terms of Use clearly say if you interact with the software in ANY WAY..&quot;. Let me tell you the extent of BS Riot is capable of perma-banning you for as a result of this statement. In fact, sceptical reader, you&#039;re probably already guilty.\n\nFirst and foremost, the letter describes that Steve&#039;s punishment is a result of him:\n1. Hacking, which by definition is **&quot;To gain unauthorized access to data in a system or computer.&quot;**\n2. Gaining an unfair _competitive_ advantage.\n3. Using an &#039;automation&#039; program to do such a thing (revealed below)\n4. Using this program to interact with Riot&#039;s software, when Steve did no such thing.\n\nWhile a handful of players in Blind Pick (and Blind Pick only as a result of the new Dynamic Queue) become irritated when another player beats them to calling a role, this course of action gives either team absolutely **no** advantage in any way, and therefore does not provide a player with an unfair competitive advantage. You might argue it&#039;s unfair to other players but it does NOT provide an advantage in the sense that it will help you to win. Even if you were to push the ban on that, which Riot did, it&#039;s so technical that we may as well argue that so much as lagging is permaban-worthy because it&#039;s &#039;unfair&#039; to your team. I&#039;d assume that players with a better connection enter the Champion Select first anyway, so making your keys type and enter your role for you has an even less impact on the game. On a side note, as this form of macroing can only exist in Blind Pick, it seems unreasonable that all game modes are suspended from the player with the account altogether.\n\nSecondly, and this is a killer, Riot&#039;s Terms of Use _clearly_ states that using an automation program which can interact with League of Legends in any way _without limitation_ is capable of earning you a permanent ban. Razer Synapse, a popular, legal software that interacts with a user&#039;s hardware (purchased from the same company) is what Steve used to turn a key on his keyboard into a macro. This program is also capable of improving mouse speed to levels not accessible to a user without, which as we&#039;ve seen is enough to earn you a permanent ban. Now that we understand the extent you can define Riot&#039;s Terms of Use to, it only makes sense that by definition, a player is susceptible to a permanent ban if, for arguments sake, they:\n-Adjust _their mouse speed_  by any program, including the mouse settings in the Control Panel\n-They use any reprogrammed button on hardware used to play the game.\n\nAnd if this is true, double standards also say it&#039;s only fair for a player to be permanently banned if:\n-They use hardware intended for easier gameplay (includes gaming keyboards and other hardware as they have a better response time, and assets such as keypads which are a lot more comfortable)\n\nThis goes even further. A macro by definition is &quot;a single instruction that expands automatically into a set of instructions to perform a particular task.&quot;. Guess what CONTROL + V is to your computer. **Doing something as simple as copying and pasting your preferred role into the Champion Select entitles Riot to _permanently suspend_ your account**\n\nI am not saying that Riot is wrong for condemning such macroing (even though it&#039;s almost negligibly accurate to Riot&#039;s descriptions of &#039;interacting with the software&#039;, &#039;hacking&#039; etc), but a permanent ban to an otherwise reasonable player is absolutely unacceptable. It&#039;s rubbish. This player has invested so much time and money into his account and the punitive actions taken not only have holes in them but are borderline heartless. He agrees and acknowledges his fault, and he accepts punishment of even a month-long ban but as we&#039;ve seen in no way is it reasonable to permanently suspend this account. Yes, technically he breached the Terms of Use, but this does not warrant a permanent ban. Come on Riot, was this even run through the Tribunal?\n\nFor some reason this thing won&#039;t let me make a poll, but guys, what&#039;s your take on the situation? Should he be punished / banned temporarily? Should all punishments be elevated? Should he really be permanently banned?","replies":[{"poster":"Riot Cluvie","date":"2016-03-28T20:59:03.992+0000","up_votes":9,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey there OP --\n\nCan't really talk about the details of someone else's account, but I appreciate your concern here.

Why should those without such macro's be reduced to not playing a role because they follow the rules and don't use them? If i had joined his games 3 times in a row and that macro took my prefered role each time and i noticed it. I'd report it also. \n\nAlso, i know its a trend... but until riot impliments a dual role prior to cue. You should remain flexible always, some people have slower loadins than others and will ALWAYS end up support or jungle... Or should those players just take it on the chin? In which case... Take the ban on the chin also. I find it unfair, its against riots policy, it was found out and the account banned. Simples. Rules aren't there to be bent or broken. They're there to be followed. Don't use the macro just to shove other summoners out of a position because of it. \n\nYou Sir, are a fool to argue with the system and the rules in place.

Permanent bans in that category are the result of changing the game in a way that **negatively** disadvantages others; merely changing a button to call a lane doesn't come close to meeting that standard.
