Just stand there, click and watch as your enemy's health bar depletes.\r\n\r\nNEW: Malzahar fires the laser beam out in a line (starting slowly from right infront of him and then moving the laser forward up to the maximum range, if you understand what I mean?) malzahar suppresses the first enemy champion hit in the line for 2.5 seconds and deals (the same) magic damage every 0.5 seonds. Malzahar is spell immune while suppressing and damaging his target but he will take damage, meaning the only way to stop Malzahar is to kill him. Allies can intercept the laser to take the full damage instead of allies because Malzahar cannot cancel this ability.\r\n\r\nWhat do you guys think?\r\n-BrodeRage","replies":[{"poster":"DarkShade918","date":"2015-03-01T23:28:18.071+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"How about no, malz ult only does serious damage if you get your opponent on the null-zone and have a couple of voidlings, his ult is purely for obliterating tanks, it does more to them then it does to the average adc, combine with liandries and abyssal then it is OP but his ult does not need to be a skillshot","replies":[]},{"poster":"Unseen Predator","date":"2015-03-01T05:30:16.774+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"These forums are hilarious sometimes, first the AP QSS item and now this a skill shot for Malz ultimate.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Olee","date":"2015-03-01T04:42:12.172+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I think the only way to make Malzahar balanced (he's not really THAT broken atm to begin with) is to keep his ult as strong as it is but just make the rest of his kit, a little less useful. (Less CC, Less AOE) Or just bring the numbers down on the rest of his abilities. At the moment, he has an extremely high damaging ult which is also a good form of cc for your team to follow up on, BUT he ALSO has a high base number AOE Nuke/Silence. A large AOE DoT damage that does % damage AND a single target point and click DoT ability that spreads. Not to mention his voidling is seriously so strong xD","replies":[]},{"poster":"BladeSensual","date":"2015-03-01T07:21:29.623+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"r u high?\nmalz is easy to beat. buy qss and u beat him\n1 ITEM COUNTERS HIM. support get mikaels. i bet if they made lee sins ult a skill shot (before he kicks champion) or make veigars ult a skillshot, people would b up in arms about it. malz is no where near as broken as half the champs in league. he has no mobility AT ALL. he is single target combo mage","replies":[]},{"poster":"GoldenTomat0","date":"2015-03-01T01:43:53.138+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"I think it's dumb and he's better the way he is. at least the way he is now he has some counterplay.","replies":[]}]}
