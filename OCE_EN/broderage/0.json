I have put $100 plus into the game and I want to support it's growth as I think the developers are awesome and the game itself if really fun. I have invited many friends to play the game and I have been playing for a while too.\r\nPBE seems really cool and I want to try it out and test new things. Please Riot, allow Oceania-ians to go on the PBE and test!\r\nThanks, BrodeRage","replies":[{"poster":"l0k123l0l","date":"2016-11-19T07:42:45.933+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I really want pbe on oceania, because its a bit unfair if the other countries get it but us.{{sticker:slayer-jinx-catface}}","replies":[]},{"poster":"ERFIRE","date":"2016-05-07T11:02:28.416+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Its so unfair.\nrito should check out {{summoner:2}} this forum out.","replies":[]},{"poster":"xRaven80x","date":"2016-04-10T00:42:58.742+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Idk why Riot didn't think about Oceania.

PBE is where most of the bugs are caught and as such you need to understand how to format a bug that a developer could take back to his desk and  pinpoint the line or block of code that causes it.\n\nThis was one of the main reasons open PBE was closed.","replies":[]}]}
