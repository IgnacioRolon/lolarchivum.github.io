Other than that, I do think she's pretty balanced, as I've taken a dump on her with darius, yasuo, vi, you name it i've probably killed riven with them. it's all about understanding your champ and riven. If you've got a dash (yasuo), wait until she has used both q's and is going for her third, and dash past the location she wants, so you're behind her. She's wasted her knockup, and you get a few precious seconds to beat her face in while she waits for the cooldown.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Holland","date":"2015-04-16T11:45:45.495+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Make riven a mana user DONE SHE IS BALANCED!","replies":[]},{"poster":"jb3navides","date":"2015-04-16T00:10:59.452+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"***","replies":[{"poster":"kJs","date":"2015-04-16T11:43:07.370+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"LeBlac is great at that but even in high Elo it's easy to get out of chain CCs.
