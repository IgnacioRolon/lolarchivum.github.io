I think It is about time that everything was cleared to let the riven rework come through ASAP.\r\nI don&#039;t want to sound demanding from Riot Games, I do appreciate the work they do to update the game so often with new champions and reworks (the new hud looks awesome!!!). But I think Riven needs to change to have a unique, more skillfull skill set.\r\nI have had too many games with a riven on the enemy team leeching the fun out of the game with their Over poweredness. Even if they are AFK for the first 20 minutes, they can come back and carry teams to victory with her no mana, no risk all reward style gameplay.\r\nIt would be good if riven&#039;s kit got changed to be newer and require more skill (like fiora&#039;s update) maybe a visual update could go well for her too, I don&#039;t care just a kit change would be brilliant!!\r\nThanks- BrodeRage\r\nTL;DR:\r\nREWORK {{champion:92}}","replies":[{"poster":"Tele","date":"2015-07-22T09:26:59.243+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Fiora was reworked not really because she was OP but because she was inconsistent. She either dealt crap loads of damage when ahead or did absolutely nothing when behind. Fiora was pretty good in Bronze though, she had a 52% - 53% winrate some days because of it. And she can be hard to deal with sometimes, depending on the champions you play.\n\nBut it's kind of a meme that Fiora is one of the worst champions in the game, here's a Sky Williams video where he uses the meme https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AJ4vPCY11eM\n\nHonestly I think Fiora will be more \"OP\" after the rework, 2 true damage abilities plus stun and slow, that sounds really good to me.\n\nNow about Riven, you're probably not going to believe me but Riven is one of the hardest champions to play in the game. If you're getting rekt by Rivens you're probably unknowingly counter picking yourself, playing the match up wrong or going against actually good Riven players. Most likely the earlier two are happening.\n\nRiven is quite high risk, high reward honestly, if you don't get ahead you'll probably loose the game. Her CC is is nice, but it's not like Gnar or Malphite where a good full team ult can win the game.\n\nTL;DR\nRiven is not really OP, you're probably doing something wrong. Neither was Fiora really. BTW if you're trolling it's done extremely well GJ ;)","replies":[]},{"poster":"C4RL05M3X1C4N0","date":"2015-07-23T02:12:22.310+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"{{champion:78}} that is all","replies":[]},{"poster":"DiamondAries","date":"2015-07-22T10:57:08.984+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Riven isn't OP. She one of the champions that A LOT people think are OP, but she really isn't. Riven is one of the hardest champions to play right, but when you do, she can rek anyone and everyone. She herself has one of the lowest HP regen stats in the game, her defences are pitiful, and the smallest amount of hard CC can ruin her momentum and cause players to lose their timings with her and most likely resulting in a death. If you are losing to Riven, then you need to learn how to play against her (like going in after she pops her shield), play safe, or even play her for a while to really understand her points of weakness.","replies":[]}]}
