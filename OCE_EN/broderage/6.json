I have made a document below, stated new abilites (apart from Ultimate) that I feel (with a bit of tweaking) would solve the problem of OP katarina, and still have the versatility and assissin/mage- feel that Katarina players will love.\r\n\r\nNEW: Katarina now has a mana bar.\r\nNEW: Passive- \"Varacity\": Whenever an enemy champion dies within 3 seconds of Katarina dealing damage to them, her cooldowns will be reduced by 5 seconds and she will gain 15% of her current mana back.\r\nNEW:  Q- \"Deadly Dagger(?)\": Katarina Throws a blade at out in a straight line; dealing 35/50/70/85/100 magic damage and passing through all enemies. The blade stays behind at the end of the range or if the ability is recast. Q marks all enemies hit. (cooldowns: 11/10.5/9.5/8/7) (mana: 40/55/65/80/95)\r\nNEW: W- \"Sinister Steel\": Katarina spins around dealing 40/55/70/90/110 magic damage. The blade (q) will deal damage to enemies around the blade. Enemies hit by katarina’s spin are marked; marked enemies can be E’d too (shunpo). (cooldowns: 8/7/6/5.5/4) (mana: 45/60/75/85/100)\r\nNEW: E- \"Shunpo\": Katarina can teleport to a marked enemy, marked minion, or a ward. Katarina gains 15/20/25/30/35% movement speed if she E’s to a marked enemy champion. Katarina can also teleport to the blade from Q. (cooldowns: 12/10/8/7.5/7) (mana: 35 at all ranks)\r\n\r\nMany times in a game have I been in the mid lane against a Katarina. The most recent was when I was Talon. I did well early on, got 3-4 kills and didn’t die until later on, but the Katarina (who basically fed me and didn’t get any kills until about 15 minutes) ended up winning the game for their team.\r\nThe Katarina suddenly started doing insane amounts of damage and she didn’t even get any kills until she got a random triple and from then on, she kept going and going and killing everyone. Her Q is over powered early on as the bouncing means that Katarina can hit you even if you are hiding behind minion protection, or even if you are not; it also requires no skill to hit, just click...\r\nHer W does a lot of damage and the movement speed buff, though it is slight; adds to the OP-ness (:D ha ha) Also the cooldown is 4 seconds! Meaning that she can spam, and spam, and spam thanks to her “NO MANA” bar which is just overpowered in itself.\r\nHer E has heaps of range and deals heaps of damage and let’s her initiate, escape and generally move around very quickly at the cost of nothing. And don’t forget the passive that allows for infinite jumps as long as she gets kills, which shouldn’t be too hard as Katarina! \r\nRespond down below, do you like my ideas; and do you think she needs a nerf, or do you like the Katarina that is playable today?\r\n-BrodeRage","replies":[{"poster":"Lumer","date":"2015-02-28T23:12:03.909+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Mana would destroy kat.
