So if you directed your posts to riot about nerfing Yas rather than moaning about S's then you'd be more likely to get one.\n\nbuuuuuut if you want a cheat code: Just afk farm the whole game, CS counts for way more than kills. I aim for 10 CS a minute and to have 400+ by the end of the game, and i got S+ 3 times in a row with Azir with average as scores (just as long as you don't die lots) and got lvl 7 just like that, riot never said the system was fair.","replies":[{"poster":"CrimsonKaiser","date":"2016-07-01T09:20:47.500+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Lord Sesshomaru,realm=OCE,application-id=Ntey9fRZ,discussion-id=KV1qx9c2,comment-id=0001,timestamp=2016-06-27T22:16:09.766+0000)\n>\n> Technically it is Justice.\n> \n> Your scores are marked against all other Yasuo players, Yasuo is an easy champion to do well with and there are a LOT of people who play him, therefore there will be a LOT of very high scores, so those high scores become his average (not a good score, just his average score) which means that you need a ridiculously high score to get a &#x27;good&#x27; score with Yas.\n> \n> So it is in everyones best interests for Yas to be weaker and for less people to play him, that way you could get your S&#x27;s without having to go 1000/1/1000 and the rest of us wouldn&#x27;t have to deal with him in every single game.
