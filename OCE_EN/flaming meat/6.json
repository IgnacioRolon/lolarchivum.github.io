Previously an Illaoi OT but with the rise of hyper ADC&#039;s and ardent she is just garbage currently, so I play mostly whats good. I finished the preseason D5, actual season Plat IV, took a long break from league and came back a few months ago playing on and off and actually getting myself banned for &#039;scripting&#039; (lifted), which was chalked up due to OCE salt and false reports. I have been hard stuck in limbo between Gold I and II, having been back and forth for 5 times now, each time winning games as normal, then going on a fat loss streak and being demoted.\r\n\r\nI&#039;m looking for any duo or trio to try and curb my odds so we can get to at-least plat by the end of the season.
