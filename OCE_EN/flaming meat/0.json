I got told by the jungler that &quot;I wish your entire family died infront of you you ****&quot; at ~1:50 because I gave a 4 auto leash as draven when he asked for a &quot;hard leash&quot;. Ok, I&#039;m used to that, but in a level 5 game? The jungle was on a level 3 account and persisted being at that level of extreme toxicity the whole game while the 2 others he was queued with jumped on the bandwagon and flamed me to hell also.\r\n\r\nWhat goes through people&#039;s heads? Imagine if I weren&#039;t a seasoned player and I was legit really new to the game getting ganged up and bullied. I have been getting tens of games like this as I am leveling my new account and have never received the pop-up from riot prompting that my reports have been successful.\r\n\r\nSo what I want to know is: Where are my reports going? Can someone be banned for being absolutely ridiculously toxic in only one game, or does it have to be more consistent?\r\n\r\nI know you can just mute them but having that weight on you that your team is talking smack behind your back as you play is just ridiculous and shouldn&#039;t even be a problem that OCE players encounter on such a regular basis.","replies":[{"poster":"Fitzky","date":"2016-04-21T07:41:18.351+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'm seeing so many of these posts lately, it's making me want to just quit, this behaviour in a game is just atrocious and I've never seen it this bad in any other game...","replies":[{"poster":"Flaming Meat","date":"2016-04-21T07:45:54.131+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Join me on BnS Japan :p","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Légs","date":"2016-04-24T13:13:00.280+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I noticed that justice is only served when multiple people report the same player, you should get a notification on your screen if the person you reported got punished.\n\nCould be wrong though, but the only time I've seen someone punished in my games is if there are a couple other people saying they will report the toxic person too.\n\nThat being said, I read somewhere that this usually won't apply when it comes to premades, for obvious reasons.\n\nYour only option here is to encourage other people to report, especially in post lobby.","replies":[{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2016-04-24T15:50:12.175+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"It's not so much multiple people as it is consistent reports against a player over at least a couple games. Incredibly rare is it that someone will be banned or a first offense, and inconsistent and infrequent negativity is often let slide as well (barring extreme cases).\n\nYou also only get the notification if your report was the last one that triggered the punishment, so most people will never/rarely see those notifications even if their reports are accurate. (We know that's a pain point, believe me)\n\nEncouraging people to report can be risky, especially in the case of the other team if the behaviour was not evident to them. It can paint you as the salty bad guy and can end up getting you reported instead (won't get punished just for that, but obviously not the desired result). If the behaviour is obvious, and you have been uninvolved in it, then asking is usually ok, but if you're invested at all in the negativity best not to.\n\nPremade reports are effectively equal to a solo players report, but you only need one valid report in a game to 'strike' a player.","replies":[{"poster":"Légs","date":"2016-04-24T15:55:04.095+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thanks so much :o\n\nI usually only ask people on my team though, cos I doubt the enemy team will really care.","replies":[{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2016-04-24T16:05:44.754+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Of course.
