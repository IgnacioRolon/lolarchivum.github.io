That way hackers have very little information to try and reverse engineer their way around the system.\n\n All we know is that serious scripters are [banned in waves](http://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/miscellaneous/AEVP3NMA-anti-cheater-banwave-incoming) for security reasons. This is likely why this player hasn't been banned yet. \n\n+ **Instant Feedback**\n Theoretically, someone could be [perma-banned instantly](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/207489286-Instant-Feedback-System-FAQ-#h1q4) by the instant feedback system if their behavior was serious enough. It really depends on how toxic they are, and whether people report them.\n\nAs for being banned by video; **Riot** is not likely to punish a player using solely a video, but it might prompt an in-depth investigation, that could end with some form of punishment. This happened with players such as **Tyler1** himself and **XJ9**, who now have special indefinite bans.\n\nI hope this helps :)","replies":[{"poster":"Flaming Meat","date":"2016-05-16T04:44:40.236+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Wave banning corrupts the ladder though right?
