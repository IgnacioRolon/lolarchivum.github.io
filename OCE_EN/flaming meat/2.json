They have been doing so for tens of ranked games and I can only assume will be perm banned soon. So in the interest of keeping the ranked ladder as feeder/scripter free and placing player exactly where they should be, is there a system in place where it gives back lost elo? I understand that it isn&#039;t feasible to gift back the lost lp, but does it, like in CS, gift back that juicy hidden number that determines how much lp people will gain or lose?\r\n\r\nAlso pre-game chat log for anyone interested (names removed):\r\n[I had top, 1 had mid (Picked Hecarim, ghost/clense, ran down toplane), 2 had support (Picked Draven, yelled run it down mid and proceeded to do just that)]\r\n1 : top or feedc\r\n1 : sorry bud\r\nMe : cewl\r\n1 : cewl?\r\nMe : I&#039;ll mid then\r\n1 : hmmm\r\n2 : nah im playing mid\r\n1 : no you top\r\nMe : lol\r\n1 : but I dont like illaoi\r\n2 : get cucked kid\r\nMe : coool\r\n2 : bot lane is mine btw\r\n2 : yu take cs i feed\r\n1 : I might just run your lane down Me\r\n2 : why you lock in cait lmao\r\nMe : !kick\r\nMe : kek\r\n2 : flame support\r\nMe : naaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa\r\n2 : yer\r\nMe : I&#039;d rather you feed\r\n1 : draven supp works\r\n2 : nah\r\n2 : im not saupport im top\r\n2 : lel\r\nMe : cool\r\n1 : we gonna win this easyyyyy\r\nMe : duo top\r\n2 : :)\r\nMe : I&#039;m not dodging\r\nMe : would be a loss on promos anyways\r\nMe : so\r\nGame Start...","replies":[{"poster":"Exarch Leona","date":"2016-08-06T02:38:05.524+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Nothing will happen.

All I can say is to report AFK's as they will get punished for excessive leaving.\n\nPS: I'm incorrect in one point, the only exception is the /remake system stated below.\n\n* If any player is dc’d or flagged afk for at least 90 seconds at the three minute mark, a /remake is available\n* A first blood against a player’s team before they leave/dc prevents a remake vote.\n* All players on that team have one minute to prompt a vote by typing /remake in chat.\n* The vote needs at least two of four players (30% of players in game) to agree, at which point the game ends.\n* All players connected to the game basically pretend the game never happened, gaining or losing no LP/IP/XP, and seeing no change to their overall W/L records.\n* The dc’d player (or players) takes full LP losses or drop a promo game, and are also flagged by Leaver Buster.\n* Note for ranked: To protect competitive integrity, Diamond V and above players will also take a loss when the dc’d player is in their premade; We’ll keep an eye on this restriction to see if it needs to extend to lower ranks","replies":[]},{"poster":"Pikachoochoo","date":"2016-07-10T07:39:44.907+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Only if it's like 2 major feeders or 2-3 feeding I think =/ I had an Annie ally once that  had no items for like 20-minutes and didn't cast any thing and just followed us around, dying.

(Love the name btw)\n\nCurrently I don't think Riot have a Loss Prevention system set up for things like that, but possibly in the future they may look into it. Its hard to know. Riots Punishment system is actively working to punish players for scripting and other breaches of the summoner code. \n\nIf you know the players usernames you can always send a support ticket using this link [Riot Support](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us) so that Riot administrators can investigate. \n\nThe only loss prevention set up is the remake system. If a player is AFK for more then 3 - 5 minutes the team can vote to REMAKE the entire game, thus deciding a DEFEAT/LOSS that isn't counted.\n\nOnly if the server is having multiple issues, shutting down or Riot is doing maintenance actively will a game be somewhat eligible for loss prevention as far as I know. \n\nAnything further or if I need correction the Emissaries will most likely comment below.\n\nHappy Games!","replies":[{"poster":"Flaming Meat","date":"2016-07-10T07:09:33.779+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yeh maybe I'm being too optimistic with what I expect from answers. Ideally someone can tell me for sure where a Rioter has mentioned that elo is gifted back or not after such games or a Rioter will actually divulge this information to the thread or public from my request.\n\nI'd imagine it should be a thing. I know going off of op.gg is never accurate to the actual numbers (e.g. I dropped 400 elo from 1.9k due to it reading my 0-0-0 3 minute game as a super loss when it was just remade).","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"fattyhotdogs","date":"2016-07-10T02:16:27.076+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Do intentional feeders on the enemy team who get banned give you a win prevented?","replies":[{"poster":"Flaming Meat","date":"2016-07-10T07:05:45.423+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It does in CS:GO LOL. But I'm never looking for reimbursement for lp, thats whatever, its more the elo that you lose from a loss or gain from a win, because both sides are making the ladder inaccurate in placing players where they should be. Losing games also give you less lp for future wins obviously, this number is directly tied to elo. I just wanted to know if that hidden number went back up after they are banned and the game is one that counted towards their ban.","replies":[]}]}]}
