I got a lot of hate because of load times and had to predict when things were going to happen(ie, champs comin forward, minions, etc) I was addicted from the get go and because of the restriction on ip acquisition, i made around seven accounts on the different servers. The first time I had a computer that could give me good fps, I ended up doing 40 hours straight so i didn miss 1 minute of time with the computer. Over the years  I have had an off and on again periods of play due to computer access. The changes have made it harder for a person like me as my reaction times aren&#039;t as good as some others, and I have liked the addition of aram and the rotating game. \r\n\r\nI have experienced great frustration lately as a result of a few things that I think are overlooked or disregarded, such as the changes to items and champs over the years( i.e., I used to have a set for voli and play style to match, and have only recently finally adapted to this, and as such it took away a lot of enjoyment from playing him for a while), plus the fact that toxic players have been a problem for years. I understand that we all get frustrated at times and have fallen prey to it myself, but some people take it to the extreme, which is sad because whether u make a mistake or your play style is different to what others think you should be like, it doesn&#039;t mean you have the right to tell someone to not play again etc. This is especially noticeable in ranked. I would also like to see an aram championship, and/or a masters championship. I know that the majority of players are under 35 but there is a noticeable number of over 35&#039;s like me that would love to play championships but would be unable to compete against some of the younger players.\r\n\r\nFinally, I was little disappointed at my rewards recently with the changeover from the ip to essence. I thought I would recieve a little more than I did, being a long term player( dont get me wrong, am appreciative of what i did get across both my accounts, but thought I would have got a little more, not too much more tho) \r\n\r\nI am not a savvy internet user, I dont go on blogs, dont check the site much except for relevant news, I am just a guy who loves lol as probably the greatest game I have ever played, and I say this because even if you have the same map, players and champs, the game can be totally different, and I think it is the best example of the diversity that computer games give you. I love the way riot encourages everyone to remember it is a game, and through it you can learn many things, such as, teamwork, conflict resolution, problem solving, analytical skills, spatial thinking and other concepts such as maths. \r\n\r\nUltimately I would love to work for you but that is a bit of a pipe dream, as I dont have any it skills, just people skills, but I would like to thank you for your time and consideration of my words above. Also I am not happy about the fact I have written this and am now being told to put it on a board, as I am directing this at riot and not others.\r\n\r\nSincerely\r\nJoey Pinnow\r\nfunnypin, funnypin77{{champion:106}}","replies":[]}
