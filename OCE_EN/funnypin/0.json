When we sat down to select the regions which would participate in the inaugural tournament, we looked at the distribution of pro and semi pro players. We found that the four regions we selected had the vast majority of pro and semi pro players.\n\nLooking forward, if the tournament is successful, expansion will be an option. If/when we consider which regions to add to the tournament the number of high elo players will be part of the decision, as we want all of the teams participating in the tournament to be competitive. \n\nSo for all the players who hail from a region which isn't represented - make a case for inclusion. If you're a serious player with pro aspirations get in an OOL team, or rise up the ladder and get picked up by an OCS or OPL team. The more pro/semi pro players from a region, the easier the case is to add them to the tournament.","replies":[]}]}
