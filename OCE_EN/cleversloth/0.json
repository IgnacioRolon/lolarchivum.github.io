As a top laner all she has is strengths. If you get cc&#039;d, dashed on, etc. you just do your flip away. Furthermore she has a massive blind, so even if you do get in on her, you can't AA for damage. \n\nWho counters Quinn? Looking at champion.gg for Quinn, of all top laners, there are a measly 2 that have a better than 50% win rate against her. Am I missing something? Is there some way to play a normal top lane pick into Quinn and win? I&#039;ve played dozens of games now against her, and I can&#039;t think of a single time, no matter who I played, that I won lane. What is her weakness supposed to be?","replies":[{"poster":"Corehog","date":"2016-08-02T05:54:57.484+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Quinn has a few weaknesses.\n\nFor one, CC is really effective against her. Blinds, stuns, roots and slows really bring down her lane pressure. Quinn is supposed to be really mobile, but that can change in an instant, especially since her E \"Vault\" doesn't make her untargetable .\n\nYes, Quinn is quite good at chunking tanks, but only if she can land Harrier on you and also claim that mark before it times out. Dodging her abilities is the easiest way of dominating her, but also charging right into her works. Sure Quinn has her vault and her blind, but at close range, neither of those do much.\n\nQuinn also has a relatively short attack range. \n\nHide behind minions to dodge her Q then wait for her to either waste her E on a minion or you. She's now open and fairly defenceless. Deal as much damage as you can before any of her abilities have come back up.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Gloric","date":"2016-07-31T21:24:02.010+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"As a Quinn main I can assure you, she has weaknesses.\n\nFor 1, even if she goers a bit tanky, Sterakk's and etc., she is still pretty easy to burst/gank. And there in lies another core weakness, she is pretty easy to gank as she can only interrupt/stop 1 person with her E. The same reason she's rubbish in bot lane, because E puts her in more danger when engaging 2 opponents. All you can do is run, bar any specific champ you can E and escape from safely, or hinder their dash, etc..\n\nAnyone with hard CC can hurt her pretty bad. Anyone with a snare or stun, Lux, Ryze, Panth, Swain can be a hassle to deal with with his slow, once he has ult it's really hard to engage him as Quinn often relies on clearing waves and attacking with minion advantage, which is just an advantage for Swain, slow + heals from your minions, etc.. \nAnd then you have champs like Kayle who can deal out a lot more damage early and if out-scales in whatever way, can be run down with slow and ranged burst, not to mention her ult.\n\nShe is a strong counter to traditional tanky/melee top champs, and a great counter at that, but she has plenty of weakness to the lesser played champs.","replies":[]}]}
