Don&#039;t worry if you haven&#039;t played a lot of 5&#039;s before since i&#039;ll be trying to keep strategies, compositions and shot calling as simple as possible and as we learn how we play, will move onto more complex strategies. \n\nIf you&#039;re interested, fill out the form below in the comment section.
