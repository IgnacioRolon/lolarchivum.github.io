I am currently a Silver Jungle Main with a decent champion pool. I currently am the designer for Chiefs ESC (Number one OCE Team) and SIN gaming (Top 8 OCE Team). I&#039;ve been playing LoL for a year now and aim to get to Master division next upcoming season. \r\nI play for at least 3 hours a day (Great waste of spare time haha) and play mainly at night. \r\nI&#039;m just looking for a dedicated player who is looking to rise up through the divisions as well. \r\n\r\nMy overall goal is to get to master and hopefully be in the OPL or even a sub for a team. I work hard for things I set my sights on and just need someone who is willing to do the same. \r\n{{champion:203}}","replies":[{"poster":"Hypnotits","date":"2015-11-02T09:04:18.516+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"s4, jgler and top main","replies":[]},{"poster":"iBoe","date":"2015-10-28T12:46:02.153+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"i would the same but i dont think you will accept b3 trying to get out duo together and we shall work our way up","replies":[]},{"poster":"DannyG420","date":"2015-10-27T08:23:51.955+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I would definitely be down for that, looking for the same thing.","replies":[]},{"poster":"NIghtshadowb","date":"2015-10-27T02:02:12.636+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I could duo queue with you, i am silver too, just reply back","replies":[]}]}
