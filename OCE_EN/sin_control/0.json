He continuously 1 shot Q'd us. In 1 second he did around 2000 damage to a kalista's health. It was not fun at all and I'd say all my team mates were pissed of as well. I do get that there are champs who can stop his Q by silencing or stop his movement speed by slowing him but the reaction time needed for someone to press the button to silence or snare Yi is longer then a Yi's reaction time to Q. His auto attacks with attack speed could 1-3 shot champs with 2000+ health as well.\r\nI think that Yi should be nerfed in a way to make it easier to stop his Q or just him in general because when he is fed it's not fun at all.\r\n\r\n(Yes I get that I am unranked ..... Blah, blah, blah but a champ shouldn't be able to do this. It's just plain stupid.)","replies":[{"poster":"EJ21","date":"2015-02-13T15:28:40.944+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Well if they nerfed {{champion:84}} because idiot's couldn't buy {{item:2043}} {{item:3341}} i don't see why they might not nerf {{champion:11}} \n\n\nHere is the thing OP, {{champion:11}}  is really weak early like really weak if you see him being pick try picking aggressive early junglers who excel at counter jungling i.e{{champion:60}} {{champion:59}} {{champion:64}} {{champion:254}} {{champion:80}} {{champion:102}}{{champion:5}}   they all come to mind, {{champion:11}} needs farm and items to be relevant if you steal his farm or kill him in his jungle he will be irrelevant for a while a tip if you're a laner go to his jungle and steal his camps i.e raptors but leave one behind so he is behind. subsequently {{champion:11}} will often try to split push so if you're the top laner try picking {{champion:24}} {{champion:92}} {{champion:23}} if you're skill with the champs they all have steroid ability's and CC/debuffs which will hinder {{champion:11}} and can kill him and split push as well as him.\n\n\nIf you see {{champion:11}} being pick ( PICK A HEAVY CC CHAMPION **YOURSELF**) don't rely on your team here are some good ones\n\n{{champion:1}}{{champion:22}}  {{champion:201}} {{champion:9}} {{champion:89}} {{champion:127}} {{champion:117}} {{champion:90}} {{champion:33}} {{champion:19}} {{champion:113}} {{champion:72}} {{champion:45}}  cc him and tear him to shreds.\n\n\nP.S I often ban {{champion:11}} and {{champion:35}} because they're not tanks and {{champion:11}} has no CC and I want a tank jungler.","replies":[{"poster":"TrashDonnut","date":"2015-02-13T19:48:47.980+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"> CC him to shreds\n\nI think this sentence gave me cancer.\n\n1) Yi is immune to most CC.\n2) Yi's Q is OP early.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Cabbages","date":"2015-09-03T02:11:33.415+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"WHY IS RIOT IGNORING THIS CHAMP - IT IS NOW 2 YEARS SINCE THEY TOUCHED HIM ITS NOT FAIR","replies":[]},{"poster":"Slim Chaedi","date":"2015-02-13T20:20:51.574+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I had a game in Nemesis draft as Yi, laning.

(Plus seeming I do plan on getting ranked I don't want to be stuck in bronze with kids who don't know how to even use exhaust)","replies":[]}]}]}
