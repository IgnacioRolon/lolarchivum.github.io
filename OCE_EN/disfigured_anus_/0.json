I&#039;ve done loads of research and tried things like PlayOnMac and the WindowsOS (free) but neither of them works for me. Also if you Google &quot;How to play League on a Mac in Canada&quot; the first thing that comes up is some Apple article talking about how it&#039;s only possible to run League on US ports but I don&#039;t think that&#039;s true because I can run the client perfectly fine it&#039;s just when I get into a match of any kind that the performance goes down immensely. \r\n\r\nDoes anyone know of any programs I could use to make League run smoother and actually work?\r\n\r\nI&#039;ve tried doing things to make it better but it just simply doesn&#039;t work, if there are any alternatives that would allow me to play without wanting to gouge my eyes out I&#039;d appreciate it if someone would let me know, it&#039;d be a big help.\r\n\r\nThanks","replies":[{"poster":"Project Xayah","date":"2018-01-18T02:32:26.799+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"1.
