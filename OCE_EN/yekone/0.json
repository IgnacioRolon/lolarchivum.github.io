I love playing shaco and have played him S6 and 5. I think Shaco is perfect the way he is and that he doesn&#039;t need a rework so when i heard of the assassin rework I thought they were going to help him become a better champion. However now, after seeing his new abilities and watching shaclone&#039;s PBE video i realise that shaco rework is a complete joke and will destroy him as a champion. I mean rengar can now get a 1000 AD and still kill someone before they can move their mouse. Kha zix is better and now can get 60% CDR, Talon can parkour and 1 shot at lvl 3. Then you look at Shaco with all his damages halved and you realise how much ******** bullshit shaco rework really is. He will become the weakest champion and if the rework doesn&#039;t get buffed I will quit this game. What are your thoughts and opinions on Shaco and the new changes in S7\r\n\r\nThank you for ruining shaco riot much appreciated","replies":[{"poster":"Dark Warrior","date":"2016-10-26T13:58:10.460+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"they nerf shaco really hard loser RIOT","replies":[]},{"poster":"Nightjar","date":"2016-10-26T11:45:45.404+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"haha yeah I'm going to stop playing shaco even though he's my most played champion. In fact I probably won't play in Season 7 with the changes to assassins and visions and plants, like the jungle has just become less exciting.\n\nThese shaco minirework is feeling like the sion rework treatment all over again for shaco this time. They take a champion that doesn't really suit the meta, is only popular among small groups of players, is deceptively hard to master, or doesn't suit the playstyle they want the overall game to take and then they do a series of minireworks and nerfs to lower the winrate sufficiently and make the playstyle clunky enough such that the original playerbase will not be bothered by a large rework to the champions abilities and lore. Riot has already said they might address shaco in the assassin class update but he's still probably getting a bigger rework down the road. By all these nerfs to shaco's identity as an earlygame assassin and moving more towards one of his niches (lategame mage ap single target nuker) I feel Riot is preparing for a major rework. It's the same thing that happens to every champion that becomes antimeta and reaches a certain age. Poppy, Sion , Taric, Urgot and now Shaco it's just the inevitable flow of time; and maybe new players will like the new shaco, but he won't be the same.\n\nI will definitely miss old shaco and the season 7 jungle looks so lame, but I do wonder what form shaco will be reborn as in the future. Some sort of toymaker control mage? A support? A tank? A toplaner? A midlaner? He's not going to be a jungler and that makes me very sad but maybe his death will give birth to something almost as interesting in the future. I'm unhappy and I might quit league, but if I don't, I am curious to see my old clowns reincarnation.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Erøse","date":"2016-10-26T10:36:45.021+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"You really think Riot is going to listen to your opinion? Sadly, No!\n\nI think riot bases everything off pro play and win rates and doesn't give a damn about what the players have to say.","replies":[{"poster":"Nightjar","date":"2016-10-26T11:51:13.693+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I don't even think they base things around that even. There have been some horrendous champions in terms of winrates who haven't been nerfed or buffed in forever simply because they don't suit the overall 'meta' that riot is trying to engineer. I'm not blaming them though, it's how games work and nerfs/buffs/reworks are more about creating an overall theme and meta for the competitive game and not as directly linked to winrates and proplay than you'd really expect. If everything was based around winrates and proplay the game wouldn't have so much imbalance between the power of 'meta' and 'nonmeta' champions and this is normal since if everything was purely balanced, the game would be a confusing mess with too many options and not enough defined directive.\n\nIt's not a pleasant thought I know, but this is how things work and why even games with running updates and patches have golden ages and times when they must be lain to rest.","replies":[{"poster":"Erøse","date":"2016-10-27T09:30:53.193+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Sadly, MOBA would never be a balanced game.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Fitzky","date":"2016-10-26T08:51:34.488+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"Classic \"I main X champion and I think he/she is perfect and doesn't need any changes blah blah blah\"\n\nBut in all seriousness just suck it up you think Riot is going to listen and be like \"Oh yeah we changed our minds shaco isn't getting reworked LOL get pranked\"","replies":[]},{"poster":"DarkShade918","date":"2018-03-29T03:18:08.172+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Why do people necro...","replies":[{"poster":"Roguestoney","date":"2018-03-29T03:35:52.224+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Always the NA people too...","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Gingerygoodness","date":"2018-03-29T02:52:54.746+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Remove Oracle Alteration from the game.  Make sweeper only available after level 9.  Between plants and control wards, vision must be played out more strategically and traps like SHACO'S boxes and Jhin's traps are not easily removed.  Afterwards, make boxes trigger Liandry's like heimer turrets and zyra plants and maokai's saplings and....well, the point is MAKE AP/HYBRID SHACO VIABLE!!!  Like come on, he already has split damage...at least make his E an adaptive ability so void staff makes sense.  Shaco or Shaco, it you prefer is by nature a Hybrid damage champion.  Plus, weren't they talking about new jg items with control wards built in??  Jeez.  True vision and the like are too accessible.","replies":[]},{"poster":"RonyStark","date":"2016-10-27T09:59:18.426+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Akali main here.
