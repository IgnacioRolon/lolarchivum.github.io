However, as soon as get into this new realm of ranked, I feel as though I'm completely terrible at this game.. The other ranks were fine but when i joined this one.. I become excess baggage and burden my team :(  Are there any methods of progressing further? Or do i just stop playing ranked? It seems to be ruining the experiences of both my team mates and me.. any suggestions?","replies":[{"poster":"NinjaNumber12","date":"2015-02-07T09:09:18.621+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Keep practicing. Play as much as is healthy. You wouldn't be in Gold if you didn't belong there. I don't have experience of that area of elo personally as i'm a scrub who will probably hit bronze 1 out of provisionals but maybe there's a big gap in ability between silver and gold and you're somewhere in between. You'll be good enough soon. Just learn all you can from your team mates.\nWho knows maybe that skill gap exists because it's so early in the season. Between people getting placed where they belong and your own personal growth as a player, it will get easier as the year moves on. :) don't give up","replies":[]},{"poster":"4ce Hunter","date":"2015-02-07T11:43:04.286+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"too many noobs thats why","replies":[]},{"poster":"Mar3thyu","date":"2015-02-07T05:27:49.925+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Down it only makes sense","replies":[]},{"poster":"P1 GTR","date":"2015-02-07T05:24:54.641+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"be like me, stay in bronze, cuz i cant get out","replies":[]}]}
