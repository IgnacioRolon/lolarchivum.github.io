This was partially because of my normals MMR and stuff though.\n\nI'm not sure if your normal MMR had anything impact on your placement. Maybe it does in your very first provisional games if you have never played ranked before, but ranked and normal queues have separate MMR ratings that typically don't impact each other.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"BarryButcher","date":"2014-12-09T05:20:42.756+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"yes. the start of a new season always begins with 10 provisional games which determine your starting rank for that season.\n\nHowever it does take into account what your current rank is when matchmaking those 10 games and calculating your new rank","replies":[]},{"poster":"vicelore","date":"2014-12-10T05:00:26.931+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"MMR is like herpes, Once you have the bad type there is no coming back.","replies":[{"poster":"PervySage79","date":"2014-12-11T05:39:30.073+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=vicelore,realm=OCE,application-id=Ntey9fRZ,discussion-id=5adNIoBV,comment-id=0005,timestamp=2014-12-10T05:00:26.931+0000)\n> MMR is like herpes, Once you have the bad type there is no coming back.\n\nThere is a good type of herpes?","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"PervySage79","date":"2014-12-09T05:32:33.462+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Is there a set formula? or any specific weighting on what the current rank takes on your provisional games?\n\ne.g \n\nIf you were bronze V, but you win all 10 of your provisional games would you be limited to a certain maximum rank? or could you end up Platnum+?\n\nOr if you were challenger and you lost all 10 of your provisional games would you be limited to a certain minimum rank? or would you end up bronze V?","replies":[{"poster":"BarryButcher","date":"2014-12-09T08:28:30.264+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> Is there a set formula? or any specific weighting on what the current rank takes on your provisional games?\n\nYes. there is a minimum and maximum rank you can attain which is limited by your current rating. I'm not too sure on the specifics though. Kind of a hidden secret Riot keep.\n\nThe general idea is that your current rank puts a cap and floor on what your new rank can be. So a Plat person who goes 0-10 probably would still be put into high silver or so. However a Silver person going 0-10 would probably be put in bronze 5.\nPretty sure if you are Challenger level and go 0-10 in placements you'd still be in Diamond 5 or so.\n\nIt also depends on the order you win/lose games and a multitude of other things. For example, going W-W-W-L-L-W-W-L-L-L is better than L-L-L-L-L-W-W-W-W-W. A lot comes down to the MMR level of the games you get in.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Wiggy","date":"2014-12-09T05:45:30.113+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"you sir have a good question, from personal experience i dont think there's a decent formula\n\nlast year i was bronze 1 with 72LP at the end of pre-season, i was happy, whatever i said, ill win some provisionals and end up b2 or something, i won 5/10 of my provs, got sent to b5 0LP, i mean logically it'd be straight back to where i was.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Project Xayah","date":"2014-12-09T04:45:15.683+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"If I'm not mistaken there's a soft reset at the end of this pre-season.
