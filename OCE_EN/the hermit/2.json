This is why i was wondering if u do not have a rank currently, and you only play 9 provisonal games, would that be put into consideration in season 5 even though u dont get into a rank? It may sound a bit weird and it might be hard to get what im trying to say but all help would be appreciated :)","replies":[{"poster":"BarryButcher","date":"2014-12-24T10:10:47.814+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yes but not much. Preseason games dont matter that much, thats why during preseason decay is turned off. So if you never played a ranked game during the season and play 9 during the preseason, it will basically be like never playing since preseason counts for so little. That being said it will have a VERY VERY minor effect (instead of the base 1200 you might have 1180 mmr or some sht)","replies":[]},{"poster":"Sackboy","date":"2014-12-24T07:11:10.402+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I don't understand, at all.\nIf you've never played Ranked your MMR will be 1200, your starting 10 games will either raise or decrease that depending on how you do.","replies":[{"poster":"The Hermit","date":"2014-12-24T07:14:20.520+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"So it doesnt matter if u actaully finish the 10 games? like if u jus play 9 of them, u will still be placed when the new season starts according to the 9 provisonal games?","replies":[{"poster":"Sackboy","date":"2014-12-24T07:23:00.814+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=The Hermit,realm=OCE,application-id=Ntey9fRZ,discussion-id=joTjEUNq,comment-id=00000000,timestamp=2014-12-24T07:14:20.520+0000)\n>\n> So it doesnt matter if u actaully finish the 10 games? like if u jus play 9 of them, u will still be placed when the new season starts according to the 9 provisonal games?\n\nNo when the season starts again you'll have to do another 10 games, as MMR soft-resets.","replies":[]}]}]}]}
