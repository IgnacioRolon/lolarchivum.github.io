I don&#039;t think he knows of\r\nNocturne&#039;s past of Nocturne being zed, but lets take a look at the evidence.\r\nIt is obvious that Graves teamed up with twisted fate, later on, but when he \r\narrived in this time he had to survive and adapt for a little whilst learning.\r\nThis explains his lore about learning all the tricks of the street. After a\r\nwhile Graves met with twisted fate and they were an instant pair and as said\r\nin the official lore of Graves, both he and twisted fate knew the stakes of\r\ntheir arrangement and twisted fate betrayed him. Does this sound familiar to\r\nanyone? Any Wolverine fans. X-men Origins Wolverine. A rugged man who has hi\r\nmind set on killing a specific man teams up with a gambler to fight someone \r\nwho is practically invincible, who else seems invincible, zed. With\r\nhis death animation being him fall into a shadow pit im sure that Nocturne \r\nwould have kept this nifty ability to survive when necessary. But when it \r\ngot to Graves finding Nocturne for their first fight as what happens in X-men\r\nGraves loses his memory and twisted fate betrays him and leaves him, he was\r\ncaptured by people and sent off to a prison where they want to keep Graves\r\naway from others and find out his secrets, with memory loss all he can \r\nare glimpses of his life and the main thing going through his mind, are cards\r\nfrom twisted fate, and the shadows of nocturne, you may think this is crazy\r\nbut think about it, Graves q buckshot shoots three projectiles, his r\r\nCOLLATERAL DAMAGE where he hits his first target dealing major damage and then\r\nexplosive damage hitting others but with less of an impact. his e a dash, who\r\ncan do all these things, wolverine he has 3 claws, and when he jumps at people\r\nwith his claws the first person he hits dies almost instantly, and the rest may\r\ntake damage but most of the time it is not as severe. and he is agile able to\r\ndash at an instant. Anyway you can see the evidence that Graves is apparently\r\nfrom the future but he doesn&#039;t know it because he can&#039;t remember, bunt what he\r\ncan remember is being betrayed by twisted fate because he came back alone (that\r\nwe believe) and he developed a relationship with only one person and then \r\ngetting stabbed in the back, that hurts so he has set out on revenge for the\r\nsimple fact that the only person that he trusted and cared about betrayed him.\r\nBut subconsciously he knows that he is supposed to kill nocturne so he has a\r\nnatural hate of darkness and so the quote &quot;i got your darkness&quot; meaning i got\r\nyou Nocturne, but he doesn&#039;t even know he&#039;s saying this, this is his subconscious\r\ntalking and not him so he can&#039;t figure it out if he doesn&#039;t know it happened.{{champion:104}}","replies":[{"poster":"IYellowI","date":"2015-06-25T01:18:44.650+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"No no no... so many flaws bad 0/10","replies":[{"poster":"monkeyeatcarrot","date":"2015-06-25T06:18:08.813+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I KNOW WHO YOU ARE IRL FAGGUT","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Alamo","date":"2015-06-25T01:32:56.469+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"sorry no ... but good try.","replies":[{"poster":"monkeyeatcarrot","date":"2015-06-25T06:18:33.714+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"may i ask, what is wrong with this theory? just so i can read further into it maybe and answer any queries\nand don't ask yellow he's a friend irl trying to be a dickhead","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"IYellowI","date":"2015-06-25T01:59:27.686+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"Yeah i know right dude. there are so many flaws like.\n\nFlaw 1: Graves grew up in the slums \" Malcolm Graves was born in the back of a Bilgewater tavern and left there with a bottle of spiked milk. He survived a childhood in the pirate-run slums using every dirty trick in the book.\" so how does he learn time travel if he's simply learned every trick in the book. he is not a genius if he did learn to time travel he would be flipping Ekko THE ONLY CHAMPION THAT CAN TIME TRAVEL. Do you think Ekko will reveal his flipping secret to time travel, so this here is a massive gapping hole.\n\nFlaw 2: Nocturne was in the forbidden box of the shadow technique's that so i'm guessing here that is where he learned his ability to cheat death. like zed has via his \"Death animation\".Even if Nocturne was zed from the future how the flipping heck has he learned how to time travel. i'm quoting myself here again \"Do you think Ekko will reveal his flipping secret to time travel, so this here is a massive gapping hole\".\n\nFlaw 3: Riot will not base their champion on movies like graves. the fan base is not big enough for a flipping x-men based set of champions.\n\n> tl';dr stupid theory 0/10 nice try guy. don't cry {{item:3070}} {{champion:63}} {{item:3070}} so don't be salty try again next time. {{item:3070}} {{champion:63}} {{item:3070}} \n\nBut this guy here is URGOD{{champion:6}} {{champion:6}} {{champion:6}} {{champion:6}} {{champion:6}} {{champion:6}} {{champion:6}} {{champion:6}} {{champion:6}} {{champion:6}} {{champion:6}} {{champion:6}} {{champion:6}} {{champion:6}} {{champion:6}}","replies":[{"poster":"monkeyeatcarrot","date":"2015-06-25T06:17:42.798+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I KNOW WHO YOU ARE IRL FAGGUT{{champion:92}}","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Biasedbacca","date":"2015-06-25T06:12:52.279+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Horrid, Spooky and unoriginal dank meme 0/8 not enough dank","replies":[{"poster":"monkeyeatcarrot","date":"2015-06-25T06:18:33.725+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I KNOW WHO YOU ARE IRL FAGGUT","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"xXHDGodXx","date":"2015-06-25T02:01:56.414+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"you tried but it was bad gg...","replies":[]}]}
