To give you a rough idea of how much time I've spent since the first time I started playing, I have roughly played 500 games, and spent just over 600 hours in game since then. I completed my Ranked Provisionals after eagerly reaching level 30, and was put into Silver 5, then I fell backwards pretty drastically, all the way into Bronze 5 and to be honest, I probably deserved it, I wasn't that educated about the game, I didn't really know much at all, no I'm not going to sit here and blame the rest of the Bronze community etc, although you do sometimes wonder why some players do what they do, really.\n\nI jumped the gun too early and thought I was better then what I was, and it backfired on me. And that was when I decided I need to set myself a goal if I want to take this more seriously. My goal I set was to just improve my game as much as I can, and to be able to look back and realise the mistakes I have made, and what I could of done to avoid them. \nI think I really do have some decent potential in me to be able to play with better players, which I feel would be such a rewarding aspect towards my education within League of Legends, thus making my game improve drastically. I have noticed over the last couple of days though, I am being put with players who are from Bronze 2 - Silver 4 even, so I feel as though that is already an accomplishment. \n\nI have taken the time to learn a fair few champions, so I do have a fairly large Champion Pool I can play. Some better then others vise versa.\nI do mainly play Top Lane, and I enjoy ADC quite a lot too. Jungle I like to have some fun in haha, and I don't mind playing Support if I have to, Support gets overlooked by so many, as it is one of the most crucial rolls in a match, I feel anyway. Mid Lane doesn't phase me, to be honest haha.\n\nI do put a good amount of time into researching about every aspect of the game as much as I can, and trying to learn from my higher ranked friends, spectating higher ranked games, watching live Twitch streams pretty much everyday, watching replays from past tournaments etc, All of that. \n \nI really just want to be able to find others on the OCE server, who are wanting to improve with every game they play, and who take the game abit more seriously then those who think it's okay to have a support for top and not your adc, or no jungler, etc. haha.\n\nIf your willing to lend a hand, **podgyo** is my Summoners Name, feel free to add me and say Hello, or even if you have the time to maybe just give me some feedback from what you can see in my Match History even, or if you would go that far into spectating a game, or playing a game with me, and see how I go, just let me know. I appreciate every bit of advice, and constructive criticism i receive.\n\n\n\nHere is a link to my Match History - to be honest this recent week, has been very rewarding for me, I feel anyway, and I think it shows on my Match History, that I am slowly becoming more consistent with my games then what i was doing say 2 weeks ago. \nhttp://matchhistory.oce.leagueoflegends.com/en/#match-history/OC1/201063478\n\n\n\nThanks for taking the time to read this, if any of you even got this far, and I hope to hear from some of you in the near future...","replies":[{"poster":"Jehovahs Witness","date":"2014-12-04T23:07:14.732+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yasei Doubutsu (something like that) can offer help when he gets back actively.

There is no real difference between the skill base unless a new player starts ranking too early and they are clearlyyyy new with like 5 APM.\n\nIf you want some general tips here ya go: \nBe a complete A-HOLE and better your own position above all else. \n\nWhat this means is.... pick AP carry supports ( Annie and Zyra are excellent for this) ... flash for secured kills that have ignite on them and ks. Be a complete jag if you know for a fact you are a better player than your team-mate with 40 cs at 30 mins ( dont laugh it happens). This doesn't mean you abuse them as you do it... you want them on your team. Just say \"Sorry man didnt see ignite\" or \"I need some CS too for wards\". Yea this is severely %%%%ing underhanded and super dooshy but if you want to win and progress you need to advance your position without making an enemy within your own team. \n\nOn the flipside if you see someone on your team make some serious plays, PROTECT AND SUPPORT HIS A-HOLE.  This means if your 0/6 and he is 10/1, you build items that benefit him. ( eg. hp and resistances to bait and tank shots he doesnt have to)\n\nDONT PLAY ADC! I cant stress this one enough.  In low elo ADC's generally suck because of two reasons, one you aren't mechanically there yet and two which is the main reason. Your support and peel doesn't exist.  I wholeheartedly believe carrying as a support has a greater impact than carrying as an ADC does. \nWarding the map, avoiding ganks, CCing etc has a greater say in the outcome of the game than the back liner ADC has that has to get to end game to become relevant. Sad part is, most games end before ADC's become relevant. \n\nWHORE as much CC as you can. The more the merrier. \n\nPlay jungle!! Low elos dont know what wards look like. ABUSE the hell out of this. You get some of the easiest ganks you ever done seen because of this.... and they like to push up as they do it too. If you pull off a successful gank and kill the enemy laner.... go back to your jungle clear a couple of camps and GANK the same dude you just ganked a moment ago. Ganking again right as they re-enter lane is probably the MOST effective gank and the most demoralizing thing you can do in the game. They stroll back into lane tilted because they just got killled, they want revenge, they are full hp and above all else they are thinking \" I just got ganked he wont gank me again\"  and than POW!!! right in the kisser. If you pull off a back to back successful ganks not only will you completely check him out of the remainder of the game but you pretty much incite a whole lot of abuse within their team. \"OMG THIS NOOBS WONT STOP FEEDING!\" \n\nThis brings me to another point, if your good at inciting conflict amongst their team.... DO IT! Im sure you have come across ppl that get so angry at you for Ksing or stealing CS that they are prepared to lose the game out of spite. Well use that to your advantage. \n\nUse the new vision wards in your own jungle!!! The new pink wards are reallly good for protecting your jungle. Yes they cost 125g but they last FOREVERRRRR until killled.... a good spot for them is in the bush over the wall directly behind the Red buff. This is excellent for clearing offensive wards... catching ganks. Rule of thumb place them in shrubs with multiple entries and exits. Higher chance of remaining on the map without being clear while providing great vision. \n\nHope that helps. First two points are better evil tho i have to admit.","replies":[{"poster":"Hughberticus","date":"2014-12-04T10:56:49.142+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"If you want I'd help you bro, I've been playing since the start of season 3 but I'm unranked because I hate playing ranked where everyone's really serious and angry and toxic as %%%% but people I play with tell me I'd be somewhere in silver or gold depending on the team I got.
