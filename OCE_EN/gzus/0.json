Can't lead a team that has their eyes and ears painted on. Helping people out with their roles and all of a sudden they're know-it-all and do fuck all and rage. Every now and then I see good players that actually want to help out and do all the shit good cunts do. This community is by far the worst, mainly because kids know every bloody thing there is to know about LoL and just piss arse around when they should be in bed or doing homework. Probably last season competitively for me, waste too much time on this game.","replies":[{"poster":"Crusader charlie","date":"2015-03-18T22:56:27.913+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"maybe you should try playing a more adult game if you are sick of it that much.","replies":[{"poster":"Chalze","date":"2015-03-19T02:53:14.402+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Crusader charlie,realm=OCE,application-id=Ntey9fRZ,discussion-id=aoakLtEM,comment-id=0000,timestamp=2015-03-18T22:56:27.913+0000)\n>\n> maybe you should try playing a more adult game if you are sick of it that much.\n\n\"Adult game\"...\n\nh-game ;)","replies":[{"poster":"Crusader charlie","date":"2015-03-19T04:26:25.995+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=MageBlades,realm=OCE,application-id=Ntey9fRZ,discussion-id=aoakLtEM,comment-id=00000000,timestamp=2015-03-19T02:53:14.402+0000)\n>\n> \"Adult game\"...\n> \n> h-game ;)\n\nof course ;)","replies":[{"poster":"Chalze","date":"2015-03-19T06:14:43.174+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Crusader charlie,realm=OCE,application-id=Ntey9fRZ,discussion-id=aoakLtEM,comment-id=000000000000,timestamp=2015-03-19T04:26:25.995+0000)\n>\n> of course ;)\n\nThe only 'adult rated' game I really want though is MKX...at least it's not an h-game :P","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"gZus","date":"2015-05-19T08:59:33.095+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Forgot about this post lol, shit still happening 2-3 games in a row. I could play other games is more mature and less frustrating, which is not a bad idea. I used to play a lot more CS:GO in preseason, but came  back to the ranked grind. I don't know, probably just me being a bitch about dumb shit. But seriously, some people have their heads up their arse. Good luck in your ranked games lads","replies":[]},{"poster":"WhisperPan","date":"2015-03-19T04:25:32.677+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Isn't there an adventure time MOBA on CN's website?
