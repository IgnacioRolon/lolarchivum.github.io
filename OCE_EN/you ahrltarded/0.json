I&#039;ve literally just used up my whole months internet today on this stupid fucking patch and it&#039;s most likely something thats not even your fault but your the easy blame so fuck you. \r\n\r\nBack story time. I&#039;m a student so unfortunately living is like a major cost in my expenses and internet is a semi needed thing. I have a little modemy thing that gives me 7 gigs a &quot;month&quot; and I literally reset it yesterday. \r\n\r\nEvery time I try to patch this fucking happens and after going through every quick fixe again and doing the &#039;bull shit repairing&#039; and then deleting this exact file in the folder in the yada. I&#039;m usually left with just reinstalling the whole game.\r\n\r\nSo once again I&#039;ve done that and left it, walked away cooled of a bit pretended to do an assignment, you know uni stuff. I come back and what do I fucking see. Fucking 23 percent done &#039;unexpected error go Fuck yourself&#039; it didn&#039;t even have the decency to pretend to get to 33 or 99 percent. \r\n\r\nLeague cost me $59 today for nothing. Absolutely fucking nothing. And unfortunately I&#039;m stupid enough to try again in a weeks time when I get paid and it&#039;ll be the same fucking thing. \r\n\r\nI honestly hate complaining but this literallry happens every time but now I have to pay for my internet and that shit adds up.\r\n\r\nTLDR\r\nI love you lol. I&#039;m going to continue to play you. But I honestly fucking hate you.","replies":[{"poster":"HORSE OF FORCE","date":"2015-05-16T01:13:06.845+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It's the new patcher.
