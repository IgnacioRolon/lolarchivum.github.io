You guys said that it wouldn&#039;t affect gameplay (as in computers that could run the old map could run the new one) I agree with this but what you didn&#039;t say was the fact that slightly more physical memory (RAM) is used by the new map. I know this because my CPU is quite old and it struggles with the new map but never did with the old one and I did some data gathering. However, that is fine I don&#039;t really mind it still works. My problem is the last 2 patches. I don&#039;t know what was changed but now my CPU is actually freezing mid game for like 2-5 minutes at a time and this happens every game.\r\n\r\nNow because of this I am low priority queue. Which is partially my fault for having a crap CPU but also on you guys for not putting up a disclaimer saying hey! your bad CPU can&#039;t run our game anymore. If I had known this I would have used a friends/family members CPU to play when I wanted to.\r\n\r\nNot really a discussion but I tried to write a complaint and support for OCE is taken to the NA servers and it wouldn&#039;t let me log in which is kinda wierd but yeah anyway I just wanted to have a rant. \r\n\r\nThanks for a great game riot but some heads up would be nice if your gonna make it neigh impossible to run on shitty old CPUs.\r\n\r\nTy for the low priority :)\r\n\r\nBye!","replies":[{"poster":"SqueakierEel","date":"2016-03-05T17:47:05.323+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey StillPrettyNub \n\nSorry to hear about your computer troubles. Just a heads up a 'CPU' is tech lingo for central processing unit, not Personal Computer which is what PC stands for. \n\nA couple things could be contributing to your problem.\n\n* Are you running anything in the background, (Check via opening Task Manager via right clicking your task bar then going 'task manager' from there go processes in the tab section up the top and n priorities Memory.\nFrom here if anything is using up over 500,000K (internet browsers, recording software, itunes ect.) It can basically chew your RAM. You can close these via right clicking and 'end process' (disclaimer, do not close windows explorer)\n\n\n* When was the last time you ran a virus scan? make sure you have an up to date antivirus or anti malware, such as malware-bights, AVG, Spybot search and destroy, Ect. Run a virus scan to make sure you haven't picked anything up recently as this can slow your computer down.\n\n\n* Have you cleaned out your graphics card recently and or does it have proper ventilation. If the card has excessive dust in it or not proper ventilation  (This goes for your CPU aswell) it can cause crashes and hiccups in your game play. (Make sure you always de-static yourself if you plan to open your computer)\n\n\n* Lastly make sure your drivers are up to date, this can be done via either the control panel program that came with your hardware or going onto your hardware providers website and finding  your product to manually install.\n\nI hope this helped out, GL on the rift","replies":[]}]}
