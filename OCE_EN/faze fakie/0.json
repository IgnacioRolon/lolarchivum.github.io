My problem is today I received a skin that is completely useless to me, 'Super Teemo'. Last night I received my first ban/restriction in maybe about 2 years of my 3 years of playing the game. This was a 5 minute lower priority queue and to my satisfaction I still received my mystery gift but to my misfortune it happened to be 'Super Teemo'. Now since I received this ban/restriction last night I would have preferred that I did not receive the mystery gift at all.\r\n\r\nThankYOU RIOT","replies":[{"poster":"Slim Chaedi","date":"2015-01-09T15:45:48.980+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I got Sultan Tryndamere.
