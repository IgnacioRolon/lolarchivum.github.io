BUt still feel free to apply, we'll just get to everyone shortly.\n\nWe are looking for some people to fill in the roles we currently don&#039;t have for our 5v5&#039;s team. The team will mostly be playing from lunchtime to late afternoon (5pm-ish) most days so if this fits your schedule, great!\nOnce we have everyone in a secure spot on the team and get used to the synergy we would like to climb the ranked ladder. We would also like the people that want to play with us be willing to play champions that fit team compositions and co-operate with team play (ie no AFK split-pusherino). As the goal is to play the game seriously and see how far we can go. \nFeel free to leave your IGN below and your main champions, and some info about what type of player you are :) or add me on the client and we can chat there. :)","replies":[{"poster":"very sensitive","date":"2015-08-23T08:56:08.360+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"G5 Adc/mid main with a wide champ pool\nadd me, BryceBruz","replies":[]},{"poster":"Mar3thyu","date":"2015-08-18T13:43:59.630+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Mar3thyu\nAny\nTop","replies":[]}]}
