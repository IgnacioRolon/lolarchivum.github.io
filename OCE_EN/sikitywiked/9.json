Why have all my normals been filled with trio Queue platinum players and just much higher skilled players in general? Usually when i play I can win half of the games but the past few days I&#039;ve had my team and I get utterly stomped. Is it all just because people aren&#039;t playing ranked atm and playing normals instead or did something happen to the matchmaking?","replies":[{"poster":"Ing√©nue","date":"2016-11-10T22:52:41.572+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Nothing actually changed. A big part of what you are seeing will be that higher elo players wont be playing ranked for a while, as they get used to the changes.\n\nNormal matchmaking is completely different from ranked matchmaking and the MMRs are kept separate, so you are going to see a variety of ranks in your games (even if it looks unbalanced). During pre-season/ after major changes this tends to be a lot more noticeable as more people are heading to norms to learn about the changes.","replies":[{"poster":"Sikitywiked","date":"2016-11-11T03:45:52.151+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"That's what I feared, I guess my normals just won't be fun to play for a while. At the very least it's gonna compel me to play better than before","replies":[]}]}]}
