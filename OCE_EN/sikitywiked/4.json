Owls are very elegant, wise and respectable creatures which fits the Shuriman theme, they also have amazing vision which fits into this champions  past and archetype. Being an advisor to Azir, his ability to foresee upcoming attacks benefited Shurima greatly. \nInstead of a golden colour scheme he is silver/grey as he isn&#039;t of royal status.\n\n**Passive idea: Revealing light: **All wards placed by this champion become orbs of light. Once every 30 seconds he can detonate one of his placed wards within 1000 range for a burst of vision (Quinn W), plus a 40% slow on enemy champions within 300 range of the actual detonation. Detonation grants vision of affected enemy champions for 3 seconds. (Stealthed targets will be revealed only if they are within that 300 diameter). The detonated ward is destroyed in the process.\n\n**Q: Fates Thread: **A targeted ability that requires 2 casts, once per target. 600 range. CD:15/14/13/12/11/10.\nTarget enemy champion or minion and within 2 seconds target a second enemy target (champion or minion) to create a tether of light between them. The secondary target receives half of the damage dealt to the primary target while the binding persists and if the tether is broken by distance, both targets are stunned for 1.5  seconds and take moderate magic damage.\n\nAlternatively, bind yourself to allied champion or minion after activating on yourself first.\nIf the second cast is on an allied minion, swap places with the minion. \nIf the second cast is on an allied champion you gain a shield (scaling from AP) and take half of the damage done against them while the bond persists. \nYou cannot bond yourself or allied targets to enemy targets.\nNeutral mobs and epic monsters are treated as enemies and can be tethered to enemy champions with the same effects applying.\n\n**W: Enlighten: ** 800 range. CD: 20/19/18/17/16. A straight line skillshot that explodes into an 80 degree cone which decreases the vision range of all affected enemies like a flashbang grenade (like graves W,  but light instead of darkness) and doesn&#039;t persist on the cast area. It also deals moderate magic damage.\n\n**E: Visionary -Passive- **The champions wards(orbs) gain 5% bonus vision range for every point put into this ability and ward duration is increased by 10 seconds.\nAt max rank, green wards and trinket wards have 125% vision range and last 50 seconds more\n**E- Active**: CD: 30 seconds.\n Ba'ti reveals the enemies weaknesses as he fights, causing his next 3 basic attacks to reduce the targets armour and magic resistance by 2/3/4/5/6% each strike. For a total reduction of 18% at max rank after 3 strikes.\n\n**R: Shuriman Sky- **A burst of multi3coloured light emanates from Ba&#039;ti for 2.5 seconds with a 500 range diameter. All enemy skillshots CAST (not skillshots that are fired outside of the ability range) and movement commands CAST (right click/hold) within this area are reversed/mirrored to travel in the opposite direction. \nE.G if an ezreal is standing to the left of Ba&#039;ti and is within the range of the ultimate, every skillshot he fires right will travel to the left instead.\n\nStrategy/combo: In lane you would establish vision control through river and tri-brush and also a ward infront of the enemy tower (outside of its true vision range).  When a gank is coming you would throw your W onto the enemy champions so they would not be able to see your jungler approaching, bind the enemy targets together while they are blinded and focus the closest target with your damage. The second target has to make the choice of staying near their ally and taking extra damage or leaving them, which would also cause them both to be stunned. The ward behind them can be detonated as they try to escape and slow them enough for your team to collapse and lock them down.\nAfter level 6 the option is to W the enemies flash behind them to activate your ultimate, while they have reduced vision they may try to walk away but instead walk/flash towards your team. Experienced players can outplay this ability by knowing to walk in the opposite direction themselves so that they go the direction they actually want to go etc.\n\nBa&#039;Ti also excels in playing defense. Being able to tank the damage for his carry indirectly by absorbing half of it via his Q and reducing the enemies vision during dives and engages can quickly turn the tides. His ultimate is a great defense during dives and crowded teamfights, the downside is that he doesn&#039;t deal a sufficient amount of damage and lacks sustain. \nAlso he can chain the enemy jungler to Dragon or Baron, meaning that he will take bonus damage being done to the epic monster while trying to steal, or running away only to be stunned before exiting the pit.","replies":[{"poster":"Sikitywiked","date":"2015-04-18T14:45:52.159+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"{{summoner:2}} {{item:2050}} {{item:3363}} {{item:3023}} {{champion:161}}","replies":[]},{"poster":"kJs","date":"2015-04-18T15:23:15.835+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Is that Soren?

Meaning that a sightstone {{item:2045}} would be a core item on him regardless of what role he's played in, although I don't see him being very successful outside of being a support unless the damage scaling on his Q and W were really high.

Tanky but with a little bit of AP mostly to buff his shield a little bit, since it's mostly all utility based :P Plus if he has to be in short range to use his ult, he would have to be durable enough to survive haha.","replies":[]}]}]}
