I used to always get around 35 ping in games but the past week or so it&#039;s bumped up to a stable 60-65. My ISP says nothing has changed on their end and I had them fiddle around to see if they could get it back to how it used to be, but to no avail. So an answer from someone that knows something or a Riot employee would be appreciated :) (because I haven&#039;t seen any announcement on the boards for a server relocation)","replies":[{"poster":"Mindstar","date":"2015-11-17T01:30:36.544+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey Sikitywiked\n\nWe've not changed anything server side recently (certainly haven't moved them!).  It is possible that the path from your ISP to us has changed though.\n\nWhat city are you in, and what ISP do you use?\n\nOne way you can look into this is to [run a traceroute](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752674-Network-System-and-League-of-Legends-Logs#wq2) to the OCE servers, which will show you the actual path that your packets take.\n\nCheers\nMindstar","replies":[]}]}
