One that benefits from running away from other champions, lets say for example his/her passive would be the opposite of Vayne's (movement speed running away from enemy champs) and the core mechanic of the champion would be along the lines of setting traps, being safe and being over all passive-aggressive.\r\n\r\nA champion that hates fighting because of their personality (being scared of the big bad monsters and macho guys with weapons) so attempts to win the game via other routes such as pushing lanes, taking towers and helping teammates via buffs or other utility. I guess the overall feel is someone that isn't 'heroic' and is a regular person that relies on his/her wit and careful planning. To play the champion you would need to cooperate with your team and bait the enemy team in, lets say if he/she had a devastating pit-fall trap for example as their R, one that you set somewhere in the map and click the button again to activate (could last a few minutes in game). Something that if done properly could win the teamfight.\r\nThink of a bigger AOE Teemo-shroom that wouldn't activate until you pressed R, rooting everyone in an area (curse of the sad mummy). The counter-play of course here is that a sweeping lense would reveal the trap, it would have more health than a shroom though. Maybe 5 hits like a pink ward?\r\n\r\nI think Zaun would be a great city for this champion to come from, being a 'dog eat dog' kind of place which people get away with anything in, someone that makes their due by knowing how to deal with scary and intimidating characters because they have had to survive in that place their whole life. In the League wiki it says that espionage and sabotage are a part of daily life in Zaun. Becoming a champ in the league of legend could be their lucky ticket to leading a new life away from that harsh and filthy place.\r\n\r\nSo for clarity's sake I'll write up a quick ability list.\r\n(Champion name) The Coward of Zaun!\r\n(mid ranged champ, like Thresh- He doesn't want to get too close to the enemy) His weapon would be a sling-shot. (Think Usopp from One Piece)\r\nPassive: Gains movement speed when running away from enemy champions.\r\n\r\nQ: Caltrops: tosses a handful of caltrops to a small targeted area which does a little damage and gives a micro-slow (trundle Q), can be stepped on 3 times before expiring. (short cool-down, spammable)\r\n\r\nW: Inside info/weak spot: Reduce the targets armour and magic resist for a short time. The champ and teammates do 5-10% increased damage to target for 2 seconds\r\n\r\nE: Panic: The champion doubles the amount of speed his passive gives for 1 second (draven W, but only useful if running away) and leaves 3 caltrops where the ability was used.\r\n\r\nR: Pop goes the weasel! : First cast causes the champion to channel for 1.8~ seconds which places a large pit-fall trap in the designated area (lasts 5 minutes). Second cast will activate the trap, causing all enemy targets to be rooted for 2 seconds and take damage based on their bonus AP/AD (so it will be a good come-back ability and devastating late-game.\r\nPassive: Every point put into this ability causes the champ to coat his Caltrops in Zaun chemicals, making enemies burn for 2% of their max health for 2 seconds.\r\n\r\nI didn't do scalings because I think I would get them completely wrong >.>\r\nThanks for reading though, I hope the concept of the character is at least something riot might consider, the abilities are just shots in the dark :D","replies":[{"poster":"newbie78773","date":"2015-01-21T00:44:07.230+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Honestly... this seems like itd be a fun champ to play","replies":[]}]}
