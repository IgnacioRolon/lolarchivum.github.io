Who is this guy meant to be?\nI linked a picture above of what general design i'd like him to be. A white Rabbit character with traditional, possibly Ionian inspired clothing. A samurai without a sword.\nThe design inspiration for the character comes from  Usagi Yojimbo (in photo) mainly as he was the only similar character i could think of as a reference.\n \n*LORE:* Somas is another celestial being (edit: or simply chosen by the celestial beings?), similar to Soraka but with obvious differences. There are references in Asian and Aztec cultures of white rabbits (moon rabbit) creating or being in the possession of the elixir of life, or philosophers stone. Again, similar to Soraka this character instead of living inside some magical grove, is tasked with the protection of the Fountain of Youth/Holy Grail. The fountain itself resides in its own magical realm inside of a jug/cup that Somas carries. As its keeper he has the ability to call upon the powers of the fountain and its miraculous properties. The jug/cup is also fitted with a mysterious stone (Nami's lore anyone?) In order to keep the Fountain a secret, Somas secluded himself to living high up in the mountains where there would be a much lower chance of people finding and possibly taking it from him. The high altitudes are combated by the fountains healing properties, he doesn't suffer any lack of oxygen and the water keeps him nice and toasty (and he's fuzzy). He doesn't require food either as its nourishing enough. \nSomas pretends to be a very patient and wise person as it's who he should be because of the responsibilities he has. But in reality he gets annoyed very easily and can act quite immature when his peace and quiet is disrupted. He is a young man, energetic and enthusiastic about jokes and is interested in non-human women aside from Yordles. (Fishy lady, goaty lady).\nHe joins the league for a few reasons, one is because of his knowledge that celestial beings are also fighting, he has a strange calling to Nami but isn't quite sure why (dem fins doe).\n\nAbilities: I haven't created names for the majority of them yet and I honestly wouldn't know where to start with scalings.\n\n**Passive**: Tranquility ? : All Allied champions within a moderate range of Somas have reduced ability costs. Starting at 5% and scaling up to 15% at max rank of his ultimate. Meaning at level 5, an ability that would normally cost 100 mana or energy etc would only cost 95. This helps his lane partner to be ever so slightly more 'spammy' in lane to ascertain lane dominance over the opponents.\n\n**Q: **Targeted ability with a decently short range (580 range). A whip-like torrent escapes the cup to strike a nearby enemy target. relaxing their body to the extent of going limp, slowing for 20% and reducing the targets armour and magic resist for 5% for 1.5 seconds. And increases debuffs by 1% for every 500 of Somas' current mana.\n8 Second cooldown\n\n**W: **Somas soaks himself OR targeted ally in the divine water, consuming 10/12/14/16/20% of his maximum mana to imbue chosen target with 10/12/14/16/20% of all Somas' combat stats for 3 seconds. (mini Singed R but scaling percentage-wise).\nSo basically if you build like a tank, you'll make the target tankier and if you build damage you will make the target hit harder etc. This ability will match your playstyle and create diversity in item builds between players.\n20 Second cooldown.\n\n**E:** A geyser of hot water erupts from the jug/cup in a 80 degree cone in font of Somas (500 range) which blinds enemies for 1 second and deals moderate magic damage. If the enemy is currently affected by the Q, the slow is tripled to 60% and the target is blinded for 2 seconds instead of 1. \n\n**R:** Somas summons the fountain of youth to a target location for 4/6/8 seconds. (targets that are hit with the fountain are displaced slightly, the same as trundle pillar) Fountain has a 60 range diameter and has an 800 effective range from the centre.\nWhile the fountain is active all allied champions within the effected area gain 10/15/20% lifesteal and spellvamp and 5/10/15% cooldown reduction.\nThe fountain has a deteriorating healthbar (Azir turret but dies much faster) that can be targeted by enemy basic attacks in order to destroy it.\nWhile the fountain is active, Somas' Q hits all targets within the affected area for half of the damage and reductions it normally gives and are still susceptible for the slows to be tripled by the E if they are hit with the AoE Q. The ground is covered by the fountains water lightly so the Q's would come up from the ground to hit the enemies.\n\nSomas has no hard CC, only slows and buffs/debuffs. The ult has **counterplay**, with enough peel and coordination the enemy team can take town the fountain before Somas' allies can get on top of them. However if they are caught by the AoE Q's before they do so, their team is slowed and have resistance debuffs already so running away isn't quite simple without blowing some type of dash, ability or flash. If they choose to not destroy the fountain ASAP, they will be fighting a team that is healing for alot and can spam abilities much more frequently. Meaning an overall increase in damage, survivability and CC potential.\nThe champion that Somas chooses to W in the time of a teamfight, if they also have the buffs from the fountain, that character would be a monster to take down within those 3 seconds. \n\nThe theme I was kind of going for here was the never-ending bountifulness of the fountain, creating a seemingly endless supply of resource for more abilities to be cast in a short amount of time. Put the fountain up just outside of the baron pit for an amazingly fast and safe baron call. Set up the fountain right in-front of or behind an enemy turret for a more successful dive. Basically I want to the team to feel revitalized all the time when they fight by Somas' side. To not grow tired during the fight. Extending sieges, if Somas can catch someone out with a Q E combo, that target has to blow their flash or otherwise be marked for death. They would be slowed significantly and blinded for an adequate amount of time. Also if it were the enemy ADC that was combo'd, the blind would make them basically useless and a sitting duck because kiting and lifestealing wouldn't work at all.\n\nThe magic of this champion to me, is that you can **build however you want to play the champion**. If you choose to play extremely tanky, you're going to make your ally tanky also, if you want to build speed, you'll make your teammate faster. Or you'll give them more AP for burst potential.  Or you could build AD and attack speed to make your ADC a god for 3 seconds.\n\nAn effective build for Somas would be heavily reliant on a large mana pool with cooldown reduction and tankiness in order to not be bursted down immediately when he initiates with his  full W(self)>Flash>R>Q>E combo. \nOr W(ally)>Flash>R>Q>E.\n\nSome items you would build on Somas: Talisman of Ascension(or righteous glory), Frozen Heart (or gauntlet), Athenes Unholy Grail(Or Mikaels Crucible), tear of the Godess, sightstone, Banshees or Spirit Visage, Zekes herald (IKR?), Locket of the Iron Solari and your choice of boots.\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n**TL;DR\nTitle: Somas, the Keeper of the Fountain\nRole: Support\nDesign: Rabbit warrior that wields the holy grail and has water powers\nPassive: Reduces the cost of abilities of nearby allied champions which scales with his ultimate.\nQ: Short range water whip that slows and reduces resistances.\nW: Soaks yourself or ally in the water and gives the target buffs to all of their stats scaling with whatever Somas builds\nE: A geyser of hot water in a cone infont that blinds enemies and triples the slow if affected by the Q\nR: Summons the fountain of youth in target location which gives allied champs, CDR, lifesteal and spellvamp scaling with levels. And makes the Q an AoE ability inside the target area.**\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\n**Some things that he could say**\n\nIn general- 'Now that's what I call high quality H20\"\n\"You people are drinkin' the wrong water\"\nReturning to fountain- \"The water boy just needed some water!\"\n\nTo Soraka- \"You drive me bananas\"\nTo Nami- \"Water you doing later?\"\nTo Gragas- \"I'll have what he's having!\"\nTo Singed- \"Side effects may include; balding and athletes foot.\"\nTo Yasuo- \"Sake it to me\"\nWhen taking a tower or securing an objective- \"A round for all my friends, on me!\"\nWhen buying Athenes or chalice- \"What?

I do like the resource reduction on the passive, I'd maybe take the ult down a notch and maybe just give a reduced amount of CDR, like 10% being the max amount. Take away the other stats on it and just have the resource regen. So how about a resource version of Jannas ult? Just top everyone off for mana etc. Pretty useless for someone like Zed or Riven though, but a Xerath/Caitlyn would be happy. OH, what about making the W instead of doing those massive buffs make it so that for the remainder that they are soaked they have bonus CDR and use Somas' mana as a substitute. \nIdk, my mind just goes on and on when thinking of those types of things.","replies":[{"poster":"DiamondAries","date":"2015-02-23T04:23:31.087+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I think the ult might have to be based entirely on Spell Vamp, Life Steal, and increased flat Health Regen per second.

The Q itse;f wouldnt be that long a cooldown, but the E and W would be at least Blitz hook cooldown-y. \nLike an Annie support without the stun, plus he is melee so he can't harass in lane as much. The speed boost for himself would be able to get him more in range for the combo and to assist with setting up a gank. And I figured the tripled slow was passable because 60% isn't all that bad when he has to expend all of his damage output for it compared to something like Vel'Koz who has a 70% slow every 6-7 seconds only on his Q and it pretty long range. But I like the idea of giving everyone spellvamp etc and healing, since technically everyone uses health and not everyone uses a resource that's replenish-able. And I chose blind because I feel like there needs to be a support with a blind, only teemo, Quinn and I can't remember any other champs atm with a decent blind. And protecting your ADC from the autoattacks from the enemy carry while kiting back with Q's for them is the idea of that effect too.
