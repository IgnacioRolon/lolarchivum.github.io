I am no pro and do make my fair amount of mistakes in games (hence I am in Silver).  The current LoL community will flame you from your first error till the end of game.  How is anyone meant to enjoy their games?.  I usually end up muting the flamer, keeping my head down and trying my best to not screw up again, but by then the game is already ruined.  (and it's even worse when they RQ)\n\nCurrently, the main deterrent for toxic players is the fear of bans.  Is that enough though, how about all those games before that ban finally happens where other team members must suffer.  I honestly am not even sure if the &quot;Report verbal abuse&quot; button has any major effect on the banning of a person.\n\nBut how about we put them in some toxic pool.  That being, we are already able to identity who good players are (&quot;Friendly&quot;,&quot;Helpful&quot;,&quot;Honorable Opponent&quot;).  Those flags indicate good &#039;non-toxic&#039; behavior.  We can also identity toxic players by the reports made on them.  \n\nIs it possible to create a toxic pool.  Chances are there will be a high chance of RQ, AFK, feeding and losses, but this may be a great way to re-align the player and make them want to be a team player.  \n\nCurrently this would be difficult to implement, given dynamic queues, finding teams of equal strength, getting your role and maintaining a reasonable queue time.  Even if it is difficult to single out toxic players, perhaps it is even possible to find these good players, with the flags mentioned above, and increase their chances of playing with one another.  If a player has been voted helpful 100+ times, give them this perk, let them play with similar helpful friendly players.  Don&#039;t let them support tyler1!\n\nTL;DR\n\ntoxic players --&gt; toxic stew (increase their odds of playing with other toxic players)\nnon-toxic players --&gt; gaming heaven (with no extra salt ;)(increase their odds of playing with similar non-toxic players)","replies":[{"poster":"Tele","date":"2016-06-05T04:56:26.347+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey summoner!\n\nToxic behavior can get really heavy on our minds sometimes and it becomes hard to deal with.\n_**This is what I recommend you try:**_\n\n+ **You do you.**\n When you get in-game, you have to play for yourself not anyone else. Keep what others say in mind, especially if it's a helpful tip, but otherwise don't worry about them at all.\n\n This can require a whole personality change for some people, but it's by far the most effective way. If you play like you're always scared of messing up, you'll never improve.\n\n+ **It was Riot's fault!**\n Last season I was in Silver but playing against Platinum players occasionally. I was always getting outplayed and holding the team back. \n\n Whenever someone said: _\"how are you so bad?\"_ or  _\"this support...\"_ \n\n I'd reply with: _\"Riot's matchmaking is so bad right? Why am I even here XD\"_. \n\n This takes the blame away from you and towards **Riot**, to give you a bit of breathing room. Most players actually understand that you're doing your best, but are just frustrated that they didn't get a better team.\n\n> **As for your idea;**\n> \n> You might be interested in what **Lyte** (previously the Head of the Player Behavior Team) said about a similar idea. He dubbed it \"[Prisoner's Island](http://forums.na.leagueoflegends.com/board/showthread.php?t=4796564&page=2#post49503485)\".\n> \n> Personally I'm more in favour of reform as the model for League's punishment system, but there's no reason why this couldn't be a viable option if it's handled carefully.\n\nI hope those tips help a little ;)","replies":[{"poster":"Fitzky","date":"2016-06-09T05:11:50.301+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Watch out there you start blaming riot for stuff they might get angry","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"OccamsTaser","date":"2016-06-09T04:36:12.656+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I usually start the game by muting my team.
