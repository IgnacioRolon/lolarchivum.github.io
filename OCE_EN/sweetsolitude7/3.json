Even just 2 months ago.\r\n\r\nHowever as of these past 2 weeks all attempts at purchasing riot points results in a:\r\n\r\n&quot;Error Unable to perform this transaction..... please contact your card provider&quot;  (or something along those lines)\r\n\r\nCant remember the full error, and when I try to recreate the error I get:\r\n\r\n&quot;Error you have exceeded the maximum number of attempts at this time.  Please wait 24 hours and try again&quot;\r\n\r\nI just used this Visa card after these errors and have managed to make purchases from Ebay and AliExpress.\r\n\r\nAny technical support, ideas?  Would not want to miss out on the mystery discounted skins I received :)\r\n\r\nThanks!","replies":[{"poster":"SephirothSG","date":"2016-06-11T10:20:30.741+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey there,\n\nHave you tried [contacting Player Support](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/requests/new)?
