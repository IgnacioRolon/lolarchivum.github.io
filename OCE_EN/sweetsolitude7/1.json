Who in their right mind, trolling even, would say such hateful words.  Mute him, down vote me, don&#039;t play if you cant handle this negative attitude.  It does not matter, this crossed a line that never should have been crossed in any game.","replies":[{"poster":"Tele","date":"2016-08-05T08:53:48.549+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Hey summoner,\n\nI 100% agree with you. This kind of behaviour has no place in League, and it's quite disheartening to see some players choose to act this way. \n\n_As for his punishment:_\n\n+ The [Instant Feedback system](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/207489286-Instant-Feedback-System-FAQ-) would have issued any disciplinary measures in this case. While I can't honestly say he was perma-banned for sure (especially if this was his first offence), it is very likely that he's skipped directly to more severe punishments such as a 14 day ban.\n\n If he continues this he'll be banned very quickly (usually at most 2 - 3 games of severe offences).\n\nThere's always progress to be made here IMO. The instant feedback system is working better than most people give it credit for, but as you can see it's not perfect and there's still plenty of toxicity in League.\n\nI'm really glad you brought this up though. Having a healthy discussion and highlighting the issues, is the first step to a finding solution to the problem :) ","replies":[{"poster":"Exarch Leona","date":"2016-08-06T02:28:54.463+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":">No place in League\n>Is condoned\n\nLeast you \"tried\"","replies":[{"poster":"Tele","date":"2016-08-06T03:11:26.906+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Can you elaborate?

At least to me, Riot's stance towards negative behaviour doesn't suggest they accept or approve it. Just because the system in place is not as strict as it could be and does not consistently convey how, when and why reported players are punished doesn't mean that they have given up on player behaviour entirely. If Riot were to be seen as condoning anything it would be the ability to type any combination of words in the chat, regardless of content, which is always problematic in an anonymous online space.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Essembie","date":"2016-08-05T07:33:47.670+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Usually I am a mute and move on kind of dude but sometimes trash talk crosses a line.","replies":[{"poster":"veeh","date":"2016-08-10T06:40:14.016+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"yeah but if you do that then you can't come on the forum to complain about how hurt you are.
