I have actually disabled alt + tab using AutoHotKey scripts\n\nTo recreate, hold tab, hold alt, then release tab.   The game minimizes.\n\nI have bound my tab to attack move.  My self casts are alt + spell.  Sometimes when I press them too fast, my game minimizes.\n\nIs this tab + alt behavior intentional? and if so is there a way I can override it.\n\nThanks!","replies":[]}
