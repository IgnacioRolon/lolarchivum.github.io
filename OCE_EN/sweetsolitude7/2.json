DFG leblanc, duskblade zed.  But how about that new passive (eternity) of Rod of Ages on Swain.  I just had the pleasure of laning against one, and as per usual when doing so, engage with ignite or grievous wounds, or when he is low on mana.\r\n\r\n1)  Can ignite really work on him now, before it was just a heal from his ult, however now he also has a heal from RoA\r\n2)  With the new RoA, the more I attack him, the more mana he gets.  The more mana he gets, the more health he gains from his ult, and while spending mana on his ult, gains back more health.  \r\n\r\nSuch a vicious cycle :(  Any views on how to counter this guy atm?","replies":[{"poster":"Requiemsfire","date":"2016-05-07T03:28:36.388+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Even so grevous wounds from ignite, mortal reminder, and morellonomicon will still lower the amount of healing RoA grants him.  if you CC him during his ult or use {{item:3165}}  and {{item:3033}} and deliver burst to him I very much doubt he'll survive. RoA also can't really keep you up in mana by losing HP, or keep your HP by using mana. Eventually you'll run out of one of them to use and his ult is very costly in terms of mana. \n\nThe heal from RoA is kinda small anyways. I mean it's enough to make a difference in the laning phase but when it comes to team fights I doubt it'll do much in the long run beyond saving you with a very small portion of HP left.\n\nI think this change gives a bigger buff to {{champion:13}} and {{champion:27}} ","replies":[]},{"poster":"JesusForgotHisGA","date":"2016-06-04T05:10:16.705+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Ban him at champ select? I also feel he's pretty broken at the moment and especially hard to deal with. Forcing teams to take multiple ignites, build morello etc to deal with one person is a bit of a joke.","replies":[]}]}
