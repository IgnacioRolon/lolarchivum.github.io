I&#039;m not asking for boosts, I&#039;m only asking for help. PLEASE help me.\n\nI main Morgana support with the occasional Blitz and Malphite. I have been looking into Wukong jungle just to help me get out of bronze because I have been told that maining support in bronze is pretty much a ticket to plastic 5.\n\nIf anyone is confident with Wukong Top or Jungle could you please add me in game or leave a comment. I am really interested in playing Jungle but if someone knows about top, I am fine with learning top. I would like to play Jungle because I see so many junglers win the game for their team. I am interested in learning any jungler but others might take longer to learn because I havnt played most of them.\n\nI am from Perth Western Australia and I usually play between 5pm-10pm and sometimes 11pm-1am","replies":[{"poster":"Olee","date":"2015-09-03T01:10:30.813+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Also, for support specifically, maining one champ over others isn't always the best idea. Supports, in my opinion are categorised into three different tiers, Peel, Engage and both. I'm not a support main but I play a pretty good Thresh and I play him 99.9% of the time I have to play support because he's versatile as fuck and I don't consider myself a support main, but for someone who mains support it's good to at least learn three champs in all different tiers, for example:\n\nEngage: Leona, Alistar, Annie\nPeel: Janna, Nami, Lulu\nBoth: Thresh, Braum, Morg\n\nKnowing what support to pick at what time is key too. If they have a very \"dive-y - assassin-ey\" team comp and you think your ADC is gonna get furked, pick Janna to keep your AD alive. If you have a fragile late game scaling AD like Kog, pick Nami for lane sustain. If you have a really aggressive early game ADC like Graves, Leona or Annie will do wonders. If you have a very pick based team comp like with an LB mid and a Kha'Zix jungle, Morg will be good to emphasize your pick comp. If your team has really really good AOE and teamfight, pick Ali for sick one shot wombos. If your team just needs a tank in general, pick Ali. If you don't know who you're laning with/against, pick a versatile support. If the enemy team has lots of projectiles that you feel like you have fast enough reflexes to block, pick Braum. If you're not sure or never sure who to pick, just pick Thresh.","replies":[]},{"poster":"McRuthless","date":"2015-09-03T00:58:38.607+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"In my experience support is one of the easier roles to carry with in lower divisions so don't believe the people who say you can't climb by maining support, though I'd recommend being decent at at least a couple other roles too so you dont feed when you can't get support.\n\nSome tips:\n\n- Roam a LOT. You will rarely carry games by staying in your own lane. Always look for opportunities to roam and snowball mid and top.\n- Try to ward the enemy jungle so you can make plays on their jungler if you see them low, good times to do this are when you are pushed to enemy tower or you see their jungler on the other side of the map.\n- Always look to identify the players/champions that are most likely to carry the game so you can focus on snowballing/protecting the ones on your team, and shutting them down on the enemy team. Don't blindly feel like you should be peeling for your adc if it's apparent they don't know what they're doing and you have a 5-0 top laner that will win the game for you if you protect them instead.\n- Don't follow the adc around for no reason. After the first 10-15 mins, and especially once bot tower is down, your time is usually better spent grouping with the rest of your team and warding/making plays around the rest of the map.\n- Look at the minimap a lot. Also use a lot of pings since your teammates probably aren't looking at the minimap","replies":[]},{"poster":"Buffpeanut","date":"2015-09-02T22:22:02.450+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I got out of bronze as a support so surely you can too. \nAdd me in game and I'll give you a game and tips from there","replies":[{"poster":"Buffpeanut","date":"2015-09-02T22:24:37.083+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"But a few quick tips might be:\n- make the calls for your team (if you are confident)\n- don't rage at them\n- learn to use your blackshield while the enemy stun is in midair\n- learn when to push the lane and when to freeze or when to ward","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Torea2","date":"2015-09-08T23:36:23.659+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Dont play Wukong jungle-its not worth the pain and effort\n\nfirst clears are hard and then his ganks are exceedingly average and without boots you cant do anything good at all","replies":[{"poster":"GPuL Megg","date":"2015-09-09T10:51:17.936+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"do you even think he is worth top lane? \n\nanyway I have started to play poppy jungle, she seems to be op as sh!t.
