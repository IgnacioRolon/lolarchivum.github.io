Was in a ranked lobby, everything seemed fine, no dc's, after the countdown hits 0 whenever everyone has picked/locked in their champs the game client disappears (no loading screen). On task manager, the game client doesn't appear on the applications tab however the processes do. Tried waiting a few minutes yet nothing happened. Closed the processes and opened up the client again, tried reconnecting however to no avail, same thing happened and i can't connect to the game.\r\n\r\ntl;dr - CANT CONNECT TO THE GAME, WTF!","replies":[{"poster":"HORSE OF FORCE","date":"2015-03-26T10:54:05.135+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Are you on Mac or PC (or even Linux!)?
