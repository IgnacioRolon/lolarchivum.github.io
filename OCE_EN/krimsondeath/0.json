Work on consistently getting it and perhaps work on safely farming in tough lanes.\nI suggest doing customs alone with no bots where you just CS to get a bit of practice (like an occasional 5 minute one). Then the same but with one bot and the same with two bots. That way you need to be mindful of harass too. This'll help you learn to farm safely and recognise the order in which the minions will be down to last hitting health.","replies":[{"poster":"KrimsonDeath","date":"2015-04-26T08:30:37.639+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thank you man :)","replies":[{"poster":"KrimsonDeath","date":"2015-04-26T08:37:52.374+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=KrimsonDeath,realm=OCE,application-id=FjGAIbRv,discussion-id=GwjXKIOa,comment-id=00040000,timestamp=2015-04-26T08:30:37.639+0000)\n>\n> Thank you man :) and someone told me that botrk improves his dueling ability and lategame was he trolling me?","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"BarryButcher","date":"2015-04-26T06:27:47.491+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"LOL deleted the old thread huh? Don't ask for advice if you can't handle the truth buddy.\n\nYou will be surprised how much simply farming better will help you climb. Aim for 60 at 10 mins and 140 by 20 mins. You will no doubt have 30-40 cs more then anyone else in Bronze 4 which means you should have an item advantage and people never look at item disparity in Bronze\n\nYou also have a 10-29 record in ranked this season and are 3-7 in your last 10. Correct if im wrong, but that isn't a 50% record.\n\nEDIT: OHHH you said when you play \"seriously\" you go 50-50... oh... my bad. I assumed this thread was about a guy asking for help climbing because he always tries.\nHeres a tip: how about you dont \"mess around\" in ranked if you want to climb because all you are doing is ruining your MMR which makes climbing extremely hard. The more you lose, the harder it is to climb.\n\nhttp://oce.op.gg/summoner/userName=KrimsonDeath","replies":[{"poster":"KrimsonDeath","date":"2015-04-26T08:22:54.296+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Im sorry but I know that and the previous set of games I last played in LoL ranked I had mindset issues and trying to work up from a few losses before that sadly I ended up getting more losses instead And playing a champion \"Kha'Zix\" I thought I had mastered but turned out I had alot to learn but thank you for the cs tips\nAnd like I said in my other thread I am alot better than when i did alot of those further back ranked games in my first promo series I only won 2 out of 10 and now I am certain I could get atleast 5 So yes its not 50% stats but when i tend to play it ends up 50/50 wins and losses\n\nWhen I recently started playing ranked again other games were like 2 months ago was those xin'zhao & zed games and thats when I noticed I have improved but than I ended up dropping to b4 when  I played khazix and its gotten a bit harder atleast you've told me that thanks.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"super sexy monk","date":"2015-04-26T01:45:11.250+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Lets be honest here, your main priority should be to fix your attitude.\n\nJust reading that post I can tell you are just one giant douche.
