If it lands, immediately mash q then e while autoing them...if they are still alive, keep autoing and press w/e buttons you have open. If they die, make sure to say LOL GJ SCRUB MEXICAN in all chat. If, by some freak chance they escape or kill you, be sure to call them a fing hacker in all chat. Go back, buy items, kill more stuff. Continue doing this until the \"teamfight\" stage where you should be helping your team push and obtain objectives. At this stage of the game, you must, as a Lee player, run around alone in the enemy jungle hunting enemy champions. If you happen to die, you should say GG NOOB FEADER TEAM SCRUBS GG ******S STOOPID RIOT GIV ME BAD TEEM in all chat.
