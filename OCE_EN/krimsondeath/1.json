From what I can see on op.gg, your MMR is really low, there's no easy way to raise it. But if you keep winning games, winning more than you are losing, your MMR will go up, and getting 50% overall win rate will help, which really you could probably get quite easily within another 100 games.\nSo just keep playing, and improving, I'm trying to get out of Bronze as well! Add me if you want to duo.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"JasonWazza","date":"2015-08-24T13:56:24.424+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You have a negative win rate, why do you think you should be able to climb?\n\nEven in your last 20 you only have a 55% win rate.","replies":[{"poster":"KrimsonDeath","date":"2015-08-24T14:27:18.170+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I started ranked when I was a noob and had tons of losses at bronze 5, I used to be over 100 more losses than wins I have improved hugely since when I started ranked and believe I can make silver, I dont usually lose much last week I had a winrate around 80% just having a bad week right now, I dont see why all responses have to be rude of people claiming I cannot climb when I know I can, some people just get jealous new people are getting into the ladder.","replies":[{"poster":"JasonWazza","date":"2015-08-24T15:28:00.036+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The fact that you find this rude is sad, it's not rude it's honest.\n\nFact is i don't care if you climb or not, and i'm not going to be jealous all the way up here in gold, what i am telling you is that just because you think you deserve to climb doesn't mean you should be able to, fact is regardless of why you have a low win rate, you have it, meaning it's harder for you to climb, as your MMR (not your LP) climbs, then you will actually be able to climb.\n\nYou coming in here to bitch and expecting to be asskissed is just sad.","replies":[{"poster":"KrimsonDeath","date":"2015-08-25T07:44:09.486+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=JasonWazza,realm=OCE,application-id=Ntey9fRZ,discussion-id=pPaffTLo,comment-id=000100010000,timestamp=2015-08-24T15:28:00.036+0000)\n>\n> The fact that you find this rude is sad, it's not rude it's honest.\n> \n> Fact is i don't care if you climb or not, and i'm not going to be jealous all the way up here in gold, what i am telling you is that just because you think you deserve to climb doesn't mean you should be able to, fact is regardless of why you have a low win rate, you have it, meaning it's harder for you to climb, as your MMR (not your LP) climbs, then you will actually be able to climb.\n> \n> You coming in here to bitch and expecting to be asskissed is just sad.\n\n\n\", fact is regardless of why you have a low win rate, you have it, meaning it's harder for you to climb, as your MMR (not your LP) climbs, then you will actually be able to climb.\"\n\nThankyou. for the actual little information stored inside of why you dont care and yes I can climb since I have proven to myself I can escape bronze 5 and 4 multiple times.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Talon12","date":"2015-08-25T02:34:59.286+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"well guess what, rito said people were supposed to be able to climb with a 45-50% winrate regardless of their mmr, riot just stuffed up their scoring and its not working properly. a 60% winrate should be definitely climb, but it doesn't, no one seems to be able to climb atm unless they can get up a rank without losing before, or they have winrate of around 70%-75%+","replies":[{"poster":"JasonWazza","date":"2015-08-25T07:12:16.200+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"a 60% win rate will help you climb over time.\n\nFact is if you fucked your MMR that bad, you need to climb from where you fucked your MMR, just because your league doesn't reflect that, doesn't mean that is the case.\n\nFor example, i may be gold 5, but currently my MMR is High silver 2, Low silver 1, and i am basically climbing from there again.","replies":[{"poster":"Talon12","date":"2015-08-25T07:21:45.235+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"your the current bidder.\n\n> For example, i may be gold 5, but currently my MMR is High silver 2, Low silver 1, and i am basically climbing from there again.\n\nand that is exactly the point, they just can't climb from the again because it takes at least a 67% winrate to go anywhere, because they would have to have at least 3 wins for every loss to climb 1 or 2 points.

Climbing takes a lot of time... but when I was gold 5 and just went on a massive loss streak I was also vsing a lot of silver III's and there abouts gaining half as much LP for a win than I was for a loss. I did feel like I was ment to be climbing but then I realise at that if you want to win 2:1 sort of ratio you need to be going 15-1 every game in reality. So climbing is potential but you need to raise your hidden elo first and that'll probably take another 200 ranked games or so to achieve at a 55% win ratio then you'll start to earn even LP for a win as you lose for a loss again.","replies":[]}]}
