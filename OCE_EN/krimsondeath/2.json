And all of which I had no idea until now, I feel like ive been playing ranked for nothing at all I dont even get played games because they reset at the end of the season, Why do you have to deny end of season rewards for people who dont leave ranked games very much at all! cant you do it for people who rarely leave? Or something to prove I played those games something for proof that I didnt waste 300 ranked games. No im not silver yet but I can see myself getting their before the end of the season since I have recently improved alot. But if you cannot do so do I get some sort of proof I played those games? can they be added to my normal games played at the end of the season? because I feel like their is no point continueing to prove that I can make it to silver because it will be wiped from existance at the end of the season. :( {{item:3113}}","replies":[{"poster":"Infected Walnut","date":"2015-08-24T13:33:42.472+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"lmao dw.\nno official announcement has been made.\nlytes response on his ask.fm wasn't the official statement on ranked rewards.","replies":[{"poster":"JasonWazza","date":"2015-08-24T13:53:18.651+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"http://ask.fm/RiotLyte/answer/131867181506","replies":[{"poster":"Infected Walnut","date":"2015-08-24T14:04:52.114+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=JasonWazza,realm=OCE,application-id=Ntey9fRZ,discussion-id=xGVsWXUf,comment-id=00000000,timestamp=2015-08-24T13:53:18.651+0000)\n>\n> http://ask.fm/RiotLyte/answer/131867181506\n\nhe said multiple 20 minute low priority ques.\nI don't think 2 of them is going to cause someone to lose ranked rewards.","replies":[{"poster":"Ediwir","date":"2015-08-24T22:17:41.258+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"We'll have to see for the details, but it's nothing new under the sun.\nFlamers don't get good stuff.","replies":[{"poster":"DragonOfTheVoid","date":"2015-08-25T17:04:51.967+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"they have already been punished y punished them again if there a good player now","replies":[{"poster":"Ediwir","date":"2015-08-25T23:01:18.365+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Mistakes have consequences.
