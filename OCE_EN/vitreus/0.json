Battle Academia has come and gone, alongside the possibility of Headmaster/Professor Zilean. Any plausible halloween-themed skin has also been bypassed. It can't be a Christmas skin as we've already got Old Saint. So what now?\r\n\r\nI considered that Riot will pull something clever out of their sleeve with the continuation of the Mafia skinline, perhaps. Godfather Zilean would be killer. \r\n\r\nAny other realistic ideas as to what might pop up in these final two months? As a Zilean main, this wait for a long-promised skin is gruelling to endure.","replies":[{"poster":"Big Brain Ahzoos","date":"2019-11-06T23:12:42.086+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"i don't think zilean will be getting a skin for awhile since he doesn't make riot money and isn't good for the current meta","replies":[]},{"poster":"Paperface","date":"2019-11-06T15:52:45.863+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hear me out, I can feel that it will be a legendary skin after all this waiting","replies":[]}]}
