So i tried to fix it in the client by repairing but halfway through it came up with &quot;unspecified error, see logs for information&quot; something along those lines. I&#039;ve uninstalled and reinstalled the game and it is still not working. I&#039;ve tried deleting certain things but its still not working either. This is what im seeing everytime I try to patch the client. It keeps showing my internet speed Mb(KBps) but doesnt actually tell me how long to go and how many files need to be scanned.\nhttp://imgur.com/a/j6Ylh","replies":[{"poster":"SephirothSG","date":"2016-08-14T10:05:48.589+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey there,\n\n* Could you please download and install the [HRT (Hextech Repair Tool)](https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/player-support/tools/Hextech%20Repair%20Tool.msi).\n* Select 'Gather System & LoL Logs'.\n* Locate the LoL Logs.zip generated to your desktop and upload to a host of your choice, reply back with a link to the file.","replies":[{"poster":"McLeGeNdArY","date":"2016-08-14T11:29:33.327+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"**Dxdiag**\n\thttp://www.megafileupload.com/bxhP/dxdiag.txt\n**Network info**\n\thttp://www.megafileupload.com/bxhQ/network_info_log.txt\n**Ping**\n\thttp://www.megafileupload.com/bxhR/ping.txt\n**Proc_List**\n\thttp://www.megafileupload.com/bxhS/proc_list.txt\n**Rads user kernel\n**\thttp://www.megafileupload.com/bxhT/rads_user_kernel.log\n**Task log**\n\thttp://www.megafileupload.com/bxhU/task_log.txt\n**LoL Patcher Logs**\n\thttp://www.megafileupload.com/bxhW/2016-08-14T10-44-42_LoLPatcher.log\n\n\thttp://www.megafileupload.com/bxhX/2016-08-14T15-36-11_LoLPatcher.log\n\n\thttp://www.megafileupload.com/bxhY/2016-08-14T15-44-45_LoLPatcher.log\n\n\thttp://www.megafileupload.com/7l90/2016-08-14T16-46-48_LoLPatcher.log\n\n\thttp://www.megafileupload.com/7l91/2016-08-14T16-56-58_LoLPatcher.log\n\n\thttp://www.megafileupload.com/7l92/2016-08-14T17-10-23_LoLPatcher.log\n\n\thttp://www.megafileupload.com/7l93/2016-08-14T17-23-20_LoLPatcher.log\n\n\thttp://www.megafileupload.com/7l94/2016-08-14T17-24-41_LoLPatcher.log\n\n\thttp://www.megafileupload.com/7l95/2016-08-14T20-21-30_LoLPatcher.log\n\n**Launcher Logs**\n\thttp://www.megafileupload.com/7l96/2016-08-14T10-43-55_launcher.log\n\n\thttp://www.megafileupload.com/7l97/2016-08-14T15-36-10_launcher.log\n\n        http://www.megafileupload.com/7l98/2016-08-14T15-44-45_launcher.log\n\thttp://www.megafileupload.com/7l99/2016-08-14T16-46-48_launcher.log\n\thttp://www.megafileupload.com/7l9a/2016-08-14T16-56-57_launcher.log\n        http://www.megafileupload.com/7l9b/2016-08-14T17-10-22_launcher.log\n \thttp://www.megafileupload.com/7l9c/2016-08-14T17-23-19_launcher.log\n        http://www.megafileupload.com/7l9d/2016-08-14T17-24-41_launcher.log","replies":[{"poster":"SephirothSG","date":"2016-08-15T01:51:44.088+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Could you please upload the .zip file generated by HRT, not just the contents of it as this makes it much harder for me to look through your logs.","replies":[{"poster":"McLeGeNdArY","date":"2016-08-15T02:13:23.105+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I dont know how to upload the .zip file onto a host.
