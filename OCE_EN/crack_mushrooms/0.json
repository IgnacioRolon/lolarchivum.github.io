I really like Ryze but he is literally the worst champion in the game right now. I feel like the nerf a while ago was super unfair as they removed 40% dmg from his Q! Which is his main source of damage. Please Riot buff ryze love playing him but hes utter garbage right now, thanks. \r\n\r\nAlso my suggestion would be to rework his ult, its just cancerous as it gets abused at high elo&#039;s and is fairly meaningless at lower elo&#039;s, thanks again.","replies":[{"poster":"jadelink","date":"2017-06-15T16:33:48.594+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"It's not the snare alone making him strong, it's the ulti, which is used by pro players on a coordinated team to do amazing things.

(Azir is the same, Azir masters are deadly as fuck, and bad Azir's are near worthless) It's all about skill. \n\nIf you know your champion inside and out, and practice, you'll perform just fine regardless of whatever your champion's win rate is.","replies":[]}]}
