The one I have been testing is oce.leagueoflegends.com. I don't think it's the exact server address, but it's the address of this website, and is close enough for me. Because I am getting terrible ping spikes with TPG, ever since Cyclone Marcia 3 or so weeks ago. I used to have 50 stable ping. Now, it's really bad, it will go from 60- 600+ very frequently, I cannot play any game properly. Even in a custom 'cs practice' game it will still spike to 300+","replies":[]},{"poster":"HORSE OF FORCE","date":"2015-03-20T06:47:28.687+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Might wanna remove your IP and user-name from that.
