I&#039;m not sure if it hasn&#039;t been implemented in yet but thought that I should just point it out. I also had one issue where I chose a champion with 5 second but it wouldn&#039;t choose and me and my friends had to wait because it counted as me dodging. I know it&#039;s still in alpha but thought I would just let you know.","replies":[{"poster":"SephirothSG","date":"2016-11-09T07:33:11.074+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey there,\n\nI'm unsure about the first issue, however the second problem sounds like a connection issue.\n\nAre you using a wired or wireless connection?","replies":[{"poster":"Dysphoria","date":"2016-11-09T12:44:51.237+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I have a WiFi range extender which is connected by ethernet cable into my pc.
