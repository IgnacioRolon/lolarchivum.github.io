Sejuani winds up a great ult as she q&#039;s into the Teemo and Trundle. Yasuo ults but has been feeding all game and has no damage. The Teemo manages to flash off to the side but at this point I reach the fight. I pick off Teemo, then make my way across the mid lane and tumble in to get the first auto attack off, melting him with the aid of Nasus e, I kill the Trundle. I then proceed to bait the Master Yi into the wall and ult tumble to get to the other side of him and getting the stun off. That&#039;s the triple. I then flash over the Lux e q combo and heal to gain move speed to catch the Jinx who dies to a tumble charged auto attack crit. By this time Lux&#039;s spell rotation has come full circle and she manages to land a bind onto Nasus and I while taking an auto attack that may have killed her if not for barrier, and at this point she flashes to further get behind the turret. At this point I am thinking it is out of reach, but hero Nasus flash whithers and I get in range to get the last auto attack securing the penta. Within 5 seconds of the announcer calling &quot;Penta Kill!&quot; everyone disconnects and I am happy yet sad that the game isn&#039;t recorded D&#039;:","replies":[{"poster":"fattyhotdogs","date":"2016-05-03T23:51:37.685+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Games in progress don't get kicked out when they bring the client down\n\nI think","replies":[{"poster":"Tweak","date":"2016-05-05T03:27:09.062+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Definitely was like that at one point.
