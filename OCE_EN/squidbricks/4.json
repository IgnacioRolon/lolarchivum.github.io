Honestly, I don't give a shit if your 50% win rate gold 1 account \"isn't your main\", or the fact that you are a paired with a gold 3 player while in plat 2 with a 52% win rate. If you can't play your role don't stay quiet until you inevitably start losing the game and then come out swinging when you go 4/8/2 and 4/8/3 respectively in a 20 minute game just to state that you \"hate gold players\". Cause THAT'S the reason you hard inted, good one buddy!","replies":[{"poster":"El Gringos","date":"2019-03-24T01:51:58.412+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"i played ranked for first time on a saturday night, i normally play mornings during the week, ive actually never seen such clowns, people were afk 2 out of 3 games, forcing a remake, then the game that there wasnt an afk it was just trolls","replies":[{"poster":"SquidbrickS","date":"2019-03-24T11:30:33.273+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=El Gringos,realm=OCE,application-id=Ntey9fRZ,discussion-id=AqbELAcq,comment-id=0000,timestamp=2019-03-24T01:51:58.412+0000)\n>\n> i played ranked for first time on a saturday night, i normally play mornings during the week, ive actually never seen such clowns, people were afk 2 out of 3 games, forcing a remake, then the game that there wasnt an afk it was just trolls\n\nYea I don't know, I might be slightly over exaggerating I guess but it definitely feels as though all the \"sickest lads\" are on at these times flexing their \"I'm better than a gold player, I don't care this is just my smurf account\" attitudes. I honestly prefer games where no one talks, and it's just pinging. But you get that one guy that's super optimistic in champion select which turns out to be the biggest %%%% in the game if things don't turn out alright.","replies":[{"poster":"Exarch Leona","date":"2019-03-24T12:47:59.081+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Fun fact:\nThe people saying this are usually people whos alts are in bronze/iron and gave up on them because messed up mmr so theyve bought a new account.","replies":[{"poster":"SquidbrickS","date":"2019-03-24T14:48:29.683+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"But why purchase an account, why not just make a new one?
