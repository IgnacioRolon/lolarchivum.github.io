No one on this server seems to be able to take general banter anymore. You can't even open up chat let alone all chat to type gj without being chastised for it. Literally getting the same dumb %%%%s every game with some sort of bullshit attitude that force you to either surrender, by means of afk, or play out a game that is just being dragged out. I have spent so long on this piece of shit game and dealt with the same %%%%s over and over, yet they still seem to be allowed to roam around intentionally losing games and because you speak up on it you get pinged with a warning from this bullshit reporting system and eventually get suspended. What a fucking joke. Apparently talking in all chat with someone from the other team warrants a suspension. Fuck off Riot, fuck this. Just going to load up a new account and fuck over every other %%%%s games like you allow so many others to do.","replies":[{"poster":"Streeserz","date":"2019-03-21T09:19:00.398+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The game's been in this state on oce for a while.... it's just that season 9 has amplified that problem because poor matchmaking has caused even more gaps in skill level amongst team members.\nIf you are not having fun anymore, it's sad, but probably a good decision to put the game down for a while.","replies":[{"poster":"SquidbrickS","date":"2019-03-24T14:55:37.289+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I honestly think the problem I have is that I really only get the enjoyment out of the game when I am playing with mates, usually, it's due to the banter on comms rather than actual gameplay and then I might squeeze in a few games of ranked later on in the evening. This is probably where the issue lies though, being the fact that late night ranked games seem to be riddled with people that aren't really there to play nice when it comes to having bad games.","replies":[]}]}]}
