Without saying anything, you sit there and wonder what reason could this person have for selecting this champion in this particular role. You eventually load into game, giving him the benefit of the doubt, only to realise that you are the solo on the team with a four man premade. You sit back in your chair and think of how this game could turn out, most of those possibilities point towards the Ezreal feeding immensely. To your suprise he doesn&#039;t do horrible, but he does nowhere near good. As the game pans out you rack up kills against the enemy Ziggs, you&#039;re now fed. As you don&#039;t have much of a team composition you rely on making picks, which you do multiple times on their Tristana. The time has come now, for you to group around top side in preparation for baron so you ping it a few times noticing that the enemy team are all missing. Your team is nowhere to be seen. Eventually they get there and the Poppy lands a great ultimate on the Amumu forcing him off baron and allowing for the Ezreal to gallantly Arcane Shift over the wall and smite baron, securing the buff for your team and getting you back in the lead. He fails his Arcane shift... Then flashes into the pit... And misses smite... So your Poppy and Ezreal are both dead, the enemy has baron, and you are already an inhibitor down. What do you suppose happens next? You get flamed by the four man of course, for being useless. Unsure why you deserve the tag &quot;useless&quot; you ask why they would say that. Then comes the endless accusations that you are the sole reason the team lost.
