From what I have seen so far, I would have been better off waiting until all the kids finished their placements. Because as it stands, I have had two players come into a game and say they got dropped a division and don&#039;t care about how they go over the course of the next few games. In a small way, it&#039;s a kind of, &quot;fuck you&quot; to those who are actually trying to get a decent placement. I understand that I sound salty, and by all means I am. But just a heads up for those of you who are thinking of getting ranked, just wait a week or two, it will do you wonders.","replies":[{"poster":"Z3npachi","date":"2016-01-21T03:47:10.852+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Pretty much. Then theres the players who avoided ranked over preseaon so their mmr wouldn't drop, completely out of practice. Playing arams for 2 months doesnt keep you up to par...\n\nI'll just keep spamming ranked, its a good laugh to say the least.","replies":[{"poster":"SquidbrickS","date":"2016-01-21T04:19:04.531+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Haha yea.
