This doesn&#039;t happen every game but when it does I am unable to join the game for around 10-15 mins at which point there isn&#039;t much point. I get to the loading screen and climb to around 90%, almost into the game, and then the bugsplat error occurs, not just once but multiple times. I have repaired the client countless times and it is still happening. Would just like to know if there is any permanent fix. Side note, this only started happening after I downloaded the latest patch.","replies":[{"poster":"HORSE OF FORCE","date":"2015-05-14T01:51:06.077+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Check out [this page](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201761974-Bug-Splat-and-Game-Crashes), because most of what I'm going to suggest is just rephrasing of what's on there.\n\nFirstly, make sure that you've updated your operating system and graphics drivers. Try to update your graphics drivers by directly visiting the manufacturer's website, not by using your operating system's updates to install them.\n\nThen try performing general maintenance on your computer. This includes scanning it with an anti-virus, defragging the hard-drive, cleaning the hard-drive of unnecessary files, physically cleaning dust out of the system, etc.\n\nIf that still hasn't worked, could you please run dxdiag (if on Windows) and provide a screenshot of the \"Display\" tab? Otherwise, anything that describes your graphics and operating system specs will be fine.","replies":[]}]}
