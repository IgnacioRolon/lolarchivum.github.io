This turns into a 25 minute onslaught of him abusing me calling me all sorts of crap like &quot;blind asian&quot; (I&#039;m not asian) &quot;stupid&quot; &quot;shit&quot; &quot;trash&quot; and well you get my point. So I respond to his accusations of me &quot;being the reason he died&quot; (when I wasn&#039;t in his lane) twice. Mind you I do deserve a report for calling him &quot;shit&quot; (full sentence in context was, &quot;It&#039;s not my fault you died, it&#039;s your fault cause your&#039;e shit&quot;). But as the game concludes and I go to report him for his antics he flames me yet again, which was never called for to begin with and I find out he is in a 3 man, so you can guess what happened next. 3 reports for &quot;verbal abuse&quot;. Now I&#039;m on a chat restriction and I bet he didn&#039;t even get a notice.","replies":[{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2016-04-24T15:41:07.102+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [3) We've upgraded the Report System to completely wipe out the power of Premade 4 reports ganging up on a player, and given the solo player \"equal power\" reports in this scenario.\n](https://ask.fm/RiotLyte/answers/133759089858)\n\nThough please note this really only applies to _**false**_ premade reports.\n\n> [Chat restrictions take multiple reports over a series of games into account. Players with normal behaviour will never be affected, and there are a number of protections in place that sort out false reports,_** premade abuse**_, and other potential issues.](http://boards.oce.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/announcements/L65wrRYe-player-behaviour-faq-updated-for-instant-feedback)\n\n\nAbusing false premade reporting will only lead to having their report accuracy/weight reduced. If you received a punishment for the game then it means the system deemed them valid reports. \n\nUnfortunately for you, retaliation is also not accepted behaviour. Defending yourself is perfectly fine (though not usually especially helpful) but responding with negativity in kind only sets you up for punishments as well. Your bet bet in this scenario is to mute or ignore, report at the end of game and move on.\n\nIf you demonstrate good behaviour for 3 months then your account will be back in good standing, so I'd be aiming for that. If you continue to demonstrate negative behaviour (remember that retaliation in kind is not accepted) then you will likely move up to a 25 game chat restriction, into a 14 day ban, into a perma ban. It takes three months for your account to drop each tier (e.g 14 day ban + 3 months of good behaviour means your next punishment would be a 14 day again instead of a perma).\n\nThis is your chance to take a look at your behaviour, and to look at how you are responding to people. If someone is being an ass to you is there really any point in responding to them? If you respond, in ANY way you add fuel to the fire. Ignore them completely and they have nothing, and will usually get bored and move on. \n\nThe kind of players that are really toxic are not the kind who's minds you can change, so it's not worth trying. Just enjoy the game as best you can, report and move on.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Devils Advocate","date":"2016-04-24T11:38:25.453+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"This is why i made the club i did, a week or so of it being up should provide enough members for people to have a good pool of people to play with without the toxic community on their team.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Roguestoney","date":"2016-04-24T11:34:45.673+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"RIP.","replies":[]}]}
