I go for lunch and come back about an hour later leaving my client logged on and join a ranked game. So the ranked game starts and I am porting, not seeing abilities and not seeing my auto attacks. My ping and fps are normal so I tell my team I have to restart client, which should only take about 2 minutes tops. But upon reopening the client, it proceeds to patch, for today&#039;s game mode, which I had already played earlier without it patching. So this takes up more time than expected and by the time I rejoin the game it is 15 minutes too late. Inevitably I get reported for &quot;afk/leaving game&quot; and now I have been placed into low priority. So am I right in thinking that because the client itself failed to work like it was supposed to, I am to be the one at fault, and therefore deserve to be punished for being afk for such a relatively long time ultimately causing the game to be lost?","replies":[]}
