They collectively went 0/13 during laning phase twitch going 0/7 and brand 0/6 but brand eventually joined up with the rest of the team that were doing well and finished 8/8/14, twitch afk splitpushed for most of the game until I told brand not to follow the twitch because he was dead weight and would just cost brand his life aswell. This is when twitch decided to call &quot;open mid&quot; and flame me in Korean along with the rest of the team and ran it down. He ended the game 0/11/2; the two assists being from splash damage from ult. My problem with this is that he didn&#039;t help the team whatsoever and tried his best to ruin our chances even though there was no chance we would lose, but I honestly almost wanted to just get the team to forfeit because no one deserves a win while acting like a complete dick.","replies":[{"poster":"Hideinplainsight","date":"2019-01-09T11:24:38.332+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Take it from me mate, just report the bloke if he's showing an attitude pertaining to being toxic or just trying to lose the game on purpose. There's a difference between someone trying and someone just blatantly doing the wrong things in an attempt to stir his team-mates. If it happens again, just mute and report. \n\nYou can't cure stupid I'm afraid. All you can do is not be afflicted by it.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Luxoar","date":"2019-01-05T08:17:30.400+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"If someone is like that in the game, it's probably best to not communicate with them because that will cause you to tilt as well.","replies":[]}]}
