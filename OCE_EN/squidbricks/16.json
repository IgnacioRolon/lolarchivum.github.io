Jhin and Zilean got first blood and then went about 20 straight deaths (combined) before getting another kill. Darius never warded and was always at Shen&#039;s turret. Skarner died multiple times to Kha&#039;zix either exposed in river or on less than half hp. When does feeding become intent feeding?","replies":[{"poster":"Professor Chaos","date":"2016-06-13T06:23:46.960+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"bad games happen. sometimes people make bad decisions while playing and they just get repeatedly punished for it. It's just the nature of the beast. Darius may have died 7 times but he had a decent amount of cs I wouldn't say its intent feeding.\n\nAll you can do is worry about your own gameplay and move on from games like this","replies":[{"poster":"tutfrr","date":"2016-06-13T10:05:53.035+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Agree!!! if they were intentional feeding. there would be like 20 death for everyone of them.  just dw and move on to the next.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"SquidbrickS","date":"2016-06-13T13:01:09.602+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yea I mean, I went on to win the next four games and played a further four after that only dropping one. So it didn't really drop my mood or anything. It's just difficult to play in these situations. I was trying to give pointers to help them make better decisions but you just get told to shut up and stop typing.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Bunny","date":"2016-06-13T04:52:11.109+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I don't know what it is but it just seems like there are more trolls playing this game. People are just playing poorly and blaming everyone else. You can't even be mad about it anymore because you're forced to play a team game which taxes you individually for how your team performs. Reflect if you're actually having fun and if you're not just go and play something else for a little while. Personally I've taken up FFXIV which is extremely calming in comparison to this shit fest.  But there is fun to be had in League you just have to be smart about where you put your time. I just had a game where I had a 0-9-1 Nasus you proceeded to shit talk and blame everyone else. He was the only one doing poorly but we lost the game because of open top after he AFK'd and he fed an Irelia .. so gg.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Cuddly Panda","date":"2016-06-13T04:35:37.589+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You just have to realise some people have bad games, or maybe aren't as good as the players they're facing so they end up losing lane and continue to feed (there's a problem people have with playing from behind too, and go too aggressive only to die over and over). Those people are just bad, lol, you can kind of tell if they're intentionally feeding though.. If they don't put in any effort in fighting before they die and just purposely walk up to them and do it, for instance.","replies":[]}]}
