However I noticed once I had managed to get to the 30 stacks required for transformation the devourer didn&#039;t transform like it was supposed to, ie. I had the cute little wolf with me the rest of the game (no real problems there). But I was just wondering if there was a known bug with Lulu and the sated devourer, note, I had built it using trailblazer and using the devourer enchantment so it could be through this as well. Just thought I&#039;d put it out there.","replies":[]}
