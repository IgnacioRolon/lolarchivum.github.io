Yes I might come across as a jackass complaining about the community, which lets face it, is trash to begin with. But I don't understand how there hasn't been some sort of tribunal system introduced into OCE to reduce the amount of \"troll\" accounts and to furthermore reduce OCE's overall toxicity. I have honestly played around 10+ games in the last week where I have had people go afk purely because some sulky mid doesn't ward, gets ganked then flames the jungler. There really needs to be something in place to counter this. It is abysmal to say the least. I get that Aussies are like the biggest cunts on the planet when it comes to talking shit but (no offence to NZ players for not referencing you, I'm just speaking what I know ","replies":[{"poster":"Ingénue","date":"2015-03-06T04:28:03.958+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"***Tribunal is the the works for all servers, because it didn't work before***.

From my thoughts about League is that we as players are competitive about winning and its the \"lets have fun with the game\" that has deteriorated. But! don't give up your hope on the game my friend, those 10 games and make the judgement that \"all\" Australians are toxic. There are friendly players out there and it is always nice meeting them. :)","replies":[{"poster":"SquidbrickS","date":"2015-03-07T02:39:39.098+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Interesting, I might have to go check it out to get some sort of idea in regards to the situation.

Australian people are generally trolls to being with irl worse in game. It doesn't help that we don't have the numbers the bigger severs have to make it viable for us to actually have a harsh tribunal system. But I suppose there always is the mute button and the incredible amount of spare time I currently have to make up for losing LP.","replies":[]}]}]}
