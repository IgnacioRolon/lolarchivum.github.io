I know others have also reported him over the few weeks gone as I have added a couple of them as friends as we played well in the game, heck he even we afk which he didn&#039;t feed  and we won the match 2 v 3, but alas still in game, still allowed to troll/feed and abuse people no matter how many people report. \r\nGetting tired of the toxicity in this game.","replies":[{"poster":"Tweak","date":"2016-04-14T00:35:15.255+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Sounds like you're playing Twisted Treeline. The amount of people playing that is much lower than Summoners Rift, so if you queue straight after a game you'll likely get put with the same guy every time.\n\nMy advice is, if you get a troll then wait 5 minutes after the game, then re-queue.","replies":[{"poster":"Damocracy","date":"2016-04-14T07:47:34.717+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yeah, doesn't stop them from being queued on other days but thats what I do now.
