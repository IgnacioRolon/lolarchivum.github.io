That is the entire point of the bronze ELO, for essentially new/bad players. The rating you are at is the rating you are at for a reason. Damocracy over here is well accustomed to the bronze ELO, being stuck at literally the lowest possible rung. Of course he is gonna get matched with bad team mates, he is at the lowest of the fucking low.\n\nAnyways mate the ranked system works with Tiers and Divisions, ranging from bronze (the low end) to Challenger (the high end). Each tier (bronze/silver/gold/platinum/diamond/masters/challenger) has 5 separate divisions, ranging from 1 to 5 (except masters and challenger, which only have one division). When you start ranked for the very first time you will play 10 placement games. How you perform in these games and how many you win will determine what ELO you get placed at, ranging from bronze V to Platinum V. The more advanced layer of this is called MMR, which is a hidden factor that chooses roughly what people you will be matched with and against. Your MMR is your match making ratio, and is affected by wins, losses and performance. Just try to play your best consistently as your MMR is a hidden statistic and is used purely for match making.\n\nDo I recommend playing ranked as soon as you hit 30? no, probably not, but once you hit level 30 and have enough champions, the decision is up to you. Personally I'd grind some IP to get at least 1 full rune page of tier 3 runes, preferably AD since every champ can utilise AD stats in some form or another.\n\nGood luck on the rift bud :) I remember when I hit 30 oh so very long ago, ranked at first can be a very daunting experience to the faint hearted. If I can give you one piece of advice my friend, and this is applicable to more than just League; You cannot correct or improve the gameplay of others. Only yourself. You play ranked to improve *your* gameplay, not your teammates or the enemy. The best way to improve is to look at your own gameplay alone. Yes, your teams actions will affect your likelihood of winning or losing by tremendous amounts, But your gameplay and mentality will affect it more than anything else can or could. Focus on improving yourself, and remember to have fun. at the end of the day, its all just a game :D","replies":[{"poster":"Plectrums","date":"2016-09-25T03:49:20.951+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=RNG Worlds S6,realm=OCE,application-id=T8eq2lFQ,discussion-id=BZf4Wl9s,comment-id=00080000,timestamp=2016-09-24T22:32:23.868+0000)\n>[snip]\n\nWell, thank you very much for the substantial and thoughtful reply :) Good to know there are some really decent people in this community, regardless of its reputation (and in truth my positive interactions so far have easily outweighed the negative).\n\nNow, I'm going to ask a question that may make me look like a douche, but is the skillcap in this game _really_ as high as people seem to think it is, and is the learning curve really that steep? Like I said, I'm level 16 (well, 17 now I think), and to me the game seems actually pretty straightforward. I'm totally willing to accept this is solely due to my ignorance, but that is how it seems to me at the moment. I've played a bit of support as Soraka, jungle as Amumu and a bit of general laning as Ashe/Varus, and I don't think I'm gonna get significantly better, mechanics-wise. Tactics-wise, sure, knowledge-wise, absolutely (just learning what all the opposition champions can do is quite a lot of raw data to retain), but I think I have a pretty good grasp of the fundamentals. Of course, I'm still amongst the worst players currently playing, but that's because in a game that's balanced in the way LoL is balanced I'm always going to lose to people that know more and have better coordination and faster hands (I'm 35 years old, ancient in gaming terms, I can't compete on that score). And that's fine, I can handle that. I'm not remotely daunted by the prospect of ranked play, I don't mind getting smashed over and over. Like you suggest, I'm just focused on playing to the best of my abilities and improving in whatever limited ways I can.\n\nI guess my point is that I find it baffling that most of the people who play this game seem to consider themselves and others as either awesomely skilled or utterly useless (of course, few people seem willing to place themselves in the latter category), when there's probably only a very small difference. It's just that a very small discrepancy in skill can mean the difference between ending a game with 30 kills or 30 deaths.\n\nHmm, sorry, I've gone into rant mode, I'll shut up now :P","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Erøse","date":"2016-09-24T13:05:38.472+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Who cares? it would be very less likely that you would play with them again.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Sasataf","date":"2016-09-24T07:04:21.091+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"An easy solution to this would be to put everyone in B5 when they start, instead of having them play 10 placement games.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Bookbash","date":"2016-09-23T21:04:23.631+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I forgot to mention, that yes its annoying to have to deal with a lot of noobies in your games, but if you are in bronze 5 there is a reason why you get paired with them.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Bookbash","date":"2016-09-23T21:02:39.666+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It's up to the player themselves to choose if they want to rank up.
