The guy who ends up in the support role, did not want that, he just didn't copy/pasta his preference quick enough. Then he gets paired with a douchebag ADC like you who does nothing but complain all game.\nYour language in these forums says it all, and I'll bet you're even worse in game.\nIf I got paired with you (if I played rift) and you behave like it seems you do every game, I'd just go support another lane and let you get fucked.\nI'm thinking you're getting what you deserve.\n\nNo wonder no one likes to support in these low level games.","replies":[{"poster":"Damocracy","date":"2016-09-05T04:35:15.176+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'm quite pleasant in games.

Water of a ducks back. Why because that's what I do to others as well. If they can man up and see their mistakes hopefully they won't do it again. If no one ever points out mistakes how can you learn from them.\nBut yeah na, if they can't play a fucking role then watch a video, look up a guide and go play bots or customes and fucking learn.\nI can play every role and I expect everyone else to as well. No excuses. \nIf an old guy like me who suffers pain all the time can do it so can everyone else no excuses.","replies":[{"poster":"WeaponizedAutizm","date":"2016-09-05T10:20:35.655+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Whats you summoner name?

It's basically like a test and tune day for racing, stuff around with different things and try new shit out, have a bit of fun while you're at it.\n\nI never flame or judge anyone in norms because I know that's exactly what it's for. So everyone just gotta deal with it.\nI purposefully haven't given ranked a go much this season because I know I'm not ready for it, and I have a lot to learn still.\n\nI'm all for trying to make this game a balanced set, champ/item nerfs/buffs etc...\n\nBut if you don't like all the toddlers playing and pissing in the toddlers pool, don't get in the toddlers pool in the first place.

Also, I do not expect you to win your lane because you have a gankplank support, that champion can't peel or help you sustain in any way, only poking which clearly doesn't work because sona has heal and can give high amount of sustain to ezreal. I understand that you are frustrated but trust me bro when you realize your mistakes and you start improving on it, you would be climbing. Was placed at Bronze 3 and was ALWAYS calling out bad players and heck I didn't climb. Started analyzing my mistakes carefully and boom I made it to silver 3 promos and I went on a losing streak which put me back at silver 4. I just have to hustle back to silver 3.
