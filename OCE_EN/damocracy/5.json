I finished the game but because a few people reported me for afk even though I got more cs, more kills than a few on my team.\nI explained to them that my nbn went down and I connected to my mobile but my team harrased me, started saying I was downloading porn and to fix my net.\nThe stupid thing is trolls and feeders don&#039;t get reported by this community but I have my first semi afk in over 3 years, due to no fault of my own, I get leaver buster. \nYour system blows.","replies":[{"poster":"Ingénue","date":"2016-05-24T03:16:32.440+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Like _Heartvine_ stated, it is unlikely that you were punished after just one leave (especially if you have been playing for 3 years).

It does however kick in after 5mins of afk because even the shortest period of DC can make or break a game and is enough to negatively impact on the other 9 players.\n\n I myself received a leaver buster warning for [this game](http://matchhistory.oce.leagueoflegends.com/en/#match-details/OC1/129912848/200910244?tab=overview), where my client bugsplat in the last 7minutes. It also counted as a loss, and I lost my promos. While it was frustrating af, I totally understood because my absence for those last 7 minutes could have thrown the game into the other teams favour. \n\nAlso, I just want to clear one thing up:\n>if enough people report you you get leaver buster\n\nLeaver buster system is completely automated and reports aren't factored into LB punishments. \n\nIn saying this, the other report categories are extremely useful in catching out trolls and toxic players, so please continue to utilize them if you feel a player needs to be punished! \nIf you have been punished by instant feedback report system (not leaverbuster) and feel the report was made in error, you can appeal your case through [**player support**](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/requests/new).","replies":[]},{"poster":"Omni Presents","date":"2016-05-24T08:01:55.354+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I would say it's because of the butthurt assholes we all have to play with.
