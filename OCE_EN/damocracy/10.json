Cait and Jax went back to base even though mid was pushed while our kat split pushed bot. After base Jax went jungle while cait went to take our red even though theirs was free to to take. \r\nJax and Cait were on full health as Tryn tanked baron.\r\nThis lost us the game as both tryn and I were gunned down trying to get top while the other three just wasted baron buff.\r\nI hate bronze plays sometimes.","replies":[]}
