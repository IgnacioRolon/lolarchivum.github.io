I think playing fill should earn you some points when it comes to the madness that is champ select!\n2) I am strictly against insta-locking champs. I believe in calling your roll before selecting champ.\n3) If someone joins after I've called my role I will always type it again so that they have vision of what roles have been called.\n\nIt should be the other way around, block people from insta-locking !!! not for calling a roll ?!!","replies":[]},{"poster":"Alamo","date":"2015-07-30T01:57:09.954+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Dat moment when u call before u join, banned from chat ...","replies":[]},{"poster":"Lord Sesshomaru","date":"2015-07-29T19:33:06.220+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"This is the most frustrating thing!","replies":[]},{"poster":"TeCoolMage","date":"2015-07-29T11:27:42.545+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Sometimes it doesn't get blocked for me, but instead follows through my speed typing in slow motion, while I sit staring, wanting to get the message through already before someone else steals my role (and they usually do. And there's nothing I can do to stop it at that point so that person ends up raging even if I say it 0.25 seconds late, and the usual thing to assume is that I posted before seeing them call, thinking I'm a troll who'll go to that lane anyway regardless of how much I say I'm taking another role instead)","replies":[]},{"poster":"LUPIN lll","date":"2015-07-29T04:11:34.863+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Oh you missed your lane call?
