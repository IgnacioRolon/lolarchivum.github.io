I could not kill him. I could not kite him and it took three of us too kill him.\nHow is this even balance Rito?\nHow much more magic pen do I need to actually make a difference when facing a tank?\nDoes Rito think that the current state of this horrible mata is good where a non damage champ who is so far behind can still take down a carry with ease and walk away with more than half health?\n\nMaybe with more armor/magic resist item, the less damage your abilities do forcing tanks to actually build damage. Think of it as negative returns.\nOr maybe buff the penetration items to actually make tanks think about their build instead of cookie cutter build = broken OP tank","replies":[{"poster":"Tweak","date":"2016-04-21T04:22:18.783+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"In an idea 'world' tanks would soak damage, deal small amounts and have a way to force enemies to target them. This is how it was with rammus and shen back in the day.\nHowever, the game needed to create original ideas for tanks and keep it fresh. Tahm is an example of a fresh idea. \n\nThese pure tanks aren't causing too much trouble to me. It's the damn akali tanks and ekko tanks.\n\nTahm can be kited by dodging his q.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Devils Advocate","date":"2016-04-20T01:35:08.924+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"no need to add, comments already covered it.

Taking 50 mr off someone who has 100+ mr does way less than taking 50 mr off someone with only the base 50  or so. If you want to damage tanks, buy a void staff (this alone will give you more penetration than all 3 of the flat pen items put together later in the game vs tanks). You also complain about not being able to kite him, but for some reason you didnt buy a rylais, which is one of the best items on brand and allows you to kite immobile melees like tahm basically indefinitely.\nTLDR; Your build is the main reason you felt so useless. If you had built differently, a champ like tahm would not be an issue at all (aside from maybe saving teammates from you burst)","replies":[]},{"poster":"OCE Yisus","date":"2016-04-19T12:42:27.302+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"There is nothing wrong with that, AP burst champs aren't meant to deal with tanks, you are legit useless the moment you finish your damage\n\nIt would be a different story if the fed person was a Nocturne, Yi, skilled ADC or just a consistent damage champion overall","replies":[]}]}
