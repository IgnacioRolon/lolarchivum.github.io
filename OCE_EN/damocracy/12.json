Your point is thus void.\n2 - Your analogy is void because you’re also assuming the supervisor doesn’t do anything if people don’t say so. Riot does have systems implemented which detects trolls and they do do stuff about it. Thus your point is also void.\n3 - You left the game which is 100% against Riot’s Summoner Code. Them trolling or not is more or less dependent on the ‘victim’ as identifying it as a troll move or not, but you leaving is absolutely universal of breaking the Summoner’s Code.\n4 - You don’t care if you get banned? Well you’re one step closer to it.\n5 - Yes I’m using lists because by this post I’m assuming you’re some childish twelvie. But see how this is also an assumption? This may not be correct at all, but if you point out that I just made an assumption which is untrue, then you would also then contradict the point of this post. Thus now I challenge you. Either point out that I just made a void assumption but also make your own point void, or withstand the tremendous amount of hate you’re about to get from the rest of the community.\n\nYour move OP.","replies":[{"poster":"Damocracy","date":"2016-08-22T20:28:14.803+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Ah the old resorting calling me a twelvie, nice one.

Unfortunately, it's always the negative cases that stand out! That being said, if players are repeatedly trolling in game, the automatic feeder detection should have picked them up and they will face punishments. Your reports will also help refine the system and help it to better detect feeders.\n\nWhen you say you submit tickets, are you doing this through the support site, or in the post-game lobby? Reporting after a game ends is the best way to deal with this as the instant feedback system can then work to deliver a punishment to the offender's account within 15 minutes.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Chalze","date":"2016-08-23T09:01:42.785+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Lol OP u just proved my point then","replies":[]},{"poster":"Miicka","date":"2016-08-20T01:27:41.721+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Well in my opinion it depend on what your view of 'trolls' is. \n\nIf they were just playing something out of meta like teemo jg in normals, they didn't really do anything wrong.

But even then, they technically haven't done anything wrong, but it still pisses me off.\n\nBUT, if they played something out of meta and intentionally fed, or just did things that were completely stupid which lost you the game, THAT goes against rule 4 of the Summoners Code (which states that you can't purposefully sabotage a teammates game or something I think).\n\nAnd yeah if they just stole lane, instalocked or were being toxic, that's obviously wrong and the only thing you can do is report them and move on.","replies":[{"poster":"Damocracy","date":"2016-08-22T20:20:30.550+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Double jg instalocker.
