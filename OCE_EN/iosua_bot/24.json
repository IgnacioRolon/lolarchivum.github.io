Because {{champion:131}}  has some good sustained damage and {{champion:89}}  has like... negative damage.\n\nFirst off, the thing that most people forget: {{champion:89}}  has fucktons of armour AND a huge magical shield, {{champion:131}}  has light armour and no shield. \nThis puts {{champion:89}}  at an advantage straight off the bat, It's like a fencer up against a Knight in shining armour. \nIf we examine their powers, {{champion:89}}'s power supposedly comes from the Sun, {{champion:131}}'s power supposedly comes from the moon, and like VENI VIDI VICI pointed out, the light of the moon is only light reflected from the sun. Not to mention the surface area of the moon is significantly smaller than the surface area of the sun. However it is unlikely that the two champions can draw upon ALL the energy of their respective celestial bodies, so lets assume they can draw the same amount of power from each body. If the two champions can draw the same amount of power from each body, and the two powers met full force (like a DragonBall Z beam fight) its likely that {{champion:89}}  would win due to the sun outshining the moon (if you got sunlight and moonlight and shone them on the same spot the golden sunlight colour would wash away the whiter tones of the moonlight) \nSo considering {{champion:89}}  has more armour, pretty much the same weapon (a single handed sword), a giant magical shield AND her power source is stronger. It'd be my guess that She would win. Yes its true, {{champion:89}}  probably wouldn't want to kill {{champion:131}} , but you don't need to kill someone to beat them. \n\nPlus {{champion:136}} would probably Vote for {{champion:89}} (if he was forced to choose) because she is using the power of a Star and not the power of a floating piece of rock, and he does so love stars, plus he has seen and knows pretty much everything, so I trust his vote.","replies":[]},{"poster":"DarkShade918","date":"2016-06-23T02:08:54.250+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Lorewise - di she already cut down hundreds of solari, leo would just be one more\nGamewise - leo she's a tank, like what would a di do 100 points then get destroyed by leo's constant cc\n\nTEAM DI ALL THE WAY","replies":[]},{"poster":"VENI VIDI VICI","date":"2016-06-22T11:18:35.826+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Leona..
