Negative attitude in any game (even if it doesn't result in any punishment) will prevent you from earning any honour for that game. Positive players obviously earn honour faster than neutral players.\n\nThe average player seems to be earning a checkpoint every 3 weeks - 1 month, but that may differ below level 2. I know they recently made the recovery to level 2 easier since the curve was a bit steep, but I don't know how it compares to checkpoints above 2.","replies":[{"poster":"Iosua Bot","date":"2018-08-23T11:46:24.087+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Fair point, but then like prior to my ban I got 2 - 3 non premade honours a game (I'm not even joking here), but something tells me that still won't be enough (for obvious reasons).\n\nI think that the honour system is a bit busted.\n\nLike if you think to last season, anyone could get to honour 5 like that *snaps fingers*.\nNow in this season you have to get at least 3 - 4 honours a game to make honour level 5 (my own opinion).\n\nI know I'm kinda ranting right now (and probs being a b*tch too) but they kinda need to fix this system and how everyone gets to the honour level that they deserve (unlike me to be honest - I most likely deserve to be under honour level 2 for this season xd)","replies":[{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2018-08-23T12:42:39.980+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Last season we only had a fraction of the year to earn honour, so it was accelerated. This season we've had all year, and it's meant to be a long term accomplishment. Honour is designed to be a reward for consistent behaviour over a significant period of time, which is why it takes so long to level up, but also why checkpoints were added to still give a way to measure progression.\n\nPersonally I don't get 3-4 honours a game (more like 1.5) nor do I play anywhere near as much as I used to with the recent exception of Nexus Blitz and I'm on the cusp of level 5, so you hardly need 3-4 honours a game.\n\nI'm not sure what exactly you're suggesting they adjust so I can't really comment on that.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"DarkShade918","date":"2018-08-23T09:49:30.334+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Have been below honour 2 since March, i only just got back to honour 1.3. \n\nSo if you let that sink in:\n\n* i play roughly 3-10 matches a day (sometimes more)\n* i'm rarely if ever toxic nowadays\n* Its now August/September, so 5-6 Months and im not even honour 2 yet, if you're intention is to get back to high honour, GOOD LUCK WITH THAT, you're screwed until at least next year\n\nEdit: I receive anywhere between 1-3 non-premade honours per game, and 1-2 premade honours when i play with my mates, so given that i've had such a long time below the honor line, based on all these digits, i reckon its about 2-5k honours to get from honour 0-2","replies":[{"poster":"TF Blade","date":"2018-09-05T02:52:39.930+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"idk if im just lucky but it took me 7-8 months to go from honor 0 to honor 2 checkpoint 3...
