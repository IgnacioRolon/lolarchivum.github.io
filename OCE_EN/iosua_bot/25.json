Hell I would of gladly pre-ordered it. But I didn't know about it back then. But the fact of the matter is. You didn't pay for it. So why should anyone else who wants to play pay for it? Generally when games get as many players as lol they generally make the game cheaper or even free not the other way around. It simply doesn't make any sense from a business point of view either. It would most likely drop their revenue. Because I for one would probably not of spent upwards of $4000 on this game had it not been free.","replies":[{"poster":"Iosua Bot","date":"2015-09-02T03:56:36.013+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"I see your point, I also would've pre-ordered this game if I knew about it <3\nAlso, I would've gladly paid 4 this game, being that it is worth the money that i've paid (Over $300 spend on RP).\nWhat I'm trying to say is that this game should not be free because it would suppress the amount of smurfs that are made per-day.\nThe game (HONEST TO GOD) that we all play should be at least $5 (USD Currency).\nI mean like, what did you think I was gonna price this at? $20?","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"GigaPube","date":"2015-09-02T06:52:43.058+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"feeding the trololo folks...","replies":[]},{"poster":"Buffpeanut","date":"2015-09-02T01:19:05.595+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"im guessing that you dont know that they make a huge amount of money\n\nif it aint broke...","replies":[]},{"poster":"DragonOfTheVoid","date":"2015-09-02T00:40:56.451+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"why would you pay for  it\nand if they did then we would all go to dota or heroes of the storms im not gona pay for a game if there are free ones just like it","replies":[]}]}
