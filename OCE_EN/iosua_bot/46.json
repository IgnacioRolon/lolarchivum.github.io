I checked out the Labelling of the game in the FAQ page, and in Australia it says &#039;M&#039; Rating, that being said does that only mean high schools that educate students over the age of 15 are allowed to sign up on this?\r\n2. I know there are a lot of students that play this, so that also being said, is this why you are targeting this area for this &#039;Club&#039; idea? Or just an _expandment_ (not real word) of the &#039;University Club&#039; idea?\r\n3. (Last question). Is there a limit on the Club members? Or is that decided on the school expectations?","replies":[{"poster":"Maraudaur","date":"2016-04-26T08:27:12.126+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey Zen Bot,\n\nI'm always glad to see another fellow board member looking to get involved. Let me try answer your questions;\n\n1. **I checked out the Labelling of the game in the FAQ page, and in Australia it says 'M' Rating, that being said does that only mean high schools that educate students over the age of 15 are allowed to sign up on this?**\nWe are giving this visibility to schools, because it means most likely if they do choose to host a LoL club (which we hope they do!). They will most likely need to ask for parental consent. \n\n2. **I know there are a lot of students that play this, so that also being said, is this why you are targeting this area for this 'Club' idea? Or just an expandment (not real word) of the 'University Club' idea?**\nThere are many reasons we have decided to do this, one reason is because high schools like Unis is already a place where naturally our players are getting together in the same physical location. But more than that; we believe together we can change the perceptions of what gaming means to teachers and parents. League of Legends is more than a game to us, it’s a passion, a lifestyle and where we met our friends. It’s filled with big wins, tough losses and epic comebacks. Together we can highlight some similarities to traditional sports, this may be a great way to talk to parents and teachers about League of Legends. Teamwork, leadership, communication and discipline are required in sports and League of Legends, and that could be key in sharing why League isn’t a whole lot different than other students playing rugby. We want to make it easier for teachers and parents to see this in our game. This is why we are asking teachers and students to join us in creating a great experience for League of Legends players in high school.\n\n3. **(Last question). Is there a limit on the Club members? Or is that decided on the school expectations?**\nHow a club is run is entirely up to the school. We are here to offer any support and information that they may need to move forward with this. \n\nHope that answers your questions!","replies":[{"poster":"wallah fight me","date":"2016-04-28T09:10:24.611+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"i feel like primary schools are getting left out lol, like my little brother","replies":[{"poster":"Jonius7","date":"2016-04-28T20:49:44.187+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"LoL isn't really for primary school children.","replies":[{"poster":"wallah fight me","date":"2016-04-28T21:33:53.549+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Jonius7,realm=OCE,application-id=NjEElsTI,discussion-id=Ip9LeXiE,comment-id=000000010000,timestamp=2016-04-28T20:49:44.187+0000)\n>\n> LoL isn&#x27;t really for primary school children.\n\nyeh haha","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Iosua Bot","date":"2016-04-26T22:12:12.551+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Wow.

But first we need to develop more high school club infrastructure and school relationships. Once the scene is a bit more developed then we can start looking at hosting tournaments.

They know who those players are pretty well, if they don't know them, someone they do does. \n\nWhat about the rest of the players that aren't students but would like something like this.\n\nI feel Riot based this decision on easy to manipulate players for a quick success story with its idea. For me, I'm going to have to keep my club post bumped up to stay relevant to people looking for a club. And that's only if they are aware and active on league boards which again, limits my ability to reach the community.","replies":[{"poster":"Maraudaur","date":"2016-04-26T22:01:37.470+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey dude, \n\nI explained why we are also doing high school now in answer the OP's question 2.\n\nIf you're looking for help running a club I'm here to help!

(Myself, i'll be bluntly open, im on a cocktail of medications to keep my sanity in check, however as the day progresses the later it gets, the more volatile my state of mind can be, i may be keen to enter  game, its happened a few times, then as the load in screen kicks in i suddenly feel neuseous and sick and i don't have the fortitude to last the load in, explain, only to be flamed for it. It's why i get frustrated at the leavebuster system and not being able to request its removal at times... Sometimes i just close the screen and vomit my guts up and pass out in the bathroom for 20mins, feel ok an hour later. Come back to rejoin and play again, only to have 5 20min waits etc) \n\nIt may be, we'll run inclub competitions as time goes on, come up with RP / Cash prizes for club members who in, allow them to set the club message to a link to a video/music clip gloating of their victory (in good humor of course). A place for people of all caliburs to improve, be it in normals, ranked, arams, scenario maps etc. Ideally its a way for people to casually play competitively without the ranked system or toxic team mates, can have banter knowing it isn't toxic flaming, but in good taste and jokes. (maybe not all the jokes arent in good taste, but not to be taken seriously.... older guys can come up with some outright filthy witty remarks, but we don't want to expose our experienced vulgar mouths to teenagers etc).\n\nThat we offer understanding, that life can happen. Sometimes you may quit, but your not going to be reported. We'll  chat when you get back and make sure things are A-okay on your end and you're good.\n\nJust a mature place thats non-toxic, people will talk, get to know eachother, have a laugh, open up a voip and have a beer or something and a laugh, talk about life not just league etc.","replies":[{"poster":"Maraudaur","date":"2016-04-27T02:57:23.738+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Ahh I see, yeah the 25&up club right?\n\nI'm happy to offer some assistance.

Your club seems to be growing well, make sure to get your club members to invite their friends (as long as they meet the criteria of course). An invitation from a friend or someone you know is much more likely to be responded to than a message out to the masses.\n\nWhen it comes to running events and competitions remember to check out our events portal for tournament prizing - \nhttp://boards.oce.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/community-events/bWtno6fE-tournament-prizing-how-does-it-work\n\nhttp://boards.oce.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/community-events/5VfpQ1pe-guide-how-to-organise-your-first-online-or-live-tournament\n\nAnd if you're hosting other types of competitions or events make sure to get in touch with me and I can help you out with some prizing for that as well.\n\nYou can get in touch with me here on the boards, in client or on [social media](https://www.facebook.com/Maraudaur)","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Lord Sesshomaru","date":"2016-04-26T09:51:30.579+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Marauder seems to have answered this very well, but i thought id add a fun fact, it says in the 'terms of use' that we agree to when we play the game, that you are forbidden from identifying yourself to riot if you are under the age of 13.\n\nIt doesn't answer your questions but its interesting food for thought.","replies":[]}]}
