Firstly the new HUD makes you have to press 'C' to see your stats - the most stupid part of the HUD, secondly your consumables are now nearly pitch black when you are dead making it difficult to buy items because you can't see your consumables in your inventory, lastly when you are out of mana the ability is no longer light blue; it is darkened. This is why I find new HUD shit idc if u disagree. \n\nP.S. Riot give us the option of HUD..","replies":[{"poster":"Talon12","date":"2015-07-23T12:51:19.800+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"you can press the little helmet to keep stats up constant","replies":[]},{"poster":"Bookbash","date":"2015-07-24T05:03:58.695+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Aragorn,realm=OCE,application-id=Ntey9fRZ,discussion-id=EQOb7ZGI,comment-id=0002,timestamp=2015-07-23T08:47:28.160+0000)\n>\n> secondly your consumables are now nearly pitch black when you are dead making it difficult to buy items because you can't >see your consumables in your inventory, lastly when you are out of mana the ability is no longer light blue; it is darkened.\n\nThis is mainly why I dislike the new HUD also.
