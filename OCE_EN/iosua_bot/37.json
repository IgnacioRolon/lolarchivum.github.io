The fact he went out and forged his own team and they have made it all the way to the semis is awesome.\n\nI'm a bit of a sucker for the EU LCS in general, so I really hope they can somehow pull this out.

Only one of the enemy team reported  him or said he/she did. He didn't get enough reports but surely deserves a ban for a few days at the least!! {{summoner:11}} http://tinypic.com/view.php?pic=2cs9s8k&s=8#.Vile2m4aCM9","replies":[{"poster":"Pikachoochoo","date":"2015-10-22T22:20:22.161+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I tried reporting another troll but it got taken down for name and shame????
