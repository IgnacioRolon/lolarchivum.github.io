In what universe does going 5-5 as a silver elo plyer, put you at the lowest of the low in the solo que ladder. Like there is probrably like a dice roll system that randomely picks what rank you get regardless of your skill or \"elo\"","replies":[]},{"poster":"BarryButcher","date":"2016-01-21T10:18:14.404+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Becuase a new unranked account is rated roughly Silver 3-4'ish. So the very first time you play ranked its easier to get higher.\n\nAfter the first time, your rank from the previous season has a great impact on where you place.
