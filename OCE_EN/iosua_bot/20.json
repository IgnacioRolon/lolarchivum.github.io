Meanwhile you have Miss Fortune plotting Gangplanks death. \r\n\r\nAct 3:\r\nIt&#039;s kinda obvious of what&#039;s gonna happen, cause everyone knew Gangplank was gonna die and Miss Fortune was gonna succeed in her plot, especially if you took into account that:\r\n\r\n1) You&#039;ve read Act 2\r\n2) You went onto Surrenderat20.net to check out any new skins coming out and saw Captain Fortune\r\n\r\nContinuing on, you have Twisted Fate and Graves set out their differences and come together once more and in the end:\r\n\r\n1) Miss Fortune wants everything / everyone dead / destroyed if they&#039;re associated with Gangplank, &#039;_I want the head of every lieutenant_&#039;\r\n2) Twisted Fate and Graves go to Piltover to get a new gun for Graves\r\n3) And lastly, Gangplanks crew, ship, associates were either: Killed, destroyed and forgotten.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion to my longest discussion EVER, (and most likely my last), I would like to say, thanks Riot (mainly the authors whom made the Acts) for putting a Back Bone into this huge event.","replies":[{"poster":"Jaredan","date":"2015-08-01T00:44:49.171+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Thanks Zen Bot.

I enjoyed the Freljord and Shurima narratives but Bilgewater  for me has been the best in terms or the story telling and the game modes around it. Having to choose which path to follow was difficult but that helped to add weight to the story further. \n\nThanks to all the staff involved, I look forward to seeing which area will be the next focus. Maybe will will be finding out who really killed Yasuo's master in Ionia?","replies":[{"poster":"Jaredan","date":"2015-08-01T00:46:20.565+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Cheers!
