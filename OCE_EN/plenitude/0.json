My internet is running fine, yet this randomly happens. I stopped playing yesterday after the first time it happened, and decided to try again today in which I managed to play 2-3 games without any problem, but it has just started up again.\r\n\r\nRelaunching the client doesn&#039;t seem to do anything for it, and trying to reconnect to the server keeps me on black screen.\r\n\r\nWhat&#039;s going on? And furthermore, how can I stop it?","replies":[{"poster":"darkxaiver","date":"2015-10-24T05:45:12.387+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"I am having this same problem. can't even play a single game though.","replies":[{"poster":"Plenitude","date":"2015-10-24T05:46:48.264+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Have you managed to get into matches, or does it crash right out during the match load in?","replies":[{"poster":"Hobojackal","date":"2015-10-24T05:48:14.652+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Can't even start a game now.
