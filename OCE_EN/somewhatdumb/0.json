To be clear, if you used any program on the account for any reason that gives an unfair advantage and/or interferes with the gameplay loop from pressing play to the end of the game, then you are responsible for this punishment, and it will not be revoked.\n\nIf you used a program that was previously allowed, but with a recent update has changed that, then you *may* have an ignorance claim, depending on what it was, what proof you have of features used and such. This is something you will have to take up with Support and is entirely up to their discretion. Ultimately any third party program falls under a 'use at your own risk' policy.\n\nIf you have shared your account with a friend or family member who used illicit programs on the account then, unfortunately, you are also responsible for that behaviour, and the punishment will not be revoked. Account sharing is also against the ToS, and while it isn't actively actioned unless it is being used maliciously or unfairly (boosting, that type of thing), sharing an account loses you quite a few of the protections that a fully secure account has. Again, it is a 'do so at your own risk' type deal.\n\nIf your account was compromised, and someone broke into your account and proceeded to use illicit programs on your account, then barring any extenuating circumstances, you have a case for recovery. If this is the case, then given that you did not give access to your account away, and the programs were not used by you, often player support can restore the account once it is secure. This involves among other things, changing your passwords and going through the account recovery (ownership verification) process.\n\nUltimately, the final decision is up to Player Support.","replies":[]}]}
