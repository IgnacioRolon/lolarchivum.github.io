But while we were away my friend was hacked, he had his Silver V promos thrown, and was sent back to Bronze I.\r\n\r\nSince then my friend sent a ticket or two and emailed Riot about this, just to make sure he was doing all he could to make sure he wasn&#039;t hacked again, This was riots response:\r\n\r\n&gt; Actions that have been performed on your account are in violation of the League of Legends Terms of Use. You can review these terms at http://www.leagueoflegends.com/legal/termsofuse\r\n&gt; \r\n&gt; Due to the severity of this violation, your League of Legends account has been banned until Mon Feb 22 22:22:22 UTC 2100 \r\n&gt; \r\n&gt; If you have any questions, contact our Player Support team at - \r\n\r\netc etc we all know the drill.\r\n\r\nIts not just that my friend was banned for pointing out how his account was used for Toxic behavior, its that he has EVIDENCE that someone else has been in control of his account;\r\nAn account by the name of **Horsels** was added and talked to through my friends account, and the conversations they have talk about how he is going to throw my friends games, how they laugh about how my friend was in Promo&#039;s and how they just lost them, things that the real owner of the account would never say. He has screenshots (which I will not produce here as he had already sent them to Riot via Ticket/E-mail)\r\n\r\nMy friend was trying to do the right thing by letting Riot know what had happened with his account and how it was used, If he hadnt spoken up about it what are the chances Riot wouldve taken notice of something like this? something that happens every day in ranked games across the globe? \r\nIf you commit a crime you don&#039;t hand yourself in knowing you&#039;d receive the death penalty, I just fail to see the logic by Riot in this circumstance.\r\n\r\nYes, I understand that due to Terms &amp; Services his account must be punished. In an online world its the account you use not the person using it, But I want to know that my friend won&#039;t lose his account that he has poured his heart, soul, and not to forget Wallet into, due to a Security Breach. \r\n\r\nThe hacker did lose his games and we have no way as players to find how he was acting in chat but from Match History Alone we can tell: He didnt pull a Tyler1, He didnt AFK until 20, He didnt pick &#039;On-Hit Annie Jungle&#039;, He Played The Game, intentionally Badly for the Most Part, but he got kills, assists, he played Meta Champions and did Meta Builds, he just threw intentionally by the end.\r\n\r\nI want answers for my friends future, but I won&#039;t accept that answer to be a Permanent Ban,\r\n\r\nP.S I won&#039;t supply the Images stated as my friend has already sent tickets explaining every single detail so there&#039;s not point in me beating that dead horse just to treat skepticism.","replies":[{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2017-04-08T08:25:22.892+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Was he banned before or after he informed support of the compromise? If it was before then he would have gotten that message for the actions taken while the account was compromised, but after contacting support the account would remain banned (security ban) until he proved ownership of the account and changed his passwords.\n\nSupport has changed their policy recently and if an account is compromised they will usually unban it if the ban was a result of the compromise (please be aware they still have no obligation too, since as you say, technically the responsibility lies with the account, rather than the player), your friend simply has to go through the proper means.\n\nOnce support knows there was compromise involved they will move his ticket to account recovery and ask him a whole bunch of questions to prove ownership. Once he has given them enough info to prove he is the original owner of the account, he will get it back. They can't restore his rank of course, but he won't lose the account.\n\nI'd also recommend telling him to change his password to something longer and something unique. Most compromises outside of scams happen because a League password is shared with an email password or something similar. Tell him to check his email too and probably change the password for that, since often the linked email account is compromised as well.","replies":[{"poster":"BandleGunner","date":"2017-04-08T10:52:44.012+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"He was banned AFTER informing about the compromise. \n\nAs soon as he realized he was hacked he changed his password and then proceeded to send a ticket/e-mail Riot about it.\n\nAn hour later he was Permanently Suspended.","replies":[{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2017-04-08T16:24:35.948+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Sounds like a security ban to me anyway.
