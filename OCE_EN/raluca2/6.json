I was wondering if their was a way to limit the LP loss to the connected players whilst deducting LP from the dc&#039;ed players.","replies":[{"poster":"Istehz","date":"2015-07-02T07:02:32.671+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Riot could possibly make something like this\n\nIf one  person was disconnected from the game for longer than 10 minutes you would lose 15lp instead of 20\nIf 2 people you would lose 10lp instead 15lp\n\nThis would  possibly cause people to just leave if they were losing hard and let the enemy team end the game so they don't lose so much lp.\n\nRiot could then make it the person that is disconnected only loses 18lp instead of 20 \n\nIt's an idea but Riot could be working on something right now.","replies":[]}]}
