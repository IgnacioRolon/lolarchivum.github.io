The ruins of the world.\r\nThe rasping, heavy breath of an old man crawling along a shadowy path, his old, crooked staff barely supporting his weight. Life had never been more cruel to Ling, not since the fall of Icathia. He had seen much in his life, but he had no strength for another fight. His arms were cut and bruised, his back lacerated and aching with pain. He would die here sooner or later.\r\nBut that was not the time to give up.\r\n\r\n_Bandits_\r\n\r\nLing was in no mood for this. He did not wish to fight, let alone in this condition. He could hear the heavy steps of the men stalking him through the forest, he could **feel** their gaze on him, their greedy little eyes hovering over his satchel, estimating if it was worth to kill him or not. Ling knew he had only a few more minutes before the band of criminals descend upon him. As if continuing a casual conversation, Ling turned around to where the men where hiding. _Is there anything I can do for you gents?_ Ling spoke as courtly as possible. The largest of the men, obviously the leader, stepped out into the open, his golden teeth glinting in the moonlight. He made a gesture towards Ling&#039;s satchel, and drew a serrated blade from behind his back. _Oh, that?_ Ling responded, _I would love to share, but this is not for you._ The man sneered back and lunged at Ling, but was repelled by an invisible force, as if the air itself moved to block his way. The bandit champion spat in the ground at Ling&#039;s feet, but when he looked up, he was facing two men. _What took you so long, my dear Shen?_ The man called Shen simply dismissed it with a deft wave. \r\n\r\nThe other bandits were wary now. They came to ambush a vulnerable old man, but they did not expect anyone to come and save him. The men circled Ling and Shen like a pack of hungry wolves, anticipating their meal. Shen drew his Demon blade, its edge shimmering with the fire in his soul. He dashed forward, a blur of blades with demonic might and inhuman agility. Every strike filled the atmosphere with crimson rain, until the moon itself turned a scarlet red. \r\n\r\n_The hunt was on._\r\n\r\nThe bandits fled for their lives, cursing under terrified breaths. Nothing had prepared them for that - after all, they were simple bandits, not specially trained warriors raised specifically to fight the unnatural. They didn&#039;t stop running until their lungs were robbed of air, their legs heavy with fatigue. Looking up at the sky, they could almost see the sunrise over the horizon and hope returned to their hearts. Perfect balance - justice had been done, yet the criminals live on. nothing was changed, nothing was killed. Everything would live in harmony. The thought warmed their hearts as they drifted off to sleep.\r\n\r\nThe rising sun cast its light over the bodies of the bandits, their peaceful expressions perfectly still, though their corpses were riddled with holes. In the midst of them all, a single flower reached out with its petals to embrace the new dawn. Ling smiled, his crooked staff echoing on the empty pebble path. Did the bandits know who they had met last night? He touched his satchel, the metal inside clinking gently. Ling took one last look at the bandits, and with a single flourish, he disappeared into the ruins, the echo of his staff dying down to nothing more than a whisper.\r\nHow tragic. How dramatic. How ... **Beautiful**\r\n\r\n_The red moon burns\r\nA demon stirs\r\nThe lotus blooms\r\nAhead lies your doom_\r\n\r\nSorry if this seemed really short and rushed, this is my first time writing fanfiction :P (but hey why not give it a go) and I really hope you enjoyed!\r\nAlso there is a reason why the main character is called Ling, for those that are wondering.","replies":[]}
