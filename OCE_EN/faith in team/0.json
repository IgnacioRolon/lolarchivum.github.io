(link attached)\nIn addition to that, Nocturne fits perfectly into the role of _&quot;All Darkin must have unique weapons&quot;_, As there is no other champion with such blades\nLastly, Darkin have been known to corrupt and invade other&#039;s minds. And if you read the description for Nocturne&#039;s E, it states that he **&quot;plants a nightmare in his victim&#039;s mind&quot;**, So i thought that maybe the same technique could be used to possess mortals. Now this got me thinking - During the music video, Varus **SHOT** a spectral arrow into Kai (or Vel i can&#039;t tell whos who), and that arrow was the key to binding Varus to the two hunters in the video.\n**SO IS NOCTURNE A DARKIN?
