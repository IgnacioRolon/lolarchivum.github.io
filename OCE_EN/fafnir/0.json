I believe in the past there was such an event but the only thing that has changed was the landscape, other than the rift covered in snow there was not much. Not to mention we got a new map, having a new baron/dragon would definitely spice up our Christmas, don&#039;t you think?\n\nMy idea for baron is, that santa has an alter ego, normally he stands there with his bag, kinda like gragas but when a player attacks it, it changes form, same concept for dragon.","replies":[{"poster":"Samurai Jin","date":"2015-10-13T08:27:54.420+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"A Christmas SR would be help get people into the Christmas spirit, I can also imagine that it would slightly reduce the overall toxicity in solo queue...","replies":[{"poster":"ƒamous","date":"2015-10-14T05:01:51.078+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Just because it's a Christmas map doesn't mean it will change toxicity.\nlmao","replies":[{"poster":"Samurai Jin","date":"2015-10-14T05:24:24.350+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I never specifically said that a Christmas map would change toxicity, but rather it would get people into the Christmas spirit quicker, hence slightly reduce the overall toxicity in solo queue...","replies":[{"poster":"ƒamous","date":"2015-10-15T05:50:52.525+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Regardless of a map or spirit, that spirit will quickly subside.
