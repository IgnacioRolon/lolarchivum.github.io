I am looking to find a Ranked duo partner who could possibly help me get out of bronze, I don&#039;t mind their rank.\r\nWouldn&#039;t mind being in the same league as me as long as you can be the same/higher skill level as i am! Thanks :)","replies":[{"poster":"heartbr0ken","date":"2015-08-23T08:57:56.635+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I have nothing against you asking for a duo partner, but consider this:\n\nThe system probably placed you in bronze because that's the rank you deserve (no offense). If you try and use someone with a high skill level than you to climb to a higher rank, you may as well drop back to bronze after a few games.\n\nOnce again, I don't have anything against your decision, but this is just my 2 cents. It may as well be worth nothing to you.","replies":[{"poster":"RebirthKnight","date":"2015-08-29T17:34:01.876+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"That said though, the bronzies can be the worst teammates. My provisional were shit because each game someone went AFK or intentionally fed. Having a partner is not bad, but to rely on them is a different story. We deserve good teamwork and good people with better attitudes than the salty and toxic people that we normally get.","replies":[]},{"poster":"iBlitzcrank","date":"2015-08-23T11:14:44.002+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I understand completely, Thanks for getting back to me! :)","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Feir","date":"2015-08-23T11:00:47.112+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"hay mate i added you \ni wont carry you but i will teach you to play better if that is what you are looking for","replies":[]}]}
