Any questions/tips etc leave a comment below or add me in game IGN- Yasho ( just a note, somethings have been tweaked and changed and there is also a couple new ideas) And remember to leave feedback!\n\nFor my idea, I&#039;ve come up with a skill set that could work well in the jg and possibly top lane. This champion is a Tank/Assassin, He fits in with the assassin play style of sneaking up behind people and completely destroying them or just going face first, but to balance that out he&#039;s damage is reduced. Having tank scaling this assassin now becomes a great front line force to be reckoned with. He has a slim character design wearing a long black cloak and a black shady looking hat with some thing to cover-up a bit of his face. He wields a pistol and a sword/dagger\n\nPassive - &#039;Champion&#039; gains an empowered attack every 4 auto attacks, he shoots his pistol at an extended range, dealing normal damage (no bonus damage) and stripping 5%/10%/15% of the targets armour for 2 seconds (Lvl 1-6 5%/lvl 6-12 10%/lvl 12-18 15%)\n\nQ Ability - &#039;Champion&#039; Throws his blade, if a target is hit it will deal 65-180 damage (Bonus damage scaling with AD)(goes through minions but will mark upon large jungle creeps) slowing them by 25%/30%/35%/40%/50% leaving him unable to auto attack(unless he uses his passive), but this will leave a mark on the target. If activated in the next 5 seconds &#039;Champion&#039; will appear on the opposite side of where the blade connected to the target and he will fire his pistol into them dealing an extra 40/75/115/150/185 damage (Bonus damage scaling with AD) and slowing them again for 15%/20%/25%/30%/40%\n\nW Ability Passive - &#039;Champion&#039; has mana/hate. Hate is built up with items that boost &#039;Champions&#039; health but in return halving his mana(If player obtains muramana they will have 500 extra mana instead of 1000). Hate gives bonus 5%/10%/15% lifesteal(In combat) and 5%/10%/20%/25%/30% movement speed(out of combat). Champion receives 10 hate upon killing minor units and 20 upon killing large units, 30 for champion kills/assists, 5 for attacking enemy champions in combat and 2 every second.\n\nNew Active Idea - Champion channels partial amounts of hate into his gun (25-50-75-100-125 for each level) granting him bonus damage for the amount of hate applied. The bullet fired will travel a short distance and deal 25% less damage to non-champion targets (large jungle creeps are excluded from this e.g. The big Krug, Red buff, Blue buff, Baron) to all it hits and stops at the first champion hit. The bullet will deal 60/80/100/130/160 damage(damage scaling minimally with AD) and strip 5%/10%/10%/15%/20% of the targets armour. But the bullet fragments will over penetrate also dealing minimal ( no more then 150 damage at max level and will not scale) damage and slowing by 25%/30%/35%/40%/50%\n\nNew E Ability Idea - Champion channels 10% of his current hate into his blade, thrusting himself upward into the air and coming down upon a set location. All enemies he lands on directly will receive 80/100/140/160/200 damage (Bonus damage scaling with HP) and will also additionally be stunned for 1.25/1.75/2/2.25/2.5 seconds and enemies he does not directly land on will be shoved back a small distance and receive a slight slow.(also during the thrust he can interact with his q and w)(Kills and assists reset CD)\n\n Q/E Combo - Player uses Q to apply the slow and uses E. Whilst in the air player re-activates Q to land right behind the enemy and applying a stun and finishing the Q animation.\n\n(For the combos, there will of course be combos for all the ideas, but for now i have just come up for combos with the new E and the old Q. Q will most likely stay the same)\n\nNew R ability Idea - Passive - Champion receives an amplified attack which deals 25% extra damage to non-champion targets and in return get 5% max of his hp back every 50-40-30 seconds. If used on enemy champions the attack will not deal extra damage but will return 5%/10% of your current hp and the cool down of the passive is reduced by 30%\n\nActive - Champion makes a blood sacrifice to the Sun god above Sacrificing 10%/15%/20% of his current hp and his remaining hate. Thus in return granting him 25/50/75 extra attack damage(bonus damage scaling with HP) and 5%/10%/15% lifesteal and AoE amplifications on 6 auto attacks. If, the champion just so happens to die during the ultimate (The ultimate will last a total of 15 seconds, if he uses the auto attacks he will not have the buffs but the ultimate will still be around to activate the last part of it), the champion will explode into a fiery ball of hate. This will apply an instant 50/75/100 damage and burn damage dealing 10/20/30 damage for 5 seconds and slowing all ( enemies and allies by) 40%/45%/50%\n\nJust a couple things to mention. All his abilities apart from R will require mana. His Q will use just mana, his W &amp; E will use hate and mana but mana cost will be lower and his R will take HP and all hate. And for his HP and Hate, he would generally get to around 3000-4000 hp. So hate will be capped at 500, so basically for every 100 hp is 10 hate and every 1000 is 100 hate but you start with 100 and by the end of the game can reach 500. Also he will have black cleaver disabled.\n\nBasic Lore\nWhen he was a little child he's parents were murdered by criminals from Zaun and Piltover, he never saw them again and could barely remember their faces. He was taken in by a master assassin from Shurima that lived in Demacia. He was raised by this assassin, took on his beliefs and his way. Once he came of age his master gave him an ancient Demacian gun that was passed down to him by his mentor and was trained on how to use guns. Afterwards he was trained to use blades. \nHe took his training and joined the Demacian military. He helped them accomplish a lot and grew a very famous reputation throughout the ranks. But unfortunately, his mentor was killed by Noxians when he refused to accept a mission to infiltrate Demacian bases and steal information while he was fighting a war. The Demacians heard that his mentor was communicating with Noxians and knew of his ways. So they went on a manhunt for his student. Little did they know it was the one who bought them many victories.\n\nOnce found, he was outlawed after he was suspected of committing high treason against the king, but due to his outstanding military record they spared him. He travelled to Ionia and got a house, started a family and joined the Ionian Military during the war. He was a commander during this war, he lead hundreds of men from Ionia but he did not realise that during a battle that his men hated him so much that they betrayed him by stabbing him in the back a few times, once the news broke out the commander was dead, even though he wasn&#039;t, the Ionians fled. He woke up in a Noxian cell and there was a man in front of him trying to talk to him, but he was still dazed from the attack and unable to speak.\n\n2 weeks passed he was still being held in the prison, left wondering where his battalion was, when they would rescue him. But he overheard the guards talking about that battle and what happened to him. He decided he wanted blood. He waited for the guards to open the cage and attacked. He took their swords and killed them all. He gathered his gear and ran for Ionia. He was outlawed in Demacia, and now his new people hated him. He was filled with hate, vengeance and the thirst for blood.\n\nHe made it to Ionia, Slaughtered the men who betrayed him, and went home.....\n\nBut he did not know what to expect. He&#039;s home had been destroyed. Noxians had attacked it and destroyed it. They killed his wife and they hung his son. He had nothing nowhere. The only place where he might may not even exist. Shurima.\n\nHe was now filled with complete hate, he had nothing left, nothing to return to, so he decided, that  through the guidance of the sun god, he will make his way to Shurima in search of a new home, a home which may not even exist. And on the way, he will carry out assassinations, robberies and he would do this, with, or without pay as he would do anything just to see the faces of those who pushed him away die.\n\nCan&#039;t think of a name for this guy\n\nI have yet to update the lore, bare with me, I&#039;m just adding some final touches to it.\n\nOnce again, If you got to the end thank you, um yea this is basically what i had in mind, let me know what you all think of the new ability ideas and which ones you like more, the old or the new and just to refresh your memory I&#039;m thinking this champion to be like jungle or top lane.","replies":[{"poster":"Chalze","date":"2016-09-07T06:47:23.261+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey uhh Yasho, I'd personally cut out the 'old' ideas since it makes this wall of text really uninviting to read\n\nI've gone over the Q ability but as soon as I ventured into the W, E and R, everything just became far too convoluted.\nHere's my feedback for what I was able to read:\n\nSo his passive seems like Jhin’s passive mixed with Poppy’s passive, which I somewhat feel may be a tad overpowered at top lane since top laners are generally melee. I’d say perhaps every 4th attack or maybe even every 5th, 4th, 3rd for Levels 1-6, 6-12 and 12-18 respectively, scaling up along with the armor reduction.\n\nHis Q seems a bit weird on paper, so he throws a projectile, if it hits someone then it marks them but renders you unable to autoattack, and if you activate the second portion of Q, you will basically blink on the other side of your marked target at the same distance from where you activated it relative to the target? Isn’t that easily countered in lane if the enemy just turret hugs or stays close to the turret since if you do reactivate your Q you’ll end up blinking into turret range? Also, because of that, if you wanna avoid that from happening after firing the projectile, do you have to wait the entire 5 seconds out before you can start to CS again or attack?","replies":[{"poster":"Yasho The ADC","date":"2016-09-07T07:36:10.569+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The original idea was for a jungle champion that may be able to be played in the top lane (Examples of that would be, Lee Sin, Shyvana, Wukong, Zac and Rammus). So yes what you say is true where his Q is easily countered by turret hugging but that is more from a lane perspective. But even if you don't reactivate your Q you can still auto attack with the passive, as he is able to fire with his gun and you can also interact with his W. I also forgot to mention a change when i re-posted the idea. If the person you have hit moves out of a certain range you can't blink to them which will also return your blade. Thus allowing you to CS normally. I haven't worked out ranges just yet, but the ranges won't be large and even for the passive. It will be a ranged attack yes but it shoot at a short distance. Also just to clear somethings up the reason being he can't auto attack normally unless he has his passive, is because the projectile thrown is his sword. There may also be like some kind of indicator to show you as well which side you will blink to before you re-activate the Q.\n\nFor the Passive I have changed it to every four auto attacks. The passive is a work in progress trying to figure out more ways to tweak it as at the moment it seems a bit strong. Thinking weather to remove the bonus damage or the armour strip. \n\nIf you need me to try to explain the skills a little bit better just let me know and i will do my best.\n\nThanks for feedback. :)","replies":[]}]}]}
