So this is the first Chapter of his lore that I&#039;ve called: \nLove Gives Nothing But Pain, But Pain Gives Purpose, okay this is Chapter 1.\n\nFor I am one who belongs to no civilisation, no family, no faith, and yet you are the one who kneels before me like I am some kind of god.(A quote he will say)\n\nThe words of a sad king, a mad man, the words of the Expatriate of Civilisation himself, the man known as Dvorac, once stood before the greatest king known to our people, and watched him beg for mercy. But Dvorac was not born the way he is now, and I shall tell you how it all began.\n\nIt was a cold, fierce and lonely night in Demacia, wind blew through houses and destroyed them from the inside. Looters and gangs roamed the streets using the cover of the night sky and the bad weather to hold up poor civilians trying to get to cover. The legend has it, that Dvorac used to be called Declan, and that Declan and his parents were wondering the streets trying to seek refuge in neighbouring homes, but nobody would open up to them. \n\nHis father owed 900 gold pieces to a fierce gang that ruled parts of the underground of Demacia, the people within the gang we&rsquo;re both at war with each other, one half being an old gang from Zaun and another from Piltover, they combined forces and now they set their eyes on Declan and his family. \n\nDeclan&rsquo;s father led them into an alley where there was minimal cover, at least enough to keep them out of the rain, but that was possibly the worst decision he ever made. They were followed by the gang into the alley way and the only way out was through the gang. \n\nGang Leader &ndash; &ldquo;Well, well, well, look at what we found rotting away in an alley way! Ha-ha (rest of the gang cheers and celebrates)&rdquo; \n\nChristopher (Declan&rsquo;s father) &ndash; Get out of here please, we don&rsquo;t want any trouble we just want to get through the night unharmed!&rdquo;\n\nGang Leader - &ldquo;Well you should have thought of that before you borrowed from us shouldn&rsquo;t have you?? Where&rsquo;s the money Chris, you know what will happen if you don&rsquo;t come up with something right?&rdquo;\n\nChristopher &ndash; &ldquo;I TOLD YOU LAST NIGHT I DON&rsquo;T HAVE THE MONEY, BUSINESS HAS BEEN BAD THE LAST 2 WEEKS!&rdquo;\n\nGang Leader &ndash; &ldquo;WELL! CHRIS!!, you don&rsquo;t have to yell at me but I guess that just means you won&rsquo;t live to see another day!&rdquo;\n\nThe Gang Leader drew his sword and charged towards Chris, drove his sword through Chris stomach and pinned him up against the wall. He turned his eyes towards Declan&rsquo;s mother and grabbed her by the hair, and lifted her off the floor and stabbed her several times. He then set he&rsquo;s eyes on Declan. He grabbed Declan by the collar and lifted him up, but just as he lifted the knife into the air, he froze, in absolute shock. \nDeclan watched the blood drip from the blade that just took the lives of his parents, he watched the soulless eyes of the Gang leader staring right into Declan&rsquo;s eyes in absolute shock and fear. The gang leader then dropped him and collapsed. The rest of the gang panicked and rushed for the kid but a shadowy figure appeared before them all, lifted what appeared to be a gun and fired it. There was nothing else to see but a giant red flash in the night sky.\n\n2 days had passed and Declan woke up in a warm, cosy bed. He stood up in shock and screamed, not knowing where he was he panicked, confused about what happened in the previous nights before. Then a tall man dressed in a ceremonial Shuriman robe came into the room and attempted to calm him down. \n\nHours passed and Declan was told about everything. \n\nDeclan &ndash; &ldquo;So you saved me, and now you want to train me?&rdquo;\nShuriman man &ndash; &ldquo;Yes, I&rsquo;m the leader of an assassin group that has been around for years, we have connections to ancient and royal bloodlines and carry out jobs for anyone that provides payment.&rdquo; \nDeclan &ndash; &ldquo;May I ask your name then if it&rsquo;s not too much to ask&rdquo;\nHun &ndash; &ldquo;People call me Hun, you may also. If you continue to train for me I promise you vengeance against the people of Zaun &amp; Piltover, well at least those within that gang.&rdquo;\nDeclan &ndash; &ldquo;I will train with you but, I&rsquo;m only 9 years old, I&rsquo;m too weak to do anything and I don&rsquo;t think I could kill anyone yet.&rdquo;\nHun &ndash; &ldquo;Not a problem Declan, I was 7 when I started my training. If your hatred for these people is strong enough, you will not fear sending them to their deaths.&rdquo;\nDeclan &ndash; &ldquo;Okay, when do we start?&rdquo;\nHun &ndash; &ldquo;Today&rdquo;\n\nThey trained and trained for almost 2 years, yet to fulfil Declan&rsquo;s wish of vengeance but the night of such was near and in celebration Hun summoned Declan to his quarters.\n\nHun &ndash; &ldquo;Declan! I wish to congratulate you on your successful training and outstanding performance with ancient way of the blade and gun. Please accept this as a token of appreciation; it was handed down to my mentor by his mentor and now to me. It once belonged to an ancient king of Demacia, and it was passed down through the family line, until a king was killed in battle and he gave the gun to his best friend, and now, it belongs to you. \nHun passed him the ancient Demacian gun with great care, pride and honour. Declan was in absolute awe when he laid his eyes upon it.\nDeclan- &ldquo;This is the, it can&rsquo;t be, this gun is the King&rsquo;s Whisper?!?&rdquo;\nHun &ndash; &ldquo;That is correct&rdquo;\nDeclan looked up and smiled at Hun and thanked him, but Hun did not have the same happy look on his face, but a look of fear and worry, like something bad was about to happen. \n\nA couple weeks ago &ndash; Hun was hired by the Noxian military to infiltrate a Demacian camp and steal military information and give it to the Noxian command, but the price was too low and the risk too high. Hun gracefully refused, but the Noxians now wanted him dead, so they put a price on his head.\n\nBack to current time &ndash; Hun and Declan set up a trap at a bar the gang were supposed to go to, but they never showed and Hun knew something wasn&rsquo;t right. He scouted the area whilst Declan stood guard watching the bar and waiting for the gang to appear. \nHun saw what was wrong but it was not what he expected, there were about 50 Noxians in the middle of town skirmishing their way toward the bar. He had to hold them off so Declan would be safe and he did so. He fired his gun into the air, creating a giant white light to blind all that could see. He used this to his advantage and drew first blood. One by one he massacred the Noxians and when he thought all was done and no one was left, A giant axe came flying towards him. \n\nDeclan still waiting at the bar for the gang to appear, but no one had come. They must have gone somewhere else. He&rsquo;s thirst for blood was unquenched and he was left dissatisfied, but he could not sit there and whimper in silence. He left to search for Master Hun. He roamed the streets of Demacia but could not find him. For hours, he searched and he searched but there was no sign of Hun. But there was a small group of the gang he was supposed to ambush tonight, so he forgot about Hun for now and set his eyes onto the gang members. He stood still and pulled out his gun. He sat silent and waited for the best moment to shoot. *Bang* He fired his gun and took out 2 members with one bullet, he then channelled hatred into his gun and picked up his sword and bolted down to them. The battle was intense but it was one that was easily won. He weaved and dodged bullets and blades and fired his own pure hatred into the hearts of the gang members he was slaughtering. It was 9 on 1, and Declan came out on top. \n\nMidnight hit and Hun was nowhere to be found but then Declan heard screams coming from the heart of Demacia. He rushed to the heart and found a woman pointing toward the top of a tall building. Declan glared upwards in absolute shock and horror when he seen the decapitated body of his master hanging from the top of a building.\nWhen he got the top he saw that through Hun&rsquo;s back was his sword with a note on it. He took out the sword and cut Hun lose and read the note, it said:\n&ldquo;Oh dear whoever the hell reads this, I had a direct order from the Noxian General himself Darius. This was nothing personal but it had to be done, Love&hellip;. Noxus&rdquo;.\nDeclan&rsquo;s heart was filled with nothing but rage and utter hatred towards the people who done this. He wanted them all dead, he wanted the people of Noxus to be exterminated like the rats they were. \nThe night passed, Declan buried Hun, and continued to live the way he was taught and continued his training. He took on everything that Hun believed in and his way of life. He abandoned the name Declan as it carried too much a burden on his life and adopted a new name. Dvorac. He then went and joined the Demacian military.\n\nThat is it, that's chapter 1 hope you all enjoyed let me know what you all think so far, i might put up the rest when it's done if you guys enjoyed.","replies":[]}
