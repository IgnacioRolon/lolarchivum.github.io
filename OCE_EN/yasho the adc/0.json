{"poster":"Yasho The ADC","date":"2016-09-15T10:49:24.675+0000","title":"The Expatriate of Civilisation - Updated Concept - @Maraudaur","subforum":"Player Creations","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hello, recently I have posted up my ideas for a champion. I&rsquo;ve yet to figure out a name but I have figured out a title. I&rsquo;m making another post this is the 3RD update for this champion idea. Somethings are staying original such as the Q and the passive. They may have minor/major tweaks and the W E will keep a similar concept as what they are now but will keep changing until I come up with something good. Having trouble figuring out ranges but I can at least say that even if somethings sound like they are long ranged they actually aren&rsquo;t that large. E.g. the passive will be ranged but won&rsquo;t have too much range. He will also have fairly long cooldowns. \n\nFor my idea, I&#039;ve come up with a skill set that could work well in the jungle and possibly top lane. This champion is kind of a Tank/Assassin, He fits in with the assassin play style of sneaking up behind people and completely destroying them or just going face first, but to balance that out he&#039;s damage is reduced. Having tank scaling (not heavy scaling) this assassin now becomes a great front line force to be reckoned with. He has a slim but bulky character design wearing a long metal/black (kind of like a tungsten carbide material) cloak/cape and a black shady looking hat with something to cover-up a bit of his face. He has light armour to give him a bit more of bulky look also but also maintaining his mobile design. He wields a gun and a sword \n\nNew Passive &ndash; Every 5-8 auto attacks &lsquo;Champion&rsquo; will fire his gun dealing standard damage but applying a small burn dealing 20/40/60 damage per second for 3 seconds. Additionally, &lsquo;Champion&rsquo; will shroud himself with his cloak granting him 30/40/50 extra armour and 10/20/30 extra magic resist for 3/4/5 seconds.\n\nQ Ability - &#039;Champion&#039; Throws his blade, if a target is hit it will deal 65-180 damage (Bonus damage scaling with AD) (goes through minions but will mark upon large jungle creeps) slowing them by 25%/30%/35%/40%/50% leaving him unable to auto attack (unless he uses his passive), but this will leave a mark on the target. If activated in the next 5 seconds &#039;Champion&#039; will appear on the opposite side of where the blade connected to the target and he will fire his pistol into them dealing an extra 40/75/115/150/185 damage (Bonus damage scaling with AD) and slowing them again for 15%/20%/25%/30%/40% ( Also if marked target goes outside of a set range before the 5 seconds ends, the player will be able to auto attack again)\n\nW Ability Passive - &#039;Champion&#039; has mana/hate. Hate is built up with items that boost &#039;Champions&#039; health but in return halving his mana (If player obtains muramana they will have 500 extra mana instead of 1000). Hate gives bonus 5%/10%/15% lifesteal (In combat) and 5%/10%/20%/25%/30% movement speed (out of combat). Champion receives 10 hate upon killing minor units and 20 upon killing large units, 30 for champion kills/assists, 5 for attacking enemy champions in combat and 2 every second.\n\nNew Active Idea &ndash; &lsquo;Champion&rsquo; channels 10% of his current hate into his gun and swiftly fires it, leaving his opponent confused (feared stunned or slowed, some kind of cc) and dealing 70/90/110/130/150 damage (Bonus damage scaling with enemy max HP) additionally it will leave enemies around the target hit, slowed by 25/30/35/40/45% (This is a skill shot that will go through minions and stop at the first target hit)\n\nNew E Ability Idea - Champion channels 10% of his current hate into his blade, thrusting himself upward into the air and coming down upon a set location. All enemies he lands on directly will receive 80/100/140/160/200 damage (Bonus damage scaling with HP) and will also additionally be stunned for 1.25/1.75/2/2.25/2.5 seconds and enemies he does not directly land on will be shoved back a small distance and receive a slight slow. (also during the thrust he can interact with his q and w) (Kills and assists reset CD)\n\nQ/E Combo - Player uses Q to apply the slow and uses E. Whilst in the air player re-activates Q to land right behind the enemy and applying a stun and finishing the Q animation.\nW/E combo &ndash; Player uses E and then quickly uses W whilst in the air. All effects from the W will take affect if it hits an enemy champion but the E will not stun \nand only slow by 25/30/35/40/45% and deal 25% less damage.\n\n\nNew R ability &ndash; Must have a target marked with Q. Champion blinks behind the marked target, removing the blade from their body dealing 100/110/120 damage(scales off of their max HP) and slowing them for 10/20/30% and quickly uses the last of his hate to shatter the ground beneath him with his sword causing the earth to shatter and rumble dealing 90/135/170 damage(bonus damage scaling with your max HP) to those in the crumbling ground and applying a stun (to those close to him) for 2 seconds and slowing (those near the end of the range/half way) by 20/30/40%.\n\nJust a couple things to mention. All his abilities apart from R will require mana. His Q will use just mana, his W &amp; E will use hate and mana but mana cost will be lower and his R will take all remaining hate. And for his HP and Hate, he would generally get to around 3000-4000 hp. So hate will be capped at 500, so basically for every 100 HP is 10 hate and every 1000 is 100 hate but you start with 100 and by the end of the game can reach 500. Hate is tied in with his lore. To keep killing people he hates he must stay healthy (HP) if he stays healthy, his hatred grows and can keep killing people he hates thus meaning he needs to keep staying healthy (getting more HP)\n\n\nBasic Lore was removed because it made the concept look huge and unappealing to read. If you want to read the lore I&rsquo;ll somehow edit/comment it in or something like that. I&#039;m also adding some final touches to it so if i do post it, it may not be the greatest yet.\n\nEdit - Came up with a name and the name i chose is Dvorac(means castle in another language) let me know what you think of that name.\n\nCan&#039;t think of a name for this guy any tips/suggestions for a name would be greatly appreciated. This is basically what i have so far have been working to improve the idea for a long time now. Any feedback (advice/tips/suggestions) please leave a comment below.\n\nHave a great day,\n\n-Yasho {{champion:240}} \n\n\n\n\n\n\nLinks to older/original ideas\nhttp://boards.oce.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/player-creations/h41fNuz6-updated-champion-concept-the-expatriate-of-civilisation\n\nhttp://boards.oce.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/player-creations/AcToj676-everyone-champion-concept-the-exile-of-civilisation\n\n1st chapter of the lore - http://boards.oce.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/player-creations/eXrH1Y6K-expatriate-of-civilisation-dvorack-lore","replies":[{"poster":"Fitzky","date":"2016-09-16T01:42:33.285+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"When you posted your champion concept 3 times and it got 0 attention despite having full visual description, abilities and a name {{sticker:zombie-nunu-bummed}}","replies":[{"poster":"Yasho The ADC","date":"2016-09-20T07:42:31.782+0000","up_votes":0,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Fitzky,realm=OCE,application-id=hIjvqaz6,discussion-id=81GJxvp1,comment-id=0001,timestamp=2016-09-16T01:42:33.285+0000)\n>\n> When you posted your champion concept 3 times and it got 0 attention despite having full visual description, abilities and a name {{sticker:zombie-nunu-bummed}}\n\nFeelsbadman, feelsbad","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Maraudaur","date":"2016-09-16T00:58:31.835+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey, seen the post will respond over the weekend!
