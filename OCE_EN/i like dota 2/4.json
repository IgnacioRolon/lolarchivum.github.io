Not because I think it&#039;s too high, but because of the difference between the range of her Q and the range of her E, with her Q being 1175 and her E being 1000. When trying to do a max range full Q E R combo to quickly burst someone down, giving them little time to react, her E doesn&#039;t fire, as I shoot the Q, then E, then R while the E&#039;s traveling, the game trys to move me into range when I E, but because I cast R it cancels the movement and doesn&#039;t fire the E, which can lead to them getting away when the E would have killed them. It might be a bit of a substantial nerf, so something else may need to be buffed, IDK.","replies":[]}
