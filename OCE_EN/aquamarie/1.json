When he splits himself ect would just look like splashing water and water globs.\r\n\r\nAnyway just an idea for Riot if they do in fact read this stuff :)","replies":[{"poster":"kJs","date":"2015-04-07T09:28:27.956+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Atlantean isn't it?","replies":[]},{"poster":"Lynxmetal","date":"2015-03-27T13:49:48.949+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Zac's pick rate is very low.

Zac is not a popular pick, so creating a new skin for him would not be very profitable. Whereas I just saw the PBE news and there's another Vayne skin around the corner, who is funnily enough one of the most popular champs at the moment.
