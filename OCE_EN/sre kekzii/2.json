I'm not sure whether this is just OCE or all servers (but I assume just OCE), I (and others) have had a constant disconnection loop in the client for chat (matchmaking isn't affected). The weird thing about it is that it's only for one of my accounts, I change to a different account and immediately the issue is resolved again. Unfortunately for me it's my main account. I've been memeing it all week but it actually sucks. Tonight a friend and I have also been getting randomly dc'd in game (Discord is fine, ping is consistently normal as well). Please, Riot, for fuck sake, help me out here. It's so painful to play this shit everyday. Thanks.","replies":[{"poster":"MarbleWraith","date":"2019-12-04T06:05:55.335+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Well the good news is since it's getting ported to android, i would think i client update is in order i.e. they just release a whole new client that's cross compatible with everything and provides consistent experience.\n\nThe bad news is this is riot we're talking about... their shit is *still* based on DX9","replies":[{"poster":"axeI","date":"2019-12-05T05:12:01.029+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"No client update/upgrade or improvement is in order. This client has been horrendous since it's release a few years ago. Every new patch breaks/hangs things, produces more bugs etc. \n\nThis billion dollar company cannot even produce a stable client without shoving relentless skins at our faces every patch. It's obvious where their marketing strategy is at. Riot is without doubt the most stupid video game company - even with disposable income and profits in their hands, they have never attempted to alleviate the client-side issues that have persisted for so long. It's almost embarrassing that they mention they're putting the \"S\" standard in their games when basic client functionality has been abysmal for years.\n\nDon't you worry though, next patch we'll see a rift of new skins, game balance updates and nothing citing improvements for the client.\n\nThis is stockholm syndrome. Everyone talks about how shitty this client is, Riot does nothing because they're not liable for the mess they create unless you open a law suit against them. You would think the whole scandal about gender discrimination would have taught them a lesson.\n\nFor real, anyone would think that in order to even play the game properly - you would require a client that is efficient, stable and optimised for any league of legends player. It may be a free to play game, but by god's word - this client is ridiculous and Riot get paid to do absolutely nothing about it. :)\n\nI would honestly recommend people to stop supporting this company through microtransactions, but we know their entire market audience and appeal are to weebs and mostly the chinese and korean league base.","replies":[]}]}]}
