Links to sign up will be included further down the post, thanks all! There are only 32 spots open so move fast to make sure you get in!\n\n**_Format_**\nEssentially, the format we'll be running with will be a Group Stage format, essentially, 32 players will be seeded into 4 groups of 8 players, for simplicity, we'll call them Groups A to D. All the groups will play 1 game and the bottom 4 of each group are eliminated, after the game, Group A and Group B will combine into another group of 8, meaning C and D will also follow-suit for another game. After that game is played, we'll have reached the final stage after we eliminate, yet again, the bottom 4 players in each group. The winner of the final stage will then be declared the No Sleep Palace TFT Cup Champion.\n\n**_Schedule_**\nThe tournament is scheduled for Saturday the 7th of September at 3:00 PM AEST, below is a estimated schedule for the event.\nRound of 32 - 3:00 PM AEST\nRound of 16 - 3:40 PM AEST\nFinal Stage - 4:20 PM AEST\nConclusion of Event - 5:00 PM AEST\n\n**_Signing Up_**\nAll players must be in the Discord to receive updates regarding the tournament, the discord link can be found below.

Is it a sanctioned tourny where the winner gets a Triumphant Ryze, or is it more of a \"Here's an RP giftcard\" sort of shindig, either way, I'm interested and may look into it further a little bit more down the track.","replies":[{"poster":"SRE Kekzii","date":"2019-08-27T01:47:54.047+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'm just going to break down your questions as we go - just so you're aware.\n\n_**>Is it a sanctioned tourny where the winner gets a Triumphant Ryze?**_\nNo, the only tournaments you'll find Triumphant Ryze being awarded in (usually coupled with RP) are the 5v5 competitive games.\n\n_**>Is it more of a \"Here's an RP giftcard\" sort of shindig?**_\nNot really, to give you perspective, the last event we ran Riot gave us Little Legends Eggs to give away, fitting in the theme of Teamfight Tactics.\n\nNot as many questions as I thought but too lazy to change formatting now! Great to hear you're interested, either way it's a great time to meet people and play some Teamfight Tactics together! Have a great afternoon. :)","replies":[{"poster":"Sesilan","date":"2019-08-27T17:28:40.507+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=SRE Kekzii,realm=OCE,application-id=6jGZAhT1,discussion-id=pcVeq17o,comment-id=00010000,timestamp=2019-08-27T01:47:54.047+0000)\n>\n> _**>Is it more of a \"Here's an RP giftcard\" sort of shindig?**_\n> Not really, to give you perspective, the last event we ran Riot gave us Little Legends Eggs to give away, fitting in the theme of Teamfight Tactics.\n\nCount me in.","replies":[{"poster":"SRE Kekzii","date":"2019-08-28T08:26:50.849+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Welcome aboard! :)","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"DarkShade918","date":"2019-08-24T07:24:00.915+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=SRE Kekzii,realm=OCE,application-id=6jGZAhT1,discussion-id=pcVeq17o,comment-id=,timestamp=2019-08-24T07:08:36.020+0000)\n>\n\n> **_Schedule_**\n> The tournament is scheduled for Saturday the **24th of August at 3:00 PM AEST**, below is a estimated schedule for the event.\n\nSomething's wrong here...","replies":[{"poster":"SRE Kekzii","date":"2019-08-24T07:43:09.228+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Ah, thank you haha, apologies, the tournament schedule and stuff was copy/pasted from the last tournament.","replies":[]}]}]}
