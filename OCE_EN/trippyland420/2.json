On NA and EUW i used to get great help, either its the people in OCE who help or the server itself that sucks. I am from Bangkok, Thailand, the lowest ping i have gotten was 140ms like 5-6 months back, since then the ping has gone to 300ms and whenever i ask for help in the support section, they just keep asking me for same shit again and again, the stupid network analysis and other reports. I AM DONE, check your freaking servers. check the connection of your servers with my city, because I play many other games and in none of those game, there is time that my ping goes so high. Take a stand for once in your lifetime you oceanic losers, and check your servers.","replies":[{"poster":"HORSE OF FORCE","date":"2015-05-14T01:58:49.770+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Well, I personally thought the service provided here for assistance was sub-par. Feels like I'm talking to robots who have short-term memory.\n\nNow, in order to help you, I have to ask you for some details (unfortunately). It's not like I can access your e-mail log or anything.\n\nCould you provide your ISP, OS, rough computer specs and any things you've tried in the past to improve your speed?","replies":[]}]}
