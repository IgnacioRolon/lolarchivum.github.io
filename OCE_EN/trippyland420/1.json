I own a macbook, and I know that it took long for us to get Mac support for league of legends international servers. I have been trying to get garena to start their support for Mac because here in Asia, we don&#039;t have an direct official riot server by riot, however we have garena but they don&#039;t support MAC.\r\n\r\nMy ping for EUW is normally 250-300\r\nMy ping for OCE is normally 160-240\r\n\r\nI hope you understand what I go through everytime I play League of legends. I would love to play with a low ping of 20 on the Thai or Singapore Servers but I am not able to.\r\n\r\nAll I am asking you is to please literally SPAM http://intl.garena.com/plus/ and prompt them to Support MAC because ALOT of people own MAC now a days and Its high time they start their support for MAC.\r\n\r\nThank you for reading and I hope you can show your support towards this great cause.","replies":[]}
