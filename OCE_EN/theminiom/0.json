(which is disgusting to look at)\r\n\r\nRyze, garen, nasus and so far trynamere have so far been unused.","replies":[{"poster":"Captain Fortune","date":"2017-10-16T03:43:06.121+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey Theminiom this is a pretty cool list! It's interesting to see what people think of the champions that they play and their reasonings behind it. \n\nI have noticed that you seem to like top laners a lot that are more on the tank side. If I may I have a few recommendations of champions that you may enjoy.\n\n----\n\n**Irelia**\nIrelia is my main pick for this giving a good balance of damage, cc, and ability to soak damage in a fight. She has a lot of life steal from her kit as well as a decent amount of mobility from her Blade Surge (Q). If you haven't already I would really recommend giving her a try, you can even flex her to mid lane if you would like.\n\n---\n\n**Gnar**\nI saw that you mentioned you weren't very good with kiting (the act of moving in between auto attacks), Gnar will give you good practice with this as its heavily needed for the laning phase in top lane as you will be heavily vsing melee champions that you will want to use your range advantage on. He will also give you good practice with engaging team fights with his GNAR! (R) and still give you that tanky game play that you enjoy.\n\n---\n\n**Malphite**\nThis is my last main one on the list and the main reason being is he is another tanky champion that you can play in the top lane with a heavy amount of engage for your team (very good against AD champions with the way his abilities work) and he is quite cheap from an IP perspective, only 1350 IP!\n\n---\n\nOther than that I would have a look into **Leona** for a support hero giving you a heavy amount of CC and that tank game play that you love. Along with that you could also look into **Jarvan IV** for a jungler and **Vi** as well, both of which can go tanky or damage depending on the situation letting you experience different play styles on the same champions.\n\nLet me know what you think, I hope this helped out, if you have any questions let me know! See you out there on the rfit!\n\n~Elam\n\n{{sticker:sg-ahri-2}}","replies":[{"poster":"theminiom","date":"2017-10-17T11:28:47.458+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thanks! i'll definetly look into them, although it'll be a while unless i want to purchase some Rp","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Lord Sesshomaru","date":"2017-10-13T21:21:45.115+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Well your champion pool isn't just:\n\nZed\nYasuo\nLee Sin\nTryndamere\n\nSo you're already ahead of 80% of people in league!\n\nPlus theres quite a few names in there like Mordekaiser, Skarner, Nunu, Fiddle, who are rare sights in todays games, and I'm all for diversity!\nYou've got the Sesshy tick of approval there! ;)\n\n{{sticker:slayer-pantheon-thumbs}}","replies":[]}]}
