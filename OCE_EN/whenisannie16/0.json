The second I had done a complete re-install of the game and it happened again. I got a warning and was placed in a low priority queue. I only just realised that they actually posted something on here about it. But essentially I done everything except what it says in that link. \n\nI don't really care I lost LP. I'm just a bit annoyed that I ruined my teams games by unintentionally being afk. I'm not very good at LoL, but I at least have respect and always try my best. And it's a little annoying I have to wait 5 mins to play a game now zz. \n\nTL;DR\n\nWhat happens to me now I'm in a low priority queue>?","replies":[{"poster":"HORSE OF FORCE","date":"2015-01-15T02:09:32.003+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You're stuck there, FOREVER.","replies":[]}]}
