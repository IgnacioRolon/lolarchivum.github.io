It&#039;s Sythine on OCE and I&#039;m not sure which of my emails the account is associated with. There&#039;s one email account that I think it might be associated with that I&#039;ve since lost the ability to access. \n\nJust wondering if there&#039;s any way I can find the email associated with the account (even just the first few characters and host) or get my account back. I&#039;d leveled it quite a bit and it&#039;s pretty upsetting that I no longer have access to it. I&#039;ve pretty much got a plethora of ways to prove that it&#039;s my account besides the email it&#039;s associated with or the password. \n\nOtherwise I&#039;m just going to keep having to guess the password :\\\n\nEDIT: actually I think I just forgot the username, I should know the password to it. \n\nEDIT2: Also just filed a ticket","replies":[{"poster":"SephirothSG","date":"2016-03-09T05:04:12.150+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey there,\n\nIf you've already submitted a support ticket (Which it sounds like you have) you'll have to wait for a reply from them and begin the account recovery process afaik.\n\nAs this is an account related issue we here on the boards aren't able to help you.","replies":[]}]}
