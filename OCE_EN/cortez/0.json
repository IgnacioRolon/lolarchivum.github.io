It can take a day or two for tracking on a package to be available, so if you ordering in the last 48 hours I wouldn't be worried. If it's been longer than that I still wouldn't get too worried, but you can submit a ticket to player support and they should be able to help you.\n\nhttps://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/requests/new","replies":[{"poster":"Cortez","date":"2018-05-02T23:37:42.512+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Bro its nearly been a month. I submitted a ticket to riot support about 2 weeks ago and still haven't heard back. I'm wondering if it was a waste of 25usd.\nEdit: I was told the order had been shipped on April the 6th and it is now May the 3rd.\n","replies":[{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2018-05-03T01:17:53.842+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"In my experience with the merch shop it does take a long time for stuff to arrive to OCE, but I would recommend submitting a second ticket. They pretty much always respond within 2 days, so I'm not sure why you didn't get as response unless you kept bumping the ticket (replying to it before receiving a response bumps it back down the queue).","replies":[{"poster":"Cortez","date":"2018-05-17T08:47:21.065+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It got here two days later. Also I didn't ever bump the ticket. In my experience, they usually never or take a really long time to reply. Still haven't been replied to on that ticket.
