Why? Well hes a catfish and i think he could have flippers for feet and a float around his belly and his passive would be rubber duckies and when he would use q he would have water come out of his mouth. His w would spit a puddle of water out and his e would be blue not gray. His ult would have a bucket you jump into on the end of his tounge and would make a wave when teleporting.","replies":[{"poster":"Miicka","date":"2016-08-05T10:50:37.607+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I have never thought of this before, it's a really cool idea too, I can just imagine Kench in a pool part outfit xD\n\nI think Pool Party Illaoi should be a thing as well.","replies":[{"poster":"TwilightP3nguin","date":"2017-01-17T22:42:46.481+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Agreed about the {{champion:420}}  thing :D","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"TwilightP3nguin","date":"2017-01-17T22:41:36.576+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I say he should be just one of those rubber floaty things you sometimes see in the kiddy pool part of pools and I like the idea of the q being water and his w and e as well, but his ult shouldn't be a wave cuz it'd look like a norm. skin {{champion:267}} ult so it should be more of something like the bucket as you suggested or just diving off of a diving board into something and reappearing out of a small pool or a life preserver, eh?","replies":[]}]}
