Now, more than two years after the debut of our first game mode, we're announcing a rotating queue that'll bring the alternative action on weekends with a suite of familiar game modes and maybe a fresh face or two.","url":"http://na.leagueoflegends.com/en/news/game-updates/gameplay/announcing-rotating-game-mode-queue","image":"http://na.leagueoflegends.com/sites/default/files/styles/wide_medium/public/upload/rgm.jpg?itok=WEqbWG8R"},"up_votes":4,"down_votes":1,"body":"I&#039;ll try to keep this short, but I feel there&#039;s a key factor everyone is glossing over when they write on the incoming Rotating Queue. (Especially with the hot topic of April Fools on everyone&#039;s minds)\r\n\r\nThere is a game mode ***every weekend***, One For All, Urf. They&#039;re all available.\r\nUrf is not the only mode, and I&#039;m lead to believe each game mode is returning once every 2-3 months.\r\n\r\nIt&#039;s a net benefit when you stop thinking about only one game mode at a time-\r\n**And you don&#039;t have to wait another entire year to experience those game modes**\r\n\r\nIt&#039;s the worst thing ever when you have family gatherings or events on that force you to miss out on majority (or the entirety) of a fun-mode, and you know you have an entire year before you&#039;re going to see it again.\r\n\r\nDon&#039;t shoot Riot&#039;s upcoming changes in the foot before you&#039;ve actually been able to experience them, lest you find yourself unable to enjoy Rotating Queue for lamenting &quot;the good old days&quot;.","replies":[]}
