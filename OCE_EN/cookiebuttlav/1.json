The best you can do against a flamer is talk to the rest of your team and don't even respond to the toxic player. You can private message all the players with the /r*space**tab*'Name' to not respond to the person and just do your best teamwork with the rest of the nice players.\nIf everybody did this every game I guarantee toxic players would be a rare sight as they'd quickly realize how far being toxic gets them.\n\nThere was no point for you to write this whole thing.","replies":[{"poster":"CookieButtLav","date":"2016-04-18T18:49:09.592+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I made sure to report, and indeed for most of the game, I was able to ignore, focussing more on getting Jhin fed and keeping bot lane above the rest of the enemy team-\nBut I kinda snapped at the last five minutes.
