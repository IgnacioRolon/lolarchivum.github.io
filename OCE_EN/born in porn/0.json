So i asked in all chat for them to end. but instead that makes them just play super passive and accept the free kills from akali. \nWHY SHOULD I HAVE TO PLAY FOR 20 MINUITS??\nThere should be a built in system where you can have a team vote to end the to surrender pre 20. Obviously this would get abused by some flamers but this would stop the situations like this where Im probably going to get a que ban for not playing this BULLSH1T \ncurrently 15 mins in and she is 0-13 with 3 boots","replies":[{"poster":"Nijel","date":"2016-03-26T02:53:16.939+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"It sucks when someone takes your role and then proceeds to troll but that doesn't mean you can't try to have fun anyway.
