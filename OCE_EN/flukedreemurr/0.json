I honestly feel like it was neglected to be mentioned when exactly this lockout was to occur. I&#039;m pretty much an ADC main and have been working super hard to get the prestige KDA Kai&#039;Sa skin since it was revealed, only to fall exactly 84 tokens short. If there is anything I could do to get some more time to earn such tokens, or even just buy the remainder upfront, I would like to know. I&#039;m honestly heartbroken after my rough month of hard-work for it to end in nought. If someone could get back to me on this as to what to do it would be greatly appreciated.","replies":[{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2018-11-21T01:59:16.167+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"So the tokens were always slated to end on [November 20, 2018 at 18:59 p.m. AEDT](https://oce.leagueoflegends.com/en/news/game-updates/special-event/learn-more-worlds-season-2018-event).
