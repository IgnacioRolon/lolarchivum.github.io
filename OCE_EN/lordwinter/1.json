I just joined an aram. about 15 minutes ago. We were doing REALLLLLY good because the enemy Garen was so upset because one of his allies rerolled blitz.... So garen was intentionally feeding and building mana items.  HOW THE FRUIT CAKE can we all report him if you just gonna nuke us out of our game like Kim Jong Yung is threatening to nuke the rest of the world with no valid reason! I live for arams, I ONLY play arams. I not only LOVE arams but I LOVE my allies and I LOVE my enemies. I use 9 honors at the end of some games and DONT expect ANY back if it was a great game.\r\n  BUT this Garen was so upset! He had one of the ULTIMATE ARAM champs and built mana regen items!!! His team was devastated, they were pleading with him to not make them all upset and cry. WE ALSO the enemies of this GAREN were ALSO pleading with him to stop the PJsalt express and embrace the Garen AWESOMENESS and not feed intentionally ( he was 2/13/something) at this time. And then he threated us with his explosive he would carry the team and he ulted our carry and killed them.....\r\n\r\n 20 seconds later.... The game lost all connection because RIOT booted everyone out of the universe. So this troll Garen, who probably lives every waking moment angry and upset joins into League of Legends PURELY to troll if he can&#039;t get his way and there is NOTHING no one, NOT the allies or the enemies can do about it. He is IMMUNE because RIOT will not let games in progress FINISH. \r\n\r\n  SO theres my 2 cents. (5cents actually we got rid of 1&#039;s and 2&#039;s years ago).  PLEASE RIOT let us FINISH our games. Do the boot reset kill command on the people clicking to join games, not the ones that are 15-20 minutes in and doing &quot;non esport endorsed modes like arams&quot;... hell Im scared if I was in a dominion.... People play games for the fun and the game,. And if you want to say this is a fun game, watch any streamer out there cursing and complaining and then having their HUDS filled with gold farmer content and its LEGAL even though it should not be","replies":[{"poster":"SkarSkarSkarner","date":"2016-06-15T01:21:17.511+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"They give a time when the maintenance is going to happen.
