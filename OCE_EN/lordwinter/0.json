But after playing over 1000 arams on this account (1300 on my other account, which also has over 1000 dominion games from pre OCE server becoming online), this game mode is just getting worse and worse.\r\n   Yeah the Poro king game mode event was fun, for 3-5 games or so, but then people realised that Tanky bruisers win the game. Just use the poro summoner ability, go in and NUKE  ...\r\n Now Riot has implemented this Poro (Mark its now called) ability into the game mode permanent.. Pretty much, any tanky champ, bruiser, or anyone can just hit the mark on a low health champ and zoom/mega flash in and insta kill them. Even in they are full health, they can just teleport using this Mark to go in and mess up them then get away for the AP champs mainly to kill.\r\n   The problem is that once where skill, rerolling champs, and adjusting your team to have a front line (tanky champs), a middle group who could either cover or take out low champs, and then the back line, be they the ranged adcs or ap champs don&#039;t exist. \r\n  The game mode has become a mess of Garens/Poppy&#039;s/Full AP blitzcranks/and other bruiser champs getting the limelight. \r\n     And NOW we have bilgewater Event.. The mess has gotten even more messy and the new &#039;aram/bilgewater&#039; players just don&#039;t care. They just want to troll their team (I&#039;m guessing they are either bored of losing/queing at same time as friends to be on enemy side/or just do not have a clue and non stop call people bronze noobs etc, because they fail to realise this is ARAM not ranked~!\r\n\r\nSo Sorry about the long post, etc, but MANY players do not wish to be non stop verbally abused, have kids or immature people stating they F**ked your mum, and afking in a bush because they are high on drugs or whatever, just want a break! Want to be able to play a NON normal/ranked game mode and not have to deal with the troll/immature kids in our arams. \r\n\r\n So CAN we get Dominons into our server (EVEN IF IT JUST DURING THESE EVENTS), CAN we not have a game mode (arams) perverted by a EVENT (Like this Bilgewater one and the PORO king one), which just RUINS the gameplay. Yeah, Riot says its about the que times... But the people know its about $$MONEY%% and Ranks/Watching Streams make young Kids/adolescent teens think they can make it big in the Esport scene, and 99% of them wont! \r\n\r\nSo Bring Dominons into the scene and REMOVE MARK (AKA PORO TOSS). \r\n\r\n   Thankyou","replies":[{"poster":"Zorphiax","date":"2015-07-27T11:55:15.902+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Dude most of those comments there just indicate how skilled the enemy is and how much of a wuss you are being -1 on the overall forum +1 on dominion.","replies":[]}]}
