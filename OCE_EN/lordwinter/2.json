I currently have 115k IP (I used 2 change names just to waste some (28k worth), but there is nothing I can use this IP for. Can&#039;t buy champs, every rarely now and again a quick easy created summoner icon I can buy, but those are as rare as hens teeth. \r\n\r\n I think it would be great if we could convert them, but there has to be requirements.\r\n\r\n1. Player must have spent at least $50 dollars buying RIOT Points\r\n\r\n2. Player must have most of the champions, not including the last 2 new champs that have entered summoners rift (2 weeks from them being made available to the servers, the player must acquire them before they can convert IP to RP)\r\n\r\n3. Players must have acquired a minimum of 50k IP at the least (not including extra IP gained from bonus IP from any source (paid for, earned through completing random events - LIke Ocean week, etc, or through server downtimes etc.)\r\n\r\nObviously it can&#039;t be a BIG amount conversion, but even 1000 IP for 50 RP would be great. Would give alot of long time players who have way too much IP to actually do anything with it, something to do with it. \r\n\r\nJust my thoughts, but I think it would be very viable for the long time support and dedication we have shown playing this game :)\r\n\r\nPeace Out, no flame comments thanks!","replies":[{"poster":"Sydanus","date":"2016-01-23T16:48:51.645+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yes Please!!!\nFor those who don't want to do the math 20k IP = 1k RP.\nThis seems like a pretty fair conversion rate but the $50 spent requirement does feel a little bit mean. Keep in mind that IP takes a long time to earn for most players so this would realistically be pretty fair without the requirements.","replies":[{"poster":"Sydannus","date":"2016-01-23T16:49:40.557+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Y was i logged into NA?! *-*","replies":[]}]}]}
