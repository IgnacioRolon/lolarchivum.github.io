Only way I have managed to solve this is to quit the client and reload it, this is obviously annoying and something I&#039;m disappointed about in the new client. I haven&#039;t seen anyone address this issue so forgive me if this has already been reported.","replies":[{"poster":"Rhynal","date":"2017-06-11T12:07:23.071+0000","up_votes":0,"down_votes":0,"body":"https://www.facebook.com/rhynal.chand.1/videos/1317169361735056/   #Glitch","replies":[]}]}
