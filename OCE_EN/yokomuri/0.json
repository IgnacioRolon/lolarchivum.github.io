Since you've already tried to repair it, I'd definitely try out forcing a Re-Patch.\n\nIf that doesn't work - go through the steps to do a [full reinstall](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/202539040-Reinstalling-League-of-Legends) (I know you said you tried reinstalling, but make sure you read here to ensure that it you get rid of ALL files first).\n\nLet me know how it goes.\n\nMindstar","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"I Am Number 4ht","date":"2015-08-20T06:58:57.595+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I am also stuck on files scanned.
