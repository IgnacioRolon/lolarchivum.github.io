The Aphae Waterfall in its own right was a beautiful sight behold, but, with the final rays of the evening sunset casting over it, it seemed that much more amazing.\r\n\r\nIt seemed magical even.\r\n\r\nThis was a favourite spot of theirs, especially for her. The last time that they were here, Xayah had fallen in love with the beauty of the place and had the desire to visit the wondrous place again.\r\n\r\n&ldquo;You remember the Aphae Waterfall?&rdquo; She had asked her lover, Rakan, during their travels.\r\n\r\nA simple was nod her response at the time, accompanied by a small smile that tugged at his lips. He had fond memories of the place as well, having found the beauty and magic in it as well.\r\n\r\n&ldquo;I&rsquo;d like to go there again.&rdquo;\r\n\r\nRakan&rsquo;s smile widens slightly at the time as he snaked an arm around her waist, pulling her in a little and resting his forehead slightly against hers. He too had the desire to visit the waterfall again and perhaps they would soon enough.\r\n\r\n&ldquo;Well, try not to die then.&rdquo; He had said teasingly, his smile turning into a grin.\r\n\r\nXayah rolled her eyes a little at what had been his remark. She should have expected such a response like that but she couldn&rsquo;t help but have laughed little in response, leaning her forehead against his and wrapping her arms around his waist, simply enjoying the moment with her lover.\r\n\r\nAnd now, here they were once again. The Aphae Waterfall.\r\n\r\nThey sat off to one side of the flowing water, Rakan with his back against a tree, his arms wrapped around Xayah who sat between his legs, leaning back against him, watching the water as it flowed over the edge. Despite what many may have thought, or even what Rakan may have thought, there had been much on Xayah&rsquo;s mind recently. Particularly that of an entity that has been unspoken for many, many years.\r\n\r\nThe Void.\r\n\r\nOver the years of having travelled with Rakan, she had heard bits and pieces, rumours of the devastation that affected Icathia. It sent shivers down her spine, making her shudder in Rakan&rsquo;s grasp. Would that be the fate of her beloved Ionia? Would their home succumb to such a fate? Was the whole world doomed to be destroyed by this&hellip;thing?\r\n\r\nWould she lose her love&hellip;Rakan&hellip;to this thing?\r\n\r\nShe wouldn&rsquo;t admit it to anyone but this&hellip;Void, scared her to her core. If it was capable of wiping out an entire civilisation, if the rumours held true of course, then was there really any hope of combating it?\r\n\r\n&ldquo;Babe?&rdquo; Rakan asked softly, looking down at Xayah, having felt her shudder. &ldquo;Are you alright?&rdquo;\r\n\r\nA small sigh left her lips as she turned her gaze, staring out at the setting sun as the last of it dipped below the horizon, taking away all the light it had shared. Warmth turned to a lack of warmth as the night began once again.\r\n\r\n&ldquo;I&rsquo;m fine. Just a lot on my mind.&rdquo; Was her response.\r\n\r\n&ldquo;Care to share what&rsquo;s on your mind then?&rdquo;\r\n\r\nRakan knew Xayah was hiding something, holding back on telling him. She always did this when she didn&rsquo;t want to share something or was pushing herself too much. While it was all well and good she wanted to return Ionia to its former glory and their race to her idea of its former glory, but pushing herself too hard or keeping things hidden would get her no closer to that goal.\r\n\r\nSilence fell between the two of them once again as Xayah thought over her fears and worries. Were they really worth sharing currently? All she had heard so far was only rumours but if they were only rumours why did she have a feeling of dread?\r\n\r\n&ldquo;Rumours.&rdquo; She replied quietly. &ldquo;Rumours about something I had heard about.&rdquo;\r\n\r\nRakan kept his gaze on Xayah, his head tilted to one side a little. He narrowed his brow a little at her response, trying to discern what she could have been talking about. What rumours? He hasn&rsquo;t really heard anything in recent times. Then again, he doesn&rsquo;t pay much attention to anything else other than her or how amazing he looks.\r\n\r\n&ldquo;Rumours?&rdquo; He questioned, now looking and sounding confused. &ldquo;About what?&rdquo;\r\n\r\nXayah looked up at him, an eyebrow raised in question. How could he have not heard the rumours as well? Although, while it did surprise her, it wasn&rsquo;t completely surprising either.\r\n\r\n&ldquo;About a thing called The Void.&rdquo;\r\n\r\n_That_ got his attention. That was something he had definitely heard about before. Now that she was mentioning it, Rakan knew what she was talking about and what she may have been referring to but he was still confused.\r\n\r\n&ldquo;I see. Why the sudden interest?&rdquo;\r\n\r\nXayah sighed a little. She leaned back further, leaning a little more heavily on Rakan. Opening up about things was _not_ her forte.\r\n\r\n&ldquo;If it&rsquo;s true that that&hellip;thing, destroyed the land of Icathia so easily, then what&rsquo;s to stop it from undoing all the hard work we&rsquo;ve done?&rdquo; She asked, giving a sweeping gesture to the land around them.\r\n\r\nRakan hummed softly, holding onto his love a little tighter, now understanding her worry. He glanced around and at the valley below. He and Xayah had worked hard to restore the magic to Ionia and it had never been easy. There had always been a few close calls.\r\n\r\n&ldquo;Then we show this Void who&#039;s boss.\r\n\r\nThat was it? That was all he had to say? &lsquo;We show this Void thing who&#039;s boss?&rsquo; No sugar coating it? Trying to change the topic or unnecessary reassurances?\r\n\r\n&ldquo;That&rsquo;s it? That&rsquo;s all you&rsquo;re going to say?&rdquo;\r\n\r\nIt was Rakan&rsquo;s turn to sigh. What else was he supposed to say? A seemingly unstoppable force bent on destroying the world? What could be said?\r\n\r\n&ldquo;There is going to come a time where we have to part this world, Xayah. Whether it because of this Void or because our time here is up, it&rsquo;ll come but I do know one thing for a fact.&rdquo;\r\n\r\nRakan paused for a moment, a smile tugging at his lips as he looked down at her and she looked up at him. &ldquo;When that time comes, whether soon or later, we will go down together, kicking and screaming.&rdquo;\r\n\r\nXayah huffed lightly, a smile tugging at her lips as well as her hopes were filled and lifted once again. Yes. Rakan was right. They would have to leave at some point but they would go down together, no matter what.\r\n\r\n&ldquo;Now, if we are done with all the mopey stuffs.&rdquo; Rakan said as he jumped to his feet, pulling Xayah up with him. &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s do some restoring of Ionia&#039;s magic and show The Void whose boss!&rdquo;\r\n\r\nWith a flashy grin, Rakan started running off back the way they had come originally, stopping after a moment to look back at Xayah.\r\n\r\n&ldquo;Coming?&rdquo;\r\n\r\nXayah grinned. She preferred working at night and now was the perfect time to do said work. \r\n\r\n_This is going to be a good night._ She thought as she took off after her lover, her worries dissuaded.\r\n\r\n**_Note: Any all feedback will be greatly appreciated! Hopefully I can use said feedback in future writing contests._**","replies":[{"poster":"Buttercup","date":"2018-03-08T10:10:28.580+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"This is nice; it's a really good way of adding character to both Xayah and Rakan by contrasting how the two react to an unknown quantity. It reads like a conversation that a couple would have lying in bed about earthquakes, or something similar.\n\nI do notice that you sometimes get into the habit of telling, rather than showing; see this paragraph here, especially:\n\n_This was a favourite spot of theirs, especially for her. The last time that they were here, Xayah had fallen in love with the beauty of the place and had the desire to visit the wondrous place again._\n\nIt's hard to imagine what's so beautiful about it, aside from the fact that it's a waterfall that has extremely good natural lighting. As a result, we don't learn anything about Xayah from this paragraph either, because we don't understand what she loves about this place.\n\nCompare it to this sentence a few lines below it:\n\n_Rakanâ€™s smile widens slightly at the time as he snaked an arm around her waist, pulling her in a little and resting his forehead slightly against hers. _\n\nThis is great. This one sentence shows me everything. The smile, the arm, the forehead; you're showing me so much about Rakan just by describing what he's doing. The smile shows me he's cheeky, the arm shows me he's protective of Xayah, and the forehead motion shows me he cares.\n\nAnother line that really stuck out as an example of this was here:\n\n_Xayah sighed a little. She leaned back further, leaning a little more heavily on Rakan. Opening up about things was not her forte._\n\nAgain, this is great, Xayah is sighing, indicating that she's unsure of what to say next, and she's leaning into Rakan, indicating that she wants him to help her express her feelings. You don't even need to mention that opening up isn't her forte, your previous sentence already showed us that.\n\nHope this helps; you have a really sweet story, with a lot of great writing. Try to to keep the focus on the showing, rather than the telling!","replies":[{"poster":"ShadowfireAngel","date":"2018-03-09T03:29:10.419+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thank you for taking the time to respond with some feedback, I really appreciate it.\n\nThe whole telling instead of showing aspect of my story writing is something that I am aware slips through on occasion and I do my best to reverse that where I can. So, with you having picked up on that and having it pointed out to me, I greatly appreciate it. It shows me where I have fallen down a little.\n\nMy biggest fear coming into writing this was how it would read. It is sometimes hard to capture the essence of a character without straying too far outside of what is considered the 'norm' for them. With someone like Xayah who we constantly see as being a 'gruff' and 'tough' character, I wasn't quite sure, and quite frankly, hesitant, about writing her in a way that shows her as 'vulnerable.' However, I'm glad that seems to have worked out and that you seemed to enjoy the story. Makes me as an author feel like I've done a good job.\n\nThank you again for your feedback and I will make sure to file it away in my mind for my future works!","replies":[]}]}]}
