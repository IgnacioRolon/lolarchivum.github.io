However, waking up in the morning today (01/01/2016) a warning pops up saying &quot;**The internet access you are about to view uses a certificate that has expired or is not valid. Do you wish to proceed?**&quot; And now I am not sure how to remove it. I have seen many posts saying that it is caused due to having the incorrect date but I have made sure that the date, time and year are all correct and it still pops up. I tried uninstalling League of Legends and reinstalling it but it is still currently in the process of doing so. If anyone is able to help it would be much appreciated!
