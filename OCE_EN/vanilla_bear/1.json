The same goes vice versa too. I've tried to reinstall but I'll give a clean reinstall a go if there's nothing else I can do","replies":[{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2017-06-04T11:22:09.866+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Assuming your graphics drivers are up to date it's the best I've got.\n\nMight be worth double checking your permissions too: https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/204134104-Setting-up-your-Permissions","replies":[{"poster":"Vanilla Bear","date":"2017-06-05T20:55:00.208+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Seras Dragon,realm=OCE,application-id=ElA0rvVL,discussion-id=cfPuMTfk,comment-id=0001000000000001000000000000,timestamp=2017-06-04T11:22:09.866+0000)\n>\n> Assuming your graphics drivers are up to date it&#x27;s the best I&#x27;ve got.\n> \n> Might be worth double checking your permissions too: https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/204134104-Setting-up-your-Permissions\n\nMy permissions seem to be fine. I can't really be bothered looking into this much more given I know how to fix it in game now.
