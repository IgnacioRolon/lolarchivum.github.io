A bunch of people that will play with you to have fun and learn to improve, and not mind when you aren't doing so well.","replies":[]},{"poster":"BarryButcher","date":"2016-09-24T03:51:43.410+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"ASAP. I started when I was around level 20. Was a little late since ofcourse EVERYONE jumps into ranked once they hit 30 whether they are ready or not.\n\nIt will save you a lot of trouble down the road to get good early. Even if you get pummeled, atleast you've learnt something.\n\nI'd say get TIer 2 runes, since they are only 1 IP each and go for it.\n\nAlso mute people instantly if they are being negative. dont bother \"letting it slide\", people are assholes and its better to not listen to them","replies":[]},{"poster":"EzeBlood","date":"2016-09-24T01:08:40.354+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"asap.

You'll probably do pretty bad since you are new and don't have runes (only buy tier 3 runes) but you'll pick up alot of experience and a keystone is enough to at least give you a chance. Once you do get lvl30 and runes you'll be whooping people though since you'll have reached a point where you didn't need runes to win.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Essembie","date":"2016-09-25T03:23:48.950+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"at the start of a ranked season.

I was a bit hesitant but I played with a friend (duo bot) and the first few games I basically followed him around the map / he told me where I should be, when to go aggressive etc\n\nin pvp, your opponents will*: dodge your skillshots, counter attack, bait you into a bad situation, recognise when they are ahead of you and be more aggressive / shut you out of lane, actually have a jungler who ganks you when you are too far forwards (or when they can tower dive you), employ lv1 cheese strategies.\n\nAnd while this may seem offputting, you only learn how to deal with all this by experiencing it yourself and reflecting on what you did that worked (warding, map awareness, safe positioning) and what didn't (tunnel visioned on a specific enemy, not respecting all-in potential, being too passive).\n\nApologies in advance for the games where a fed enemy {{champion:55}} face-rolls everyone on your team.\n\nAll the best!\n*maybe ranked more-so than normals.","replies":[]},{"poster":"hðnkƒørÇªmíllè","date":"2016-09-24T22:56:16.166+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The second you reach a high enough level to start playing PVP instead of bots, I say go for it. You learn so much more from playing against other human players as opposed to Riots grand AI bots.
