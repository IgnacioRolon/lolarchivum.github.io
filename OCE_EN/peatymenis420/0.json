It was a novelty on the poro king game-mode but this has just gotten old. It only buffs assassins and tanks who can start fights incredible easily and guess what happens when you don&#039;t get those type of champs on you simply lose. They need to be removed and aram returned to what it once was.","replies":[{"poster":"ƒamous","date":"2015-09-27T03:34:49.754+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It's only ARAM.

If ya get what i mean. Yes they are easy to dodge but when there is 5 champs in the field someones gonna get hit most likely. And if the person is in close proximity to say a half hp squishy. That squishy is dead. The leblanc, fizz, wukong etc. Have become way to strong.","replies":[{"poster":"ƒamous","date":"2015-09-27T06:06:33.619+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Oh true. My bad. I do agree that some champions have become OP because of it, but if you were an assassin, surely you'd take advantage of the ability. It's fun when you can outplay people with it too.

That was not a big issue with the old aram and the fights actually had some sort of skill rather than an assasin landing a mark on a half health squishy and going in for the insta pop.
