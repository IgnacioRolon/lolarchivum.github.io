I used to main him, since the last patch. When I saw they were gonna \"work on him\" I had some doubts about what they will do on him, and it's a total deception. Even if they said it was only to add some \"Counterplay possibilities\" to a champion a lot of people call a \"b***h champ\". Maybe his nerf was justified, maybe not. But to me it's kinda ironic to nerf a champion like veigar, aka an underrated champ, instead of nerfing zed, riven or graves ( or irelia plox ). So now I want to know, since the rework made veigar a totally new champion ( skillshot A, easily dodgeable cage and weaker ulti ) I want to know if by any mean riot can refund skin on this champion ? I actually own 4 skins : FB, Bad Santa, White Mage and Gandalf veigar. They're all really nice, but since to me the champion is unplayable, I don't have any utility of these skins.","replies":[{"poster":"HORSE OF FORCE","date":"2015-02-28T10:30:52.949+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":">weaker ulti\n\nNot counting the fact you get AP stacked a lot easier now?\n\nAnd better nerf Irelia.\n\nReworks and changes to champions are Riot's efforts to keep the game interesting, fresh and balanced. Of course there will be instances where your favourite champion will recieve a change that you don't like, but never so much as to make them unviable/warrant a refund.\n\nIf anything, I like it when champions I play are nerfed, because that means that less people will be playing them, hence I'll be more unique. And it's so much more rewarding to win a game with a weak champion than it is to with a strong one.","replies":[]}]}
