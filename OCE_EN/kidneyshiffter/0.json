The game runs consistently at 19-24ms then everything on the screen will freeze and stop moving for usually about 1 second but sometimes longer. then my ping goes up to like 400-500ms and suddenly the game catches up and all the champs basically teleport around I don't see them move. then lag goes back to normal. It happens every 2 - 3 minutes. sometimes even more frequently. Everyone just kept telling me it was bad internet. I had someone staying in the spare room I thought maybe they were doing something. A few days ago they moved out and I have the connection just to myself now, so I upgraded from NBN50 to NBN100. I get 92-96mbps up and down on speedtest, I can play other games with no lag at all. But league still has these same lag spikes. They make ranked completely unplayable. and having to play norms every day is so tilting. I'm running the latest video and network drivers and the spikes happen the same on both the computers I use to play.\r\n\r\nWhat else could they be if it's not the internet connection and it's only happening to league?","replies":[{"poster":"Fridgee","date":"2019-05-27T11:02:12.809+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I have just recently started having this same issue, ive added you in game if you find the fix it would be greatly appreciated","replies":[{"poster":"Kidneyshiffter","date":"2019-06-12T04:18:12.591+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Fridgee,realm=OCE,application-id=ElA0rvVL,discussion-id=I3H3jqLa,comment-id=0000,timestamp=2019-05-27T11:02:12.809+0000)\n>\n> I have just recently started having this same issue, ive added you in game if you find the fix it would be greatly appreciated\n\nI still haven't found a solution.
