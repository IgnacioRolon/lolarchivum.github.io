I play twisted fate, Kassadin and ekko atm. Had a 8 win streak with TF and have a decent win rate with him. Does this mean I should keep playing him? Also I frequently go into games and get too self absorbed in the game and forget everything that I have learnt therefore not play how I should. Any tips on this? Also any good top lane champs as it is my second role. And how do I deal with players who clearly don&rsquo;t understand the game. For instance I had a top laner that was say 0/4 and keep trying to get kills even though he was behind. Like he could have literally played passive farmed up and even become ahead item wise but instead trying to get kills. Like I kno I&rsquo;m bronze but I feel like I have decent knowledge of the game past bronze. I feel like most bronze players just want kills and &ldquo;objectives&rdquo; are not a thing. And they don&rsquo;t understand the importance of wards and positioning on the map. A lot of the time I feel like no one listens to you in chat and/or just tilts so easily. Most of the time it feels like it&rsquo;s luck if I get a brain dead team or not. Anytips on how to deal with this and get people to work together and play the game properly?\r\n\r\nSorry for the paragraph and rambling on but I really need an opinion on this. Thanks for reading.","replies":[{"poster":"Sn4ke","date":"2018-02-04T10:15:43.145+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"If you do intend to play Top which is probably something you really shouldn't play as Fitzky said but play Meta champions like Maokai and Nasus. Tanks are the meta in the top lane but picks like Riven and Irelia can still work. For the mid lane i suggest you play AP champions as everyone plays AD in low elo. Akali is really good for carrying and climbing in games same with Katarina but they do have high skill ceilings. Good champions for mid would be Orianna and Vladimir for AP and for AD I'd say Zed & Katarina but you do have to get good at them before you play ranked. Hope this helped and good luck!","replies":[{"poster":"SOOM","date":"2018-02-04T18:08:06.261+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Didnâ€™t realize kat was AD","replies":[{"poster":"Sn4ke","date":"2018-02-05T05:22:39.533+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Whoops my bad","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"WilliK","date":"2018-02-04T13:11:18.459+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Ok thank you for the advice!

She's good at most things, amazing at roaming, extremely safe, scales decently, and has no real hard counters (yasou tends to be a case, don't get baited into throwing all your skillshots into windwall, and harass him with autos when he's doing his dashy dashy to proc the shield, and when he gets close, throw your q out perpendicular to his windwall as you start moving in an angle away from him, forcing him to disengage or risk getting charm'd and bursted while he waits for windwall to come back up).\n\nAnnie is also pretty good if you're confident, though she suffers more in reliability in poke matchups.\n\nStatistically Annivia is the best midlane champion gold and below. I don't know why, maybe it's the huge AoE damage just brute forcing teamfights, or the Egg making her less susceptible to poorly coordinated dives, or the waveclear helping to seige. I think she's a bit hard to play but she does win alot more.","replies":[{"poster":"Nightjar","date":"2018-02-04T22:31:15.162+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"also on toplaners, there's alot of mechanics to learn, but the best toplaners gold and below, atm are singed, nasus, teemo and garen.\nSinged isn't really that great for improving at league, since he's somewhat counterintuitive and requires you to be able to estimate where the jungler is with a fair degree of accuracy.\nNasus is about how well you know how to survive a losing lane, since you need to understand how to freeze and how to scale.\nTeemo is about harassing and zoning and knowing how to read jungle pressure so you can ruin the enemy toplaners experience.\nGaren is about spinning.","replies":[]}]}]}
