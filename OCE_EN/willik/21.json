In S7 he was my main and late S7 came round he felt kind of weak almost? Just wondering if anyone sees him to be good in certain matchups. I also never see people play rumble. He seems really unpopular and i feel like riot has forgotten about him. it kinda makes me sad considering he seems to be &ldquo;left out&rdquo; or has always never been in the best spot.

His statistics for Jungle would be different. For one, Jungle Rumble is harder to do, mainly because he isn't designed for Jungle as much as he is for Top). For another, those that play Rumble Jungle have also played a lot of Rumble so understand his mechanics.\n\nHope this helps :D\n\n{{sticker:sg-ahri-2}}","replies":[]}]}
