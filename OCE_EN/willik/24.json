I really am confused with everything. Videos on youtube are saying do this/do that while others are giving complete opposite opinions. Currently idk what roles i like and idk what champions to play. I main mid and had a phase where i would play ad. I seem to always be switching roles and champions. however i primarily play mid and enjoy jungle and top. Im super confused on what champions to play as everyone says play meta while others say play what you like. Currently i play tf, fizz kassadin, ekko and zoe mid. I enjoy playing fiora, Darius, riven, jax and kha as well. Can anyone tell me if all these champs are good for climbing, and some tips to help. also is it ok to have say 3 champs per role to play? and people say to get out of bronze you literally just needa use your head and think is this true? i think im to focused on being a challenger player and im trying to improve everything at once is this why im finding everything confusing?","replies":[{"poster":"Doctor Dunk","date":"2018-02-21T04:39:12.986+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"The first season I start playing in was season 5, I got placed in bronze 1 or 2 (Can't remember). Back then I used to have issues with mana usage so the champions I played would either be resourceless (Zac) or high mana regen champs (Veigar with his old passive). While I generally did ok with these champs, I was never able to win game after game. It wasn't I bought more champions that I found that I really enjoy certain champions. As i'm sure my name gives it away, from then on I almost only played {{champion:122}}  in ranked, and if he was banned I fell back on my old picks. Because I enjoyed playing him so much, I was able to learn almost every top lane matchup and how certain junglers would typically behave, and in doing so I was able to have fun and climb. \n\nOf course, this is just one example and other comments seem to agree - play who you enjoy! If you are having fun (that's the point of the game) then you will be more willing to play more and improve your skill.\n\nTl:dr, Find a champ you love to play learn the game by playing them.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Really Bad","date":"2018-02-20T12:05:27.077+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"The secret is simply to have fun with it! I never left bronze 5 until I started playing champions that I liked. \n\nFor me, it was ADCs and mid lane mages, namely {{champion:99}}, {{champion:81}}  and {{champion:67}}. Experiment with different styles of champion and find the one you enjoy playing most, because at the end of the day the game is about having fun and the more you enjoy each game, the more you'll be able to take back from it. \n\nPeople who are meta slaves tend to stagnate in their ranks as they do not practise their champion enough and instead expect them to be 'op enough' to get them free wins - over time I found that I began to learn the ins and outs of other champions by playing even only a single champion at a time, and learning other champions' kits through counter-play. \n\nIt's a fast and brutal learning curve to start getting good at LoL, but you can do it if you really want to. The more you play, the more the game will make sense. This has benefits and downsides. Good luck!","replies":[]},{"poster":"Project Xayah","date":"2018-02-20T12:26:20.146+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'm just going to say that anyone who tells you to play meta because \"it's what works\" is an idiot. Fact is, it doesn't matter if something is the strongest thing in the meta, if *you* can't play it, you're just a detriment to your team. Play what *you* are good with, not what others are good with. Play what *you* find enjoyable, not what others find enjoyable.\n\n> also is it ok to have say 3 champs per role to play?\n\nYou'll probably find that pretty much any player would be very happy to hear that. A lot of players would say they prefer someone who has 3+ good champs on at least 3 different positions, and having the flexibility of 3 champs for each position is just going to give you a better chance of consistently doing well, rather than have a bunch of spectacular and terrible games (hitting both ends of the spectrum but not being consistent).","replies":[]}]}
