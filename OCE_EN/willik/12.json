He seems pretty good to me however I have not played enough games to kno whether he is good to climb for B5 to silver 5. His stun seems pretty good along with his blue card for some sustain, and from what I&rsquo;ve seen a lot of people in bronze don&rsquo;t kno how to play against him? Any tips? And is he what I think he is in bronze. Also is mid lane a good lane to climb?","replies":[{"poster":"Nightjar","date":"2018-01-27T00:22:05.418+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"tf is a hard carry champion, but as a champion in a 1v1 he's rather weak. TF specialises in his roams and for this it is critical to have excellent map awareness and game knowledge. In bronze it's far more likely to see a high mechanical player than a technical one, and so I'd say you might not have the correct experience to get the most out of TF. In counterpicks TF is likely to fare very very badly in lane, and if your opponent decides to pressure you in, you won't be able to use your ult because of the minions crashing into your tower. Also I'd say picking the correct card at a clutch moment can be harder than landing alot of skillshots, and TF is very very very very susceptible to being punished for positioning mistakes since he lacks any form of mobility, is short range and is very squishy.\n\nIf you want a good champion for climbing out of bronze as a midlaner, I'd suggest Ahri, since she's got good roams, high carry potential, decent 1v1 post 6, no especially effective counters, she's got good range and waveclear and she suits just about every teamcomp. Her roaming potential and map pressure are slightly less god tier but you'll likely improve faster with ahri since her kit is a lot less specialised and she's certainly very very useful for climbing. Yes all her abilities are skillshots, but she's a very forgiving champion, with long range she's hard to bully in lane, and screw up your positioning she has movespeed, 3 dashes and a charm (also a skillshot but if you can learn to hold onto it. pointblank charm is very effective), so she can likely get out and resposition.\n\nAhri can also orchestrate dives very well, and can be super effective in any 'deathball aram' games that often occur in bronze with her q's range, ability to hit multiple targets multiple times, and the true damage shred on the return which makes even frontliners sting.\n\nIf your heart is set on TF though, I'd say you'd best watch alot of high elo players and especially focus on how they manage the minion wave and especially how they position in respect to skillshots, engages, and jungle pressure, and when they use their ult, how much leniency they position their ult with (I see so many TFs ult and die because they got too ambitious).","replies":[]},{"poster":"SOOM","date":"2018-01-26T22:52:01.528+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Play anyone anywhere and if you get good enough at them you will climb","replies":[{"poster":"WilliK","date":"2018-01-26T23:44:38.030+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Ok ty for the advice.

Ultimately any champion is good to climb with if you're good enough at them, and it's better to play what you know and what you're comfortable with than something you barely know how to play just because it's a counter.\n\nThat said, TF has distinct strengths, and if you can use them to their utmost, he can be very strong. He's squishy and has fairly short range as mages go, but he has a point and click stun and global vision/positioning which are something really worth playing to. He can be bursty but in this meta he takes quite a while to output his damage in comparison to other mid laners, so that's something to be aware of. Positioning is a big thing with TF for that reason (and his range) so if that's something you struggle with I probably wouldn't recommend him.\n\nUltimately though, a champion you enjoy is one you are going to play better than a champion you hate. You just have to remember that in the end climbing is dependent on your overall skill, not what champion you are playing.","replies":[{"poster":"WilliK","date":"2018-01-26T21:15:48.625+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Ty for the opinion and info I'll take this into mind","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Lord Sesshomaru","date":"2018-01-26T12:04:35.673+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Well he's squishy and immobile, and this is the 1-hit extreme-mobility meta.\n\nTake from that what you will.","replies":[]}]}
