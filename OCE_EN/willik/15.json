I must admit that I was toxic that game but not that toxic. I am now worried that once my ban is up even the smallest thing will get me banned. How many other chances do I have after this ban? Is it 1 more ban then perma or is it perma straight after. I find this ban very strange as I have not been toxic ever and one of the first games I play after months of not playing I get banned straight away. How does the system ban me straight away? Like what happens if i say nothing toxic at all but everyone reports me and I get banned. Thank you for reading this everyone please try and answer my questions I am very stressed and in angry about this as I&#039;ve spent over $140 on the account and a lot of hours and hard work.","replies":[{"poster":"Tele","date":"2017-07-01T09:54:57.065+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey WilliK,\n\nTo directly answer your main question, the **next time you are punished it will be a _permanent ban_**.\n\nI've dealt with many cases on here and the system does seem to be harsher with players who have already been punished, so I would be careful for that. Personally I would recommend you_ /mute all_ at the start of every game, or drag the chat so far to the side of your screen that you can't see it anymore.\n\n__*\n\n>_I find this ban very strange as I have not been toxic ever and one of the first games I play after months of not playing I get banned straight away. How does the system ban me straight away?_\n\n + Yeap, if your toxicity is severe enough you can skip punishment tiers. If you're 100% sure it wasn't that toxic, then it might pay to post it here and let the community take a look at it, but it's likely you're just not aware about how most people view certain types of behaviour.\n&#x2063;\n\n\n>Like what happens if i say nothing toxic at all but everyone reports me and I get banned.\n\n+ Nothing! The system needs to find evidence in your chat logs to ban you. If it finds no evidence of toxic behaviour it won't issue any punishments.\n\nGood luck, and let me know if you need any help reforming! :D","replies":[{"poster":"WilliK","date":"2017-07-01T10:00:12.570+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Ok thank you very much for the feedback, so just to clarify I will definitely get my account back in 14 days, and if I don't say anything at all other than calling positions in game I won't be banned again correct?","replies":[{"poster":"Tele","date":"2017-07-01T10:32:06.628+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yeap, you'll get your account back in 14 days time. And yes it is impossible to be banned for chat toxicity if you don't say anything other than calling positions. \n\nAlso after a while of good behaviour your punishment tier will fall. A good indicator is your honour level. If you're around 4 or 5 honour level, chances are you've fallen quite a few punishment tiers and won't be perma-banned on your next offence anymore.","replies":[{"poster":"WilliK","date":"2017-07-02T12:24:45.343+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"sorry for more questions but apparently sometimes it may say a 14 day suspension but its really a perma ban is this true? people have told me this is true and now i am overall concerned that when i get my account back it will be perma banned or something like that. And has the system changed with being toxic as a friend got a chat restriction before the ban is this still a thing, and how did i skip chat restrictions if i was not that toxic, is there a way to just get a restriction by contacting support? And any advice with reforming? My overall point is that im very very worried to lose my account it means everything to me and i need a extra bit of insurance that it will be playable after the 14days. thank you for reading","replies":[{"poster":"Tele","date":"2017-07-03T00:34:25.031+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"No worries dude, I'm always happy to help :D\n\n> _apparently sometimes it may say a 14 day suspension but its really a perma ban is this true?_\n\n+ I've never heard of that happening ever, so no I would say that is not true. Although you can check right now by trying to log in. When you log-in it will tell you the date your ban ends, if that date is in 14 days or less then you're good.\n\n If you're still paranoid after that, you can head and ask [Riot Support](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/requests/new) themselves what kind of ban is on your account,\n&#x2063;\n\n> _And has the system changed with being toxic as a friend got a chat restriction before the ban is this still a thing_\n\n+ Yeah the usual progression is:\n + First Offense: 10 Game Chat Restriction\n + Second Offense: 25 Game Chat Restriction\n + Third Offense: Two Week Suspension\n + Fourth Offense: Permanent Suspension\n\n However if your behaviour is severe enough you can skip tiers. Usually homophobic slurs catch people \"off-guard\", because the system punishes them harshly as they are the most heavily reported terms.\n&#x2063;\n\n> _how did i skip chat restrictions if i was not that toxic, is there a way to just get a restriction by contacting support?_\n\n + If you really think your behaviour wasn't that bad, I recommend you post your logs here for the community (including Rioters) to judge, or try to take up your case with Riot Support. Riot Support and the Rioters here will be able to reverse your 14 day ban, if they think it was too harsh or incorrectly issued. \n&#x2063;\n\n> _any advice with reforming?_\n\nSince you told me this was your first offence, it seems like you most likely had one game where you got carried away and went too far, but usually you're fairly chill. For these cases I recommend you do the following:\n\n + **Remove chat for a while**\n\n  You can use [my method](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5KOcI404TI) of dragging the client away until it's not visible, or use [this method](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBXovNiQny0). But I can't officially recommend that second method because it interferes with in-game files.\n\n+ **Stop immediately when you're tilting**\n\n We all know the feeling. You loose a game really badly, and suddenly have a really strong need to just get in-game again. This is 100% when it's time to stop and play a different game. Remember in your case all it takes is one stupid tilted comment in chat, and your account could be gone forever. \n\n\n+ **Play more often with non-toxic friends (preferably in call)**\n\n This gives you some out of game accountability. I don't know about you, but it's pretty awkward to have a giant argument in chat and ruin a game with your friend in call. \n\n You're also more likely to insult someone verbally rather than through chat. Saying _\"our jungler is fucking trash dude...\"_ as an off comment to your friend in call won't get you banned. But typing that in chat might land you a perma-ban.\n\nI hope that helps, lemme know if you have anymore questions :D","replies":[{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2017-07-05T08:55:08.881+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"He is likely referring to cases where a game is played after the one that triggers the 14 day ban, which then triggers a permanent suspension.\n\n@WilliK\nThese cases are rare, and are not a case of a 14 day really being a perma, but rather two separate punishments issued for separate offences. It also usually requires both games to be quite bad. The chances of this happening to you are slim, though I won't say impossible. For the vast majority of punishments, the 14 day ban is issued before you can enter another game so it is not a concern.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]}]}
