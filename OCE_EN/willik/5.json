Probably when they revamped the support site (or whenever they done that).\nUsed to be able to share your account with family, just not ranked. One of my older accounts was played by like five other people. One of 'em got it banned, though.\n\nJust told Riot that we were family and they lived in America and they said it was fine as long as it wasn't ranked. :x","replies":[{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2017-02-28T09:26:41.167+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It still is fine, and Riot won't ban that kind of account sharing. If it isn't playing ranked and the *account* isn't toxic/botting/scripting etc etc then it's in no danger.\n\nThe rule exists as an absolute to keep things simple. Because it's a ftp game, the vast majority of people wouldn't bother sharing an account and would just make their own, so really it's aimed at the majority of account sharing cases which fall into the \"problematic\" category. Saying flat out that account sharing is not allowed shuts the door on people that would try to skirt the line. \n\nOf course there will always be those with valid reasons to share an account with family or friends (limited money to spend on the game, limited time so shared to collect champions/runes etc) and Riot has no desire to go after these people.\n\nJust as Riot can technically choose to ban anyone, they can also choose NOT to ban someone even if they have technically broken the ToS, though obviously, they only do such a thing in circumstances like yours (with the exception of the one that got it banned).","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2017-02-28T05:33:42.714+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Sharing with family is something that is still against the ToS, but won't be actioned unless it is causing problems (e.g boosting).","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"BarryButcher","date":"2017-02-27T08:25:52.137+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"thats a lie. they only ban botted accounts. they cant ip ban because you can have people in the same household.
