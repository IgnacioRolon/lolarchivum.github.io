You may get a warning / temp ban. Not really sure what the trigger is.\n\nIf you continue to have issues and leave a shit load of games i guess its possible to work your way through the banning tiers to a perma.","replies":[{"poster":"WilliK","date":"2017-06-29T03:44:05.496+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"ok thank you for the help. so basically if you leave a game here and there it wont harm you?","replies":[{"poster":"Roguestoney","date":"2017-06-29T03:46:06.442+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"As longs as it's not many and now too close together as far as i understand.

Rogue has it fairly accurate, though, since you should *not* receive a perma-ban unless you've already been through the lower tier punishments (5-10-20 minute LPQs, followed by a 14 day ban) and/or in extreme cases (like leaving several consecutive games).\n\nAs far as I'm aware, the Leavebuster system only triggers when you have been DCed/AFK from a given match for 5+ minutes.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}
