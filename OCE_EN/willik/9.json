Worried that if I lose the 3rd one I&rsquo;ll be demoted. Is it 3 losses in a row? Or since I have not won one game since promotion is it more than that. I&rsquo;m now scared to play more games as I don&rsquo;t want to get demoted.","replies":[{"poster":"SOOM","date":"2018-02-12T17:50:22.096+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yeah so I just got promoted to plat 3 and I lost 8 games on 0LP ....
