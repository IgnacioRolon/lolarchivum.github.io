On a massive losing streak (any advice)","subforum":"Gameplay & Strategy","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Hey everyone, as you can tell by the title I&rsquo;m on a massive losing streak. I recently finished my placements where I went 2 wins and 8 losses however playing well most games. After my placements I got placed in B5 and have only won 1 game after my placements and loss the rest. Out of all the games i have not &ldquo;fed&rdquo; as such. Can anyone give me tips on how to win games more frequently  and climb from B5 (elo hell). Feel free to check my op.gg (you probably don&rsquo;t want to tbh it&rsquo;s that full of losses): http://oce.op.gg/summoner/userName=Willik\r\n\r\nTf for reading and hopefully someone can help me by giving advice or queueing with me.","replies":[{"poster":"TheDemonEmperor","date":"2018-01-21T09:22:05.081+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Be active on the map.
