However I don&rsquo;t have much time to play league cause of school and every time I play ranked it&rsquo;s such a slow climb as I usually Win, Win, Loss. I&rsquo;m currently B4 and really want to get to silver or gold in the next month but whenever I play a ranked and see my LP after I start getting depressed and think that I will never climb as I can&rsquo;t play all day. Everyday the thought of getting to silver or gold keeps lingering in my head and will do until I achieve my goal. And since it may be a month or 2 until I get to silver I&rsquo;ll have to deal with it stuck in my mind. Can anyone give me any tips so I get less depressed about league and not have that constant hassle of getting to silver or gold in my head until I achieve it? Or any tips that can help? Also leveling up a Second account as I believe I can get to silver just through placements in that.","replies":[{"poster":"BarryButcher","date":"2018-02-06T22:59:32.548+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"To be frank and honest.\n\nTo get out of Bronze all you need to do is actually use your brain while you are playing.\nMost the bronze people I know, simply don't think while playing or have 0 clue about how champions work.\n\nI would suggest you download and watch your replays in the client. Most people will see mistakes when watching gameplay, but its hard to notice them while actually playing so going back and watching can really help.\n\nThe one big thing i'd say is you need to improve your CSing. averaging less than 5 a minute is bronze level.\n\nSimple steps to getting out of bronze.\n\n* focus on yourself, don't get mad at others (mute is your friend)\n* understand how EVERY champion in the game works\n* learn powerspikes for the champions you play\n* USE YOUR BRAIN. If you get a kill, grab an objective or push a lane, dont back for no reason.\n\nHonestly with you leveling a 2nd account because you want to hit silver because your friend did that in his placements seems more to me like you think you deserve silver and cant get there because of teammates.\nI'd rather you get better and struggle through the climb then look for a quick fix because your mate got lucky.\n\nI will tell you this. Bronze is the easiest rank to climb through. If you can't get out of bronze to silver, you won't make it any further on a new account. You may place silver, but you will drop back to bronze if you don't belong there.\nYou got placed B1 on your account and ended the season B3. If you were a silver level player, you wouldn't have dropped. If your friend truly does suck so much as your other post suggests, then he will be bronze soon enough if he keeps playing.","replies":[{"poster":"WilliK","date":"2018-02-07T02:00:23.501+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I actually have been doing those things I am claiming but not that fast.

I mean I don't know what role yu play but someone like \"solorenektontop\"is a pretty good player to learn from or \"pantsaredragon\" they are kinda boring at times but if you really have a aheart for league they are the best. also my personally and not so popular favourite \"boxerpete\".","replies":[{"poster":"WilliK","date":"2018-02-07T00:04:05.111+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Ok thanks for the advice. I am starting to watch challenger ranked streamers and you tubers and it has helped. I’ve started to stop overthinking everything and focus on playing “my game” when I get in a ranked. I have now climbed from b5 to b4 and slowly climbing. I think after focusing on my gameplay and actually thinking about everything I do has helped me improve.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"QAPLA","date":"2018-02-06T23:13:39.154+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I assume BarryButcher is a FMA reference, if so <3.\n\nI'm unranked since season 2 (never been ranked), and have only played ARAM for about 4 years.\n\nI frequently have games where my team is all plats/diamonds/even occasionally master... and unranked me.\nAm I this level of player?
