I have played at least 10 games after my placement games and have not won a single one. This is either due to having a toxic team that argues and then AFK or does there own thing like farm bot lane while in a team fight, OR having no game sense what so ever and now its getting frustrating. 10 games 0 wins 0 LP. Any suggestions or advice to get to silver and actually win games? Thank you for reading this, if any one wants to help me by being a duo that would be great :) just add me WilliK","replies":[{"poster":"Rich3331","date":"2017-02-09T07:23:20.768+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"i remember when i started playing one year ago\nit taken me bout 2 months to get out of bronze and havent been there since\nclimbed to gold 5 0lp in s6 and currently p4 \n\nthe secret is to hard carrying. that is how u deserve to get out of bronze","replies":[]},{"poster":"Struggle","date":"2017-02-08T00:46:39.417+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Start with focusing on improving your cs.\nAlso think that everything is your own fault and what could you do better","replies":[{"poster":"WilliK","date":"2017-02-08T01:51:58.286+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thanks for the advice just wondering is gold a reasonable goal to get to by the end of this year or will it take longer than a year to get to it","replies":[{"poster":"Roguestoney","date":"2017-02-08T01:53:37.484+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Depends how much you improve.
