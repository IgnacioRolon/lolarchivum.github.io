Just to take note last season I got to my S5 promos and then lost a lot in a row and I&rsquo;ve recently been placed in B5 (yikes) however After a lot of tips and videos I&rsquo;ve started to actually improve my skill in game knowledge I.e (warding, map awareness, when to and when not to do certain things) and started to actually climb (a bit). Keep in mind my goal silver 5. In 2 days I&rsquo;ve got up to my B4 promos but lost them. However I&rsquo;m constantly staying around the 60lp mark. So now that I&rsquo;ve explained everything I&rsquo;ll get to the questions.\r\n\r\n- in bronze do you basically just play and if you are good enough you will climb?\r\n\r\n- I am playing around counter picks, meta champions and high win rate champions based on stats on websites. Is this necessary to do in bronze?\r\n\r\n- I play around 8-12 games a week if I actually start climbing and improving more is getting to silver 5 in 1-2 months a realistic goal?\r\n\r\n- how do I deal with dc&rsquo;s, feeders and teammates that just tilt and give up?\r\n\r\n- I&rsquo;ve been suggested to play ahri to climb as I play mid and top in ranked. Is she a good champion to climb and if not is there any other picks anyone can recommend \r\n\r\nTy for reading this summoners, hopefully my questions can be answered as I am super determined to get to silver or even higher in this season. :)","replies":[{"poster":"WoadKethunt","date":"2018-01-30T11:38:21.832+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> in bronze do you basically just play and if you are good enough you will climb?\n\nyeah pretty much, those players you see who are bronze but claim to be way better, those who say they get shit team mates who hold them back those players usually have shit mechanics and try to play champions that are to hard for them, the usually dont notice they are tilted and playing poorly until they are super tilted\n\n> I am playing around counter picks, meta champions and high win rate champions based on stats on websites. Is this necessary to do in bronze?\n\nimo it isn't necessary in bronze, the most important thing is playing easy champions that you are good on, obviously if a champion is genuinely under-powered its not a good idea. i always recommend playing Morgana mid because you can farm super safe with her w get picks in the midgame with your q help your adc with your w and since its bronze its not really that hard to get solo kills with her.\n\n> I play around 8-12 games a week if I actually start climbing and improving more is getting to silver 5 in 1-2 months a realistic goal?\n\ni think it is a realistic goal 2 months is more than enough time so long as you play smart and dont keep playing if you start to tilt (if tilting is a major problem for you that is)\n\n> how do I deal with dc’s, feeders and teammates that just tilt and give up?\n\nyou report the ones who need it, but if that does happen you just need to keep positive and maybe take a break, also if you play ranked in the middle of the night your more likely to get matched up with tired/stoned/drunk team mates its better to play when you think there will be less of that\n\n> I’ve been suggested to play ahri to climb as I play mid and top in ranked. Is she a good champion to climb and if not is there any other picks anyone can recommend \n\nimo i wouldn't play ahri in ranked not unless your willing to get her to level 6 or 7 in normals first. i dont think shes a bad champion but most of her lanes are skill match ups which unless your jungler camps it mean you have to outplay your opponent  but she is good a snow balling games and great at getting picks, but shes one of the higher skill champs\n\n\neven tho im bronze 1 in flex this season and haven't done my placement games for solo/duo i did get to silver 5 relatively easily last season playing TF and ganking botlane and in season 6 i started playing a tonne of lulu mid towards the middle of the season when the adc was a hyper carry, i also played a lot of eve jungle and would camp my duo.","replies":[{"poster":"WilliK","date":"2018-02-01T09:58:59.931+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Ty very much for the advice!","replies":[]}]}]}
