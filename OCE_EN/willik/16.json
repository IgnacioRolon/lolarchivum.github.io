However I&#039;m getting very mixed opinions. I have all the knowledge now on how to climb however things like champions and who to choose and play to climb are getting in my way. Firstly with champions. I literally can&#039;t find who I want to &quot;main&quot; mid after I switched roles from top months ago. I currently enjoy playing Zoe, kassadin, katarina, twisted fate, Ekko and anivia. As you can see my champion pool is way way too large for someone like me who wants to climb out of bronze. I have recently been recommended Vladimir. Any opionions on him as a champ and for climbing? Or akali? And any advice on how to narrow down my champion pool or certain champions out of my pool that are considered good for &quot;climbing&quot;?","replies":[{"poster":"Socon","date":"2018-02-08T03:27:03.836+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Quickfire tips on getting better at league. Note I said getting better, not CLIMBING.\n\n1. Know what champions do and their cooldowns.\n2. CS better so that you at the very least have 120 at 20 minutes\n3. Do not die, at all, while maintaing your cs.\n4. After every cs, check the mini map for ganks.\n5. Ward regularly and when you're pushed.\n6. Don't overextend or overstay.\n7. Don't solo dive, you will most likely get outplayed or trade a kill making it not worth.\n8. Learn how to itemize, building against their TEAM, not just your lane. A good example Is a game I played on my main account where we had a crit yi, crit cait, and crit gp, the enemy vayne bought a randuins as her last item and with nami's help was actually very hard to kill and carried many fights.\n9. Learn how to macro, this means when to drag, when to baron, when to push, how to push properly, minion wave management, etc. \n10. Learn jungle routes and times, even if you don't play jungle, knowing how junlgers play will allow you to avoid ganks. \n11. Your main goal should always be objectives, if you are going for a kill, think about why you're going for the kill, what objective it will help you get, etc. For example, if you are ahead of your enemy, would it not be smarter to kill them when you know you can push the turret, or kill them and have the jungler defend it? Or, if you're bot lane, think about getting drag, if we fight will our jungler be around to take dragon with us? If we win a team fight here, can we do baron or end the game. or get an inhib?etc. \n\nThat's all off the top of my head.","replies":[{"poster":"Joiksu","date":"2018-02-09T23:18:54.106+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Good tips.

Try to keep it simple. Watch one video on youtube and stick to that until you see change. Don't change your strategies all of the time. Learn more about the game.\nSeriously bronze is basically players that don't work together well as a team. They don't know what champions do, or what winning the game is really about. It should be easy to get out of bronze if **you do** know what these things are. It doesn't even matter what champions you play if you understand the game.\nStart with the basics, ask yourself these questions before the game even begins:\n\n1) Why is there a top laner, a jungler, a mid, and two players in the bot lane?\n2) Do I know what every champions abilities do and what roles that champion has for a team composition? I'm not talking about laning roles either, i'm talking about TEAM ROLES.\n\nIf you cannot answer those questions, you need to figure them out before you play ranked at all. Question #1 is multifaceted.\n\nAs for watching videos, try some guys on youtube, but not the clickbait idiots like NB3, Tyler1 or those entertainers. Go for some guys with learning content, like PantsareDragon, NEACE, Lastshadow, and search for \"escaping bronze\".","replies":[{"poster":"WilliK","date":"2018-02-07T21:36:30.408+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Ok sounds good. I have started to watch you tubers and streamers already and in my opinion I know everything to improve myself I just don’t always utilise the skills I have learnt in game. So once I start doing that and cs’ing much better I think I’ll be good. Just hate how in bronze people want kills more than a free tower or not understanding how much 1 kill can do to the opponent.","replies":[{"poster":"Joiksu","date":"2018-02-08T06:34:02.865+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yes, but do you know the answer to the two questions above? Post below if you think you do :) Remember that 99% of bronze don't know the answer :)","replies":[{"poster":"WilliK","date":"2018-02-08T09:41:03.006+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"well, im not too confident in my answer but ill give it a try and if you could tell me the answers after then that would be good. AD and support start off weak early and slowly become stronger as the game comes on. Their job is to control their lane and also the ad and support are bot lane not top as dragon is closest meaning a faster kill on dragon if the jungler, ad and support are their. Top laner is generally a tank or bruiser and same kinda of concept to snowball or build up and get objectives and help the team. mid laners are AP Casters, Mages, or Assassins for the most part and have great roaming potential considering the are the centre of the map, hence why you dont take tp on mid laners usually cause then can roam fairly quickly. Lastly junglers are are in the jungle as they have no \"lane\" therefore utilise jungle camps to gain xp, gold and levels. Since they are theoretically \"always roaming\" their purpose is to gank and put the opponents behind in their lane. All 5 roles play there specific part in the team usually being ad, mid, jg as the main damage while support and top lane are more for positioning and team fights considering their utility \"support\" and damage and tankiness (top). Hopefully you understood all this and can tell me if im right :)","replies":[{"poster":"Joiksu","date":"2018-02-09T23:14:18.801+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"That's a really good answer. Basically its the most optimal way to gain **experience** while still controlling the major objectives on the map at the time, and having the weak carry marksman scale up.\nLeague is basically a 5 v 5 game, and the current system of roles is merely what is the most common thought process on how to do that. For example if they changed that dragon did not spawn on the bottom side until 20 minutes then you might see 'Australia lanes' where the ad and support would start top, because that's where the Rift Herald spawns beforehand. _Maybe_. Remember the bot lane towers are still the squishiest tower at the moment. It would need to be tested by pro teams if that happened.\n\nThe trouble with bronze is that you see many bronze players roaming for kills, chasing, not farming and simply losing **experience**. And say they are a \"fed\" Pantheon with a 6-2-5 score, they wonder why suddenly the 1-0-2 enemy Ezreal just outplays and outdamages them. It's because they messed around outside of lane doing these silly things and missing out on experience.\n\nVery often (if you go back and check some of your match histories), you will see players on your team and the enemy team that have lowest levels achieved in the game, maybe even equivalent to the enchanter support, or tank support. Those players lost the game for their team. They messed around doing stupid bronze things, and did not level enough, and became weak. They died too much, so that they weren't on the map gaining levels, farm and experience. They tried to make hero plays when hero plays weren't called for. They suicided for the Ocean drake. These sorts of mistakes happen all of the time in bronze.\n\nSo that my friend is how you escape Bronze, in a nutshell. Play top, mid or jungle, gain experience and carry the game. Don't rely on your team, they are monkeys. Make every play with experience in mind. Pick a champion that can push. Twisted fate, Kassadin, Ekko, from your favourite champions can do this. Say you are currently top lane as Kassadin with a Lich Bane built already. You have the option to match the enemy top laner's tp to the bot lane gank. If your bot lane are monkeys, don't bother, just hammer that tower in the top lane and push and gain xp, gold, etc. Very soon your pressure will be insurmountable, and you will create too many problems for Bronze to handle. Your team might rage at you, just mute them, you will not be able to educate a bronze in 20 minutes. You don't have to go 20-0-0, you don't have to kill people. Just push, win, next game. Push, win , next game. Always make plays with your **experience** in mind.\n\nP.S. Use the same strategy to escape silver, gold and platinum also. Gameplay (I mean micro mechanics) will be better, but in terms of macro, they still have no clue how to meet a splitpusher effectively. Watch videos on what splitpushing is and how to do it, if you are having trouble. But with those three champions, if you know how to play them, escaping Bronze will be a piece of cake.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"JasonWazza","date":"2018-02-07T13:04:13.848+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> I currently enjoy playing Zoe, kassadin, katarina, twisted fate, Ekko and anivia.\n\nZoe is banned too often, Katarina is too skill intensive for very little gain (your bronze so just pick something easier.), Twisted Fate is kinda meh in the current meta.\n\nThe other 3 are alright, and can probably cover everything your going to need in lane, with very minor amounts of bans.\n\n>I have recently been recommended Vladimir.\n\nWhile Vlad is good, it requires good CSing scores, which a cursory glance at your OP.GG says otherwise, so probably not a good idea.\n\n>Or akali?\n\nLoses lane early in too many matchups and is better top, and again you have issues CSing, so picking something that loses early and need's CS to get going is probably a bad idea.\n\nSo here is the run down of what you have.\n\nEkko: Assassin, If your going to take Inspiration, take stopwatch and either biscuits or future's market, don't have any of that other shit, or if you want a better version, go sorcery get manaflow band and scorch.
