I have won 1 out of my 2 placement games played in flex queue and plan to win at least 6 more games to hopefully get placed in silver in flex queue to ease the stress on getting to silver in solo/duo. So if anyone would be able to help me carry 8 more games for a fairly easy win please add me. I am a jg, top main and play mid and adc occasionally. Feel free to help me get to silver solo q as well. If someone does help me get to silver i would also happily mystery gift you as it has been a dream to get to and alot of the players that i have on my team have no game sense in this elo :/\r\n\r\nAdd me on OCE: WilliK","replies":[{"poster":"LeagueBased","date":"2017-08-19T14:31:20.593+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Do you have discord","replies":[{"poster":"WilliK","date":"2018-01-20T23:20:11.267+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yeah I got discord, realised ur on NA though","replies":[]}]}]}
