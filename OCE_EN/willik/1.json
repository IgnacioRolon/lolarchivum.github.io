Focus only on playing and getting good at two roles.\n\n2. Have roughly 2-3 champions per role that you are comfortably good with.\n\n3. In case of stupid autofill, make sure you have 1-2 champions for every other role that you KNOW how to play at the very least.\n\n4. To better help you at climbing, look at champion.gg and see which champions have the highest winrate for your two selected roles and try playing them as frequently as you can, it will increase your chances of winning drastically.\n\nThe reason why it's best to try and focus on and master two roles is because the game will be much easier to win when you are against opponents you've faced many times before and know how to play against. Also playing the same two roles all the time means that you will also be playing the same group of champions all the time so your experience on how to play them in certain matchups will be much better.\n\nTake me for example, I've played Top lane for 3 years, so I've pretty much faced EVERY single top lane champion that exists in the game at least 10+ times. My main champions are Darius, Jax, Tryndamere but I also play Renekton, Vlad, and Fiora very frequently. Since I queue up for top as my primary role I pretty much play one of these 6 champions almost 90% of all my games. So I have A LOT of experience on these champions which means not only do I have a lot of knowledge on how to PLAY them, but also how to play them AGAINST every other toplaner, even against some in my own champion pool.\n\nAlso regarding autofill, don't waste your time trying to practise getting really good at a lot of champions in EVERY role, it's seriously not worth the time compared to how frequently you actually get autofilled. Seeing as though you get autofilled 1 in every 10 games, it's not worth the time you could be spending getting good at the roles you play 9 out of every 10 games.","replies":[{"poster":"Nightjar","date":"2018-01-21T01:05:22.714+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"also try playing every champion in your main role \"at least once\". You don't need to master them, but playing a decent game from start to finish really helps you work out what the intentions of the player would be on that champion, see the limits, the weaknesses, the plays, the opportunities they would be looking for, and essentially, how to counter that champion. It really helps to be able to imagine what your opponent is thinking and being able to punish them for it.","replies":[]},{"poster":"WilliK","date":"2018-01-20T23:19:21.913+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Ty for the help and recommendations it means a lot!","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Socon","date":"2018-01-24T10:11:21.643+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Jungle is in my opinion the easiest place to carry from, I would suggest warwick, amumu, evelyn, rammus, DARKIN kayn.
