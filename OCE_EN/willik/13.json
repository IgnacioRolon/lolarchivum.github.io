I was just wondering could they have gotten banned for that and would it be a suspension or a perma ban or if no one reported them would they be banned at all? And would the toxic players have had to have other offenses before they got banned, like would it require several games being toxic.

They could usually be the most upstanding player, but perhaps today was the day that their GF dumped them, or their cat died, or something else that tipped them over the edge, and that, while unpleasant, is hardly deserving of punishment. We all have bad days.\n\nSome people on the other hand are just unpleasant people, and will continue to offend, and these are the people that will end up with bans and restrictions.\n\nThe ban system tries to seperate the people with bad days from the genuine toxic people.","replies":[{"poster":"WilliK","date":"2017-01-06T23:25:10.189+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yeah I completely understand, that makes sense as well. So you can only get perma banned straight away for scripting? Just my friend got perma banned straight away although so it got me thinking can you can perma banned straight away for toxicity or only warnings and if it continues then it's a perma ban. As he was lobbied with friends and they all got perma banned so that got me confused why this happened to him.","replies":[{"poster":"Lord Sesshomaru","date":"2017-01-06T23:30:02.822+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Riot has 0 tolerance with scripting, if _(more like when)_ they detect scrips on your account, your account is doomed.\n\nMy friend used scripts once in a custom game against a friend as a prank, _(he would never use them in a real game)_ and he received a perma ban as well. \nSo there is truly no tolerance for that.\n\nToxicity is different though, i don't believe you can receive a Perma ban instantly from that.","replies":[{"poster":"WilliK","date":"2017-01-06T23:41:25.291+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Ah ok yeah I thought so as well.
