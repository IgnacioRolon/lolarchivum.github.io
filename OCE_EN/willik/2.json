I have definitely been trying to correct my flaws in bronze and improve my overall gameplay (warding, map pressure, wave control, when to and when not to fight and csing).

Problem is the % win rate on those two are based on a very small number of games so it is hard to say whether you just got lucky or carried or you are good with them.\n\nother problem is that for champs where you have more than 10 games played in s7, your win rate was below 50% which means you are unlikely to climb until you get better.","replies":[]},{"poster":"DipperOCE","date":"2018-02-02T12:34:00.572+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You shouldn't be asking for an estimate, you should be asking for advice and looking to improve. I am only mid gold rn going for plat this season but I would offer some of these tips based on your match history:\n\n1. Look up high-elo rune pages, your's seem really inefficient and overall putting you at a disadvantage\n2. Stick to one role, and have a second to fill on. Maybe focus on TF mid and maybe have a backup.\n3. Learn how to CS. As a bronze 5 player you current goal to climb should be somewhere like 60-70 by 10 minutes, 140-150 at 20 minutes. You don't necessarily need this for this elo but it helps a lot.\n4. JasonWazza is correct, you are going to have to accept that logically over a large sample size if your win rate is sub 50, you won't climb. However, you are clearly performing well on TF this season and are slowly climbing on him. And will eventually get 50%.\n5. While bronze players are kind of inexperienced and foolish, their main weakness is they throw their leads, and can't come back from early game losses. Try and learn to exploit these weaknesses.\n6. Bronze players have a tendency to always push mid and never go into the side lanes, kind of just have a stare off with the enemy team. If you are confident you can 5v5, go into the fastest pushing lane and try and force a fight (if you have engages). If you aren't so sure, send your split pusher into a side lane and try and draw pressure. While the nexus is like the king in chess, it doesn't mean you are trying to forcefully get them in check every move, it might be better to get their queen or rooks first (inhibs, side towers, etc) to put a lot of pressure on them.\n\nThere are a few more things I could think of but you are a unique player, you clearly have dedication to climb as you aren't playing much normal or flex games which is good, but you need to get into the mindset of {if you improve: you will climb} look to better yourself each game. Not much to lose in bronze 5 anyway.","replies":[{"poster":"WilliK","date":"2018-02-03T01:06:05.460+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Ty for the advice. I have been watching a lot of high elo gameplay lately and since then I have now entered my B4 promos. I have also gone into custom games just to practice csing and felt like it has helped me. I have also been focusing on warding, map awareness, when to and when not to fight and prioritising objectives rather than kills. My win rate is nearly at 50% now as well.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"LazorGunner","date":"2018-02-01T11:02:49.516+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You're obviously just not carrying hard enough :).
