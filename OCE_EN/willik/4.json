You can choose different evolutionary paths in order to best stalk your prey.\nBut like BarryButcher says, if you get behind... it's very difficult to pull it back.\n\nLee Sin is fun, but his 'epic plays' are always just re-hashes of pro plays, it's hard to feel like you are your own player, you do feel like a pro-wanabe, and as an 'overloaded' champ, people give the credit of your plays to the champion or the pro player who invented the play, and not always to you.\nHe is definitely has a reputation of being a 'dick' champ. Like Yasuo or Riven, people see him in champ select and sigh thinking _\"oh god it's another fuckin lee, you can tell he doesn't play any other champs.\"_\nSo if you do play him, you might be lumped in with that.\n\nGraves is kinda boring in my opinion, he's quirky for sure, cos he has a shotgun and ammo. But theres only so many things you candy with him, he isn't anywhere near as versatile as Kha or Lee, but if you want an easy game and lots of kills, he's your man!\n\nYou will have trouble getting S's with all 3 of these champs however, as they are played to death and so have consistently high KDA ratios. \n\n______\n\nAs for fun champs who are easy to get lvl 7 with.\n\nAurelion Sol and Azir would top my list. _(I'm not bias at all... )_\n\nBoth are hilariously fun.\nSol's play style is unlike anything ever before seen in league, and thanks to his 30+ min long voice over and smooth-as-silk model, you really feel like you are playing a star dragon _(while Lee/Kha/Graves are all older champs with more ugly/clunky voices and models.)_\n\nAzir has so much incredible play-potential it's unreal, _(changing direction mid-dash is a trait shared only by Lee)_ The difference between him and Lee is that people congratulate you for doing well with Azir, and expect it of you when playing Lee.\n\nBoth champions are very difficult, have mega strengths _(but also mega weaknesses)_. and are difficult and underplayed enough that you chan get S's very easily because people don't often do well with them. _(I've gone negative and gotten S's on Azir)_\n\nYorick is another champion who I find it easier to get S's on _(maybe its because he CS's like a beast?)_.\nI also found that Shen offers up S's more easily than most.\n\nGood luck ^^","replies":[{"poster":"Akkordian Zoeve","date":"2017-06-27T05:09:14.108+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Wow, nice detail :) Good work :D\n\n > changing direction mid-dash is a trait shared only by Lee\n\nGragas and Jarven IV can also do this, albeit utilising Flash.","replies":[]},{"poster":"WilliK","date":"2017-06-26T22:18:47.851+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"ty for replying i will consider everything you said !","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Roguestoney","date":"2017-06-26T23:08:38.757+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I enjoy Kha the most.

Graves is similar, but its pricks who main. Kha'zix has a fun ult, is useful, but becomes a nightmare to play behind, though you usually find jerks playing him, but his evolved ult is a load of fun, zooming around the map killing plebs.","replies":[]},{"poster":"BarryButcher","date":"2017-06-26T09:58:19.793+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Fun is 100% Lee Sin. His kit is fun, but be warned, he is not easy and hard to master.\n\nOf the 3, Graves is the easiest. However he is pretty weak atm imo.\n\nKha'zix can be fun if you get fed and start one shotting ADCs but if you fall behind the game becomes such a pain in the ass.","replies":[]}]}
