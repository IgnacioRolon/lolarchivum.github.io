He played all of his placements games (never played ranked before and been playing league for 8months) and he got silver 4. He won 4 and lost 6 and let&rsquo;s just say did not go particularly well. So the reason I&rsquo;m asking this question is that in S7 I got placed in B1 won 6 and lost 4 and played a lot better than he did. So why is it that he got S4? And I got B1? Even though these are seasons apart I belive nothing has changed on how the placements system work therefore asking this question. Kinda fed up how unexperiennced players (look at his match history) get something like silver compared to someone like me who has to spend an extra month to climb to silver from B4. Really pisses me off tbh considering he literally got carried and all I&rsquo;ve been aiming for is S5 and then he gets it without any effort at all.\r\n\r\nNote: sorry for rambling or if this does lot make much sense it&rsquo;s late and just wanted to ask this question so I can get answers when I wake up. O and here is his op.gg","replies":[{"poster":"SOOM","date":"2018-02-06T18:48:29.509+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Cause he won his first games of his provisionals so his mmr was up at the start of that ... likely you lost your first games of your promos","replies":[]},{"poster":"DarkShade918","date":"2018-02-06T23:31:06.846+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"LMAO, on one of my accounts i went 0/10 in provis, and got placed silver 1, with no previous MMR, maybe you're just bad and your friend is better.\n\nMy friend went 5/5 in her provis, and ended up silver 3, with silver 2 MMR, with worse stats than me, in pretty much all games (excluding the one where i literally inted, because heal/ghost jg...)\n\nWhat you get in provis is not the singular impact on your MMR, KDA, Objective Control, Warding (all the other stats you seen in graphs at post game) all impact it, maybe you need to improve in those areas,\n\nif you're playing tanks, self-mitigated, with high dmg taken and low deaths will improve the MMR (a little bit)\nIf you're adc, good kda, decent objective control, high cs\nIf you're support (Tank ~ see above ~), mage/utility, high Crowd control/warding scores\nIf you're mid, same as adc\n\nCan't help with jg, because fuck that role, but i assume high kill participation, baron/drag control would do something\n\nProvis is but one factor (the largest, but no the only) your score counts too, if he has better scores than you, he's gonna get placed higher","replies":[{"poster":"WilliK","date":"2018-02-07T02:17:18.754+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"TBH, I donâ€™t think I am bad.
