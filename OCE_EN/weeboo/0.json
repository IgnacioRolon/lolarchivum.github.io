Kassadin ult, casseopeia ult, there really aren't too many that don't make him busted as hell.\n\nYou see he seems to be balanced around not having use of an ult, which is still ridiculous with his healing, so any ult that he grabs puts him over the threshold, especially if it's any of the ridiculously useful ults, makes him broken as hell.\n\nOn top of this, Riot are nerfing Crit items, probably because of turret plating snowballs not really working the way they intended, and just super feeding the team who dominates the lane instead of just getting rid of the turret plating gold, or reducing it by 75-80% So, now if adcs have a standard lane, and have a relative lane to any other on the map, they are under itemed. AP/caster bot lanes coming back in a hurry I predict. Either that or lethality lanes.\n\nBut as for eve's ult the camo is a passive of her ult, so he should inherit that as well, allowing him to use his double gap close reliably as being undetected, and burst, and finish up with a massive damage jump out.\n\nJust imagine he double gap closes and cc's you, then, as you respond, he uses a shaco ult to avoid the damage you throw out, then get cc'd some more. Not fun.","replies":[{"poster":"weeboo","date":"2019-01-17T01:41:38.331+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"omg how did u even wrote this much XD \nanyways thx","replies":[]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2019-01-13T12:42:27.731+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"1.
