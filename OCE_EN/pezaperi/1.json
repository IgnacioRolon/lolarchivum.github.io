It was... rough at the start, but it was pretty awesome to watch the client grow and even help mould it into what it is today. \n\nSome might disagree (those that do are wrong {{sticker:slayer-jinx-wink}} ), but I believe that the devs have outdone themselves with the new client and both they and Riot should be proud.\n\nHope this helps :)","replies":[]}]}
