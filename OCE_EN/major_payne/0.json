But instead of putting me back in the queue, it hangs on that screen and slowly everyone else connects. I thought that maybe there was a patch, so I quit and then tried to log back in. Click on the Launch button, then it hangs on a black screen for about 5 minutes and this error eventually pops up. http://gyazo.com/e358914211992d3db1a4586ecc99cd9b I have started a repair now, will edit when it finishes.\n\nEDIT* Got to about 1600 files checked and then this popped up http://gyazo.com/4253884ca677dd0471fa234493fe35d8 Client still refuses to open.\n\nEDIT2* Rebooted computer, tried to reopen client and it is still doing the original error.
