I am fully aware I shouldn&#039;t have done this and I am now regretting it. \r\nTowards the end of the game, I felt guilty and apologized but I guess it won&#039;t do enough. My friend reported everyone including me which got me banned for 14 days (nice).\r\n\r\nHaving 14 day ban on my first flame and toxic behavior seemed little unfair but thats just my thoughts, maybe I do deserve it.\r\nI just wanted to share and hear other&#039;s thoughts.\r\nThanks for reading and here&#039;s my chat:\r\nGame 1\r\nAlexDotP: illaoi and fiora bot was fun\r\nAlexDotP: fk that leash\r\nAlexDotP: fuck u blue\r\nAlexDotP: soz\r\nAlexDotP: LOL BS\r\nAlexDotP: mb\r\nAlexDotP: MB*\r\nAlexDotP: wtf\r\nAlexDotP: how\r\nAlexDotP: no u\r\nAlexDotP: LOL\r\nAlexDotP: XDDDDDDDDDD\r\nAlexDotP: sad isnt it\r\nAlexDotP: not saying bs but \r\nAlexDotP: is it bad weather there\r\nAlexDotP: alright\r\nAlexDotP: 5000 ping is fun\r\nAlexDotP: supporting lucian\r\nAlexDotP: LOL\r\nAlexDotP: sulk\r\nAlexDotP: cuz he is one \r\nAlexDotP: lol weak mental gp\r\nAlexDotP: OOOH WEE HE SAID THE CURSEWORDS\r\nAlexDotP: maccas\r\nAlexDotP: gp so bs champ\r\nAlexDotP: sulking much ay\r\nAlexDotP: sulk of the year goes to\r\nAlexDotP: U KID HAHA\r\nAlexDotP: IM GONNA REPORT U \r\nAlexDotP: LOOOOOOL\r\nAlexDotP: all u do is sulk\r\nAlexDotP: u guys are winning but not in life\r\nAlexDotP: 1L to u\r\nAlexDotP: actually a bot\r\nAlexDotP: LOL\r\nAlexDotP: such a vague roast\r\nAlexDotP: talk to me when u have a dad fk boi\r\nAlexDotP: OooOOoooOOoo nICe uLt %%%\r\nAlexDotP: SB\r\nAlexDotP: kids dont have mum and dad cuz u guys sb\r\nAlexDotP: dont cry little girls\r\nAlexDotP: stop whinning gp\r\nAlexDotP: u r kid\r\nAlexDotP: LOL \r\nAlexDotP: im not \r\nAlexDotP: cuz u r whining like a little grill\r\nAlexDotP: LOL R U 12\r\nAlexDotP: GP 12 TELLING ME TO CHANGE MY NAME TO %%% SO ORIGINAL\r\nAlexDotP: HILARIOUS\r\nAlexDotP: gp doing it manually\r\nAlexDotP: lol optic, hes using that flynn technique &quot;pathetic&quot;\r\nAlexDotP: u certainly dont speak one kid\r\nAlexDotP: im not\r\nAlexDotP: u guys r\r\nAlexDotP: and twitch\r\nAlexDotP: alg lucian \r\nAlexDotP: LOL\r\nAlexDotP: HAHA\r\nAlexDotP: HAHA\r\nAlexDotP: u gon take that twitch????\r\nAlexDotP: lol vk\r\nAlexDotP: just enjoy at least if u can\r\nAlexDotP: mute some and build ap\r\nAlexDotP: jks\r\nAlexDotP: give me a fattest yeet\r\nAlexDotP: YEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEETTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTT\r\nAlexDotP: nah not me\r\nAlexDotP: i dont but im tired of being positive every time and decided to join twtich\r\nAlexDotP: soz if i hurt ur sensitive feeeeeeeeeeeelings\r\nAlexDotP: accept my apology if u arent sulking\r\nAlexDotP: :)\r\nAlexDotP: gp\r\nAlexDotP: accept my apologie fella?\r\nAlexDotP: we gucci gp?\r\nAlexDotP: good man\r\nAlexDotP: :)\r\nAlexDotP: fair enough\r\nAlexDotP: lol\r\nAlexDotP: XD\r\nAlexDotP: ayy tf talked\r\nAlexDotP: NEVER SURRENDER\r\nAlexDotP: HAVING THE RIGHT ATTITUDE WINS\r\nAlexDotP: jks this game gg\r\nAlexDotP: but im having fun\r\nAlexDotP: lol\r\nAlexDotP: do u want me to apologize and gucci vk?\r\nAlexDotP: ok vk i sincerly apologieze for what i did are we gucci brah?\r\nAlexDotP: lol thats a quote\r\nAlexDotP: lol","replies":[{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2018-01-07T03:16:45.413+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"So, defs not the kind of chat you wanna play a game with, but some more context helps as well. You mentioned this was your first punishment? Usually only real severe behaviour (hate speech, suicide encouragement etc) gets escalated to 14 day, so unless there is something missing from your log or you've had previous punishments or a significant history of toxicity that never quite got you punished, an immediate 14 day would be strange.\n\nDon't get me wrong though, the chat isn't great, and even if your friend hadn't reported you, someone else on your team more than likely would have.","replies":[{"poster":"AlexDotP","date":"2018-01-07T03:23:51.113+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Not that i remember of getting ban except leaver buster years back, which i dont think i was toxic there either. If there was previously then my mistake.\nYes it isnt great nor did my friends (not bringing him into this nor blaming) but Ill control myself as well as my friend/s to make this community more friendly :)\n\nBut i do sincerely apologize and sorry for that","replies":[{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2018-01-07T03:28:16.686+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Everyone has their bad games, the best advice I can give if you're getting frustrated is to move chat off screen (if you can't just mute a troublemaker) so you aren't tempted. Saying it out loud often helps too. If my adc is being an ass I'll damn well say so but I'll say it irl instead of typing it. Fuelling the fire doesn't help anyone.\n\nThe fact that you seem to be reflecting and recognising you had a uhh..bad game is the ideal scenario here. If you just keep it in mind then you shouldn't run into trouble again.\n\nIf this is the complete log and you've had no previous punishments, then you may have an argument to have your punishment reduced to a chat restriction, but you'd have to go through support for that.\nhttps://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/requests/new","replies":[{"poster":"AlexDotP","date":"2018-01-07T03:32:45.472+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thank you :) \nI did contact the support but I've been told to use the current time/punishment to change my behavior.","replies":[{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2018-01-07T05:43:56.055+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I had a closer look and I suspect this line in particular was why you were escalated instead of just restricted:\nAlexDotP: OooOOoooOOoo nICe uLt %%%\n\nRiot has taken a no tolerance policy on hate speech, slurs and suicide encouragement, and coupling that with the pretty excessive and consistent toxicity you were escalated to a 14 day. Just remember that next punishment is permanent, so you'll have to watch yourself pretty close.","replies":[{"poster":"AlexDotP","date":"2018-01-07T05:52:07.673+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"So that line especially was the reason?

It may have been something the enemy said first, but it doesn't look like it was a quote in the sense of \"you said this\", more that you were throwing it back at them, so basically the intent was still negative. That's what it sounds like anyway.","replies":[{"poster":"AlexDotP","date":"2018-01-07T06:00:22.318+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Sorry for keep on and dragging but was 14 day and permanent necessary? In the game there someone who had toxic behavior, \"gg\" spam binding and so. I didnt report them since i dont have rights to do so and i barely report.\nAgain, im sorry for wasting your time helping me and I really appreciate it","replies":[{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2018-01-07T06:23:23.389+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Mmm if it had just been that line on it's own, or that and some other real minor stuff I'd say no, a 14 day would be way too harsh. Personally I'd see yours as borderline assuming there wasn't any in game shenanigans to go with it, but it's hard to get a feel for the game without having been in it. You typed a lot, which creates a pretty oppressive negative atmosphere, and with a slur on top of that it all just adds up.\n\nDon't have rights to report? Do you mean because you were toxic you felt you shouldn't report someone else for it? You can report anyone you like, if the report is valid it's valid, doesn't matter where it comes from.\n\nAs for the other guy, one players negativity doesn't negate the other player's. It doesn't matter who starts it. It sucks when other people are negative in game, but it doesn't give us a license to be assholes as well.\n\nYou're not wasting my time, I volunteer as an Emissary because I enjoy this stuff (most of the time), and I like helping.","replies":[{"poster":"AlexDotP","date":"2018-01-07T08:01:45.140+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thank you so much this made me feel much better, I won't let this happen again.
