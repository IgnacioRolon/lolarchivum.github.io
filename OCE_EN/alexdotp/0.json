I know this may sound like total noobie and all that other stuff but idk if im tilted or Riot system put me into these teams, i barely win games since last year december and i demoted twice... \r\nSome help would be greatly appreciated :)\r\n;-; awwwwwwwww","replies":[{"poster":"Tele","date":"2016-02-04T06:24:31.586+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"I know it's hard to see understand sometimes, but you are the reason for your tilting. The only common factor in all your games has been yourself.\n\nI'd recommend using [replay.gg](http://www.replay.gg/) to download replays of your games, especially losses, and just look through them. Don't look at other people, look at yourself. Here's some stuff to look for:\n\n1. **Wards placed.**\n How many wards do you place per game? \nAre you buying at least 1 pink ward each game? \nJust before you got ganked, did you have a trinket up? \nAre people avoiding your wards? How can you stop this?\nWhere can you place wards so that they are more effective?\n\n2. **Vision/Awareness**\n Did you notice the teamfight at dragon?\n Did you notice the jungler walked passed a ward when he ganked?\n Did you notice someone rotate to a lane?\n Did you notice your carry/ADC was getting focused hard every fight?\n Was the allied jungler close by?\n\n3. **CS and mechanics**\n How close is the CS in lane, at 5, 10 and 20 minutes?\n Could you have baited to a shroom in that situation?\n Could you have flashed the skillshot to avoid getting ganked?\n Did I forget to use ignite?\n\n4. **Death and mistakes.**\n Why did I die there?\n What can I do to avoid dying like this in the future?\n What can I do to stop my teammates from dying? (Roaming is the answer to that :D)\n Why did I die in this fight? Was I out of position? \n Was it good that they focused me instead of someone else?\n Did I need to protect the ADC in this fight?\n Was I focusing the wrong person? Was it possible to focus the correct person safely?\n5. **Know your enemy.**\n  What did the enemies do that we didn't?\n Did my laner counter-pick me?\n Did my laner TP/Roam more?\n Did my laner ward more for ganks?\n Did they capitalize objectives better?\n Did they have more wards? Where were they?\n\nI could go on forever, and at a pro-level these questions can get endless. But I think this is probably enough to get gold or platinum.\n\nI know it's really boring to review your games sometimes, but you'll improve so slowly if you don't. Take notes and think about what's happening. \n\n_**If you don't analyse your games you'll keep making the same mistakes and never improve. **_\n\nP.S These questions aren't limited to post-game analysis, use them in-game too when you can!","replies":[{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2016-02-04T08:00:31.238+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Vision/Awareness is so underrated.

I would recommend you to play only one/two champion/role until you start winning constantly. Never change your champion/role for any reason. This way you can climb and comeback to winning streak. As an example, you can play Annie or Lulu as Support/Mid/Top. Choose what champion you would like to play and just play until you win constantly.","replies":[]},{"poster":"chezwickcheese","date":"2016-02-05T01:19:47.407+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"At the moment its a complete gamble whether you get a good team or one with trolls and afkers.

As far as your team goes, the best way to deal with trolls or toxicity s to simply not engage it, mute and move on and report in post game. For AFKs or feeders all you can do is accept and move on, if that means surrendering and taking a loss that's unfortunately how it has to be.\n\nThe only thing you have total control over in your games is you, so if you want to get better, the best way is to look at how/what you are playing and how you could do it better. If you are picking champions that are 'strong' instead of what you can play well then you can fix that. If your builds are too cemented and you aren't varying them according to team comps then you can fix that. If there is a better way to do a certain combo you can fix that. These are the kind of things you can look at. Warding, cs, playstyle, builds, playing to the comps, it's all stuff you can look at to get better at the game.\n\nIn the end though one of the most valuable things you can have is a positive attitude. If you let the trolls or the AFKs really get to you then you're going to play a worse game yourself and do worse overall.\n\nEDIT: and I just say Telecaster's response which is pretty similar, he brings up a lot of good stuff in more detail than I do so definitely give that one a good read.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Lord Kylar Alice","date":"2016-02-04T07:50:26.129+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Focus on yourself, not your teams. For starters you need to fix your farming. Averaging 100 cs/game as laners and even less on junglers when the games are going for at least 20 minutes, usually longer. 100 cs/10mins is ideal but aim for 70 by 10 mins, 150 by 20 mins, 250 by 30 etc.","replies":[]}]}
