I find her really unbalanced and op, she dont need just nerf, she needs rework. What do you guys think","replies":[{"poster":"noogai","date":"2015-12-07T04:47:34.692+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"zzz. She doesn't need reworking, she doesn't even need a nerf. She is literally one of the best champs released lately in terms of balance. As a Juggernaut, she is designed to deal plenty of damage. Her core strengths are AoE damage, Teamfight potential and self healing/tankiness. There's nothing she needs removed or changed in her kit to fix her, you need to learn to outplay her.","replies":[{"poster":"JasonWazza","date":"2015-12-07T05:06:16.998+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"No she does need a slight nerf, her tentacle slamming numbers need to go down slightly (either in healing or in damage, not both) and she'd probably be balanced then.","replies":[{"poster":"noogai","date":"2015-12-07T05:51:30.109+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Riot have stated they feel she's at fine levels, and that maybe the base damages on the Q need to go down slightly, but other than that I believe she's perfectly fine.\n\nOutplay the tentacles, counterpick her with a pick champ like Blitz or Thresh or Nautilus and 5v1 her so she's out of the fight and can't ult to chew up your team with tentacles, and you're fine.\n\nBut of course if you try and stand still and auto-attack duel her, you'll lose.","replies":[{"poster":"JasonWazza","date":"2015-12-07T06:18:07.760+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":">Riot have stated they feel she's at fine levels, and that maybe the base damages on the Q need to go down slightly\n\nThis is basically what i said, except i mentioned that the healing drop could be the other way to go about it.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Essembie","date":"2015-12-07T06:26:49.960+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Which top is best to counter her?","replies":[{"poster":"noogai","date":"2015-12-07T06:33:18.296+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"A good one is Nasus, as your lifesteal is more or less equal to her %healing. Darius is a great one as well, he can brawl just as well as she can.\n\nJax is excellent as well, but only because jax is excellent against most top laners. Irelia will continue to beat up every god damn top laner if she gets a tiny advantage, and a very interesting pick is Elise top, as you can stun her, blow your whole combo and use your Rappel to escape her R, E, W and Q at any point in a fight.\n\nMajority of top lane champs can fight her, it's all about positioning.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"V10lence","date":"2015-12-09T01:22:34.845+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I just had my first game of ARAM against Illaoi and it was awful. Her tentacles spawned at the base of friendly towers and behind friendly towers. It was a total wipe and the game was over in 16 mins we didn't even get to see the enemy tower let alone do any damage to it. I really hope Riot does something about this, mind you I'm not optimistic because like everyone always says \"It's just ARAM\".","replies":[]},{"poster":"AlexDotP","date":"2015-12-07T08:01:27.359+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I dont know about other lanes but how about bot lane illaoi? support, adc Illaoi? Thats only Illaoi i versed in lane and we lost like real hard. I just really dont like her E that grabs you and when u go out it spawns tentacle near you where ever you are and thats really annoying","replies":[]}]}
