Lissandra","subforum":"Help & Support (OCE)","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I just played a normal game as Lissandra and fell victim to a &#039;law-defying&#039; stunt from the enemy Caitlyn;\r\n\r\nUpon finding an out of position Caitlyn traversing through river I immediately engaged on her, and once I felt she was low enough to die from an ult + Q combo, I decided to do so, however Caitlyn auto attacked me through my ultimate and killed me instead.\r\n\r\nI know it&#039;s entirely possible for certain actions to be made in the wind-up of, and even the very premature animation stages of Lissandra&#039;s ultimate, but when Caitlyn&#039;s auto attack went through, it was what I&#039;d estimate to be .5 seconds into the stun. I personally feel I have sufficient Lissandra experience to know for certain when a champion is locked down, but to vanquish any doubt in a readers mind; Caitlyn was completely incased in ice, the &quot;ice tomb&quot; effect had just begun and then she shot at me.\r\n\r\nWhat makes this more curious, and I personally think it&#039;s the reason why this bug exists; is that the auto attack that went through was also a headshot proc, and I feel given the recent changes to her headshot, it makes sense that was the reasoning behind it.\r\n\r\nThis isn&#039;t a major bug by any means, but hopefully it&#039;s a quickfix that can be thrown into the next patch!","replies":[{"poster":"Deep Terror Nami","date":"2016-02-06T05:54:55.872+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Kalista had a bug where she'd keep auto-attacking while disabled, so this doesn't sound that farfetched.
