What you're describing is the low priority queue penalty hand to you by the Leaverbuster. It detects you as \"away\" if you haven't sent a command to your champion in a game for five consecutive minutes.\n\nYour punishment won't be lifted, and only playing more games (without leaving them, of course) will remove it.
