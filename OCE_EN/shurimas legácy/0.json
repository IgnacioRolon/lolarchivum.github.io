The new Rengar doesn&#039;t have that same feeling like the old Rengar did, the animation and builds on the old Rengar were so much better. Now he is more of a bruiser and a lot of people who played him have quit. there was nothing wrong with old Rengar, yes! he was very broken, but instead of giving him a crappy rework, work around the stats on his abilities. I know i&#039;m just 1 person but i think a lot of people agree, which is why i think riot should hold a pole for the old Rengar to come back but with **major nerfs**.  (I&#039;m not a very good writer)\r\n\r\nPlease don&#039;t hate i&#039;m just simply expressing my thought and so many others.\r\nI&#039;m open to discussion.","replies":[{"poster":"SOOM","date":"2017-10-25T23:19:04.033+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I don't like getting one shot with no counter play no thanks :)","replies":[{"poster":"Shurimas Legácy","date":"2017-10-26T07:42:58.438+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Well maybe if u read the post i said with heavy nerfs.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Wuks","date":"2017-10-25T08:12:08.226+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I think Riot's aware that Rengar's in a sub-par state at the moment, and they have indicated intentions to review how they can work to change that:\n\n> Touching on Rengar since he gets some questions and we mentioned him much for a bit. We don't have any immediate balance plans for Rengar, we're not happy with his state long term though, which will assumedly mean some larger work at some point (might be one of the projects taken on after LB and Azir, might not, still assessing options there). As with LB he's been a challenging champion historically, offering some really high moments but never being in a great spot counterplay/balanceability wise.\n\nhttps://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/developer-corner/9KovwJ7c-quick-gameplay-thoughts-august-4\n\nRepertoir also gave his thoughts in a comprehensive comment about his thought on Rengar, as well as his thoughts on the potential changes:\n\nhttps://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/gameplay-balance/ENUEELfG-megathread-lets-discuss-rengar?comment=0070\n\nHopefully that alleviates some of your concerns.","replies":[]}]}
