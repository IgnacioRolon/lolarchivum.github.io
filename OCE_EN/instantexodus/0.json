But I was trying to be good after that. I was being politr and not raging and team mates until I hop in a game aND all is going well enemy team are arguing about a troll ap nasus jg. And I say it happens to everyone they flame me for this. We are winning like 7-0 kills and then our mid laner roams bot and steals 5 cs instantly triggering our add Draven leaving him to go afk. This tilTed me and all I said was wow we need you. He came back but then just started feeding to the end of the game. I said in all chat sigh feeding afk Draven ruining my games or something like that. The enemy team were laughing calling me retarded and flaming me for saying this. Game ends I report Draven for afk. To find out he&#039;s duod with the poppy top lane and they both report me and so does 2 of the enemy team if I&#039;m not mistaken. I find this absolutely horrible 12 year Old kids afking and int and they get nothing done to them. But I ask them to stop and state they are afk and I get the bans for it. I&#039;ve played this game for 2 years and spent hundreds of dollars this toxicity has been happening for the past year and it&#039;s getting worse. Riot doesn&#039;t care if someone is sitting in base doing nothing. Because automatic reports can&#039;t see anything wrong with that. I sent a ticket explaining but ik I&#039;m not gonna get unban Ned.  It&#039;s how life is. Always pick on the innocent person.","replies":[]}
