Season 5, i was SIlver V, 100lp 4 game win streak. Then season 6 hits, i go 8/2 and im demoted down to bronze 1? Check my lolking stats, but, I had more kills than deaths in every one of those wins, and im a support main. My mastery was above B+ in almost every game. I just don&#039;t understand how this works? In season 3 I placed in bronze. In season 4 i fought out of bronze to silver. In season 5 i got demoted to bronze, and fought back to silver. Now im demoted back down to bronze for NO REASON!?!?! Im sick of fighting my way out of bronze I elo HELL. This has got to be a mistake right? Riot? PLEASE!?!?! I BEG OF YOU... i thought the point was, if you go 5/5 you stay where you are. If you do worse or better, you get demoted or promoted accordingly... HELP!?!?!","replies":[{"poster":"RonyStark","date":"2016-01-21T04:44:26.230+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"@CL:\n\nI was at Silver 2 last season.

This is to probably stop luckers getting good divisions off placements. If you're any good of a player you will easily climb out. If you can't then you obviously don't belong in silver.","replies":[{"poster":"Olee","date":"2016-01-21T19:30:16.188+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"100000000% this. Anyone who complains about being placed in Bronze when they were Silver last year, probably doesn't deserve Silver. I went from Bronze to Silver three times last year with ease.","replies":[{"poster":"Lord Sesshomaru","date":"2016-01-21T21:18:30.317+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"Not being mean, just pointing out the flaw in your statement,\nyou say it was easy getting to silver 3 times. what completely negates that statement was that you actually needed to get to silver 3 times.","replies":[{"poster":"Olee","date":"2016-01-21T22:30:31.160+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Oh no no dude, I get that.
