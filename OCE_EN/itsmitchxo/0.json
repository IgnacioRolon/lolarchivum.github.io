So i'd suggest Zac/maokai (they are good for early ganks and also they have strong teamfight/carry protection) and for mid play annie, she is easy to learn and you want to focus on nothing but csing for a while, until you can get like 70 + at 10 mins. (as you're bronze you can hard carry games just by cs lead) Always remember as a mid laner 13 cs is = to 1 kill, so unless a kill gets you a dragon/tower/baron etc it's probably more worth it to farm, unless the kill is free","replies":[{"poster":"LevvyLeviticus","date":"2016-11-30T20:53:42.308+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"That second guy you suggested to watch is freaking creepy","replies":[{"poster":"Cakemeisting","date":"2016-12-01T02:39:51.072+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"He's the best one of the two.
