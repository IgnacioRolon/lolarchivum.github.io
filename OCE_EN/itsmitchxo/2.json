I personally think it&#039;s the worst idea riot has ever had. I queue for whatever role I&#039;m good at yet I always find myself playing support and getting blamed for the team&#039;s loss. Just wanting to know thoughts.","replies":[{"poster":"LetsTwitch","date":"2016-09-14T09:25:20.126+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I dont care about long queue times to get what I want to play. I'm playing the game **competitively**, I don't want to be basically forced into a loss because there arent enough people playing sup to meet the demand so Riot thinks I can do it when I don't want to.\n\nIt's less that I cant play supp more that here I am playing adc because I'm good at it and win games with it but then Riot decides to ruin my **competitive** experience by not letting me play it which is pretty frustrating and how am I supposed to play an unfamiliar role that I dont want/like where I serve another stranger and win.\n\nIts competitive play, not for fucking around\n\nP.S: Does anyone else get it on all of the time, it is only off for me when I have recently autofilled no matter when I play E.G Sunday midday-afternoon and autofill is on","replies":[]},{"poster":"QAPLA","date":"2016-09-11T05:56:32.829+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Keep in mind that roles and team structure are largely player defined, not by Riot.\nThere is nothing stopping a team from going 5 ADC's etc.\n\nVery few people want to play support, because the support role is often considered boring or \"not fun\". You get yelled at for farming, yelled at for taking a kill or two (even if you earned it), yelled at for not spending the measly amount of gold you do get entirely on wards, yelled at if the ADC gets _himself_ killed, etc. What incentive is there to play support?\n\nThis is Riot's doing, they are all about developing hyper carry type champs, or beefy unkillable tops/junglers, not making the support role more enjoyable so that players are encouraged to volunteer for it.\nThe whole support thing needs to be readdressed, people play games for recreation (mostly), not to be the bitch for the other 4 team members.\n\nRiot's approach to the problem has been \"no one wants to play support, so we'll implement a system that forces them to\" rather than \"no one wants to play support, so we'll make support more enjoyable to play\".\nIt's a classic case of treating the symptoms rather than the cause, and this seldom, if ever, works.","replies":[{"poster":"ItsMitchxo","date":"2016-09-11T11:06:23.764+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"This is a very mature response instead of getting the casual L2 support. This is also the case, support isn't the most fun role in the world to play and if they implemented ways of making support more interesting to play and have more fun playing that people might actually play support. Thanks for this response I greatly appreciate the feedback.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Damocracy","date":"2016-09-14T12:03:26.945+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Spot on.
