Shyvana, Udyr, Yi and some other champions too, so please Riot read this and Strongly consider brining devourer back please.","replies":[{"poster":"dragon poo","date":"2016-12-08T06:15:04.838+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"they took out devourer because it was unhealthy for the game for the jungler just to solo farm for 30 minutes then kill people in 3 autos while building full tank.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Nightjar","date":"2016-12-08T06:14:43.944+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"devourer wasn't a great item in terms of gameplay since it encouraged junglers to afk farm which forced the game into having 3 types of junglers, the oppressive early game junglers, the cc tank junglers and the powerfarm and then 1v5 junglers.\n\nThis type of trifecta of jungler archtypes makes it really hard to balance the game and has been removed for much the same reason strength of the ages was removed (we still have the less than exciting bond of stone though). I feel riot does need to look into balancing champions like master yi and udyr (not shyvanna because right now she's super tanky and has ridiculous dps) since they don't seem all that viable at the moment but I don't think riot should allow true powerfarm junglers to return.\n\nYes it's cool being able to clear camps really easy and quickly but it's not all the engaging and teamplay focused when your master yi comes out of the jungle after 25min of abandoning his laners to basically a 4v5 and then either managing to 1v5 with his sated devourer and full build or the game being so lost after 25min without a jungler that he complains and asks the enemy team to report his team for feeding when realistically he should have been helping his team. I'm not saying you do this, but sated devourer does encourage this kind of selfish gameplay. I mean I wouldn't mind if sated devourer hadn't been removed if they had encouraged more champion kills than just farming, but now that rageblade has the old devourer phantomhit passive, sated devourer won't be returning since having 2 phantom hit items that could be stacked would be very unhealthy.","replies":[{"poster":"Razzawood","date":"2016-12-08T06:55:59.249+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thank you for your comment but for devourer to come back i meant to say that when they release it they should make it that it only takes 10 stacks and its not too strong maybe and maybe they could third everything because i really would like this item back.","replies":[]}]}]}
