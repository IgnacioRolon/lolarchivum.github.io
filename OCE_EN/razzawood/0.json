And if there was ever a pay option to avoid this, I'd 100% quit this game. \n\nOther options include, asking your teammates to switch if you can only play certain roles, if you get autofill with support playing soraka, or uninstalling.\n\nAlso a note, if you ask to switch, some people like me will begrudgingly switch roles with you, but if you threaten to feed if you don't get your role like a angry little 10 year old, you're going to get reported for being an asshat.","replies":[]},{"poster":"BarryButcher","date":"2016-12-21T09:16:27.271+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"If you get autofilled or play Support you get a 3 game immunity.

People who dont want to fill will face longer queue times, potentially never finding a game and might reconsider. \nAnyone who refuses to play the role they are filled to gets reported and a system is implemented to determine if they trolled by trying to bulldoze their way into mid or whatever role and if they feed when filled the system takes it very seriously. For instance if someone dies to mid turret before minions have even met the first time when they were filled to support that should be a very heavy indicator towards feeding.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Krispy Migraine","date":"2016-12-23T19:59:50.806+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Can't they just do a thing where you select which role you want to be in before the game then in the queue you can't join games where someone else wants to do your role eg I pick jungle then potato picks jungle too.
