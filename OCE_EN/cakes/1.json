After the game ends it seems like you sit at a loading screen for a good 20 seconds and no it isn&#039;t my computer and no I will not list my computer and all the info like everyone always asks. \r\n\r\nJust wondering if you could make it so in the settings we can tick a box for if we want to see the end game screen or not. Sometimes I want to play games back to back with no wait. I guess a lot of people do. So the option to Opt Out of the end game screen in the client would be great. For example when you finish a game and exit, it will take you straight to your lobby to pick the next game. That would be much appreciated.
