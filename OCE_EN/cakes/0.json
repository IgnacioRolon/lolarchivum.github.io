I have tried 4 times to relog and it keeps coming up with this. I bet you will punish my account for not going into game when you can clearly see its not me. My internet is fine as I can use it to write this post and to relog 4 times into the client but when going into the actual game it comes up with the server connection error. What is going on? Can you let me play your game?\r\n\r\nSort this out ASAP!!!!!!!!!!!!!","replies":[]}
