No, I&#039;m not proud of it.) that there is so much wrong with this game. Sadly since 2016 this game hasn&#039;t been too enjoyable, and has really fallen apart as of late. \n\nWith the number of bugs increasing and going unpatched (melee auto attacks going through even after the flash is out of range, {{champion:432}}  flying super high whenever he is knocked up when attempting to go into his E, {{champion:154}} still buggy as ever during his E just to name a few) I think this game is becoming overly unreliable, and I&#039;ve seen whole channels disappear for the same reason. What should have been fixed on release of specific things is not even being looked at. Even Vandiril, a fan of the game seems to be finding more bugs than the Riot team, which is simply stupid, given that this company is a multi-million dollar company who can surely afford a few more bug fixers.\n\nDon&#039;t get me wrong, a lot of the things this game has done has been truly innovative, with skins that look amazing as an example (Lookin at you, Star Guardian group), but there is so much more that needs to be fixed. Honor, for example. It takes at least 40-50 games to get out of the lock in the dishonorable stage, and at least another 200 to reach the first checkpoint. That means to get back to Honor level 2, I&#039;d need to play AT LEAST 1200 games without so much as a bad word. Which, I&#039;m sorry, but that&#039;s just dumb. Extending the level 2 honor into Clash as well - also dumb. If you&#039;re gonna do that, might as well say &quot;hey, we know that we could leech some extra rp off this dude but who cares, because we don&#039;t&quot;. Not to mention your report system is still useless, and implementing an auto-pickup of the word &quot;kys&quot; is certainly one way of doing it, but there have been so many worse insults than that I had to quit league for a whole month to escape the toxicity.\n\nNow onto some actual fun suggestions. Having map accents as a purchaseable item would make the game feel far more personalised and enjoyable i.e. having the Bilgewater ARAM map as a purchaseable accent for 1350RP. This would make the game feel far more fun since I can enjoy the game for more than beating another team. Having XP boosts on Normal team&#039;s with 2+ members (like you USED TO) would also be fun.\n\nThis is a multi-million dollar company. Do something about the game instead of churning out stuff to distract people from the things wrong with it.\n\nOtherwise I&#039;ll just give this account away, uninstall the game and carry on with something more fun. Like Candy Crush.\n\nP.S Making the \"get a bonus rare skin for purchasing every other skin\" available during the IP changeover ONLY made me want to rage quit.","replies":[{"poster":"Socon","date":"2018-05-29T14:12:00.313+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"1. No, you're not going to give your account away, you spent too much money on it. They also don't give a shit what you do with it as long as they don't catch you selling it.\n2. Why would you advocate to buy a map they're giving us for free? They're a billion-dollar company, not multi-million. They should have given us an improved aram map long ago. People have been asking for alternative maps since season 2, it's not going to happen now. \n3. The major problem with league are the coders and balance team, everyone knows this, everyone has complained, riot knows the problem far better than anyone of us does. So you can expect that they're doing things for their own reasons, whether it be to save money, or maybe its because their new staff can't handle all the code that's in the game.\n4. Yes the skins are pretty even though they get lazy sometimes and we have to riot (pun intended) to get them to improve the quality of the to the expected standard.\n5. There are lots of things riot has done as short time bonuses, you're not the only one, I'm still waiting for double ip weekend to come back.\n6. Clash is bullshit and everyone with half a brain or has been around long enough knows its bullshit, they took away ranked 5v5's when they introduced dynamic que and gave it back to us in a packaged system we have to pay for.","replies":[{"poster":"PerkyNipNops","date":"2018-05-31T01:01:19.604+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"1. I actually plan on doing a charity stream where I'll be raising money and a random draw will have the account. So it's definitely happening if shit doesn't change.\n2. I'm saying they should have it as a personalised accent, not for everyone. e.g I might have star guardian accent, you might have arcade.\n3. Like you said, it's a billion dollar company. the people expect better from this.\n4, 5 & 6. At least we can agree on this.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Smoke Kush","date":"2018-05-29T22:21:13.642+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":3,"body":"Riot should spend lest time diversity hiring and hire real staff. Maybe Tencent should spend less time trying to bring money in and fix their game. Lets be real, League of Legends has been a steaming pile of shit ever since Tencent took over. I got addicted to the wrong game, no communication between the Players and Riot staff. They don't release what we want, but what they want. Riot retard games, honestly fuck this game.","replies":[]}]}
