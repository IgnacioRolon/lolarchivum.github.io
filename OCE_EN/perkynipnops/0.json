Even though Riot has been talking about lowering toxicity with their reporting system, I question as to whether the people that I report actually end up getting punished for it.\r\n\r\nI have submitted countless reports for bad player behaviour, and I have not had a single one come back to me saying that the player was actually punished for it. I have spent well over $1000 on this game, buying skins and champions not only for myself but also my friends, both offline and those that I have made through this game, and whilst I have had a lot of people being happy with games, it is a select few that completely ruins the experience and ends up making me not want to play ranked at all. Last year I ended up a respectable Silver 5, and this year, due to both player toxicity and bad matchmaking I have ended up in Bronze 4. Let me be clear, I&#039;m not putting the blame on everyone else, I myself have made a few bad plays, I admit. However, what makes the ranked games (and the normal games too, however it is more prevalent in ranked) awful is the moment you give first blood there are always 1 or 2 people that end up saying &quot;Surrender at 20&quot; or &quot;OMG how could you noob, you&#039;ve cost us the game&quot; etc. \r\n\r\nI feel that Riot is, while doing a great job with champion creations and map changes, aren&#039;t exactly focusing on what makes this game... bad. Having new champions and items are fun and all, and it does improve player experience, but having those one or two players that are so salty that they just make you feel like going AFK (except no-one does since the Leaverbuster system is incredibly unfair) really ruins my experience. Case in point, last night I had a ranked game, queuing with two of my best friends. Went top lane {{champion:106}}  against {{champion:122}} , ended up not having a great start, going 1/3 in the first 15. Our ADC, an {{champion:81}} , was so toxic that both me and my friends almost ended up just going AFK so we could just play a different game. We ended up pushing past the toxicity and ending victorious, but that&#039;s beside the point. Having a teammate that can be so toxic can be more of a gamechanger than feeding a few kills. Simply because the psychology of being insulted in this way can really put you off game, and the more they insult you, the more you just don&#039;t want to play. Having an ignore button is okay, but let&#039;s face it, it&#039;s just not an appropriate way of fixing the issue. League requires constant communication, and putting an ignore button in ruins the chances of securing a victory, since people in low ELO&#039;s like Bronze and Silver almost never ping (and if you do ping, I love you).\r\n\r\nAs for Leaverbuster, I don&#039;t think it&#039;s a fair system. I have had the displeasure of being dc&#039;d for a long time due to a poor internet connection, and, due to no fault of my own, I get placed on an AFK queue, having to wait 30 minutes for 5 games as a punishment to something I cannot fix. It really needs to be looked at, or at least have a chance in which people can give a reason as to why they went AFK. It can be looked at the same way our Tribunals look at it. Being AFK because of a bug or bad internet is no reason for people to be punished. People who are toxic or just AFK for no reason deserve to be punished.\r\n\r\nIn all, I just want this to be looked into. This has become practically the only game I ever play, giving me the confidence to create my own YouTube channel, and expand into new friendships. I have spent well over $1000 as I said and played over 2400 games over the course of a year and two months. I know this game can be soooo much better if this was fixed up. The game already is pretty much perfect.","replies":[{"poster":"Knuuckles","date":"2016-05-14T05:55:37.434+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Longest post oce","replies":[{"poster":"PerkyNipNops","date":"2016-05-14T07:06:07.449+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It's a long post because I'm sick and tired of this not being properly addressed.

Hell with it, its way under value, Got the solution right here, labeled as NEW: These new passives work on total armor “a lot more value!” but due to the nature of armor and magic resist having a .5 sec register rate, if people were to spam it enough it would give them way too much armor/magic resist. The cost of this item has gone from 1625 to 1825, making it an equal gold for stats value with less than a 100 difference once more.\n>  \n> Elder’s Crucifix (Whoa, don't won’t to get on the wrong side of that guy)\n> 30 ability power \n> Unique Passive – Elder Knowledge: Every 3rd basic spell cast adds a stack of Elder’s Blessing, at 3 stacks, Elder’s Blessing becomes available\n> Unique Passive – Elder’s Blessing: The next basic spell has 20% increased effects, has a ~~15-second cooldown after consuming the buff ~~25-second cooldown after consuming the buff (maybe that's too harsh, it does take years to ready)\n\n> “has a 15-second cooldown after consuming the buff”\n\n> Because that would be abused so hard with ezreal or cass with their spam stacking if you understand what I'm saying.

Currently I am unsure as to whether I should put in the effort to take the game seriously enough to put myself through the highly unenjoyable gauntlet of bronze ranks which doesn't seem to balance player skill at all. I spend 80 or more % of my ranked games realising we have no chance of winning within the first 15 minutes based just on player behaviour. It is too easy to see when players neglect to secure towers in lane over inconsequential scores like kills and assists. So many games I have 'lost' due to negative KD ratings, but I've won in the end because I secure TOWERS and INHIBITORS. On a point raised by Perky, I also have considered taking up my own luck on starting a twitch or youtube channel, especially since at any point in the near future I will have access to the NBN scheme. For those that will look to discredit me, in my first season of ranked I was placed into bronze 1 with my last game of promos I was placed into a game with all GOLD players. I swear Riot musta thought I was a smurf or some crazy sh** (I have not had to deal with that crazy amount of abuse either thank god - I was a ww jungle and my entire team lost lanes in under 6 minutes). What I also cant believe is the lack of general understanding about critical tactics on summoner's rift. Now most people will give me a puzzled look, but what I refer to is securing objectives. Nearly no one I play with ever speaks about the significance of each tower and the TYPE of map control it gives. For example, the most important tower on the map is the first tower in middle lane, it is the stalwart guard that allows a jungler to relatively safely farm in early game, a mid laner is also present should a gutsy enemy jungler attempt to invade (like anyone in bronze is that aware though...) and should that enemy mid tower go down, its the best thing that could happen for a jungler in terms of MAP CONTROL. Without a strong composition and strong cohesion the first mid tower lost is a strong indicator of who will probably win - especially if second tower is pushed in. I could then move onto explaining rotations but it would either fall on deaf ears or scoffed at by players who already know.\n\nAll in all I would like to see a better system for match making and for sure a better system than the current tribunal system. Now I admit I can be salty and flame every so often, but I dont let that stop me from getting those objectives that matter. For me another point of credit I will put forward is this, when I first started this account, getting honour was easy, people are actually ok in the lower levels. I have acquired every honor ribbon in the game currently and I did so before reaching level 20-25 on my account. i know how to help players improve their game, teach them tactics and plays and what have you, I even dabble sometimes in helping the opposite team should a certain champion crop up (dont be surprised I am really critical of you karma players hehe - she's me bae {{champion:43}} ). I cant even remember the last good ranked game I had that was a tit for tat match. All I ever see is a game lost to a bad jungler, adc or mid/top laner. Heck not too long ago I was jg and my team won every lane (our lucian adc was 17 for 2 at one stage) and like 25 minutes in we had taken one tower down and instead of gettting those damn towers the garen and lucian roamed mid leaving our lanes to be pushed and of course, we buckled under the pressure of minions. With all this said, I am pretty sure I have only seen two successful bans i have submitted, which I am pretty sure at this stage range well into the hundreds. The general attitude I get presented with by fellow summoners, even in ARAM, currently my favourite map type defies belief. Some say 'this is just an aram' as if there are normal and ranked ARAM's and the other golden one is 'this is aram, you have to assume people are bad with champions' (I hate to have to point this out, but these both combine into a double negative...(One justifies being bad with the other)).. oh man don't get me started on scrubs playing ranked with a random build they got off the internet hahaha that makes me cringe. I love being discredited by people for my utility builds too...

People have more understanding in normals from what I can see. I guess most just play, play, play, and never play to improve, or watch the pros.
