The skins are great, the champs are enjoyable and the community (well, most of it anyway) is super good. But the one problem I have is its gameplay.\r\n\r\nAnd no, I&#039;m not talking about RNG or balancing or anything like that, I&#039;m talking about hitboxes, mainly. I&#039;ve seen so, so many abilities hit when the actual animation itself just flat out misses (e.g {{champion:222}} W &amp; R, {{champion:53}}  Q, {{champion:99}}  Q, the list goes on) and normally I&#039;m okay with it. But recently I&#039;m noticing it happening maybe a bit too much during dashes or teleports. For example, just last game I picked {{champion:254}} and the enemy team had a {{champion:99}}  in support, and every time I went to dash in, halfway through I get the notification that I&#039;ve been stunned - WHEN LUX AIMS AT MY OLD POSITION. \r\n\r\nAnd yes, I know it&#039;s meant to compensate for lag between people that are playing, but it&#039;s over the top nowadays. I just feel like there should be a lot more hitbox scrubbing going on, since so many of these abilities don&#039;t appear to hit. Not to mention an update on Blitzcrank&#039;s and Nautilus&#039; Ability Tooltip that shows just how far out said hooks go, Since regular players of that notice that Blitz&#039;s Q is maybe 120 units longer than it appears and Nautilus&#039; Tooltip is about the same.\r\n\r\nWill this ever get an update or am I the only one feeling like this is a massive problem?","replies":[{"poster":"Ailithic","date":"2017-11-27T19:44:31.446+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"So Blitz rocket grab is 925 which is about the same radius as kindred W, Thought you would mention illaoi's Q which has the biggest hitbox issue I think, like even if both your feet are outside of the outline on the ground you'll get hit. (actually I think its one player space between you and the outline you get hit lol)\n\nIdk try turning off movement prediction if its on though.","replies":[]},{"poster":"QAPLA","date":"2017-11-27T11:18:37.788+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"When it looks like it missed, but it 'hit' (or vice versa), that's client side discrepancy. It hit (or missed) on the server, sometimes your client gets it wrong.

Can you use the replay feature and share?\n","replies":[{"poster":"PerkyNipNops","date":"2017-11-26T22:23:12.090+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"Fine, a root, which might as well be a stun as a melee. And there's no need to just use mine as a suggestion, there are thousands of youtube videos which show what I'm saying too!","replies":[]}]}]}
