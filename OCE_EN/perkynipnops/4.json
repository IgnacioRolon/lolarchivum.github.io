But now I have something to directly address the game. \r\n\r\nThese past few patches which have been talking about making gameplay &quot;fairer&quot; to a support main like me is complete and utter bullshit. In the Bronze ELO (and yes, I know Riot looks at the higher elo&#039;s, not bronze, but I still think it&#039;s fair that we should be looked at as well), I honestly think the following champs are stupid broken and Riot really needs to re-think their changes:\r\n* {{champion:67}} &#039;s W and Q are overall broken. Her W is basically giving her free Armor Pen, ruining champs like Leona, Nautilus and Thresh\r\n\r\n* {{champion:53}} &#039;s Q hitbox is still dumb, I&#039;ve seen it reach places it really shouldn&#039;t\r\n* {{champion:37}} &#039;s Passive is still far too strong when combined with Lich Bane, turning her into an ADC shredder\r\n* {{champion:223}} &#039;s E is still giving him too much control with too little a mana cost\r\n* {{champion:7}} because, let&#039;s face it, being able to kill a full health, all MR trundle with an ult and a W is still broken\r\n* {{champion:143}} FAR too many plants. The passive timer needs to be increased by at least 2 seconds\r\n* {{champion:429}} Her E is still ridiculously OP, and it&#039;s insanely difficult for the opposition to determine how many spears they can take\r\n\r\n\r\nI&#039;ll probably increase this as i go.","replies":[{"poster":"Corehog","date":"2016-06-13T07:33:53.964+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I just want to address a couple of points here that I think you might of overlooked.\n\n\n - {{champion:67}}  is designed to shred tanks. Her entire kit is supposed to be used to clear waves and kill enemy champs as quickly as possible. If Vayne doesn't, and she gets caught, she's almost guaranteed to be killed.\n\n - {{champion:37}}'s passive isn't strong by itself. Your complaint should be that {{item:3100}} needs to be nerfed. Lich Bane **is** strong on Sona, but so is {{item:3115}} \n\n- {{champion:7}} is the same as Vayne. Designed to shred champs as quickly as possibly, but if she's caught she's dead.\n\n- {{champion:429}}'s spears can only stay in your body for 4 seconds each. During this time you need to apply some CC or kill her to stop her from Rending you. Additionally, each spear after the first one deals less damage when she uses Rend.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Omni Presents","date":"2016-06-12T09:30:24.161+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=PerkyTits,realm=OCE,application-id=FjGAIbRv,discussion-id=7Er6uv9i,comment-id=,timestamp=2016-06-12T08:03:38.049+0000)\n>\n> In the Bronze ELO (and yes, I know Riot looks at the higher elo&amp;#039;s, not bronze, but I still think it's fair that we should be looked at as well\n\nThey don't really even care for the higher ELO players, in the dynamic queue change they admittedly said they were focusing on the change due to increasing complaints from the top <1% of players.
