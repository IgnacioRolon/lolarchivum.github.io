I&#039;ve spent about $20AUD on them and about 25200 IP as well, so when these disappear, am I going to get anything back?\r\n\r\nAs well as that, whilst I am happy with the change to blue essence, but will there be increases to Mastery Achievements? I&#039;m sitting on 17K blue essence for this alone, and to see it increase would suck since it&#039;d make it significantly more difficult.\r\n\r\nJust seems like a lot is left in the grey. I&#039;d really love some extra clarification. I even saw a theory on a couple sites that there was gonna be unlockable skins with borders for 35000 essence or something, which would be awesome.","replies":[{"poster":"Project Xayah","date":"2017-09-03T12:20:39.034+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Rune Pages wont be disappearing, rather they will carry over to the new system. So however many Rune Pages you have now will be however many you have in the new system, with however many you purchase between now and then. The only difference will be that they'll be modifiable in champion select, like the current Mastery system. This is information that Riot Cactopus stated in a thread on the NA boards (link: https://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/developer-corner/RlNQkO39-buying-runes-between-now-and-preseason ).\n\nIt was also stated in the [Riot Pls: Levelling, IP and Rewards](http://nexus.leagueoflegends.com/2017/09/riot-pls-leveling-ip-and-rewards/) video that players would received 1500 Blue Essence for each Rune Page bought using IP, and an Epic Mystery Skin for every 4 Rune Pages bought using RP (rounding up).\n\nAs for \"Mastery Achievements\", I'm not quite sure what you mean. Could you elaborate a bit?","replies":[{"poster":"PerkyNipNops","date":"2017-09-04T21:34:23.027+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Sounds better than expected. I meant the Mastery Achievements as in the Level 6 and 7 Blue Essence requirements.\n\nAlso in terms of rounding up, since I bought 2 rune pages, do you think that would make me eligible?","replies":[{"poster":"Project Xayah","date":"2017-09-05T00:41:44.741+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"There's been no indication of changes to increases in the cost of \"promoting\" Mastery Levels to 6 and 7, so I doubt there will be any changes in that respect.\n\n> Also in terms of rounding up, since I bought 2 rune pages, do you think that would make me eligible?\n\nIt stands to reason that you would be eligible, so long as they were purchased with RP. The example used in the video is regarding 11 Rune Pages bought using RP, which would put the \"final group\" at 3. They have explicitly stated \"rounding up\", so it stands to reason it would count as long as there's at least 1 Rune Page in that \"final group\", with all previous groups (if any) filled with 4. I can ask for further clarification on that, if you would like a definite answer.","replies":[{"poster":"PerkyNipNops","date":"2017-09-06T02:08:36.629+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"If you could that'd be awesome :) although I can imagine a lot of people abusing it if they wanted to get an epic skin for a lower price if they bought just 1 rune page.","replies":[{"poster":"Project Xayah","date":"2017-09-06T08:38:50.136+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I've started asking about clarification for the point, and will get back to you with an answer when I know more.\n\nAs for \"abusing\" the system, it's actually not possible. The cut-off point for Rune related rewards was the 1st of September, when most of the information regarding the rewards was announced and confirmed. Purchasing Rune Pages now will grant no more than what you are already eligible for.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]}
