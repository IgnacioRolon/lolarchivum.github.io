That is, someone else has gained access to your account and used those programs on it, resulting in this ban.\n\n**Second very important step:** Change any passwords that were the same as your League one (and avoid using same passwords for different sites), and change the password of the email address attached to your account as well.\n\n**Third:** Run an anti-virus scan. If your account is compromised and you don't know how, a virus or keylogger is a possiblity. If you don't have an anti-virus, I would recommend the free version of Malwarebytes.\n\n**Last step** is to follow through with support. \n\nIf the account was compromised, point them to the games you didn't play or whatever other signs there are and they will investigate. If the account was compromised, they'll ask you a whole bunch of questions to verify ownership of the account, and assuming you haven't willingly shared it in the past, you will usually get the account back and the ban revoked.","replies":[]},{"poster":"CJrealm","date":"2019-08-27T06:49:12.372+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Still no news from the support...{{sticker:zombie-nunu-bummed}}","replies":[{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2019-08-27T07:21:17.553+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Updating the ticket will drop you back to the bottom of the queue, but it will also get you a better answer faster.
