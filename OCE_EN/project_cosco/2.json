It says every minion hit is 3 stacks (while it is 6 on ARAM). \r\n\r\nAlso, I think the barrier summoner spell has a tooltip that presents grammatical errors (noticed in ARAM and only in game. Not sure it applies to Summoner&#039;s Rift)\r\n\r\nAlso, is there a chance that Bard gets more stack of his passive per chime, on ARAM? URF was balanced to allow him to reach a new milestone every 2 chimes. ARAM presents the problem that Bard can&#039;t roam as much as he needs to and sometimes the chimes spawn behind the enemy turret. I&#039;m not suggesting a drastic adjustment as the URF&#039;s one, but maybe even a new milestone every 4 chimes could make it a bit more forgiving to decide not to dive the turret for that sweet sweet chime that is dissapearing...","replies":[]}
