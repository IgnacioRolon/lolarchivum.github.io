While I think this is good for minor camps, blue and red buffs should work as dragon and baron (Kindred has to participate to the kill, but not necessarily give the killing blow).\r\n\r\nWhat if the enemy blue buff is marked and I want to give it to my mid? I have to decide whether to get a stack of my passive (which is crucial for Kindred) or help my team... I don&#039;t think this choice should be made.","replies":[{"poster":"DarkShade918","date":"2017-05-15T07:46:45.547+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Who gives their mid blue, wtf?\n\nAnyways, that decision is easy if it's enemy blue take it (deny the enemy jg) same with red\n\nbaron and dragon on the other hand, she shouldn't have to finish it off to get the stack (i agree on this point)","replies":[{"poster":"PROJECT Cosco","date":"2017-05-15T10:33:18.682+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Mmm... not sure whether I was clear. \nWhat happened in game was that I already had blue and my mark was on the enemy's blue.
