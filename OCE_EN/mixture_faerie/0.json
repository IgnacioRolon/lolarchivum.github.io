I can login in the game, but everything are black except the top line. I can&#039;t open the store, can&#039;t see the game history, can&#039;t begin the game. All in a word, I can&#039;t do anything except to login in the game. I have tried to change the DNS, to check my system reference and everything I can do, but it didn&#039;t work. I have found there are a lot of people having this problem like me. I hope there are some solutions that could help us.","replies":[{"poster":"Riot Cochese","date":"2015-07-17T05:25:32.954+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I play on a MBP laptop and not seeing this issue, I can verify we are running the same client version too, based on your screenshots.\n\nWhat OSX are you running on?
