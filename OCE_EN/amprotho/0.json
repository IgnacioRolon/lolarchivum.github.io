I often report those who act irrationally or ruin the game, but lately it seems my reports are poorly investigated, it has been a long time since my report was acknowledged and I was notified the reported player was punished. I feel like because of the amount of times I report players, Riot is beginning to think my reports are illegitimate or insincere, which I think is because of poor investigations.\r\n\r\nAnyway, I have been seeing a lot of people provoking others by doing something in-game (like Supports taking minion kills from the Adc, players baiting allies into a fight and then abandoning them, giving up but not going AFK). Things like that which is really frustrating and provocative, causing people to react and only doing those types of things to avoid looking toxic and being penalised when reported.\r\n\r\nMe being someone who will most likely react to that, being frustrated because I&#039;m not understanding why my teammate acts that way and receiving the penalty without even having my own report acknowledged. This has happened multiple times, my main account was banned because of 2 issues just like this, so I&#039;ve started a new account and gotten to level 28 which it seems for new players or low level accounts the in-game experience is just horrible and not welcoming, now my new account has received a chat restriction because of my most recent game.\r\n\r\nI was playing support, at around 7 minutes, my Adc and I had a fight in the bottom lane, we lost the fight and both died, the team scores became 8 - 2.\r\nSo our top and mid lane players both say they&#039;re &quot;giving up this game is over&quot; and I ask &quot;why what happened&quot;, they then say something along the lines of &quot;the jg is bad and our bot lane is feeding there&#039;s no point prolonging this game&quot;, blaming us for feeding with 1 death and for them both giving up, which would mean the loss of the game, telling everyone through all chat to report bot lane as well as our Jungler.\r\n\r\nThis is something I reacted to, I probably could have gone about this better but I began to argue with them because I don&#039;t believe it&#039;s fair they can blame me and fabricate reasons as to why everyone should report me, which could cause me to get reported and potentially receive penalties because of a number of reports or poor investigations into the report. So in my defence I said I would report them for giving up so early and being toxic. _(Toxic to me means they&#039;re doing something to ruin the game or make it a bad experience)_ and from there they continued to argue that I was the one ruining the game and they had done nothing to be toxic. Eventually because they used all chat so much, the opponents told me not to worry and to just ignore them, so I done that because I know what it&#039;s like to be penalised, something I really don&#039;t want to go through again, I have learnt my lesson from past chat restrictions and a ban to my main account..\r\n\r\nThrough the whole game they kept bothering me, even if I didn&#039;t respond, just for voting no to surrender they would say it&#039;s another reason to report me. The end of the game comes and they call our team &quot;noobs&quot; and &quot;trash&quot;, I report them and I would guess they both reported me. I go and start a new game and realise I have gotten a chat restriction when I enter the game.\r\n\r\nSO, I guess I deserve the chat restriction, I called them idiots and wasted some time arguing with them about who is causing problems.\r\n\r\nBut do they deserve some punishment? I only reacted to what they were saying, I only asked why they were giving up so I could reassure them we are still in the game. I didn&#039;t have intentions of arguing or blaming them for the state of the game. Yet my report was not even acknowledged by Riot, but their reports were taken sincerely and I received penalties almost immediately.\r\n\r\nSo here&#039;s a few questions I have...\r\n\r\n1. Are Riot even investigating or is everything based off of chat-logs? _(Considering it took 3-5 minutes for them to declare me the troublemaker, I feel they aren&#039;t looking into the reports thoroughly.)_\r\n\r\n2. Are Riot underestimating my reports because I have made many against players in the past?\r\n\r\n3. If the reports were thoroughly investigated, is it truly fair I am the only player to be penalised? _(Giving up is a category you can report someone for, they acted innocent in chat deliberately to avoid penalties.)_\r\n\r\n4. Is League at all welcoming to brand new players?\r\n\r\n\r\n_P.S. I&#039;m being completely honest in everything I say, I wouldn&#039;t take the time to write this and lie about the situation to make me look better when there is a clip of the game and chat logs as proof for Riot. I&#039;m just tired of the toxic players and the fact reporting them does nothing for me, I feel helpless and like the system is unfair._","replies":[{"poster":"alsex","date":"2017-05-14T23:07:04.200+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=AmProTho,realm=OCE,application-id=T8eq2lFQ,discussion-id=4peEHvPM,comment-id=,timestamp=2017-05-11T03:49:56.088+0000)\n>\n> So here&amp;#039;s a few questions I have...\n> \n> 1.
