I know my GPU is well capable of pushing out over 144fps at all times.\r\nFor reference: There&#039;s a video on YouTube where someone is playing ultra 1080p with a gtx750ti and an FX-6300 CPU - much lower specced than my PC yet he seems to achieve a constantly higher frame rate than what I ever get. \r\n\r\nAny solutions to this?","replies":[{"poster":"JesusForgotHisGA","date":"2017-04-08T07:30:57.703+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Have you checked to see if your GPU is boosting to 3D clocks and not sitting at 2D? League isn't very GPU intensive and even my 1070 will only boost to <1600mhz instead of it's normal 2000. Infact it sits much MUCH lower 90% of the time. You could try changing the power management mode in the nvidia control panel to adaptive or prefer maximum performance to see if that helps.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Tele","date":"2017-03-29T06:18:23.565+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey man, \n\nThe Wrenchmen are a bit busy this week, but I can try get the ball rolling in the meantime ;)\nIt would be super helpful for us if you could answer as many of these as you can:\n\n+ Do you have _\"wait for vertical sync\"_ enabled in League?\n\n+ Do you have _\"use movement prediction\"_ enabled in League?\n\n+ Do you have V-sync enabled for your driver?\n\n+ What do you usually run in the background while you play League?
