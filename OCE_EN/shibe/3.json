While this is happening I can still hear people on discord and they can still hear me. It&#039;s hard to play with horrible interruptions like this. \r\n\r\nSpecs: 4670k/GTX980/16GB DDR3/120GB SSD/1TB HDD/ 144hz Monitor. \r\n\r\nGraphics driver updates do nothing to help.\r\nLeague is the only game that crashes for me (Except PUBG but that&#039;s understandable). \r\n\r\nI&#039;d love some help to be able to finish this issue. I tried pinpointing it to a program such at Plays.tv so I uninstalled but the crashes still occur. I do not use Xbox DVR or record with shadowplay.","replies":[]}
