Lately it has gotten unbearable but I dont exactly know if its a problem worth replacing my graphics card. Would really like some help fixing this.\nMy laptop consists of:\nCPU: Intel core i5-3210M\nGPU: NVIDIA GeForce 610M\n(This is my first post so I dont know how to add an image, but Im sure If I knew it would make the job a lot easier for you)","replies":[{"poster":"ABlueQuaker","date":"2016-08-23T11:23:33.249+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Reinstall your graphics driver. Make sure that you're not using integrated graphics.\n\nThere's every possibility your Graphics Card has simply had it. No point replacing it though - get a whole new laptop. It's a 5 year-old graphics card. It's not *meant* to last this long.","replies":[{"poster":"xReese","date":"2016-08-24T05:55:57.090+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Fixing my issues might not be that exciting for you and you probably do it a lot, but thank you so much for that comment.
