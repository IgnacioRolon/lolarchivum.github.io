I'm in bronze but then again don't play ranked much. I'll start saving up for Fiora after the hextech project chaches xD","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"shadowalien13","date":"2016-07-31T11:50:37.060+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Which one first, obviously...\nOf course I will get both.

In a way think of it like a wooden shield but with steel tiped spikes on it of an iron shield with no spikes on it.\n\nWith that in mind I'm going to give you my opinion:\n\nGo Fiora if you wish for a tank with tons of dmg and requires high skill... But is quite effective when learned properly and can be used properly (I've seen some of those Fioras out there and some of them are quite scary)\n\nGo Gnar if you want a general purpose high health tank with good cc and can peel well for the adc as well as some mobility and outplay potential (for example hopping into the middle of the team and landing a 5 man stun)\n\nGood Luck choosing and good luck mastering who ever you choose.
