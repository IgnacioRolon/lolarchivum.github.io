I want to be able to queue jungle/mid or jungle/top so maybe ekko or diana? Idk. I&#039;ve played all of them and love all of them. I realise that ekko and kz got buffed recently so maybe them. I want to carry my trash bronze 4 team so take that into account. I like assassin/fighters and versatility, so that i have a bunch of different options for a lot of circumstances. There tend to be a lot of full ad teams so if i get an AP first then the enemy team would be forced to either build mr just for me or build armour for my team, right? Take everything into account please and if you can try not to make a biased decision, though i woudn&#039;t really mind, i want it from a neutral point of view\r\n\r\nOR, should i get fizz to just go with my current junglers (Yi, Vi, Gragas[occasionally]etc...) and save up for others later?\r\n\r\nBasically, what order should i get them in and why? If you need any clarification PM me or ask here.\r\nThanks,\r\n\r\nP.S. I know i am asking a lot out of you guys, but thank you for taking the time to read this and if you have, replying to it.","replies":[{"poster":"Crunch","date":"2016-04-10T16:03:05.173+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Coming from one of the most experience Kha'Zix players on the server [(Season 4 Stats)](https://gyazo.com/fcb25eea24a049e6e5107525e5eb4f09) [(Season 3 Stats)](https://gyazo.com/c6016a47d514eb794c13a933dcb577c7), I'm actually going to tell you that Ekko would be a better pickup. \n\nAlthough I do love my main man Kha, he's struggling to find a place within the season 6 meta. There are too many champions that offer great peel/CC being played at the moment which just stop Kha'Zix from doing his thing. \n\nIn top we are seeing the likes of\n{{champion:245}} , {{champion:111}} ,{{champion:33}} These guys are all too tanky for Kha to fight in general unless he gets really ahead. They also will provide a ton of presence in a teamfight which can disrupt your resets.\n {{champion:114}}  {{champion:48}} etc. Khazix can't really effectively duel them as he can't take them down in a rotation and the Grasp of the Undying mastery will really outdo him after that. \n\nJunglers in the Meta such as {{champion:245}}  {{champion:77}} {{champion:113}} {{champion:79}} have all had success building some damage and tank successfully. They have great teamfight presence with their CC and general tank scaling.\n\nKha'Zix is a high snowball champion which really needs great opportunities of Isolation to be able to succeed. Although his Skirmishing is amazing with Isolation at Level 6, I feel that we are seeing a game of split pushers or teamfighters far more regularly now. Unlike Ekko he cannot build tank and have similar success due to the fact his base damages are too low, meaning he NEEDS to purchase Attack Damage to be effective. \n\nEkko's kit is far more rounded and versatile to be able to adapt to a range of team compositions. He can build full damage and 3-hit people with his combo or be one of the most fierce tank top's in the game! (100% Pick Ban in OPL Finals!) Offering a ton of mobility, CC, Waveclear and general safety thanks to his ultimate, I feel he fills a lot of roles within teams. This way if you are looking to play a lot of him, you'll be able to adjust yourself to best fit your team or negate the enemy's. \n\nFor now Ekko is most certainly a hugely popular champ and able to fill 3 roles (Top/Mid/Jungle) to great success in the Meta. Kha'zix however is really limited to jungle at the moment, and in doing so you substitute a situationally high damage assassin instead of a meta jungler who offers some CC/Tank role within the team.\n\nNow I'm not saying Kha'Zix is a bad champion, or that you won't have success on him. I just feel he's slightly more niche and situational than Ekko who can really just fulfill alot more needs and opens up room to be played more.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Fitzky","date":"2016-04-07T08:19:36.311+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"{{champion:121}} {{champion:121}} {{champion:121}} {{champion:121}} {{champion:121}} {{champion:121}} {{champion:121}} {{champion:121}} {{champion:121}} {{champion:121}} {{champion:121}} {{champion:121}} {{champion:121}} {{champion:121}} {{champion:121}} {{champion:121}} {{champion:121}} {{champion:121}} {{champion:121}} {{champion:121}} {{champion:121}} {{champion:121}} {{champion:121}} {{champion:121}} {{champion:121}} {{champion:121}} {{champion:121}} {{champion:121}} {{champion:121}} {{champion:121}} {{champion:121}} {{champion:121}} {{champion:121}} {{champion:121}} {{champion:121}} {{champion:121}} {{champion:121}} {{champion:121}} {{champion:121}} {{champion:121}}","replies":[{"poster":"Bambooze","date":"2016-04-07T12:26:44.602+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"^","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Electricshard","date":"2016-04-07T08:14:23.540+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"At the moment ekko is really strong especially tank ekko top, I believe he has a 56% win rate.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Peter Steele","date":"2016-04-07T07:42:11.569+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I would have said Diana but I have never played Kha'Zix.
