A charged Nidalee spear with Rylais is enough to slow down an entire enemy team lategame, and if you take the time to learn her she can carry harder than the other two.\n\nRengar is a good short term investment. The shock factor is what makes Rengar so strong at the moment, but skilled players can shut him down easily. That being said, he's practically freelo in Bronze so go for your life!\n\nTrundle is really versatile, but since the nerf to his bite (and thus his splitpush) he's a little less versatile than he used to be.

However, I the only reason that i can think of that I haven't bought him is because I don't want to spend (and possibly waste) 4800 IP someone that I have no idea if I will find fun. I totally want to get voli, but until he goes on free week or I get other champions with a higher priority, I'm just worried to get him.\n\nThanks for reminding me about him. I've been interested in him since before I even installed the game. I was just perusing through the champion list under game info and he was one of the several that caught my eye and got me to click on them for more info.","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Talon12","date":"2016-03-05T10:08:33.428+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"but trundle is easy to play...

I will get nidalee now, because I like her kit and I love the idea of changing forms and I did really well with her early clears when I see other people having a hard time with it.\nSo that's settled.

Trundle seems like a good choice for the tankiness and versatility. Rengar however, dispite his \"nerfs\" that didn't seem like nerfs to me, but I probably misread the patch notes, seems good to carry and assassinate carries. At least, thats how they appear to me. I've only played Rengar once and that game i did alright on him but didn't know how to manage his ferocity or anything. I have no experience with Trundle so out of those two (or another) I could try.
