{"poster":"Lonely Flame","date":"2018-09-05T17:08:54.870+0000","title":"Repeatedly getting disconnected from game despite internet connection being perfectly fine","subforum":"Help & Support (OCE)","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"So this has been happening to me frequently since the latest patch. I will be playing the game, everything will be perfectly fine, but then my character no longer receives input. I can move my mouse around, but right click does nothing. I can open the chat box and type, but nothing sends. But this isn&#039;t immediate disconnect so that my character starts heading straight back to spawn. This is 10-15 seconds before I get disconnected, giving them enemy player a perfect amount of time to kill a frozen player in lane while I stand there and watch.\r\n\r\nThen I&#039;ll get disconnected, and cannot reconnect to the game. As said in the title, my internet is perfectly fine. I have gamed for hours on the same connection with no issue with other game. I can tab out of my disconnected game, open up youtube, and watch people play League of Legends. But I can&#039;t play it. My game doesn&#039;t reconnect. Typically I&#039;ll have to completely close the client all together, reopen it, log in, and hopefully, maybe, I get reconnected at a point where my opponent is now not just 1 kill up, but 2 levels over me at minimum. But, in some cases, I&#039;m not lucky the first time, and so I have to spend 5 minutes trying to connect back into the same game that I&#039;m going to be penalised for when I&#039;ve done nothing wrong.\r\n\r\nThis has happened 5 games in a row now. I&#039;ve run a Full Repair on the client. There&#039;s no issues. My internet is fine. I am beyond livid at this stage to put it politely.","replies":[{"poster":"K√ºrama","date":"2018-09-06T22:27:07.661+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"üôÉ Greetings!\n\nIt's possible to experience connectivity issues with League alone and it sounds like your network and the servers stopped communicating for a short period, resulting in your disconnections. \n\n[üåê Run through this connectivity guideüåê](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues) and let us know if the disconnections subside!\n\n||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||https://puu.sh/w6V29/dc98f0c6a9.jpg|\n|-\n---\nhttps://puu.sh/BmZZN/e580a5eb4b.png","replies":[{"poster":"Lonely Flame","date":"2018-09-21T16:22:24.175+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey,\nI've gone through your connectivity guide. It took forever, but I went through it all. It's still happening every other game. I've instead decided to uninstall League of Legends, as I'm typically leaving games more annoyed than satisfied. Hopefully at a later date the client works. Until then, thanks for your help.","replies":[]}]}]}
