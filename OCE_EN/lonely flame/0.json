{"poster":"Lonely Flame","date":"2015-05-27T04:42:48.756+0000","title":"Skin Concept - Doc Brown Zilean and Marty McFly Ekko","subforum":"Player Creations","up_votes":12,"down_votes":1,"body":"So yeh Back to the Future themed skins. I feel the most memorable outfits are from Back to the Future 2 (the one where they go to the future), so these skins are based off them [link](http://earnthis.net/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/bttf2.jpg).\nI think the picture pretty much speaks for itself in terms of what the skins would look like and how they would translate onto the characters, so I won&#039;t go into too much detail with them. Instead I&#039;ll just mention some of the finer details they could add. Please also note these names are placeholders and used more so it's clear from the get go what the concept is. I don't really know what to call them.\n\n**Zilean**\nThe giant clock that floats behind him is the face from the clock tower from all 3 movies [link](http://www.independent.co.uk/migration_catalog/article5076395.ece/alternates/w620/back%20to%20the%20future.jpeg). Whether the hands move or stay frozen at 10:04 like in the movie is optional. Alternatively, he could have a giant board with the [time circuit](http://vignette4.wikia.nocookie.net/bttf/images/d/d5/Time_Circuits_BTTF.png/revision/latest?cb=20110823082816) that flick through different things.\nFor his ult, if the champion dies, while they&#039;re in stasis it could play the noise the delorean makes when it arrives from a time period [link](https://youtu.be/wwTj7SwzcHI?t=37s) so that when the champion revives it&#039;s like they came back.\n\nLines to add (if possible)\nGreat Scott!\nThe way I see it, if you&#039;re gonna travel through time, why not do it with some style?\nPrecisely!\n88...there&#039;s just something about that number. (shared similarly with Hiemerdinger)\n\n**Ekko**\nHis bat is replaced with the hoverboard. Other than that I don&#039;t think much else needs changing.\n\nLines to add (if possible)\nHeavy.\nWhat&#039;s that?! *points*","replies":[{"poster":"CptStupendous","date":"2015-05-28T09:58:56.029+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":0,"body":"I would love this skin like my first child.
