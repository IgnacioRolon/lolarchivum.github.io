If you play support with the assumption you have an adc, then support.\nJungle, your laners won't understand jungle pressure, but on the other hand, enemy laners won't ward either.\nBut generally, adc is hardest since you don't have a support, and low elo players like assassins.","replies":[{"poster":"ThatsBS","date":"2018-04-12T09:50:12.986+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"So what would be the easiest?","replies":[{"poster":"Nightjar","date":"2018-04-12T10:22:39.367+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"hmm depends on what your strength is. \n\nFor instance, if you're good at duelists and measuring up in a 1v1, I'd say top. Pick a midgame fighter and splitpush your way to victory.\nIf you have good mechanics and remember to roam, mid, take a dump on the enemy adc since they will have 0 peel.\nIf you're good at taking game momentum and running wild with a snowball, jungle. Make the enemy team ff at 15 because their jungle is afk farming whilst you proceed to oneshot anyone who forgets to hug tower.\nIf you're good at tanks and knowing exactly how much you can do, support tank with ignite. If your adc complains that you haven't given him an assist, mute him.\nIf you're good at mage/enchanter supports, still take ignite. If you somehow get a competent adc, you'll naturally support them. If they're bad, shields aren't terrible and full ap sona/lulu/karma is still a thing.\nIf you're good at last hitting and positioning... probably still don't play adc without a reliable duo support.","replies":[{"poster":"ThatsBS","date":"2018-04-21T23:29:31.141+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thanks, I love the challenge though of playing adc. Even if you have good farm kda etc, you can still lose the game. Is probably because my kill participation wasnt giod enoigh? I.e. not involved in team fights? My issue with that is sometimes 2 take in 4 enemy etc... i dont know why id want to go in on that haha... still would be a 3 v 4... i thought i should hang with sup and start picking  them off through  warding well.","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"kaboomblah","date":"2018-04-14T06:42:32.324+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Support, Support, Support, and Support.\n\nAuto-filled Supports at any ELO are much wow.

Sure, there are more than a few who just can't do sh!t right, but you get that with every position. When it comes down to it, Support and Jungle (more so Support) are the positions that receive the most flak for other peoples mistakes and things they're already doing that people think they aren't (warding and vision control, for example).\n\nWith Top and Mid, they're essentially \"solo jobs\", which I think most low elo players are comfortable with (often being focused on the \"individual\" and not the \"team\" aspect). They don't mind being on their own for the most part, and so Top and Mid are ideal for that. Again, there are always those who just can't get sh!t right, but that's (generally) not so much of a problem with Top and Mid, so long as they don't lose their cool.\n\nThe real issue is ADC. Part of what makes ADC \"unique\", in this respect, is that it is the *only* position that is of neither a \"support\" or \"solo\" nature, and this causes problems for a lot of players. It should also be noted that there is always significant pressure on the ADC to be getting kills, sometimes so much so that it's considered \"above all else\", and so effectively creates a \"deathmatch\" mentality, which isn't ideal for a game like LoL. Not only that, but there is also pressure on the ADC to be the \"biggest\" damage dealer on the team. When it comes down to it, it's relatively easy to screw up as the ADC, when compared to other positions, since there's so much that's expected of them.\n\nWell, that's my opinion, anyway. Take it or leave it.","replies":[]},{"poster":"DarkShade918","date":"2018-04-12T10:21:52.737+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Support, taking care of babies and being stuck 1v9 is the life of a low elo support main.\n\nThe only time support is easy is when you're duo queued, or you pick an AP mid as \"support\"","replies":[]}]}
