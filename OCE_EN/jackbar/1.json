Tried turning on smartcast and re-binding QWER to it, but they wouldn't cast. Flash and TP worked, W and E could cast (e only when not on smartcast and I could click) but Q and Ultimate wouldn't cast for the remaining gametime (And yes, I died, went into passive and respawned, didn't fix)\r\n\r\nMight want to disable him, if that happened in ranked I would be insanely pissed off.","replies":[{"poster":"HORSE OF FORCE","date":"2015-01-19T10:25:39.035+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Put it in [this board](http://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/bug-report).","replies":[]}]}
