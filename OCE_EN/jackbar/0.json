Closed with no freeze or not-responding, just shut down. \nReopened, got the fairly common problem where clicking start would just close the screen and not launch, tried deleting the rads lol launcher, didn't fix it. Then tried deleting the OC1 config and air client with empty downloads/solution folders, restarted and relaunched as admin, didn't help either, it just crashed before opening. I then ran a repair via the setup in leagueoflegends folder, didn't help. Figured it would be faster to just do a clean reinstall and repatch, so I completely deleted the Riot Games folder and contents and re-downloaded from the OCE.leagueoflegends.come mirror, which worked up until about half an hour into patching when I got this Unspecified error message. \nTried running in admin, restarting, and then running a repair through the client itself rather than the setup file which just scanned and then put me back at square one (see image)\n\nIt takes about 10 seconds to scan, then immediately skips to 32% and says the error occurred. I've checked the logs, I have 9 plain text files there but no idea what I'm looking for. \n\nShould I send this to support or is someone here capable of helping me?","replies":[{"poster":"Jackbar","date":"2015-01-07T14:20:25.424+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"New problem. \nOnly thing I could think of was registry errors messing up the uninstall, so I ran a registry clean and defrag, rebooted and started patching again, this time it takes a while to get passed scanning differences and then starts \"patching\" at around 7kbps until 5%, then it stops and sits at 0.00kbps and doesn't change. \n\nSo it would seem that the unspecified error was a registry problem, but that's caused a whole other issue with the repatching. Take note of that for the future boys :)","replies":[{"poster":"Jackbar","date":"2015-01-07T14:21:37.549+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"New log after last attempted patch : \n\nINFO: maestro [server] initializing...\nERROR: The file [] does not exist.
