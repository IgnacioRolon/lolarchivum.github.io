My whole team was lagging even in a fricking BEGINNERS BOTS game. I COULD OT CONNECT FOR 3 RANKED GAMES and lagged out.\r\n\r\n I sent in a support ticket. I had huge discussions with their Technicians. The technicians said they are working with the internet service providers to fix this issue. They say it is a packet loss problem. Riot admits it is their fault and still they punish players for not intentionally leaving the game and also because  riots server was broken. \r\n\r\nI still get punished, my team gets punished for Riots fault. Can they at least manually override the leaver buster? Guess they won't cause they favor to make us suffer.\r\n\r\nGood Job Riot. You are just making us suffer. Seriously the new leaver buster system is just focused on North American Server where the Elites live. Poor Oceania people need to have their leaver buster punishment reduced. Riot too stingy to afford good server. Riots has to start writing good codes to help maintain a healthy internet connection with the New Zealand Internet Service providers.\r\n\r\nYOUR CUSTOMERS ARE TRYING TO MAINTAIN HEALTHY RELATIONSHIP, BUT YOU JUST PUNISH THEM FOR BY HANDING OUT SWEET LEAVERBUSTER 20MINS WAITING QUEUE.\r\n\r\nGOOD JOB RIOT.","replies":[{"poster":"Garlygunto","date":"2015-02-20T13:13:41.672+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"its true riot is falsly punishing players for nothing, i have to wait 20 mins everytime for the next 5 matches cause i got a message say i have been afk too any times, look at my match history i havent been afk in the last 30 or so matches, i reckon there doing it on purpose cause they dont like certain players winning ranked games, so they fix it","replies":[]},{"poster":"HORSE OF FORCE","date":"2015-02-05T06:57:55.689+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Guess the gods aren't on your side with this one.","replies":[]},{"poster":"godsmustbecrazy3","date":"2015-02-04T21:57:24.841+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"RITO PLS WHY DO THIS: TEARS TEARS\n\nA new version of LeaverBuster is now available\nNow, Riot Games confirms on its website that a fresh and much tougher version of LeaverBuster is now available in League of Legends.\n\nAccording to the developer, players will be warned upon their first leave from a match, and if they continue this behavior, the punishments will get tougher and tougher.\n\n\"The first time a player leaves a game, they’ll see a pop-up explaining that leaving is not okay and then have to manually agree to not leave future games. If they continue to ruin other players’ experiences, they’ll enter lower-priority matchmaking for a number of games. While in low priority queue, players will experience queue times that are 5, 10, even 20 minutes longer than a player who hasn't left games.\"\nGroups with a serial leaver will also be punished\nPlayers who continue leaving matches won't be able to escape punishment by joining pre-made groups, as all members will be notified that they are playing with a chronic leaver and will face the same lower-priority time penalty as a team.\n\nThe LeaverBuster system doesn't stop here and will even issue bans for those that continue to leave games despite all these warnings and punishments, so you might want to ensure that you have a stable Internet connection and enough time for a League of Legends match before joining one.","replies":[]},{"poster":"godsmustbecrazy3","date":"2015-02-04T21:33:30.778+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I don't care horse if you are trying to suck up to RIOT. \n\nRIGHT NOW AT THIS MOMENT I AM TYING, MY WHOLE TEAM IS STUCK ON THE GAME CLIENT CHAT. eVERYONE RAGING AND TYPING SINCE THERE STUCK THERE.
