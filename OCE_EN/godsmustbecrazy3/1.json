Spoke to the Riot Technician. The Riot technician said it was ISP's fault. I tried all the steps mentioned on the support webpage. \n\nSpoke to my ISP too and all they could do was turn the interleaving off. \n\nNow moving to a different ISP, they are very expensive compared to my present ISP Flip. I am getting ripped off but what else can I do if Riot didn't fix the firewall error for 7 months. \n\nBought a brand new modem too for 150 dollars but LOL still won't work. Every other online game works flawlessly, even Destiny works flawlessly for me. \n\nGood luck with finding the problem.\n\nThanking you.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"HORSE OF FORCE","date":"2015-02-09T00:03:00.305+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Probably infinity.

I just wish they remove the reporting options too, so I can afk in peace :)\n\nAs you mentioned, I have to quit playing for a week or more I guess until they fix this issue.\n\nThanks man :)","replies":[{"poster":"HORSE OF FORCE","date":"2015-02-09T10:57:25.625+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":">I just wish they remove the reporting options too, so I can afk in peace :)\n\nThat would probably cause a lot more problems than it would give solutions, my friend.\n\nRetiring from the game for a bit is probably the most selfless thing you can do. Do make sure you check your connection a few times in custom games on a weekly basis, at least.","replies":[]}]}]}]}
