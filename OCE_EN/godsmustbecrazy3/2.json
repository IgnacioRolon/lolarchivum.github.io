Go to Device Manager and right click on the Ethernet controller you are using to connect to your internet and select update. If it says the Ethernet controller is already up to date, then go right click on your Ethernet controller and click properties and copy the  DEVICE BRAND name. Then do a Google search by pasting  your \"DEVICE BRAND name\" DRIVERS.\n\nYour Ethernet controller will be either under \"NETWORK ADAPTER TAB/DROPDOWN OR OTHER DEVICE TAB/DROPDOWN\"\n\nIMPORTANT: UPDATE THE DRIVERS BOTH MANUALLY BY GOOGLE SEARCHING FOR THE DRIVERS AND AUTOMATICALLY BY RIGHT CLICKING ON THE MENU. \n\nExample below for wired adapters:\nWired images attached\n\n\n2) Use this Microsoft tool:  http://support.microsoft.com/kb/299357 \n\nOr for Windows 7 you can do them manually:\n\nQuoted from the Microsoft Website:\n\nFor Windows 7 and Windows Vista:\n\n    To open a command prompt, click Start and then type cmd in the Search programs and files box.\n    Under Programs, right-click the CMD.exe icon, and then click Run as administrator.\n    When the User Account Control box appears, click Yes.\n    At the command prompt, enter the following command, and then press Enter:\n\n    netsh int ip reset c:\\resetlog.txt\n\n    Note If you don't want to specify a directory path for the log file, run the following command instead:\n\n    netsh int ip reset resetlog.txt\n\n    Restart the computer.\n\nThe solution above worked for me after I  have  tried 20 different solutions. Also disable and remove your Windows defender, DISABLE Windows Firewall, disable antivirus firewall,  Go to internet options and uncheck tsl 2.0 and tsl 3.0 and check tsl 1.0. Install framework 3.5.1, disable IP helper, DISABLE IPV6, uninstall league completely using rev uninstaller pro , don't forget to delete the registries and reinstall league of legends from scratch. Ask your ISP to turn the INTERLEAVING OFF.","replies":[{"poster":"HORSE OF FORCE","date":"2015-01-19T04:00:31.971+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"That's a very descriptive and well set out tutorial, two things though.\n\n1. Blaming Riot. They don't change the config of your computer, they just made the game not run with *specific* configurations, due to faulty programming or the attempt to optimize.\n\n2. Google. Not everyone in the world uses Google, or even search engines in general, so don't make it seem like it's the only option.\n\nBut yes, I'll be checking these settings out.","replies":[]}]}
