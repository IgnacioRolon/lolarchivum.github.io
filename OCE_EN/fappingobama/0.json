Keep in mind I&#039;m a very intolerant person, much like thousands of other people, and there are times when you get those people in matches that just find bliss and enjoyment from trolling, by either talking shit (doesn&#039;t bother me at all, there&#039;s a lovely mute button), purposely feeding, intentionally roaming to other lanes, taking CS, kills or just plain feeding your lane, and it&#039;s these people that just anger you to the point that you just don&#039;t want to deal with their shit, so you leave. You get pissed off in a game, and do the smart choice by backing off, taking a break for a few hours to calm down, and you get punished for it. For being a normal person that doesn&#039;t tolerate people that just want to annoy others, you can get punished for it.\r\n\r\nEven if there other reasons for having to or being forced to leave a game (Dinner, having to go to work, being disconnected from a match and unable to reconnect etc) Riot seems to punish people for leaving matches, me, being one of those people. I don&#039;t know if riot doesn&#039;t care or there&#039;s no way to find out why someone left a match, but the fact that they refuse to remove someone&#039;s low priority queue even if there IS a legitimate reason is kinda stupid. Having to waste time on a client where you can&#039;t do anything whilst the timer is going down from that grueling 20 minutes to 0 is what annoys me the most. I&#039;m a casual, like many others, and we play the game to have fun and improve our skills in the game, and it&#039;s hard to do that whilst we&#039;re waiting 20 minutes to begin a queue. \r\n\r\nIf low priority isn&#039;t gonna be changed/removed, you might as well be allowed to do things on the client (whatever one would do on the client) and have a low priority timer next to the regular queue timer.\r\n\r\nAnd let&#039;s be honest here, punishments should be sent out to people who play Teemo or be the last guy who doesn&#039;t accept the queue when it pops.","replies":[{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2016-02-15T08:23:21.833+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Basically, what it comes down to is, regardless of the reason for leaving, intentional or not, you are still affecting the game of 9 other people negatively. If it happens rarely then you won't be punished for it. If it is happening frequently then you will be. [You can find more info about the system here if you wish.](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752714-LeaverBuster-FAQ)\n\nIt's worth noting that the queue pop is basically an afk check, and it exists so people don't get leaver bustered by being afk in select, which is why it isn't punishable/wouldn't make sense to be. And picking off meta champions is not considered trolling (in normals/not ranked) and is not punishable.\n\nIf they are trolling then all you can do is mute, not engage them, and report them in post game and they will face punishments for their actions.","replies":[]}]}
