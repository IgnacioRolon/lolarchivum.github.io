Some is annoying support such as Shen, Alistar, etc. Some can even kill squishies, adc&#039;s, other tanks with a burst too. Now what do you guys think about this? Let me know. Either is it annoying, broken, OK, does not matter etc. Any opinion I can take.","replies":[{"poster":"Essembie","date":"2016-04-28T00:44:39.451+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"what is the question you're asking for a response to?

Why target the frontline tank who has very little dmg when you can just rush backline and take out the actual threats?","replies":[{"poster":"Lord Sesshomaru","date":"2016-04-28T04:54:41.044+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"im not basing it around a 1v1, thats an example to show how the damage/tankiness correlate.\n\nyoure never supposed to target the frontline tanks?\n\nand non damage high tankiness cc tanks are exactly what I'm saying tanks should be.","replies":[{"poster":"Z3npachi","date":"2016-04-28T06:47:09.063+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Lord Sesshomaru,realm=OCE,application-id=FjGAIbRv,discussion-id=dQTpdkzK,comment-id=000200000000,timestamp=2016-04-28T04:54:41.044+0000)\n>\n> im not basing it around a 1v1, thats an example to show how the damage/tankiness correlate.\n> \n> youre never supposed to target the frontline tanks?\n> \n> and non damage high tankiness cc tanks are exactly what I&#x27;m saying tanks should be.\n\nBut not all \"tank\" champs have huge CC and their ratios are different. You list Voli, he has only 1 form of throwback hard cc and 1 form of soft CC in a slow. Compare him to Naut who has q , passive, ult and a slow. Thats 1 hard 1 soft compared to 3 hard and 1 soft cc, so why shouldn't Voli do some dmg? His kit has a lot less forms of CC. Cho has only 1 knockup and a silence.\n\n\nSure in a 1v1 the tanks can put out decent dmg but with adcs will put out heaps more if positioned and protected correctly. The way dmg/tankiness correlate already exists, although it is apparent some champion kits are loaded a little better than others. This isn't a traditional RPG/MMO and having tanks with only cc and no dmg makes for a very stale meta.","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Z3npachi","date":"2016-04-28T02:41:27.645+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"IMO tanks should be doing some dmg, if they are relegated to CC bots with large HP pools then expect an exodus of players from that top lane role ( look at how few people actually enjoy playing supp or really appreciate what players can do from the supp role ). Tanks are much more powerful early-mid game, so I guess the problem is the amount of time it takes for an adc to become relevant and bust through the tanks is much longer coupled with increased death timers and games snowballing to the point where an adc doesn't come online before the game is over. So the lower your rank, the bigger problem you have with tank meta as generally you will acquire gold at a a slower rate and bleed objectives faster.\n\nAre we trying to balance professional play around tanks or are we trying to balance low rank dynamic que around them?","replies":[]},{"poster":"Mustaphah II","date":"2016-04-28T08:36:37.405+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"this game is sht, champion design is sht, balance, is sht, all riot care about is skins and perma banning ppl for saying fuck, league is garbage, battleborn and overwatch coming out soon death of league.","replies":[]}]}
