How can you do that in a permanent team-fight in a single lane?\n\nSo if you get an S on Eve in aram, have you really ‘mastered’ that champion?  Seeming the most important part of her kit is almost unusable and mostly redundant?\n\nThings like CSing, ganking, split pushing, objective prioritizing, etc.  just don’t come into play in ARAM.\n\nHow can you have ‘mastered’ Nasus, when you’ve built AP and ignored stacking your Q?\n\nAlso the champs aren’t even exactly the same as their summoners rift counterparts.  Many champs have adjusted stats to account for the different play style of ARAM.  So the champs aren’t even the same.\n\n_______________\n\nHowever, that being said.\nJust because ARAM champs don’t play the same.  Doesn’t mean mastering the ARAM style is any less of an achievement than the summoners rift style.  \n\nSo it’d be nice if there was some little reward you could get to show that you can play this champ on ARAM too.  \n\nBut even then that’s tricky because the system is random.  People will play ARAM to get a new mastery flair on their main, but it’s random so in theory people could play 2000 games and still never get their champ.  And that would be incredibly frustrating.","replies":[]},{"poster":"DarkShade918","date":"2019-09-26T23:53:09.273+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"Its not designed to, winning an ARAM doesn't show skill or mastery, because its random, you still get mastery points, but you don't get tokens, if you think its a bug, you're wrong","replies":[{"poster":"Hi Im Stanky","date":"2019-10-03T00:44:36.904+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Go have a look at the champion mastery of some of us ARAM mains and you will quickly come to realize how wrong you are.

Every Game is one sided, one team gets the Poke or Tank comp, and the other team gets nothing good - This doesn't show skill, this is all luck\n2. I'm a ziggs/thresh main, with support as my go to role when i play Rift, both of those champs are good on ARAM - This doesn't show any skill, this just shows that you can play a champ thats good on ARAM\n3. The only skill in ARAM is teamfighting, which can be done on rift in much more pivotal situations than \"because you can\" like it is on ARAM\n4. There are no objectives, no CSing, no ganking, nothing that shows skill\n\nARAM doesn't show skill, it shows you can teamfight for no reason","replies":[{"poster":"Hi Im Stanky","date":"2019-10-03T01:20:40.052+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"I'm sorry but you must be playing at a low level to be convinced of these things. Yes, it can be the case some games but it's most certainly not always written in stone and games can always sway any which way. It really does come down to comp. But also your S rank does still grade off of CSing and also I have special ARAM builds that perform too well! So how does none of this showcase champ mastery or skill?

Calling me low level is a pointless insult, when i stomp Plat+ in Norms/ARAM/Ranked (when i can play)\n\nDo you even know how the Mastery System works, CS is one of the biggest contributors in Norms/Ranked, in ARAM there is limited CSing, as you have to share with 4 other players (who probably can't last hit to save their life), so CSing is one of the lowest contributors to an S rank in ARAM. I can get an S rank in ARAM going 20/0, without having any damage and just ksing all game, there is no skill to ARAM other than how to Teamfight and even then your team is 90% of the time to incompetent to fight properly.","replies":[{"poster":"Hi Im Stanky","date":"2019-10-04T04:04:37.221+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Ad thresh and AP sona is troll now? xD That's not even a stretch, try Conq Mummy or DH ashe with Liandries. But in saying what you did you're admitting that ARAM has it's own playstyle and thus it's own mastery system? yes CS is the lowest contributor but that also admits to it's own playstyle?! Also its not even all about team fighting there's many aspects to an ARAM game and so yes in hearing your rebuttal I still think you're playing it at a low level.

It should just be EXP and/or BE (OE would be nice too, but riot will never give that out for free)","replies":[]}]}
