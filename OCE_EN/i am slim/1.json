Instead of going to the game load screen it kept the client and just went straight to &quot;skip waiting for stats&quot; and that&#039;s all I could do. Tried closing league and reopening it, which it wouldn&#039;t open. Restarted PC and opened it again only for it to randomly load half a patch. That completed and now if I click &quot;find match&quot; in any game mode nothing happens, won&#039;t queue up. Anyone else having any similar issues?","replies":[{"poster":"I am Slim","date":"2018-05-11T01:19:48.930+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Edit seems to be ok now.
