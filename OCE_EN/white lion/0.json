I believe it is a good stepping stone for getting htem to listen to me later in the game when we need to push and get objectives etc. Generally it works, People listen but probably only 60% of the time that they listen we win, now some of this is because maybe someone gets caught EG someone trying to be cheeky, and yes i do it occassionally, but other times its because like the last game, they stop listening right at the end. I persuaded team to get two inhibs and baron with 7 minutes, then after everyone had backed and bought, I said lets go top with baron buff and end, and no one came, 2 went jungling on other side of map and 2 went and tried fighting mid. Me asking politely top multiple times, spam pinging begging for them to group top so we can win as we have lane pressure advantage, then gets jumped by a gnar and sona. My fault, I got caught, I should have rotated and just helped team. But, this happens often, why do people listen for a portion of the game, and then decided they dont wnat to end or win? Because we ended up losing due to people getting caught out.","replies":[{"poster":"Fruitlewp","date":"2015-04-30T09:04:49.311+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"If you want consistent cooperation, you're going to have to make up a team of regulars - relying on the random queue is always going to be a 50/50 shot at getting a team that seeks to communicate effectively. But just as a tip, I wouldn't spam pings, or bark out orders as if they've agreed you're the leader all of a sudden. Suggest a move, but don't push it or spam, because more often not they'll just pop a mute on you. Particularly in Normals people don't play the game seriously enough to warrant paying attention to all manner of communication.\n\nIt would honestly be easier to just meet some people you play with regularly.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Yasei Doubutsu","date":"2015-04-28T09:31:29.902+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Usually if people start spamming pings on me, I wont do what they want.

What happen in that game is the opponent Nasus got really fed and just kill everyone and Q all the turrets GG.
