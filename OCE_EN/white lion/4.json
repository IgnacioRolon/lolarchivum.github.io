The enemy team just out warded us, they had wards in their jungle, then when I syarted getting ganked at my buffs, I tried pinking and warding but it wasnt enough, I asked my team to help ward, get some pinks down and clear the wards so I could jungle but no one did anything the whole game. I got 4-5 levels behind at one point, so in that situation, team isnt helping with wards, cant jungle, should I have just gone to a lane and just duo lane for a bit, what should I have done?","replies":[{"poster":"Fog","date":"2015-04-09T01:55:11.029+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"For starters what you're doing is great with the pink ward encouragement. Keep it up. I strongly suggest if you're not doing so already. As soon as you hit level 9. Get an upgraded sweeping lense. It costs 250 gold and is extremely valuable. Ideally I would hope to have two upgraded sweeping lenses at level 9 (jungle and support). This will greatly improve ward clearing. Also, pink efficiently.","replies":[{"poster":"White Lion","date":"2015-04-09T02:24:57.505+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"aah ok, Im so used to trinkets, I will definitely start doing that thanks.
