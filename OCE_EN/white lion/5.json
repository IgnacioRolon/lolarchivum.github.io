I have a serious problem which I have actively tried fixing and avoiding as it hurts my ability to climb, one of the last things I believe to be holding me back from getting out of silver.\r\n\r\nObviously I am not always consistent in my game play, which is why im probably silver lel. Also you get lads that tend to have their shit days when you play, but some of the games that get to late game, where my team have been behind all game and somehow ive managed to maintain life as an adc and carry fights when team provide best peels oce. As an example, last night, 50 minute game, we had an open nexus for about 20+ minutes, and we managed to somehow win 5-7 team fights on the nexus even when enemy had 3 super minion waves and baron buff, no idea how. I was Tristana, and just pwning the poon. \r\n\r\nBut we got to a point where I think everyone new one more fight and we could push to win, our inhibs were up again and we just won another fight, but we have only had 1 tower of theirs the whole game, so they start to baron again and we cant contest because 1 is dead and team is at base so I think that I can get a cheeky tower or two just to help the push after the fight, obviously this is the worst thing to do ever and I hate myself for it. Because they stopped baron and came straight for me, and ive gotten pretty good at dodging skill shots and almost killed morgana and lee whilst they chased me, but Lee flash q&#039;d and it landed :( and I ulted him as he hit the second q at which point vayne who has her vayne damage on Q, flash tumbles me as I flash away and it crit strikes me for a third of my health, I howled in distress.\r\n\r\nSo anyway, story time. What are some ways to remain patient and not push the envelope, because during a game I am usually very patient and keep my team in check because they tend to do that, but if its a long intense game, I always crack.  I would really like to change this.","replies":[{"poster":"Fog","date":"2015-03-27T02:43:45.111+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"You really need to turtle in this situation. You said you were winning team fights on your nexus even when they had baron so I suggest that you keep turtling until you receive all your inhibs back. Then you will be able to start pushing out lanes again once you've won the next teamfight. It's basically about utilizing the time between winning the teamfight and the enemy respawn.","replies":[]}]}
