It was working perfectly fine until today.\r\n\r\nDuring the first game I've noticed my ping spiked up from 27 to more than a 1000 when we had a fight at dragon pit. The ping would go down as soon as I leave dragon. It happened during the second game as well (and sometimes during a teamfight, but the lag at dragon pit was very obvious).\r\n\r\nThe third game I had my client crashed after I finished loading at the loading screen. I reopened it and a message popped up saying an essential game data was missing: Twisted Fate. The patcher went on repairing and I was able to login just fine but soon crashing again with a new message saying there were corrupted files, so I did the repair again. It was made clear that a) I'd only lag whenever I do dragon with or without a fight and sometimes during a teamfight, and b) my league client kept crashing with bugsplat popping up. At the moment I'm trying to reinstall, only that it crashed three times in the middle of updating interface stage and I'm not sure what to do.\r\n\r\nI've looked up many threads and made sure I've got the latest version of Adobe flash player, java, DirectX, my graphic card driver... tried running the patcher as administrator, turned off my firewalls etc. I run every other games perfectly and league is the only one having troubles.\r\n\r\nNot quite sure if it is related, but my Google chrome crashed for the first time today not long before my league client crashed. I don't know if it was only a coincidence or the problems were actually related. It kept giving me this \"Aw, Snap!\" page and I reinstalled it. So far it hasn't have any crashes yet.\r\n\r\nIf anyone knows how to fix this please do help, it's annoying as hell! I really appreciate it, thanks!","replies":[{"poster":"HORSE OF FORCE","date":"2015-01-22T00:32:02.859+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":">a message popped up saying an essential game data was missing: Twisted Fate.\n\nDid you screen this? I've never seen a message so specific before.\n\n>only that it crashed three times\n\nHow so did it 'crash'? Was it that your OS brought up a message saying it stopped working, or the client itself said it? Or did the download rate drop to 0kbps?","replies":[{"poster":"Butter Toast","date":"2015-01-22T04:06:46.271+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Sorry I didn't screen it, but it happened during the loading screen and the enemy team had a twisted fate which turned to be a grey square.\n\nEvery time when the client crashed the bug splat always popped up with the whole client turned into a white background, so it's client itself said it.\n\nUPDATE:\n\nSo I uninstalled one of the Visual c++ that came with league and reinstalled the whole thing again. It worked. So far there isn't any crashes yet. But the problem with my ping spikes during dragon and even with baron is still here.\n\nUPDATE 2:\n\nI opened my client and the message saying corruption detected appeared again! Update went pretty smoothly but after that the client wouldn't open? And the only way to open it is to restart my computer.","replies":[{"poster":"HORSE OF FORCE","date":"2015-01-23T09:37:02.447+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Oh, so it wasn't a message saying \"You lost the TF files wtf\", it was just you making an observation. Lol.\n\nThe problem is internal. From this point, I'd say that something probably went wrong during it's initial installation, and that a re-installation should fix it. That seems to have worked.\n\nAbout your continued problems with being around Dragon or Baron, that is just strange. Are you sure it's your ping that's rising and not your FPS dropping?","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Butter Toast","date":"2015-01-23T00:22:28.316+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"UPDATE 3:\n\nThe client seems fine after I used the repair button after I reinstalled it, but there would corrupted files each time I opened it up .
