However, the ACMA may [restrict access](http://www.classification.gov.au/Public/Resources/Pages/Parents.aspx#6) to online content upon valid complaint, or under their own initiative.

After all I'm not a qualified lawyer, so it's very possible I might have missed something. Or alternatively you could also give the [Broadcasting Services Act](https://www.legislation.gov.au/Details/C2016C00519) a read.\n\nI hope that helps!","replies":[]}]}
