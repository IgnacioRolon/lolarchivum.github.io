Two figures leaned against the central workbench but for the longest time only drifting motes of dust shifted the air. Fiora studied her colleague&rsquo;s expression intently as he pored over the weapon he held. Her latest blade had captured Graves&rsquo; full attention.\n\n   &ldquo;A marvel,&rdquo; he murmured, before finally meeting her gaze. &ldquo;The craftsmanship is remarkable.&rdquo;\n   &ldquo;Very,&rdquo; she replied, a spark of pride glowing behind her words. \n\n   Graves&rsquo; eyebrow raised and he delicately set it down on the scarred workbench between them, lifting an eye to Fiora&rsquo;s satisfied gaze. She had hard blue eyes and a narrow face coming to sharp points at her nose and chin. Built like a willow switch &ndash; not dissimilar to the blade before him. He noticed Fiora&rsquo;s hands itched toward her opus, but she clasped them in her lap to prevent them from cradling it. &ldquo;That sword is the perfect extension of my will,&rdquo; the noblewoman declared.  \n\n   &ldquo;An iron will,&rdquo; Graves noted, a smirk tugging at the corner of his mouth. \n\n   Fiora&rsquo;s reply, came short and sharp &ndash; &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; her blue eyes pierced his brown ones. The humour drained from his face. His next words were sombre. \n\n   &ldquo;The link is between you is strong, Fiora, anyone could see that,&rdquo; he said, his eyes narrowing as her fidgeting hands finally drew the blade closer. &ldquo;Just&hellip; just make sure it doesn&rsquo;t change you. It&rsquo;s a clich&eacute;, I know&hellip; but don&rsquo;t let the way of Fiora become the, uh, the way of the sword.&rdquo; Fiora could see that he&rsquo;d chosen his words even more carefully than he would plan specifications for his next weapon. She laid the blade on the table with a note of finality, before looking him dead in the eye. \n\n   &ldquo;I hardly need reminding, Graves&hellip; but thank you. I do appreciate your concern.&rdquo; Fiora&rsquo;s expression became inquisitive. &ldquo;Before we become too melodramatic, aren&rsquo;t you forgetting something? Your own masterwork? You&rsquo;ve devoted more time to it than your wife &ndash; one would be forgiven for assuming you were courting a new fianc&eacute;e in your workshop. The kiss of hammer on steel is all I&rsquo;ve heard for a month. I think your bride-to-be has been veiled for quite long enough,&rdquo; she grinned, more than a little pleased by her light-hearted mockery. Graves&rsquo; eyes lit to the challenge and he rose to sweep aside his cloak with a showman&rsquo;s flourish, to reveal a curious contraption on his hip. The weapon, if indeed it was such, rested in a short leather sheath with only its curved oak grip protruding. It looked more like a peculiar dagger than a sword. He drew the&hellip; thing, revealing a hollow, foot-long cylinder of steel extending from an intricately worked mechanism at his hand. None of its edges looked remotely sharp; &ldquo;You spent a fine long time in that workshop to emerge triumphant, holding a club, Graves,&rdquo; her cavalier words only whispered. Cautiously, Fiora gained her feet. \n\n   &ldquo;This is no club, nor blade, nor bow. No &ndash; this is the future. This is the first of many. I call it a &lsquo;firearm&rsquo;.\n\n   &ldquo;A&hellip; firearm? What does it do?&rdquo; Apprehension coloured her voice but Graves, it seemed, didn&rsquo;t notice as he moved to the practice ring, where customers would typically take their first experimental swings with whichever blade had caught their eye. The area was cleared in a circle, except for a solitary scarred oak manikin in the centre. \n\n   &ldquo;Fiora, step back, if you will.&rdquo; Graves&rsquo; request drew a gruff laugh from Fiora but failed to move the noblewoman. Graves allowed a small smile to touch his lips. Firmly, he insisted, &ldquo;Fiora, take a step back. Trust me.&rdquo; Fiora remained sceptical, but grudgingly acquiesced. Graves raised the firearm to sight down the barrel. He looked ridiculous, quaintly pointing a glorified club at an oak dummy from a dozen feet away. What exactly did he expect to happen? \n\n   &ldquo;You do realise that that lump of wood isn&rsquo;t about to come to life and attack you, don&rsquo;t you? You don&rsquo;t have to keep an eye on it &ndash; it&rsquo;s not going anywhere.&rdquo; A grin played across her lips. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s finally happened, hasn&rsquo;t it? My esteemed friend and colleague has finally lost his &ndash; admittedly tenuous &ndash; grasp on sanity.&rdquo; She looked ready to continue in that vein but was silenced by an ear-splitting thunder as the firearm spat a tongue of fire and the head of the manikin exploded into splinters and memories. Fiora stumbled back, ears ringing but recovered her balance with a swordswoman&rsquo;s grace. Silence descended as the last shards of oak hit the ground. Graves stood, motionless as a statue, arm still extended. The moment stretched out, as leisurely as the wisp of smoke from the firearm&rsquo;s barrel, before drifting away, lost. Graves&rsquo; glassy eyes regained their focus and his arm slowly lowered. \n                                                                                                                   *** *** ***\nEzreal&rsquo;s echoing heartbeat was the only sound to break the midnight insect gossip. His eyes had long adjusted to the late hour. He&rsquo;d watched the last candle-flicker fade from The Edge&rsquo;s windowsills not fifteen minutes ago. The night was hot and the air hung heavy, damp and asleep. Carefully, so as not to wake it, Ezreal stole down the fire escape from his rooftop perch, dropping to the street below in practiced silence. At least it wasn't raining. He crossed the street casually but his nonchalant stance melted into a shadowed prowl when he attained the opposite sidewalk. \n\n   A narrow alley ran between The Edge and the neighbouring bakery. He slipped between the two. Where is it? It should be&hellip; here. His entry point materialised out of the darkness &ndash; the window was at head height. A glance through its pane revealed little - it was inky black inside the workshop. He tried the window gently &ndash; never overlook simplicity, as his mother had always said. It was locked, of course. He&rsquo;d brought lock picks, but they were less then useless against an interior latch. He wasn&rsquo;t known as the prodigal explorer for nothing, however. Ezreal shut his eyes, and subtly shifted the universe&hellip; When he opened his eyes, he was inside, a grin playing across his lips as he enjoyed the pure electricity of the moment. That chill down his spine was his raison d&#039;&ecirc;tre. \n\n   When floorboards and furniture were no longer strangers to his sight, Ezreal padded forwards softly, then FROZE. Ice filled his veins. Someone was in the workshop with him.\n\n   Ezreal stayed still &ndash; the figure was that close. Any sudden movement would mean certain discovery&hellip; A long moment passed. And another. \n\nHold on now&hellip; the thief uttered a muttered but heartfelt curse. The &lsquo;intruder&rsquo; was no more than a manikin. Nervous laughter threatened to reach his lips as the manikin sent a shiv of remembered frost through his blood when he approached it. He chuckled quietly, &ldquo;You belong in a m&hellip;&rdquo; He trailed off. The wooden neck ended in a splay of jagged splinters. Curious. It would have been a fine strike to obliterate the hardwood head of the target dummy. Rubbing a thumb over the shards of broken oak, a thought slowly surfaced. No sword or arrow would do this. Surely only a club or a mace would make such a&hellip; an impression. The Edge wasn&rsquo;t known for such blunt weaponry though, not at all, in fact. But no matter how he turned it in his head, all other possibilities required a laughably eccentric character bringing their own mace to test instore. Ridiculous. This was Demacia, not Piltover. Ezreal cast his eyes about the shadowed walls, unconsciously seeking an answer to his question &ndash; what on Runeterra could have inspired such destruction? If only he could lay hands on it, he had clients from Bilgewater to Bandle City who&rsquo;d pay a pretty Serpent for it&hellip; \n                                                                                                                        *** *** ***\nThe sheriff&rsquo;s cuffs clicked shut with a note of finality. &ldquo;So let me get this straight, Ezreal&hellip; you lined your pockets by selling these &lsquo;guns&rsquo; to notoriously shady characters across the land&hellip; and now you&rsquo;re concerned that I don&rsquo;t have the firepower to deal with the threat you created. This &lsquo;sniper rifle&rsquo; is your solution to arming terrorists like Jinx? You&rsquo;re as mad as Mundo.&rdquo; \n\n   A blush touched the young explorer&rsquo;s high cheekbones, &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t know what I was unleashing! You can&rsquo;t arrest me, Cait! Please! Doesn&rsquo;t giving you the rifle&hellip; average things out?&rdquo;\n\n   Caitlyn shouldered her new weapon. &ldquo;Boy, you're sadly mistaken if you think the long arm of the law is just going to give you a pat on the back and a shiny silver Serpent for spreading these instruments of violence across Valoran.\" Piltover's enforcer took a moment to gaze across the docks and gather her thoughts. \"My heart doesn't even want to accept this rifle, but my gut tells me that I'll need it in the times to come.\"\n\n\"So enjoy the sunshine while you can, boy.\" A bitter smile ghosted across Caitlyn's lips. \"I imagine that, just like you, Runeterra is savouring its last... average... day...\"","replies":[{"poster":"Oneechan","date":"2016-07-10T22:55:49.902+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Oh wow nice introduction to the firearm :D \n\"You spent a fine long time in that workshop to emerge triumphant, holding a club, Graves.\" This line made me laugh. Very interesting interactions between Fiora and Graves. It's like they were supposed to be friends all along!\nPersonally, I'd rather have read more on these two than on Ez and Cait, because their story reads like a different story than the one you started off with (there's so much there to explore with Fiora x Graves and it's a shame you didn't go further with them). But that's not to say the rest of the story was bland. Thoroughly enjoyed this one :D","replies":[{"poster":"CourtJesster","date":"2016-07-19T04:14:50.309+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thank you so much for reading this!!!
