Because pinging danger or be careful just doesn't have the same effect and can confuse team mates. \n\nOf course another solution to this would be an in-game voice system which would help with more than just the warded bush problem, it would allow team mates to make calls and give advice, and more, without having to stand AFK for a while whilst typing.{{item:2050}}","replies":[{"poster":"Dracuula","date":"2016-05-18T11:12:15.036+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I still don't understand why LoL doesn't have an in-game voice chat feature for maybe ranked play? I get normals but I feel ranked games with voice would be great.\n\nAlot of the people who flame/are toxic would be too scared to use the mic to say stuff to people anyway.","replies":[{"poster":"Narwhal","date":"2016-05-18T11:49:29.845+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"maybe,  but it also means they can say it and never get caught because there is no proof","replies":[]}]}]}
