I&#039;ve been practicing lane and jungle but I usually end up dying A LOT. I&#039;m not very good with games and it usually takes me a while for me to actually play well. Do you have any suggestions on how to play better and with better builds?","replies":[{"poster":"Captain Fortune","date":"2017-03-10T09:08:12.230+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"**Greetings DragoFang Blaze,**\n\nFirstly welcome to league! I have a few bits of advice that might help you out, having also played a decent amount of Shyvana myself. **The main thing** to keep in mind is you are still new to the game, so keep seeking advice and improving and you'll keep getting better ^^\n\n---\n\n**Reducing Deaths**\n\nTo answer your main question about reducing deaths, this can be a difficult question to answer because there are so many causes of deaths in league, however the main thing is that often a death comes from either over estimating what you are able to do in a fight, or under estimating your opponent. \n\nWith that in mind, when you do die try to think back to what happened and think about what you can learn from the situation to improve for next time. If you keep doing this you will expand your game knowledge about your champions limits and be able to take fights you know you can win.\n\n---\n\n**Focus on improving basic mechanics**\n\nThe other piece of advice I would give you is try to focus on the basic mechanics and improving on them. These are things such as Minion Kills, Jungle Pathing, Trading with your opponent in lane or team fighting with many more.\n\nI would recommend picking one part of your gameplay, _you already mentioned your death count and that may be a good one to start with_, and focus on improving on that area. Once you have improved there, you can move onto another until you build up your mechanics. \n\n---\n\n**Builds**\n\nNow how to build better is one of the things that you mentioned, what I personally recommend to people is finding a build that works well with your playstyle and is a \"cookie-cutter\" based build. Meaning that it will work well in a lot of different situations. If you build like this then once you have improved your mechanics such as Trading and Jungle Pathing for example, you can expand into situation item building.\n\n_If you want some examples of how to go about this feel free to ask!_\n\n---\n\n**Other Tips**\n\nOne of the other pieces of advice is that try to focus on the basics that can be transferred over to other champions. Shyvana can do some really cool things, but before you focus on all the little techniques that she has I would recommend focusing on things all champions can take advantage of. That way if you're in a situation where you can't play Shyvana you can use those mechanics you learned.\n\n_This isn't to say you can't learn those techniques, I would just recommend focusing on some other things for now, and then moving onto those once your mechanics have built up._\n\n---\n\n**Wrapping up**\n\nHope this information helps! If there is any other questions I can answer or anything I can expand upon that I mentioned let me know. Good luck in your games and enjoy your adventures out there in the league.\n\n~Elam","replies":[{"poster":"DragoFang Blaze","date":"2017-03-10T09:45:21.369+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thank you very much for your help Elam. I am wondering if you could suggest any good builds for Shyvana lane and jungle as that is what I've been practicing with my friends. Again thank you for your advice.","replies":[{"poster":"Captain Fortune","date":"2017-03-11T01:16:40.510+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"**Greetings again DragoFang Blaze,**\n\nSince you are playing Shyvana both jungle and top lane I thought I would highlight two main builds I would suggest on her, along with some items that you could swap in or out depending on what you find works best with your playstyle.\n\n---\n\n# Top lane\n{{item:3748}} {{item:3143}} {{item:3156}} {{item:3068}} {{item:3742}} {{item:3111}} \nFor top lane I would suggest experimenting firstly with these items, giving you a good balance of damage and tank stats. However when you are building the items its good to know the reasons behind it to learn why it does or doesn't work for you:\n\n* **Titanic Hydra**\nTitanic works great as a starting item because it will give you damage to trade in lane and start to give you some tanky stats. Along with that the active item works brilliantly in team fights for hitting multiple targets.\n\n\n* **Randuin's Omen** \nRanduins is one of my favourite items on Shyvana, since she lacks any form of slow or stun to stay on her targets, the active slows down your enemies to help you stick onto them.\n\n\n* **Maw of Malmortius**\nMaw is a great item for a good balance between magic resist and damage with a unique passive that will help you deal with enemy mages giving you a shield when you take magic damage under a certain amount of HP. Often a Hexdrinker is rushed as first item vs an AP opponent. \n\n\n* **Sunfire Cape**\n_Who doesn't love more fire as a dragon?_ Real talk, more tanky stats plus a passive that does AOE damage helping you in team fights for when you dive into the enemy team working really well with your W.\n\n\n* **Dead Man's Plate**\n_MOAR tanky stats_ with a passive that not only helps you chase down enemies but deal damage to them as well, fitting well with Shyvana's playstyle and kit.\n\n\n* **Mercury's Treads**\nMercury's Treads is my favourite boot choice for Shyvana giving you Tenacity helping you do more in team fights and giving you a small boost to the amount of magic resist that you have.\n\n#Jungle\n{{item:1416}}  {{item:3153}} {{item:3143}} {{item:3065}} {{item:3068}} {{item:3111}}  \nThese are the items I would suggest you pick up for Jungle and the reasoning behind them:\n\n* **Stalker's Blade - Bloodrazer**\nThis is my go to smite/enchant when I am jungling as Shyvana. Giving you attack speed and giving you % max health damage on enemy targets, helping you deal with tanks or doing just that extra bit more damage to their back line.\n\n\n* **Blade of the Ruined King**\nThis is one of the best damage items to build on Shyvana in my opinion, giving life steal to work well with the Spirit Visage mentioned later in the build and doing % health damage helping you deal with tanks in team fights if you find yourself attacking them. \n\n\n* **Randuin's Omen** \n_Refer to top lane section, I will say pretty much the same thing here._\n\n\n* **Spirit Visage**\nAs mentioned not only does this work well with Blade of the Ruined King increasing how much you heal for, it gives you some much needed MR for those AP champions you have to deal with.\n\n\n* **Sunfire Cape** and **Mercury's Treads**\n_Refer to the top lane section for my notes on these._\n\n---\n\n# Other items to consider\n{{item:3026}} {{item:3022}} {{item:1419}} {{item:3047}} {{item:3053}} \nThese are some other items that you might want to experiment with and see if you like them to swap them in/out of your build to fit your playstyle.\n\n* **Guardian Angel** \nThis is a really fun item to build because once the enemy team has killed you once, now they have to kill you again for 30% of your max HP. This item is often best used though when at least one other member of your team has a GA, as if you die and revive after your team is already dead, it can often be a bit of a waste of a 5 minute cooldown.\n\n\n* **Frozen Mallet**\nThis is a popular choice among Shyvana players giving a slow on auto attacks and giving some much needed tank stats. The reason I haven't recommended it in my builds is just because I personally prefer other items over it, but you may enjoy it, so give it a shot.\n\n\n* **Skirmisher's Sabre - Bloodrazer**\nThis is an alternate to taking Chilling Smite and is usually taken if you feel like you can stick on your targets without the need of the slow. If you are able to do this it will equal more damage in the end with Skirmisher's Sabre giving you more damage to the target you smite.\n\n\n* **Ninja Tabi**\nAlternative choice to Mercury's Treads, in my opinion this is situation depending on the game, but if you are vsing someone for example such as a Vayne that does a lot of auto attack damage, this might be worth considering picking up.\n\n\n* **Sterak's Gage**\nThis is one of the new items on the block for Shyvana and one that has seen a decent amount of popularity. Giving some health, attack speed and a passive that gives you a shield, letting you live longer to deal more damage. The downside being is if you don't already have some tanky items, the shield can be destroyed pretty fast.\n\n---\n\nHope this information on items helps! I thought I would go in depth so you can learn a bit more about the inner workings of all the items and why people might recommend them. If you have any other questions or any items you want me to comment on that I have mentioned here let me know! Good luck in your games!\n\n~Elam\n\n_P.S. If you wanted to add me for some normal games some time, feel free to do so. I can give you advice as we go._","replies":[{"poster":"DragoFang Blaze","date":"2017-03-11T01:37:21.274+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thanks! I've actually been trying these items when I play her. I've been playing against my friend who used Lux against me. I've been improving my escaping and tanking (we were playing 1v1 Howling Abyss) because using warmog's armour against him was amazing. I believe there should be some method of cool-down so I usually use Black Cleaver or Ionian Boots which is amazing. If you could take a look at my builds in my match history and see what would be much better choices that would be great. Again thanks! :)","replies":[{"poster":"Captain Fortune","date":"2017-03-13T11:58:20.419+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Greetings again DragoFang Blaze,\n\nYea Black Cleaver can be great for getting some cooldown reduction however I would suggest going for something other than it unless you are going a more damage oriented build. Black Cleaver thrives off of champions that spend a lot of time auto attacking champions with high damage, and Shyvana _can_ fill this role, but only if she already has a few damage items which can make her very easy to kill in team fights.\n\nIf you are still craving some cooldown reduction in your builds though you could look into something such as a **Spirit Visage**. This not only gives you tanky stats but will also gives you the cooldown reduction you are after.\n\n---\n\nAs for looking over your match history for Shyvana builds apart from the Black Cleaver note I made I think they look good. However I suggest swapping out your boots for something more tanky as you will need it to survive big team fights in the mid-late game.\n\nThe important part is experimenting with different items and finding out what works best for you and what works best in certain situations. Such as if they are building a lot of AP getting some magic resist items for example. But sticking to a \"cookie-cutter\" build that covers most situations is what I would recommend for now. So experiment and see what you find works the best ^^\n\n_If you are looking for more items to add to the build or ones to try out for Shyvana, feel free to refer to my previous reply._\n\n---\n\nHope this helps!
