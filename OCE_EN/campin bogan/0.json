The Q can lock on and throw 2 knives at one enemy and the third will hit another that is close by.\nW is a passive ability that increases movement speed greatly with each lvl up and the active doubles it. The E allows u to jump off enemies up to 5 times slowing enemies hit (sort of a mix between Akali and Kalista. The R is a global ult similar to talons e it allows u to teleport behind any enemy in the map that is not hidden by the fog of war and then go invisible for 1-3 second depending on the rank of the skill. Lastly the passive increases life steal by 1% each lvl up going up to 20% at lvl 18 (starts at 2%). Please Comment and let me know what you think of my idea or if you can think of ways to improve it.","replies":[{"poster":"Pemi","date":"2015-01-16T04:02:16.868+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'm not even sure where to start. So the champ is an ADC:\n1) ADC's are supposed to stay at max range otherwise they get pummelled into oblivion.  This champions ULT would pretty much put them exactly where they shouldn't be and any attempt to use it would be suicidal.\n2) The mix of the Lifesteal passive and both the passive and active speed bonuses of the W would make this champion absolutely unstoppable mid to late game.\n3) The E seems somewhat confusing. So you jump from champion to champion like Akali, again putting an ADC exactly where he/she doesn't want to be, while also slowing the champion hit.\n\nTo be honest it was a pretty weak try but next time you have a champion idea, which I'm sure you will, take some time to think about kit synergy instead of just *themed* abilities.","replies":[{"poster":"Campin Bogan","date":"2015-01-16T10:50:51.556+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"The e would make u bounce off the champion so i guess similar to what quinn does in a way but you can direct the direction and bounce between multiple enemies.  Also the ult lets u go invis for 1-3 seconds depending on rank of the skill as mentioned so yes there is some risk with it can be advantageous. Thank you for your advice i will remember to put more thought into the kit synergy next time","replies":[{"poster":"Juju fancIub","date":"2015-01-17T01:49:58.505+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Wouldn't bouncing around use alot of energy? even if this is a mana using champ (I assume since its a ninja adc, he/she would be using energy) that would cost alot of energy and time and for what? a slow on multiple targets? If this really is an adc why do most of he attacks put her into melee range? this would be better as a bruiser with Q as poke and alot of tanky items imo. Terrible adc champ, probably better as jungle / mid or top.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Wobbettin","date":"2015-01-16T11:08:03.700+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Why would you want to bounce off multiple times like a ping pong ball?
