You must have hit inactivity limit and it marked you as the leaver. According to your match history in that game you were still level 1 when it ended, as well as having done no damage. For the remake option to actually become possible, someone in your game would have had to been marked as AFK during the first 3 minutes. All indications point to it being you (even if you became active/reconnected as or just after the /remake became available). \n\nI am unsure about the demotion aspect to it, although it usually means your MMR was not up to a silver 1 standard (in fact, it would have to be quite below if you still had some LP before 0 when you demoted).","replies":[]}]}
