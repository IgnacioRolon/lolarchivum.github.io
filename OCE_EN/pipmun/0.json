Her Q does a lot of damage along with her ult if she is able to get all of the volleys off it without getting interrupted.\n\nHowever the disadvantage in MF comes in, as previously mentioned her lack of self peel in an escape or a hard CC, along with her quite heavily relying on hitting her Q bounces unless she is fed to do damage in lane. With this in mind when you think about her Q bounce and watch for it while in lane it can be pretty easy to dodge if you don't mirror her movements. Along with this getting your ult off without it getting cancelled on all the targets you want to can be quite difficult. Plus the recent nerfs to duskblade have made my personal favourite MF build not as effective anymore.\n\n---\n\nThe other thing to note would be team comps, both with what MF is vsing and what she has on her team. Champions that can set up for her ult well and protect her from being canceled work great with MF, a great example of this would be Nami. Able to set up well for MF ult with her Wave and Bubble, able to peel extremely well, and getting off a Q bounce is always fun when you have Nami's E on you for that extra damage and the slow. \n\nAs for champions that MF struggles against. Champions that can get onto her easily and do damage fast in this Asssassin meta can be a real pain for her. Great examples are Zed or Akali, without peel or MF being fed, its almost impossible for MF to deal with these champions when they get on top of her. Along with this tanks who are easily able to cancel her ult can be a real pain such as Malphite, Maokai and Cho'Gath.\n\n---\n\nMF does have her advantages though and many ways to play her. Personally I have my [own rune page that I run on her that gives me a ton of leathality](http://i.imgur.com/7pZmU1L.png) both from my marks and my quints. This gives me a lot of damage once I get my dusk blade and IE off of a q bounce and can be quite fun to play. With this in mind I am able to play her sometimes as an assassin of sort if I am fed being able to do a ton of damage to squishy targets. Along with this as previously mentioned while it is hard to do, getting off a full ult can be extremely satisfying.\n\n---\n\nI hope that this helps, I am curious what your thoughts are on the points that I have brought up. If you have any questions about MF as well feel free to let me know, she is currently my highest mastery champion.\n\n~Elam","replies":[{"poster":"Pipmun","date":"2017-01-08T05:16:04.488+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thanks for the advice and your tips, this helped me a lot","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Nightjar","date":"2017-01-07T23:28:17.318+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I feel the prominence of assassins, specifically ones with stealth or high mobility, does a good job of keeping her in check since compared to most other adcs she isn't very mobile nor does she have much cc.

OFC its comp reliant but if you have good initiators like Malph Braum J4 she can shred enemies that are confined to an area.\n\nI think her power is capped by her lack of mobility and her reliance on peel, more than any adc with a dash. And her laning phase is dependent on positioning to hit those double ups and is fairly weak to ganks.","replies":[{"poster":"Nightjar","date":"2017-01-08T23:36:21.145+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"if the enemy assassin has half a brain, the moment you ult, you're dead in the water, especially since your support can't just drop a pink ward anymore, and getting a 5man knockup and mf ult combo properly in any elo above bronze is difficult. \nLucian ult is just better given the way the game is right now and the assassin meta (you can say it's tank meta all you want, but I'm far more afraid of a decent khazix or rengar jungle than I am of a decent olaf or volibear).\n\nShe's a lane bully but without pink wards, it's actually pretty easy to camp her and her range is pretty short meaning that like you've said she's going to need some A-grade peel to not just get picked off or 1 shot by a khazix and she'll get outpoked by ranged adcs in grouped fights.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"BarryButcher","date":"2017-01-07T22:36:24.577+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"She is strong but has very clear weaknesses that are exploitable.","replies":[]},{"poster":"CHEESYLEEKS","date":"2017-01-07T21:44:19.899+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"no .... just no","replies":[]}]}
