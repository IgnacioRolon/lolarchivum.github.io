Asol, Urgot, Kled, Yorick, Rengar, Illaoi and Evelynn all got uninspired and lazy skins, just because they're not played very much. Aurelion and Urgot especially. If you want to counter my Lazy argument, I direct you to the furnace on High noon urgot, and the colors on Mecha Asol's default. I think Super galaxy kindred was the same, not sure though, doesn't look good at all and I rarely see it when people play Kindred.","replies":[]}]}]}
