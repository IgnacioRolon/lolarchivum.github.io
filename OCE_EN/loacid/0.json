Fair enough. Why are {{item:3303}} and {{item:3098}} still buyable if the item they end up becoming is not? Just seems like it could cause a fair bit of frustration for the less attentive players out there that could easily be saved by simply disabling the other items unique to that build path.","replies":[{"poster":"BarryButcher","date":"2015-08-08T08:37:48.444+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"If you are playing someone like Bard who would buy the spellthiefs and never upgrade it, i think its fine.\n\nThere are many champions that never upgrade to the full item so makes sense to not disable all of them","replies":[]}]}
