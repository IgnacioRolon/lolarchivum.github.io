I guess the two places with pertinent info would be:\n\n1. My Computer/This PC (depending on windows version) > Right click in an empty space in the folder > Properties > Note your Processor and amount of RAM.\n\n2. Your graphics card, if you're running an nvidia card, Right Click on the Desktop > Nvidia Control Panel > System Information (bottom left of the panel) > Note what graphics card you have under Items. If you have an AMD card I'd have no idea how to find that information.\n\nI don't need compensation for anything, I do this just because I like to :) I'm also not a tech person, just grew up arounnd computers so my knowledge is fairly limited. I will say though that as far as games go League is pretty low spec compatible. You don't even need all that beefy of a machine to run everything on ultra. \n\nGood with PCs is relative to what you actually want to do with them. My PC is far above average for gaming, but there are other things my PC wouldn't be considered good enough for. I've honestly struggled more with asking too much of my PC and Photoshop than I have with any game :P","replies":[{"poster":"carrypuss","date":"2018-02-21T04:17:46.879+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"how do i put the pictiures in here","replies":[{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2018-02-21T05:07:12.023+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You can screenshot with snipping tool (just hit Start and type in snipping tool and it'll come up it's windows standard) then copy that image onto a site like imgur (https://imgur.com/).\n\nYou don't need screenshots though if you just wanna write down what it says.
