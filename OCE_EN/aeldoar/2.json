I only play normals/aram but am sick of getting the same people who just troll around and not actually try for the objective.","replies":[{"poster":"TTL Rem","date":"2018-07-30T18:40:24.056+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hiya :)\n\nI get your frustration. Unfortunately, all you can do is report them and hope for the best.\n\nThe main reason for this is due to player size and queue time. Riot doesn't want players waiting an hour in queue just for a game. Sure, the effects of blocking every single toxic Bronze may be minimal (since there are *thousands* of them). To this extent it seems reasonable. The problem gets harder the higher up the ladder you go. At around mid-Diamond+ (at least in OCE), you'll most likely be recognising almost everyone in your games due to the few people at that MMR (only about 1,500 or so). If all these players start blocking others, queue times will sky-rocket for them, and after a long time place them either with players far above their MMR or far below. This effect exponentiates the higher you go.\n\nThis could also be abusable. Imagine if every Master/Challenger blocks the Rank 1 player. Due to the obscene queue times and MMR difference when they finally *do* get a game, not only would they have an extremely skewed LP gain (+3 / -30, for example), but they also would struggle to meet the 10-game quota for Challenger, and hence just decay out. And even then, they'd have super long queue times since decay doesn't affect MMR, just LP. Heck! The game would be so ruined for them, they may as well make a smurf.\n\nRemember: it's not just affecting the person you block; it affects *everyone*. And when all those other people also block others, then the game will just seize up.\n\nHope this helps :D\n{{sticker:sg-ahri-2}}","replies":[]},{"poster":"NotSoMLG","date":"2018-08-05T16:00:17.932+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"if there were a way to do this but without increasing queue times it would be great. like a preference system.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Aeldoar","date":"2018-07-31T10:58:51.903+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I understand the idea of them being blocked in rank is an issue..
