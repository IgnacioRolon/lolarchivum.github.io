I would like to be able to block certain people from matching with them in these \"fun game modes\" and also with this giving me a longer queue so those people I don't wish to play with can still play but just not with myself. I understand that this would have implications for ranked...but am asking for only queues that don't have any impact on ranked!","replies":[{"poster":"Aeldoar","date":"2019-08-15T07:58:04.911+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"But that's not at all an issue.. there is no weight in normal's at all, blocking people from queueing into your game gives you no benefit other than not having people in your game that make you hate playing the game! If the game supports people who just troll/play bad for fun than it should also offer something to stop people joining my game that makes me hate playing it..","replies":[]},{"poster":"TSM Swish","date":"2019-08-13T01:49:00.796+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It would get abused, people would block everyone who had a negative K/D ratio to try and always be on a winning team.","replies":[]}]}
