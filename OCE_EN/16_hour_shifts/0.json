I just want people with differing opinions to tell me their views. The subject is video game companies that do \"things\" which a lot of people don't agree with. \r\nOne example is \"microtransactions\" \r\nDO NOT CONFUSE THIS WITH PAY - TO - WIN \r\nI have seen recently many many people across multiple platforms complaining (to the point of completely disregarding a game company on this basis) about microtransactions and how they are ruining the industry. \r\nHow would anyone have an issue with this? In any way? At all? \r\nAgain, do not confuse this with pay to win. \r\nI have more questions if anyone answers this one.

The systems used with them are designed to constantly push players into spending money, usually through \"barely fun\" mechanics (such as forced waiting), and then giving players the option to pay to make it \"more fun\" (such as paying to remove waiting times), and are most common with mobile games.\n\nThe reason it's so effective at generating profit is because the purchases are of such a low value that it's difficult for people to keep track of how much they're actually spending across multiple purchases, and then platforming that off people who suffer from, or are at risk of, addiction means they don't even need to worry about the vast majority of users (which usually results in other problems being ignored or created by the producers/developers).\n\nYou don't get such issues with \"macro-transactions\" though, because the purchases are of a sufficient value that the average user is able to keep reliable track of how much they are actually spending, but even with that kind of payment system there are ways for publishers to platform off addiction for profit, the primary example of that being lootboxes.\n\nWhile lootboxes share the same fundamental concept of micro-transactions, they differ in how they are used. One thing that makes lootboxes so useful for publishers is that they can be used effectively with macro-transaction systems, and they're generally easier to trigger addiction with because of the way they are used, with publishers being able to make lengthened, flashy animations for opening them (consider, for example, LoL's Hextech Crafting system). Lootboxes also provide publishers an easier way to give away \"free samples\" to help those systems trigger addiction in *more* users than if they were purely \"purchase only\".\n\nWhen all is said and done, the current state of the video game industry is that there exists an issue of \"overuse\" with these kinds of systems, with some publishers flooding their games with as much as they can (I'd say LoL is the most readily available example of that), and even actively targeting these \"essentially gambling\" systems at underage users (for example; LoL, Fortnite, Apex Legends etc).","replies":[{"poster":"16 hour shifts","date":"2019-10-26T09:16:54.403+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Ahhhhh yo man, thanks heaps for that. Makes much more sense. \nI come from the proper outback, so I don’t understand a lot of financial issues, such as gambling. No idea why people would willingly throw away cash. \n\nTo me it always just looked as though a business was trying to make money, as would you and I if we started a business. I guess people get caught up in the “free” part about it.","replies":[{"poster":"Ąngel","date":"2019-11-27T10:38:37.375+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Just to throw a little tidbit in here.. I've been playing league for about 7 years. I'm currently 19 so I was around 12 or 13 when I first started playing. In 2013 alone I purchased 54 skins. \nOver the years breaking away from league has been fairly challenging purely because I've spent so much money on it. When a new skin comes out for a champion I'm playing frequently, I'll think \"what's 15 dollars?\" so I'll get it.. and just add to the hundreds of dollars I've spent on this darn game, making the guilt I'd feel for leaving it even worse.\n\nIf I had been an adult when I started playing It probably would have made dropping league easier, but instead the hundreds of dollars I used were from my parents. So that adds more fuel to the fire.\n\nTo specify, I am still enjoying league. In the past though I've become so utterly frustrated with losing elo in ranked that I wanted to quit.. and did for a while. But there's always that pull to come back to it.","replies":[]}]}]}]}
