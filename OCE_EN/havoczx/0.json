All 5 laptops could not open the client with all of them showing the RADs Error report &quot;could not connect to the HTTP servers&quot;.\n\nI quickly did research and troubleshooted all computers and my router to make sure it was not a local issue.\nTurns out it wasn&#039;t.\n\nAfter trouble shooting, I changed my DNS server from my ISP default server to Google&#039;s open dns servers 8.8.8.8 and 8.8.4.4. Without doubt it worked.\nAlthough we were able to log on to the client again, we received unstable pings. Guessing that it is because we are using a public DNS server. I also performed various ipconfig /flushdns commands and they do not seem to be the issue.\n\nhttp://imgur.com/a/2dcmo\n\nI am currently using TPG&#039;s unlimited data plan which enables me to use various sites like youtube, google, etc. however it is just the riot oce server i cannot connect to.  In addition, i cannot connect to riots webauth webpage as well using my ISP&#039;s dns. As of now i am using google's 8.8.8.8 dns to report this issue. However, i can still access other websites with no problem. Everyone in my household is experiencing this issue.\n\nIn the link there is a group of photos showing my tracerts to lq.oc1.lol.riotgames.com and chat.oc1.lol.riotgames.com.\nI hope that riot quickly resolves this issue between TPG&#039;s dns servers and Riot&#039;s Servers. \n\nCurrently i have to result to OpenDNS and Google&#039;s opendns servers which give me an unstable ping and some packet loss. Latency and packet loss issues did not occur before TPG&#039;s dns servers refused to connect to riot&#039;s servers.\n\n\nI hope this issue will be resolved soon\n\nThanks","replies":[{"poster":"Ryan864","date":"2017-06-15T13:45:22.074+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"For any others who is using TPG, here is what i experienced.

It is more than likely an issue in your local network configuration or something on your ISP's end.\n\nCould you do the following for me.\n\n* [Download WinMTR](https://sourceforge.net/projects/winmtr/files/WinMTR-v092.zip/download) and run a traceroute to the following IP.
