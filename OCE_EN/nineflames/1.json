Most of the game, nobody was saying anything until my Hecarim and Shaco (Who I&#039;m rather sure are premade as they were offering to skype one another) started flaming me for getting caught out, I ignored them, but soon after they told the enemy team that I was \"talking **** about them\".\n\nWhat I&#039;m asking is how the reports work, because I&#039;m afraid that due to the lack of a tribunal, when a player gets numerous reports, they get warned/suspended/banned. I have a feeling that there was a mutual decision to report me between the Pre-made players as there would be no reason for anybody else to be reporting me that game...\n\nNot saying that I&#039;m never rude, but it was after this game, where I did nothing wrong that I was issued the warning.\n\nThanks\n\nEdit - This may or may not be in the wrong category","replies":[{"poster":"HORSE OF FORCE","date":"2015-06-01T04:33:05.490+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"We have no correct category for things like this. The Help & Support boards are probably the best place to post this, if you must.\n\nBut, there are explicit instructions.\n\n>**DO NOT** post content regarding account suspensions here. [Submit a ticket](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/requests/new) instead.\n\nI'm not 100% sure if this applies to discussion about penalties/warnings as well, but I still do think that making a support ticket is a better option. It's not like anyone here can actually help you with this; you're better off getting a red bot to help you.\n\nHeads up, the 'marker' for your 'offensive language' won't be removed from your account. In other words, you need only a few more reports to encounter a penalty now, if not just one more.","replies":[{"poster":"Nineflames","date":"2015-06-02T12:34:56.181+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thanks for the reply and heads up, I'll make sure to keep them in mind, as I am new to the boards, if you hadn't noticed already.

The boards were made so that players could get help with the more menial problems they're having with the game, such as the client crashing upon opening or little bugs and glitches that have quick-fixes found for them (practical ones, like the S_OK file creation).\n\nFor issues concerning accounts, such as RP, suspensions, punishments and their appeals, you want to submit a support ticket. If you wanted to know the policies for such things, you can always ask here on the boards. Just keep in mind we aren't Riot employees.","replies":[]}]}]}]}
