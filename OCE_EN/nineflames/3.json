For this set of missions, I have a mission asking me to WIN 3 games with 8 ASSISTS minimum for each. This is really painful, as I&#039;m a solo laner and a Darius main. This means that I have to abstain from kills as much as possible, and focus on roaming instead of winning my lane. I could wait for teamfights, but 8 assists are more difficult to get and especially when you need 8 of them... for 3 games... that you have to win...\r\n\r\nSo I finally finished that mission, and it gets replaced with a new one - Get 50 ASSISTS. Now I know that playing a support with some sort of aura or buff could easily fulfill this in probably 3 games minimum, but I was under the impression that I should be able to play how I want, and still complete missions without spending an excessive amount of time. \r\n\r\nMy main gripe is that by specifying assists, it forces me to abstain from getting the kill. It actually gives me reason to not kill the enemy. I would suggest instead of assists/kills - Riot could just make it &quot;Get [X] kill participations&quot; and just bump the number up a bit. This makes it viable for solo laners and any type of player to complete the mission and they can choose how they play. Sure you could aruge the &quot;variety&quot; of missions goes down a bit, but having one mission mention kills and another assists doesn&#039;t really add to the enjoyability to begin with.","replies":[]}
