I love lore of games, dark souls, witcher, etc and the fact that Renekton was my first main made me pretty interested.\r\n\r\nNow with the &quot;Bloodlines&quot; story released and Nasus&#039; resolve to return Renekton to his past glory, I know it won&#039;t be any time soon... But do you think that if that ever happens in the lore, they will change Renekton. I know his abilities etc are in no position/need for a rework but maybe his current quotes and a renaming of his passive (fury) into something similar centered around his prowess as a warrior (as it has been mentioned he is a legendary fighter) could happen instead. I have always wanted to see Renekton &quot;renewed&quot; upon reading about his corruption from Xerath, and it would be amazing to see it happen.","replies":[]}
