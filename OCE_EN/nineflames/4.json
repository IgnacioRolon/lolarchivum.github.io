Please check the logs for more information.&quot; Activity Monitor says that UserKernel is not responding if that adds anything to the discussion.\r\n\r\nI tried deleting &quot;lol_air_client&quot; and &quot;lol_air_client_config_oc1&quot; from the RADS &gt; projects folder and they&#039;re in my trash but starting League up again doesn&#039;t replace them or make it work. I also tried deleting the &quot;solutions&quot; folder in &quot;RADS&quot; as well and the same thing happened, except it was replaced by an empty &quot;solutions&quot; folder.\r\n\r\nIf anybody has any suggestions I could try to get League working again, that&#039;d be great,\r\n\r\nThanks, Nineflames","replies":[{"poster":"Nineflames","date":"2015-06-25T07:07:36.470+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Well... there you go.
