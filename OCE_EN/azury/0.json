It sucks having a bad player on your team, especially when they're just objectively bad, but what gives them any less right to play this game than you?\n\nYou mention role calls, so presumably this is blind pick and not ranked, so why does it matter if he is bad? You can't win every game, what's the point in making yourself and your team miserable for it? Why should someone have to play their best champions/roles in normals just to appease you?\n\nOther than a few choice comments your chat isn't all that *severe* but it is *consistent*. It seems as if the Jhin may have been negative as well, but \"two wrongs don't make a right\" is a cliche for a reason.\n\nFrom this chat alone, I don't think a permanent suspension was warranted, but this chat alone does not account for your history, which the system does. Those with a history of negative behaviour get much less leniency than a player that has never been validly reported before, so if you've had a 14 day ban before, I can see why this was escalated to perma.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Essembie","date":"2017-11-21T22:04:45.811+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Sp0okyDisco,realm=OCE,application-id=T8eq2lFQ,discussion-id=dcLgREb4,comment-id=0003,timestamp=2017-11-14T09:46:35.978+0000)\n>\n> The player might of been &quot;Bad&quot; but calling them a spastic is where I would say you crossed the line making fun of some one by comparing them to some one with mental disabilities is never ok, The jhin might of also been toxic but in this case you clearly weren&#x27;t  the better person\n\nBut is it really bannable?","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Essembie","date":"2017-11-14T08:12:35.583+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"The mods in the player behaviour team are a bit overzealous with the banhammer at the moment by the sound of it.

Saying the player can't speak English is because he had broken grammar and could not physically form a proper sentence and also how is it my fault if we both speak different languages? (Which we don't, this player could speak English) the fact is thisis more of a competitive game now and it is very frustrating when someone can't communicate.\n\nNot only that but what about everything the other player belittled me for? Like I said, the chat log doesn't record the proper context of the conversation. The reason for this post ( and hwy I think this ban is unjustified) is because the ticket from Riot called me \"extremely inflammatory\", I don't know about you but I have seen and reported player who are far worse than me and they have gotten away without punishment.\n\nMe calling out this player and telling him what to do? where? I tell him he is build wrong because plain and simple his build was wrong, he hadn't built Jihn in the most optimal way to capitalize on his strengths, and once again this play was toxic towards ME, he was the one who continued to be toxic instead of just saying that he doesn't appreciate my comments and could I please stop, no.
