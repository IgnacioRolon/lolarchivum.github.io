In most, there were major lag spikes; but the last game I had, it was terrible.\r\n\r\nI do not quit a game unless it is a serious emergency. I am player who has experience much to know what responsibility is and be patient with players who are equally responsible.\r\nI have no time to troll or make others miserable, I know how it feels like. If others intend to do that to me, I am patient enough to ride out and finish a game with people like them, still doing my best to win the match; eventually life does the same to them till they learn not to do the same to others.\r\n\r\nIf I chat in game, it is due to the fact that the nerves on my fingers are fine enough to do it; if not, I rather focus my attention on doing my best to win a game. And I am sure you have encounter people of certain types that no matter what you say to them, they have no mental capacity to comprehend and remain not understanding. Why waste time chatting with people like them. Let life be their teacher instead.\r\n\r\nMy point here is, the LeaveBuster Warning I received is unjust.\r\nIf I have to accept it regardless, I have to accept it then that the direction society is going and that direction is what is encouraged. At the receiving end of those who contributed, on their own personal level, they have been answered; it is just that many have been busy pointing the finger at others and fail to take a good look at their own behavior.\r\n\r\nI am a really busy individual and I do not really like spending too much time on the forums. I rather use my time playing a good game.","replies":[{"poster":"IngÃ©nue","date":"2016-03-03T12:32:36.276+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Your major lag and inability to move probably caused the _automated_ leaver buster system to trigger. \nUnfortunately, this happens sometimes. The fact that you have been placed in a low priority queue suggests that this is a regular occurrence for you (also backed up by your lag commentary). Even though playing with this kind of lag may be ok for you, it is really frustrating to have players in games who cant move due to lag/ have beyond potato reaction times and end up dying a lot. \n\nI would suggest taking the time to sort out what is causing you to lag out, whether it be your computer needed an upgrade, or your internet, before playing more PVP games. \n\nSending a ticket to support in this case will not do anything for you as they do not remove players from LPQ under **any** circumstances.\n\n> CAN YOU TAKE ME OUT OF LOW PRIORITY QUEUE?\nNo. We will not take your account out of low priority queue under any circumstances.\n\n\nIf you have any more questions, [check out the leaver buster FAQ](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752714-LeaverBuster-FAQ)","replies":[{"poster":"Sorrowind","date":"2017-05-21T14:13:55.761+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"CAN YOU TAKE ME OUT OF LOW PRIORITY QUEUE?\nNo. We will not take your account out of low priority queue under any circumstances.\n\nWhere did you get the idea that I would ask that?\n\nYour reasoning is fair to me, as I would reason it the same way as well.\n\nHowever your assumption of:\n CAN YOU TAKE ME OUT OF LOW PRIORITY QUEUE?\n\nMakes your judgement questionable.","replies":[]}]}]}
