I&#039;m looking for a team where we can all improve and develop our skill sets in a non-toxic environment. I believe in having a nice chill environment where by making a simple mistake you can reflect and improve as a team rather than receive the abundant flame of soloq. I know I&#039;m definitely capable of reaching a higher elo than the one I&#039;m currently at given the right dedication to learn as well as the time spent in ranked games. \r\n\r\nThe new direction Rito has taken with the &#039;ranked dynamic queue&#039; has been another big reason to invest some time into finding a team. I believe in Season 6 having a team in ranked solo q will probably be a vital tool for progression. \r\n\r\nMy current mains are adc/mid - Although I&#039;m always looking to expand on what positions I can effectively in the future given practice. \r\n\r\nWith that all said please feel free add  - Even if your not looking for a team and simply like what you see. ;) \r\n\r\nCheers all,\r\n\r\n:) \r\n\r\n{{champion:26}}","replies":[{"poster":"Tazo","date":"2015-12-20T10:36:09.564+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"If you get people add me bro, jungle/supp here, i'd be keen!","replies":[]}]}
