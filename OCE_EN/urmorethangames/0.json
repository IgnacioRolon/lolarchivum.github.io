And we were like OK we let the first game go, we can try catch up in next few games , because we made mistake. Now is how unsportsmanship comes in the organizer goes : no you are out of the tournament!!! Wow such a rude organizer.\nAlso we been told its going to be a NZ based tournament and only NZ teams will join, we found there are numbers of AUS teams in this tournament.\nWe are so disappointed because they are doing such thing to faithfull LOL player and their team. We were issued auto FF for not checking in, and we havent received any check in info. this is a joke. Please post comment if you suffered the same.","replies":[{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2019-11-21T11:50:16.114+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Given that the tourney is run by NZEsports and not Riot, I would recommend contacting them for more info: https://nzesports.com/contact-us/\n\nThere isn't really anything we can offer you here on boards.","replies":[]}]}
