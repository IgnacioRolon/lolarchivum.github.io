Since Flex is a new queue everyone's MMR will be set to a \"standard\" (generally around Silver 5 MMR) so you'll likely be matched with higher ranked players while everyone works their way back to where they should be. If I remember correctly, in the case of the recent changes to ranked queues Riot did adjust people's MMRs slightly based on their previous rankings. I honestly wouldn't be surprised if Riot decided to restrict Flex more heavily on OCE or even remove it altogether to \"combat\" queue health issues.","replies":[{"poster":"Roguestoney","date":"2016-12-24T11:39:27.801+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Lol sry too many wines with the wife.
