You aren't anywhere near good, you're barely average, don't get mad because your stats prove this, you have absolutely nothing to offer anyone if anything you would probably be telling people the wrong thing.\n\nPlat players are terrible, i would know i just got out of Plat on this account.","replies":[{"poster":"Deceiver","date":"2015-04-06T21:52:21.865+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"A High diamond person could be a teacher but not have the real life skills to actually teach someone.

And your last ranked game was 23 days ago, you barely play and you think you're gonna climb let alone teach people how to play? (which includes teaching them how to climb)\n\nBtw you'll decay in five days if you don't play.","replies":[{"poster":"Deceiver","date":"2015-04-09T22:31:04.221+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"hahaha more deaths than kills in my KDA, please stop lying.
