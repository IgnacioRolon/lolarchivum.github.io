I purchased $20 worth of rp (2250). When I went to buy a $10 rp an error appeared, which then I checked my cards balance to see I was charged $20.70.

It will usually say somewhere on the card if there is anything of the sort, though I don't know if the surcharge would be on Riot's end or the card company. \n\nIt's kinda like how some places will charge a 2% or something surcharge on purchases under $5 or $10 on a credit/debit card.","replies":[{"poster":"Darcy","date":"2016-02-07T02:38:07.840+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Those surcharges are done by the seller, it's actually illegal for them to do it and credit card companies never do it.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Reported4Verbal","date":"2016-02-08T09:48:32.736+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Scammers confirmed? haha.\n\nProbably a surcharge of some sort.

It's done differently depending on the provider. Some will have surcharge on purchase (which essentially results in a slightly smaller amount on the card), surcharge on charge (so you pay the charge when you put money on the card, and the money on the card is exact) and some will have a set amount that you pay for the card itself (but usually with other conditions, like it has to be used a certain amount or it will be invalidated).\n\nThe rules and charges vary drastically between company and type/use of prepaid card.\n\nYou're better off finding an EB Games or similar to buy the RP cards if say Woolies runs out because you are guaranteed the amount of RP you pay for. Some Dick Smiths/JB Hi Fi and the like will also sell them.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Ediwir","date":"2016-02-06T10:00:41.030+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"What Seras said.\nAny transaction that goes trough a middle man can incur in extra payments... It's up to you to check how those work, as different means use different systems. Most credit cards charge you a monthly fee, prepaid cards charge you in different ways (some ask for extra on charge, some on purchase), and phone charge is not something i'd want to use ever.\nBasically everyone wants your money, and finds different ways to get it.","replies":[]}]}
