If this doesn't happen i do not want anyone to rip off or take my own character because it is my original work. The champion is a tanned male still without a name. He wears a white mask with smoke coming out where his mouth is. He has orange hair and his right arm is made of complete fire, as is his legs. He uses fire to make legs that make him float/hover/fly and looks like spinning fire. He has a black cape that is red on the inside with a chain that attaches it together and a brown leather strap that goes around his chest. He uses a sword a fire on the battlefield. His sword has a unique shape and design. He is someone that is kind hearted even though he dose not look it. He will not anyone he cares about get hurt or die. He carries the burdens of all people and doesn't let anyone else now about his true inner suffering. He is someone who hides everything on the inside and does what he can for the people around him. When he was younger everyone he knew died. He will never let that happen to him or anyone ever again. Even though he is someone that doesn't want people to die if you are his enemy he will kill you when he has to without hesitation and show no mercy. He is fast and strong. No ordinary person or thing can ever hope to beat him and has not lost to anyone ever since the day the people he knew die. No one knows what happened and he will never tell anyone, ever. This is just something i had in my head. It can be changed but not completely. I hope you like it Riot an consider it. THANK YOU and please anyone from the community looking at this get noticed i would really love this to happen.\r\n\r\nI dont know if there good or not or if the passive is a bit too good. The idea is to have a mobile fighter that has a play style almost like riven. I also related the abilities to the story i made him.\r\n\r\nPassive: Will of Fire\r\nWhen under 25% health deal %% bonus damage to health. This stacks up to four times when allied champions near you are under 20% health.\r\n\r\nQ: Righteous Strike\r\nDashes forward with his sword dealing attack damage. Bonus damage is dealt if Righteous Strike goes through the enemy.\r\n\r\nw: Infernal Protector\r\nDashes to an area creating a crack much like a volcano and knocks up enemies. When allies walk through they gain a shield that does a damage over time when enemies are near them and giving a slight speed boost. The crack does damage to an enemy to the same amount the shield absorbs.\r\n\r\nE: Merciless Bash\r\nUses his mask to headbutt an enemy and roots them for 1.75 seconds and does attack damage.\r\n\r\nR: Savior's Might\r\nRighteous Strike has a longer range, Infernal Protector's crack is bigger, gives more of a shield which also gives it more damage, Merciless Bash roots for a longer duration and gain an attack damage bonus and movement speed bonus.\r\n\r\nAlso i made a quote but i feel it's quite cheesy \"I fight for the people i care for\"","replies":[]}
