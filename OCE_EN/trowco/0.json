I main ADC and SUPP, I can learn JG if needed, but ADC is my strongest. I get along with people very easily. I am senior in high school. I can play everyday, I can practice everyday, currently in Silver 5. I was in Bronze 5 and I was sick of being in it then I went on a carry/win spree and now trying to get out of silver but people feed and give up once they see a tilt (so personally i don&#039;t think I belong in silver). I try hard all the way throughout the games period and my CS is always higher than my opponent.\r\n\r\n\r\nContact me on NA Servers - Trowco is my summoner name. Thanks for reading and take it easy.","replies":[{"poster":"Izou","date":"2015-10-29T05:27:40.798+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"wrong board bruh this is OCE","replies":[]}]}
