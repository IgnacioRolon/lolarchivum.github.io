I can keep a relative track of camp clearing times, or from base to exact mid etc...\nBut what i wanna know (assuming the perfect scenario of having full vision (of your area, AND all 5 enemies)) is if its quicker to go around underneath this rock or that rock, etc... \nI know it chooses the best line for your ULTIMATE goal, but that line it chooses DOESN&#039;T take into account for vision or champ location/your map awareness.. you can reclick to re set the line, closer  to you to adjust for this of course, and avoid certain places, and i guess that&#039;s where this kinda comes in; if THAT bush is warded, is it gonna be quicker to go this way? Or that way? ESPECIALLY for something like going from river to toplane inner turret *area* THROUGH blue buff/gromp/down past wolves... Your ultimate location can change and i guess it&#039;d just be handy...\n\nThe only con is it may crowd the map :P :/...\n\nBut I digress that I opened with a question: Is this a thing of any sort?","replies":[{"poster":"FxH","date":"2016-06-06T10:31:37.914+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I don't think they should make the game that easy, they already added buff timers and such, meaning players no longer need to have things such as those on their head whilst playing. This takes away a lot of the thought needed to play to the best degree, and I personally do not like that.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Nijel","date":"2016-06-06T13:24:35.222+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Having access to the exact pathing times could be useful but I can't imagine a way it could represented on the minimap that wouldnâ€™t clutter it with a mass of lines and numbers. To be honest, it kind of seems like the kind of thing you might learn over time without really thinking about it. Knowing which way to go and when to avoid wards are a central part of the learning experience, like csing or teamfighting, so I don't really see any reason to add such a feature in Ranked, but I do see a spot for it in a sandbox mode if one were to be implemented.","replies":[]},{"poster":"BurningAvalanche","date":"2016-06-06T10:08:48.350+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"riiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiip, i accidently clicked no.
