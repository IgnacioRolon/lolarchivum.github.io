But around a month later i was in a pretty intense game with friends and i was top lane singed, was being camped and things led to another, and i winded up saying \"kys\" and \"you boys gay\" in a humorous manner, no ill intentions, of course other things were pulled up like me saying that \"you can't kill me im 4/2/0\" its been around 2 months since my main was banned and getting pretty sad that i lost around 7 years of games, I wrote to riot but only got bots answering questions i didn't ask and telling me information i already knew.\r\n________________________________\r\nGame 1\r\nIn-Game\r\nMilkboy: kys\r\nMilkboy: no one can touch this 4/2/0\r\nMilkboy: hopefully\r\nMilkboy: i would deck u\r\nMilkboy: dab\r\nMilkboy: dab\r\nMilkboy: kys\r\nMilkboy: u boys gay\r\n________________________________\r\n\r\n-Milkboy","replies":[{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2019-08-07T13:52:27.467+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"If you want the short answer, I'd lean towards yes, but we don't really have enough info to give a definitive answer. For the longer answer, read on and I'll try to give as much context as possible.\n\nFirst up, this wouldn't have been a perma if you didn't have a recent 14-day ban. Typically, punishments will follow a 4 tier escalation: 2 chat restrictions, then 14-day, then perma. There are some behaviours (which I'll get to in a bit) that can escalate you past chat restrictions, but you will always receive at least a 14-day ban as a warning of your behaviour (there are exceptions but not relevant here and all for obvious reasons).\n\nYou mention that the 14-day was the result of a friend's behaviour. Ultimately, this is still your responsibility. Account sharing, while explicitly against the ToS, isn't typically punished, however, if you willingly share your account you lose a lot of the protections a fully secure account has. The \"it was someone else playing on my account\" excuse being one of them. If your account had been compromised, it would be a different matter, but since you chose to share your account you are fully responsible for the actions taken on it.\n\nSo if the 14-day stands, then that means the next tier is a permanent suspension. I mentioned behaviours that escalate straight to 14-day, and use of no-tolerance language is one of them. Specifically, this refers to things like suicide encouragement (kys), hate speech (racism, homophobia), threats, etc. To one degree or another, you demonstrated all three.\n\nThe \"kys\" is obviously the most problematic. You say you were joking and there was no ill intent but you also say that you said such things as a result of frustration, which doesn't exactly support such language being taken that way. If the context of the rest of the log (i.e your team/enemy team chat) shows that it was said in a purely joking matter then you *might* have a case for a *reduction* in punishment.\n\nTelling someone to kill themselves is certainly no joke, and even if you were saying it to a friend and not a stranger, you are in a public setting.\n\nIf you want to appeal, then following through with support is the way to go. You mention bot responses, but unless you specifically get a response from BlitzBot it's not a bot. Often they will be macro (pre-written) responses for your initial ticket, as first-tier support is designed to answer as many questions as quickly as possible. With more nuanced cases those pre-writes can miss the mark, in which case simply reply. Second contact support will always be a custom response.","replies":[{"poster":"Milkboy","date":"2019-08-08T04:49:21.925+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I would like to ask about how i can get into contact with the staff at riot because as i said before i tried contacting them, but only got the automated blitzbot response. also thanks for that response clears a lot up.","replies":[{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2019-08-08T05:04:06.904+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Support is the way to do so.
