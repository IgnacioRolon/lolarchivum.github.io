So the game loaded and I'm in teambuilder where we all waited for more than five minutes for a game to start.  Once it started loading to the battlefield the slowness got worse.  My champion was moving in slow motion!  How is it possible for me to game at all?  So I told the team I have to restart.  After I returned, of course they are losing (particularly playing with lower tiers) and we have no team work either.  All in all, after we lost the game and went back to the score board I had a message popped up.\r\nIt is stating that by AFK and leaving the game I have jeopardized the game and telling me not to do it again by typing in \"I agree\".\r\n\r\nWell, if I didn't have the issue I wouldn't have left the game to restart my PC would I??\r\n\r\nThe point is, there were no other options besides forcing an agreement where you don't have a choice to explain what really happened.\r\n\r\nThat is not entirely fair is it?  Why isn't there a choice or a comment box besides \"I agree\"?","replies":[{"poster":"HORSE OF FORCE","date":"2015-02-28T10:32:04.689+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"That is designed to make people aware of the decision they're making when they intentionally leave a game.
