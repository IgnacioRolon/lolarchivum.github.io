Not at all sure what would cause this though, very strange. Normally with something like this I'd assume the game you got kicked from wasn't actually still active but if someone was spectating it that's very weird.\n\nHiccups of this nature do pop up from time to time though and are usually very isolated. Unless it happens to you again or more people start reporting it I wouldn't worry about it :)","replies":[]},{"poster":"QAPLA","date":"2018-02-26T07:17:44.094+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I think I experienced this _'once'_ a few years ago, never happened to me again since.\n\nIt's just a random glitch, and quite rare.","replies":[]}]}
