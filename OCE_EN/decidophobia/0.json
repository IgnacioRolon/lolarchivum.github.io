Make sure that your Internet Explorer is working fine. If that's no dice and you can't figure out why the store is messed up, reset your Internet Options (accessible from Internet Explorer itself) to defaults and you should be fine.\n\nIf that doesn't fix it, send in a support ticket. You said it's working fine for NA so your Internet settings may have nothing to do with the issue. Best of luck with it.","replies":[]}]}
