The only way you can have an elo and not be ranked is if you didn't complete your placements and soft resets happen for the next season.\n\nYou can be considered average if unranked, as norms arn't ranked, they are just norms and alot of players muck around etc.","replies":[{"poster":"TeCoolMage","date":"2015-10-13T09:49:29.143+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Wait, I'm confused now.

Not their ranked elo.\nBelieve it or not, there is a normal game elo separate to a ranked elo.\nThats why you can see a plat or gold player playing against lower ranked players on there own. They have a crap normal game elo compared to their ranked game elo.","replies":[{"poster":"TeCoolMage","date":"2015-10-17T01:17:31.196+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"So placement matches, start with normal elo, to establish division and ranked elo, then everything else goes as expected?\n\nThat's confusing but it makes sense :P","replies":[]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Zorphiax","date":"2015-10-11T01:26:56.800+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Unranked is Bronze - World Class.
