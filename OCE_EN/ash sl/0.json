The only constraint we face is the ping, unfortunately for Ocenia we get around 300-400 ping which is not possible to play with.A friend introduced garena and in garena servers we get around 60 ping which is more than perfect for us and all of us here know that if we want to improve as a county and go to the next level we need to move to garena servers and participate in south east asain tournaments.But then again most of hesitate to do because they dont want to loose their accounts which they have made putting lot of money and hard work.To get to level 30 and have at least some rune pages and runes, own the favorite champs and not to forget to buy the skins they want it will take more than one year and a lot of money.If it is made possible that there is a transfer option from Oceania to Garena all of us with our hard felt gratitude will move with the blink of an eye even though it cost 2600 rp. Since this is not available we see a trend i.e most of us here are frustrated and quitting league joining dota 2 and i personally dont want to leave league because i love the game too much and also hate to see this happening.So i want to know can Riot arrange something like transfer option to garena?","replies":[{"poster":"ASH SL","date":"2015-01-27T10:35:37.837+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"k...wil do :D","replies":[]},{"poster":"HORSE OF FORCE","date":"2015-01-23T05:58:46.794+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"That sucks how it's not available.
