Also wouldn't it be better if you actually got matched with and against people who are also in their promos so everyone will play their best?? Why is there no in-game voice chat available as-well, this game has been out for how long? How come there is no pre-requisite to play a ranked match as-well for newcomers?","replies":[{"poster":"Saldean","date":"2015-03-07T14:44:44.966+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I have seen sometimes that players are matched against others that are in their promos, overall its the match making system and I don't know much about it. To expand on your in-game voice chat, I myself would not want that to be implemented in league due to the problems and issues like you are in for example, players would argue with other players. However I know that curse voice i still used in the american servers and it is also promoted here as well, so if you have the chance look it up and see if you like it or not. For new-comers to league, at level 30 is required to rank but it comes from  your decision to rank or not hence some players get ranked anxiety and fear of playing a ranked game. I was like that too, so shaky about ranked for the first time during season 2 and man I couldn't get over it. :^","replies":[]}]}
