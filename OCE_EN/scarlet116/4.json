During Lanning try to stack your blubs on the bushes so when the enemy goes to ward there you can use your root skill to turn them to monsters, since your building AP or 1/2 AP they do lots of damage. Your Q has a delay so E is always better imo.\n\n2. When playing against a hook champ try to move around your bulbs and try to spawn some near the adc. So when the hook comes and if you can't dodge or your adc can't you can run your roots on them so the hook gets the plant and not you.\n\n3.  Zoning as zyra is good to put your bulbs behind the enemy minions when they walk up root it so plan monters attack them. The bulbs can't be removed unless someone walks over it so yeah fun times for you stacking {{item:3311}}  :)\n\nGood items to have:\n{{item:3151}}  {{item:3116}}  \nI would even say {{item:3116}} is a must have the slow is very nice gives you chance to ult they can't get out or land your other skills.\n\nYou can also intitate quite well if you don't get poped first. Example flash, root, ult, Zhonya. Then let your team clean up. if they have trouble drop redemption / locket but you get the idea.\n{{item:3157}}  \n\nHope that helps!","replies":[]}]}
