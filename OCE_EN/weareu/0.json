So recently i thought \"well if i know i&#039;m going to have chance of afking, why don&#039;t i just play co-op that way i can still play lol and not ruin other peoples games hence i wont get punished\" but i was wrong turns out lever buster works on co-op games!!!!\n\nRiot can you please abolish the lever buster for co-op games. Remember co-op is a game against bots not humans so by me afking my team wont lose or suffer cause they are one player short.....","replies":[{"poster":"HORSE OF FORCE","date":"2015-04-24T12:10:03.175+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":">and not ruin other peoples games\n\nBut you're still leaving games, making teams have one less person to assist them in winning, *even though it's a bot game*.\n\nThough the fact that if you do afk, then a bot will also afk. It kind of balances.\n\nBut if Riot go up and say, \"Yeah, it's ok to afk in bot games I guess,\" then literally every game will have five afk players in it, because they'll be farming the IP/XP to make new level 30 accounts.\n\nIt's a trade off.\n\nAlso, as for your personal penalty, Riot's policy is to \"not remove any low priority queues under any circumstances.\"","replies":[]},{"poster":"weareu","date":"2015-04-24T04:15:23.076+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Riot cancel the current lever-buster thing on my account","replies":[]}]}
