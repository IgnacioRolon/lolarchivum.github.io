One extra second is added to the stun if it reflects off at least two pieces of terrain.

Allied champions can move through the Circle of the Lost granting a small movement speed bonus and a smaller heal (these immediately cease when they exit the circle) While Spire is in the Circle of the Lost, he gains increased health and drains the health from his enemies. \r\nAllied Movement Speed Bonus: 5/10/15 move speed\r\nAllied healing: 5/10/15 health per second\r\nDamage: 100/200/300 +100% AD damage\r\nHealth increase:  100/200/300 +4% of his maximum health\r\nHealth drain: 5/7/9 health per second \r\n\r\n&ldquo;I am the Last of the Lost.&rdquo;\r\n--Spire, the Pretorian of the Lost\r\n\r\nLines:\r\nSelection: &ldquo;To serve and protect.&rdquo;\r\n\r\nMovement:  \r\n&ldquo;To the guard.&rdquo;\r\n&ldquo;Defensive positions.&rdquo;\r\n&ldquo;Go forth.&rdquo;\r\n&ldquo;The Lost shall be found.&rdquo;\r\n\r\nAttacking:\r\n&ldquo;Offensive positions!&rdquo;\r\n&ldquo;Shields up.&rdquo;\r\n&ldquo;Stand your ground.&rdquo;\r\n&ldquo;Hold your own.&rdquo;\r\n&ldquo;Face me!&rdquo;\r\n&ldquo;Feel the power of my kin!&rdquo; (Only for Power of the Lost)\r\n\r\nTaunt:\r\n&ldquo;I stand for the Lost, what do you stand for?&rdquo;\r\n&ldquo;My shield is unbreakable, try it yourself.&rdquo;\r\n\r\nJoke:\r\n&ldquo;Feeling lost Summoner?&rdquo;\r\n&ldquo;Such crude weapons swords are.&rdquo; (Taunt against any champion wielding a sword)\r\n&ldquo;Bows and arrows will not break my bones.&rdquo; (Taunt against any champion using a ranged weapon.)\r\n\r\nLore:\r\nSpire was the defender of a once great village known for its great protectors and warriors who defended many in the past and were known for their heroic great stands. Spire himself was training to become another legend, worthy of the history books. Starting from a young age, he took up the art of fighting and unlike his many peers who went for the sword; he chose the shield, a rare pick since many legends of the village were sword masters. Even the legendary Master Yi and Fiora had visited the small village and Demacia and Noxus were known to respect the village with great pride and power. However, upon the Noxian invasion, although many lower Noxian officials argued against the invasion of the village, it was deemed necessary to advance towards greater targets. Upon hearing the news of the imminent attack, Demacia and Ionia both sent forces to assist in the village&rsquo;s defence however they were sent back. The village elder said that the village and they alone would handle the matter. For three constant days the village held their own against the savage Noxian forces even when Darius and Katarina were deployed to kill them, the current legends stood up and fought and won. After the constant siege, Noxus deployed chemical weapons made by Singed and wiped out many of the defenceless warriors, never trained against such a weapon. To preserve their legacy, the village elder, father of Spire begged his son to hide and let him face the weapons. Not backing down from a fight Spire charged into the fray amid the chemical bombardment and fought until he passed out. Recovering he found his entire village dead and his father personally poisoned by Singed, weakened by using his magic to protect his son. The village now was known as the Land of the Lost Legends. Spire then vowed to protect all and never to act upon his impulses. Picking up his magically imbued shield by his father, he held the souls of the Lost and he swore that he would protect all the others who fought against the evils. \r\n\r\nPlay-Style:\r\nSpire requires quite a lot of skill as a bruiser to play since he mostly benefits in teamfights or skirmishes of 2v1s or 2v2s. Reflection of the Lost provides a lot of utility being a first stun at level one and is a useful farming tool especially when angled to reflect off the line between melee and caster minions. In addition, Reflection of the Lost, as a linear skill shot provides equal chasing and gap closer combos when paired with Unison of the Lost. Spirit of the Lost provides what constitutes his main tankiness and bruiser side to him giving him sustain in lane. This also provides him a quick escape if ganked and the armour and magic resist bonus provides a bit more resistance to any long pokes from junglers like Nidalee if they try to finish him off. However he truly shines when he is in solo lane combat or teamfights. In solo lane combat in order to secure a kill this is his normal combo, fire and angle Reflection of the Lost to stun the enemy champion, then he does Unison of the Lost to immediately teleport to his shield and damaging the champion in the process while slowing him to limit movement speed increase buffs or jumps. If the champion however flashes away, he can then use Reflection of the Lost and Unison of the Lost combo again to jump to them due to the cooldown reduction. With this constant combo in top lane and presumably, proper map awareness, Spire can easily lane and push once he executes this combo. If he doesn&rsquo;t get the kill however, it would severely damage his lane opponent to either recall or get a gank. Teamfights however Spire is one of the best initiators. A typical teamfight in mid lane would go something like this (Given this is late game). Spire leads in front and draws the enemy team in with Power of the Lost. Using his Reflection and Unison combo to jump into the fray he then uses Spirit of the Lost to gain himself even more sustain given that he can occupy the entire team while the rest of his teammates catch up. Given this, other champions would then execute their combos such as Braum using his ultimate damaging everyone and given there is also a Yasuo on the team, he also ults granting an extremely rare five man ult.\r\n\r\nComments please and thanks everyone :)","replies":[{"poster":"Talon12","date":"2015-08-30T07:07:24.621+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"**Name: Spire, Pretorian of the Lost**\nType: Bruiser\nHealth: 597 (+81.7 per level)\nHealth Regen: 4.73 (+0.7 per level)\nRange: 150 (Melee)\nMana: 297 (+43 per level)\nMana Regen: 3 (+0.2 per level)\nAttack Damage: 57 (+3.7 per level)\nAttack Speed: 0.72 (+0.04)\nArmor: 24(+1.45 per level)\nMagic Resist: 32(+1.1 per level)\nMovement Speed: 340\n\n\nPassive\n Last of the Lost:\nEvery minute Spire gains 1.5 armor and 1 magic resist.
