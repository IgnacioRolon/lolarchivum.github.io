He lived an ordinary life, having a caring family and being the resident fighter whenever bandits came to try pillage. One fateful day, when Xerath ascended, Saber’s little town was caught in a gigantic sandstorm, caused by the massive surge of power from the Magus Ascendant. Weathering the sandstorm for countless days, people began to die in the little town with Saber’s family the only ones left. Once the sandstorm had cleared, Saber was stunned to find only his family left in the entire town with his wife and children still dying from starvation. In their brawl, Nasus and Renekton stumbled upon the town. Taking no care of it, they continued to fight not realising Saber’s family was still there. The fight then got out of hand as Renekton, out of madness and rage crushed Saber’s house with his wife and children. Raging, Saber, to his surprise unleashed an energy burst knocking Renekton back. The spellbound Nasus then realised that this was the very village that a knight had been born from, back in the times of the Shuriman Empire, a knight called Steelheart that defied the Shuriman Empire in defence of his village. He sought to stop the reign of Xerath as he ascended many years ago but was killed on the doorstep of the palace, being obliterated by the sheer power. Upon the call, the spirit materialised before Saber and bestowed him with being his descendant. Crafting the very armour Steelheart wore himself; Saber donned the mantle of Steelheart’s Descendant and vowed to finish what his ancestor sought to do. End the madness and reign of Xerath and what he did to his family and Steelheart.\n“I will not fall, this is the will of Steelheart.”\n--Saber, Steelheart’s Descendant\n\nAllies: Azir, Sivir and Nasus\nAzir: Steelheart wishes the rightful owner of the throne of Shurima to return so his village may be left in peace and laid to rest. Saber entrusts Azir to do that.\nSivir: Saber travels with Sivir as one of her mercenaries however only joins if there are people to defend as he fights for honour as he once did for his people. \nNasus: Saber feels that in order to keep his village safe and in peace, he must help Nasus with his quest in saving his brother Renekton. \n\nEnemies: Renekton and Xerath\nRenekton: Renekton destroyed his house along with his family. (Pretty easy why Saber doesn’t like Renekton)\nXerath: When Xerath ascended, the surge of his energy caused a sandstorm to kill the rest of the villagers in his mad rush to power.\n\nLines:\nSelection: “Steelheart shall live”\n\nMovement:\n“Spirit of Steelheart.”\n“We shall endure.”\n“Bring forth those who threaten my name.” \n\nAttacking:\n“Feel my blade!”\n“Taste my fury!”\n“Strike with steel!”\n“I will not be crushed!” (Only for Steelheart’s Defender)\n“Steelheart Ascend!” (Only for Steelheart Ascended)\n\nTaunt:\n“Magus Ascendant, meet Steelheart” (Only if there is an enemy Xerath)\n“Stand aside, let me ascend.” (Only if there is an allied Xerath)\n“You shall pay for my family!” (Only if there is an enemy Renekton)\n“Nasus, help me avenge my people.” (Only if there is an allied Nasus)\n“Steel sharpens steel. Let’s see if my steel will break against your’s.”\n“Let’s see if the Grandmaster can learn a trick or two.” (Only if there is an enemy Jax)\n\nJoke:\n“I am the Steel Summoner, you are bronze.”\n “Man of Steel eh?”\n\nThanks guys for commenting and at least taking a look  \nI will be posting up a playstyle soon for Saber. To be honest, I really think he should be a champion in League. If you are interested, look for my other champion concept, Spire, the Pretorian of the Lost.\nThanks!\n\n\n\n \n\n\n","replies":[{"poster":"Torea2","date":"2015-09-05T06:38:32.619+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"wow dude this i awesome\n\nlegit i love it and anything that adds into the shurima story","replies":[]},{"poster":"Tonight Forever","date":"2015-09-03T02:20:29.078+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"pics?","replies":[{"poster":"Savarin","date":"2015-09-03T06:05:14.536+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Unfortunately I am not an artist really, just a champion designer.
