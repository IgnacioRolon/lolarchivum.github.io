The Light existed as an order that used the power of runes and magical weapons such as a staff to further the world&rsquo;s existence, sometimes saving the ancient world from epic beasts or even causing catastrophic events in order to preserve some. Locke, out of the entire order, was born with rich dark ebony hair. With her birth many elders questioned the appearance of such a peculiarity within the Light. However her mother, one of the high ranking elders, sought to solve that, by training her daughter in some of the most potent staff arts. Upon majoring in the art of healing, Locke&rsquo;s mother saw her daughter as a dark horse of the Light and changed her mind in trying to convert her. With the surge of the Darkin Blade Aatrox, the Light sought to intervene to stop the massacre of the Magelords, however in rage and bloodlust, the Darkins themselves fought with the Light over a series of years with both races almost being obliterated. With the Darkin victories and Light defeats, they retreated back to their capital, the Darkin held no bars against the Light. They viciously tore through the city of mages. Realising their inevitable defeat, Locke&rsquo;s mother sent her daughter down to the world they once protected to avoid a death by the Darkin. Sacrificing herself, Locke&rsquo;s mother doomed the Darkin forces in the capital city, destroying it completely. Landing in a magical well of runes, Locke fell unconscious for centuries until she was awakened by the resurgence of the Darkin Blade Aatrox. Waking up, empowered by the runes that bathed her in their magic while she slept, she then sought out the Darkin Blade which eventually led her to the League.\r\n&ldquo;The Light will continue to shine.&rdquo;\r\n--Locke, the Rune of the Light \r\n\r\nLines:\r\nSelection: &ldquo;Light shine bright.&rdquo;\r\nMovement:\r\n&ldquo;Towards the Light.&rdquo;\r\n&ldquo;Magic and runes, guide me.&rdquo;\r\n&ldquo;Staff, lead the way.&rdquo;\r\n\r\nAttacking:\r\n&ldquo;Blind them!&rdquo;\r\n&ldquo;Light shine forth!&rdquo;\r\n&ldquo;Runes empower me.&rdquo;\r\n&ldquo;Burn away Darkin!&rdquo; (Only if there is an enemy Aatrox)\r\n&ldquo;Let the Light reign!&rdquo; (Only for Power of the Light)\r\n\r\nTaunt:\r\n&ldquo;Let me enlighten you about where I came from.&rdquo;\r\n&ldquo;I am delighted to show you my&hellip;&hellip;&rdquo;\r\n\r\nJoke:\r\n(Tries to conjure an orb of light) &ldquo;Mother, why keep me in the dark?&rdquo;\r\n&ldquo;It&rsquo;s funny how you will go to the Light when you die.&rdquo;","replies":[]}
