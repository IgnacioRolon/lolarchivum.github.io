He can be played as an AP or an AD Champion but benefits most from hybrid with AD and AP. He has two ultimates but can only activate them once each of the three abilities has successfully hit the same enemy champion. He requires precise timing and extreme precision. His ultimate moves work in the process of applying three seven second de-buffs by using his Q, W and E to hit the enemy champion and once all three de-buffs are applied, he can use his ultimate on that enemy target champion. However to change modes, he must either use at least one ability in either mode or successfully pull off an ultimate in either mode. In this case, both ultimates have the same cooldown counter.\nName: Breaker, the Elemental Warrior\nHealth: 545 (+ 60 per level)\nHealth Regen: 3\t\nRange: 150 (Melee)\nMana: 325 (+35 per level)\nMana Regen: 1.5\nAttack Damage: 64 (+2 per level)\nAttack Speed: 0.82 (+5%)\nArmour: 30\nMagic Resist: 27\nMovement Speed: 355\n\nPassive\nElemental Resistance: Breaker has increased armour when he is in Sword mode and increased magic resist while in Elemental Mode. \nArmour increase: 6/8/10/12/14/16/18/20/22\nMagic Resist increase: 6/8/10/12/14/16/18/20/22\n\nSword Mode\n[Q] Fiery Strike\nPassive: Breaker&#039;s hones his sword to possess the power of fire increasing his damage on every auto attack.

He is a combination of Yasuo, Jayce and Lee Sin. His Sword Mode heavily relies on quick engaging and precise timing in lane in order to successfully pull off his ultimate while his Elemental Mode contributes more to team fights. \n\nHow Breaker&rsquo;s ultimates work:\nBreaker, similar to Lee Sin and Jayce, has two sets of abilities and like Jayce can change modes once he has either used at least one ability in either mode or used either ultimate. How his ultimate is even activated is another matter. Breaker relies on all three of his abilities to hit one (precisely one) enemy champion within a seven second period as they all apply seven second de-buff allowing Breaker to use his ultimate on them. If there are multiple champions with all three de-buffs he will prioritize the champion with the lowest health. \n\nFirstly, his Sword Mode. Breaker is designed to easily trade against both melee reliant and ranged champions in his sword mode having a gap closer and knock up.  Fiery Strike (Q) provides the ease of farming and occasional trades with the passive and the active. Shield Stride allows the opportunity for plenty of applications with his Fiery Strike or his Thunder Blow. A typical combo would be to gap close with Shield Stride, Thunder Blow, knocking the enemy champion up into the sky and land an easy Fiery Strike on them. Provided the level and items, this typical combo would be able to deter any champion from lane or secure a kill. Another alternative would be to knock up the champion with Thunder Blow, gap close with Shield Stride if they had an escape and land an easy Q. This combo is more suited to champions with more escapes such as Zed or Fizz. If all three de-buffs are applied, Breaker can then finish them off with his ultimate, however be extremely cautious when finishing his ultimate as he flashes back to his last location when he started his ult. With his overall passive granting extra armour, Breaker proves effective against close quarter champions such as Udyr, Fiora, Jax or Irelia who rely on sustained trades. \n\nSecondly, his Elemental Mode. Reliant on attack damage and ability power, his Elemental mode opens up a new perspective to him as if he is a fighter and mage. Although having a basic skill set for his Elemental Mode, what changes is his Water&rsquo;s Wave which literally allows Breaker to execute a combo and ultimate. Fire&rsquo;s Bite allows Breaker to counter a variety of mobile champions or champions who can stealth such as Teemo or Evelyn. His Q can also be used as poke against high harass champions in top or mid lane. Finally, Lightning&rsquo;s Strike is used as a primary stun as pure damage and crowd control. A typical combo in his Elemental mode would be to initiate with his Q, revealing the champion, laying down his W to slow the champion, allowing Breaker to catch up and in the process heal himself. Once the champion has been slowed he can land his E to immediately stun them. Once applied all three de-buffs he can \nsuccessfully use his ultimate with no worry since the target champion is stunned.\n\nPlease, if you view, please vote!\n","replies":[{"poster":"Sinceden","date":"2015-06-13T12:52:51.792+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"do u have the same brain as me??
