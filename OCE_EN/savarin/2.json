There&#039;s also a short story attached if you&#039;re into the lore part. \n\nName: Atlas, Heart&rsquo;s Defender\nHealth: 595 (+84 per level)\nSecondary Bar: None\nRange:150 (Melee)\nAttack Damage: 65 (+3 per level)\nArmour: 34 (+3 per level) \nMagic Resist: 30 (+1.5 per level) \nMovement Speed: 340\n\nPassive: Defender&rsquo;s Conviction\nEach time Atlas casts an ability, it grants him a boost of tenacity for the next three seconds. This can only occur once every few seconds and cannot stack (only refreshes). \nTenacity Boost: 5/10/15/20 (Lv1/6/11/16) \nPassive Cooldown: 20/15/10/5 seconds (Lv1/6/11/16) \n\nQ: Half-Hearted Strikes/Steel&rsquo;s Blow\nHalf-Hearted Strikes: Atlas&rsquo; next two basic attacks within the next five seconds deal extra damage and apply special effects in addition to increased attack range. (Ability goes on cooldown after the five seconds) \nIncreased Damage: 20/35/50/65/80 +50% AD\nIncreased Range: 50 (Total 200 Attack Range)\n\nFirst Basic Attack: Gains extra AD for the next five seconds\nAD Gain: 10/20/30/40/50 +5 Bonus Armour\n\nSecond Basic Attack: Gains extra armour for the next five seconds\nArmour Gain: 10/15/20/25/30 +5% Bonus AD\nCooldown: 9/8/7/6/5 seconds\n\nSteel&rsquo;s Blow: Gathering his strength into one swing, Atlas enhances the next basic attack to majorly slow the target for two seconds gaining the AD and Armour bonus from Half-Hearted Strikes as well as inflicting double Half-Hearted Strikes&rsquo; damage.\nIncreased Damage: 40/70/100/130/160 +80% AD\nSlow: 40% \nCooldown: 9/8/7/6/5 seconds\n\n\nW: Twin Shield Defender/Steelheart&rsquo;s Defender\nTwin Shield Defender: Atlas raises the two halves of his shields blocking all skill-shots from the left and right side of him for the next three seconds. In addition, he also gains damage reduction from all sources for the next three seconds as well. (Ability goes on cooldown after the three seconds)\nClarification: Imagine Twin Shield Defender being a smaller Braum E except two of them being on the left and right side of Atlas. \nCooldown: 11/10/9/8/7 seconds\n\nSteelheart&rsquo;s Defender: Having reforged the full shield, Atlas blocks all incoming skill-shots and gains damage reduction for the next three seconds before dashing (dash has a two second window), stopping at the first enemy champion hit stunning them and damaging them. (Units hit by the dash are dealt with half damage)\nDamage Reduction: 25/30/35/40/45% \nDamage: 50/90/130/170/200 +50% AD\nStun: 1.25/1.5/1.75/2/2.25 seconds\nCooldown: 10/9/8/7/6 seconds\n\nE: Defender&rsquo;s Rights/Defender&rsquo;s Honour\nDefender&rsquo;s Rights: Atlas dashes to a targeted area pushing aside any enemy units caught in the dash range while giving him a small movement speed buff for the next two seconds. \nCooldown: 8/7/6/5/4 seconds\n\nDefender&rsquo;s Honour: Atlas dashes to a targeted area or ally pushing aside any enemy units caught in the dash while also restoring a tiny bit of health to both Atlas and his ally along with the small movement speed buff. \nDash Range: 575\nMovement Speed Buff: 10/20/30/40/50% \nHeal: 10/20/30/40/50 +4% of Shield&rsquo;s Max HP\nCooldown: 8/7/6/5/4 seconds\n\nUltimate: Reforged\nReforges the two broken halves into the original Steelheart shield, Atlas gains extra resistances and abilities for the next 12 seconds. \nResistances Increase: 15/30/45\n\nShort Bio:\nA man riddled with conviction, Atlas, a lowly Demacian blacksmith came upon the power of Steelheart&rsquo;s shield, a weapon belonging to an ancient Demacian war hero. Worn for wear and broken in half, Atlas repaired both halves of the shield but despite his efforts, could not reforge the two halves of the legendary weapon back together. Sensing the great grip of principle Atlas had towards others, the shield bestowed its power upon him in his greatest time of need and now Atlas wields the ancient weapon as a symbol of the great Defender, Steelheart himself, to defend those who are without honour and love.  \n\nAppearance: Atlas dons a light leather armour with a solid silver armour on top of it, much sleeker than a medieval knight&rsquo;s. (Think of it like a scale armour except medieval styled). Atlas wears no helmet and wields each half of the Steelheart shield. The Steelheart shield is like a giant heart-shaped stainless steel shield, to put it easily. When he reforges the shield, he wields the full shield on his left arm. \n\nShort Story: \n&ldquo;Tell me, who do you fight for?&rdquo;\nA staggered breath escaped his lips as air struggled to flee from his lungs. The musk of blood clouded his senses, the precious liquid splattered around his body. Leather kicked at him again, jolting his body to spray another splatter of blood from his mouth. Vision blurry, red and brown flooded his eyes, knowing he was surrounded by both blood and enemies. \n&ldquo;I fight,&rdquo; he sputtered out, chest heaving with each breath he took. &ldquo;for those whom I love.&rdquo;\n&ldquo;Pathetic,&rdquo; the rogue spat out, saliva making its mark into the ground before him. &ldquo;For a Demacian citizen, you would expect to be more patriotic.&rdquo;\n&ldquo;My country is not all strength and justice as it makes it out to be.&rdquo;\n&ldquo;Demacia, the land of the strong and lawful, ain&rsquo;t about strength and justice?&rdquo; The rogue laughed, his mood changing from despicable to humorous, carelessly trampling about in the ruined field of death. Signalling some of his comrades to rightfully commandeer the resources of the nearby warehouse, he turned his attention back to the fallen figure. Shadow, dark as his soul, blocked the warmth of the sun from the injured man. \n&ldquo;So what&rsquo;s ya story then? A man who&rsquo;s got a broken back like you ain&rsquo;t gonna live long anyway so tell away.&rdquo;\n&ldquo;You wouldn&rsquo;t understand,&rdquo; the man said, regaining enough strength so his face wouldn&rsquo;t be drowned in his own blood. &ldquo;Someone like you has never had something to defend.&rdquo;\n&ldquo;I defend my stash. My gold. Riches. Which will be a lot more after we leave this village and take all of it.&rdquo;\nRaising his head, millimetre by millimetre, he barely met the rogue&rsquo;s eyes as the man spoke again. &ldquo;I assure you, I won&rsquo;t let that happen.&rdquo; \nThe band of scoundrels laughed, cackling like the crackle of fire resonating from the houses that surrounded them. Blood swished beneath their feet as one even fell over. \n&ldquo;Listen &lsquo;ere,&rdquo; the leader spoke once again, crouching down to see the man&rsquo;s hazy eyes. &ldquo;Ya whole village is dead. Me and my men slaughtered each and everyone of them. Soon we&rsquo;ll be off, celebrating our latest lootin&rsquo; and you&rsquo;ll be left here for dead.&rdquo;\nAtlas drew another breath, savouring his words. &ldquo;You didn&rsquo;t save everyone. When two of your men came to the blacksmith I managed to take one of them out while the other fled. I was protecting a boy who had hid there and escaped on one of the horses in the back stables.&rdquo;\nScoffing at the claim, the leader retained his crouching, staring at the gradually dying man. &ldquo;Like hell you beat one of my guys. Look at ya now. Barely able to even hold yourself up and bleeding like a manic.&rdquo;\nAtlas only had few words to say next. &ldquo;Ask your man with the green bandana wrapped around his arm. He was the one who fled.&rdquo;\nHearing only departing footsteps, angry shouts and returning footsteps confirmed Atlas&rsquo; claim. Pulled into the sunlight, the rogue grabbed his collar, holding him up while the other hand held Atlas at dagger-point. Limbs limp, Atlas couldn&rsquo;t even struggle against the rogue&rsquo;s firm grip as bladed steel was menacingly placed before his eyes. \n&ldquo;Just who the hell are ya?! We&rsquo;re the damn Rogue&rsquo;s Gallery, most feared rogues throughout Valoran. Even all these years damn Demacia haven&rsquo; been able to catch us from each raid we do.&rdquo; \nReceiving no reply, a sharp pain shot through Atlas&rsquo; left cheek. The dagger had been sheathed for a more traditional use of force. Footsteps shuddered back as the men feared their leader, more so in respect for his rage. \n&ldquo;Tell me now!&rdquo;\n&ldquo;My name is Atlas, and I am the one who defends.&rdquo; \nA gleaming shine of steel met the rogue&rsquo;s face as he flew back, staggering into the arms of his men. Hunched, still grievously injured, Atlas clutched one half of a broken shield, it&rsquo;s metal still shining despite the amount of bloodshed. Nursing the battered jaw, the Rogue&rsquo;s Gallery drew their weapons threateningly. Swords, daggers and single metal mace lined Atlas&rsquo; now clear sight with the leader drawing his own twin daggers. \n&ldquo;You&rsquo;re getting a quick death after that. No one wins against the Rogue&rsquo;s Gallery.&rdquo;\n&ldquo;You asked me who I fight for,&rdquo; Atlas muttered, drawing the second half of the shield from his back, the metal echoing with a vibrant echo as it was unsheathed from its case. &ldquo;I say again: I defend those whom I love.&rdquo;\nLight exploded as the two broken halves met, rippling shockwave of light blinding the rogues as all shuddered back in instinct. Eyes still blurry, whiteness revealed a standing figure, no longer injured, adorned in gleaming armour as the formerly broken weapon was now reforged together, radiating as a golden heart-shaped shield. \n&ldquo;You have slain many of those whom I love today&hellip; and I&rsquo;ll defend their honour.&rdquo;\n\nHope you enjoyed it!

But it is way too similar to Braum. I especially liked the idea of getting entirely new abilities upon using ult, but as I said, it is too similar to Braum so it wouldn’t work too well in the lore and in game","replies":[]},{"poster":"TheDespoiler","date":"2018-01-22T02:12:42.264+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Is it idea to create a champ that scales infinitely as long as it keeps autoing? It also seems to have an identity issue, massive murder free stat bruiser/ braum hybrid. Cool idea but targeted dash/heal utility spells for allies as seen in Braum don't seem to fit with free stats for hitting things as in Darius. Choose one or the other, I'd say.","replies":[]},{"poster":"EzeBlood","date":"2018-01-16T11:12:37.212+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"This is actually a really cool concept, a real harkening back to the older days of league. I think it fits fairly well with Riot's current way of going about the lore and stuff, and I definitely think we need more than just Braum and Yasuo who can block skillshots. This kit looks like it would work well with the theme you're going for, which comes across as a slightly more aggressive Braum, who can disrupt the enemies and draw enough attention away from his allies to let them get the job done, without being too strong of a threat on his own (Cough Cough Juggernauts). My one gripe with Atlas, is that his passive is SERIOUSLY boring. One thing Riot has been seen to be doing lately is adding new mechanics into the game with every new champion they release. Perhaps a new mechanic, something to do with clattering the shields together to deafen your enemies, turning their sounds down for a short period of time, could really psyche some people out of the game, and allow some major abilities to be used without being readily detectable from offscreen. \n\nOverall, I like it a lot, and think Riot may consider it, if with a few tweaks.","replies":[]}]}
