Not this frozen, hell-hole!&rdquo; growled out a young woman with bright blue hair, her thin, pale arms wrapped around her torso.\r\nWhat do you mean? It is a beautiful day! Just look at that sky!&rdquo; A huge man with an even bigger mustache commented from behind his massive ram shield.\r\n&ldquo;Well, it would help if you wore appropriate clothing, Jinx.&rdquo; Remarked Caitlyn calmly in her Arctic Warfare outfit.\r\n&ldquo;Oh shut up, Hat Lady!&rdquo; Jinx snarled back.\r\n&ldquo;Focus, the match is about to start.&rdquo; Garen interrupted the women by stepping between them, his massive pauldrons forming a formidable barrier between the Sheriff and the Loose Cannon, while his eyes were locked towards the other side of the bridge clocked in the fog of war.\r\n&ldquo;As much as I hate to admit it, Crownguard has a point.&rdquo; murmured Katarina as she headed off towards the first tower, flicking her flame red hair out of her face, as the mysterious voice of the announcer called the beginning of the fight.\r\n{{item:3157}} \r\nOne good thing about using Fishbones, other than the awesome explosions and its long range was the fact that the exhaust was helping to keep her warm as the wind picked up along Murder Bridge as the fight dragged on. The first tower had fallen pretty easily after Katarina Ks&#039;ed the first blood from her on the enemy Lux, but the other team had a fairly tanky Cho&#039;Gath and Darius that was making it difficult to get close enough to the second tower to bring it down, even with Pow Pow and Hat Lady&#039;s range. It didn&#039;t help that most of the poke they dished out was being healed by their Sona. Jinx had to laugh at the look on Garen&#039;s face when he saw that he had to fight his sister, although Kat hadn&#039;t seemed to have the same qualms when she saw Cassiopeia. The snake lady had been missing for a while now though.\r\nAs another wave of the mindless minions approached, Jinx switched to Pow Pow, giving the gatling gun a happy pat as it begin firing. Jinx shrieked as a snowball hit her in the face, she turned to see who threw it and suddenly had a grinning Darius right in her face.\r\n&ldquo;Braum is here!&rdquo; came a cry and suddenly Darius&#039; face was replaced with Braum&#039;s wide, bare back.\r\nJinx ran back throwing her Flame Chompers behind to ensure Darius would not keep following before turning to unleash Pow Pow&#039;s full attack speed on the Noxian. A wild grin lit up her face and her pink eyes sparkled as the gun roared in her hands. She saw a flash of light and yelled a warning to Braum. The big man moved surprisingly quick to dodge the binding. Kat came whirling through doing a chunk of damage on Darius before leaping for Lux. The little blonde was cut down almost instantly. Garen let loose a groan as he watched his little sister fall but kept heading towards Darius.\r\nAnother snowball smacked Jinx right in the chest and she screeched almost dropping Pow Pow as the cold ran through her chest. She screamed as Cho&#039;Gath&#039;s huge more appeared in her vision. She Flashed out of the way and hid in the bush. &ldquo;For frigs sake.&rdquo; Jinx growled.\r\nA little purr sounded off to her left and Jinx saw a little ball of fluff shaking in terror, its eyes huge as it took in Cho&#039;Gath&#039;s monstrous form.\r\nAww, you and me both buddy.&rdquo; Jinx muttered as she patted the Poro on the head. As the little creature koohed at her another grin began on her face, &ldquo;You know... why don&#039;t we blow this joint?&rdquo;\r\n{{item:3157}} \r\n Jinx came bursting out of the brush, Fishbones in one hand braced on her shoulder and a Poro tucked under the other arm like an oversized, furry football.\r\nAs she headed towards the Sheriff, Caitlyn called out, &ldquo;Jinx! What are you doing?&rdquo;\r\n&ldquo;Getting out of here, Hat Lady! Catch me if you can!&rdquo; Jinx yelled back as she ran past, swiping Caitlyn&#039;s hat along the way.\r\nThe Sheriff looked livid as the desire to chase the thief and her job to stop the Void monstrosity tore at her. With a growl she turned her rifle at Cho&#039;Gath and continued fighting.\r\nJinx slammed Cait&#039;s hat on her head and grinned at the Poro in her arm as she went past the second tower, the glowing blue inhibitor and reached the fountain and the shop ran by the ghostly old geezer. She leveled Fishbones at one of the gates beside the shop and fired her Super Mega Death Rocket. The old iron, frozen for decades shattered in the explosion and Jinx laughed madly as she slipped though the opening, ignoring the confused look on Garen&#039;s face as he re-spawned. The mysterious announcer cried, &ldquo;A champion has... left the...game?&rdquo; as Jinx vanished around a corner and down an icy tunnel.\r\n{{item:3157}} \r\n&ldquo;And that is how I got this awesome hat!&rdquo; Jinx finished with a giggle as she twirled Caitlyn&#039;s Arctic hat on her finger as she scratched her Poro&#039;s belly looking at her audience.\r\n&ldquo;Not a bad trick, Missy.&rdquo; Twisted Fate admitted as he downed his glass. Graves snorted a plume of smoke out his nose before removing his cigar from his mouth for a proper laugh.\r\n&ldquo;Now that is a good story and unlike TF here you got proof to back it up,&rdquo; Fate glared at the speaker as she leaned forward her red eyes glowed in the darkness of the bar and her blue skin, &ldquo;But I think I have a better one, despite the fact it takes a lot of effort to move like this in heels.&rdquo;","replies":[]}
