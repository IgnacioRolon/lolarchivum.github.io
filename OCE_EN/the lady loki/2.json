For the first half of the match did activated like it should (charge and the fire for dash and damage) and then after dying attempting to steal the enemies red buff it failed to even start again for the rest of the match. I left mid game to restart League to see if that would fix it but when I rejoined the match my Q still failed to start. All my other abilities were fine it was just Vault Breaker that failed to work.\r\n\r\nI just want to know how to fix it.","replies":[{"poster":"HORSE OF FORCE","date":"2015-01-23T10:42:16.434+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"[WHY HELLO THERE](http://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/bug-report)","replies":[{"poster":"The Lady Loki","date":"2015-01-23T11:21:08.532+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Um... hi.","replies":[{"poster":"HORSE OF FORCE","date":"2015-01-24T09:54:26.024+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You should post this on the \"Report a Bug\" board.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"SumCoolAid","date":"2015-01-23T01:49:38.434+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"This sounds like a genuine bug with League of Legends. +1 Voted so Riot sees this.","replies":[]}]}
