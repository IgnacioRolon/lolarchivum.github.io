This is happening for all my friends too. I know this is the issue because we can still play together, I just can&#039;t be the one sending the invites, I need a friend who is lower ranked in solo queue to create the game.\r\n\r\nAnyway I can work around this issue but it is quite inconvenient.\r\n\r\nOCE server.
