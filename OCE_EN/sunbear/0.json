It&#039;s getting pretty annoying to fluff around for 30 mins loggin in and out every time we wanna ranked 5s.\r\n\r\nAnyone else experienced similar issues?","replies":[{"poster":"HORSE OF FORCE","date":"2015-04-15T12:23:37.388+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I don't play teams, like ever, so I can't really say.\n\nTry posting this on the Misc. boards.
