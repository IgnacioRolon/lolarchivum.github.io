Just revert it please. Those who want to know why, comment below. Get riot to notice because this is f*****g dumb and I believe it is so stupid because they mention that laners help their jungle secure the crab. How is this a problem?? You cant just answer a call like this and slap on a nerf because players are being outsmarted? This is a strategy made by the players and rarely anyone does it. You also realise this is bad for early game junglers, xin zhao jarvan iv etc. You are completely negating early game junglers so they become useless. Then the change makes league very meta specific game because you are trying to bring tanks back in power by pulling the plug on other junglers and is unwelcoming. Despite this if enemies manage to get a big lead, they will definitely prioritise scuttle a lot more and makes it even harder to find turning points in games. So much for the new bounty system. You already ruin players jungle pathing and reduce sustain for junglers because they can’t take the crab, specifically bad for new players in the jungle. For f**ks sake revert it!

In a majority of cases as you mention with \"This is a strategy made by the players and rarely anyone does it.\" unless I've misinterpreted it, few people actually go for the 2v2 scuttle fight, especially in lower elo. Mostly because they don't notice it going on, ignore it or don't want to risk giving the enemy a bigger lead. \n\n> You also realise this is bad for early game junglers, xin zhao jarvan iv etc. You are completely negating early game junglers so they become useless. \n\nIt's far from completely negating early junglers. Level 2 gankers can still gank level 2 and resume their jungle route, go for scuttle fights or invade against weaker early game champions. However it does grant slower junglers the opportunity to hit their necessary level 3 spike without losing control of the map by losing the crabs and takes some of the weight off mid lane in higher elos where the 2v2 would occur while mids were still level 1.\n\n> Then the change makes league very meta specific game because you are trying to bring tanks back in power by pulling the plug on other junglers and is unwelcoming. \n\nWhile they did give tanks a lovetap in the cinderhulk buff and nautilus got some of the power they removed a few seasons back, tanks remain average in the jungle overall. We do see a few hovering in the high tiers in sejuani, nunu and rammus. Rammus innately counters the auto attack heavy meta through his kit, sejuani through her armor steroid and nunu is purpose built to jungle, so it's unlikely he'll ever drop below good. They simply slot into the meta nicely compared to other tanks while being able to clear decently. \nWhile amumu is sitting up there as well, he's being built as an AP AOE nuke machine rather than a tank.\nThat leaves {{champion:54}} {{champion:57}} {{champion:111}} {{champion:516}} {{champion:14}} {{champion:223}} {{champion:154}} in pretty meh states with sub 50% winrates or play rates so low their statistics aren't recorded in the jungle.\n\n> Despite this if enemies manage to get a big lead, they will definitely prioritise scuttle a lot more and makes it even harder to find turning points in games.\n\nThis was already a problem pre change, in that the jungle champion who can best control the scuttle crabs controlled the game. Udyr being a prime example as the best duelist in the jungle, who has only 3 sub 50% winrates in the jg. Even by this standard the winrates aren't low enough to be called counters. This phenomenon is what saw the jungle champion pool shrink so drastically, with power farm/level 3 centric junglers essentially disappearing from the game, as they couldn't contest the scuttle crabs.\nThis hasn't changed and it doesn't make sense to change. If one is ahead, one will take every single advantage they can get to keep their lead.\n\n> You already ruin players jungle pathing and reduce sustain for junglers because they can’t take the crab, specifically bad for new players in the jungle\n\nThey generally overhaul jungle metas once or twice a year. Despite that, I'd hardly call this ruining jungle pathing, as they simply changed the first clear involving crab. So you simply replace crab with a camp. Eg red-bird-gank-crab-blue, a classic level 2 ganker route would now be red-bird-gank-wolf-blue. If once needs level 3 they clear any 4 camps. I feel you've drastically exaggerated the change to jungle pathing, or it highlights a distaste to adapting to meta shifts.\nAs for sustain, it should seldom be an issue even with the potion gone. Despite rocking Nautilus in the jungle, an F tier jungler since S5 I lack sustain issues. If you kite your camps and avoid drastically off meta junglers, you should have a healthy clear most games.\n\n\nWhile I understand your frustration with this change, people have been asking for this change for a long time (it's a huge trend on LoL's reddit, the NA/EU and EUW boards), many wanting scuttle crab completely removed due to how it strangles the amount of champions allowed to be viable.\n\n\nIf you find that you're struggling and unsure how to adapt your clear on a certain champ let me know, would be glad to offer an alternative clear  path.","replies":[{"poster":"dogsrule","date":"2019-05-04T23:38:46.105+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"{{champion:5}} {{champion:421}} {{champion:113}}  on both sides","replies":[{"poster":"TheSingularity","date":"2019-05-06T05:16:23.422+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hell hit me up if you want.

Easily the most frustrating change yet! For pretty much the reasons stated in original post, this is horrid, and especially when jg xp already super weak.\n\nEvery time I have any kind of option in this game, Riot smashes it down to make everyone do the same boring meta things, so they can keep just the right champs overtuned to sell sell skins. It's beyond galling to have the game and champs change ridiculously patch after patch. Read the patch notes, they are always talking about 'what they want' instead of what is broken. The two aren't even close to the same, and it's more obvious every patch. I don't know why Riot thinks I'm more likely to start playing the game more or spending money on it when it's different game every month. Who ever wanted a game when the rules and stats are constantly changing? Surely not the majority of any general player base?\n\nRiot, who even asked for this???? Please do something to appease those of us who are tired of being ignore EVERY SINGLE PATCH and just admit fault and hit revert button cleanly. One time.\n\nRiot:  You that bratty rich kid that thinks they the smartest person ever and everyone should do what they want.  I'm a grown adult, like many that play this game, with disposable income, I would HAPPILY just give you some money just to play if you would stop changing the game every patch.
