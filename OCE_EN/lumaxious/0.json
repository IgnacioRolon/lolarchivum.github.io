When I felt that the grind wasn't going quick enough (mainly when I found an expensive champion that I fell in love with) I would buy an IP boost. \n\nRunes were also like this (and still are, I only own half of them). The only downside was buying the started tier 3 runes (the ones that were permanently discounted last season). Recently, all tier 2 runes were made 1ip for purchase. this helps levelling accounts start experimenting early with runes and allows you to fill a page with only a few games. Tier 3 runes are more expensive, but it is a good deterrent from ranked, because if you haven't got at least 2 pages of tier 3 runes then you aren't ready for ranked (you will need to play a lot to be able to afford it, more playing,  better skill). \n\nAs for rune pages, there are regular 2-for-1 sales throughout the year. Saving up and waiting for those is fine. I have 16 rune pages and only use 2 of them on a regular basis. For almost all of the people I know, its pretty similar. \n\nOne thing I do miss, are the **double IP weekends** back in S4 or even the **party-up IP weekends** last season. \nPlaying in premade does give a slight IP advantage (hardly), and IP boosts are always available from the store. \nRiot should definitely give us the double IP weekends *more furious hinting at Riot*","replies":[{"poster":"Gr1fter","date":"2016-09-08T03:29:06.617+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yes, bring back the double IP weekend!!

But i remember back when i started (beta) the IP gain per game was way higher than it is now. Back in the day i could get a new character every week with only 3-4 games a day. Now i am sitting on 14000 ip after my last dump of ip into (i think i got a ton of new runes to update this old accounts runes) runes and champion shards i think for shits and giggles. \n\nThat 14000 was mainly wins (winrate went up massively since i started OTP'ing instead of picking randomly.) and was around 120 games. Average ip is around 90 for a win, with longer games with friends giving me an extra 20-30 ip. \n\nCompare this to my memory of 200 for playing solo for a win and 100 for a loss in pre-season 1 up until season 3. \n\nSure if you play with 4 other people, you are likely to get a ton more and all that jazz. But seriously i am an old player so i don't have it as bad.\n\nNow i started a 4th account for making it my primary ADC only account.. and i have to tell you, its not starting out good. I have level 14 and only unlocked the low IP costing champions. Not one 4500 or 6300 champion yet. So 14000 ip divided by 90 = 155.5 games to get. Which will only give you two 6300 characters. And i think more than half the champions in this game are 6300. That means you need over 2000 wins to get every champion that is including win of the day IF YOU GET IT. \n\nLets also remember this doesn't include runes. Which if you want all the popular runes (which i still see people play ranked WITHOUT RUNES), that is easily another 150 games you need just for 2 rune pages of runes if you are stingy with it. \n\nOh what about if you want to buy a new rune page? You want to test new rune pages out but not lose the others? Well that's another 6300ip. It really means if you average a champ OR a runepage every 77.7 games (if getting 90ip a game). \n\nI mean for someone who has over 15000 matches its fine. But new players.. never going to catch up if they can only play 4 games a night MAX. \n\nI think the IP gain WHILE LEVELING should be tripled at least and once they reach 30 (which you could get in around 300 matches now i was told) you  will have enough for some runes, at least 2 pages worth, and all the champions you find very interesting. Because right now i see people hit max and have 35 or so champs and start ranked with no runes.. its criminal i swear.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Sneed","date":"2016-09-08T00:00:49.208+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"runes should stay the same price alone, they should be discounted in a bundle (eg buying 9 at a time) though.\n\nand rune pages should be 4800, ip amount per gane dont need to change.","replies":[{"poster":"Lumaxious","date":"2016-09-08T00:30:25.202+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Sounds good, The pages are too expensive right now and having to toss up between a rune page or a champ is stupid, they say its not a P2P game yet they make it so buying rune pages with RP is 10x better and rune pages are essential.","replies":[{"poster":"Wess","date":"2016-09-08T00:33:26.757+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"More runepages would make it much easier to use the 'fill' option too!","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Lumaxious","date":"2016-09-08T00:21:54.036+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"That sounds a lot mere reasonable because rune pages right now are way too expensive and bundled runes would be really good and just help a lot with people progressing because there's a lot of people in bronze/silver not knowing if they should get runes or a new champ and it's kind of sad we have to do that, It's not a P2W game but people who buy champs with RP and the runes with IP have a very strong advantage because they can have a lot more damage, Regen or cooldown that just makes them A lot better in bronze to silver as far as I know, it's just a bit too much.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Wean","date":"2016-09-07T22:46:48.098+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Just get Hextech champion shards, one shard only costs 1700 IP.\nOnce you obtained 3 champion shards, click the shards to open them, click on one of the champion shards and select reroll, then select the other two champion shards and click the reroll button.\nA permanent champion will be displayed, and it doesn't cost any essences.\nIf you want to get only one champion out of those three champions, click on the other two champion shards and disenchant them so you get more essences, and then upgrade the remaining shard to champion permanent.\n3 champion shards costs less than 6300 IP.","replies":[{"poster":"Lumaxious","date":"2016-09-07T23:04:54.585+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You can do that but for people who are new that's a lot more expensive in the end for new people because you can get 1 with that but there's more champs that cost less than 6300 and you have a high chance of getting them, Also What about runes, that's a problem because runes help a lot and when you're trying out a character for the 1st time you're gonna want runes for them just so you have that bit extra help to help you learn that champ.","replies":[{"poster":"Wean","date":"2016-09-09T23:45:36.171+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"After you have rerolled the champions with the three champion shards you have, you can also retain the two remaining shards, and then you only need to buy one more shard to reroll, and keep going through the motions so that you get more champions faster.
