League at this level is not fun to play with random people.\r\n\r\nI just have 1 little thing to ask of people at the end of this, do you think when/if the voice chat is added it should be push to talk and you have to hold down the key to talk or no?","replies":[{"poster":"Fitzky","date":"2017-06-07T06:16:03.182+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Because 90% of the people in low elo smoke weed and use \"I'm high\" as an excuse for feeding.","replies":[{"poster":"PurpIe","date":"2017-06-07T08:03:03.127+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Fitzky,realm=OCE,application-id=T8eq2lFQ,discussion-id=x5hO8qjl,comment-id=0004,timestamp=2017-06-07T06:16:03.182+0000)\n>\n> Because 90% of the people in low elo smoke weed and use &quot;I&#x27;m high&quot; as an excuse for feeding.\n\nNever heard or seen of that excuse before","replies":[{"poster":"dragon poo","date":"2017-06-07T08:07:24.360+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Purplerain14,realm=OCE,application-id=T8eq2lFQ,discussion-id=x5hO8qjl,comment-id=00040000,timestamp=2017-06-07T08:03:03.127+0000)\n>\n> Never heard or seen of that excuse before\n\nmost of the high dude ive played with either pop off something fierce, or are playing aram because they dont want to play ranked high.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Ingénue","date":"2017-06-07T01:15:51.369+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The community in plat+ is also bad. \n\nPlaying league at any level is like playing russian roulette, you don't know if you are going to get toxic teammates. Luckily, just like russian roulette you don't have to participate in this. You can choose your teams, make friends and have fun! If you are unsure of where to look, try out the [Oceanic discord](https://discord.gg/trEHP8t), [Summoners Society facebook](https://www.facebook.com/groups/SummonersSocietyOCE/?fref=ts), or post right here on the team recruitment board! \n\nChoosing who you play with has so many benefits there isn't really any reason why you wouldn't (especially for players like yourself who play mainly norms).\n* You get slightly more IP for partying up\n* Increased chance of keys\n* You get chests when people in your party get an S grade\n* You can use voicechat and have a bit of fun\n* Get used to each others playstyles and maybe you can eventually take it to flex and gain your gold border and skin that way. \n\nAs for the voice chat, no idea ¯\\_(ツ)_/¯","replies":[]},{"poster":"He Meant Mine","date":"2017-06-06T17:38:10.240+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"People are so sensitive in low elo as well as pre lvl 30.

Then you are pretty clueless. Learn to adapt. Not AFK, the worst kind of toxic, since you pretty much threw the whole team under the bus. \n\nThe higher Elo has better gameplay, but still the same toxic shits. I've been in plat and near dia before, nothing change in attitude compare to silver. You might think challenger is best, but granted it only 200people; and out of those 200, 40-30 of them are probly toxic. \n\nIt just seem bronze and silver has alot more, cause you guys have the most population.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Dark Warrior","date":"2017-06-06T14:44:09.212+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Voice chat? mate Chinese players are so bad in this server, they tend not to talk in game, fkin abusing others in Chinese whole game and blaming those who speak in English lol, if voice chat included i can see whats going to happen, i would rather feed my game from now on than having these trolling chinese players in my team who fkin abusing all game and doing nothing, majority of them should delete of their account yes and it means 99% of these players, not only in gold elo but also Plat elo. i rather having a Vietnamese or Korean players than having fkin Chinese in my team, at least they can communicate and try to talk rather than abusing in their own language","replies":[]}]}
