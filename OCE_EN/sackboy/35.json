Wow. She got her armor and mr bonus removed for this.\nHer E no longer triggers Q (The worst idea in the world cause her E is waveclear and was her only method of effectively zoning, no one is scared if they are Q'd now even if they are low they can farm and she has to run around minions n sh*t to get a 60 dmg proc and then gets huge minion aggro.\nHer R recharge time is sh*t.\nHer Q base dmg got cut in half, for a later stronger AP ratio and she is a hybrid and the ratio sucks, you gain very little from hybrid items which are almost necessary on her (Gunblade).\nNo one buys Rageblade but if you do, heaven forbid - you shoulda bought AP like every other Akali\n\nAnd to top it all off they f*cked around with her stealthing until there was no point taking shroud, and I end all games with her with 5 leftover points unused.\n\nOh and I almost forgot her R range is now barely +100 on most carries normal auto range and she has to blow flash to land a 2nd R, rendering having 3 charges of it pointless. It also does no damage. F*ck knows why, maybe because I have to have 300 cs for my other skills to do damage, I'm not a late gamer and about the only thing I have going for me as Akali is I don't have to deal with Oracles anymore - enemies no longer get ward clear and reveal outta 1 item and shut me down with 1 item, they have to put in an investment or carry a pink.\n\nLate game however, with upgraded sweeping lense - which is where all these nerfs left her trying to scrape up a win is a permanent low cooldown reveal on her and takes no item slots so she is basically 9 feet deep.\n\nOh yeah they nerfed Gunblade too, and shaped it towards more AP which cut her in 6 different ways, Deathfire grasp is no longer available, Riot has added 0 hybrid items, tank items are everywhere, junglers more prominent than ever, her AP scaling boost didn't make up for her loss of base damage and the vamp of the item was in effect semi-useless afterwards because her base damages were so low the vamp on the item was un-necessary and to top it all off they nerfed the crap outta lich bane, the movespeed on it became semi-useless for her as most of her work was done in a small area of shroud and she has a (oh lord yay) speed boost already and can't roam for sh*t because of all of this and then they gave everyone free wards (thank you riot) and AOE became more prominent in the latest seasons so she is basically a -1/10 right now.\n\nShe can't farm either. She sits in the corner looking at morellos nerf bat solemly, awaiting some or any form of love or cherishment which probably wont take away the painful spot she is in stats/playability-wise.\n\nOh and she cant get CDR which is semi-aimless as an assassin but helped her Q bursting in a lot of cases (Deathfire stat) and energy regen runes take up 2 important slots to take (armor and MR which were removed from her shroud and would be great to take but because of this removal are untakeable).\n\nCould not count how many times morello hit her with the nerf bat, there were 600 different angles taken on her, over 2 seasons.\n\nBut thanks for releasing an Akali skin, I still play her I just think 900 nerfs from 600 angles was a bit much.\n\nShe relied on her shroud, now that you can get sweeping lense and upgrade it for a permanent oracles every so often they could quite easily revert the nerfs and she wouldn't be OP and pink wards are way harder to kill and have better placement options in the new jungle - on top of this the nerf on armor basically brought her to a stand still when it came to being an assassin or even playable.","replies":[{"poster":"Dawaraven","date":"2015-03-27T03:58:02.263+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"She was kinda broken when the shroud gave resistances, she was less broken before, but still a completely faceroll and not very fun to play against champ. When the answer is \"cc her till shes dead\", they usually arent balanced.\n\nI agree she is underpowered at the moment, they either need to revert the e proc change, or they need to give her a new e skill.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Chalze","date":"2015-03-25T08:30:53.347+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Sackboy,realm=OCE,application-id=Ntey9fRZ,discussion-id=fYQqhehc,comment-id=,timestamp=2015-03-24T03:22:01.371+0000)\n>\n> After you stomped her into the ground and made her **unviable**.\n\nDat single word was bait.\nI'm getting better at this lol","replies":[]}]}
