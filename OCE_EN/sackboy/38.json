The main issue is that the system is automated and therefor will be abused, like anything that's automated in any sense, but Riot is pretty much standing ground saying that the system works, and it does! It just has a lot of collateral damage. Which in its current state leave a lot of room for abuse, either way this will stick, but it's easier to exploit in automated features.\r\n\r\nBefore I continue I made another account, got it to level 5 and hit normals. I promptly told my team to report me for verbal abuse and that I wouldn't say anything, I'd still ping and still help.. just report me after the match is done, so it's not completely one-sided I asked the team after the match to do the exact same thing, it was working so far, I received the messages about being toxic and whatnot. After 7 games I logged off and slept, when I woke up I had a 22 game chat restriction. I laughed and new my test was over, despite not saying anything at all and being reported often enough was enough to get me chat restricted. Not one word said, nothing abusive and of course I won 6 of those 7. So it couldn't be that I was intentional feeding, that's how I know this system is flawed. But I cannot leave my research here!\r\n\r\nI continued with the account, this time being as positive and friendly as possible, I used each message as a gratitude thing, even saved one for a GG at the end or if we lost \"GG it was close, next time!\" I never corrected other players mistakes and filled each role, so I never instalocked or dodged games. After the match I said the same GG and honored those I believed deserved it, at the same time I never reported anyone; up to this point I'm 100% sure I was not reported once. Towards the end of the restrictions I had an enemy midlaner who fed intentionally, their toplaner went nuts because I killed him (at the point I didn't know he was feeding, I was feeding and poking him down). Anyway they were a 4 man and the guy feeding was the poor one who had to deal with it. Simply because I had no competition in midlane I had bother towers and about a 2.5k gold lead on the rest of them. When I roamed down to bot and killed them they simply resorted to calling me profanities and said that they were 4man reporting me for verbal abuse so I'd get chat restricted. And you better believe it worked! All positive games when I finished my chat restrictions I was hit with another 30.\r\n\r\nSo why did I target verbal abuse? I personally believe this one has higher mute potential, it's also what people use when mad! \"Yeah I died to you, but enjoy your chat restriction\" 9/10 you were reported for verbal abuse. This is the automated system in place and that our future games are essentially in the hands of our enemies and allies if we fail to perform like a LCS player. I don't feel this can be fixed without the Tribunal, not that I was a fan of that anyway. As I said earlier, it's good on paper, but bad in practice -- and that's simply because being so limited in what you can say will make or break a good teammate. Everytime you say something you take the risk of losing a teamfight because of it. Communication dies and for a team game that just ruins the spirit, and with the limited pings. You cannot ask for wards to be placed, cannot ask for buffs as no one seems to understand that the \"I'm on my way\" ping means you want it.\r\n\r\nSeeing as this is a discussion, what is your thoughts on chat restrictions? Ever been muted wrongly or always had a good impression and experience? :)","replies":[{"poster":"Hot Pope","date":"2015-02-06T13:28:56.606+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"you had asked them and also, repetitive reports by different people means something's up.","replies":[]},{"poster":"ESP Azamalaza","date":"2015-02-05T19:27:08.411+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"hi, you asked them to report you and they did that is your fault, if you had not had prior chat restrictions then  a 4 man report wouldnt of done anything, a normal everyday league player who isnt toxic wont get chat restrictions their system works and u gotta accept it or i will use my zap gun on a tree","replies":[{"poster":"Sackboy","date":"2015-02-06T04:46:58.975+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=ESP Azamalaza,realm=OCE,application-id=Ntey9fRZ,discussion-id=yhANREvo,comment-id=0003,timestamp=2015-02-05T19:27:08.411+0000)\n>\n> hi, you asked them to report you and they did that is your fault, if you had not had prior chat restrictions then  a 4 man report wouldnt of done anything, a normal everyday league player who isnt toxic wont get chat restrictions their system works and u gotta accept it or i will use my zap gun on a tree\n\nI think you missed the memo, I knew what I was doing I was testing purely if they search the chat for abuse or just mute based on reports, and it's fully the latter. And if you're chat restricted they seem to think no matter what you're toxic and even a few reports will add more chat restrictions to your account. I wouldn't go as far as to say I'm toxic, I just overuse swear words and hence people think I'm abusing them them when I honestly don't even think, but I wanted to see how the mutes were handed out -- and it appears they're handed out abused on reports not actual abuse, therefor this will be heavily exploited, not that it isn't already.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Project Xayah","date":"2015-02-05T10:53:32.928+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Personally I've never been hit with a chat restriction. That said, I'm unaware of if I have been reported for that.

Based on your experience with that other account it does seem it is quite abuse-able, I may do something similar to see the results first hand.\n\nOne thing we need to consider though is that the tribunal is probably still a fair way off, if it ever does come back, so it does seem like a good idea for Riot to do something about the system currently in place. That said I doubt Riot would start having their support staff manually going through each report of verbal abuse and the chat logs of those games. One possible solution could be a system that detects whether you have used chat in a game, and in champ select and the post game, and even search for key words/phrases that could be associated with verbal abuse.","replies":[{"poster":"Sackboy","date":"2015-02-06T04:49:10.948+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=HeartVine,realm=OCE,application-id=Ntey9fRZ,discussion-id=yhANREvo,comment-id=0001,timestamp=2015-02-05T10:53:32.928+0000)\n>\n> Personally I've never been hit with a chat restriction.

Also congratulations on never being chat restricted. :D","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"22 5 19 20 1","date":"2015-02-05T11:49:01.050+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"same with leavebuster","replies":[]},{"poster":"Best Viktor AU","date":"2015-02-05T10:35:36.768+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I get reported for verbal abuse when i send 3-4 messages the whole game.
