Her spell shield and great ultimate followed up by the righteous glory meta on tanks creates amazing engage for fights. Kalistas rend stacks do almost nothing in the current tank meta unless she gets many stacks on her tank target. Ashe is growing in the meta as well because of having that long range engage which allows her to not have to get to the tanks which can lock her down. Although Ashe lacks mobility her kite potential is amazing against the tank meta. Corki isn't all that strong currently because like Kog maw. He's more of a poke Adc and sitting on those tri-force procks. And btw if theyre god tier it doesn't mean that they are the only adcs viable currently. Any Adc can do good in its job if the player has enough skill. Even Urgot is being played in the LCS at the current point in time, even though being regarded by millions by the \"worst champion in the game\"\n\nâ€”Riso","replies":[]}]}
