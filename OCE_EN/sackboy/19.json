I realize some Rioters absolutely hated NA GD, and some loved it. It even expanded enough for F.E.K to be born and changed the forum massively. GD returned to the boards on NA, and let's not lie, GD was 99.95% of the total forum, it was the most popular and active section of each forum (NA, EUW & OCE).\r\n\r\nAt the end of the day GD was a place to chill out and meet people, due to how laid back the moderation was, #BringBackGeeDee2014.","replies":[{"poster":"Molendo","date":"2014-11-27T06:38:07.692+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Or they could just have a miscellaneous and a GD?","replies":[]},{"poster":"Klavinmour","date":"2014-11-27T01:33:10.455+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":2,"body":"Except Miscellaneous is far more lenient of a topic than General Discussion was.
