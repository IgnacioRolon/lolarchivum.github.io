Funny joke, Riot.","subforum":"Miscellaneous","up_votes":3,"down_votes":5,"body":"Hilarious, but can you please fix them? Seeing as you know, you nerfed a small amount of AP assassins and then you removed DFG! And the only 'nerf' Zed got was a very minor attack speed nerf, which is irrelevant towards him seeing as his core items both give mass amounts of AS. But then you proceed to nerf more AP assassins and yet again leave the guy who is king of midlane at the moment alone. This is Lee Sin all over again! Zed is a low-risk, high-reward assassin, something Kassadin got gutted for. Aside from this he has 'free' wave clear, insane early game damage that spikes at 6, in order to counter his ultimate you need Zhonya's or you will either blow flash or die. Zed has the best waveclear in the game, as well as it being 'free'.\r\n\r\nBut the icing on the cake is his insane mobility, his shadows last for way to long allowing for easy juking, escaping, chasing whatever he wants to do ,Zed can do it. Why is he still in his current state while you nerf all others?","replies":[{"poster":"Crusader charlie","date":"2015-02-25T23:24:01.638+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"yeah lets remove zeds shadows actually. good idea.\ni think we could also remove turrets from the games and make it a first person shooter.\nwhile we are mentioning crazy ideas","replies":[{"poster":"Sackboy","date":"2015-02-26T04:58:22.245+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Crusader charlie,realm=OCE,application-id=Ntey9fRZ,discussion-id=7ETJe1Mn,comment-id=0003,timestamp=2015-02-25T23:24:01.638+0000)\n>\n> yeah lets remove zeds shadows actually. good idea.\n> i think we could also remove turrets from the games and make it a first person shooter.\n> while we are mentioning crazy ideas\n\nLearn to read please.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Unseen Predator","date":"2015-02-25T07:57:11.734+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Looks like someone got his ass kicked by a Zed.\n\nZed is balanced, maybe you should get better at the game?","replies":[{"poster":"Sackboy","date":"2015-02-25T08:12:19.412+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=NigguhDamus,realm=OCE,application-id=Ntey9fRZ,discussion-id=7ETJe1Mn,comment-id=0001,timestamp=2015-02-25T07:57:11.734+0000)\n>\n> Looks like someone got his ass kicked by a Zed.\n> \n> Zed is balanced, maybe you should get better at the game?\n\nStfu Zed main.","replies":[{"poster":"Unseen Predator","date":"2015-02-25T09:13:02.871+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Rengar main but ok.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Olee","date":"2015-02-25T07:31:15.565+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Sackboy,realm=OCE,application-id=Ntey9fRZ,discussion-id=7ETJe1Mn,comment-id=,timestamp=2015-02-25T07:13:27.111+0000)\n> **Zed has the best waveclear in the game**\n\nLol","replies":[]},{"poster":"Project Xayah","date":"2015-02-25T08:17:14.739+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Pretty good April fool's, eh?","replies":[]}]}
