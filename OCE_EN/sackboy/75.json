you cant do %%%% about it.\nLee Sin: Gonna %%%% your jungler all game with my unlimited counterplay and mobility, tank like base stats and assassin like damage.\nUdyr: QWEWREWRQEWREWREWRQEWRQERQW PENTA KILL!\nNidalee: Eat my 800 damage spears on a 3 second cool down (when more than half go invis) then I'll cougar form you and 100/0 you.\nZed: Just gonna go udyr mode for a sec then teleport back to my shadow because I'm a low risk high reward champion that instantly wins midlane.","replies":[{"poster":"Chalze","date":"2015-03-10T14:24:33.143+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":">

tank-like base stats and assassin-like damage early game...you don't abuse it then you'll fall of late (unless you're int he LCS or something)\nUdyr's a shthead\nWell getting 800 damage from spears is better than receiving around 1300~1500 from old Nidalee...\nZed can't always rely on his R to \"escape\"...so many people who aren't brain dead are beginning to wait for him to swap back...including me :D You should too :)","replies":[]},{"poster":"RNG Remilia","date":"2015-03-10T10:07:58.900+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I was about to flame the sht out of you for being thick but
