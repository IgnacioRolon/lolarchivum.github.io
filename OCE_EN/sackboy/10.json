I leave because if i stay I'll end up abusing people, I know myself enough to know me leaving is better in the end then abusing 4 people and making everyone feel like crap, but this.. this doesn't teach me anything. I complained about it before. Seems the timer keeps adding up which is just going to irritate me before the game even starts.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"RNG Remilia","date":"2015-01-08T20:15:58.939+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Could always just leave LoL running in the background of another game and tab in every few minutes to move around so you don't get kicked for being AFK?","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Rok","date":"2015-01-08T20:48:54.188+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"/mute all and move on.
