Yes, Jinx is popular and one of the few best ADC's in the game, but her power comes from her siege potential, Jinx top will shred the top laner instantly and have all three of their towers down before 15 minutes. Making her ult do that little damage is a kick in the face, seeing as 9/10 her ult doesn't even go off as it has an animation that takes fucking hours to complete.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Wumachine","date":"2015-04-28T11:23:51.292+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"sorry cant hear you over draven half healthing scrubs with his ult","replies":[{"poster":"KingDinger","date":"2015-04-30T08:53:33.663+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Maximum Physical Damage (two hits): 350 / 550 / 750 (+ 220% bonus AD) \n\n    Maximum Physical Damage: 250 / 350 / 450 (+ 100% bonus AD) (+ 25 / 30 / 35% of enemies' missing health)\n\nthing is, draven needs to hit with both sides....jinx only needs around the range of her ZAP! for her max damage and what? 1500 missing HP for hers to start outscaling his.\n\nstill, his is deceptively strong...when i used to play draven it never really seemed like a huge damage hit...but thats quite nice. still, not exactly easy to hit twice even at point blank range. where jinx ult is being nerfed. anything past her AA range when normal (500? 525?) and its already doing the same damage as before...","replies":[{"poster":"Wumachine","date":"2015-04-30T09:39:40.539+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"we're talking about ulting at point blank..... max range means nothing, and draven can just double tap r to get two hits with his ult, reducing jinxs ult to a pitiful 25 damage at rank 1? {{item:31.....","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"BarryButcher","date":"2015-04-25T08:24:05.152+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Her Ult will do fuk all damage at point blank range now but does the same amount of damage at max range.\n\nJust FYI, max damage of jinx ult is once it goes past her Zap range apparently.

Kalista is short-medium, Draven is short-medium, Tristina is all depending on the period of the match.\n\nJinx is far from short-medium ranged, if the ability effects her range, then it effects her overall range group.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Niji","date":"2015-04-25T07:02:27.531+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"ayy lomo","replies":[]}]}
