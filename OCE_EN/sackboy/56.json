Your mum sent me her digits last night while I was beating Scarra and HotshotGG with my eyes closed, didn't even ward I just knew where they where. Just that good, and your little sister has pictures of me in her room on posters and all that jazz, makes you mad that I'm in your house and you cannot even get up and leave the room.\n\nBut what makes me great is the fact I can play every role at #1 challenger spot level, without even trying. Someone told me they'd see me at the top and I just laughed and said sure buddy, you just bronze trash, like the peasants on the OCE boards. They all over me man, downvoting my threads, ignoring my knowledge of the game, I was just trying to help them get a foot in the door, but they're not gonna abuse freelosandra. But that's fine, all this LP and ELO gains, while I'm getting gains in the gym, getting gains in league and getting gains in your mum. I don't ever buy pink wards when versing champions like Twitch, because even if he does sneak up on him I'll just drop him like I'm gonna drop the bass on my next tracks.\n\nAnd you hating, 'cause you want all this, and the bronze life was good until I showed up and sat on your #1 player, I'm to good for this game, should be called League of Sackboy. Not only is my LP 7503 in Challenger, I have millions in my bank from all these people paying me to advertise their clothes and stuff but I never do, what are they gonna do? Nothing. Everyone knows me, face it, I made it. Your sister loves me more than she loves Justin Bieber and One Direction combined, secretly you were wishing you were a 10/10 female so you could some of this, but never 'cause even if you were a female I only mess with girls that are good at the game, nothing below challenger, everyone else is trash.\n\nYou're all jokes, and I'm sitting here laughing at all of you.","replies":[{"poster":"Chalze","date":"2015-03-12T06:47:28.283+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"*#justsackboysh!t*","replies":[]},{"poster":"hðnkƒørÇªmíllè","date":"2015-03-12T05:19:21.966+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Join richgang sackgirl please.

But that's cool, not everyone can be as talented and gifted as me, I was gonna join Rich Gang, with my hood bars and verses that are straight fire, but they told me. They told me that I am to good at everything and if I was there it'd be ruined, jealous. So I was like whatever and went to join YMCMB but then I realized Lil' Wayne is faker than this server and peaced out like A$AP rocky. $ackboy don't mess with these merk ass posers, just shot straight to the top. No time for even co-signing, nothing, just straight there.\n\nI didn't even play freelosandra, I was just trying help you bronze trash get up there, but you don't want to be good, as you have accepted the fact you will always be trash and when I step in the building, you better get out. Don't you breathe my air, peasant.","replies":[{"poster":"hðnkƒørÇªmíllè","date":"2015-03-12T06:04:36.976+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"nah u luv mi ","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Foster My People","date":"2015-03-12T04:07:29.740+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"winning","replies":[]}]}
