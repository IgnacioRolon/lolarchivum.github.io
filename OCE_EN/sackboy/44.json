If you walked around alone without a pinkward then she would kill you, or make you burn flash and then laugh as you were limping in the next team fight. Akali could dash the ADC, kill them then stealth as her team came in. She was disruptive, but fragile and if she was so much as targeted for even a second without her stealth she would die. I like to compare Akali and Katarina, as they both have the same playstyle, wait then go in and don't get CC'd.\n\nAkali's early game was the worst in the League, but her lategame was amazing, Akali did badly in midlane, and top was too tanky for her to get kills and snowball, therefore she had to turret hug all early game, until she hit 6, then had a big advantage as she had a gapcloser and could trade without getting hit. Even at 6 if she was versing LeBlanc, or Ahri she was done until she started to get items, beating Akali was just shoving hard before she hit 6 then playing safe, once she hit three she had a mini powerspike, so you had to watch for that, but most other assassins had a better level 3 anyway.\n\nRiot finally allowed her to proc her Q with her E, which allowed her to trade and last hit better, it was a blessing and it was more of a QoL thing than a buff, Akali was a squishy melee assassin in a lane versing ranged mages, last hitting was solely relied on Q, which is unreliable and it cost Akali so much CS as she got hit if she had to melee or E the wave. Deep down I knew she'd be nerfed sometime, she did her job amazing until high ELO where people actually had brains and knew how to counter her, she was known as the bronze stomper, because she ruined anyone who had no idea how to play. And bronze/silver is a huge majority of the game, Riot caters to them, instead of trying to help them learn, they nerf anyone who stomps them.\n\nYou know you fucked up when you nerfed a champion to much (who was complained about often)  when everyone is begging for them to be buffed, I never thought I'd see the day when I saw people supporting an Akali buff, but you fucked her Riot, you gave everyone free pink wards, free true-vision which ruined Twitch and Akali, that's why Twitch has fallen off, his stealth is utter shit now, if an Akali or Twitch is in a game you can bet the entire team has the free pink ward and sweeper. But, I can deal with that.. I just have to play smarter, but then you removed DFG (ty bless Riot, you fucked every AP Assassin and then lied saying no one was effected by it) and then you nerfed Akali twice, back to back. What the fuck, she was nerfed 4 times in a row essentially. We all know why Zed hasn't been touched, he makes flashy plays, just like fucking Lee Sin.\n\nYou're gimping the fucking triangle, ADC > Tank > Assassin > ADC\nBut you nerfed assassins so now it's ADC > Tank > Assassin or ADC > Tanks > Zed > ADC as godfuck Zed is the only assassin that hasn't been stomped into the ground.\n\nFix your shit Riot, and fucking fire ghostcrawler before he makes all ADC's OP as fuck, which will happen as he's a bias fucker.","replies":[{"poster":"Lord Kylar Alice","date":"2015-03-26T06:19:51.745+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Sackboy,realm=OCE,application-id=Ntey9fRZ,discussion-id=O05aTojf,comment-id=,timestamp=2015-03-26T01:00:58.975+0000)\n>\n> We all know why Zed hasn't been touched, he makes flashy plays\n\nJust want to point out that Zed's been nerfed many, many times.\n\nOn another note, Akali is still ridiculous, she's just not as ridiculous as before.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Mugen","date":"2015-03-26T06:32:22.156+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"didnt play akali since nerfs until the new skin came out and finally felt the nerfs. The ult range nerf was kind of alright but may cause you to blow the additional flash to finish them off but the worst of all was the q proc removal on e. The level 3 powerspike which made laning a tad bit easier from the pressure of the proc was so vital but now it just feels so clunky, its just a spell that doesnt sync well at all with her kit now :(","replies":[]},{"poster":"Mar3thyu","date":"2015-03-26T01:27:51.228+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Talon and Diana are still good picks for assassins.\nTalon weak early but can poke and cs with w, E allows you to engage when your jg comes to gank as a 99% slow is huge and should allow them to get there cc off, Ult can be used to escape ganks 35 CD at lvl 3 and 35% cdr.
