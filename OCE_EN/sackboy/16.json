The biggest issue is that nobody ( that ive seen for years now ) plays her as she was originally designed , as an AP carry. She is exclusively picked as a support champ. Supports arent supposed to have that level of burst AND easily spamable stun. Its basically a guaranteed kill in lane if she lands her stun , as her burst will be enough to set you up for an easy finish for her ADC. Change her skills , or drop her ratios into the dirt. Or just change her passive so she can only stun with tibbers? There isnt really any other champ capable of doing what she is doing atm.","replies":[{"poster":"Jink","date":"2015-07-27T00:35:04.440+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kypy3vbyecA","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"BarryButcher","date":"2015-03-22T03:07:10.759+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"They nerfed Tibbers damage on PBE already.
