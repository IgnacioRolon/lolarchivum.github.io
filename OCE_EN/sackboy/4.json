There are worse champions out there requiring nerfs.\n\nIn all honesty I think a compromise should be a silence is applied on the mimic version's sigil of malice.

She'd get something while also kind of losing something (ult freedom to have to use the silence if she wanted it)","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Garens Harem","date":"2015-01-07T08:45:16.673+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"her q should stun and slow","replies":[]}]}
