His capability to crit early is borderline OP. I don't think there is a champion in this game that can successfully duel a Tryndamere (I acknowledge that there might be a few yes, but not many). \n- You can't lifesteal from him when he uses his ult, as your attacks have no life to steal from him since they are dealing no damage. \n- His slow makes fleeing from him ridiculously hard, on the verge of impossible, which is also followed up by a damaging gap closer. \nNot to mention his slow reduces anyone that is near him, their AD by a flat amount, boosting his advantage on any target really. \n\nEven if you are beating a Tryndamere in a fight, he gains AD based on missing health, so you are only digging your grave essentially, until he presses that R and goes super saiyan unkillable. Late game gets out of hand, when he can virtually one shot squishy carries like they are nothing. The only thing that balances this champion at the moment in my opinion, is the fountains ability to bypass his ult, because that is the only safe place on the map from a Tryndamere.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Lnar","date":"2015-01-11T17:24:24.709+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"played as a tryn v sion the other day.\nGot destroyed. it's all about the counterpicks - if your team is stupid and picks a bunch of non-useful champs v tryn, then yeah you're going to get annihilated .\nThe best way to deal with a tryn is to build tanky straight away, rush a thornmail and then just zone him from farming.
