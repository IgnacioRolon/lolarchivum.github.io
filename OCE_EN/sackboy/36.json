As your clock runs faster than intended, and because some older hardwares will fail to report and update this to the game engine, it results in your game run faster than intended.\n\nThey should just add a software clock inside the game but probably not do-able without relying on hardwares tho.\n\nOr maybe do a check on the timer between the server and client, and updates the client's game clock by multiplying the necessary factor to make them equal, and set this check to perform every time you log in.","replies":[]}]}
