I had a very large number of runes, and am a little surprised at this unusually exact number.  Did I really just happen to have exactly 100,000 BE worth of runes, or was there a maximum cap on how much could be converted?  Is this actually a bonus for having so many?  I'm confused!\n\nVacuum Chamber","replies":[{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2017-11-09T03:50:47.182+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I believe it rounded to the nearest 10k when they did the conversion, I got exactly 40k, and everyone I've talked to got an exact number as well, so I'd say they did it that way for easy readability and you got lucky with the clean 100 :P","replies":[]}]}
