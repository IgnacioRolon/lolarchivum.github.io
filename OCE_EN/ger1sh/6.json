I got a reply from Riot and unfortunately it makes no sense to me. \nHere is what i sent them as a ticket. \n\nMe:\nI ordered two items from the merch store, a Lulu figure and a 'Urf and Random Figure' combo. When the package arrived it did contain the Lulu and Urf figure but it didn't actually have a random figure included. What processes can I go through to resolve the situation of being able to get my bonus random figure from the Urf package.\n\nRiot:\nIt's me Hidden Ki from the Billing Team! We apologize for the confusion on your invoice, during my investigation I discovered that it was caused by an error script stored in the program we use to send order confirmations and invoices for post-checkout communication. We hope you enjoy the discounted price from your figures, but if you would like to return the items for a full refund, we are also happy to assist.\n\nIf you have any other questions or concerns, please feel free to contact us again.\n\nI dunno if  I'm missing something but I dont know how this is meant to help me get my random figure :(","replies":[]}]}]}
