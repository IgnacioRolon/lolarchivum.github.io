The game did in fact just disappear and I did not loose my promos as a result of this  phantom 'drop hack' (if thats what happened) thing. What happened was i check my profile which said g2 91LP so i just assumed i lost the series because of it. When in actuality because it was g3 of the series and i had lost a game, the profile sort of records a lost game within a series as an lp loss. \n\nWent on to win the next game and I'm g1 now!","replies":[{"poster":"Talon12","date":"2015-07-26T23:25:33.918+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"this happens when ranked servers go down","replies":[]},{"poster":"Mindstar","date":"2015-07-27T03:44:30.106+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey Ger1sh\n\nThanks for the report.
