In 2009, Riot released its debut title to critical and player acclaim. As the most played PC game in the world, over 67 million play every month.","url":"http://www.riotgames.com/careers/25634","image":"http://riotgames.com/sites/all/themes/riot/media/images/draven_darious.jpg"},"up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"Riot is hiring! \r\n\r\nIncluded in the application are a few thought provoking questions about the current state and future of eSports in Oceania. I thought it could be interesting to collectively dive into the questions being asked and  see what kind of responses we can come up with. This post is focused around question one and I will be uploading responses to each of the questions one by one. \r\n\r\nEach question is really focused and you could literally write an entire essay for each question. I&#039;ve included my thoughts on the first question as sort of a catalyst to get the discussion rolling. I apologise for the dry nature of my writing - I&#039;m a Uni student, damn you academia!\r\n\r\n**What are your thoughts on Riot&rsquo;s current Oceanic eSport strategies?**\r\n\r\ntl;dr - \r\nIn order to produce a solid answer for this question, you would need to consider two things; \r\nWhat does Riot want to achieve with their current Oceanic eSport strategies? And\r\nWhat does Riot mean when they say eSports?\r\n\r\nWell let&rsquo;s start off with ironing out a clear definition of eSports. I think a lot of peoples &lsquo;knee jerk&rsquo; reaction (myself included) would be that eSports is simply the professionalization of play &ndash; in this case players who are being paid to play League of Legends in a competitive environment. But it&rsquo;s only when you really stop and think about it that eSports is so much more than that. I ultimately think that a true definition of eSports &ndash; one that truly captures the whole scene - needs to incorporate the interaction between professional players, developers/producers and spectatorial followers. This is because if there were no players who developed their own competencies and skills in playing computer games, it is unlikely that the practice of watching and/or the practices of governing eSports would have emerged and been sustained. Likewise, if there was no subculture of spectatorial followers, there would be less motivation to perform eSports competitively, and there would be less need for governance organisations to institutionalise the practice. Therefore when thinking about Riot&rsquo;s current Oceanic eSport strategies we have to approach this question with the mind-set that the notion of eSports is brought to life by the interactions that occur between a bunch of different &ndash; but intricately connected &ndash; groups and individuals. \r\n\r\nNow that we have a clear understanding of eSports we can reflect on Riot&rsquo;s current Oceanic eSport strategies. However in order to effectively reflect on these strategies, we need to first identify what goals and aspirations Riot set out to achieve with the implementation of these strategies. Based on some of the research I did the ultimate goal of Riot&rsquo;s Oceanic eSport strategies seemed to be focused around creating an awesome experience for the spectator for both live and broadcasted events.  Additionally there are a bunch of different sub-goals that fit nicely under the umbrella of creating an awesome experience for the spectator, such as increasing viewership, sponsorship and tournament prize pools. Utilizing this notion of creating an awesome experience for the spectator as a fundamental overarching goal for Riot&rsquo;s current Oceanic eSport strategies we can now endeavour to reflect on the effectiveness of the avenues Riot undertook to achieve these goals. \r\n\r\nACCESSABILITY \r\n\r\nImplementing a point of access into the in-game client for professional matches proved to be an effective tool that made eSports simply more accessible to the spectator. In the same way that being a professional League of Legends player requires a specific set of skills and expertise, being a spectator of professional League of Legends matches also embodies this notion of requiring a specific set of skills and expertise. In order to access competitive League of Legends games you need a specific set of skills that allows you to navigate towards and through the streaming software where the broadcast is being delivered. Therefore, even if an individual is attracted to eSports, it can be quite difficult for them to translate that attraction into something tangible like viewership because they may not necessarily possess the required set of skills to access eSports. However by implementing a point of access into the in-game client for professional matches Riot is seemingly bypassing this requirement of the spectator. The end result is step closer towards fulfilling Riot&rsquo;s ultimate goal with its current eSport strategies - creating an awesome experience for the spectator.  \r\n\r\nHARNESSING PARTICIPATION TO INCREASE VIEWERSHIP\r\n\r\nFantasy Leagues, tipping competitions and even OPL summoner icons all contribute to creating a participatory culture around eSports. As spoken about earlier, eSports really needs to be thought about as a culture of participation and by harnessing this notion of spectator participation Riot can make inroads towards creating a more appealing spectatorial experience. By creating various paths for audience participation Riot are opening up avenues for individuals to express their interest in eSports in a variety of ways. In other words, the various experiences being offered up by Riot - that allows individuals to engage with eSports - ultimately works to collectively nurture an emerging eSports scene in the Oceanic region. I know I personally feel obligated to scream out EGym &ndash; in the same way you&rsquo;d scream out Madlife when landing a Thresh hook - every time I make a sweet play on Alistar simply because; 1) EGym is an Alistar God and 2) I&rsquo;m rocking my Legacy summoner icon. When you combine this notion of Riot appealing to the participatory nature of eSports, with its outlined goals of creating an awesome experience for the viewer, you would have to conclude that Riot&rsquo;s current eSport strategies are taking steps towards creating a space for eSports in Oceania. \r\n\r\nI put the brakes on here because I started to get worried about length (which seems like something odd to say after writing these huge blocks of text). But what have I overlooked? I want your input.\r\n\r\nCheers,\r\nGer1sh","replies":[{"poster":"Ger1sh","date":"2015-04-18T02:36:51.260+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Here's another point.\n\nCreate entrepreneurial opportunities for pro players by raising their profile\n\nThis ones pretty straightforward. In order to grow the eSports scene in Oceania, pro players must have some sort of presence in the community. At first this is something Riot needs to facilitate and to its credit the ongoing coverage they've given pro players (previews, reviews, opinion pieces, interviews) has done an 'ok' job of introducing/reinforcing  pro players within the community. But there is a point where pro players need to take it upon themselves and build upon the foundation Riot has created and work to raise their own profile through the tonne of social media options.\n\nIn a funny way this idea of pro player entrepreneurship could easily be spoken about in some of the other questions - specifically the ones that want to start a discussion about what is holding the scene back.\n\nAnyway. Moar to come\n\nCheers,\nGer1sh","replies":[]}]}
