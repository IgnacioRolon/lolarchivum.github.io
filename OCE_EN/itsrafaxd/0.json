Once I got into the loading screen, I was hit with a few error messages.  I just clicked &#039;Ok&#039; a few times and I kept getting the same error messages. Since the game wasn't going to load, I exited the Alpha Client and opened the normal League of Legends client, logged in and was able to load into the game. Unfortunately, as i got into the game my team had already voted for a remake and I took a loss. Does anyone know how to fix it so that I can load into a game with the Alpha Client and play?\n{{item:3070}} {{item:3070}} {{item:3070}}\n\n**Link to error messages**\nhttps://imgur.com/a/LvjtE\n\nEdit: I fixed it, the problem was Overwolf and some apps such as lolwiz. I just shut down Overwolf and everything worked just fine.","replies":[]}
