When level 6 and 7 were first released you could get tokens on any mode. I got my Quinn tokens while playing Definitely Not Dominion. But yeah due to champion performance and play rates varying wildly on other modes, and the lack of data in comparison to SR, standard SR modes were made the only way to obtain tokens shortly after that.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Sanpatsu","date":"2018-08-18T04:47:59.856+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Bit strange that you can get mastery point but no tokens. i have the same problem as you{{champion:157}}","replies":[]},{"poster":"Asurine","date":"2018-08-16T12:33:41.054+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yea you don't get them.

As has always been the case, earning mastery points is possible in all PvP Matchmade modes (ranked/normals [both SR and TT], ARAM, featured etc), but you're only eligible to earn mastery *tokens* in Ranked and Normal (blind and draft) modes on Summoners Rift.\n\nYou can find more information on the Champion Mastery system by heading over to the [Champion Mastery Guide](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/204211284) on the Support site.","replies":[]}]}
