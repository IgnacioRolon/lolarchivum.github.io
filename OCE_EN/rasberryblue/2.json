I would go mid and supp equally so i guess the choice is really just between the power of the two champions. So can I know who is currently more powerful please? :D","replies":[{"poster":"Gesteppie","date":"2015-12-01T15:28:08.639+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"A champion shouldn't be bought based on power.

Pick her up.\n\nVlad really needs to be considerate of the team composition, as he brings no cc and top laners usually bring a little bit of that that can turn games. Vlad's game changer is his ult damage and really, it is not always noticeable if the other team is really far ahead while Leona can do heaps for her team with her passive damage and cc that, generally speaking in most situations won't really lose value if the team is behind.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Maraudaur","date":"2015-12-02T03:27:12.984+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Depends do you want a magic damage focused top laner? or do you prefer playing tanky cc heavy supports?","replies":[{"poster":"RasberryBlue","date":"2015-12-02T05:46:42.166+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I think i would prefer supporting.

But he usually can't lock down an enemy (no stuns or snares) and he usually can't enter a fight first as he isn't super tanky.\n\nHowever Leona doesn't deal damage and can't really hold her own in a lane. But she has a lot of stuns which can lock down enemies, she can jump into a fight first to engage team fights, she can peel for allies with her stuns AND her passive also makes her allies stronger.\n\nBoth are strong and weak depending on what you are looking for. You can't clearly say one champion is better than the other because this game has 5 positions and some champions fill specific roles.\n\nIt all comes down to what do you want to do for your team?\n\nDo you want to deal damage and disrupt team fights with a magic user? or do you want to jump in tank damage and stun people as a support tank?","replies":[{"poster":"RasberryBlue","date":"2015-12-02T11:15:15.770+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"thank you for your advice, :D. i think i would probably unlock Leona for I enjoy supporting  better :D","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"JasonWazza","date":"2015-12-01T12:40:30.476+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Well Vlad can go top as well if you need to be top laning.\n\nThe better question you should ask is, which role do you have more other favorite champs in?","replies":[]}]}
