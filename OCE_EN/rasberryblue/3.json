But my friend played league much earlier than I did and told me to buy runes instead of champions when I reach level 20. I really want to unlock a champion, maybe jinx or kindred but my friend keeps on urging me to get runes instead. Should I get runes or champions?","replies":[{"poster":"fattyhotdogs","date":"2015-10-31T01:28:54.149+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Runes bro.

Same goes for every other lane matchup. \n\nFor example my adc rune setup is 18 flat AD and the rest flat armor ( my rune setup for adc is a bit away from the norm ,  im sacrificing some MR for more AD for stronger trades an better last hitting ) . point is thats almost two swords worth of extra AD starting the lane at lvl 1. And if you didnt have the right runes for your adc , youd be coming into the lane at a serious disadvantage.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Vilemaw Bot","date":"2015-10-31T05:14:35.947+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"runes: 6300ip=0.000001% armour pen\nchampion: 6300ip=fun","replies":[{"poster":"JasonWazza","date":"2015-10-31T06:17:55.367+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Except this isn't the case\n\nAD marks: 9 gives 8.5 AD for 918 IP\n\nFact is runes are basically required or you put yourself too far behind (about 2k gold in stats minimum.)","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"JasonWazza","date":"2015-10-31T03:10:32.097+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thing is you can't really get by without just a standard AD page and a Standard AP page\n\nStandard AD page: AD reds, Armor yellows, MR blues, AD quints\nStandard AP page: Magic pen Reds, Armor yellows, MR blues, AP Quints.\n\nOnce you have that feel free to buy a champion, because you will have bare minimum what you always need.\n\nBut there is a lucky side for you, they cheapened all the runes that are standard, so you get cheaper runes.","replies":[{"poster":"Nijel","date":"2015-10-31T04:06:23.169+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":">But there is a lucky side for you, they cheapened all the runes that are standard, so you get cheaper runes.\n\nNot like back in our day where you had to fight tooth and nail for every darn rune you could get!","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Epica","date":"2015-10-31T02:34:39.538+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Runes over champions always, best thing to do is get a standard AD page first because there are so many champions you can play with it, then get either an AP page or a Defensive page.","replies":[]},{"poster":"TeCoolMage","date":"2015-10-31T02:23:25.652+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I once spent a lot of IP on runes and champions, equally\n\nThen I moved got to ranked and didn't want to buy the cheap champions.\n\nAnd I still don't have a proper AD rune page.\n\nQQ","replies":[]},{"poster":"GigaPube","date":"2015-10-31T01:49:28.445+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"your m8s a smart chap. what you can do is, you use the 2 most common rune pages that everyone recommends, 1 is AD quints and reds, armour yellows and MR blues. if you play with that rune page for a long time at least you'll learn to adjust your matchup in accordance with what you're running. your other page can be something else thats pretty safe, maybe an AP page but the 15 AP isnt thaaaat good, especially mid game so you can pick something else that seems of better value.\n\nits a lot better to play the free champs and try every single one that you have any interest in. since jinx is adc she'll be in free week rotation a lot more often so theres no need to waste 6300IP for her. its a lot better to buy cheaper champs just to have them. if you like adcs ashe is the cheapest and shes pretty strong right now. otherwise vayne is really good, everyone plays her. if you wanna buy a 6300IP champ you better be sure you'll play them religiously and appreciate them until you can buy others","replies":[]}]}
