Ashe&rsquo;s warcamp bristled with watchtowers and palisades, haggard soldiers leaning on their bows and spears on every  platform.\r\n\r\nThe track up the mountain to the east was little more than a path for goats and shepherds, but Ashe walked it with ease. Ahead, the track left the dense woods that coated the lower mountainside and she stepped onto a rocky outcrop, looking down upon her people. Deep in a glacial valley, her warcamp was a perfect circle, every tent evenly spaced around an enormous fire that served to ward off the bone-chilling cold. Next to the camp, like a mole on an otherwise perfect face, the scent of roasting meat rose from Tryndamere&rsquo;s barbarian horde.\r\n\r\nAshe surveyed her camp with a mix of pride and concern. Her marriage to the barbarian king was purely political, and in battle there were none equal to the barbarians. But this was an old worry. She was a queen, trained from childhood in politics, and she had been raised to expect a political marriage. This was not what troubled her now. The Frost Archer&rsquo;s eyes were marked by deep, dark circles. She had seen the same gaunt look on almost every soldier in her army. They were exhausted, almost as exhausted as she was. \r\n\r\nAshe looked away from her camp, further up the mountain, where a solitary plume of smoke rose from the woods. Her eyes hardened. It was time that this problem was resolved. Her people needed sleep. If Sejuani&rsquo;s screaming cavalry were to ride down the valley now, she knew her shieldwall would break, her archers would panic, and her fragile alliance would shatter. She was growing desperate.\r\n\r\nThe little fire crackled on the shoulder of the mountain. Two tents faced the cliff, deceptively small for the size of the people that they sheltered. Ashe sat by the fire. She had to approach this with tact and patience.\r\n\r\nThe bearskin flap of one tent pushed open and an enormous head poked out, blinking in the sun. Entirely bald, except for a thick, bushy moustache, Braum frowned at the queen.\r\n\r\n&ldquo;Hello, Braum.&rdquo;\r\n\r\nThe giant, bald head shook, clearing the sleep from his mind. His eyes lit upon the queen and a wide smile graced his face. \r\n\r\n&ldquo;Little queen. Get up, Gragas, my friend! We have a visitor!&rdquo; The Heart of the Freljord stood, tearing his tent up from every peg. The bearskin slumped to the ground as Braum stretched, then reached down and stood his door-shield up by his side.\r\n\r\nAshe blanched. Had he slept with the shield in his bed? Then she shook herself. That was not her business. As far as she was concerned, the big man could sleep with every door in Runeterra if he could solve her problem.\r\n\r\nThe other tent shook as Gragas pushed the flap open and rolled out. It seemed he took a little longer to shake off sleep. He looked blearily at Ashe, then at Braum. \r\n\r\n&ldquo;G&rsquo;morning, Ashe. G&rsquo;morning, Braum.&rdquo;\r\n\r\nBraum laughed. &ldquo;Ah, little Gragas, a little too much last night, yes?&rdquo; He looked conspiratorially at Ashe. &ldquo;Gragas has found a new ingredient for his brew, little queen.&rdquo; He leaned in closer, speaking in a whisper. &ldquo;He thinks I do not know what it is, but I do.&rdquo;\r\n\r\nAshe fought down the urge to yawn. Smalltalk was the most important part of diplomacy, she reminded herself. She forced a smile onto her face.\r\n\r\n&ldquo;What is it?&rdquo;\r\n\r\n&ldquo;The sap of a pine tree! Last night, he spent an hour licking the needles off of trees until he found the perfect one.&rdquo; Braum put his hands on his hips and his booming laugh rolled off the cliff. Ashe was sure she heard a groan echo from the camp at the bottom of the valley.\r\n\r\n&ldquo;Here, Gragas, we must offer the queen some drink! And breakfast, too, I think.&rdquo;\r\n\r\nThe Rabble Rouser frowned and used one meaty hand to lift his barrel up. A solitary purple drop fell from the open cask. \r\n\r\n&ldquo;No more. I will make some.&rdquo; \r\n\r\nAshe seized on the momentary lull in the conversation. &ldquo;Braum, I must speak with you. And you, Gragas.&rdquo; Ashe took a breath. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s important.&rdquo;\r\n\r\n &ldquo;Yes, little queen. It is a long way to walk just to see Braum and Gragas, no? But breakfast first.&rdquo;\r\n\r\nAshe sat through breakfast, and after-breakfast beer, and gritted her teeth through fifty stories as Braum and Gragas each did their best to out-boast the other. Finally, as Braum picked his teeth with a twig and Gragas lumbered off to find some more firewood, Ashe saw her chance.\r\n\r\n&ldquo;Braum. We need to talk.&rdquo; There was an edge to her voice, the voice of the Queen, that made Braum sit up and take notice.\r\n\r\n&ldquo;Have the scouts seen Sejuani&rsquo;s army?&rdquo;\r\n\r\nAshe frowned. &ldquo;No, Braum-&rdquo;\r\n\r\n&ldquo;Is it the ice ghosts in the forests? I do not like those rumours, little queen. They remind me of something, long ago- the Frostguard-&rdquo;\r\n\r\nAshe&rsquo;s composure snapped. &ldquo;Braum, no! Nothing like that. It&rsquo;s you, and Gragas, Braum.&rdquo;\r\n\r\n&ldquo;I do not follow.&rdquo;\r\n\r\nAshe realized there was no more avoiding the issue. &ldquo;The snoring, Braum. We can&rsquo;t take any more. No-one has slept in a week-&rdquo;\r\n\r\nThe fired crackled as a log collapsed into ash. A long moment passed.\r\n\r\nBraum frowned. &ldquo;Snoring? But- ah.&rdquo;\r\n\r\nAshe felt a tide of relief sweep over her. &ldquo;So you understand? We have ways to prevent it- there&rsquo;s a doctor from Demacia with us, he says he knows of a cure.&rdquo;\r\n\r\nBraum nodded. &ldquo;Yes, yes. I have heard the snoring as well. I did not think much of it, but I am a good sleeper. He is very loud, is he not?&rdquo;\r\n\r\nAshe frowned. She had heard Braum refer to himself as Braum, but never-\r\n\r\nBraum broke into her thoughts. &ldquo;It is good you told me. Gragas would rather hear the news from a friend, I think. I shall tell him gently.&rdquo;\r\n\r\nAshe let out a breath. Unbelievable.\r\n\r\nGragas returned from the woods, a massive bundle of wood under his arm. Braum turned to him.\r\n\r\n&ldquo;Gragas, my friend. We have something to discuss.&rdquo;\r\n\r\nAshe realized she had no hope here. Then an idea sprang into her mind. &ldquo;I need diplomatic envoys to Piltover and Demacia. Tryndamere had the idea of sending the two of you.&rdquo;\r\n\r\nGragas frowned. &ldquo;You want us to be ambassadors?&rdquo;\r\n\r\nBraum looked at Ashe, confused. Then realisation dawned on his face. Obviously she could not bear to hurt Gragas&rsquo; feelings. He looked kindly at the little queen. She was a fine ruler, he thought.\r\n\r\n&ldquo;Yes, Gragas. We shall go together. Were you not speaking to me of the new breweries in Piltover? It will be a fine journey.&rdquo;\r\n\r\nThe frown lifted from Gragas&rsquo; face. &ldquo;I will be proud to serve you, Lady Ashe.&rdquo; He bowed as low as his massive girth would allow.\r\n\r\nAshe returned the bow, with as much dignity as she could master. &ldquo;You will leave this afternoon. Now I must leave you- leaving ambassadors must have a parade, and a letter of recommendation-&rdquo;\r\n\r\nGragas held up a hand. &ldquo;Say no more.&rdquo;\r\n\r\nAshe thought on what she had done as she walked the track back down to her camp. She had just sent two of her finest warriors away. And she may have irreparably damaged the relations her tribe had with Piltover and Demacia. But all those reasons faded as she contemplated the idea of a night of actual sleep.\r\n\r\nThe sky was a swirl of orange and pink and blue as the sun set over the Freljord. Ashe&rsquo;s perfect camp was silent. Empty watchtowers and palisades bristled around the perimeter. Tomorrow, sentries would return to their places, the watch restored. But not tonight.","replies":[{"poster":"HierosGodhead","date":"2016-06-26T03:52:45.808+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"One of the few that actually made me giggle, good luck!","replies":[]},{"poster":"itsaneeps","date":"2016-07-28T04:50:04.056+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"That.
