Done a troubleshoot with my ISP. I am on fibre, with a wired connection, a 5ghz wifi, a standard wifi. I&#039;ve re-installed the game. I&#039;ve disabled firewalls, running as administrator and I am STILL getting League of Legends (TM), Client not responding error. Now the annoying thing is, I&#039;m not getting it every game. I&#039;m not getting it every second game. It happens and I fix it, then it happens two games later. All of my drivers are up to date. I&#039;ve waited through 5-minute leave busters, 15-minute leave busters and 20-minute leave busters. I no longer have anti-virus on my computer because every time I patch the client it stops working. (Which by the way, if every single other program in the WORLD runs fine and League does not, it isn&#039;t everyone else&#039;s computer that is the problem). What do I do? I have done every single troubleshooting. I&#039;ve monitored my network traffic and not for one second do I have a network dropoff. I have no idea why this keeps happening, and I am sick of waiting for leave buster.","replies":[{"poster":"VENI VIDI VICI","date":"2018-02-28T09:10:39.020+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Same thing happens with me on Overwatch.
