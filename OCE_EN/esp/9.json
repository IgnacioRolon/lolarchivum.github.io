Someone stole my role and yeah I didn&#039;t have the patience to deal with it, its 3 am and I&#039;m tired, I wasn&#039;t in the best mood. Not saying I don&#039;t deserve it, but first offence to this category is rather bullshit. Does this mean my next punishment is perm? lol. Fuck league dude.\n\nIt&#039;s good to see they finally did something about inters they still need to fucking fix the other aspects of penalties such as chat that isn't even toxic that people are getting punished for.","replies":[{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2018-02-09T03:58:46.520+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":2,"body":"First offence for intentionally feeding is always 14 day ban anyway. A chat restriction wouldn't make much sense for a gameplay offence. So yes, your next punishment will be a permanent suspension.","replies":[]}]}
