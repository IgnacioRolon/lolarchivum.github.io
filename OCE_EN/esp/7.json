You guys should have acted quicker for this. I have seen you guys act quicker and give loss prevention to most losses and the people who arent affected are the ones that benefit from it and not the others who are.  Surely there should be something to compensate for the loss. \n\nYou can't even give me 2 loss prevention games? REALLY? That's fucked.

This issue seems to be intermittently affecting a small number of players - with the symptoms described in the OP.  While the site is unclear, optus do seem to be reporting a number of ongoing voice/data issues on their [network status](https://www.optus.com.au/about/network/service-status) page today.\n\nThe network engineering team at Riot have attempted re-routing traffic from LoL to Optus out through a different ISP in an attempt to mitigate the issues, however this appears to have had little impact.\n\nAt this stage, if you are affected by the issue you will likely need to wait until Optus are able to resolve their ongoing data and network issues.   In that case I'd suggest steering clear of ranked until you are sure you can reliably connect to games.\n\nCheers\nMindstar\n\nPS: An alternative option **MAY ** be to connect to LoL via a VPN service, which could get  your traffic out of Optus via a slightly different path.  If anyone has success in testing this, please update here as I'm sure other players would like to know.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"wish the great","date":"2018-05-04T21:40:49.910+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"including me i live in VIC and i have optus my internet  used to be stable mostly at 30 to 40 ping  at night only due to internet traffic during the night   but recently my ping is normal (during the day) when no one is their at home. but when everyone(during the night) the ping is 60 and goes up to 300  ms and fluctuates constantly and i play and main Cassiopeia and having good internet is something important when playing this champ.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2018-05-04T01:45:36.994+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"1.
