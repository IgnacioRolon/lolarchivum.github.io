It may get removed again.\n\nAnyway, you can get banned for inting now and its instant 2 week ban it seems. literally my first offence for inting. It was a casual and becasue I can&#039;t leave the game without receiving a punishment, I feel forced to be in it, I decided to troll the same motherfucker that instant locked mid. \nI guess I deserved it.. my next punishment will be perm ban I guess? Fucking hell riot.\n\nIt was obvious inting like 1 death per minute. Level 3 at 13 minutes. It was 3 am and some %%%% decided to be a %%%%. It&#039;s not like I can talk to him in chat and get it off my chest by venting. this was the next best thing as I thought it wouldn&#039;t be bannable. It&#039;s good to see it&#039;s working though because some people do this in ranked.\n\nPic is riot support explaining how the report system works that I asked for about a **month ago**. Atleast give some warning on your patch notes about the report system being updated/improved..

You realise he's telling you that if you're reported for inting when you've just had a bad game it won't affect you, presumably in response to something you asked right? If you're reported for inting and are inting, if course it's going to affect your account lol.","replies":[]},{"poster":"SOOM","date":"2018-02-09T00:23:42.868+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Did you know that the bird is the word","replies":[{"poster":"esp","date":"2018-02-09T00:25:00.946+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=MysticLlamaZ,realm=OCE,application-id=T8eq2lFQ,discussion-id=GnFHFivl,comment-id=0001,timestamp=2018-02-09T00:23:42.868+0000)\n>\n> Did you know that the bird is the word\n\nThanks peter lol","replies":[]}]}]}
