If they are toxic, and you report them, then they will have their behaviour reviewed same as you, and will be considered for punishment same as you. If someone told you to kill yourself, they're likely facing an instant 14 day ban (one step from perma) where you only got a chat restriction for whatever you said. In other words you are held accountable for your actions, and they will be held accountable for theirs.\n\n\"Sensitive words\" are only one means of being negative, and you can use most of those words in a completely casual manner. You could be ragging on your team the entire game and not use a single swear, but it's still negative behaviour.

If you are struggling to reign in your negativity, then it's best to simply mute and move on, unbind chat if you have to, because fanning the flames doesn't help anyone, it does the exact opposite, and even if being a positive member of the community doesn't mean jack to you, if nothing else it puts you one step closer to losing your account.\n\nA lot of people seem to be assuming the lines quoted were what the agent was presenting as evidence, but I'm pretty dang sure he was only giving an example of how not constructive you were being, not saying \"this is what got you punished\".\n\nObviously we here on boards don't have the luxury of quoting things that would have contributed to your punishment since we can't see your logs, which I why I recommend posting them if you want advice.

I'd rather entertain myself talking to this fuckwit who has so much to say about me when they don't know me but can only base their comments on my k/d. I'm still failing to understand, especially on that second game. If you imagine an xp bar, but instead a punishment xp bar and when it reaches its max, you get punished. I wouldn't care if it added points to that, But to actually get penalised for it, That's what I'm not happy about. The first game, I only agree I am guilty of telling shen to do something because he just basically didn't do anything to help me, who wouldn't get frustrated about that.

This Rioter claims he has gone through this guys account and the best he can come up for an example for his ban is blahahahah? honestly if that's the case god knows what happens when you get a 10 game chat ban? Do you say good job with a smiley face and get one of those? and yes i'm aware the argument is that he isn't using chat very constructively which is fair enough its a bit of spam. great.....  you also say its entirely possible that it wasn't just this game but a few bad games leading up to this that caused the chat ban. Riot usually tell you if that's the case or not. \n\n I personally believe if riot thinks that someone is not using chat in game correctly, that they should warn them in game that their chat isn't being constructive, a warning in lobby to remember to be constructive in chat or face a ban, or to simply time them out for 3-5 mins at a time in game when the chat isn't being particularly useful.  yes of course ban someone when they are straight up being toxic with swear words and constant abuse in chat but the logs he posted he just seemed frustrated with his team mates, clearly he wanted to win.  I recently read riot took away warnings due to community feedback and now instead op for straight up bans.. This is a silly mistake. Most people who get a warning would probably get shit scared and stop.. People spend hundreds of hours if not thousands and definitely thousands of dollars on their accounts  and a warning to a person who may of just slipped up one game seems reasonable to me. I'm all for cleaning up the community in regards to toxic players but it seems to be you literally cant say anything unless it is G rated or you may face a ban, if this is the case why do we have to option to have no filter on our chats...\n\nI personally think league players don't give a shit about chat unless its particularly disgusting, (such as constant spam swearing, racism, sexism, and inting.  if people are having a heated discussion in game without it being just a complete flame fest and no one is actually talking about the game just comments like \"you're fucking bad\" \"l2p\" \"lmao this guy is terrible\" in all chat etc.  Those are the kind of things that deserve a chat ban maybe even a 14 day ban with it continuing it should be a perm.  Yes the things he typed were not ideal but to be one step away from a 14 day ban is just dumb.  I mean there are some things in the chat that should be good for example \"could have helped you but i'm lagging, sorry bro\" and report Jax for suicide.  in none of these chats is he just going off on someone. \n\n\nSo yeah, i honestly think for cases like these warnings should be issued, and if a warning happens and they do something like this again, yeah ban the fuck out of them.

Most people who get a warning would probably get shit scared and stop.. People spend hundreds of hours if not thousands and definitely thousands of dollars on their accounts  and a warning to a person who may of just slipped up one game seems reasonable to me. I&#x27;m all for cleaning up the community in regards to toxic players but it seems to be you literally cant say anything unless it is G rated or you may face a ban, if this is the case why do we have to option to have no filter on our chats...\n> \n> I personally think league players don&#x27;t give a shit about chat unless its particularly disgusting, (such as constant spam swearing, racism, sexism, and inting.  if people are having a heated discussion in game without it being just a complete flame fest and no one is actually talking about the game just comments like &quot;you&#x27;re fucking bad&quot; &quot;l2p&quot; &quot;lmao this guy is terrible&quot; in all chat etc.  Those are the kind of things that deserve a chat ban maybe even a 14 day ban with it continuing it should be a perm.  Yes the things he typed were not ideal but to be one step away from a 14 day ban is just dumb.  I mean there are some things in the chat that should be good for example &quot;could have helped you but i&#x27;m lagging, sorry bro&quot; and report Jax for suicide.  in none of these chats is he just going off on someone. \n> \n> \n> So yeah, i honestly think for cases like these warnings should be issued, and if a warning happens and they do something like this again, yeah ban the fuck out of them.  But i feel like riot should just get rid of chat and use pings if this is the threshhold for bans. :)\n\nSee, this I can agree with. The punishments being dished out for such minor problems is bullshit.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"esp","date":"2018-01-04T06:16:03.605+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Seras Dragon,realm=OCE,application-id=T8eq2lFQ,discussion-id=rXbpiI4g,comment-id=0005,timestamp=2018-01-04T05:40:51.074+0000)\n>\n> While that&#x27;s a very vague answer, I would recommend posting your chat logs if you are unsure what may have gotten you punished.\n> \n> To give you a proper answer where support did not (assuming nothing was edited), someone else being toxic/negative does not give you a right to be, and there is still 3 other players on your team that have to sit there and hear it. If they are toxic, and you report them, then they will have their behaviour reviewed same as you, and will be considered for punishment same as you. If someone told you to kill yourself, they&#x27;re likely facing an instant 14 day ban (one step from perma) where you only got a chat restriction for whatever you said. In other words you are held accountable for your actions, and they will be held accountable for theirs.\n> \n> &quot;Sensitive words&quot; are only one means of being negative, and you can use most of those words in a completely casual manner. You could be ragging on your team the entire game and not use a single swear, but it&#x27;s still negative behaviour. This is largely why I recommend posting your chat logs because there seems to be a common misconception that if you aren&#x27;t swearing you aren&#x27;t being negative.\n> \n> To clarify some of what the support agent was trying to say (badly), you don&#x27;t have to be a shining beacon of positivity, but you will be held responsible for negative behaviours, regardless of who started it. If you are struggling to reign in your negativity, then it&#x27;s best to simply mute and move on, unbind chat if you have to, because fanning the flames doesn&#x27;t help anyone, it does the exact opposite, and even if being a positive member of the community doesn&#x27;t mean jack to you, if nothing else it puts you one step closer to losing your account.\n> \n> A lot of people seem to be assuming the lines quoted were what the agent was presenting as evidence, but I&#x27;m pretty dang sure he was only giving an example of how not constructive you were being, not saying &quot;this is what got you punished&quot;.\n> \n> Obviously we here on boards don&#x27;t have the luxury of quoting things that would have contributed to your punishment since we can&#x27;t see your logs, which I why I recommend posting them if you want advice. If the ban was unwarranted then you have community support and fuel to appeal it, and if it was then we can supply you with a much clearer reason why, bearing in mind of course that we cannot see any in game factors that may have contributed.\n\nAppreciate the long response but, no..  I don't agree with you. I will post the logs that appear when I log into the game for you and everyone else, You can tell me if it was deserved or not. I do like to type a lot when someone is being aggressive towards me and be a smartass. I don't think that should be a punishable offense though.","replies":[{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2018-01-04T06:26:04.880+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"Defending yourself and being toxic back in kind are not the same.

First game pretty much the first words you say, second took you some time to get going. For a chat restriction (a pretty minor punishment) these logs are plenty, but I'm happy to highlight some things for you.\n\n>Ethvn: do something\nEthvn: %%%%\nEthvn: youre a fucking pussy shen\nEthvn: you saw trist had no jump\nEthvn: you seen lulu had no ult\nEthvn: kill me because its shen faulyt\n\nYou've already targeted one player with abuse, and for what? Cause he messed up a gank/roam/tp? So freaking what. Not everyone plays perfectly all the time, nevermind the fact that you don't appear to play ranked so this was more than likely a normal, where people to go to have fun or to practice, not to play to the best of their ability to please other people.\n\n>Ethvn: You are a scared little pussy\nEthvn: Vayne be quiet.\n\nNot only are you continuing meaningless abuse for something probably happened quite a while ago instead of just getting on with the game you're being an ass to another player that probably just wanted you to stop talking shit and just play the game.\n\n>Ethvn: again, you havent done anything for me\n\nNot everything is about you. Even a support cannot always give the world to their ADC if the enemy team is just better and they're being zoned out. If they can't do anything for you what would you prefer? They *maybe* get you a kill and die? What advantage does that give you? What purpose does it serve? Sometimes, you can't do something when you want to, and you can't win every game, so it's a pretty asinine and arrogant thing to say.\n\n>Ethvn: Irellevant information I didn't ask for\nEthvn: Lol\nEthvn: ASk me where im from\nEthvn: Vayne stop trying to make friends with enemies bro\nEthvn: blahblahblahblahblahblahblahblahblahblahblahblahblahblahblahblah\nEthvn: blahblahblahblahblahblahblahblahblahblahblahblahblahblahblahblah\nEthvn: blahblahblahblahblahblahblahblahblahblahblahblahblahblahblahblahblahblahblahblahblahblah\n\nInfo is irrelevant because you didn't ask for it? Again not everything is about you, and are you trying to race bait them or something? Telling them to ask you where you're from? Sounds like you're really trying to start shit there. You obviously know you are being negative and what to drag them into it too and for what? So they'll get punished? And the blah blah, do you even realise how utterly pointless that is? The only purpose that could serve is to belittle in the most childish way possible. I fail to see how you believe this log isn't all that negative.\n\n>Ethvn: You havent told me what a gank is\nEthvn: please tell me what a gank is\nEthvn: Reported\nEthvn: I am going to x2 you\nEthvn: I can\nEthvn: because I have a friend in the game\n\nAgain, baiting negativity from your team. Trying so hard to frustrate and tilt them does not in any way constitute \"continuing to play and proceeding to win without negativity\". Then you straight up threaten your team. Nevermind the fact that number of reports don't matter, especially when premades are involved, only valid reports.\n\n>Ethvn: In riots eyes, anything negative is verbal abuse\n\nThat doesn't even really make sense, but I guess you're trying to say that Riot recognises your words as negative verbal abuse. If you were aware that what you were doing was wrong in the eyes of the community and the company that holds power over your account, why are you so surprised to be punished? Whether you agree with the state of things or not, you are obviously aware that your behaviour would be considered negative and worthy of punishment, so why now do you say you do not deserve it?\n\nEthvn: Not possible\nEthvn: I'm level 5 honor\n\n>If you're going to demonstrate negative behaviour then honour doesn't mean *anything*. Why do you think the only way to lose honour is to be punished? It does not matter what level honour you were, keeping your mouth shut one game and being honoured, does not discount the fact that you were a toxic ass for the entirety of that first game and much of the second. You are being held accountable for those actions, past honourable behaviour does not change them.\n\nE>thvn: You're not calling me an idiot anymore, why not\nEthvn: Scared?\n\nAgain you're just fuelling the fire. You know you're being negative and you want them to respond in kind.\n\n___\n\n>Ethvn: really, what can I do to get out if flash is on cd?\nEthvn: Got an answer??\nEthvn: Didn't think so.\n\n>Ethvn: yup, so gg probably\nEthvn: I hope you guys can win\n\n>Ethvn: Lol. You guys left me again\nEthvn: You don't deserve to win, gg\n\n>Ethvn: The report system is chat sensitive and I haven't said anything to alert it.\n\nPretty much the same as in the first game so I won't repeat myself anymore. While the second game was obviously more mild and far less volume, I imagine it was the valid report that pushed you over the edge, especially with such a recent punishment in your history.\n\nThe support response may have left much to be desired, but I imagine they were of the mind that you knew exactly what you had done from looking at your logs, and knew you were just submitting a ticket to complain because you can. You deserved the chat restriction, and if you continue with this kind of behaviour you're only going to continue through the punishment tiers.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Yasei Doubutsu","date":"2018-01-04T04:35:44.758+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"wtf riot?","replies":[]},{"poster":"esp","date":"2018-01-04T08:52:43.272+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Lol..................................................................","replies":[]},{"poster":"Yasei Doubutsu","date":"2018-01-04T04:36:21.752+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":2,"body":"Man no wonder riots can't do shit about bots in our games, there own bots are also fuckin stupid.","replies":[]},{"poster":"esp","date":"2018-01-04T06:33:17.120+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"Also, looking at the summoner code, I don't see anything that goes against it.","replies":[]}]}
