I think flaming once during a single game should be over looked. If it was constant abuse, I would be able to face the music and say \"ok, they have a point.\" I really only abused my right to use the in-game chat in a \"non constructive way\" as my support ticket responder had said. There are worse things than arguing pettily with someone just as immature as you. \nI understand what you mean, believe me I do. I just want to get my point across to you.\n\nThe issue I want addressed is this.** Severity isn't determined where penalties are applied**. For e.g, One of my friends was 2 week suspended for having banter with me using the in-game chat feature and he submit a ticket and the riot agent said while it may have been your friend others didn't take lightly to it. Its not exact words but that was pretty much what he meant. Getting punished for it is dumb. Like cmon.. next penalty is perm suspension.. I can't believe you can agree with this penalty system. Gehrin said it's okay when it's banter but who's to tell it is banter because while I'm pretty sure it's a bot that deals with reports, It can't tell what is and what isn't. Submitting a ticket doesn't do much and the support only reply like twice before they close the ticket and stop dealing with you when you are being legit about your questions. It's just seems like copy past replies and will find anything that can be taken out of context to justify the punishment.","replies":[{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2018-01-06T01:34:59.044+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":1,"body":">I think flaming once during a single game should be over looked.

Serious offences will escalate you tiers. Your log is definitely gross, but like you say you weren't being racist or anything so you were escalated normally through the four tiers (10 game chat, 25 game chat, 14 day ban, perma ban). You got a 10 game chat restriction, showed that it didn't prompt you to be more aware and careful of your behaviour at all, and so continued through the tiers.\n\nI don't know the context of your friend's punishment, so I'm not going to comment on it. I don't want any speculation to be taken out of context. You have to remember though that while you and your friend may be 'bantering', and you seem to have a very loose definition of that if you consider your log to be banter, there are still 3 other people on your team, and 8 in the game that have to listen to you. If you're creating a negative experience for them then that's no bueno.\n\n>but who's to tell it is banter\n\nThe players in your game do. The community ultimately decides what is or isn't ok by what they choose to report. If you r team agreed that it was banter, then the game wouldn't have even been looked at. On that note I'd also like to mention that Gehirn said \"You've simply been racking up reports for weeks\" which means you get reported *a lot*.\n\n>Submitting a ticket doesn't do much\n\nIf the punishment was deserved, then no. If you had to spend a night in jail for theft, do you think they'd let you out just because \"I didn't steal much and I'm asking you nicely\"? Support isn't going to revoke a valid punishment.","replies":[{"poster":"JasonWazza","date":"2018-01-06T02:11:27.731+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":">The players in your game do.

It's not really up to them what culture they have, the second it comes into the spotlight the AFL reacts because they all answer to the AFL ultimately, please quote me where i said abuse is justified... Im simply saying professionals are held to a lot higher standard than the average dude playing for a local team, probably because it looks bad and they get paid a shit load of money. and you just said if you know that's not accepted in the community you're in.. I'm pretty sure this dude is arguing that what he said is accepted? or atleast not worthy of his punishment..  I mean Look at tyler1 for example, he was likely the most toxic player in the entire game and it took 3 months for riot to actually perma ban him, They probably didn't want to give up how much attention he brought to the game even though he  should of been permmed 2 months prior. They only really did anything when the backlash was so strong they were forced to. \n\n\nAlso as of today after 619 days he is actually not banned anymore.

Had a guy threaten to smash my face in but when I called him a dickhead and got in his face about it he backed off. Shook hands after the game, played him again in round 9. No more threats to smash my face in (although he did threaten to stab my team mate in a different game). Thing is, it was a game, people got heated, said some things and carried on with the game, shake hands after (except that one time he was a dick about it to another team mate - to be fair that dude on the opposition was a colossal D-hole), \nbut honestly it was no big deal.\n\nBut I certainly didnt go report him to the ref for saying bad words, and the ref didnt get all up in his beef about it.\n\nBut I can tell you right now if the same guy started kicking own goals or letting the opposition through, he would not be welcomed back.\n\nIf you play basket ball you know that sometimes things get heated, team mates get frustrated, and fights almost kick off. But it is part of the game and not something to get kicked off the team for if it is all in the spirit of the game.\n\nThats the problem right now - bad words are the worst possible thing you can do in lol yet behaviour which actually wrecks games but requires manual as opposed to automated reviews does not get punished nearly as frequently.\n\nsticks and stones.","replies":[{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2018-01-05T10:00:23.450+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":2,"body":"I played field hockey for 10 years and if someone threatened to smash someone's face in they'd be out faster than they could blink.

Gehrin can say I've been getting reports for weeks but there's no chat logs of why. I actually put in a ticket to see this because I am really quite curious to see what i've done wrong in OTHER games. It would be a learning experience for me. As for the second and probably even the past penalty I could *possibly* disagree on. First penatly was 5 game chat ban, pretty minor, i ignored it was like whatever. Then I got 25 chat restricted and i realised the severity that the next penalty is 2 week ban. It's fucking dumb dude.\n\nI've seen a lot worse chats in games and I'm thinking of making a collage of screen shots to put in these boards just to try and get riot to tone it down on the penalties they're dishing out. Whatever you're saying is reportable that I did in my chat logs I see in about 90% of my games. \n\nIf I saw people saying the same things I said, before I got penalised, I wouldn't expect people to get penalties for it.
