They also made it super obvious that they were removing IP boosts because XP is the only way to gain blue essence, through levelling up.\n\nHonestly every issue you have that you listed in your post is entirely borne of your own misunderstandings. Also small wonder you have no Blue Essence income if you aren't really playing. That, and the fact that you would barely be earning IP under the old system anyway through lack of participation.","replies":[{"poster":"catch this work","date":"2017-12-20T08:54:08.571+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"No. I'm level 50 right now and I've only got 6000 blue essence all up from playing 100+ games.
