Riot support is taking a while and they have been using my credit card to purchase rp. Is there any faster way to recover my account?","replies":[{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2018-01-26T13:14:29.353+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Call your credit card company and tell them to stop any transactions from that vendor (Riot). Just tell them the account has been compromised and you aren't making those transactions, they should also be able to charge back all of that. Then go through account recovery as normal. Tell support about the charge backs as well, otherwise your account will get banned for that.","replies":[{"poster":"Lucysan","date":"2018-01-27T01:38:08.636+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Im in the process of that, im just curious about how i didnt get any emails about my password or email changing.","replies":[{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2018-01-27T01:52:07.450+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"League doesn't have two factor authentication and it still isn't compulsory to verify the email attached to your account [though they're pushing it real hard as of today](https://boards.oce.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/announcements/3E8WROON-in-client-email-verification-kicking-off-in-oce).\n\n2FA has always kind of been a SoonTM project and personally I hope it really is very soon simply because many people don't take proper steps to secure their accounts themselves.\n\nIn the meantime the best you can do is verify your email, change your password reasonably often making it something a *computer* can't guess easily (doesn't have to be random, the longer the better) and probably not attach your card details to your account and/or use paypal instead so you only have to type in a password every time instead of your whole card details.","replies":[{"poster":"Lucysan","date":"2018-01-27T09:55:14.539+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Wasnt able to restore my account back because my friend gave me the account back in 2014 and account sharing isnt allowed. feels bad spent like 1k on this game.

You could probably recover it if you got your friend to help you with the recovery process, but I wouldn't count on anything.","replies":[{"poster":"Lucysan","date":"2018-01-27T12:56:24.450+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Contacting my friend asap to try recover the account.
