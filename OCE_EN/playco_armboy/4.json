However when I press it, all that happens is that the side of my battlefield changes (my character would move from bottom left to top right and so would my champions etc) and that's it. Even when I have lost and am spectating it does the exact same thing. When I click on the portraits as I've been told multiple times it does the exact same thing.\n\n(I have pictures to add but I have no idea how to upload them here) ","replies":[]}
