I can&#039;t figure if this comes from the snowballs or the patched champions but it does feel like a chaotic mess now. A shame as I always enjoyed a quick game in this mode before (also found it was a fun way to figure out champs) but I fear I won&#039;t play it again in that state.\r\nAnyone else feels that way ?","replies":[{"poster":"kJs","date":"2015-06-12T07:33:35.385+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yeah. It was a cool place to play new champions because you wouldn't get jumped on every minute. I will probably be playing a lot less of it  now.","replies":[]},{"poster":"DiamondAries","date":"2015-06-12T04:57:29.718+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"ARAM was always a chaotic mess. Sometimes you just get really sloppy team comps, and then there are champions that have powerful zone and can pretty much halt any progression, like Heimer and his turrets or even Xerath. The snowballs reduced that mess by offering even the worse team comps some way to hard engage.","replies":[]}]}
