I will lose the first game of  three and  five games respectively of my promo series and it will say in the defeat screen that i have lost the first game of my series, but then when i leave the summary page and go into my summoner profile and it has put me down to 82 LP but when i look at the league tab it says i have one loss.  When i play my next game however it treats me as if I am no longer in promotion i gain and lose LP. It is getting frustrating is this a known bug?","replies":[{"poster":"HORSE OF FORCE","date":"2015-05-18T10:25:58.902+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"May or may not be related to the servers pooping themselves. I suggest you create a [support ticket](https://support.leagueoflegends.com/anonymous_requests/new) (honestly, though, it most likely will get you nothing) to at least let them know that this is happening.\n\nAlso, sometimes, the server that addresses whether games are won/loss and whether they appear on your profile is a bit sluggish, so immediately viewing your profile and then having a game could confuse it. Try putting in a real-time delay between your games.\n\nBest of luck.","replies":[]}]}
