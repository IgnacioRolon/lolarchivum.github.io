So, I **decayed** to Plat I.\r\nHowever, now I&#039;m really into it again, and am planning to become high Diamond/Master next season by playing support.\r\n\r\n**Supports I have mastered:**\r\n{{champion:201}} \r\n\r\n**Supports I&#039;m decent at:**\r\n{{champion:223}} {{champion:12}} \r\n\r\n**Supports I&#039;m planning to play and improve on:**\r\n{{champion:44}} {{champion:497}} {{champion:412}} {{champion:53}} \r\n\r\nI will be trying hard next season. I can play Riven very well, so I will be putting **TOP as my secondary role**.\r\nI usually play between 6AM-11AM &amp; 7PM-12PM.\r\n\r\nI do believe I can improve as a support massively. I believe that if I can get to diamond just _auto-piloting_ and playing only two champions, if I expanded my champion pool and tried harder, I could get into even a higher league.\r\n\r\n**My Goal:**\r\n\r\n- Get into at least a semi-pro team.\r\n- Become challenger.\r\n- Be a content maker.","replies":[]}
