This is my shot at a speedster!  If you have the time, please give Sallora a read and let me know what you think! I'd appreciate it, thanks guys! :D <3\nEDIT: I recently completely reworked Sallora so if you could let me know what you think now, that'd be awesome!\n{{sticker:slayer-pantheon-thumbs}} \n\n*******************************************************************************\n\n_**Contents**_\n\n_Intro_\n_*Contents_\n_Summary/Role_\n_Short Lore_\n_Information_\n_Statistics_\n_Abilities (Short Descriptions)_\n_Abilities (Full Descriptions)_\n_Gameplay_\n_Quotes_\n_Lore/Full Origin Story_\n_Other Champions_\n_History_\n_Outro_\n\n>_*Note: \"Gameplay\" is not yet added but will have \"Early Game\", \"Mid Game\", \"Late Game\", \"Skill Order, Builds, Runes, and Masteries\", and \"Tips and Tricks\"._\n\n*******************************************************************************\n\n_**Summary/Role**_\n\nRoles: Slayer (Primary), Fighter (Secondary)\n\nSummary: In League of Legends, Sallora is an ad assassin fit most comfortable in mid lane. A skilled Sallora no trouble getting to her target in a fight or a duel due to her long distance initiations granted by her insane amount of dashes and mobility. In a one-on-one, Sallora's damage mainly comes from passing through the enemy by some means, and so proper positioning and dodging the right skills is key to continue her stream of damage. In teamfights, a good Sallora chooses a target in her head and activates her ulti to give her huge chase potential, before positioning herself around her target at the right angles to deal the maximum damage possible in just a split second. Running away from Sallora is pretty difficult, unless you're teleporting around, because a passive component allows her to match the speed of anyone she is hunting down! If Sallora manages to kill her target, without proper focus from the enemy team, she's quite slippery and can do the running away herself pretty well also. Dodging the right skills, picking the right target, and having quick reflexes are all key when playing Sallora effectively.\n\n*******************************************************************************\n\n_**Short Lore** (This is the short in-client lore. If you like lore, read the full lore after her quotes!)_\n\nSallora is a girl who runs at the fastest speeds possible to whip around fighting crime in Zaun. Using devices blueprinted by her father, she looks at the different ways speed can be used to overcome an opponent. She enjoys a good race when she isn't battling Zaun thugs, and occasionally, she associates herself with the \"Lost Children of Zaun\". For the most part though, she has one goal and one goal alone; to avenge her real mother, Ivy.\n\n*******************************************************************************\n\n_**Information**_\n\nName: _Sallora Pryenkhast_\nLoL Title: _Sallora, the Speedfreak's Daughter_\nGender: _Female_\nAllegiance: _Zaun_\nFriends: _Ekko, Zac, Jinx_\nRivals: _Viktor, Jayce, Caitlyn, Vi_\n\nFun Fact: Ekko helped Sallora create most of her devices, and in return, Sallora helps Ekko fight the Zaun thugs when he needs her. (Sorry, I love Ekko too much! :3)\n\n>_*Note: (I changed her title because the old one didn't seem to fit her lore as well as this one. Lemme know if you don't like the change though! :3)_\n\n*******************************************************************************\n\n_**Statistics**_\n\nHealth: \t\t\t\t493 + 81\nHP5:\t\t\t\t6.55 + 0.65\nMana: \t\t\t\t346 + 34\nMP5:\t\t\t\t6.71 + 0.7\nAttack Damage: \t\t54.6 + 3.4\nAttack Speed: \t\t\t0.625 + 2.5%\nArmour:\t\t\t23.38 + 3.5\nMagic Resist: \t\t\t30.85 + 1.25\nMove Speed: \t\t\t355\nRange: \t\t\t\t125\n\n>_*Note: The format is \"Base Stat (At level 0) + Growth stat\". Add them for level 1 stats. Isn't applicable for attack speed which is at 0.625 at level 1, then adding 2.5% thereafter._\n\n*******************************************************************************\n\n_**Abilities (Short Descriptions)**_\n\n>_*Note: There's short descriptions (for those who tl:dr) and full descriptions of the abilities (for those who like numbers). You don't need to read both of them if you don't want to :)_\n\n_**Passive: Fastest Girl Alive**_\n\n**Quick Reflexes**\nSallora has a brief moment to dodge an enemy ability when it comes her way by clicking herself. Attacking enemies reduces the cooldown of this ability.\n\n**Can't Outrun Me!**\nSallora matches her most recently damaged target's movement speed if they are faster than her while moving towards them. She loses this bonus when she takes damage from a dodgeable ability or any form of CC.\n\n_**Q: In the Blink of an Eye**_\nSallora dashes in a skill shot dealing physical damage to the first enemy champion hit. If she hits an enemy champion, she gains a burst of decaying movement speed. Can be re-cast once.\n\n_**W: Winding Vortex**_\nSallora deals damage to nearby enemy champions, slowing them greatly for a split second, and causing them to take additional damage from Sallora's next ability.\n\n_**E: Rapid Combat**_\nSallora dashes to her target dealing physical damage, and then behind them dealing the same damage again.\n\n_**R: Lightspeed**_\nFor a short period of time, Sallora moves insanely fast, and can cast \"In the Blink of an Eye\" infinitely at no mana cost until she is in combat. She can re-activate the ability to deal missing health damage to her target. Colliding with a wall ends the whole effect.\n\n*******************************************************************************\n\n_**Abilities (Full Descriptions)**_\n\n_**Passive: Fastest Girl Alive**_\n\n**Quick Reflexes**\nSallora's goggles allows her to see incoming spells just a split second before they hit her. She has 0.5 seconds to left-click herself and dodge an ability when she is about to be hit. This has a 14 second cooldown. Hitting an enemy champion with a spell reduces the cooldown by one second. \n\n>_*Note: You cannot dodge basic attacks, or point-and-click instant casts by dodging, but you can dodge any other ability. E.g Cannot dodge a Malzahar E, or Skarner ult, but you can dodge something like a Syndra ult or Warwick ult. You also don't need to dodge an ability. The dodge only goes on cooldown if you decide to dodge._\n\n**Can't Outrun Me!**\nWhen Sallora attacks an enemy champion, she sneaks a device onto her target that takes note of their movement speed if it is higher than hers and returns to her after a second to replicate the speed while moving towards them until the champion dies or is out of range. She loses the movement speed when she takes damage from a dodgeable ability, or any crowd control, and can regain the passive after 4 seconds when she deals damage again. This movement speed doesn't apply to any of the speed ratios on her kit.\n\n_Range: 1500_\n\n>_*Note: Literally any crowd control; slows, silences, and fears all count. The reason for not having the passive speed apply to damage is to make it so it's not the faster her opponent is that matters too much, only how fast Sallora is herself. This isn't a means of \"I'll one shot you for being faster than me\", it's a means of chasing and that's it_\n\n_**Q: In the Blink of an Eye**_\nSallora dashes in a skill shot dealing 40/75/110/145/180 (+50% Bonus AD) (+50% Bonus Movement Speed) physical damage to the first enemy she hits. Can be re-cast once within 1.5 seconds. Sallora gains a burst of 70% movement speed  that decays over 1.5 seconds if she hits an enemy champion with this ability. \n\n_Cooldown: 12/11/10/9/8 seconds\nMana Cost: 50/55/60/65/70\nRange: 700\nAnimation Time (For Re-cast): 0.2 seconds_\n\n>_*Note: Cooldown doesn't start until the ability is cast a second time. Aaaaand, the burst of movement speed stacks with itself, meaning in an ideal world with two casts in the quickest succession, she can snatch something close to 140% decaying movement speed. The 1.5 second window for the re-cast also doesn't start until the animation is over_\n\n_**W: Winding Vortex**_\nSallora whips up a small vortex that spreads outwards around her which deals 80/100/120/140/160 (+40% Bonus AD) physical damage to nearby champions and inflicts a rapidly decaying 70% slow for 1.5 seconds. Enemies are also winded by the vortex, having a mark applied to them for 3 seconds which causes them to take 50% bonus magic damage on Sallora's next ability. Sallora can only trigger the mark on one target.\n\n_Cooldown: 18/17/16/15/14 seconds\nMana Cost: 70/75/80/85/90\nEffect Radius: 380_\n\n_**E: Rapid Combat**_\nSallora hastens herself for two attacks, dashing to her target dealing 20/25/30/35/40 (+100% Total AD) attack damage, and then dashing behind that target again dealing the same damage. This happens extremely quickly.\n\n_Cooldown: 10 seconds\nMana Cost: 50\nRange: 400_\n\n_**R: Lightspeed**_\nSallora activates her whole suit to maximize speed. For 6 seconds, until she is in combat, she runs at 700/750/800 movement speed, and can cast \"In the Blink of an Eye\" infinitely at no mana cost. Additionally, within those 6 seconds, Sallora can re-activate the ability to smash a target champion with all the speed she's got dealing 100/125/150 (+20% Bonus AD) flat physical damage + 10% (+1% for every  40 bonus movement speed) missing health physical damage. \n\n_Cooldown: 100 seconds\nMana Cost: 100_\n\n>_*Note: Colliding with terrain or structures through using her Q recklessly WILL end both effects of the ultimate prematurely, so you gotta be careful with the ult!_\n\n*******************************************************************************\n\n_**Quotes**_\n\n_**Upon Selection**_\n_\"You're fast enough when you're not standing still\"_\n\n_**Upon Being Banned**_\n_\"Just too slow to understand me.

Hope it's a fun read nonetheless! :3)_\n\nSallora Pryenkhast is the daughter of a deceased scientist renowned for his creation of modern day Zaun vehicles, and his breakthroughs in aerodynamics. He was a wealthy man, and through this, and this alone, he attracted a wife, Katherine, who would become the biological mother of Sallora. In his older days, Johan, Sallora’s father grew bored, and decided to tackle a lifetime itching passion he hadn’t taken the time to explore; making man faster than the vehicles he creates. At first, it became a hobby, then routine, and then obsession. He became poor by spending money on his research, and so he stole money, more than he needed, to keep his wife in the picture. This put him in dangerous situations, one of which got him very sick. Lethally sick.\n\nIt was now that Sallora was thought of, because Johan knew he would not finish his work in his lifetime, and so demanded a child of his wife Katherine. Though Katherine hated children, she gave him a daughter named “Sallora” in the promise she would be allowed more of the shares of money he earned. Of course, now driven by unhealthy obsession, he accepted to these terms. When Sallora was finally born, Johan locked his research vault handprint recognition for his daughter to protect the information until she became of age, before loading his pistol committing suicide because he was in too much pain. Even though Johan demanded Katherine raise her until she was old enough to further his work, she wouldn’t do it. Left with no money by Johan, she was outraged, and when she found out he was poor and stealing money by asking around, she, in rage, intense poverty, and corruption, left Sallora on the streets one morning with the tag “Sallora for sale! HAHAHAHA (Actually, just take the damned bitch for free)”. Afterwards, she kept the house for herself, now resorting to crime to live as well.\n\nSallora, now starving, was found later that day by a very wealthy and tender hearted woman named Ivy, who raised her for the first 16 years of her life. On her 16th birthday exactly, Ivy was shot by a powerful Zaun gang lord, one of which Sallora’s father, Johan, had stolen a large sum from, which he explained to the child, but Sallora had no idea. The gang then took over this house, claiming the wealth from Sallora’s adopted mother in order to pay off what her father stole plus much more. Sallora, now homeless once again, wandered the streets, getting by on her own. Days past and having too much time to think, Sallora developed a strange curiosity for her existence, and where she came from. Asking anyone and everyone about Johan, she was led to his house, and led to Katherine, the one she now knew as her mother that left her to die.\n\nSallora broke through the front door, and saw no one inside. She roamed the rooms for almost an hour before finding the research vault. The instructions to the door were clear “Place Your Hand Here, Sweetie”. A little angered by being labelled by a father she never knew, the teenage girl threw her hand onto the handprint device, and the vault’s door noisily sparked into life as it opened. Much time passed, and while still in wonder exploring the room, she heard a crack, before her eyes drifted up slowly to the bullets that landed in the wall in a perfect shape around her head.\n\n“Ha, I see someone picked you up. You must think being here is your destiny or something huh, you stupid bitch? Well I got news for you, you don't f*cking belong here” shouted a woman from the other side of the room.\n\nSallora remained silent, but the woman didn't care, and reloaded her gun.\n\n\"You disgraceful daughter piece of shit. Right,\" she said, loading the last bullet.  \"The next bullets won't miss, so you be careful for mummy, okay?\" \n\nSallora turned around, ready for the barrage, and her eyes were lit up in pale pink energy. Confused, but ignorant, the woman passed it off as something stupid, and fired more bullets Sallora’s way, but despite her expert aim, Sallora, moving faster than the speed of light, dodged every bullet with ease.\n\n“What the hell is that? Johan was up to some crazy shit down here, was he?” she asked in frustration.\n\nSallora laughed, “Yeah, shit that you as a failed mother and wife don’t deserve to touch”\n\nIn the blink of an eye, Sallora was now in front of her mother, grasping her neck. The unfazed Katherine grinned a sinister grin and tried to aim her gun at Sallora, but Sallora was too quick and managed to smack it out of her hand with ease before tossing her against the wall. \n\n“And you call me the failure,\" said Sallora as she picked up the gun from the ground.  \"Hey, you wanna know how Dad died?” \n\nHer mouth began to recreate her mother's sinister grin, but only an angry defeated expression was wiped across Katherine's face in response.\n\n“A bullet. Yep, a single shot straight through the head,” she continued, considering the next course of action for a moment. Her mother rolled her eyes.\n\n“But you don’t deserve to die like him because you’re just a sad and corrupt, wealth-seeking coward, so instead, I'm giving you the chance to piss off. Does that sound good to you, _you stupid bitch?_\"\n\nShe didn't move, and Sallora sighed.\n\n\"Katherine, it's the daughterly instincts telling me to let you live. If I really share your genes, then I won't hold back and you know that, so don't make the daddy genes come out and force me to pull the trigger.”\n\nSpitting on the ground and smashing her fist against the walls repeatedly as she left the room, Katherine's last presence in Sallora's life was a slammed front door on her way out. And now, with new found technology, the sinister smiling daughter of a particularly obsessed scientist duly devoted her life to finishing her father’s work so that eventually, and ultimately, she could avenge the true second parent that she called \"mother\"; Ivy.\n\n_\"Sometimes your parents and the ones who teach you life lessons are very different people. It's up to us to decide which ones are which, and which deserve our love\"_  \n- Sallora\n\n*******************************************************************************\n\n_**Other Champions**_\n\n_Jayesh, the Schemer of the Sands - https://boards.oce.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/player-creations/9MkEkLeo-champion-concept-jayesh-the-schemer-of-the-sands_\n\n*******************************************************************************\n\n_**History**_\n**_26/11/2016_**\nBig changes to the passive, Q, and E, a minor change to the W (Now can be re-activated) and all the descriptions have been updated for clarity. (Thanks LlamaLegend :D)\n\n_**28/11/2016**_\nAdded in numbers for her abilities!\nAdded stats!\nAll her abilities have been heavily tweaked! (again :P)\nAdded short descriptions for those who would benefit from a tl:dr on the abilities! :)\n\n**_2/12/2016_** \n_Doozy time! :P_\nChanged the mark name to \"Gotcha!\" because the name didn't make sense with how it is activated through her passive :3\nI reworked her E ability again because dodging abilities from the whole team seems a little too strong, don't ya think?! (Sorry Sal, we know you're good, but you're not that good :P) Now if she wants to dodge enemy abilities, she's gonna have to use her Q ability with the right timing, which I believe is more fair! Her E ability to me seems a little less complicated than before too because of this change :3\nAdded a summary/role section! (This describes her playstyle very briefly!)\nAdded an info section! (Just some extra cool stuff about Sallora)\nAdded her short lore! (This is what you see when you click the \"lore\" of a champion in the client! :3)\nAdded her lore! (This is like a full origin story :3)\n\n**_3/12/2016_**\n_These changes are in effort to trying to make her more simple and balanced (of course)! :3_\n\"Mach Punch\" no longer consumes the mark or resets her Q cooldown when dashing through her target. The dash also doesn't deal anymore damage than the regular Mach Punch.\nBecause of the passive change, \"In the Blink of an Eye\" can be cast up to three times when the conditions are met.\n\"In the Blink of an Eye\" no longer has bonus range when cast towards her marked target, BUT, the range of the regular dashes from her passive and Q have 100 extra range always!\nChanged part of the passive's name from \"Hey, Who Did That?\" to \"Momentum\" because now the movement speed component of her E is part of this passive instead. (Again, trying to make the actual active abilities less complicated. Passives are fine)\nSemi-reverted the E change from yesterday, she can now dodge abilities from other enemies again, but only skill shots or anything dodgeable by displacing yourself. (Maybe Sal IS just that good? :P)\nThe duration of her ult now scales with rank! One less second at rank 1, but one extra second at rank 3! :3\nThe cooldown of her Q now scales with rank as well, being the previous 8 seconds only at rank 5 starting at 12 seconds at rank 1.\nThe bonus damage movement speed scaling on her Q also scales with rank! (So many scalings, right?) It's now (+55/60/65/70/75% Bonus Movement Speed) from (+65% Bonus Movement Speed) at all ranks. At the last 2 ranks, it's stronger to compensate for the Q changes!\nThe movement speed on her ult is now always the same at 50% movement speed!\nThe W's slow now always last 5 seconds instead of 2 additional seconds after the device returns. Also some changes to how the slow operates, but not too major.\nThe Q consecutive dashes now deals 50% less damage down to 15% minimum damage! (This is so then Sallora can't deal absurd amounts of damage to the whole enemy team when she's intending the damage on one target. She has to focus her targets to take them down, not just button spam and pentakill!)\nAdded most of her quotes!!! (Also swapped around the order of things e.g full lore is after the quotes which is after the full abilities) (There will be more quotes eventually, but that's most of 'em!)\nAdded a little contents section beforehand to let everyone know where things are!\n\n**_29/06/2017_**\n**REWORK**\n_CONTEXT: Her old kit was overloaded and even though it still kind of is with this update, this is a rework to try to make her, again, more simplistic, while still retaining the parts of her old kit that made her cool! Have a gander! I'd be willing to revert changes if you think it's better that way :3_\n\n_**Passive** (Reworked and renamed)_\n_CONTEXT: Out with the old, in with the new! This ability used to be a bit overly complicated, and so did the E (Chasing Game). I didn't feel like Sallora had enough damage in her kit so I also moved her W (The HVSD) into her new passive, and basically removed what she had in her old passive, reinventing parts of it into other parts of the kit (kinda)._\n\n**OLD: The Speedfreak**  _(A two part passive)_\n\n**Momentum**\nWhen Sallora takes damage from non-basic attacks, she is inflicted with the \"Slipped\" debuff which slows her movement speed over time. However, if not under the effects of \"Slipped\", she builds up that movement speed over time instead when moving towards the target marked with \"Gotcha!\"\n\n**Mach Punch**\nSallora's first basic attack on an enemy deals bonus damage based on movement speed and if it's a champion, applies the \"Gotcha!\" mark. If already applied, the attack instead roots the target while she dashes through them dealing the same damage.\n\n**NEW: Fastest Girl Alive** _(Still a two part passive)_\n\n**Quick Reflexes**\nSallora has a brief moment to dodge an enemy ability when it comes her way by clicking herself. Attacking enemies reduces the cooldown of this ability.\n\n**Can't Outrun Me!**\nSallora matches her most recently damaged target's movement speed if they are faster than her. She loses this bonus when she takes damage from a dodgeable ability or any form of CC.\n\n_**Q** (Still a dash)_\n_CONTEXT: Reworked quite a bit because relying only on one skill for damage felt a little ehh. While still a cort part of the kit, it's not the only part of the kit anymore. It's still the same combat dash-type ability more or less._\n\n**OLD: In the Blink of an Eye**\nSallora dashes to a location dealing physical damage based on her movement speed to enemies she passes through along the way. Can be re-cast if she dashes through an enemy or if used towards the target marked with \"Gotcha!\" Can be cast three times total. Consecutive dashes against the same targets deal less damage, except to the target marked with \"Gotcha!\"\n\n**NEW: In the Blink of an Eye**\nSallora dashes in a skill shot dealing physical damage to the first enemy champion hit. If she hits an enemy champion, she gains a burst of decaying movement speed. Can be re-cast once.\n\n_**W** (Insert new skill here)_\n_CONTEXT: We need new abilities to fit in place of the old ones, so this ability is all new and should give some extra stickiness/burst to Sallora._\n\n**OLD: The HVSD**\nSallora rolls a device to target location that latches to a nearby enemy, slowing over time, dealing damage over time, and marking the target with \"Gotcha!\". Sallora gains the movement speed herself when the device returns which happens after the slow reaches maximum strength or when re-activated. The slow always lasts the same amount no matter when the device is returned, but will not deal any additional damage or increase in slow strength. The slow strength decreases over the last second always.\n\n**NEW: Winding Vortex**\nSallora deals damage to nearby enemy champions, slowing them greatly for a split second, and causing them to take additional damage from Sallora's next ability.\n\n_**E** (Also insert new skill here)_\n_CONTEXT: Completely reworked. The new ability is kinda like her old Mach Punch passive effect, in spirit at least._\n\n**OLD: The Chasing Game**\nIf not under the effects of \"Slipped\", Sallora, for a few seconds, reveals the target marked with \"Gotcha!\" and during this time, can sidestep a short distance when abilities come her way or are near her. This can block basic attacks, AoEs, and targeted abilities if the caster was the marked target, but only functions as a sidestep against other enemies. Coming under the effects of \"Slipped\" ends the spell early. Sallora sidesteps on the initial cast if and when a spell is nearby, and dodges all previously stated effects regardless of who the caster was.\n\n**NEW: Rapid Combat**\nSallora dashes to her target dealing physical damage, and then behind them dealing the same damage again.\n\n_**R** (Faster than ever!)_\n_CONTEXT: Still a buffing ability, but has a completely different ring to it now._\n\n**OLD: Faster than Light**\nSallora breaks free from \"Slipped\", and for a few seconds, cannot come under its effects, gains bonus movement speed, is able to move through units, and sustains her own movement speed increasing effects. Moving through enemy champions marked with \"Gotcha!\" deals physical damage.\n\n**NEW: Lightspeed**\nFor a short period of time, Sallora moves insanely fast, and can cast \"In the Blink of an Eye\" infinitely at no mana cost until she is in combat. She can re-activate the ability to deal missing health damage to her target. Colliding with a wall ends the whole effect.\n\n**_12/05/2018_**\nAdded an \"Other Champions\" section and linked Jayesh in there.\n\n*******************************************************************************\n\nSo that's it!!! If you made it this far, thank you, you're really awesome! I've reworked this champion so many times in my head, and this is the best I could do, so maybe you could help me out? I'm not a very good maths guy either when it comes to League of Legends numbers for abilities, so if you see something insanely broken or completely useless, please let me know in the comments, and if there's a cool speedster fantasy I haven't really covered, let me know as well and let's try to make all the fantasies come true! Again, thanks for reading :D\n \n{{sticker:slayer-jinx-catface}}","replies":[{"poster":"LlamaLegend","date":"2016-11-26T09:31:49.034+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Honestly, this sounds like a great idea. Obviously some of the abilities would need a touch up, maybe the E is a little to broken but it could work in some way.\nI do like the current skillset you have come up with, but what would be cool as part of the \"quick reflexes\" passive she gains bonus movement speed when heading towards them. Her W is interesting, I would keep the whole stealing movement speed thing, but maybe as the enemy is drained of their movement speed she gains it? With her E there should be a short window to dodge abilities with, and shouldn't have the cool down reset (maybe).  Maybe she could have an ability called \"speed demon\" where enemies marked with \"stolen velocity\" are rooted and Sallora dashes to them? I don't know. I think its a great champion design and certainly has a lot of potential.
