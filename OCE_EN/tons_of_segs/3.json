When Ranked becomes more casual then Normal&#039;s, that starts to become a problem. \r\n\r\nLook, I&#039;m sure, no one from Riot will even bother reading this, but if you are, I feel that you need to put your foot down with this. I don&#039;t want to move server with a higher ping just to play the mode I want.\r\n\r\nIs there a reason? Is it on player count? size? TOO MANY KANGAROOS AND KIWI&#039;S?!\r\n\r\nI just want a reason.\r\n\r\nFrom a Forgotten OCE Player","replies":[{"poster":"Ing√©nue","date":"2016-05-05T00:16:17.175+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"TL;DR our server is too small population wise.\n\nEvaluations to open the queue happen regularly (as does for TT permanent/ranked) however it does not look like anything is going to change anytime soon. \n\nRead more about it on[ THIS](http://boards.oce.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/announcements/VdoPT9GX-queue-schedule) thread. <-- will be updated if anything changed.","replies":[{"poster":"Tons of Segs","date":"2016-05-05T03:26:55.769+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thanks for showing me this.\n\nSorry for more or less complaining about the same thing everyone else does.","replies":[]}]}]}
