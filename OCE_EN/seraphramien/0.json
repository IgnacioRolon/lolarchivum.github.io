Any good yasuo player will just farm, and as hard as any player might try to stop this as soon as his crit gets going and shiv get built its so hard to counter him mid game which often snowballs into late game. I&#039;ve countered yas before with zyra, wu, and even galio, but doubling his crit it too much.","replies":[{"poster":"JasonWazza","date":"2016-07-01T03:10:51.921+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I don't recall the last time i have seen a shiv Yasuo, most of them go PD these days.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Talon12","date":"2016-07-01T03:15:33.921+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"No. A good yasuo player will farm and get kills, while not dying. Which is super rare, because the good yasuo players are nearly extinct, been replaced with douchebags who think he is easy and op, then do nothing but feed their asses off.\n\nPeople need to stop complaining, he is really underpowered compared to other champs, the only reason he does well every so often is because that person has enough brains to do half decent mechanical plays.\n\nYas has one of the highest percentile of champs that counter him as well.","replies":[]}]}
