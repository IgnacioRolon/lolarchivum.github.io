You should have also received an email about the suspension to the registered email address. In that case, you have the option of appealing the suspension with Support (use the same link from before, but instead choose the \"Account suspensions or restrictions\" option) if you believe you were falsely punished. Keep in mind, it may take several days to receive a response (particularly if Support is busy), you may receive a \"generic copy-paste\" response, and they're decision is final.","replies":[]}]}
