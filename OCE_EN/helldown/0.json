I tried clicking into it again, but it did not work out. so I had to shut the whole computer down and restart it, which was apparently not enough time to get back into the game, and it resulted in a demotion and five 20-min bans. This was unfair, as my computer was working perfectly fine. i do not mind about the demotion, but please do something about this, and possibly get my 20 min bans off please. Thanks","replies":[{"poster":"Galacius","date":"2018-03-26T03:54:24.321+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey there HellDown,\n\nUnfortunately, Riot will not undo a 20 minute [Leaverbuster](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752714-LeaverBuster-FAQ) under any circumstances as they don't know if you purposely caused the crash or if it was on their end. However, you can play 5 games without leaving to remove the leaverbuster from your games. Also, I'd recommend running a full file repair (click the cog wheel at the top right of the client) and see if that works. If you still have the crashing issue, then I would recommend running the [Hextech Repair Tool](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/224826367-Automated-Troubleshooting-Hextech-Repair-Tool). Let me know if this fixes the problem!","replies":[]}]}
