The problem seems to be my internet since my other games like Hearthstone and even twitch.tv has been frequently d&#039;cing. I&#039;ve tried all the troubleshooting methods so far and I&#039;ve concluded the problem isn&#039;t my wifi connection, or the speed. Instead, I reckon the culprit is packet loss. I used the netalyzer and it stated my &quot;network has indicated bursts of packet loss&quot;. \r\n\r\nI&#039;ve contacted my ISP (iiNet) and they need more information to resolve this case. They reckon its the game server&#039;s fault. I need some methods so show them that real problem is packet loss. \r\n\r\nISP: iiNet\r\nLocation: Melbourne","replies":[{"poster":"Riot Cochese","date":"2015-06-17T07:04:26.250+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You can try running a traceroute to iiNets DNS server: 203.0.178.191 and share the results with them. It would be hard to argue the results when you are pinging their own internal network.\n\nAlso try downloading winmtr and run that, it will give you some solid data to provide the iiNet tech support team. http://winmtr.net/download-winmtr/\n\nSorry to hear you hare having issues, but glad to read you are troubleshooting to get down to the root cause. Let me know what they come back with.\n\nPS - it's not best to play games over wifi. We do recommend that you plug a cable into the router from your PC.","replies":[{"poster":"Decarnia","date":"2015-06-19T13:09:59.891+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It's been weird. My results have shown no obvious packet losses so far. Right now my internet can even watch youtube or twitch in HD smoothly, but I still get the same lag on League.\n\nI've tested using an ethernet cable and a different computer however I yield the same results. I know I have an internet problem, not a league-related problem because other games like Hearthstone has to reconnect constantly. \n\nI wonder if pinging the OCE servers would even show packet loss, plus I can't find the ip address for it. \n\nI'm pretty much out of options. I just finished exams and all I wanna do is play League.

You could very well be getting this as a constant effect, but it's not noticeable on Twitch or Youtube as it uses completely different methods that aren't affected by something like that.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"HORSE OF FORCE","date":"2015-06-18T14:28:06.258+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"(your link is dead, or maybe the site went down as I happened to check it)\n\n{{champion:119}}\n\nEdit: Yep, it was just down right as I was checking it.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"HORSE OF FORCE","date":"2015-06-17T04:58:06.653+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Well, you could send them the logs of Berkeley's test.
