Pressing ctrl+alt+delete will open the correct screen as expected, however the game cannot be closed by any means, I&#039;ve tried task hacker, and others but the game simply cannot be closed.

Below I will leave as much information as possible, and if I have ruined one of your games, I&#039;m sorry.\r\n\r\nToshiba Satellite L50-A\r\n(Not sure if this is specific enough)\r\nSpotify and Skype seem to make this occur more often (?)\r\nI think it has to do with my graphics card (Nvidia GeForce GT 740M) also a Intel Graphics 4600 (This is the integrated one [?])\r\nAnd that&#039;s all I can think of the top of my head, my computer has had its drivers updated recently so there&#039;s that","replies":[{"poster":"Mindstar","date":"2015-10-27T23:01:17.855+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey,\n\nSorrey to hear you're having problems, but I think you are on the right track with the driver updates.  Does this problem happen every game you play? or only sometimes?\n\nOne page that might help is the support page on [game crashes](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201761974-Bug-Splat-and-Game-Crashes) - the suggestions in there might give you some more things to try.\n\nLet me know how you go.\n\n\nCheers\nMindstar","replies":[]}]}
