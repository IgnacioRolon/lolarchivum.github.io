Compliments on actual good plays by your teammates help.  Thank that morg for the clutch shield that saved your life (after you're safely out of combat), thank the support that made your adc look good, the jungler who managed that clutch countergank.   Even when the play didn't work, but was well thought out, it's worth mentioning.  If a top spends TP to try and swing my bot lane, I say thanks, even if all we did was chase them off and get to reset the lane.\n\nI even compliment anyone who is willing to suffer playing a tank toplane or jg, and have a hard lane so you have good teamfights.   Doing this and keeping quiet about peoples failures (most of the time) has got my 3 accts to lvl 5 honor without particularly trying.  It does take a fair few games though.","replies":[]}]}
