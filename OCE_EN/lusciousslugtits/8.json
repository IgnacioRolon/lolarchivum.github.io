I would say my main roles would probably be top and ADC at the moment though if your team is looking for another role i would be happy to trial with the team and practice in my spare time the role. As for communication i am more then happy to use any program i already have or install another if needed. \r\n\r\nIf you are interested feel free to add me on league IGN: Hashshashin or message me on here and ill respond to any questions or add you myself.","replies":[]}
