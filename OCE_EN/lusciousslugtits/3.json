I have been playing for a while so i'm fine with most roles though would prefer not to go with support though if needed might consider it.\n\nOn a side note also willing to duo with probably anyone of any rank as long as you don't go negative every game.","replies":[{"poster":"I are Goat","date":"2015-07-12T05:31:49.583+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey pal,\n\nI'm also looking for people to play ranked with.
