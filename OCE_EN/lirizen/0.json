We are looking for a team within the Gold - Platinum elo range and available on the weekends. Our team consists of 4 gold players and 1 silver. We are mainly looking for a BO1 but if we have time, we can potentially make it a BO3. You must have your own team of 5 players. If you would like to discuss anything further, please comment about it :)\n\nThanks.","replies":[{"poster":"Fiora Bot","date":"2019-11-25T00:12:49.897+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"plat 2 mid ekko main","replies":[]},{"poster":"Twisted Hand","date":"2019-11-24T06:31:01.759+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Ign: Twisted Hand\nDisc: PrakritD#9585\nWell rounded G1 Jungler\nMain Champs: Mundo, Kha, LeeSin, ekko\nBut can play most jungle champs\nLane impact focused","replies":[]}]}
