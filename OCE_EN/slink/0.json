What really matters is what the new leveling and Blue Essence system is going to be like in the longer term, ie levels 150-175+ where it levels out.\n\nBefore anyone jumps on the &quot;you&#039;re just young and entitled, be happy with what you got, just play the game&quot; bandwagon, all I&#039;m asking for is accurate information here, nothing more.","replies":[]}
