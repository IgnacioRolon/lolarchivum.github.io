Very sorry that you experienced this issue - we looked into it and found the problem.  The missions should be functioning properly now, and games watched moving forward will count toward your mission.  We'll also look to retroactively grant mission credit to those watching eligible games during the outage, but this could take a little while.  Thank you for the report, and sorry for the inconvenience! \n\n{{sticker:sg-janna}}","replies":[{"poster":"Blizzy","date":"2019-04-11T06:15:45.862+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Cheers for addressing the issue","replies":[]},{"poster":"silverarc","date":"2019-04-11T10:19:32.700+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Good Job{{sticker:slayer-pantheon-thumbs}}","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"SiriusBro","date":"2019-04-11T09:01:00.043+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thaanks for looking into and resolving the issue!","replies":[]},{"poster":"Anchovica","date":"2019-04-10T18:10:43.074+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yes, even watching the full 1 hour vod doesn't count to the mission, though it's meant to register after 10 minutes of it","replies":[{"poster":"Gehirn","date":"2019-04-11T01:38:02.551+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hi Lunami, looking at your account, you're currently 2/3 games watched towards mission completion.\n\nIt looks like you didn't watch game 1 of the series for long enough to complete the mission.

The games only registered during the live broadcast and I've had trouble completing it with the VOD\n\nEdit: I saw the fix after replying, thank you for fixing it","replies":[]},{"poster":"Blizzy","date":"2019-04-11T01:41:24.770+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hi Gehirn,\n\nHow long do you have to watch the vods for? I skip the intro stuff and get right into the action. I watched the majority of game 2 and all of game 3 just now, having skimmed game 1. I did use the specific website in question as well. The mission just isn't updating in the missions tab or my client so I'm not sure if I'm doing it right. Do I have to fully watch all 3 before it updates properly and completes? Or should it have shown me \"2/3 completed\"? More than happy to go and watch game 1 but if it's bugged and hasn't registered the other 2 I watched then I might not bother. \n\nCheers","replies":[{"poster":"Gehirn","date":"2019-04-11T01:45:55.917+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hmm your case is more concerning because from what I can see you're sitting at 0/3 watched. Are you referring to the mission on this account that you're logged into now and are you certain you're logged in with this account on watch.oce.lolesports.com? (Blizzy)\n\nI believe the mission considers the game watched if you watch for at least 10 minutes but we recommend watching for 15 minutes just to be safe.\n\nEDIT: also make sure you're opted in to rewards on [this page](http://watch.lolesports.com/rewards)!","replies":[{"poster":"Blizzy","date":"2019-04-11T01:49:20.156+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yep, definitely logged into that account, and in the top right corner it says \"Opt out of rewards here\" with a game being previously watched so it's okay, I just won't bother completing the mission.
