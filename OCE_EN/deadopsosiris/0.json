I feel like Zoe should have an SG skin! I think that it would suit her really well, and whilst looking through fan arts I found this and it reminded me to make a board! cause I honestly think it would go so well! \r\n\r\nNow now I know, Zoe doesn not like Lux, so bla bla bla. whatever, but she thinks Ezreal is super cute and really seems to like yordles, so it would make sense she joined just for Ez, or perhaps to be friends with Poppy and Lulu! \r\n\r\nI really hope others agree! Please get behind this! I would love to see this be a thing!           {{champion:142}}","replies":[{"poster":"Talon12","date":"2018-08-09T00:50:16.622+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"that looks like something someone made to fulfill their lolita fantasies.","replies":[{"poster":"DeadOpsOsiris","date":"2018-08-09T01:09:07.985+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I know I know, but still, best one I could find and it's there for reference.","replies":[{"poster":"Talon12","date":"2018-08-09T07:25:52.681+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"supposed leak she was getting one, dont know about its authenticity, but could go something like a jannaesque appeal by poutie\n\nhttps://orig00.deviantart.net/a0cc/f/2017/352/2/c/sgzoe_by_poutie-dbx507v.png","replies":[{"poster":"DeadOpsOsiris","date":"2018-08-10T01:17:11.395+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"That's awesome!
