I mean there's the usual banter and not so harsh comments, but recently I feel as the overall ranked community has become very verbally abusive which has affected pretty much more than half of the games I've played negatively. Also correct me if I'm wrong, but does OCE have a proper tribunal system in place? My friends and I haven't been reporting people under the impression that there's not tribunal.  Sorry if this comes off as a qq post, but I'm legitimately interested whether this is the case or not.\r\n\r\nWhat do you guys think?","replies":[{"poster":"dmghero","date":"2014-11-29T04:03:06.208+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"sadly if you look around, you will find that OCE is the most toxic server.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Rok","date":"2014-11-19T22:18:47.084+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I dont think it has gotten more toxic, i think the population has expanded to include little kids still in highschool who havnt matured.
