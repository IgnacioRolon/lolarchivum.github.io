It will be back up 1300 GMT+12. Given that I was playing one for all last night and was getting instant queues I would say that One for all is at least as popular as URF. I don't think there should be any restriction on a weekend game mode, I'm quite happy to wait 5 min for even a game of hexakill, especially since the queue windows are based on AEST,which is two hours behind me and I have work in the afternoon.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Technoman21","date":"2016-05-06T21:57:56.338+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"same issue here, i dunno whats causing it{{sticker:zombie-nunu-bummed}}","replies":[]}]}
