Yes I am admitting it and I need help. So I am at my second punishment in which we have 25 games chat restrictions I&#039;m currently at 10. And after that it&#039;s gonna be two weeks ban then perma which I don&#039;t want. So I wanted some help to how to avoid getting toxic rage and other stuff, I also saw one post on NA board which some rioter spoke about how to avoid these which was 2 paragraphs of shit that didn&#039;t helped at all. So yea whoever see me in their team should not expect a good attitude thanks\r\nAnd why is my post getting deleted??","replies":[{"poster":"EzeBlood","date":"2017-04-11T02:19:35.585+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I've dealt with anger issues before, and I found that it's seriously so easy to find a way around them. I can now proudly say, I haven't been properly angry in six whole years. What's my secret, you ask? It's a mixture of things. Firstly, whenever you feel a rage coming on, stop. Back away from the situation, and just breathe. Think about how little this will matter to you in a month, two months, a year even. Secondly, think of everyone you meet online as though you were talking to Her Royal Majesty Queen Elizabeth II. I know it sounds ridiculous, but trust me, it works. Even if the Queen was telling you to 'go f*** yourself', or calling you 's***face', you wouldn't retaliate, because she's the Queen. Furthermore, just reading the insults in that posh, British voice is enough to make most people laugh it off and realise that it isn't as bad as they think. Finally - and I think this is quite possibly the best thing you can do to stop getting yourself angry - stop caring. If you don't care what other people say or do, then why should it affect you? Really, the easiest way to dampen your flames and cure your toxicity is to simply not care.\n\nEveryone plays at their own skill level; play at yours. If your teammates aren't playing at your level, that's fine. They are them, and you are you.\n\nThanks for the read, hope I helped in some way.","replies":[]},{"poster":"JesusForgotHisGA","date":"2017-04-10T20:15:18.474+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"In all seriousness, the best thing you can do is unbind the chat key. That way when you feel like lashing out at others you get a few seconds to think about it and calm down as you rebind the key (if you even get that far). I find by the time I've thought about going into the settings menu etc and doing all that shit I calm down, shrug it off and move on because it's just not worth it.\n\nIt sucks not being able to freely type, but if you're having troubles restraining from using the chat maybe it's a better option?","replies":[]},{"poster":"Ing√©nue","date":"2017-04-09T10:37:18.869+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"#Easiest way to stay toxicity ban free?\n\n[Verbalise your insults instead of typing them.](https://boards.oce.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/player-behaviour/KKWYyk6M-guide-to-reforming-and-staying-punishment-free-oe)\n\nIt's good that you are admitting that you're toxic and that you need to change your behavior before you punishment escalates to the point you lose your account. It can be pretty hard to contain those outbursts, and it's something you are going to have to work on. \n\nIf it doesn't work out for you, I would suggest looking into games where your behavior won't have such an impact on others.","replies":[{"poster":"zYasuo","date":"2017-04-09T10:43:32.820+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Well that helped out lmao","replies":[{"poster":"Talon12","date":"2017-04-10T08:55:27.649+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"disable all chat, and mute everyone, cant be toxic if no one can hear it.\n\nIt also doesn't hurt to actually type out the crap you want to say, but instead of hitting enter afterwards, press control+a then hit backspace instead.","replies":[{"poster":"zYasuo","date":"2017-04-10T15:26:06.849+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thanks for the advice, thats the best one i have got in this discussion.
