Not that it matters but I own every champ and I have a skin or two for at least half of them, more if you include a couple other accounts that I have played on, that also have skins and name changes etc, I even have screenshots of end results in a game I played against Phreak in season 2 in a ranked 5&#039;s match. I put countless hours into this game and not once has riot acknowledged, rewarded, or catered for me, I even got placed into low priority queues for briefly disconnecting in a ranked game one time which I was really pissed off about as someone who plays as much as I do.\r\n\r\nI feel like riot only wants to cater for uni students and the esports scene. I&#039;m 21, I don&#039;t go to uni, I work full time as a chef for a living and usually at obscure hours where queue times have become a nightmare with the new ranked queues, I play league to escape from the stress of life, I play competitively (ranked) but I also play for fun at the same time. As a veteran player I have seen the game transform, becoming slightly more intricate each patch from visual updates to game mechanics, but I fear league has reached it&#039;s peak and will die off in a matter of a couple years, the game has lost it&#039;s charm and not only isn&#039;t half as fun as it used to be, but i&#039;ve seen the game bend over backwards to satisfy an elitist esport community and removed most of the things that made the game fun. For example you could build dps Alistair and solo baron. There was a fan made mode called &quot;Braver Mode&quot; where you and your premades would all pick random in champ select and lock in and you would have to build, Leviathan, Sword of the Occult, Mejais, Tiamat (Ravenous Hydra didn&#039;t exist back then), Trinity Force and Boots (Upgrade is optional). You could build Philosophers Stone and Heart of Gold in the jungle and as support and actually have an income in the game as a support/support jungler. You would see Nikasaur in the corner of the client with a new Summoner Spotlight. There is none of that shit now, the game has been tightened and tuned to the point where if you&#039;re not up to date with what the professionals are building and copy their builds, you will not have fun, you&#039;re likely to lose if you think you want to build alternatively. They have tweaked the game to balance everything out and reworked so many champions trying to fix it so that the game is a level playing field that there is little variety to what you can actually build on a champion, you get a few item choices to play around with but essentially your build is going to look similar every time until a rework or buff/nerf to certain items or champions.\r\n\r\nObviously I&#039;m not expecting this to have an appeal to Riot and it&#039;s not likely that my ramble will make them want to make the game fun again, however I would very much appreciate it if there were more tournaments and events for unprofessional players, more opportunity to establish yourself as a player in the game other than grinding out solo queue until you rank up and get into a team good enough to get noticed, the uni events are a step in the right direction but what about the people who don&#039;t go to uni? I know there are tournaments to win skins and rp, but there is little information on them and are usually hosted by third party companies, it&#039;s like Riot wants us to just sit and watch their professional tournaments and never really have a chance to participate ourselves.\r\n\r\n(TL;DR)\r\n\r\nCan Riot please make it easier to access low key tournaments for people who aren&#039;t on a professional team or have a uni squad. You&#039;re neglecting a large amount of the community.","replies":[{"poster":"P0Ps","date":"2016-03-10T10:40:22.648+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"http://events.oce.leagueoflegends.com/","replies":[{"poster":"lataz bo","date":"2016-03-10T11:27:37.207+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yeah there's a few other links for various tournaments, but most require you to have team to play and like I said, I play at obscure hours most of the time so i'm usually playing against a handful of the same people every night, I'm restricted to finding people to play with on very specific and small slots of time.\n\nOn another point, although it's not hard to get to those links, if they can advertise for uni teams why can't they pop a small advertisement in for local events, and rookie tournaments on the client when you load in, there's always more than one advertisement on rotation anyway, I doubt it would break the client.","replies":[{"poster":"P0Ps","date":"2016-03-11T03:21:36.259+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I understand that you don't wanna have to find a team yourself, but try looking at the Team recruitment forum, I'm sure you can find people that play at the same time somewhere on there. Or if you find someone in a game that you along with, add them after and ask them if they are interested in playing a tournament with you sometime. In terms of local events, that would require riot to track where you live and change the client for each individual. The reason that riot doesn't advertise for rookie tournaments is most likely due to the fact that they don't have any benefit from it. They benefit significantly by advertising for the regional and big tournaments particularly cause they are hosted by Riot (I think), the reason they benefit from Uni is that because a large chunk of players are in uni and it also advertises the game a lot in the university. Riot just doesn't benefit very much from advertising smaller/rookie tournaments, and if they did, they probably wouldn't stay rookie tournaments for long.","replies":[{"poster":"lataz bo","date":"2016-03-11T06:59:37.857+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thanks for the insight man, I understand why riot does things the way they do, but I still personally think that riot definitely does benefit enough from rookie players, it's the most played game in the world and they don't really need to spare much effort. It's no doubt easier for them to do that for the big and regional tournaments and for uni students, but it by no means is out of their power or benefit to do something a lot more low key for the population of players (it'd be a lot) who don't fit into uni students or professional players, I think you have completely misunderstood my stance here, I'm not asking riot to do anything other than a \"click here for information on rookie tournaments\" somewhere on the client with a link to some where you can easily navigate through to find documented rookie tournaments and local events (if there are any).","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Hyde","date":"2016-03-10T10:56:39.994+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I kinda feel you, I haven't played for as long as you but I do agree on some points. I think what annoys me most about this game is that they change a lot of champions around but never touch some of the others. Like they did a whole set of changes to lots of already kinda good champions but I haven't even seen Galio get changed up (apart from the visual update a while ago) and he still had pretty much the lowest win rate I the game. One thing I do respect about the game is the fact they haven't made it pay to win. Like you can't even buy runes with real money. If they do make it pay to win. then I will consider the game ruined. I still have a good time playing it and enjoy watching the Esports side of it. I think playing with friends is a lot of fun but I also enjoy the competitive side of solo ranked. I think there is issues with salty people though. Your point about having tournaments for unpros and not just for teams would be awesome! I would be super keen to enter some and just have a good competitive time.\nNice post, I am glad it wasn't just another salty person complaining about how all the report system is broken. and how .. this ... and all this... and such like. I like where you are coming from. Hopefully we will see something more happen for the lower end of players. We shall see.
