We love laughing about the threads on /r/leagueoflegends while trying to help each other climb into Gold. \r\n\r\nSince we enjoy the Challenger and Champions scene so much in other regions, we&#039;ve always been interested in starting our own team and wondering what it would be like to coordinate lane swaps, early tower dives, setting up vision control, and rotations through Skype or TeamSpeak with 3 others who enjoy the game as much as we do!\r\n\r\nBoth of us are smart kids, 22 years old, and easy to play with. If the above sounds like you as well, and you love playing Mid, Jungle, or Top -- and you&#039;re anywhere from Bronze I to Silver I -- and looking to learn and climb with some new friends, then please feel free to add us on the client next time you&#039;re on so we can get to know you better! \r\n\r\n^_^\r\n\r\nIf posting here is more convenient for you, go ahead and leave your name and I&#039;ll add you next time I&#039;m on. :)\r\n\r\nOne thing we want to make clear though, and something we&#039;ve had a problem with in normal 5s is Shot-calling. Ins41n3 and I have a very clear idea of how we want to play the game because of how much time we spend watching the game at a high level. We really want some outside perspective and some friends we can bounce ideas off of but we&#039;re confident in our knowledge of the game and we&#039;re not looking for any type of leader. We are the respective Uzi and Mata of our roles (lol) and we work well together because of it. We may not be the greatest with our hands but we&#039;re Challenger in the head and the heart! \r\n\r\nWe just need a PawN, Huni, and Rush to make this as fun as possible. \r\n\r\nxD\r\n\r\nTL;DR - Looking for a (Bronze I to Silver I) Mid, Jungle, and Top for a new Ranked 5s team who is mature, calm, and ready to enjoy the way this game is meant to be played. :)","replies":[{"poster":"Ins41n3","date":"2015-05-26T07:19:39.676+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Am Mata can confirm I bathe in the {{item:3070}}  of my nemesise","replies":[]},{"poster":"Sha4o4","date":"2015-05-25T10:45:20.849+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"i play Main MId if you want to just add me up GBG727","replies":[]},{"poster":"ImtheAnimal","date":"2015-05-24T21:16:35.822+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"hey buddy im keen I main jg but can top and sup too other areas not great at yet.
