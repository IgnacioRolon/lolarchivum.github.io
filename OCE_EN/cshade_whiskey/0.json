It has dual graphics cards; an NVIDIA GeForce 540M and an Intel HD 5500. It is meant to switch between the two- Intel for everyday use, and the NVIDIA card for gaming and more graphically demanding applications. It runs Windows 7 Professional.\n\nI can progress through making a custom game, champ select etc fine; it is simply when I want to start the game and hit the loading screen, that I come across this issue. As the game is trying to make it to the loading screen, it crashes and I receive the error message \"An unknown DirectX error has occurred and League of Legends cannot start. Please make sure your video card is using the latest video drivers from the manufacturer\". ok.\n\nSo I have ensured all my drivers etc are all up to date, I&#039;ve had the IT guys at my father&#039;s workplace have a look at it... and they are unsure. They say it may be something to do with the settings of either the game/ or the graphics card. Does anyone know what I need to do to fix this \"unknown directX issue\"? I shall be eternally thankful :D hahaha\n\nAttached is a screenshot of the error message.\n\nThanks guys!","replies":[{"poster":"HORSE OF FORCE","date":"2015-04-10T10:06:27.638+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":">ultrabook\n\nThey are not designed to run games. They are designed to be compact and battery efficient.\n\nNevertheless, it runs Windows, and thus should be able to work. You said that it's meant to switch between the graphics cards when appropriate; have you made sure that it's designed to switch when League is running? Remember, League has around five .exe files that need to be greenlit.\n\n[You can also just try installing DirectX manually.](http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=35)","replies":[{"poster":"CShade Whiskey","date":"2015-04-11T11:08:36.501+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"yup, i know. I bought it mainly for uni purposes, however I like to casually play League. I bought the monitor in order to have better vision while playing the game.\n\nBut yeah I have tried to change settings in the NVIDIA control center, to no avail. I have also uninstalled and reinstalled both drivers for each graphics card.... with no effect\n\nhowever, what do you mean by the five .exe files?\n\nthanks for your help :)","replies":[{"poster":"HORSE OF FORCE","date":"2015-04-11T12:02:21.719+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"If you view your task manager while opening up League, you'll see many executables being run just to get the patcher up and running. In game, there's usually around four executables running. You can kill all of them and still play, but you'll have connection issues after a bit. If any of those executables are being blocked, that might be why you're running into trouble.","replies":[]}]}]}]}
