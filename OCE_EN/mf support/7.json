She also has one of the lowest movements speeds in the game.\n\nWhile she is good at zoning, she gets stomped pretty hard if you get up in her face (like leo/malph). \n\nThe biggest zyra counterplay is taking notice of her seed placements, and to step on them as soon as it is safe. If she can't get her plants up, she isn't really that useful. \n\nShe is like Lux and brand, one of the champions that do best in the midlane, but also do quite well as an AP support. Ofc they do way more damage than a nami/lulu, because that is how they hold their own as a solo laner. \n\nEasiest way to learn to counterplay a champion is to either use google, or actually play the champion. Get a feel for their cooldowns, powerspikes, item paths, combos, and a general feel for what they are trying to achieve at each point of the game (laning/roaming/teamfight).","replies":[]}]}
