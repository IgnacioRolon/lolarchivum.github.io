The issue with scripts is basically just riot putting effort into other things and turning a blind eye, rather than trying to get into a war to deal with scripters.

It's like Anti-virus vs Virus, they both have to be constantly evolving to try and stay one step ahead of the other, it's not a static solution but rather a dynamic one.\n\n> Time spent countering scripters is time not spent dealing with bugs, competitive balance issues, the more controversial elements of the game and such.\n\nThe thing you seem to be misunderstanding is that Riot isn't one big team. The art teams are separate from the dev teams who are separate from the community teams who are separate from the balance teams who are separate from the champion design teams and so on. Time spent countering scripters does not affect time spent on anything else in the slightest.","replies":[{"poster":"Nightjar","date":"2016-11-11T00:10:41.410+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> The scripts ARE constantly evolving and so are Riot&#x27;s countermeasures.

With antivirus, you can't just go to google, the top viruses whereas the most common scripts are in the first few google scripts.\nThat said I acknowledge the issues with trying to stay up to date on these considering the sparsity of patches and also identifying accounts that have been using such programs, especially since antivirus primarily needs to focus on security, whereas riot has to primarily focus on the ongoing development of their game.\n\n> The thing you seem to be misunderstanding is that Riot isn&#x27;t one big team.
