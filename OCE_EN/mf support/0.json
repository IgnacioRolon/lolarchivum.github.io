If a player is caught smurfing, BAN ALL OF THEIR ACCOUNTS (The only way it will stop).\r\n\r\nIt is highly unfair to new and returning players to get smashed every single game by players who don&#039;t give a single shit about the community.","replies":[{"poster":"Chalze","date":"2016-11-07T09:26:56.407+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"How about you not spam the boards with the same topic?","replies":[]},{"poster":"Mortis Ex","date":"2016-11-11T10:59:35.219+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"LOL rito just made it faster and easier to level up accounts and made runes cheaper. Do you see this as a way to encourage or discourage smurfs? People who are learning the game should be playing lots of norms to learn, not getting to lvl 30 faster so they can hit ranked. People who got banned just create a new account and can play on it within days if they are willing to spend a little on XP boosts. \nPros and streamers smurf all the time, even \"gatekeeping\" certain divs, trolling team mates promos and tryharding opponents promos. What fantastic role models for every other div. So challengers troll diamonds, diamonds troll plats, and so on down the line. \nRito implicitly condones smurfing and just falls back to the old, play enough games and it all averages out theory. Also, more smurfs means more money as people buy skins, even gifting people who carry them through games, like smurfs stomping all over the other team. And once tencent bought rito, you had to know it would get worse rather than better. They want to milk every dollar they can out of it and they only care about players as far as their wallet.","replies":[]},{"poster":"BarryButcher","date":"2016-11-07T04:48:50.313+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"How about instead, let people have a 2nd account they don't have to level, however it is linked to their original, so any punishments on one happen to both.","replies":[{"poster":"Ing√©nue","date":"2016-11-07T22:11:47.324+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"this would be the best action to take imo.
