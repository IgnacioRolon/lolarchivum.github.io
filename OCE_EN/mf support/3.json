If you see or hear about another person breaking the rules, send us a ticket directly so we can investigate and take action if necessary. We know that players report publicly with the best intentions, but it often leads to a witchhunt, rarely resulting in a positive discussion. We'll be taking action against players who have violated rules, so please report these players correctly.\n\nModerators will be looking for the following:\n\n* Posts that accuse others of being toxic players in-game\n* Posts accusing others of malicious activity\n* Posts that accuse others of cheating or using illegal services\n* Posts accusing others of trolling in the boards (thereâ€™s a report button for that)\"","replies":[]}]}
