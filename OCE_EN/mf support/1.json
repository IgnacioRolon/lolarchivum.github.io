As a good rule of thumb, it's always good to have *some* experience in 3 or 4 positions, with the 1 or 2 you prefer above all others being focused on more. You can easily get *some* experience by playing against intermediate bots and practising on aspects you feel you are lacking in. For example, you might feel that your last hitting as a Mid laner is lackluster so you play a \"typical\" mid laner and focus on that for a few games.\n\nAfter you've got some experience from that, it can be good to queue in PVP with some friends or acquaintances who understand your situation (that you're relatively new and still learning) so you can get some proper experience against other players. If you don't know anyone as of yet, I'd suggest making a thread in the \"Team Recruitment\" section of the boards to find players who would be willing to assist.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"FatedSaviour","date":"2016-11-22T23:57:57.951+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"play top lane a bit, makes you experienced with most lanes, gives you a chance to practice last hitting (almost 2 years in, i still suck at it) and if u get stuck with jg, well, ummm, gg no re","replies":[]},{"poster":"ToxicPretzel","date":"2016-11-19T03:33:59.295+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"in my experience there's just as many chill people as there are toxic people, so don't let this discourage you.\nIf your team is flaming you and it's affecting your play, just hit esc, go to your setting and turn off chat.
