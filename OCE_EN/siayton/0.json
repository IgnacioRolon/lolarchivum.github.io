Support Vel no longer viable.","subforum":"Gameplay & Strategy","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"Long time Velkoz main here, played him up until Diamond and really loved the character. Many people praised Velkoz for being one of the most balanced and well designed champions in the game. Being all relatively slow skill shots with high reward, there was always room to outplay and be outplayed with Velkoz and it almost never felt like you were being cheesed out by him like some of the other champions with less counterplay. This is why I&#039;m REALLY confused as to why Riot pushed him in the direction they did. They disguised it as a &quot;slight rework&quot; but in actuality almost ALL of the changes were a MASSIVE nerf to Velkoz&#039;s playstyle and have helped push him in the direction of a very binary single target burst mage that&#039;s very reliant on AP and gold and less of a target agnostic AOE god of destruction and utility. Yay homogenization. \r\n\r\nDid I mention _**Support Velkoz will more than likely cease to be a thing**_? Sorry support Velkoz mains, looks like you&#039;re up shit creek on this one. \r\n\r\nSo, let&#039;s get into the nitty gritty of WHY the changes are all around bad for Velkoz. \r\n\r\n- Velkoz numbers on his passive were nerfed per level and given an AP ratio. This may seem good for people that are thinking about building him straight AP but in actuality it&#039;s a huge nerf to what makes Velkoz good. Because most of his damage came from LEVELS which increased his passive damage, he now gets most of his damage from AP scaling off his passive. This means he&#039;s doing LESS damage in the early game so his kill potential has gotten much lower, as AP will be more scarce in the early game. Support Velkoz was strong because he didn&#039;t really need to build heavy AP to do respectable damage because of the level scaling on his passive and it being flat true damage. He might not ever delete his target as a support but he always did respectable damage because of the passive, and this made him function pretty well as a support. And because he needs AP to do damage now, his kill potential has went significantly down in the early game meaning it&#039;s HARDER to get ahead to get that gold that he now needs to do damage to kill people that he would have had early game for free before. If he could still farm well this would be a non-issue but that brings me to my second point. \r\n\r\n- He lost a lot of the damage on his W. A LOT. This means Velkoz can no longer easily clear waves with W, and even if ahead, because a lot of his damage was relocated to his passive and requires AP to do damage, this means you have to use more than one W or W and then E on the wave to clear it, and often times that&#039;s not even enough. This means he can no longer play as safely in lane as he did before in bad matchups against champions like Zed, Yasuo and Leblanc. Velkoz CANNOT beat these characters in lane against an equally skilled opponent without being able to wave clear to get farm and build some defenses and many of his bad matchups probably got significantly worse because of this. This also dampens his ability to roam because it takes him longer to clear waves and thus he can&#039;t clear mid quickly and then gank a side line. This forces him to actively engage the opponent more and as an immobile poke mage that is not something he can safely do. \r\n\r\n- As if his laning phase being worse wasn&#039;t enough of a nerf, his team fighting ability got SIGNIFICANTLY worse because of the changes to his ult functionality. If you are unaware of how the changes work, his ult no longer stacks his passive. Most of the damage his ult did came from the massive amount of stacks it put on the enemy team in an AOE. The new ult mechanic requires you to land 3 hits of your normal abilities to get true damage. This ups the single target damage (if you can land the abilities, big if in team fights) and reduces the damage on anyone else. Because Velkoz is a squishy, immobile mage that must root himself to ult, this means he realistically cannot proc his passive on the back line in a team fight without putting himself at huge risk and must instead focus most of the damage on the front line. This means his squishy deleting power in team fights got significantly reduced and it also hurts his biggest strength which was his AOE true damage contribution to team fights. Additionally his ult lost some utility as a long range finisher that can be used by itself as it must be set up and is no longer a single, independently functioning ability and is more of a combo finisher and pushes him more in the direction of being a single target burst AP stacking mage. \r\n\r\n- An indirect nerf to Velkoz but most of the new items do not favor his kit as much as old athenes did and there is no longer a clear and effective build path for him. The change to athenes and morello means he will probably have to go to flat mana items and most of them don&#039;t favor his kit as much. Before he could focus on mana regen first and still do damage because of his passive but now he&#039;s going to have to build mana and delay building damage, and then go damage in a separate item after he has his mana problems taken care of, significantly delaying his power spike and pushing him more in a late game, heavy AP direction.\r\n\r\nIMO the strengths of Velkoz were his lack of reliance on AP, his wave clear, and his ability to build utility and lack of a need for massive amounts of gold to contribute to team fights. Riot has dismantled one of the most balanced champions in league for no real reason when the champion was already played very little and pushed him in a much worse direction. He wasn&#039;t seeing competitive play and was rarely picked in ranked, so I don&#039;t understand WHY they would dismantle him like that. It feels as if they want to pigeon hole him into a heavy AP build path and focus him more on the late game, when he was more well rounded across the whole game before. Very bad design decisions all around.","replies":[{"poster":"Requiemsfire","date":"2016-05-04T23:19:06.423+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"It seems they want him as some kind of combo mage tank melter.

The biggest is his ult's nerf. If you can't proc his passive, then you're pretty much useless; in a large teamfight, hitting your abilities to get the true damage is nigh impossible. Before, sure, it was annoying if the team had an annoying combo which rooted your team and then Velkoz came in and absolutely smashed you, but that was your fault for grouping and not having a way to eliminate the immobile mage.\n\nI'm with ya man.

This means it can be a great tool for gaining back mana by killing 3 minions (150% Refunded) if you prep the wave well. \n\n>**6.9 Patch Notes\n **\nPassive - Organic Deconstruction\nDAMAGE 35 - 205 (at levels 1-18) ⇒ 33 - 169 (at levels 1-18)\nNEWRATIO Now additionally scales with 0.4 ability power\n\nNote that the overall damage of his passive Increases assuming you obtain at least 100 AP by the time you're level 18. This allows you to play around with CDR Vel'Koz to apply more passive True Damage procs. \n\n> R - Life Form Disintegration Ray\n Deconstructed champions become Researched for the next 7 seconds (refreshed by basic attacks and abilities). Life Form Disintegration Ray deals true damage to Researched targets instead of magic damage.\n> STACKBOT No longer applies stacks of Organic Deconstruction\n> DAMAGE 500/700/900 ⇒ 500/725/950\n> RATIO 0.6 ability power ⇒ 1.0 ability power\n> COOLDOWN 130/110/90 seconds ⇒ 120/110/80 seconds\n\nSo the Buff to the Passive is great, and allowing targets to stay Researched for 7 seconds with any spell proc is great for poke situations. 45% CDR will allow you a ton of poke potential on multiple targets and allow you the ability to simply use your laser to poke people down and off objectives. \nYour Ultimate will drop from 80 Seconds to 44Seconds Cooldown at Level 16 and you'll be able to brute force your way to turrets and objectives very easily when well protected.\n\nYes his change hurt his burst combo and ability to overall shred a backline, but given the chance and when put with a decent composition I think Vel'Koz will have a great time to shine.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Niji","date":"2016-05-05T14:46:14.030+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hate the changes I liked going support rushing sightstone and stacking magic pen relying on my bases and passive for damage and this update ruined everything about that ty roit","replies":[]},{"poster":"Zavtastic","date":"2016-05-05T14:34:42.624+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Is it just me or was the change for the target indicator for the q only being visible by velkoz not implemented?
