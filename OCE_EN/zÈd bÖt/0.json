But Leaverban is **not** something you get from a **one off crash or bugsplat**, Riot are not evil corporate lords that smite down players for one off crashes, **if you leave or AFK in games consistently THEN you will be placed into low priority queue**. If your PC is crashing THAT consistently then you should probably invest in a new computer, or if it's a league of legends related problem (such as bugsplats, file errors, server problems and what not) then you can make a [support ticket here](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/requests/new).\n\nBut other than that there's nothing anyone can do, I suggest you just play **_co-op vs ai_** as they are the easiest to finish quickly so you can get rid of those queue timers faster. But I really suggest you find a fix to your computer problems before trying to fix your AFK/Leaver problems :( \n\nI hope you can sort these problems out summoner!\nGood luck.","replies":[{"poster":"ZÈD BÖT","date":"2018-10-08T22:49:08.235+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"i have go a new pc on the way right now ty for youre help my pc sucks and every few days i cant play league cuz it will crash alot","replies":[]}]}]}
