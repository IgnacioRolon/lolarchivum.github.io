Top is really REALLY fucking hard to hard carry games with.\nI got out of bronze by maining jungle. Mid/adc works too.\nThe problem with the current meta is that top isn't really a high impact role (in bronze at least).\nIf you want to stick with top though, a quick tip: save your tp's. (Using the first one or two to get back into lane is fine but other than that look to make plays in other parts of the map). Too many toplaners are off on their own little island, and that isn't how league works.\nIt's a team game.\nBest of luck on the rift.{{sticker:slayer-pantheon-thumbs}}","replies":[{"poster":"Pured","date":"2017-07-23T01:30:43.425+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I have to disagree. Top is the most broken lane. Jungle is a close second because you can gank, counter and use broken champions, but jungle is my second worst role. I main Support/Mid, but when I want to climb seriously, I try to get top over what I'm actually good at.\n\n@F33R, Just use a simple champion who becomes a monster and learn how to farm well enough to be able to not let the game go past 30 minutes.\nExamples would be Tryndamere, Darius, Garen, Vlad, etc... Then, just practice getting your last-hitting as close to perfect as you can. It probably sounds stupid, it did to me at the start, but the difference good cs makes is outstanding.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"LAKIGR","date":"2017-07-18T08:27:14.881+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Alright so by just look at your match history I can already tell you a couple of things to work on. Firstly cs, you are way below average for what you should be getting at least a 100 cs by 20 minutes at the bare minimum. You seem to average something like 50-60 cs at 20 minutes which is really bad.  Second stop playing xin top. He's pretty garbage as a top lane and just about everything is better than him.","replies":[]},{"poster":"TimingOfLords","date":"2017-07-20T06:24:24.967+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"I am definitely not biased or anything, but Heimerdinger is amazing. Especially in bronze. Very few people know how to play against him and even fewer have played him. He teaches you positioning and timing your skillshots. Not only that, but he is great for decision-making. I am a Heimerdinger main and (since his rework) have been climbing with ease. Obviously, bronze is difficult to climb out of unless you play champs that easily solo-carry games. You also need to improve macro play and have a decent understanding of all the champs in the game. Up until a few weeks ago, I had an 86% winrate in solo/duo queue. Although trolls and feeders ultimately lowered that winrate. I still maintain >50% winrate. Meaning that I am climbing.\n\nTL;DR Learn specific champs that teach you specific mechanics in the game. For example, Nasus for cs-ing, Heimerdinger for positioning, various junglers for macro play (generally tank junglers like Sejuani, Zac, Maokai, etc.), and improve your mechanical skill enough and you will climb.\n\nPlay Heimerdinger","replies":[]}]}
