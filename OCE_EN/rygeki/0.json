I&#039;m so sick of this Ranked system, and i&#039;m sick of having my time, effort and LP wasted because of having an AFK from 30 seconds into the game! (Which was our ADC) I can see why people decide to troll now, because 0 fucks are given about the players and the unfair games we consistently put up with. Especially when the AFK's/Trolls don't even get punished anyway! All they will cop is a measly time penalty before they queue up from LEAVERBUSTER. So tell me why should we have to lose our LP for such shitty reasons? Our team definitely deserved a loss prevention because we played much better than the enemy team despite such a huge DISADVANTAGE, and we even finished the game with a better kill count 58/42/101 to 42/58/71, yet we lose the game and our LP because we&#039;re outnumbered. Fix your System Riot, because this is one of the main reasons this game has such a bad community. Sincerely every league player in the OCE region.","replies":[{"poster":"Kiribotz","date":"2015-10-09T01:19:29.922+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Riot thinks that a 4 v 5 game is fair. plain and simple they don't give a crap about the people who lose from AFK's the whole game.","replies":[]}]}
