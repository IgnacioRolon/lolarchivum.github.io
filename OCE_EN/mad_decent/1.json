Its happened before where when a server opened sometimes a previous skin was renamed in honor of the server so there wasn't a new skin. anyway, why do we need one? Outback renek is fine. One of the severs got anivia so we're not the short end of the stick at least. :)","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Chalze","date":"2015-03-17T03:08:30.179+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Supporting you now, it's been way too long","replies":[]},{"poster":"GoldenTomat0","date":"2015-03-17T04:40:05.593+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"ahahahahahahahahahah\nahahaha\nhahah\nha.\nwe're not. accept it.","replies":[{"poster":"Zero Infinity","date":"2015-03-17T05:25:21.908+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"What are you basing this on?\nRiot are so careful about what information they release; and they've said it's coming.\nSo unless there's an official word otherwise, why think different.\nAlso if they did take back their original word, we'd probably be compensated in some other way.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"GoldenTomat0","date":"2015-03-17T04:23:01.867+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"do you guys honestly believe we're getting one?","replies":[{"poster":"Zero Infinity","date":"2015-03-17T04:34:36.416+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"Yes.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"GoldenTomat0","date":"2015-03-17T05:49:31.928+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"what makes you think we are? riot have gone back on their word multiple times. still no replay system, still no effective method of stopping people from afking, still no OCE skin after 20 odd months.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Garens Harem","date":"2015-09-30T11:03:09.641+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"skin doesn't even symbolise oce in anyway lmao","replies":[]},{"poster":"Garens Harem","date":"2015-09-30T11:01:17.095+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"ARE YOU NOW SATISFIED","replies":[]},{"poster":"sparklefart","date":"2015-03-17T22:25:49.231+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Bogan Gragas confirmed","replies":[{"poster":"Garens Harem","date":"2015-03-18T06:35:35.695+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=sparklefart,realm=OCE,application-id=Ntey9fRZ,discussion-id=0n7XMVU1,comment-id=000b,timestamp=2015-03-17T22:25:49.231+0000)\n>\n> Bogan Gragas confirmed\n\nyis pls \n\nor unilad gragas","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Schakle","date":"2015-03-17T05:52:47.613+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Honestly.
