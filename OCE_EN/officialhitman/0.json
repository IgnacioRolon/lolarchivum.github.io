I don&#039;t want ranged champs due to my poor ability to play them. So if you guys recommend someone else, ranged is not my go to champs. I play assassins like talon or yasuo(apparently riot confirmed this. Source: Mid or AFK). And other melee champs . At my level ip takes 4ever to earn so leave ur suggestions and opinions below.
