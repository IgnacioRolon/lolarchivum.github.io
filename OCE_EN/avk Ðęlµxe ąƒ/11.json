As I threw money at my screen, I realised I could only gift him the standard skin package... which meant... I now have a lot of RP on my account.\r\nI think you should make Bundles giftable.\r\n\r\nNot only will you make more money, {{sticker:slayer-jinx-wink}} \r\nbut also... people like me who want to surprise the people they love can do that with bundles too.\r\nBundles are very very cool. I really like the bundles, and infact sometimes, I&#039;ll save up money just to buy one of the current bundles for myself.\r\n\r\nSo... how about it?\r\nLet&#039;s get Bundles into the Gifting section.\r\n\r\nThanks very much,\r\nx","replies":[{"poster":"Talon12","date":"2016-12-02T12:09:13.262+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"coulda given them $40 and saved yourself the problem.","replies":[{"poster":"AvK Ðęlµxe ąƒ","date":"2016-12-04T11:02:27.038+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Nah I just Gifted him Fiddy of RP... but still...
