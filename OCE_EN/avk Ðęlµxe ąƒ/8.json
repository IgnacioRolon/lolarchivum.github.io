But I need to know if it&#039;s worth it. Interpreters are quite expensive on an hourly rate, and although I may be able to get graduate students to do it, I&#039;m unsure if that could even work. Maybe it could be done with a re-screening of the Finals, but I would ultimately like to do it Live on the day to capture the full excitement and awesome times these events creates.\r\nHow many of you Esport fans in Australia are out there that would benefit from this?\r\nOr do you have friends or family that would be?\r\n\r\nThanks for reading!\r\n\r\n_- Deaf Summoners Club_","replies":[]}
