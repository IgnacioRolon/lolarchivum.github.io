Amazing job making the missions so stupidly hard to do in a random queue. \r\nPlease next time can you implement actual queues for missions that have such specific requirements, creating such troll incidents. I&#039;ve spent too many hours trying to find a random team that actually agrees on a queue... and that makes me not even want to play this game at all in the end.\r\nIt&#039;s a recurring discussion amongst others, not just me.\r\n &macr;\\_(ツ)_/&macr;","replies":[]}
