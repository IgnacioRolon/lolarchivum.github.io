But essentially, I'm always holding down the space bar.\r\nSo if i use abilities very quickly, it seems to lock up on me, and i cant do anything for like 2 seconds, this includes moving my mouse, which does move, but in a terribly laggy way.\r\nHas anyone found this?\r\nI tried turning on filter keys to mess around with repeated strokes... this did not work.\r\nDoes anyone know how I can fix this, as I cant play this game with constant 2 seconds laggy bits, because my keyboard is being a dick.\r\nMeanwhile, the old Microsoft Membrane keyboard from 1992 works freaking fine... apart from missing most of the keys...\r\nWTF.

But a definite solution for you to try is to uninstall your mouse drivers, forcing Windows to use the generic driver (I presume you're Windows because of the Microsoft Membrane Keyboard). That's if you're okay with uninstalling the drivers, though.\n\nIf you don't want to, reply to this message saying that.\n\nBest of luck.","replies":[{"poster":"AvK Ðęlµxe ąƒ","date":"2015-02-05T07:11:38.141+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thanks Horse of Force, I will try that... I'm using a Razer Naga mouse... So I should uninstall this mouse driver?","replies":[{"poster":"HORSE OF FORCE","date":"2015-02-05T07:29:29.630+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yes. Of course, have the installer for that driver handy,\n\nwait\n\nYou have a Logitech Keyboard and a Razor Mouse. That right there might be your problem. I know that Logitech's drivers will install and try to discover any other Logitech devices you have connected aside from the one you installed the software for and try to take control of it. It might be taking control of your Razor mouse, hence the disastrous effects, because it's not Logitech.\n\nJust a theory, though.\n\nAnyway, uninstall the softwares you installed when you first got your mouse. Unless, did Windows install the drivers automatically for you?","replies":[{"poster":"AvK Ðęlµxe ąƒ","date":"2015-02-10T21:41:21.130+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"This has definitely worked much better.
