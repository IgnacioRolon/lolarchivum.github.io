And this champ needs to collect stacks over the map, each stack giving more % to hit the deep gash caused by the bigger knife. Make the stacks stitches and make the champ scarred all over on appearance. Also to cut down on his OPness or her. You could say if a spell shield or something blocks the Big knife spell you cut yourself in the process of throwing it and need to collect 2 stacks of stitches to patch yourself up and to be able to use it again. I literally had a dream about this champ playing against me and this is where the idea came from.","replies":[{"poster":"Talon12","date":"2017-04-23T00:00:50.516+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Right...
