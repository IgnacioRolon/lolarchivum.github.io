I stopped playing ranked because i got tired of the dynamic queue system ( which i seriously think needs to have some tweaks for solo players). After about 25 days i played a ranked game and when previously i was getting about +18 lp and losing 10, now im gaining +10 or less and losing 20 lp a game. I would like to know the reason for this if possible. Thanks.","replies":[]}
