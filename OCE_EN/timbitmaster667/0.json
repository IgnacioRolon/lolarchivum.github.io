That way it would make it very hard for people to play champions they don&#039;t know how to play on ranked  you should have at least 6 champions above that mastery score to even play ranked at all. \r\n\r\nI take this game very seriously, i just want the people i play with in ranked  to also to take it seriously.","replies":[{"poster":"Struggle","date":"2017-01-01T21:50:43.877+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Mastery doesn't = competency.

I dont think in ranked play you should have to put up with players first timing champs they've never played.","replies":[]},{"poster":"dragon poo","date":"2017-01-03T06:36:03.519+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Father Time,realm=OCE,application-id=FjGAIbRv,discussion-id=gXXJbLMq,comment-id=0000,timestamp=2017-01-01T21:50:43.877+0000)\n>\n> Mastery doesn&#x27;t = competency.

However there might be a few things that you want to keep in mind. \n\nCurrently with the way ranked works there are five picks of champions from your team, 5 from the enemy team and 6 bans in total. With that mind there are a total of 16 bans every champion select rotation, its the reason why that before you play draft mode you need to have at least 16 champions unlocked or in the case of normal drafts 6 champions unlocked + 10 champions on free to play. This to ensure that players always have a champion they can pick, in the case of all 15 others getting taken away either by being picked or banned.\n\nWith that in mind you would have to then have 16 champions that you not only owned, but had over level four mastery on which can take some time to get when you are playing champions. Riot has done a lot of research into when players should be able to start playing ranked after hitting level 30 and getting the champions that they need, so by introducing this system for a lot of players this would mean that they would have to wait longer until they could play ranked, which could either be a good thing or a bad thing I am unsure to be honest. I can imagine a lot of players getting frustrated and impatient and I can imagine others not minding taking the time to prepare for ranked by building their champion pool a bit.\n\n--\n\nThe other thing to keep in mind is that when a new champion comes out a lot of players will want to play them. In this case this could be a good thing, this keeps people away from playing new champions that just came out in ranked, possibly not knowing what they are doing. However there is also the counter argument that ranked is the best place to learn as you will be vsing players from around your skill level. Along with this, this would mean that pro players in a sense would be forced to play normals (a less competitive mode) for however many games, fighting for the champion they want in blind pick to in a sense \"unlock\" the champion at level four mastery to be able to play them in ranked and learn them against players of their skill level.\n\n--\n\nWhat are your thoughts on the points I have brought up? I think that the idea you have brings up some interesting points and has its advantages and disadvantages. I am interested to hear what other people's thoughts on it are as well.\n\nGood luck in your ranked climb as well by the way, hope it goes well, keep playing and improving and you will reach your ranked goal.\n\n~Elam","replies":[]}]}
