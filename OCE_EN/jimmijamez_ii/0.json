If something is wrong you should always speak up, always have your own back, and something should be done.\n\nThis has nothing to do with gender, what does being female or male even have anything to do with their comment? \n\nNor is being civil, or at least trying to be so, the same as not speaking up and making boundaries clear. Civility has its own brand of power, that's just as effective if not more so than the \"gut\" responses.\n\nDrilling senses into someone's faces physically is usually the last resort, it's not something you do as the opener. Ignoring is good depending on the situation. \n\nIRL, if there is a mad person who comes out barking at you senselessly, there are usually 3 ways about it:\n\n1. You punch/kick them out. That's effective in getting them out of the picture, but that also only means underneath you really aren't that much better. It's also even worse if you only punch them out because of a bad day, as that only means you guys are the same kind of people.\n2. You give them a warning, before punching them out if there are further offences. This one is a more favourable way to punch someone out, because you made the line clear beforehand. Though one thing to note is that it can also be used to threaten and silence someone unjustly thanks to jungle rules, so use it wisely.\n3. Or you can just ignore them. To some you may appear that like wuss, but the reality is that there is really no reason to go apeshit over someone's void attempts at trying to get your attention by attacking you personally through words. And in not giving a fuck, you've won the encounter, smoothly, just like that and all they could do is trying their shit over and over until they hopefully realise they're a big damning moron.\n\nI personally prefer #3 and #2. They are what I generally promote.\n\nThe only exception is when the said attack is not directed at you specifically, but at someone or something else you hold dear, especially when they are not present or can not respond/fight back in their own way, then that's a different story; kick down their table or punch them out for all I care, but mind the others.\n\n...............\n\nBut really, when it comes to internet verbal abuses, since you can't warp yourself to the verbal attackers' home to punch them or pull of any of the stuff that work in real life regardless of how dipshit the troll is acting, obviously the best way to go about it is just telling them that they fk up, report and/or mute them or something. It's much easier said than done, absolutely, however that still doesn't change the fact that throwing yourself into the middle of the typing heat is not going to do you good.","replies":[{"poster":"mau5trap","date":"2017-02-18T10:45:49.094+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"1, gender has a lot to do with the way majority will deal with an issue, fact. female tend to shy away from confrontation (majority not all) and from the way the response was written, safe to say.\n\n2, it is obvious the type of person (and yes I can and will use \"type\" in this instance) this is that is abusing the author of this post.

Girls fighting with or even bulling other people and/or their partner/spouse, and the victim being unable to voice for as well as to find help, is just as prevalent/severe as the male counterpart, and similarly for all of the other similar scenarios; so there is in reality no such thing as \"female tend to shy away from confrontation\". The only difference is how the confrontation/oppression is achieved which may differ between genders, and the receiving end of the confrontation or victims of such oppression may have different fundamental reasons for why they will or won't speak up depending on their gender thanks to traditional values, but it's never concrete, and that's really it.\n\n> 2, it is obvious the type of person (and yes I can and will use &quot;type&quot; in this instance) this is that is abusing the author of this post.

There are either 6 or 10 people in a match. Do your issues with whoever that has an issue with you come before the other 4 or 8 people's fun in a match ? Also, doesn't flames and overreaction precisely what flamers want? Why are you giving them what they want?\n\n> 3, For sure you warn someone before if they don&#x27;t stop it they&#x27;ll cop it, depending on what you know/have learnt it is illegal not to.\n> \n> 4, To deal with a dog you must be a bigger dog with a bigger bark or have more dogs barking to get that dog to back down, if you catch my drift. Not all of us are as civilized or emotionally intelligent as others. In fact our race is pretty far behind where we should be.\n\nMore often than not, there is only 1 dog. And dealing with 1 dog is incredibly easy (assuming no rabies or something like that, but this is excluded from this analogy due to irrelevancy as toxicity is not a disease but a choice). You don't have to be a man on the floor barking at the dog to get them away, you just need to demonstrate that they are no match against you and they will back down on their own; I mean hell, you can practically use anything to scare a dog away as long as the said anything can be used to produce sounds and impact of some sort unless you're cornered by something like 10 to 1 ratio (gangbanged by premades for example) or something than you would need a much bigger impression. \n\nOr you could just you know, don't care? I mean what do you get from fighting a bunch of dogs that barked at you? Meat? Satisfaction? Protecting your ego? I mean seriously, what's the point? If they bark at you, so be it, tell them to fk off and be on your way, what's the big deal? As mention before, why are you feeding the trolls with precisely what they want as a means of your combat against them? How is that even going to work? Well it isn't.\n\nYou don't have to go with the flamers way to deal with them, because you don't.\n\nNot to mention, what's that last bit supposed to mean, because there are silly people so we should all be silly too? No it doesn't work like that. It's not about who beats who or who can be the bigger dog, it's about who does it right and better. Civility and emotional intelligence make you think better, and make you handle things better.\n\n> 5, When riots only support is &quot;submit a report&quot; and well we all know how sht that system is. it ends up banning those that get verbal in defense gj, or even not in defense but because you completely irritate people with that horrid match making system. The only options are to express your anger and frustration or delete the game and play something else, which if we all did that, well, there wouldn&#x27;t be enough people to have any balance (pfft) matches now would there? \n\nDefence and retaliation are 2 different things.\n\nIn the physical world, retaliation is a part of the defence, assuming you didn't overkill the attacker generally it will be either outright pardoned or having the punishment severely reduced if the attacker happens to die during their assault from the victim's self-defending actions.\n\nBut in a purely verbal environment, unlike in the realm of physical danger, attacking others can NOT function as a part of a defence mechanism, because no one is at the danger of dying for not doing their best to survive the attack. Thus retaliation is rightfully out-ruled as another attack, and that the victim is probably just using their opportunity to assert aggression and nothing else. Remember once more, defending yourself is not the same as attacking the attacker. If someone tells you that you should kill yourself and you respond with a \"fk you\", it's a self defence and it's rarely if ever punished by Riot. If someone tells you the same shit that you should kill yourself and you respond saying that you will kill their family instead, it qualifies as a retaliation.\n\n\"Two wrongs don't make one right\", is a phrase often coined by Riot, and they are correct in this regard. In the physical realm, practicality takes higher priority, and thus since the defender can not realistically be expected to protect themselves from physical harm while also minding the attacker, retaliation is allowed. But in the virtual realm where words are the only source of contact, then principles take the higher priority, and yes, two wrongs don't make one right. Your are allowed to deflect, deflate, reflect, ignore and ridicule the attacker for their verbal abuse as a form of defence, but you are not allowed and granted special privilege momentarily to attack and berate the attacker just because they started the flame on you, it's rationally nonsensical.\n\nYou also much like earlier, function a bit too much on presumptions. The system is not shit, at least not the majority of its existence, nor does it often target the defender, but only does so when the defender is BOTH reported AND found to be overboard with their defending that have wandered into attacking territory instead of simple defence. Atk-initiator will also be punished, if reported.\n\n.........................\n\nYou also more or less claim that the matchmaking system is to be blame for the toxicity that supposedly \"irritate\" people as opposed to people actively choosing to be toxic in the game. You also ignored the fact that the various \"irritation\" do in fact, NOT come from the matchmaking itself but from many other reasons such as:\n\n* In lower elo, smart plays naturally do not work because everyone is uncoordinated making brute-forcing/carrying the matches the only guarantee to actually climb the ranks which has both nothing to do with matchmaking and has everything to do with the pitfall of team based games in low tier plays.\n* And because everyone wants to carry their games, everyone further refuses to coordinate becausethey either know or assume that there will be no one there to capitalise on their teamplay.\n* And because people refuse to coordinate with each other in lower elos, they perceive teammates not as teammates, but as burdens and wildcards. And gets annoyed when they don't perform perfectly as they've demanded. Now imagine at least 8 players out of 10 are like that in every single SR match in low elo.\n* The blaming of \"matchmaking and my teammates\" begins. And you know the rest.\n\nHow much of that is the result of matchmaking? I would say pretty close to none. Because all of it is strictly born from the very nature of low elo as opposed to LoL's matchmaking itself.\n\nI mean, the only 2 points of argument with matchmaking:\n\n* Pairing people from different divisions and sometimes from adjacent leagues into a match. But then again, if we get into both MMR and how the system works, it's really not such a shocker why such phenomenon appears, nor is it really that much of a big deal in the end of the day. Matchmaking forms teams based on TEAM TOTAL MMR, because it's only logical to assume so, and MMR is not the same as leagues and divisions. Not to mention given how many division there are and how the vast majority of people in this game are in Bronze to Gold alone, all lower elo players share roughly similar MMR to begin with, regardless of their division. So ranks and divisions of your teammates are really not much of a factor. \n* Autofill. It sucks, but totally understandable as well as not un-manageable.\n\nWhat's a factor is that people often tilt themselves over little things like that as well as failing to understand the nature of lower elo. And proceed to blame the system for ","replies":[]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"grug","date":"2017-02-12T09:08:38.579+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"sounds like the typical oce game,","replies":[]},{"poster":"Call Me Clouds","date":"2017-02-14T10:49:29.535+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"that guy sounds pretty cool, its a good thing riot wont ban him because then they will lose money A++ rito","replies":[]},{"poster":"CapKebab","date":"2017-02-13T14:33:15.745+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I've seen players not as bad but similar to this guy that you're mentioning.\n\nDo you know why this guy was targeting you by chance?","replies":[]},{"poster":"Corvo Attano","date":"2017-02-12T07:05:02.929+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"JimmiJamez II: did u forget your meds\n\nOh shit you got him fam\n\nAlso physical violence?","replies":[]}]}
