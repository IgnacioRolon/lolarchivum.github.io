He plays brand support most of his games and around half way through laning phase if any lane is losing he will be toxic and end up going to their lane and trolling them trying to take exp and cs. I just played a game with him now and its exactly what he did, I can save clip from the replay and upload it if you would like because hes ruining so many games for competitive players trying to climb.\n\nRegards - BarnDog","replies":[{"poster":"DarkShade918","date":"2019-07-22T07:23:57.372+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"I can't wait to see [Name Removed]\n\nDon't name and shame, the mods don't like it\n\nIf you wanna submit a report, either\n\n1.
