I then looked them up on op.gg to see what his/her past games were like and around 70% of her past 20 games are her completely intentionally feeding and ruining the game for his/her team. I have linked their op.gg for you to have a look yourself if you want and if someone of power reads this please ban them, 10s, maybes even 100s of players games are being ruined by players like this and they just need to be removed from the community.\r\n\r\nThanks for reading \r\nSincerely barndog_ :)","replies":[{"poster":"Broken Scripts","date":"2019-03-30T10:22:13.972+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Average OCE plat game.","replies":[{"poster":"Exarch Leona","date":"2019-04-09T12:54:30.832+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Average OCE game*","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"DarkShade918","date":"2019-03-30T07:34:12.075+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I love {REMOVED}, He's the best player out there","replies":[{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2019-03-30T13:43:40.209+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Much like Florida man really.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Slowdownn","date":"2019-03-30T00:02:18.253+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Interestingly, That guy still has a 53% win rate and it's higher then yours!
