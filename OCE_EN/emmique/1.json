I don't have the fastest of internet speeds so I more or less have to leave it on overnight as it takes hours.\r\n\r\nBut I had the launcher saying that it needed to download ~2.2GB so I left it on, then checked it this morning and it had about 500MB left to download but the download speed was stuck at 0kbps. Left it for about an hour came back still same thing. So tried looking around for some solutions, added everything to the firewall whitelist and one was copy the S_OK file even though it already existed in the folders to copy it to.\r\n\r\nSo after trying all that and leaving it for another half hour it still wasn't going anywhere, so I decided to close and re-open it.\r\n\r\nNow it wants to re-download the 2.2GB???\r\nI'm sorry but- wtf? It just downloaded it, shouldn't it catch up to where it was? Or is there any way I can make it do so? Because I've only got 30GB of internet a month before it gets shaped and I don't plan on wasting around 5GB if this wants to re-download stuff >_>\r\n\r\nAny help would be very welcome.\r\nRegards,\r\nEmmique","replies":[{"poster":"HORSE OF FORCE","date":"2015-02-01T05:10:07.987+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The way League works, when it's downloading files, it saves them as unreadable temporary documents, which are to be deleted if the patcher process is stopped. Probably the stupidest use of computer resources, but hey, what am I to say how hard it is to code stuff like this?\n\nAnyway, I came across this problem once too. Something to do with finding the incorrect name for switching between different machines on the server end. A solution I found was to disconnect your computer from the internet once it reaches the point where it goes to 0kbps, and then reconnect it. After a few minutes of derping it should start downloading again.\n\nBest of luck.","replies":[{"poster":"Emmique","date":"2015-02-01T05:12:10.091+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Oh god so that means I do need to re-download everything doesn't it ? :l\nOr would trying to get a copy off a friend and then moving files into the folder work?\n\nIf not and it gets to downloading I'll keep the disconnecting/reconnecting in mind.\nCheers","replies":[{"poster":"HORSE OF FORCE","date":"2015-02-01T06:01:56.040+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Getting a copy from a friend should work.
