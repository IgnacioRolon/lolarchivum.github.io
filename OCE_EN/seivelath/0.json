It&#039;s been another six to seven months now, and we haven&#039;t really heard much information on the subject sense.\r\n\r\nPersonally, I&#039;d love to see these touches come to SR, as I feel that it really adds character to champions, and I feel that it would be interesting, even if a little bit that the shopkeepers. We&#039;ve seen that nice touch come from quite a few skins that have come out recently, as well as even champions now.\r\n\r\nThe preseason is nearly upon us once again, and with all the voice work been done with new skins and champions recently, it certainly isn&#039;t impossible. Do we as a community want to see this be included, or do we want to see Riot put resources into other areas and projects? Is it possible we could get an ETA, or even a confirmation that this is still going ahead?","replies":[{"poster":"DragonOfTheVoid","date":"2015-09-30T08:23:33.030+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I wont the replay system out in 7820","replies":[]}]}
