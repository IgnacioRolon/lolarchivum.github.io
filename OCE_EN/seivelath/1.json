I get past the patcher, and into the login screen, but when I put in my credentials, I end up getting stuck on the \"Login Status: Logging in\" window, before league notifies me that my connection has been lost. I have done the following to attempt to fix the issue, but none of them fixed it.\r\n- Repair\r\n- Fresh Installation\r\n- Turned off All Firewalls\r\n- Closed all other programs\r\n- Followed all instructions on the support page\r\n- Uninstalled all unnecessary programs as well as all programs that could potentially interfere with league\r\nNone of this has worked, if I could have a solution, I would be ever so grateful.\r\n\r\nThank you\r\n~ SoulsAnnihaltion","replies":[{"poster":"HORSE OF FORCE","date":"2015-02-28T09:39:40.703+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Have you tried [using Google's DNS](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues#wq4)?","replies":[]}]}
