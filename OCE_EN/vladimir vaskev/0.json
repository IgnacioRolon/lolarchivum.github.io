As a suggestion, why not make normals elo match ranked? Of course, normals would never affect your ranked elo, but maybe it should mirror it. This way I can practice against similar people to ranked","replies":[{"poster":"Saldean","date":"2015-04-08T13:55:15.421+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"From memory I remembered that there used to be normal draft pick in summers rift game mode but it must have been taken away? correct me if I'm wrong on that though. For different elo in normal queue it depends on the time zone that players play in and don't forget that you might be matched up with premade's as well.","replies":[]},{"poster":"ibohydrates","date":"2015-04-08T06:15:21.215+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"I think the logic behind the separate MMR between ranked and normals is because some people play normals with higher or lower elo friends frequently. \n\nIm Bronze 1, but regularly play normals with plats and diamonds while playing with friends so my normal MMR is much higher than my ranked MMR.","replies":[{"poster":"Vladimir Vaskev","date":"2015-04-09T11:09:12.571+0000","up_votes":0,"down_votes":0,"body":"Partying with friends will balance the mmr and match you with other parties. This way teams have the same team mmr and number of people partied. However, this doesn't affect an individuals mmr, perhaps a better reason behind the seperate mmr is that people tend to play roles and champions they are not used to, making them \"worse players\". \nEven then, surely practicing against the same level of play as your ranked games would give you a better idea of when you are ready to play a new champion in ranked.\n\nSaldean, yes, normal draft pick was a separate mode, but I don't think it was popular enough to keep queue times down in Oceania, so it never came to this region. Just like dominion (I think). However, from what I remember it too had a separate mmr and although some people claimed that it was there to practice ranked, my experience was that it was a heaven for negative attitudes and poor behavior. \n\nI'm disappointed that noone has really addressed my concern. Maybe the mentality that Riot has taken is that Ranked should be a place to practice, and if you are losing games with a new champion your rank will reflect that. This mentality is hardly productive as it discourages playing new champions against players who are normally of equal skill.","replies":[]}]}]}
