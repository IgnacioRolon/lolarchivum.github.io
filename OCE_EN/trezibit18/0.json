Some people dont play ranked they still shouldnt have to endure people like you in their games. ALso you went 0-9-0 three days ago and built 4 swifties.... Maybe take this ban as a wake up call","replies":[{"poster":"Essembie","date":"2017-03-19T21:27:19.783+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"This.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2017-03-19T12:09:17.878+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Intentional feeding will skip you straight to a 14 day ban, since obviously a chat restriction would do nothing for in game behaviour such as this. It;s worth noting that the step after 14 day is permanent, so I'd recommend keeping that in mind. Intent feeding is never ok, even if you have a bad team.","replies":[{"poster":"Bright Dusty","date":"2017-03-19T15:52:04.811+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I've had a 10 game chat restriction and another 2 week ban after my initial 2week ban. Why do you say that after a 2 week ban is perma ban which isn't the case?  Also what do you think of the rioter im the tainted minds fiasco?","replies":[{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2017-03-19T17:16:56.689+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"There are exceptions of course, the automated system will take you through the four steps (10 game chat rest., 25 game, 14 day ban, perma), though it also has the power to escalate severe behaviour. However sometimes upon manual review of a case it is deemed that a perma is not appropriate, and rather the agent handling the case will give another chance in the form of a 14 day ban.\n\nthe tl;dr of that is that usually if you receive a second of any ban it's because of a manual review, and being on that 14 day still leaves you one step away from perma (you just might be lucky enough to take only a half step for example).\n\nAs for your second question, I don't really follow the esports scene as all, so all I know is alittle about what happened with Chiefs and that a bunch of stuff is going down in the OCE pro scene atm, but if there was something specific you wanted me to look at, feel free to chuck us a link.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Arkangyle","date":"2017-03-19T06:34:01.816+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"You intentionally fed.
