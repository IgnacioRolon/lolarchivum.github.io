Firstly it's the same community, so there's going to be no change in circlejerking. Secondly, there's no karma or reddit gold to encourage circlejerking.\n\nI personally don't like the colour scheme of it. it's very bland, and there are only like 4 different colours being used, and they're all very similar, very gloomy colours.\nAnd the fact that you can only attach 1 image at a time in a post is pretty bs. It does make up for it with embedding photos from other sites though. that is a very good addition. So is the champion, summoner spell, and item icons.\n\ntl;dr it looks like %%%% but it has a lot of beneficial features.","replies":[{"poster":"Jack","date":"2014-11-26T00:50:49.128+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":3,"body":"That was basically my thoughts on this, I wish that those who've left or are deciding to leave will change their minds and just use it for what it is.","replies":[{"poster":"Darth Váper","date":"2014-11-26T01:58:44.374+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"> That was basically my thoughts on this, I wish that those who've left or are deciding to leave will change their minds and just use it for what it is.\n\nIf they change the color scheme, give us an actual GD instead of miscellaneous then more people would stay, also the layout is bad, like really bad.\n\nLove doin this tho\n\n{{champion:107}} ","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Rav","date":"2014-11-26T01:51:47.371+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"*Insert dull pun*\n\nEdit: Wow guys thanks for the gold!!!11!

You have to scroll down in that case.\n\nLike we don't really need an artificial attention meter to determine whether a post should stay at the top, GD originally had it right, popular posts will attract attentions because it is the post that constantly get replies, not the one which constantly get upvotes. **They are having the definition of popularity backwards in this case which is just wrong.**\n\nAnd idk what's with the backwards chronological order on things.\n\nIn short I personally don't enjoy Board much.","replies":[]},{"poster":"DianasGotSwag","date":"2014-11-27T01:38:22.164+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"You all realise you can make it show \"new\" content right?
