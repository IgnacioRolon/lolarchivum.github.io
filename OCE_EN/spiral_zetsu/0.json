He'd have to be insanely fed to win this trade because if he doesn't kill anyone he's just going to die immediately after because he literally just burned all of his abilities and is now basically got one option left.\n\nZed does definitely deal more initial damage than Aurelion but the total damage output of Aurelion's far exceeds Zed's during team fights and skirmishes, not to mention the raw utility Aurelion provides to his own team through initiation, zone control, and powerful crowd control. ","replies":[{"poster":"Nikolai12000","date":"2016-12-01T16:52:41.572+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Im currently bouncing around high diamond (D3-D1) on EUW and i have a lot of experience playing both as Zed, and against Zed as i main midlane, so here is my input:\n\n1 -  Zed's E dmg doesnt stack and it doesnt do a whole lot of dmg either. A Zed with 250 AD would deal 300 dmg with his E, which has a fairly small radius, simply avoid his shadows.\n\n2 -  His Q deals reduced dmg when he hits a person multiple times AND when it goes through multiple targets. It deals 75% dmg if you get hit by a second Q and 60% dmg after it has hit its first target. If you are standing back its unlikely you will get hit by more than 1 Q, and it probably passed through your teamates. Either he caught you off guard or you overstepped, otherwise there is no way he can get to you without having to use his W as a gapcloser. His Q with 100% dmg deals 360 dmg with 250 AD. So if the Q doesnt hit anyone first, the the E and Q combined will hit you for 660 in the midgame, and this is without counting resists.\n\n3 - While Zed does have aoe its very little compared to most other champions, even assassins. KhaZix often builds hydra and has his W+E for aoe dmg, Talon has a ton of aoe in his kit. Le Blanc has a lot of aoe burst, even new Rengar deals aoe with his hardest hitting spell.\n\nI get that Zed can be frustrating to play against as he is a strong laner (which is where he is supposed to shine) but he does have his weaknesses, and if he jumps into the entire team like some people here have suggested he will get oneshot if the enemy team have just the smallest clue as how to play against him. I think the main reason for the Zed complaints is due to him having been OP some patches ago. The duskblade synergy is no longer there and he even got nerfed due to the synergy, which hasnt been reverted. He is also sitting on a 48% winrate. Learn to play against him instead of complaining on the boards.","replies":[{"poster":"Requiemsfire","date":"2016-12-01T17:23:35.333+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thank you for clarifying what I was trying to say, I wasn't too sure on the exact numbers on his entire combo, I did neglect to mention his E doesn't deal anymore damage after the first instance. There's a lot of anti- AD assassin sentiment or assassin sentiment in general despite the fact that mages are the dominant champions of midlane due to their reliability to perform later on in the game and simply do more.\n\nI feel like his winrate dropped not just because duskblade nerfs but also buffs to {{item:3401}} {{item:3190}} and {{item:3107}}'s release which could be used to negate an assassins burst thus I don't think Zed himself needs a direct buff but that's just what I think.
