After I completed the 5 games, I got hit with another 5 immediately after. Then another 5 immediately after that. I don't leave games. The mac client is awful, so sometimes I dc at the start of a game and reconnect 2 minutes in, but I don't afk, or quit. I'm just stuck in the low-priority queue for apparently no reason.\r\nI like this game. I'd really like to be able to fucking play it.","replies":[]}
