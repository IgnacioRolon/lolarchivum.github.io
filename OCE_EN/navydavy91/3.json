Just then my league wouldn&#039;t let me click the ban button. I could select a champ but couldn&#039;t click ban. Ended up dodging because it wouldn&#039;t lock in. So i end up losing LP for something league did wrong. Anyone else think that we should just be able to choose a ban and not lock it in?","replies":[]}
