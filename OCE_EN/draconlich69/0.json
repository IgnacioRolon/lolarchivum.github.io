I play well most of the time and am just falling down the elo ladder back into the depths of hell. I was instantly demoted from gold 1 because I dodged 2 games (the lobby was held hostage in one and I had a janna jg in the other) then I lost the first game on 0 lp which had a midlaner who flamed and just died while my team tried their hardest to win fights. Fast forward to today I&#039;ve lost 6 games in a row, generally speaking I perform well and win lane or atleast if I don&#039;t win lane I&#039;m making picks and plays for other lanes with TP to get us a gold lead and objective control. However even if I perform well, doing the most dmg possible, landing everything and trying my damnedest to shot call and wrangle the wild beasts that I&#039;m supposed to call team mates they get mad and afk or int. Riot I don&#039;t know what I did to get matched with these people who apparently were plat 3 and above last season but now drag even a gold 2&#039;s game down but can you cut a guy some slack. I love playing league and I&#039;ve been playing for years but my goodness if I try so hard every game and get shot down it just hurts to play.\r\n\r\nTL:DR - I&#039;m losing too many games and I&#039;m crying about it, check my history I&#039;m just sad","replies":[{"poster":"Sulbatamol","date":"2018-03-10T21:25:20.200+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"This is because currently you are playing in border line. You must have encountered a lot of p5 p4 players. I know a lot of them are content with their rank even tho their mmr is garbage and they refuse to climb up. I played a couple of kids with 1900~ mmr range who are p3 p2 players and it was so thrilling to play with and to against. I remember playing in p5 is like i  play again in b5 division. Low plats are garbages, dont expect much from your teammates.","replies":[]},{"poster":"HEIPILAOGONG","date":"2018-03-07T08:27:51.230+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Heaps of bad players are in Diamond 5 also.

If you really care about climbing, pick a role, pick 3 champs, and stick to it. That way you can actually focus on winning games rather than playing your champion.","replies":[]}]}
