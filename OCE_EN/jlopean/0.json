Iv had times when my internet for reasons beyond my control just went down randomly. I did everything I could to fix it and it took me 4 months to finally get it resolved. I had probably dced from about 20 ranked games. Which may not seem like much but when you consider that iv lost 45 ranked games that makes up about half of my losses. \nIf the system you want was in place I would have lost a lot of my mmr for reason beyond my control. \n\nNot sure why your mentioning Starcraft has nothing to do with this. \n\nThe problem with your idea of being hindered by someone going afk is that it ther will always be games like that. There will always be games where someone trolls or plays like shit. And your basically playing 4v5 anyway. \n\nThere will always be games that are decided by 1 player. Iv lost games because my adc decided to face check the enemy side of the map at 50 minutes died and we lost both baron and elder drake. \n\nAll your describing is reality. It’s called life, shit happens, get over it. If I’m at my job and someone calls in sick and I have to pick up the extra work do I suddenly deserve to earn more money for that shift? \n\nRiots system is flawed and it will always be flawed there is no perfect system. \n\nAnd to match your quote \n“ A new authoritarian dogma does not triumph by convincing its opponents and making them see the light, but rather because its opponents are silenced through one means or another, and a new generation grows up being indoctrinated by the dogma.”","replies":[{"poster":"Transcender","date":"2018-10-19T01:44:14.509+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"First of all starcraft is the most ideal comparison because it uses a ranking system identical to the league of legends ranking system. Starcraft uses a system that was designed for the format that they use, league of legends has a different format, yet they are the exact same system. It is also a game focused around skill/strategy with a birds eye view of a battle ground upon which units are controlled and have certain abilities.\n\nWith your scenario, you chose to risk playing a game where the outcome will result in an increase of mmr or a decrease of mmr for your whole team. However you are claiming that the current system, which penalizes you sometimes because of reasons you did not check for or anticipate should be shared with others instead of accepting the full responsibility of the outcome that affected your team as well as yourself. For example, you said you dc'd in about 20 of the games you lost. Now I understand the first disconnect because you did not bother to ensure that your connection was going to be 100% stable for a game of league. No one, not even myself would bother checking to make sure their internet will definitely not disconnect, that is a risk that you take and you must still accept the responsibility for it, but then upon knowing that you had been having internet troubles recently, with a much higher increased chance of internet problems, you then chose to risk not only yourself, but the rank of those who you were put with.\n\nWhy must the 4 players vsing the 5 players have to suffer because of one. The only way for matchmaking to be good enough is for there to be a consistent and fair playing field for both sides. You cannot make up for an unfair game with another unfair game, because how many times will both teams have the same players on it 2 games in a row. On top of that the better team that might've won 2 out of the 2 games that were played, never even had the opportunity to play in a fair match against the opposing team who might've lost 2 out of the 2 games that were played. This results in there being a negative outcome because the players mmr would end up closer together instead of the them being further apart due to the potential fair outcome as opposed to the unfair outcomes that are meant to balance themselves out.\n\n\"There will always be games that are decided by 1 player. Iv lost games because my adc decided to face check the enemy side of the map at 50 minutes died and we lost both baron and elder drake.\"\n\nThere will never be any games that are decided by 1 player. Just because it was the last situation in which he made a mistake, does not make for for the hundreds of mistakes made by both teams in the entire game that led to the final conclusion. Imagine if you got massively fed and denied the enemy of most of the objectives and resources. You would have then been enough to counteract that one players mistake to change the conclusion. In a game of 5v5 where the game is designed for both teams to have an even chance of winning, no game can ever be decided by one player.\n\nWhat I am describing is \"reality\". If we simply close our minds and accept the current state of things, we will never adapt and progress. Everyone has the power to change what they do, making the same mistakes and throwing your hands in the air means you don't care about the outcome and therefore will keep making the same mistakes. Why do we need to just accept that we will make the same mistakes repeatedly when we ourselves could change it.\n\nIf your company is paying you to compensate for the jobs of others then you are already getting paid to do that job. If you are not getting paid to do a job then that is called volunteering. If a company requires work to be done, then they should be getting someone in to do it.\n\nIf I am correct in understanding the purpose behind that quote, it is pretty much just expanding in detail what the quote I posted is saying.","replies":[{"poster":"JLopean","date":"2019-01-28T21:00:54.753+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thanks, Transcender you got the point I was trying to make .. 5 v 5 matchup is fair and obviously 5 v 4 is not due to an afk. you should not be penalised (i.e. loss of LP)  when an unfair matchup occurs. seems like such a simple rule to introduce.. but thats just me","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]}
