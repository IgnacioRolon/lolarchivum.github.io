You try your best in a game, and someone rage quits or afks early. what does Riot do? They punish the entire team for the toxicity of 1 player  with the slap in the face for us to lose full quota of league point.s (LP)  lets just say this doesnt fill the community with a sense of fairness or with happiness. Why not have the afk person lose lp but the team doesnt. i dont mind that the winning team gets thefull winning  LP, but you can see what an easy fix this would be and how not everyone gets punished * so simple\n\n2. Riot does poorly at matchmaking. Im a silver player and i often get matchfixed with iron players with terrible winrates (low 30%). I dodge, because i actually want to climb or just have a good game. What does Riot do? they punish  the normal player just wanting to have a good game. Again fueling the toxic culture.

It mean your silver rank is low enough to be with those iron players. Or vice versa. \n\nAnd by toxic culture, what do you mean by it?
