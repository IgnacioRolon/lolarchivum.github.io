Linking my teamspeak was easy but to link my lol account it said I had to add &#039;VG SITE&#039; to my friends on LoL and message it. \r\n\r\nI tried adding &#039;VG SITE&#039; but it said the name was not found. What do I do now? Does VictoriousGaming not work in oce?","replies":[{"poster":"Wuks","date":"2015-11-28T00:17:17.442+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey Pandoria,\n\nAt this time, VictoriousGaming Tournaments are only held in the NA region. Sorry about that!","replies":[{"poster":"LemonsForDayz","date":"2015-11-28T00:42:11.182+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thank you for letting me know. I have more questions if you don't mind. I just made a tournament/community event. \nQuestions: \n1. How long does it take for a tournament to be approved?\n2. How come it only shows 2 tournaments on the community events home page. Surely there should be more?\n3. When making my tournament it won't seem to let me type in my email in the the place where it says I have to type my email. It's not needed it says but I still wanna know.\n\nThank you\n\nP.S. This is my smurf.","replies":[{"poster":"Wuks","date":"2015-11-30T06:10:22.215+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"1. I haven't actually set up a tournament myself yet; however, I'd put a rough guestimate of about three weeks to get it approved. \n2. It looks like only two tournaments are registered at this time. \n3. Your email attached to your League of Legends account will be used for registering the tournament. \n\nGood luck with the tournament!","replies":[]}]}]}]}
