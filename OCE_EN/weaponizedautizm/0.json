There&#039;s no way of manually adding someone to the block list. There is no option for this.\r\n\r\n2. List of &quot;Recently Played With&quot; players is listed in no discernible order. Neither chronological nor alphabetical. This list, along with the Block List, really needs to be in CHRONOLOGICAL order please with most recently played with or most recently added at the top. This list also seems incomplete. Often I have gone to this list to look for someone I just played a game with or against, and their name is not there.\r\n\r\n3. Inability to use double/triple-click to highlight text typed into the details part of the IFS, either for correction or copy/paste purposes. This means if you want to report premades or multiple people for the same offense each report needs to be individually written.\r\n\r\n4. Upon entering post-game lobby, the chat box text is always at the top of the text box. It does not automatically scroll to last line added. I&#039;m used to it now but was kinda disorientating to begin with.\r\n\r\n5. Unable to spectate the games of friends who are using Legacy client. The option is there but not clickable.\r\n\r\n6. Can&#039;t find Custom Item Sets anywhere? Maybe I just haven&#039;t found them yet? Sets, as they are, are still accessible ingame but if I want to add/change something I need to log into my Legacy client, change it there and then relog into Alpha.\r\n\r\n7. Unable to type into the chatbox in the Party Formation Screen.\r\n\r\n8. The Summoner Names in Champion Select Lobby don&#039;t stand out as much as they could. I find the Summoner names to be smaller and stand out way less than the names of the champions chosen. We have icons for the champs, their names don&#039;t need to be so bold or large that it makes the summoner names hard to find. If reading the chat (which only has Summoner names) and then wanting to correspond that to the role/champion selected of whoever said what, especially in consideration to role calling, it takes longer than it should and this has caused a few cock-ups in lobby so far for me. No, I don&#039;t use or need glasses lol\r\n\r\n9. The Champion voice volume in Champion select is in a world of it&#039;s own! Even with the game master volume turned down to 4% (so low I can&#039;t hear games pop) and the LoL Client volume on my PC turned down to an almost minimum via the mixer, the voices of the champs when you select them, or when they are banned or picked in ranked, it&#039;s so **LOUD**. They simply don&#039;t seem to be affected by a button, slider or dial anywhere. Is there a separate volume control for this I&#039;m missing?\r\n\r\nSome of these I have reported as bugs, while other just seem to be missing features that may not even end up in the final Client. If I find more things I&#039;ll add them too.\r\n\r\nGood things I have noticed though: \r\nThe last two patches using the Legacy Client, I have not be able to get a login screen to appear after hitting Launch unless I first shut down Razer Synapse. A lot irritating really. The Alpha client doesn&#039;t have that issue - yay! It&#039;s kind of funny how I can log into the Alpha right now and not have an issue, but logging in using the Legacy client and the client is like &#039;Nope, aint happenin&#039;  lol\r\nI also have left the Alpha client running on my PC for over 4 days straight, through long periods of idle time while I did other things, and while my PC and I both went to sleep lol and no disconnects from PvP.net like the Legacy client does :D Cool! A small thing really, but I like it.","replies":[{"poster":"UltraFireFX","date":"2016-10-19T04:17:59.635+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"5 is a confirmed bug and is getting fixed, 6 is not getting re-added because Riot said that few people actually used the feature and most people were fine with them not adding it as long as Riot continues to support third-party item-set software such as Championify (which they have said that they will).","replies":[{"poster":"WeaponizedAutizm","date":"2016-10-19T10:37:30.847+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'm guessing they are still available when playing because the game client is Legacy while the LoL Client is Alpha (or we'd only be able to pay with people using the Alpha) and the game is picking up on the original game config/json files. \n\nSo now I'm bothered because some of the game settings I have are changed outside of the ingame config GUI itself, and have been done via these config files inside the League of Legends config  folder as there's more options to change settings that way than via the game itself. I had the 'camera snap on respawn' and 'left click attack move' changed this way long before it was an option in the game itself. RIP my custom config files =( \n\nI love the Custom Item Sets and use it all the time as I primarily play one of two roles so my one 'set' covers pretty much everything I might need in any situation. I don't have to go hunting for what to buy or put up with the dinky \"recommended Items' which are bollocks.  Never heard of Championify, I'll look into it. Thanks.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"WeaponizedAutizm","date":"2016-10-18T17:59:24.596+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Can't minimise the Friends List.
