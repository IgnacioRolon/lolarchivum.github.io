Twisted Treeline has been my favourite game mode, especially now with this new and unstructured meta that has been introduced in to Summoners Rift. In it&#039;s current state, TT has the ability to flourish but it needs your help. The current Saturday/Sunday availability is extremely inconvenient and waiting 5 days to be able to play my favourite game mode is a bit of a down. Not to mention, after waiting those five days, I may not even get to enjoy TT due to other commitments.\r\n\r\nSo here is my proposal. Every weekend, open TT Flex from 11-11 which I believe would be an optimal time and allow the most amount of players to be online. Then for weekdays, open the queue from 530-1030 every day or second day, allowing all school students and 9-5 workers time to be able to get online. 1030 is a good cut off as a lot of people would be going to sleep ready for the next weekday at this point.\r\n\r\n#REVIVETT\r\n\r\nThank you,\r\nI Love Thresh.\r\n\r\n{{sticker:zombie-brand-mindblown}}","replies":[{"poster":"BarryButcher","date":"2018-07-28T06:41:26.468+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"They had it on more days at the end of last season t``o allow people to climb and get the ranked rewards. They decided to run a trial and keep the extra hours per week open at the start of this season but saw that people playing TT dramatically fell off and so went back to the weekend only model.\n\nSadly OCE is a tiny ass server and can barely maintain Flex and Solo Que let alone a 3rd ranked que.","replies":[]},{"poster":"TSM Swish","date":"2018-07-28T06:17:15.396+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Isn't it down to numbers of players online?
