I would like to find out if this is a bug or if it is intentional. I&#039;m not sure but could it be that \r\npromo helper doesn&#039;t give you a free win for going up divisions. Another thing is in the previous promo in one of my games\r\nwhile in lobby i lost internet which counted as a loss so that could also have affected it.","replies":[{"poster":"Blitzcranku","date":"2017-03-29T11:53:25.220+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Oh ok, Thanks for your comment.
