In a gaming community, this can be achieved by fostering an environment where the experienced mentor the inexperienced, and the successful pass on their learning to those wishing to take their gaming to the next level.\r\n\r\nAt Traction Gaming, we embody this philosophy. We are a network of brothers and sisters, united in our ambitions.\r\n\r\nBeyond bringing our fresh recruits up to speed, we also foster our love of gaming with a healthy dose of competition. That&rsquo;s right, we&rsquo;re talking about major tournaments in League of Legends, Dota 2 and Hearthstone &ndash; where the winners take home not just fame and glory, but real cash prizes as well. On top of that there will be fun competitions for anyone to enter. We will also be keeping you up-to-date with the latest and greatest in the gaming industry. If it&rsquo;s important to the gaming world, we will get it in your brain via our blogs and think-pieces.\r\n\r\nAnd though we are a new community, our leadership council have a storied past together and have long held to our beliefs. Over the years, we&rsquo;ve wondered how we could build a diverse community of gamers that all enjoy their passions under one banner&hellip; and we believe we have built the answer.\r\n\r\nSo we welcome you to an experience of growth, information sharing and development. Our team want to help you become a better gamer in every sense. A better player, a stronger competitor and a better influence on the community and industry as a whole. If you want to learn how to be a better gamer, you&rsquo;ve come to the right place. If you are already an experienced and comfortable gamer, then come join us, make some friends and become part of our future.\r\n\r\nWe&rsquo;re a force to be reckoned with and we can&rsquo;t wait to see what you have to offer.\r\n\r\n**As of this week we have officially started recruiting!
