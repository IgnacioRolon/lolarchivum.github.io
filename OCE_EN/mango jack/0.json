I 100% believe the approach should have been to give people the option to re-do there promos if they weren&#039;t happy with your old formula. My entire games thus far were against majority Gold and Platinum solo queue players and I still maintained a 60% win rate. I had to work hard in every game to ensure victory and how satisfying it was to play with and against players that actually knew what they were doing. Now I am back an entire tier from S3 where I was getting 27lp a win. To me this is massively unfair and I take it to heart as I was so happy to be placed in a decent starting position with a large LP gain.","replies":[{"poster":"ShapeSter","date":"2016-11-15T04:36:16.420+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Wow.

The matchmaking for placements originally was completely messed up, B5s getting placed in P1 and P1 gettign placed in B5. The change was intended to fix the ranking of those who got placed inaccurately (as typically you'd get placed a little lower than your end of season rank) and has certainly not quite worked as intended for some people, but your seeding at least appears to be fixed.\n\nI know it feels unfair, but the placements were unfair for everybody (good unfair or bad unfair), and leaving Diamonds in Bronze and Bronzes in Plat was only going to destroy flex matchmaking moreso.\n\nhttp://boards.oce.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/announcements/XMZm8OPI-ranked-corrections-to-placement-results-and-ranks","replies":[]}]}
