TG consists of active gamers which have a &quot;real life first&quot; mindset. We aim to satisfy our member&#039;s needs for team based gaming by having our Tactical Warfare franchise for warfare based games and our Tactical Sports franchise for sports based games.\r\n\r\nBasically the OCE side of the league of legends division is looking for some new players. Any rank, any level, anybody is welcome. We do 2 mandatory practices a week and in addition some get together for optional practices. If you are more looking for a ranked team you can still join and give some of our members a PM as I&#039;m sure they&#039;d be keen to start up a team. \r\n\r\nFor signing on there is an initial registration which takes about 2 min to do, then someone has to confirm it which may take up to 24 hours. After that there is a boot camp which involves a test. If anyone has problems with the test feel free to send me a pm on the sight and I am willing to help. After that you are assigned to a squad and then proceed to start your journey with TG.\r\n\r\nAny questions please try and refrain from adding me in game unless its important or you wish to disclose information.\r\nIn addition feel free to use &quot;MAXConviction&quot; as a referrer on the registration.\r\n\r\nTHANKS FOR YOUR TIME!!! SEE YOU ON THE BATTLEFIELD SUMMONERS!!!","replies":[{"poster":"Fenrir Ryu","date":"2016-08-15T14:02:53.358+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"add me if u guys are still looking for people I have a account in silver 2 and a account in bronze for fun  I play the bronze one because then doesn't matter when ilose games try thing outs etc cheers","replies":[]}]}
