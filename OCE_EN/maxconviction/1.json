TG consists of active gamers which have a &quot;real life first&quot; mindset. We aim to satisfy our member&#039;s needs for team based gaming by having our Tactical Warfare franchise for warfare based games and our Tactical Sports franchise for sports based games.\n\nAt the moment OCE for TG is looking for new members to be incorporated in an environment where their peers and themselves are all working towards the same goal, to improve. Whether you are a serious gamer looking to take commitment to the next level or just a casual player who is looking for a team to play with and improve with, we can help.\nTactical Gaming is quite a structured gaming community compared to most and this is regulated by the ongoing efforts of the Squad Leaders, their main duty is to post updates and schedule &#039;Practices&#039;. Currently the mandatory practice days for OCE are Sunday and Wednesday, both from 7pm to 9 pm. There is also optional practices in between. \n\nLooking for new members **ANY** rank and **ANY** role.\n\nIf you&#039;re interested feel free to add me on discord and i can help and assist you through the registration process and test phase or even if you are wanting to acquire more information regarding the community.\n\nDiscord - maxconviction#6391\n\nSee you on the Rift Summoners \n{{sticker:slayer-pantheon-thumbs}}","replies":[]}
