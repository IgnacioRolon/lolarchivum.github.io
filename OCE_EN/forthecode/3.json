I am a Silver V ADC main that enjoys being competitive and using Jinx, Tristana, and Caitlyn. I would also like become good with Kog'Maw, and Twitch or Corki. I don't like playing Lucian although i know he's good. Eventually i would like to build a team but i want to start with a foundation of a good bot lane duo. One of the best aspects i can see to having a Duo partner and eventually a team is that we won't have as many Intentional feeders, trolls or even smurfs coming in and making it all one sided and ruining the fun for people in our games (no matter which side the offending player is on).\r\n\r\nI don't play on any hard schedule but i really like league and am on most days in the afternoon and early night time, on most days.\r\n\r\nWhat i offer as an ADC main:\r\n\r\n-    A serious, competitive attitude towards climbing the ranked ladder.\r\n-    A specific, attainable and measurable initial goal of Gold V.\r\n-    An introspective attitude of self improvement first and constructive critique next.\r\n-    An appreciation that you're the one who get's me fed, supports are %60 of lane phase.\r\n-    \"Proficiency\" (relative to my rank) with 3 ADC's, each with good KDA's and win rates.\r\n-    An understanding of some of the basic lane mechanics and when to apply each tactic (pushing, freezing, pulling, zoning, good engages on ganks, kill             lanes, poke lanes, sustain lanes)\r\n-    The ability to fill lanes if we don't get what we want, although with less experience.\r\n-    Usually a decent internet connection so i don't often lag or D/C.\r\n\r\nWhat you will bring to the team as a Support main:\r\n\r\n-    A serious, competitive attitude towards climbing the ranked ladder.\r\n-    Share the goal of reaching Gold V through self improvement \r\n-    Proficiency in a number of support champions AND types, eg. Sona for poke and sustain, Blitzcrank for kill and engage, Braum for tanking and CC, and picking to suit the team, with positive win rates and good KDA's.\r\n-    The ability to fill lanes if we don't get what we want, although with less experience.\r\n-    A decent internet connection so you won't lag and D/C often (this is Australia and our tech infrastructure is bad comparably to many countries so we can't expect perfect connections from eachother). \r\n\r\nIf you're interested in applying to be my duo partner and in eventually being part of a ranked team reply here or add me in the client, IGN: mylifeforauir87","replies":[{"poster":"DiddlyDonger","date":"2014-12-22T23:22:36.431+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hi there! \n\nRecently I've been playing ranked a lot and decided I would try to climb for gold.
