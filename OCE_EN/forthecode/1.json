Your advice please.","subforum":"Gameplay & Strategy","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"How Much do i really need AD marks for adc?\r\n\r\nI have always resented them being part of my setup, they seem so underwhelming.\r\n\r\nI have a setup i mainly use with 9 AD marks, 3 AS quints, 9 Armor seals and 4 AS glyphs and 5 MR glyphs. What i would like to do is run 9 AS marks and 3 LifeSteal Quints instead, keeping the seals and glyphs the same. I feel this would be better for laning because you would have the sustain, but how much harder will it be to last hit? Is it worth buying a long sword earl for extra AD after your original dorans start?\r\n\r\nany advice is appreciated. Thanks guys.","replies":[{"poster":"ToxicHawk","date":"2014-12-12T00:24:12.655+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"I agree with what people have said. I main ADC and it really depends on what your after (as RainbowWindslash has pointed out).\n\nIt also really depends on what champion you are playing and then what playstyle.\n\nFor example if your playing Cait, I would take AD Marks, get that farm and harass in early. You don't generally need armor pen early as the armor that players have is quite low.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Your Neighbour","date":"2014-12-12T23:29:04.534+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Makes last hitting easier, more c/s = earlier BFS = more brutality\n\nhttp://matchhistory.oce.leagueoflegends.com/en/#match-details/OC1/71681532/200514951?tab=overview\n\nIMO attack speed is icing on the cake for Caitlyn, it's good to have more AS but shouldn't be your core build as Caitlyn since it's not the cake itself. \n\nFor Vayne and Twitch it's a bit different, you will definitely need some attack speed.\n\nOnly take armor pen if you are 100% sure you will win the lane.
