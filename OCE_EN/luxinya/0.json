I have never hacked, scripted or got elo boosted before. My only &quot;third party program&quot; usage is only op.gg, if thats bannable then you better ban out the whole community.......\r\n\r\nI just left league for 2 months, when I am back and I am banned.

If cheaters are aware of what Riot is capable of detecting then they can avoid it. Riot cannot tell you what they detected because it'll just let those people know what they *didn't* detect, and the problem with cheaters would be significantly worse.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2016-03-06T03:48:00.068+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"An account found to be **cheating or using scripts/disallowed third party programs OF ANY KIND** will be permanently suspended without any warning.
