It's verbal abuse and harassment and I can only assume unwarranted. I hate Teemo with a passion as well too the point I have the unfortunate confession that I too have been toxic to people just purely based on their pick but truth is they don't deserve it. In most cases people don't take lg serious. Most of us don't earn money from it or play in world teams so just let people do their thing and congratulate them if they do well and take it as a lesson to improve you're game for next time.","replies":[]},{"poster":"YellowBrickRoad","date":"2016-07-19T13:58:02.421+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"Waste of time, Rito gives zero shits about oce, get used to it.","replies":[{"poster":"Wuks","date":"2016-07-20T07:05:25.161+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=YellowBrickRoad,realm=OCE,application-id=T8eq2lFQ,discussion-id=J7sE74Xx,comment-id=0002,timestamp=2016-07-19T13:58:02.421+0000)\n>\n> Waste of time, Rito gives zero shits about oce, get used to it.\n\nhttp://img.wonkette.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/biden-malarky-gif.gif\n\nThe Instant Feedback system works by learning off of the reports of players.

Ever since then I've reported everyone's ass. If they excessively swear and discriminate against people, report their ass... If they're being rude to you telling you that you're trash, report their ass... If they think they're the best and try control the team like they're the leader, report their ass... If someone is rage-quitting/rage-feeding, report their ass...

Feed or carry, you picked arguably the least liked champion in league of legends and a good teemo is not fun to lane against. Report them if they are especially toxic but the community is kinda like this so it's not really going to make much of a difference and muting them and moving on the next game is generally the easiest option.","replies":[]}]}
