But generally try to pay attention to which champions people have selected and their summoners. \nThe sup usually has exhaust, the adc will be a marksman with heal, the top will usually have tp, the mid will clearly state they are mid constantly in chat so just ask who is mid and get a stream of copypasta in response 'mid or afk' and the jungler sometimes has smite and sometimes argues that ignite and ghost is better for jungling and you want to strangle them but you gotta accept your elo.","replies":[]},{"poster":"bgentle2myashe","date":"2016-07-19T11:31:15.618+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Sometimes people join late and you may have missed the call.
