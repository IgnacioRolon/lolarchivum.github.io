Everyone always says that 4v5's happen more often, but that is mathematically impossible. For every game lost because of an afk or troll or feeder, 5 people benefit and 4 people don't. Statistically you will be a part of that 5 person group 20% more often than the 4. So if you're gonna argue for loss prevention, then they should implement win prevention as well","replies":[]},{"poster":"Roguestoney","date":"2015-11-05T02:33:16.061+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Because they know when someone is going to have connection issues or afk in ever game before the game starts.
