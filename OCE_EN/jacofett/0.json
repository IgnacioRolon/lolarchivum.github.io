I try almost every game and I focus on improving and playing for improvement but I cant get out of Bronze 2 and it is where I also started. I have played about 200-300 hours since I got into Bronze 2 and still cannot get out. I main Katarina and I watch lots of videos and streams such as Gbay99, Nightblue, HotshotGG, SickMotion, C9, etc. How do I know if i'm improving and how can I improve on things to get to gold? \nI would really appreciate your advice.\nFYI: http://oce.op.gg/summoner/userName=JacoFett   -- My profile","replies":[{"poster":"BarryButcher","date":"2014-12-23T06:46:08.372+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You have also only played 50 ranked games which is roughly 25-30 hours of play time. not 200-300.","replies":[{"poster":"JacoFett","date":"2014-12-23T06:53:58.921+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I meant since I started ranked I have played 200-300 hours (normal and ranked combined) worth of league and have no idea if I have actually gotten better even though I have been trying that whole time.","replies":[{"poster":"BarryButcher","date":"2014-12-23T08:51:42.078+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I play a lot of normals, but I don't think they help that much. People play out of position, play champions they normally wouldn't and all round just arent trying as hard in normals. You also get put against people with varying ranks.\n\nTry playing more ranked consistently. I notice that most your ranked games are 1 or 2 a day then you don't play ranked again fro 5 or 6 days.\nRanked is the best way to improve your play and test whether you are getting better. If you climb you are getting better, if you don't, your not.\n\nSome very basic advice:\nIf all the enemy team is dead push a lane, don't back and heal.\nIf the enemy jungler is top and you kill the enemy mid or bot lane, do dragon.\nRaging at \"feeders\" doesn't help anyone\n/mute is your friend\ntry timing summoner spells (5min for flash/tp, 3.5min for ignite/exh/barrier)\nLearn how every champion works (basically).
