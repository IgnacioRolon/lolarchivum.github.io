I joined back and there was no sound playing... i didn&#039;t think there was anything wrong with this problem so i continued playing. We won the game and when i went to the main menu it told me that i have been put into a lower priority queue. I was extremely confused as to why this happened and would like to know why it has happened.\r\n\r\np.s. (This game was a while ago because i have been too busy to ask about it).","replies":[{"poster":"JasonWazza","date":"2015-04-09T05:26:10.983+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"So you DC'd and reconnected, and your asking why after said afking, you are in low priority queue, which is designed for people who regularly afk?","replies":[]},{"poster":"Project Xayah","date":"2015-04-09T03:21:16.078+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Leavebuster only takes 5 minutes to mark someone as AFK/DC and it recognises more as AFK than what you would expect. Even someone who is running around base could be marked as AFK if they weren't doing anything significant, such as entering combat.\n\nWhat exactly did the pop-up say? If it was just the one where you agree (by typing \"I agree\" or something) to not AFK/DC then it hasn't put you in LPQ, it's just an early warning for it. Otherwise contact Riot support and they should be able to point out every instance you have been marked as AFK/DC and, if the system became faulty, be more capable of ensuring it doesn't happen again.\n\nThat said if your connection is failing that often it would be a good idea to look into it before continuing to play. It is solely the responsibility of the player to ensure they meet the connection requirements of the game so ignoring such an issue would mean you're breaking the TOU and EULA, reason enough for Riot to give you a permaban.","replies":[{"poster":"EnthunianFazul","date":"2015-04-09T03:25:08.163+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"ok, i understand what you're saying... but i only reconnected which took about 3 mins not 5....","replies":[]}]}]}
