So naturally i just shut down my PC and went away after this had happened. Today when i got on i felt like playing a game, but because my internet has crashed in the middle of a game before, it set me to wait 20 whole minutes. Now to the point, just because someone's internet crashes, does that really mean you have to wait because of the LeaverBuster? I don't find this fair at all, because i know this has happened to other people and not just me. I think this is an issue which should be changed.","replies":[{"poster":"HORSE OF FORCE","date":"2015-01-17T10:23:24.850+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Um,\n\nwell,\n\nyou still leave the game.","replies":[]}]}
