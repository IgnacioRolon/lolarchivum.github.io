The OCE community is so toxic I have pretty much given up playing the game, outside of ARAM time wasters over 20 minutes during a coffee break or something. OCE Ranked is a joke. OCE Normals are actually worse.\n\nTribunal is a lie.\nLeave-Buster is a lie.\n\nThe game is decided, simply; Team with the least trolls wins. This goes for normals and ARAMS (Not even including the 90% of games that include a leaver or AFKer).\n\nThe funny part is; Riots actual Terms and Conditions of use state that Riot protect it's users against this kind of behaviour. Riot, in themselves; are breaching their own ToS. Do they care?\n\nIt's really not worth mentioning that Riot are 'working' on the tribunal, as some of the 'suspected trolls' are suggesting. Fact is; \nRiot are too busy making money from the championships.\n\nThe smaller community, which helped build this game to it's current form, mean nothing anymore. I've been playing since soon after BETA, and bought so many champions and or skins with cash it's not funny. It was hard enough getting a refund for my Nurse Akali skin when they changed it.\n\nTLDR;\nDon't even try, good sir, to have fun in this game anymore. Nor should you try getting any input or response from Riot. Enjoy the game simply for what it is; a quick time waster filled with frustration and disappointment.\n\nFACTS!","replies":[{"poster":"GetPhuckd","date":"2015-01-22T13:10:12.181+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"i lost my promos and ended up in bronze 5, i feel","replies":[]},{"poster":"RNG Remilia","date":"2015-01-22T09:11:14.230+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You know LoL is actually kinda fun unless you insist on feeding in ARAMs all day every day...","replies":[]},{"poster":"Maraudaur","date":"2015-01-23T01:24:14.569+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Hey Captain Dusty,\n\nI'm really sorry you feel that way. Why do you think the Tribunal and Leaver Buster are lies? I have seen multiple players \"complain\" that they are in low priority queue.\n\nEven though the tribunal is down for upgrades we are working on multiple systems to improve player behaviour. Right now we have multiple automatic systems in place to punish negative behaviour; for example\n\n**Live**\n\nLeaverBuster (this is the system that punishes afkers)\nChat restrictions\nIntentional feeder bans\nManual audits\n\n**Currently testing**\n\nAutomatic verbal abuse bans\n\nThis is of course just the negative stuff, we are also working on ways to promote and recognize positive play within our community as well!\nhttp://oce.leagueoflegends.com/en/news/game-updates/special-event/celebrating-end-years-snowdown\n\nOur player behavior philosophies include punishment, reform, and positive reinforcement. There's no silver bullet to improving player behavior in online games, and you always need a mix of punishments and rewards.
