{"poster":"GRIM Spirit","date":"2016-05-10T05:06:45.190+0000","title":"Warwick rework concept (feedback wanted!)","subforum":"Player Creations","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"As many of you may know, Warwick has been a champ that has had many problems in League of Legends with being so simplistic that very minor changes to the game can make him go from an unknown champion to the destroyer of solo queue. This concept is aimed at putting a little more into his kit so that he has more numbers that can be changed if his strengths/weaknesses is a pressing matter, but still make him a lower-difficulty type of champion. Again, feedback is much wanted!\n\n---\n\n**The Basics:**\n\nThematically, Warwick is a man that drank a potion and transformed into a wolf-man. Now, when I (and most people) think of a wolf-man, we think of a werewolf who transforms under a full moon. When playing Warwick, I want the player to feel like they can go from the crazed man who hunts people down to beast that tears the enemy apart at the click of a button, so the most important part of this concept is that _Warwick&#039;s ult will transform him_. I&#039;m not talking about a Jayce or Nidalee transformation, this will be a timed transformation that after running out, will revert him to being human. It will then go onto a long cooldown before he may transform again.Again, this concept is to keep the feel of Warwick _basically_ the same, yet make a distinct difference between the man and the beast.\n\n---\n\n**The Lore:**\n\nWarwicks' lore could remain _mostly_ similar. Currently, the lore is that he was tasked to bring back 3 ingredients, the first two he obtained but the third was _the heart of a celestial being_. He failed to take down Soraka, and in turn drank the unfinished potion knowing that there were risks. I would alter the lore to include the Lunari, a part of the lore around Mount Targon that is very unrefined. Currently only Diana has lore directly tied with them, and a very slim amount at that. I would add something similar to this to his lore...\n\n_After Warwick failed to bring down Soraka and obtain her heart, he furiously searched for another means to acquire the final ingredient. Soon he learned of an old, forgotten group that lived under the shadow of Mount Targon, a place known well for it's cosmic and celestial powers, known as the Lunari. The hunter made quick pace to track down this place, if it truly existed. And while his previous prey defeated him, after some time Warwick was able to discover a temple, buried in the darkness and rocks of the mountain, with just a glimmer of silver light to guide his eyes. Exploring into this temple he found few things, and began to believe that the ruins were worthless. Finally, at the end of his journey there was a cloister, that seemed impossible to him as it should be deep inside the mountain. Peering to the far side was a staircase which, at the top held a peculiar item. Warwick snatched the item as compensation and quickly fled, disappointed in his findings. Upon returning to Singed, he was informed that the item he acquired was an ancient and forgotten relic that did come from the Lunari, a relic that they worshiped as 'The Heart of the Moon'. Warwick then gave the ingredient to Singed to finish the potion, and he quickly downed it once it was complete. Not long after he drank the potion, he could feel its effect take hold. It granted him power, power that he desired to continue his work, but it came with other effects. He became mad and bloodthirsty, his typical acquisitions of new specimens rarely brought them back alive, and he felt another urge when he saw the moon in the sky._\n\n_On some nights he would not remember what he had done, or where the bodies that he'd taken had came from. But it no longer mattered to him..._\n\n---\n\n**The Skills:**\n\n- To conserve space, I will be leaving most of the  _flavor text_ out of the following section\n- Additionally, this is only a concept, so numbers will be used sparingly (I&#039;m not a balancing expert)\n\nPassive: Fresh blood / Thrill - Warwick&#039;s basic attacks on enemy champions and large monsters give him a stack of &#039;fresh blood&#039;, stacking up to 3 times. Once acquiring 3 stacks, they are converted into a stack of Thrill, granting him bonus Attack Speed and an amount of health restored on every auto attack. Warwick may have up to 2 stacks of Thrill at a time. Stacks of fresh blood will time out in about 4 seconds while out of combat, while Thrill stacks will run out after about 12 seconds while out of combat.\n\nQ: (Unnamed) - Warwick targets an enemy within melee range and slashes them with his blade at a vital location, damaging them and making them bleed over time. This ability applies on-hit effects, as well as gives him a stack of Fresh Blood.\n\nW: Hamstring - Warwick&#039;s next basic attack targets his opponents hamstrings, causing them to be slowed based on how many stacks of Thrill he has.\n\nE: Blood Tracking - Warwick is able to see the blood that enemy&#039;s leave, causing enemy champions who are dealt damage by either allied champions or neutral monsters to leave a trail on the ground for some time. The trail is visible longer on the jungle ground and lesser in lane areas, and the color fades to tell the player if it&#039;s a fresh trail or if the enemy has been gone for a while. Additionally, Warwick gains increased movement speed while he is following near to a trail.\n\nR: (Unnamed) - Warwick let&#039;s go to his urge for blood, dropping his weapon and transforming into a werewolf. Stacks of Thrill make the transformation faster, otherwise it takes about 2 seconds. During this time, the sun sets and the full moon comes out, _slightly_ reducing all enemy sight radius&#039;s (very slight, we&#039;re not talking Nocturne ult here). While transformed; Warwick gains empowered abilities as well as access to Infinite Duress, stacks of Thrill no longer time out while out of combat, and any Attack Speed gained from Thrill or items is converted into bonus Attack Damage.\n\nUlted Q: Hungering Strike - Warwick swiped out in front of him, lightly damaging all enemies that are hit, but causing them to bleed profusely. Warwick will be healed by a high % of the damage dealt from the initial strike. This will apply on-hit effects and grant a stack of Fresh Blood if he is not at full stacks of Thrill.\n\nUlted W: Hunter&#039;s Call - Warwick lets out a howl at the full moon, slowing the movespeed of nearby enemies as well as granting himself and nearby allies bonus Attack Speed, both based on his stacks of Thrill.\n\nUlted E: Blood Scent: Warwick&#039;s heightened senses allow him to smell the blood from his enemies. This causes enemies within range who are below 50% hp to be visible at all times, as well as enemies who have recently been damaged by allied champions or neutral monsters to be visible for a short time. While Warwick is moving towards a sensed enemy, he gains continually increasing movespeed, up to a cap. At the cap, Warwick may activate Blood Scent to leap a distance. _(The leap will be explained soon)_\n\nUlted R: Infinite Duress - Warwick targets an enemy champion within melee range and begins ravaging them, suppressing and applying on-hit effects only to the target. If the ability in allowed to finish, Warwick will end it with a powerful area of effect swing. Damage dealt by this ability to the target and any enemy caught inside the area of effect will heal Warwick for a % of the damage dealt.\n\n---\n\n**Reasons for my thoughts:**\n\n1) First off, the leap. Why does Blood Scent have a leap? The answer is that a lot of people don&#039;t like being clicked on and being unable to move, which is exactly what current Warwick, a jungle champion&#039;s ult does from a distance. My concept has gated his powers in many ways, this being one of them. If you want to suppress someone from a distance, you&#039;ll have to run at them first to get the leap, otherwise you&#039;ll be casually walking up to them or be waiting in a bush to get them.\n\n2) Warwick&#039;s sustain is one of his key features, I don&#039;t want to take that away from him, but I&#039;ve made it so that you have to commit to multiple camps if you really want to get that sustain. It may take half way through a jungle camp to get all of your Thrill up, and during that time you won&#039;t be healing nearly as much on your basic attacks and Q&#039;s. Now you choose between getting that red buff and going straight to lane, or doing two camps and going to a lane at nearly full health.\n\n3) His new W Hamstring. Warwick basically can&#039;t gank before 6. I mean, it&#039;s possible, but it basically isn&#039;t. This ability at the least allows him to walk up behind an opponent who has pushed up too far, land a few auto attacks and a Q, then slow them for your ally to catch up. This is not the strongest gank, but it gives him something. HOWEVER, this is more to go in line with his new E. This ability will make him a strong jungle duelist early, allowing him a quick burst with his auto Q auto, giving him the first stack on Thirst so he can get more attack speed and heal, and when the opponent decides to leave he can just chase them down with the slow and the movespeed from their blood trail.\n\n4) Why doesn&#039;t Thrill fall off when he is ulted, and why does he randomly gain Attack Damage? The truth is that I do like the simplistic kit and play style that Warwick has, the concept I made is to give him a little more. Now that you aren&#039;t always a Werewolf, I gave him access to his healing from Thrill at all points during his Ult as well as some Attack Damage just give him free strength during this time. Think Riven Ult; temporary free stats, empowered abilities, and a one-time-use bonus ulti. The part where he converts Attack Speed from items came when I thought about people who build items like BotRK or Wit&#039;s End for the on-hit effects. Warwick as a human should be an smaller, agile hunter who tracks and trades with his prey, while the beast side of him should be larger, bulkier and hit harder. Imagine current Warwick with BotRK, Hunter&#039;s Call active AND gaining even more attack speed from his passive. To me that doesn&#039;t really sound like a bulky werewolf.\n\n5) His ulted Q heals him for a lot? AND bleeds? Well, it doesn&#039;t really heal him for a lot. In human form he goes for a vital area, but in beast mode he just claws the area, so the initial damage will be lower, but cause massive bleeding to those hit. This is why he can heal a lot from the initiate damage, because there&#039;s actually not too much there.\n\n---\n\nTHAT&#039;S IT, thank you to all who read this through all the way. Please leave any reviews and questions in the comments! Warwick is a champion that I&#039;ve played since before season one started, and it&#039;s sad to see that no serious changes have been made. Riot says that they&#039;ve had a number of potential reworks that they&#039;ve tried, but we&#039;ve yet to actually see any that have been up to par in their eyes! So this was my take at the champion, maybe one day we&#039;ll have our killer werewolf champion be the envy of all the other hunters.","replies":[{"poster":"Fitzky","date":"2016-05-10T05:08:48.449+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Riot are already currently reworking warwick rip","replies":[{"poster":"GRIM Spirit","date":"2016-05-10T05:13:17.076+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You're right, but we never really know if it will get scrapped again.

And it would be timed, so you'd be in that form for X amount of seconds.\n\nYeah, something about needing her heart to finish the potion to make him stable is/was the lore. I did think about Diana, I had an idea drifting around that the current lore could stay how it is, and just tack in a part right after he gets beaten by Soraka that he turned to get something from another celestial being. That he stole something like an 'artifact of the moon' and since he stole it, the god became angry and made his gift a curse. This could tie Warwick in with Diana as well as the Solari, since the current Riot thing to do is make every champ have connections to many others.\n\nThanks for the feedback though, it's much appreciated!","replies":[{"poster":"Talon12","date":"2016-05-11T11:39:09.077+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> The recipe called for three critical components: silver from the Shadow Isles, the fang of a Balefire dire wolf, and the heart of a celestial being\n\nyup was the heart \n\nHe failed...

Mount Targon is currently being flushed out with lore for any champions that have anything to do with it, so it would be easy to do that. Basically like I said in the previous comment, add new lore that in a long forgotten Lunari temple (Maybe where Diana found her blade and armor, but that's for another lore) Warwick stole an artifact rumored to be 'The Heart of the Moon' and used that in the potion instead and it drove him mad.","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Hounorsboy","date":"2016-05-10T08:40:11.037+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"it just sounds like another nidalee","replies":[{"poster":"GRIM Spirit","date":"2016-05-10T21:11:25.349+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"In the theme of the champion, yeah maybe a little bit.
