Make sure your email is verified by clicking your profile in the top right and going to **Settings**, and that Riot Games is not blacklisted and sending emails to your spam folder.\n\n-DTN","replies":[{"poster":"JacobJJ","date":"2017-04-17T23:20:31.993+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey DTN, was wondering if I could get another email from riot, turns out I didn't diversify my email and for some reason don't have a spam folder, if possible could I be sent another one, spent a lot of Rp on my JacobJJ account\n\nThanks","replies":[{"poster":"Deep Terror Nami","date":"2017-04-18T00:45:55.275+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Not sure if they can send you a duplicate email from that, but they can definitely follow up on your case and provide what details they can if you submit a [Support Ticket](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/requests/new).","replies":[]}]}]}]}
