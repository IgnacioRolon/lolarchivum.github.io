It takes literally an hour some times to get into a lobby people don't dodge. I queued tonight at 8:50. It's now 9:39 and I'm still not in a game it's just been dodge after dodge. it happens like this literally every weekend. I genuinely don't understand why younger kids dodge  so much more","replies":[{"poster":"rightclicku","date":"2019-06-30T11:23:59.262+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The fact that dodges count toward your autofill protection count is fucking ridiculous. I just wanted to play one top lane game before bed tonight. got top someone dodged, got top someone dodged, autofilled mid so played my autofill. try to queue again, got top, someone dodges. Got top again, someone dodges, get autofilled support. I've played my autofill I shouldn't be needing to again so I dodge. 6 minutes later requeue. get top, someone dodges, get top someone dodges, get autofilled support again. Again I dodge, 15 minutes later I queue again, get top. someone dodges, get top someone dodges, get autofilled support but I'm on 15 minute timers now so I give up. Tried to queue for literally one top lane game at 7:30. It's now 9:30, I've managed to get into 1 game and it wasn't a top and I don't have time to queue any more. How is this system fun for anyone?","replies":[]},{"poster":"rightclicku","date":"2019-06-30T08:23:49.518+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"They need to make it so dodges do not count toward your autofill protected games. There's been talk of them for a few seasons now. Every season they say next season. You play your autofill, then you have 3 people dodge queues, then you're autofilled again. You play your autofill then you have 3 queue dodgers again then you're autofilled again. If you have autofill protected games, you should not lose them because someone dodged.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Herm1t","date":"2019-06-29T18:29:22.538+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"SAME!
