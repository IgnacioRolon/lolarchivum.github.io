As soon as they appear in the lobby people start calling them out for being bots. They all have the same randomised names, they always take the same sums, in game you can tell by their item purchase, the way they move is obvious, the way they randomly change lanes, they don't respond to communications. You could write a massive list of ways they're extremely obvious to spot. Every player in the game can spot them a mile off. But RIOT appears to not be able to. How is that possible? Every games it's the same bots, they're all still botting punishment free, yet I'm on 20 minute game timers from dodging lobbies full of bots. How is that fair?","replies":[{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2019-06-13T02:51:43.905+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"They do, but bots are banned in waves not individually. This is largely to keep detection methods obscure, preventing botters from determining what exactly is being detected and thus keeping the bots easier to detect. There are also a lot of bots banned manually. Rare is it that a bot will make it to level 30.\n\nUnfortunately, bots being what they are they congregate in co-op vs AI and very low MMR ARAMs and norms (so typically new accounts that will encounter them). If playing at a quiet hour then the bots will be a greater percentage of accounts you are encountering.\n\nThere are systems in the works (testing on EU) that match bots only against other bots until they are banned in the next wave, but until it's properly stable it's going to remain a test system and won't be rolled out fully.\n\nThe best thing you can do is report them for cheating and move on. Once you hit level 20 or so you'll stop seeing them, especially if you play at more active hours of the day.","replies":[{"poster":"Exarch Leona","date":"2019-06-14T11:12:09.611+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"\"The best thing you can do is report them for cheating and move on.

Even playing at weird-ish times I haven't seen a bot on my main in years. Only time I've seen bots recently was when levelling a new account, and at lvl 15-20 they petered off fast. Still see them on that low account in ARAMs sometimes, but not every game anymore.\n\nFrom the majority of experiences I've heard, bots are gone from norms by lvl 30 at the latest and mostly gone from ARAMs after 15-20 games.\n\nThat's not to say everyone will have that experience, MMR is a consideration as well. A smurf will stop seeing them much sooner than a legitimate new player for example, but your experience is not one I have heard at all really, though you don't mention frequency. \n\nI'm sure there's a factor causing you to still see them, but without deeper backend info (i.e stuff the general community doesn't have access to) I can only speculate on what it/they might be,","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"rightclicku","date":"2019-06-13T00:37:25.929+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'm in a game right now with 2 bots on my team and 3 on the other team.
