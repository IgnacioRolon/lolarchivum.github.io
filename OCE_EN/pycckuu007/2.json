Players who’ve been punished will no longer earn Hextech Chests through achieving an S rank on the Rift, nor will they earn key fragments after matchmade victories. This restriction will be lifted after your punishment ends and you’ve shown clear improvement. Because it’s based on your personal behavior, there’s no set date or time when this will happen.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Ingénue","date":"2016-05-18T13:22:34.726+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Have a read of [this article](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/209939463-Hextech-Crafting-Restrictions), it should have the answers to your questions.\n\nMainly this part:\n>REFORM PERIOD\nOnce your punishment ends, you'll enter a reform period, during which you'll remain ineligible to earn Hextech Chests and Keys. Ending this reform period requires consistent displays of good sportsmanship. Your reform period isn't over after a speicifc number of games, or after a certain date, but is completely dependent upon your behavior.","replies":[]},{"poster":"JasonWazza","date":"2016-05-18T11:09:15.344+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It's probably counting all season.\n\nThat said there was a few things that i believe riot lyte said that a reforming player may be considered for things, however that was regarding end of season rewards and not Hextech things.","replies":[]}]}
