So I decided to draw it:\r\n\r\nhttp://imgur.com/uyKHyRj\r\n\r\nHuman Form\r\nQ - The spear tip is made from blue plasma energy.\r\nW - A trap with a detector in the middle and springs together like a bear trap.\r\nE - Looks kind of like the recalling but more blue and fades off into pixels.\r\nR - Nidalee fades into glowing blue pixels which form into a cougar shape and then fade into the cougar form of the skin.\r\n\r\nCougar Form\r\nQ - The blue lines glow brighter and when the attack is used some blue pixels or sparks fly off.\r\nW - A small trail of blue pixels during the jump.\r\nE - Similar to the regular Swipe, but blue.\r\nR - Vice versa of the Human Form.\r\n\r\nPlease comment if you like it or if you have any further ideas.","replies":[{"poster":"Bunny","date":"2015-10-05T11:01:48.816+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It looks pretty awesome. It seems quite similar in a sense to the Headhunter Nidalee because she has cyberish animations. She also has a lot of skins too so I personally with your artistic skills try and find maybe heroes with limited skins.
