They discuss the concept of the changes and some other stuff.\nHe is different now. His difficulty has gone up a bit. 0.75 is a little bit long, but I'm not sure about it being too long. I got trapped in it a few times today. I'd like to see it some more before I make my final judgements.","replies":[]},{"poster":"cw1988","date":"2016-03-29T04:20:58.449+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"make his q more rewarding, hsi ap ratio sucks now.","replies":[]},{"poster":"DoomMinion","date":"2015-09-20T02:40:47.226+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"What a {{champion:35}} Veigar one of the most op champs in game","replies":[]},{"poster":"TrashDonnut","date":"2015-02-26T11:31:17.294+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Unplayable?","replies":[]},{"poster":"Mar3thyu","date":"2015-02-26T10:40:33.417+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"veigar is still fine just means he has to use stun better","replies":[]},{"poster":"iNG001","date":"2015-02-26T10:40:08.165+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"he was my fav champ too and i have spent really long to practice smart cast e. but now the 0.75 second e just ruined everything i played a game today and realized how useless he is now and i will never touch him again,","replies":[]},{"poster":"Knuuckles","date":"2015-02-26T09:46:32.221+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"idear, laining, lol, the idea behind the entire thing is to make it so he can't 100-0 the same thing they have done with almost every assassin in the game, it gives him some actual mechanical prowess rather than hitting e and free kill, veigar was a skill-less, face rolling, ridiculous champion and you should feel dumb for making this thread","replies":[]}]}
