Riot Games are still overwhelmingly surprising the League community with brand new and unique champion designs and features. What i&#039;m thinking about all of a sudden is, has anyone in the dev team thought of / tested with a specifically larger champion in perportion amongst others? Someting along the lines of maybe a centipede creature from the void. Something even like a playable baron (but more logical), a giant and bizzare predator of some sort. It would be interesting to see what ideas could come along future champions development to benefit from this. As of now, the only champion that I can think of comparing is Aurelion Sol but on a greater scale. \r\nHeyman it&#039;s just an idea. Centipedes are strange.","replies":[]}
