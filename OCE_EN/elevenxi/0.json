Looking for a team of 5 to experience real League of Legends.\n\nYes I had a full time job. I had what most were looking for, \"financial security\", living the Aussie dream. Yes I really did quit. Did I quit for Leauge? No. I quit for my own life. I want to live doing the things I love and enjoy. I want to chase my goals and dreams. I have ambitions and I will work hard towards it. One of those goals now is yes, #R04D2D14M0ND. I am seeking your help in achieving this goal. Can you help me?\n\nI want to mention, No, I don't want you to boost me. Thank you for your act of kindness, I am looking for those who will teach me my mistakes. I am new to the game, YOU are the expert.

If you're 'super fed' but can't take a turret or buff after a teamfight... you're not actually winning. You got bored of normal games where people have perfect-build-mentality and 'don't care'. You know how to win and want to win, so you joined the ladder. \n\n\nTo be Silver\nGood set up - good runes/masteries, good diversity in unlocked champions, good item path, good gaming equipment\nWhen I decided to get serious about LoL I unlocked the majority of champs and runes, and i upgraded my kit so i wouldn't have latency issues and so that i can see/hear more in game - bigger screen, better audio. I got a corded mouse so it felt more responsive. I had a rune/mastery set for every role/champion i play. Rune pages and Masteries are so important, as they can either help or stop you from farming easily at the start of the game, with the exception of keystones being about play style. Being zoned at level 1/2 and lagging out will kill your chances of winning immediately. Set yourself up to get ahead!\n\n\nTo be Gold \nGood mechanics (Farming, warding, team fights, pushing) \nPractice your champ enough that you can act instinctively. If you can harrass your lane opponent while last hitting, moving, and watching the mini-map, then you've made it mechanically. Build your core item before the other guy does then start applying the pressure and you'll probably succeed. Know your champion limits and power levels/spikes. Engage when you know you can inflict the most damage while using the least resource (your health is a resource).\n\n\nTo be Platinum \nGood counter-strategies and specialisation\nBecause everyone at this point is good mechanically, it can just be the minor differences in team composition that make or break a game. You'll want to have alternative options in select so you can make a better choice - Your team doesn't need another assassin! Don't pick that mage into Zed mid! How are you going to beat a Soraka as Janna? No one plays that champ since the patch!\nYou want what ever you pick to beat whatever they pick, so you need to master quite a few options. Then in game you want to build/play/pressure so that you exploit your opponents weaknesses and negate their strengths. Knowing all the champions in the game, knowing their strengths and weaknesses, their likely play style, and being able to respond to that with a deliberate champion choice, item path and play style - that's what got me to platinum.\n\n\nTo be Diamond \nGood leadership\nTo be diamond you can't just rely on your personal strengths and knowledge. Because everyone in platinum is amazing at their role and champion. You have to bring out the best in your team. Communication is so key, but also your actions. When you understand that every thing you do affects your team then you're starting to think like a leader. Toxicity kills teams because it breaks trust, breaks communication, breaks morale and it tries to justify selfishness. Leaders make good decisions that benefit the team and speak out against bad decisions. The Art of War by General Tsu helps. Be quick! Be deceptive! Plant a mole in the enemy camp!\nFrom what i read of your posts it sounds like you'll be a good leader.\n\n\nI feel sheepish for writing such an essay. Oh well, I just want you to succeed like i did.
