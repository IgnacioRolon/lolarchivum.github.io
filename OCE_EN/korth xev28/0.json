But before the new shop, i would click on her to check how much rp I would have left.\r\nThe new change to the shop bought it straight away. I hate riven, because when i vs her she is so troll so i will never play her. Can you please refund her, you can check i have never played a game with her. There was no waring about the change, this would mean a lot to me (880 rp) so if you respond to this i would greatly appreciate it\r\n\r\nusername is Korth and in game name is Korth xev28\r\n\r\nbtw taligha is good champ, keep it up","replies":[{"poster":"SephirothSG","date":"2016-05-21T00:27:27.842+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey there,\n\nIf you don't currently have any refund tokens left then you're unable to refund any purchased content nor will Riot provide refunds under any circumstance.\n\nSee the [Content Refund FAQ](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201751864-Content-Refund-FAQ) for more information.\n\nAs far as I can tell, you're still prompted before purchasing a champion or skin.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Korth xev28","date":"2016-05-19T06:58:45.490+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I am getting\n\n\nirritated about riven on my champ list","replies":[{"poster":"husktoucher","date":"2016-05-19T07:10:48.807+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Most of Riot is prolly asleep. Your best bet is to put a support ticket in, or use one of your refund tokens, if you have any remaining. It sounds like you clicked way too fast though, which is more of an unfortunate user error than a bug or issue that's Riot's responsibility. \n\nYou can submit a ticket here: https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/requests/new\n\nGLHF","replies":[{"poster":"Korth xev28","date":"2016-05-19T09:39:39.618+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I was not told that it used my rp straight away,\n\nIn the old shop it would show the amount to rp you would have after the transaction but it acted instantly and now riven is in my character pool. \n\nI would not mind getting 5000 ip or something instead of rp.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Korth xev28","date":"2016-05-19T09:32:30.725+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The previous shop let you see how much rp you were using and how much you would get back, i tried to use it to see how much i would have left but it went straight away.\n\nThanks for the link man","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Unknown101","date":"2016-05-19T09:03:00.827+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Have you tried the refund button in the shop. Go to the shop and over the right hand side there is RP purchase Gifting center and Account.\nGo to Account and on the left there will be a Purchase History tab click on that. This should bring up your history of your purchases and on the right there should be a refund button hopefully this will get your RP back.\n\nHope this helped.","replies":[{"poster":"Korth xev28","date":"2016-05-19T09:36:17.652+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thanks but my refunds were wasted in stupid things\n\nThanks anyways","replies":[]}]}]}]}
