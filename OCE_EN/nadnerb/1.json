We&#039;ve had 3 days for a while now, and whilst it&#039;s been good, the queue times don&#039;t seem to be that big at all? Implying a lot of people are playing? I find it odd that in from what I read, the main reason 3v3 isn&#039;t being extended is due to queue times, but whenever I try and do a Team Builder match, which is up more permanently than 3s, the queue time is ridiculously longer than any queue time I&#039;ve had to wait for a 3v3 match? What&#039;s the go?","replies":[{"poster":"Lord Sesshomaru","date":"2015-10-08T10:02:44.932+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I agree. they have said they are removing teambuilder, hopefully this means they might replace it with 3v3\n\nplease riot!","replies":[]}]}
