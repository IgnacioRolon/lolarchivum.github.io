I noticed there's a few more requirements and restrictions in this doc, so see if you might've missed one. If that fails, you can try filing a [support ticket](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/requests/new) and ask Player Support if they can do the gift for you or fix the issue you're having.","replies":[]}]}
