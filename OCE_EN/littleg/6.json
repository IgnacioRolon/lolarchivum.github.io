Riot is having a thing called figure fest where you can get to figure for the price of $30 instead of the regular $50. Sounds great right . Although you can only pick a pair of the figures shown below to get the sale. All this is fine but what really grinds my gears is that they also released  7 new figures. only 3 of which are if the selected group that you can pair and get the sale on. These 3 are heimerdonger, lulu and braum. In my opinion these are eprobaly the least wanted ones by the community. Why release 7 amazing new figures and only make the 3 &quot;worst&quot; ones compatible with the sale.
