If Ozhan has more than 5 stacks of &quot;Nerve&quot; the reveal effect will last the full 6 seconds anything less will only provide the effect for 3 seconds. Ozhan also receives 30% Attack speed upon activation.\r\n\r\nE: Scatter shot, Ozhan shoots out an arrow-like skillshot that will pierce all enemies it travels through and rebound off walls. Scatter shot can rebound 2 times.\r\n\r\nR: Dragon Strike, After a short channel Ozhan shoots an arrow sated with the spirit of the dragon. The arrow travels globally dealing a small amount of damage and slows EVERYTHING it passes through by 60%. Ozhan has 2 stacks of Dragon Strike but must use the seconds at least 4 seconds after the first has been cast.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nP.S I am bored, this is a joke... pls don&#039;t get your nickers in a twist about how this is just Hanzo&#039;s kit in LOL.","replies":[{"poster":"EzeBlood","date":"2016-08-27T08:16:26.528+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Ooh look its almost Hanzo","replies":[{"poster":"EzeBlood","date":"2016-08-27T08:16:48.944+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Read the PS after posting that lol","replies":[]}]}]}
