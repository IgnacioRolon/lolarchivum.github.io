If you don't get him, you are very lucky! I prefer the Heimidonger and gnar bundle, as they were the two I actually wanted! The urf one is Ok, but it's not my favourite, and I defiantly rather someone else over Gragas. \n\nIf you're buying this figure hoping for Vi or Leona, ones that are very popular, think again, as you are very likely to get the unpopular ones (Gragas, Katarina, Gankplank etc...)","replies":[]}]}
