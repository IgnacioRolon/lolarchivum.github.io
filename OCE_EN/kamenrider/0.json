I tried to go to my match history or other pages but it just show them. Also I tried to spectate my friends&#039; play but it won&#039;t connect to it. And today I can&#039;t even click the &#039;play&#039; button. Lastly, ever since yesterday when I play on my client the images glitches, such as last second my it seemed that my ability didn&#039;t hit anything and next second it shows that its been hit, or when I&#039;m walking my character just glitched and &#039;jumped&#039; to the next place. PLEASE TELL ME HOW TO FIX IT!!!","replies":[]}
