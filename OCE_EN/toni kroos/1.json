Or if you decide to dodge the lobby, you can take a  screen shot  of any evidence (chat logs and the champions they picked) and send it directly to [Riot Support](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/requests/new).\n\nHopefully with new client Riot will be able to make some much needed changes to lobby kicking and reporting, and end this kind of behaviour for good. But until then, what I outlined above is the best course of action ATM.\n\nI hope that helps :)","replies":[{"poster":"Toni Kroos","date":"2016-11-28T03:42:21.864+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thank you so much for the suggestion. i should screenshot if it happens again :/\nThank you again.","replies":[{"poster":"Tele","date":"2016-11-28T19:19:32.650+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'm glad I could help :D\n{{sticker:slayer-pantheon-thumbs}}","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Klavinmour","date":"2016-11-27T21:56:14.126+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Report them, without your consent they can't take your position away.\n\nThis was happening a lot when Dynamic queue first was released and everyone who got reported for it ended up with some sort of ban.\n\nUNLESS IF YOU REPORT PEOPLE FOR DOING SHIT, NOTHING WILL HAPPEN ABOUT IT.","replies":[{"poster":"Toni Kroos","date":"2016-11-28T03:49:23.253+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hello, thanks for reply.\nOf course, I report every game when i can't take my role. \nBut never get any feedback from riot(When somebody got punished, they usually notice me with a little msg window on the client).\nDoesn't it mean they didn't get any punishment?\nI feel so resentment.
