I&#039;ve had lots of issues trying to get this one, from having corrupt files and having to delete them, to receiving notifications telling me that riot is aware of the issue and are working on a fix. When i open league it says the latest patch needs to be downloaded and will automatically begin in dah dah dah, the next window comes up and it all goes fine untill it gets to 83.7MB and just stops, the window doesn&#039;t freeze. I&#039;ve closed and tried again but it just can&#039;t get past that spot.","replies":[{"poster":"SephirothSG","date":"2016-12-11T01:26:45.336+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey there,\n\nAre you still experiencing this issue?\n\nCould you try [forcing a repatch](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/202969434-Patching-Issues#wq4) for me, let me know if this helps.","replies":[]}]}
