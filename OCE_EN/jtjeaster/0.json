As a coach and someone who has had to scout for players I have come to find that there are very few ripe apples to pick from the apple tree on the OCE farm. That is why I have put pen to paper to come up with an idea that I&#039;m going to help players to improve so that we have a healthier competitive scene. If you are not serious and are not a person who puts effort in please stop reading here. This is for serious people only! Now lets get something straight so that you understand a coach and a mentor are two different things. A coach is someone who teaches, trains and tutors. A mentor is an advisor. So if you know becoming pro in league is something you want to do your best way of getting there is working through me. I know what teams are looking for and I know exactly how to get there all it takes is a very small amount of money and your effort and time. I don&#039;t want to go into any detail of what I do and how it works because that will be exposing the methods. I&#039;m keeping myself hidden for the moment so am not going to link a discord or anything because my new discord account is unknown aswell. But yeah add me on league and I&#039;ll give you the rundown. Also I want to add that the higher rank you are the easier it is for me to mentor so lower ranks may be a higher price but am happy to work around it. First 5 people that come to me I&#039;ll do the most of it free.","replies":[{"poster":"Best Evelynn OCE","date":"2018-03-18T23:47:13.737+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"I somehow doubt an OCS coach would be Bronze V 0 LP in Flex Queue... literally the queue that is all about teams","replies":[]},{"poster":"Rectum","date":"2018-03-18T09:06:18.529+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"So, post some examples of your past work? so far it all blind faith on what you are saying is the truth.","replies":[{"poster":"jtjeaster","date":"2018-03-18T09:12:53.073+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"Hi glad to hear your interest and can understand some players may be thinking the same thing. I am unfortunately wanting to make a new identity for myself so explaining my past helps people identify who I am. If you want to know more about me I can explain this more personally on league but am not sharing it to the public.","replies":[{"poster":"Rectum","date":"2018-03-18T09:42:30.514+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You do know people that talks to you can also leak it right?
