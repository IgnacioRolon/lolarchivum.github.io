You can't rely on third party sources so much because they can only estimate. Though, from those estimates, you were at the very very bottom of Plat; a lot of people lost a whole tier of MMR, so it's not surprising if you lost just a little more and ended in Silver. To avoid this next time, you need to raise your MMR/Rank up more than just the bare minimum.\n\nBesides, you will be getting good LP gains, and if you're really Plat level you'll climb up fast. You can be there in no time flat.","replies":[]}]}
