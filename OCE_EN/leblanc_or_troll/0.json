And all they get out of it is the knowledge that that person appreciates it? Smh at your post. People have jobs, small jobs in some cases which are paying the bills or saving towards something big. In what world is someone just gonna casually hand off 10 or more dollars to a stranger when they ask for it on the internet?\n\nWe also have no guarantee that YOU will get the RP even if we were stupid enough to give away money at no benefit. Someone else could come along and put in the code before you check it, as you haven't included any contact details to tell you the code. You would honestly have more luck calling Donald Trump, a rich man with money burning in his fireplace, than the randoms of Oceania. \n\nOf course even if someone has a lot of money so spare, they are gonna need more than your appreciation to just giveaway $10. People would rather have RP just sitting on their account ready for a deal than hand it over to a complete stranger. Heck even people quitting the game would rather keep their code than give it to a random.\n\nHonestly I'm curious as to if you have actually visited a scam website and tried it, because you seem like the kinda person who would. Just steal your mum's wallet or something and stop with the pestering here.","replies":[]},{"poster":"bonjwa1","date":"2016-04-17T04:48:25.097+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"same","replies":[]}]}
