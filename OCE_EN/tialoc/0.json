I think it should be, being a mentor requires you to be lvl30 and earns you mentor score whenever your introduced players hit lvl30, this number is arbitrary and is only used to show off, maybe at a certain mentor score (say 20 introduced players) you get a 'mentor icon'. For introduced players on their starting account, they get an IP boost for the first few games by registering a mentor before they hit lvl5. This should help them work towards buying their first champion.\n\nThe mentor icon would be a rare and coveted icon by much of the player base and would encourage players to try to involve their friends in the game. It could also be used to secretly check for people who run botting programs since the mentor system would link botted accounts to the main if they decided they wanted the mentor icon on their main.","replies":[{"poster":"Project Xayah","date":"2017-03-23T05:07:41.660+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I have to agree with this.\n\nThat said, such a system would be easily abuse-able in the sense of smurf accounts. Basically anyone could make and level a bunch of \"throwaway\" accounts to get all the goodies they want. Such a system would only work if Riot actively did something to prevent people using smurfs to abuse the system.","replies":[{"poster":"Tialoc","date":"2017-03-23T16:04:31.095+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Like i said, to prevent major abuse of it, tone it back a bit and put a limit on how many recruits people can have, say 2 per account per year or something.","replies":[{"poster":"Project Xayah","date":"2017-03-24T00:24:01.944+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Honestly, I think it would be better if Riot use the supposed \"smurf detection systems\" they have in place to impose restrictions on smurf accounts with things like this. Let the main accounts have free reign and just make sure that smurfs can neither benefit from the system or allow someone else to benefit from it. That way it's more incentive for people to follow the rules, as they'll permanently lose any progress in the \"mentor\" system if they get banned, and people shouldn't be able to abuse the system by spamming \"throwaway\" accounts.\n\nFrom what Riot's told the community (going back to their claims of smurf detection systems), there's no reason to hard limit any one player's access to the system.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Tialoc","date":"2017-03-23T04:22:44.650+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I can agree that it needs to be toned back a fair bit, it was just a rough idea, what you've said is pretty good though, hopefully riot sees","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"FatedSaviour","date":"2017-03-23T02:07:10.295+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"uuh, no","replies":[]}]}
