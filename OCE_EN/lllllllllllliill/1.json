Catalyst Coaching recruiting!","subforum":"Community Events","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"# **WE ARE CLOSED FOR APPLICATIONS!! :< Don't worry we'll be recruiting at least once a month! Keep an eye out! :)**#\n\nCatalyst Coaching is currently open for recruitment. We are a **FREE &amp; VOLUNTARY** coaching service/school. We have 13-15 slots free and are accepting the following regions (in order of priority):\n\nEUW /EUNE/OCE &gt; NA/LAS/LAN &gt; OTHER (we accept ALL regions)\n\nThe majority of our coaching is done in English so we prefer if you can speak English to a reasonable level (nothing special as long as you can understand mainly!). We can cater for German/Spanish speakers too.\n\nFeel free to apply regardless of region as we do keep an eye out for exceptional applications.\n\nMoving on!\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n**About Us**\n\n- We offer long-term 1 on 1 coaching. We are a few months old OFFICIALLY and currently have 15 coaches (high-plat to diamond - 1 ex-masters) &amp; 37 active students from **all over the world!**. We are currently recruiting for more padawans. We are VERY organized and VERY thorough with our coaching regime as you&#039;ll read below\n\n- Since March we have kept track and found that whilst with us students have ranked up a combined total of 83 divisions and 19 tiers! Average division gain per rank *so far*: Bronze (2.1), Silver (2.2), Gold (1.6). This is long-term coaching so we&#039;re expecting way more with time!\n\n- No website yet BUT we do use a network on excel sheets to monitor everything (templates below for you to browse at your pleasure). YOU would be given your own profile to manage and check daily. \n\n- It is long-term coaching so absences/holidays/exams etc are expected and is fine as long as they are communicated with us!\n\n- We offer a one hour session regularly every week (2 if you are well behaved!) that is mandatory for you to book &amp; attend. A session can be a general coaching chat, replay analysis (most commonly), duoQ or whichever format we feel best suited for you at the time. We also have 28 day reviews where we go over the past 4 weeks and make any bigger changes if necessary.\n\n- We also have a dedicated discord server that is active 24/7 since we accept students from ALL regions. ALL bookings are made through our discord booking channel + it&#039;s a great place to mingle with your like minded peers &amp; coaches and even take part in some in-house 5&#039;s!\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**About You**\n\n- Be 17+ y/o preferably (if you are younger you can still apply but be honest! We are looking for mature minded students!)\n\n- Be lvl 30 Unranked/Bronze/Silver/Gold \n\n- Be willing to follow our regime - coaches put in over 100 hours each week combined so while this may seem a lot for you it really isn&#039;t compared. To improve does take above-average commitment like any other hobby):\n\n- Mandatory Regime as follows:\n\n1.  You manage your profile and check it daily\n\n2.  You stick to a condensed champion pool 3 minimum 6 max (we are reasonable people - changes are OK as long as they are infrequent)\n\n3.  You play a minimum of 10 ranked games a week (sorry we are not accepting part-timers/casuals)\n\n4.  You sign up to the replay sites we recommend (replay.gg/aof.gg) &amp; are responsible for booking your weekly session (extra is possible just depends on availability)\n\n5.  You join our dedicated discord server\n\n6.  Communicate as much as you can - about champion pool changes, role changes, absences, issues, suggestions you name it!\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n# **Catalyst TOUR/Templates** #\n\n\n**- Template of a student profile (check tabs at the bottom):**\nhttps://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Ui2ae3VNsT8nP9GeI96N4nB7x1kb6HiASne9t2JUJyM/edit?usp=sharing\n\n**- Template of our overview &amp; bookings excel (check tabs at the bottom):** \nhttps://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1EFbsp_QUdLMX_Y5RDdboAaF6wkke2oFP4SC2iTpSPVU/edit?usp=sharing\n\n**- Read about our coaches (names removed for privacy reasons):**\nhttps://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1EFbsp_QUdLMX_Y5RDdboAaF6wkke2oFP4SC2iTpSPVU/edit#gid=1615608986\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\nIf you like the above we are more than happy to give you more in-depth info as you apply!\n\n# How to Apply #\n\n\n1.
