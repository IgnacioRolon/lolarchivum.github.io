I mean, they are already hard to hit and catch because they're ranged, but when this item itself has an active **that also slows the *ENEMY?***, that my friends is the real kicker.\n\nThe only downside is the Ap. Or is it?! lets take a look at the ~~adc~~ Marksman page in the client.\nhttp://vvcap.net/db/kKFSyX5261PJzlEbFOXC.htp\n\nNow, of all the champions shown here, lets count how many have AP Ratios in their kit.\n13! 13 out of 19! That's full blown ridiculous if you ask me.\n\nI'm sorry for bringing awareness to this but it needs to be changed and nerfed asap, I can't handle versing another Teemo Tristana botlane running double spooky ghosts, it's too horrifying.\n\nPetition to have {{item:3023}} **nerfed**, thanks Riot, thank you so much.\n\n**And before all you super low elo warriors comment, you must read this disclosure from a benevolent friend of mine;**\n*Low elos should learn to stop back talking diamond 1s or higher. If someone from bronze has an opinion that differs from a diamond 1's, the bronzie should NOT try to reason with the high elo. He shouldn't ask why either. He should take what the diamond says as fact without talking back. Too many times, I've seen a bronzie backtalk a diamond 1, and it's disgusting, because the bronzie is wrong most of the time. The only time a bronzie is right is when 500,000 bronzies are talking back to a single diamond 1. There's a reason why you're stuck in bronze. It's because you think differently than the diamonds. Start thinking like a diamond.*\n\n*God bless overlord Dynasty Ahri.* {{champion:103}}","replies":[{"poster":"Jack","date":"2014-11-26T10:07:56.207+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":1,"body":"Thanks for this, I've been encountering this so much and it's putrid, thanks.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Garens Harem","date":"2014-11-26T10:46:06.332+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"can confirm this item is op \n\ni versed a b5 noob yesterday using twin shadows and couldn't kill him wtf\n\ni am a higher rank then him, therefore i should beat him but this item so op he win against \n\nfix ur system riot","replies":[]},{"poster":"Dynasty Ahri","date":"2014-11-26T10:21:57.593+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":1,"body":"No backtalk.","replies":[]},{"poster":"RUSTYtheCASTER","date":"2014-11-27T05:11:13.945+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'm assuming this is completely troll, if not i apologise for being rude :p. \nI'd like to point out the obvious answer to this post though.. \nZephyr.
