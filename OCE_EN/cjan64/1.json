Sorry if the structure is a bit off.] The All Random URF Game Mode has some notable flaws.  The AR seems unfair as you could get a champion like {{champion:6}} or {{champion:238}}. Or you could get {{champion:157}} and be almost useless due to his q and e having CD dependent on level and attack speed, Not CDR. There should at least be something where you pick a select champion pool you would like to play and then have it randomize there.\nI don't know how but there could be some changes made to the All Random URF Game Mode.","replies":[{"poster":"ChezyboiNA","date":"2016-09-25T00:36:59.246+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"more pressingly it's 1:36 and it's still not live!","replies":[{"poster":"Omni Presents","date":"2016-09-25T00:40:13.682+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yeh I was wondering that.
