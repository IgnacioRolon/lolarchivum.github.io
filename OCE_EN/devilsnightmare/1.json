I have the pass and i struggle to get revel tokens.  I think we all know that league of legends has people playing at a young age and those people would probably be going to school. Here is the problem. Students would want to get as much coins for the Prestige vayne skin or even the other things u can get with the revel coins. Although, students also has to dedicate a lot of time to school work as it is very important for our future lives. This is hard to balance as you guys would think. People would want to grind for this but some students may only be able to play during weekends or have a only a few hours a week. I my self is a year 10 student who loves league of legends and would play all the time. I&rsquo;d say you guys would too. But school also blocks us. Some people love the game that much that it interrupts with their school work, putting them behind. So all i ask is this, can you guys please vote.  We need more ways to gain these tokens. We need more missions to gain these tokens. And even if you aren&rsquo;t a student or you have no problem with this. Please think about the other people in this world who is already struggling with balancing their school work with league. \r\n\r\nCheers, see you at the rift\r\n\r\nDevilsNightMare","replies":[]}
