(around) that and the enemy team surrenders or one of my teammates feed and therefore the enemy they fed is the one that kills me. i desperately need help. The last game i played i went 13/2/5, most dmg in game, 22 vision score, 2 - 4 objectives, and 116 cs and THEY SURRENDER( 23 min )!!! All i need is just 1 Singular S so i can get mastery 7! i've been tilted all day so any help would be helpful. \r\n\r\n{{sticker:slayer-jinx-wink}}","replies":[{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2019-03-23T13:34:08.517+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"CS. You seem to be aware that KD isn't the only thing counted, but CS is worth a lot more than people realise. If you're looking for S ranks you should be aiming for at least 8CS per min or 160 at 20 minutes. Ideally, you'd be pushing for 10 (200). \n\nADC scores are also very polarising, tending to be very high or very low. Especially as a hyper carry like Vayne, the S rank scores are going to be higher numerically than on a lot of other champs.","replies":[{"poster":"DevilsNightMare","date":"2019-03-24T04:15:05.087+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Ok, Riot hates me. just played a league game and went 18/7/7, 205 cs, 35.9k dmg, 21 vision score, 2 - 3 objectives and with a cho gath who died in the first 2 min and dc.

Remember that those ranks are based on other players on that champ in that position. You have to be hitting the top 2%~ of scores to get that S rank, and on hyper carries that gets exponentially harder. Game time will work against you, and so will every death.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"DevilsNightMare","date":"2019-03-24T01:18:53.362+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"right! that's true. alright, thanks for the advice {{sticker:slayer-pantheon-thumbs}}","replies":[]}]}]}
