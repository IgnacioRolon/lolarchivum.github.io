Usually, my game will run between 300-400FPS uncapped at max settings with anti-alias enabled but lately it has been unplayable reaching lows of around 2-15FPS. \r\n\r\nI have noticed that when I disabled sound however that my FPS remains stable. Playing with sound is horrible though as you can't hear anything important in the game (pings, spell casts, dragon etc). \r\n\r\nIs this a common problem? It has been impossible to play lately and I would like to know if there is a fix to this. Thanks in advance.","replies":[{"poster":"Braum Is Here","date":"2015-03-13T14:40:37.513+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I have the same problem :(","replies":[]},{"poster":"HORSE OF FORCE","date":"2015-03-09T05:59:43.312+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"This has been a consistent problem since the update of Summoner's Rift. It may be something that was completely unrelated to the map, though they just happen to coincide.\n\nThere may be some things you can try, though. Have you recently updated your graphics drivers?","replies":[]}]}
