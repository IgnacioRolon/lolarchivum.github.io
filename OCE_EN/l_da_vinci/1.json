I dont think that is fair that people can troll , and we cant report them because who wants to even play a game with someone who doesnt want to play properly ?","replies":[{"poster":"Tele","date":"2017-06-27T04:08:59.223+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"The penalty isn't really there to stop trolls, it's there to stop people from dodging legitimate teams until they get a team they really like. That said I think you're right, a few free dodges or some kind of system to deal with trolls is needed. It's a pretty bad system where people are being punished for doing the responsible thing and avoiding trolls.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Sp1rit Rush","date":"2017-06-27T06:24:35.939+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"^ Then dont 1 trick, You have no right to complain if you have a champ pool of 1. \n\nI agree with the OP how ever, Sona JG, Yasuo support are all troll picks in my mind, I dont think we should lose the LP, Maybe 1 free dodge a day? Wouldnt be so bad","replies":[]},{"poster":"Akkordian Zoeve","date":"2017-06-27T04:52:56.050+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"But Soraka/Blitz Mid can work if the player is experienced playing them that way.\n\nBut I agree. There should be some leniency. I'm a one-trick, but because (after the 2nd+ time) I lose 10 LP and have a 30 minute ban whenever I dodge when I don't get Evelynn Jungle, I'm stuck playing in a role and champion I neither like nor am good at. And hence I lose.","replies":[]}]}
