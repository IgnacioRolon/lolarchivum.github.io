I try so hard when I play ranked and I know the basics. (Warding, CSing, Aiming the ADC or Carry) but I always get a troll in my game. How can I definitely win my next two games? Or at least, have a higher percentage of winning? I&#039;m sick and tired of trolls ruining my placement matches after the time it took to buy runes, set masteries, get to level 30. The league OCE community is pretty horrible. :L","replies":[{"poster":"Vapid","date":"2015-04-28T02:06:55.358+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"If you don't like the look of your game lobby, eg. someone wants to jungle Sona, you can dodge it without penalty to your placement matches.\nYou could also find a duo partner you know isn't going to try and 1v5 whenever he gets a chance or continue to fight a lane opponent after being down 0/3.\n\nAlthough the general mentality of everyone in soloqueue is \"I can't climb because of trolls\", the reality is everyone is in the same boat, we all play with those trolls and yet plenty of people progress up the ladder. My advice is win your lane, get those objectives after your kills, stick to your fundamentals and try and influence the other lanes once you get a head. If you're behind and your other lanes are doing fine then it's on you to play safer and effectively just be \"carryable\" later on.\n\nAt the end of the day though your placements are only 10 games in a very long season, don't stress too much about your rank and where you might end up, just play your game and look for things you can improve on in every game. For example some games I'll tell myself \"Ok this game I'm going to try and slaughter my lane opponent in CS\" or \"This game I'm not going to die to any ganks because I'll ward effectively and keep an eye on the map\". Good luck!","replies":[{"poster":"Ward on Bush","date":"2015-05-06T09:26:58.209+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thank you so much! I never knew that you don't get punished for dodging q during placement matches. That helps a lot! Thanks :)","replies":[{"poster":"HORSE OF FORCE","date":"2015-05-09T07:28:33.896+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Well, if you do it enough, you will get a low priority queue. Also, if you do it during promotions, it will count as a loss automatically.\n\nThe reason you don't get punished straight away is because Riot don't expect everyone to have a perfect connection at all times, and it's designed to have leeway for people who disconnect due to reasons out of their control. If you dodge-queue, you're abusing this, encouraging Riot to make Leaverbuster more strict, and that is something no-one wants.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"HORSE OF FORCE","date":"2015-04-29T10:34:42.983+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":">How can I definitely win my next two games?\n\nIf everyone could do that, then what would the point of playing be? The enemy wouldn't have any control over the outcome of the game, so they'd just quit/report you.\n\n>Or at least, have a higher percentage of winning?\n\nThat's more reasonable. For this general topic, you might want to head over to [Gameplay & Strategy](http://boards.oce.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/gameplay-strategy).\n\nAlso, it is suggested that you have at least two-hundred normal wins before attempting ranked. How many do you have right now?","replies":[]}]}
