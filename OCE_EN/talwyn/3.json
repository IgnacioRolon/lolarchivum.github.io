I am part of a gaming organization and we are looking for a new logo. If it is possible, we would love for someone from OCE to create our logo. We are willing to pay a price through PayPal or through skins depending on the quality of the logo. We are looking to pay between $50 - $100. If you are interested send me a message (either through pm, league, or in reply to this post) and we will give you more information about what we want included. Thank you for reading this and good luck to anyone who creates one! \r\n\r\nYours sincerely,\r\nTalwyn","replies":[]}
