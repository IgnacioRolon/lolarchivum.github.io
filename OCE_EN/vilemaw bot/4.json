Especially when you throw in mounting dread which deals a flat amount +5% of targets maximum health also you are essentially dealing over 1/4 of the targets health no matter who they are within the first 3 AA's and due to the Attack speed sitting at around 2.05 after runaans hurricane it chews through them so ridiculously fast. I can peel down high HP opponents and Carry's in seconds. Played kindred ARAM with this build using deaths dance and had a full health gragas at our nexus towers, I chewed him down and killed him in under 2 seconds solo. \nAdd in deaths dance for more sustain and more damage or either Lord Doms or Mortal reminder for even more chew down if they have some annoying tanks like a fed nasus.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Jink","date":"2015-10-14T16:44:21.711+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I was actually thinking youmuus rush after devourer then mallet and botrk.

She actually does excel in adc role, she has easy sustain (is she does it mobile (constantly moving between attacks(like yasuo should do to charge his passive))) q mobility to dodge skillshots like hooks, a slow (which benefits in lane more to be maxed b4 q due to slow and burst) and an ult that saves her and her allies (not enemies) is positioned properly.\n\nAlso, just mark enemy kindred if they do jg for easy stacks, a jg kindred has a very very slow power spike compered to adc kindred","replies":[]},{"poster":"Knuuckles","date":"2015-10-14T23:33:47.186+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Don't devourer it's bad, I don't find mallet that good on her, pretty much rush warrior Bork and triforce and you should be good, depending on how your going will depend on what you build next but movespeed and lifesteal are best suited to kindred","replies":[]},{"poster":"Olee","date":"2015-10-14T11:11:28.627+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I see people building him like Zed and going really well, I've heard Devourer sucks on him.\n\n{{item:3723}} {{item:3006}} {{item:3153}} {{item:3142}} {{item:3035}} and then idk","replies":[{"poster":"DragonOfTheVoid","date":"2015-10-14T13:45:04.972+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"sated sucks on all ranged champ how stupid are some of you","replies":[{"poster":"Azirious Mistake","date":"2015-10-14T20:25:59.192+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Please mind this man, he is salty.","replies":[{"poster":"Olee","date":"2015-10-14T22:28:36.217+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"lol I can see that.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Olee","date":"2015-10-14T22:28:31.040+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I don't jungle. lol.","replies":[]}]}]}]}
