I love Malzahar {{champion:90}} and play him a lot. Here is a list of bugs I have compiled.\r\n\r\n1. If you die with 3 voidling stacks and then die. When you cast another spell, it resets to 0 even though the stacks are still there.\r\n2. If you put visions on Sion when he dies, it won't jump to another target\r\n3. When ult'ing, it takes a little bit before they get rooted in place. This allows them to cast spells, auto attack and other things sending the ult on cooldown.\r\n4. Minions derping (I can be auto attacking a target and the minion will just be AFK beside me)\r\n5. Putting visions on the very last moment before a target dies, the ability will go on cooldown without jumping to another target.\r\n6. There is also a bug with his passive, where if you die while passive being up (next spell spawns creep), then you have the \"thing\" underneath you the whole game.\r\n7. If you have Visions on a champion and another visions on a minion, if the minion dies, it doesn't renew the visions. \r\n\r\nIf you have more Malzahar bugs, please post them.","replies":[{"poster":"Gummyjacob","date":"2015-01-03T07:03:07.740+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Malzahar's ulti doesn't go well with zhonyas.

I'm not kidding his ult gets interrupted by any and all things and I got sick of it. But yeah the ult suppression should be instantaneous, such as Warwicks ultimate, because that .5 seconds of spell/attack castability can save lives.\n\nEDIT: This isn't the optimal place for reporting bugs either friend, I'm pretty sure there is a proper board for reporting bugs, let me check.\n\nAhh yes there is one but it is integrated with NA, here it is: http://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/bug-report","replies":[]}]}
