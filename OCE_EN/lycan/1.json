The best example for this is between Guinsoo&#039;s Rageblade and Blade of the Ruined King. \r\nBOTH state that basic attacks have an effect. However, if you have a Runaan&#039;s Hurricane {{item:3085}} , only the passive from the BotRK {{item:3153}} applies to the extra bolts and NOT the Guinsoo&#039;s Rageblade&#039;s {{item:3124}} &quot;Guinsoo&#039;s Rage&quot; passive. This is very confusing. \r\n\r\nThere are other examples, like Spell Vamp not working with Teemo&#039;s Toxic shot, but works with Jax&#039;s Ult. \r\n\r\nThanks,\r\nLycan","replies":[{"poster":"Infinity Boy","date":"2015-12-21T01:55:13.711+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Agreed.
