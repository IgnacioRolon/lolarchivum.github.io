It's inevitable that you'll lose some games which were just out of your control. If you never lost a game, then what would the point be in playing?\n\n>What have i done wrong to have these players who feed every single game.\n\nIt can seem like that at times, but the way the MMR system works ensures that you're matched with players roughly of your skill-level. The only way to subvert this is if you were always using a premade, in which case it becomes a personal matter.\n\n>even after i go 4/0 by the end of laning phase.\n\nScore is not everything. It only indicates how strong *your* character is, not every other player on your team (which constitutes 4/5 of it).\n\nIf you find yoursellf with a lead and your team-mates falling behind, try to help them get their lead back. Stick around them and kill the enemies who come in for the kill. If it's well past the laning phase and it's really only team-fights, then you can play a good split-pushing champ and split-push your way to victory, while your team is losing a significant battle.\n\nFor more gameplay and strategy tips, head on over to the [Gameplay & Strategy](http://boards.oce.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/gameplay-strategy) boards.","replies":[]}]}
