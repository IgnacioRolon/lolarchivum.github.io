Didnt get explanation why either.","subforum":"Player Behaviour","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"So four months ago i stopped playing league for a while, you know, to clear my head and be as much as positive as i can be. Yesterday i tried to log in and play couple of games, to see what changed bout the game, when suddenly a message popped up saying my account was permamently suspended. I got really confused, because this was my first time ever an account of mine is getting perma ban. The message said that there will be an expanation why i was banned at my email adress. Went there, checked every &quot;Riot Games&quot; named mail, but didnt found anything related to this case. I really dont know what i was banned for, but i can say that i was a very positive person really. Never got upset without a actual reason. Played the game for fun. Yea you read that right xD. I put a lot of effort in the game. That was my first time i got really into a game. Created my account back at 2015 and played it ever since. Anticipated in every event (The Bilgewater one was my favorite :D) and overall had lot of fun, and i still do. This is my only account which i am fully dedicated to, and to be taken away from me is a pretty bad experience. If i really go banned forever, at least i need some explanation why. I can tell everything about the account. Dates, email, in game screenshots, riot points reciepts (lot of them) and everything you guys need. Please, i need someone&#039;s help on this.\r\n\r\nYours sincerely,\r\n\r\nPowRevAce","replies":[{"poster":"IngÃ©nue","date":"2017-10-03T00:00:59.683+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"If you didn't receive an email with details of your ban, be sure to [send a support ticket](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/requests/new) in and you can discuss your case with an agent. \nUnfortunately due to this being an account specific inquiry we are unable to help you further on the boards. \n\nWhen submitting a ticket follow the following guidelines to ensure the quickest and smoothest experience:\n\n>Please create a max of 1 ticket about this issue, and do not try to add any information afterwards/submit multiple as it will bump it to the back of the queue.
