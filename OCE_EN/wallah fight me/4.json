I started a youtube channel a couple days ago and I&#039;m doing a giveaway to boost my subscribers. Right now, i am giving a 10 dollar league card away. To enter, you have to like the Giveaway video, comment your league name and server and subscribe. If i hit 50 or 100 subscribers by Wednesday (when the giveaway starts) I will increase the amount of the league card (50 subs = 25 dollar league card, 100 subs = 50 dollar league card). Please subscribe and share so we can hit as many subscriptions as possible.

As i have a Mac, I'm limited to recording softwares but, soon i will be getting Camtasia. Im not very entertaining when I use my voice in recording, because i don't know what to say and they just get bored. And yeh, I'm going to delete that Vi and Quinn video, i don't think it deserves to be on my channel :P","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"See you in D5","date":"2016-01-11T02:07:19.965+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"What is this, 2008?
