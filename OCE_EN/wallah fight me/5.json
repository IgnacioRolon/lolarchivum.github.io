By the time i get to get into queue again, my free time is up.\r\nBring back the option to have legacy, if you want to use the new client then woopty doo go for your fucking life.\r\nThe new client is shit, thats all there is to say, its pure fucking garbage\r\nYeh im salty rn, because i just lost 6 lp for no reason and Ive had to wait 35 minutes to play 1 game, maybe it will still fuck up next champ select too\r\n\r\nBring back legacy","replies":[{"poster":"Mortis Ex","date":"2017-04-29T08:17:16.796+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I have NBN and a good pc, gen <20ms and can play modded fallout4 with all settings maxed 60+ fps. New client is terrible, buggy, slow, lags out. As OP said, I have \"dodged\" quite a few games since the update due to \"error selecting champ\" bug. You click on the champ, client does nothing for 5+ seconds then an error pops up and you have to close it and then try selecting champ again. On a huge, almost empty page, they have a tiny icon for first win of the day that you have to hover to get timer where the old client had it clearly visible. Unless I just havent found it yet, the old summary of champions in the ranked ladder page is gone, now you only get your top 5 and the stats are only the very most basic games played and win% where is used to have damage per game, towers, cs etc for each champion and each season. \nAlso I had to redo all of my settings, sound levels, language filter etc. The options page at least has an option to stop the annoying notifications for esports (which should be opt in not opt out) but no further options like turn off invites from people who are not your friend, which is a whole issue on its own, why the fk does it not show you any fricken details about the person who has invited when they arent on your friends list and you cant stop them from spamming invites over and over and over when they arent even you friend in the first goddamn place.","replies":[{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2017-04-29T10:48:19.269+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"PERMISSIONS: https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/204134104-Setting-up-your-Permissions\n\nCONNECTION: https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Fitzky","date":"2017-04-29T09:25:14.410+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I use a crappy laptop and it runs completely fine, what's your excuse now?","replies":[{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2017-04-29T10:47:12.476+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Usually an unstable install.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2017-04-23T05:41:39.290+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Enable Low Spec mode in the client settings. If you're getting error messages then run a repair. The new client uses more resources than the old client yes, but that is the purpose of Low Spec mode.
