If I impart on you a pearl of wisdom should you ever need it, when playing against Illaoi and you get marked as a vessel, its usually better to stand under a tentacle until the effect ends and leave it be, because a tentacle will only attack a vessel once in 10 seconds, but if you destroy one, another tentacle will spawn and instantly attack you.","replies":[]}]}
