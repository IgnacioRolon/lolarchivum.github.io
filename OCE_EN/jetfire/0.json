We're working on a fix so that you actually log out when you, y'know, log out. Right now, the mobile status will go away after about a day (so don't worry, you're not stuck forever) but we know that's not what's expected.","replies":[{"poster":"Thirtz","date":"2016-06-04T23:55:17.161+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Umm, nope. I uninstalled both the beta and the release versions of the app on my android phone because it was annoying my friends that I was perpetually \"online\" in their friends list but actually only in \"mobile\" mode. I uninstalled them 3 days ago and apparently I still appear in their list as \"mobile\". Please fix this. It's caused me to stop using the app. I totally understand where they are coming from, as I have about 3 people in my list always online (mobile) that I just do not want to see unless we are conversing.

If you **log out** of the app you will instantly appear offline. If you simply uninstalled the app, you'll remain mobile until you decay to \"offline\" (usually takes about 2 weeks).","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Jetfire","date":"2016-02-26T05:26:42.500+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Haha sounds fair!!
