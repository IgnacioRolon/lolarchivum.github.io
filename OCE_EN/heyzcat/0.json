You really ban the people ruining this game?","subforum":"Player Behaviour","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"I have played this game 5 years, and it also brings me much fun. I play this game for having fun, for relaxing,  like most people, not getting myself mad. I know that there are many  troll this game. That kind of people always do bad in this game, but they  like to blame someone to abreact their unhappiness. I rarely speak in this game except necessary communication for assist, even my teammates do really bad as long they are not intentional( coz everyone does bad sometimes).  However, I got banned in one game, I was jg, I got invaded, mid was killed by  opposite solely. He began to blame me, began to troll, I tolerate his first two two sentences, but such people would never let u go. I returned fire. Then I got banned.\r\n\r\nI want to ask here, I got banned, a man always tolerate and rarely speak , those troll and keeping blaming are still active,  is this your way to do things, roit\r\n? Just judge by machine, by who got more number of report? What if they play in double, triple, quad? Troll team?\r\n\r\ntrolls play in triple and quad, after they troll someone they want to blame, then they report that guy who will be banned, is this your way, justified way to do things?\r\n\r\nwell, if this game treat me in an unfair way, i got to abandon it of course.\r\nI got banned because of troll, that&#039;s funny and irony, this is how society works, bad guys always live better than guys following rules.\r\nbye, 5 years, but it&#039;s indeed a pity I will leave with bad memory about this game.","replies":[{"poster":"Essembie","date":"2018-02-03T07:46:18.136+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"After playing with only one incident since ~2009 (got a chat ban in ~2015-16 - cant remember the year) I got an automated 14 dayer and some bad attitude from player behaviour who agreed that the ban was definitely out of context but upheld the suspension.\n\nQuit for 3 months. Came back for a few weeks but the fun has gone for me so I have recently uninstalled again. \n\nMight come back one day. Might not. But either way, the change in customer care and player support since about August last year has really lowered my opinion of the game and some of the people behind it. And the shift to loot boxes after being such a fantastic model of FTP done SOO SO right for nearly a decade was a very sad day. Used to jump at the chance to throw money at this game but with the change of delivery model towards something that is known to be exploitative has really turned me off. Greed is not good - ever since the founders handed the reigns over to accountants looking for a return on their investment, the heart has been ripped out of LoL for me.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2018-01-26T14:19:35.566+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":2,"body":"I'll try to keep it simple because the punishment system can be a lot to understand.\n\nNumber of reports does not matter, only validity. Reports trigger a review of the behaviour in that game, not the punishment, so a false report does nothing.\n\nYou being punished, does not mean that they weren't. There is a notification to tell you if your report has contributed to a punishment, but it's unreliable and very limited in when it shows, so not seeing it doesn't mean noone was punished.\n\nChat is a lot easier to punish on a large scale than in game behaviour is. To automation, negative chat (of the generic variety) is a lot easier to interpret than behaviour that could be intent feeding, or just someone having a really bad game, could be trolling, or could just be someone who has no idea what they're doing. What this means is that while both behaviours are punished, chat is punished in a more appropriate amount of time, where in game behaviour can take a lot longer to be detected and actioned. It's not great, but it is what it is.\n\nIt doesn't matter who started it. You are judged on your own behaviour. If someone was toxic to you, it sucks, but you being toxic back makes you just as bad as them. I don't know what specifically applies here, but if you want community feedback on your punishment, it's always recommended you post your chat logs.\n\nWhat kind of ban did you receive? Typically a first punishment is a 10 game chat restriction, which is in essence a warning that your behaviour is starting to cross the line. If you were escalated straight to a 14 day ban, it's usually because hate speech/suicide encouragement or some in game offence was involved. If you've had punishments in the past then your previous reform cards would have told you that continued negative behaviour would escalate your punishments.","replies":[{"poster":"CooMing","date":"2018-01-27T09:05:04.207+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"I personally think that because of speech on a person can make the punishment but the permanent ban is too much, we have freedom of speech and speech is a way we published personal emotion is a kind of communication, negative speech is negative people in an expression of power. LOL is considered as the two aspects of game and competition. It needs communication and communication between teams, but not everyone in the world is reasonable, and not all players understand how to play this game. A high-level player must have the desire to win, but because the matching mechanism problems will inevitably encounter many bad games, his teammates might have some problems. The excesses of speech come from the game, if you need to find a root to the who the wrong reasons, but also from the game to review, for the fist, only through language to ban a person's account is a very simple and indiscreet way to deal with problems.\nYou said that no matter who started it only judged on the individual behavior, which itself is an excuse to avoid deeper scrutiny. Everything has both positive and negative affect. The honor system is a good start, but this setting can't compete against the negative effects caused by the report. There are a lot of reasons, not every teammate will give honor to those players who deserved an honor. So considering all these factors, I want to say is to ban an account only by one game of speech, it is too simple and too violent, this player spent 5 years in this game, there have been hundreds of thousands of games, he must also bring another player with happy game experience,\nWhy does Riot deny all of him according to one game? Isn't this a huge problem in the system itself? If it is a real social problem, can you negate all of him because of his words while he is angry ï¼Ÿ Then why should those who intentionally feed did not get more serious punishments? If a victory is not a result of a key game, what are we fighting for and what we are trying to do in the same game with a group of people who do not know?","replies":[{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2018-01-27T11:59:14.642+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"We don't know he was perma banned, he only mentioned a ban, which could just as easily refer to a chat ban (the lowest punishment tier). It's also worth noting that while we have freedom of speech, that doesn't mean we have freedom from consequence. Riot chooses to make the consequence of being an ass restriction from the game in one manner or another. They have the right to do that, just as we have the right to say we don't like it and take our time elsewhere.\n\nFreedom of speech also doesn't protect hate speech and hasn't for a very long time.\n\nIt doesn't matter who started it because both will be judged on their behaviour. Little Timmy throwing a rock and Bob on the playground doesn't mean that Bob throwing a rock back is ok.\n\nGameplay offences skip you straight to a 14 day ban (one step before permanent), while chat offences typically get two chat restrictions before that. Gameplay offences like intentionally feeding are punished harsher, just slower because of the limitations of the system. It's not ideal, but not being able to punish one behaviour instantly shouldn't mean that other behaviours are ignored.","replies":[{"poster":"CooMing","date":"2018-01-27T12:34:55.314+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"You are right but I just told that is not good that can do better. In fact chat offences can lead to permanent ban, I think this is not right and it can not make the game better sometimes it is also unfair, but just like u said if we don't like it we can spend our times on other things, but I guess it feels bad to giving up a game that has already played for years.

In my opinion, if a chat restriction isn't getting the message across then escalate it. You get plenty of warnings for toxicity before perma ban.

The system is way to slow to punish gameplay offences, even some of the more obvious intent feeders still get away with it for far longer than is ok. It does a pretty good job for chat but gameplay offences are definitely a weak point.","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"heyzcat","date":"2018-01-28T03:01:49.483+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"I assume you would fire back when  you hear someone insulting you with \"fk u...\" or something else while you are walking on streets, so would I.

Unfortunately, I can't tolerate. \n\nAnd, without those initiators, there wont be any argument in a game, I wont be banned neither.\n\nHowever, this is called self-defense in law, like defense when you are attacked by someone intentionally.\n\nOne man's behavior can be changed by other people, one player always following rules can also say bad words with troll players, then you say they are all bad.
