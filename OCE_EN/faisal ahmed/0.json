Riot Banning innocent players.","subforum":"Player Behaviour","up_votes":2,"down_votes":5,"body":"As far as the system is concerned (and it&#039;s the community that decides what&#039;s acceptable and not by what they choose to report), defending yourself is fine, but retaliation is not. This doesn&#039;t make any sense. The toxic players who are reporting him shouldn&#039;t get to decide what&#039;s acceptable and if anything aren&#039;t classed as members of our community anymore.\r\n\r\n-Yes, people should ignore/mute instead of retaliation, BUT retaliation is almost the same as defending yourself. It&#039;s sad how you&#039;re considering toxic players reports against innocent victims. Fueling a toxic player is your excuse for making the situation worse, the match is already ruined having the toxic person playing on the same rift in the first place. The fun is already over for everyone. The damage is done, him retaliating is only a result in the toxic community.\r\n\r\n-What i&#039;m trying to say is stop punishing the innocent it&#039;s only going to create more toxicity in the community. You think that you&#039;re solving it but you&#039;re actually fueling the fire even more. It&#039;s a domino effect, many players get pissed off being punished unfairly and then go on to being toxic trolls venting out their frustration on others, THEN the player victims of them retaliate = get a punishment, so on and so forth. {{champion:89}}  {{item:3190}}","replies":[{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2016-06-15T08:17:42.971+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":1,"body":"> retaliation is _**almost**_ the same as defending yourself\n\nThere is a somewhat grey line there I'll admit, but consider it this way: \n___\n**Player:** Stop fking feeding you trashlord.\n**You**: I'm not feeding/It's just a bad game/No/It's not intentional\n\nAny variation there of is fine, you are defending yourself. It isn't going to help you any, they aren't going to care and if anything are going to flame you more, but it's perfectly ok.\n___\n**Player:** Stop fking feeding you trashlord.\n**You**: Go drink bleach/fk you you piece of shit/screw you _expletive here_/go die\n\nNot ok.\n___\nThe difference between defending yourself and retaliation is essentially the moment you cross the line into toxic territory, regardless of the integrity of the target. Being provoked _**might **_ net you a more lenient punishment, or give you a bit of leeway for fairly mundane responses like \"fk you\" so long as it isn't excessive and depending on the circumstance. That said, the moment you target that kind of negativity at a player it doesn't matter in the slightest who started it. \n\nIt is at that point where you are past being frustrated at someone talking shit about you, and you are proving that you yourself are also a negative player. \n\nAnd sometimes it isn't as clear cut for sure. Over the course of a game usually how that behaviour continues or doesn't is evidence enough for or against the player. When it doesn't, that's when reports, context and manual reviews come in.","replies":[{"poster":"Faisal Ahmed","date":"2016-06-25T02:45:58.199+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"You didn't actually read what I wrote.

Look, I see your point but take it this way. Person 1 and Person 2 are playing a game say basketball and Person 2 gets pissed because he is losing. Person 2 punches Person 1 and Person 1 retaliates so on and so forth. However, if Person 1 walked away and told a teacher (in this case, reporting the player) Person 2 would be in trouble but Person 1 would not be in trouble because he did not do anything. What i'm trying to say is, instead of retaliating, just mute the person and carry on with the game and then reporting him for toxicity after the game.","replies":[{"poster":"Faisal Ahmed","date":"2016-06-25T02:49:15.011+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Dude you're speaking like you've never played sport?
