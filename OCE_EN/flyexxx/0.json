One day you'll need them for real.

She's not as bad as before.\n\nAnyhow, if you really want to.\nOpen your client and go to the Shop, then go for Purchase History, scroll until you find Fiora and hit \"refund\".\nDoes not apply to any too old purchase.\nCan only be done three times per account. No extras.\nShould not be done unless you're absolutely sure.\nShould *never* be used to *refund champions* as they change over time.","replies":[]}]}
