With it includes a bunch of automated systems that so far have only been tested on NA (you know the largest LoL server with the highest population so the best grounds for testing new %%%%). These automated systems instantly ban people who talk like you, pretty funny don't you think?\nOh and hey look at that, just last patch we got a new Leaver Buster system that actually works!\n\nYup. Riot's totally doing nothing.\nAnd where the cock are you getting this two years crap from anyway? You probably only been playing LoL for as long as the OCE server has existed.","replies":[{"poster":"trolledallmylife","date":"2014-12-10T14:56:53.792+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"hmmm lets see so oce opens july 2013 and now Dec 2014 that's one yr to you yeh? 18 months!!!!!!!!!! http://forums.oce.leagueoflegends.com/board/showthread.php?t=2316\n\n1 yr? please suck riots cox more u coxsucker","replies":[{"poster":"Klavinmour","date":"2014-12-11T03:30:24.989+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yeah that's one year, sounds to me like you're one of those twats that say a baby is 21 months old.\nGet over yourself, you've already revealed yourself as nothing more than a lower class troll.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"EzeBlood","date":"2014-12-09T09:05:02.342+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"People like you are the reason OCE is cancerous, fool.
