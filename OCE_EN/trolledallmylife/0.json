Because you want to start up shit for the sake of starting up shit.\nWe've been guaranteed over and over again that the reports are being stored, and we've even had the ban waves that come from players being reported too much.\n\nAnd yes, so imaginary all the threads that pop up on NA from salty rule breakers who keep getting banned by the auto-systems they test over there.\n\n\nAlso where are the facts you're stating?

Stop the bullshit already.\nIt doesn't take two years to make a tribunal.\nYou can't fool 10 year olds anymore, they're 12 now. \nJokes aside.\n\nBut in all honesty, I have a feeling most ingame reports just count towards a tally; none of what is said is actually read unless reported directly from the report link on the L.O.L support link. I know for sure you don't give a rats ass whether or not a tribunal comes.\nThey'll just \"improve\" leavebuster, restrictions and reward players with skins **","replies":[]},{"poster":"trolledallmylife","date":"2015-05-01T17:44:26.136+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"\"chat restrictions, LeaverBuster and Intentional Feeder Detection.\"\n\nAll useless against TROLLS!\n\nIf someone runs around the map and does nothing and watches a team mate die and laugh at them, PLEASE TELL ME WHICH ONE OF THOSE USELESS SYSTEMS DETECTS THAT AND PUNISHES A TROLL??????????????\n\nUPGRADED TO WHAT!!!!!!!\n\nTHE TRIBUNAL WAS 100% FINE BEFORE YOU REMOVED IT!","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Slim Chaedi","date":"2015-04-24T14:18:15.412+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"OP: Rito doesn't care.\nRiot: Hey you guys said you want URF and its back.

You got it!\n\nWhile the Tribunal is taking ages and that does suck and I would love it if they hurried up, you are acting as if Riot does nothing at all and ignores the community completely. Its fine to be annoyed that the tribunal is taking ages, but why can't you just start a conversation where you aren't rude? A tribunal would be nice, because we'd possibly weed out the people who just want to argue, like you.
