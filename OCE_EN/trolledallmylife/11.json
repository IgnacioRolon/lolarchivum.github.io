The system will also sort out false reports. With the new reform system, it will evaluate their behaviour in game in a much faster way. \n\nIn your example about a player walking around the map, taunting and not attacking, they'll get reported and will face restrictions and potentially bans. As I mentioned to you in the FAQ thread it's really important that you report any negative behaviour you see, including in champion select.\n\nWith your example about afks, the updated LeaverBuster can detect when you aren't contributing to a game and you'll be evaluated for restrictions. \n\nI had a look at your account and I can see you have been restricted by LeaverBuster as recently as a few weeks ago. Similarly for other players that afk in games you are in, they'll be picked up and face restrictions and potentially bans if they keep doing it.","replies":[]}]}
