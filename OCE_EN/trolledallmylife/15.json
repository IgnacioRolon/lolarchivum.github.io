What ISP are you with?\n\nIt might be worth checking your recent game logs using something like [Logs of Lag](http://logsoflag.com/) and look for signs of packet loss. \n\nAlso - try running a trace route to the game servers (the IP to use is 103.240.227.1) to see if there are any issues with the connection between you and them.\n\nLet me know how you go.\n\nCheers\nMindstar","replies":[]}]}
