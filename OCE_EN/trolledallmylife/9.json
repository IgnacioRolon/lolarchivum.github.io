So instead they end up with a popularity drop that is bad for business.\n\nThere are many players who are permabanned by Riot you know, Riot is not hesitant in using the hammer in cases they see fit. Especially on NA board, there is never a shortage of \"I got falsely banned\" threads, so much so there is this conspiracy theory flying around that alleges Riot intentionally bans paying players because they know they will always come back with a fresh account to pay more in order to get back the things they've lost from permaban. But of course, the claim's legitimacy is really up for question given that if that were to be true, and considering LoL's popularity and aversion (competitive or just bitter ones), it should've been on the headlines by now; so I doubt it but whatever.\n\nThen again, community's narrative is rather indecisive, we're always trying to maintain both the claims that \"Riot bans no one because $$$\" and \"Riot bans everyone because $$$\", it just makes no sense. Which is it? Are either of them true in the first place?\n\nOh well.\n\nEDIT: oops, I didn't realise this is a small necro thread from 10 days ago.. soz. But I guess imma just leave it here.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Fitzky","date":"2017-05-07T03:29:52.938+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Welcome to League of Legends friend, the doors that way...","replies":[]},{"poster":"Łæoña","date":"2017-04-26T23:49:38.942+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Evidence","replies":[{"poster":"trolledallmylife","date":"2017-04-27T13:28:48.683+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Evidence?
