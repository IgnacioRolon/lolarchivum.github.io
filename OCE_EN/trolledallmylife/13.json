If you want to report someone like that with screenshots etc then the best thing to do is open a support ticket.\n\nThe Intentional Feeder System is different to the Instant Feedback System.\n\nYour reports make all the difference here so make sure you report someone you see doing this. They will get picked up and banned,  but it's not as fast as the Instant Feedback System.\n\nThe Player Behaviour team is working on improving the detection of gameplay toxicity such as feeders/trolls so this process can happen faster.","replies":[]},{"poster":"ForStSpyda","date":"2015-07-10T21:55:11.679+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"riot needs to implement a recording system for games and check the reports because geting reported for afk when u were not and getting hit with a leaver buster is wrong.  recording system would make it easy to determine who is breaking the rules and who is not. support doesnt seem to go anywhere ive put a number of tickets in and got some feed back but only to see the person i reported to be doing the same thing again.  its not like every player gets reported every game cant be to hard to speed thru a video recording see the feeder and ban him playstv.com records kills assists deaths time stamped.","replies":[{"poster":"JasonWazza","date":"2015-07-10T22:55:44.614+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yeah the main thing would be to gauge the time between deaths for a system like this over anything else drastic, because if the person is only alive for 20 seconds after each and every death, likelihood is his feeding as his walking a straight line and taking tower shots.\n\nRecording games is somewhat unnecessary, because the leaverbuster can tell if your AFK or not, it's not a stupid system.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Ashlee","date":"2015-07-09T16:11:16.092+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I had a really nasty feeder yesterday, he's still not banned. \n\nHe fed 18 times intentionally after i stuck up for our lee that he was verbally abusing (who was doing poorly, but had nothing to do with his own bad play). \n\nStill not banned :(","replies":[]},{"poster":"JasonWazza","date":"2015-07-09T16:55:14.368+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"10 hours and 9 games doesn't mean your gonna be instantly banned.","replies":[]}]}
