The adc later returned just to walk around the lane and do nothing but attempt to trigger all the players on the team. I was trying to stay positive and was telling my team multiple times to ignore the ADC and mute them are try to win the game. After realizing there was no chance of winning i had a go at the player within the span of probably 30 seconds to 1 minute of game time or even less. I do not feel it is fair to ban me for my first offence in 5 seasons of playing this game for 14 days without warning or anything along those lines. I was frustrated due to a player who i had given my role to was grieving and trying to get into the heads of our team, which it ended up working in my case.  I am currently trying to get my ban revoked or placed on some type of good behavior bond due to I dont want one brain snap in a game where a troll was grieving reflect who I am as a player over 5 seasons with no previous penalties or bad reputation.  If anyone could please help me I have submitted a ticket to riot bu they still have not replied, i dont feel it is fair to ban me for 14 days based on the actions of another player triggering me for 30 seconds when i was trying to maintain positivisty in the team and told my team to ignore the grieving player. Everyone has a bad day but i dont feel 30 seconds of being triggered should ruin my reputation as a player after 5 seasons of not having any form of behavior ban or chat restrictions. For anyone who plays the game, you can relate when youve been playing really well and someone decides to start grieving for no reason and trying to put down players on your team. The player also was going to all chat to tell the enemy tam to report me and was playing the innocent one. A lot of player at my elo do not really care about reporting the grieving players and prioritize winning the game or even claiming that the grieving player was not doing anything wrong because they want their LP and it is really not fair. I will take losing 5v5 but i dont see the justice in being banned for a 30second issue where the grieving player was not given any penalty and I was given 14 day ban as my first offence.","replies":[{"poster":"Adzyy","date":"2017-06-21T06:10:30.159+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"Sucks to see that you have been banned for something like this, seeing as you were frustrated at someone ruining your game on purpose and getting angry i can see where you are coming from. You would 100% be deserved of a 14 day ban if it was someone playing bad and you were angry and flamed them but this person was intentionally ruining the game and you slipped up and got a 14 day ban!? why not a chat restriction or a 2 day ban? weird that you got a 14 day ban on your first punishment of negative behaviour and it was over a troll in your game.\n\nSad to see, i hope Riot can see this and lifts the ban.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Teemõ","date":"2017-06-21T07:44:23.683+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"I have had this happen to me and a couple years back and i only got put on a chat restriction?

It can really wear you down and can really get on your nerves, before you know it you will be just as bad as the original perpetrator. Its really not a good thing and it affects everyone else around you.\n\ntl;dr: If something like this happens to you, (and i'm quoting a rioters article), Just ask the enemy team and your own to report that player and get out of that match as fast as possible, you don't want your optimism ruined by one game.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Actuality","date":"2017-06-25T07:18:37.007+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I know how you feel I just got perma-banned for the same stupid shit.
