I'm a first year &  I know quite a few people who I'm sure would love to join a league of legends club at macq, infact i have met/maintained a lot of my friends though league and i think that would be an awesome idea. I probably won't compete myself bc I am super shit at league but it would still be a cool thing to join","replies":[{"poster":"Conquisitor","date":"2016-03-08T01:18:35.545+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey Spoorenism,\nWe have endorsed MQ Gaming and Computing Society in Macquarie University.
