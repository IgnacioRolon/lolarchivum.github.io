But people in the games im playing with are so toxic and they dc cause there angry or just to piss off the friendly team, its a joke and i have lost all hope in the reporting thing league does cause it feels like nothings being done. I get that you cant ban everyone who gets a ban next to there name and i respect that but is there anyone who can give me something to work off like sure, im not the prefect player either i dont mean to put that across but im asking why isnt there being anything done?","replies":[{"poster":"Karmajinx","date":"2015-10-19T03:03:32.156+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You're Not alone...\nand the reporting system doesn't do anything.","replies":[]},{"poster":"HORSE OF FORCE","date":"2015-03-14T03:30:47.713+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Robots.
