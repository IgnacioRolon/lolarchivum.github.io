I'm Panda Annie from the OCE server! Here is my Sixth Montage for Annie! This Montage I try showing the advanced things about the champion not many people know! Enjoy! (Read more to know About Me!) & (AN UPDATE ON WHERE I HAVE BEEN FOR THE PAST 2 YEARS) My name is Cooper!","url":"https://youtu.be/dUQRo7oO1KA","image":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/dUQRo7oO1KA/hqdefault.jpg"},"up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"Hey People!\r\ni would appreciate any criticism or any input you think would of helped improve your experience watching the video to help make future videos!\r\n\r\nMy goal for this Montage was to try to show a side of a basic champ such as Annie that isn&#039;t seen often, while also trying to make it entertaining.\r\nI feel every champion in the game still has area to improve what possibilities they have, and yes that includes basic champions with very restricted kits.\r\n\r\nSo in this Montage i got clips of Animation Cancelling with W, Extended Tibbers Placements aswell as Trying to show how awesome it is to be able to control 2 champions at once with Tibbers and how effective it is if you know how to use it.\r\n\r\nit took 4 months to make this video (Getting the Clips, Editing, Animation) and i would love to see what people think of this video!\r\nI would also love to know if you still enjoyed the video if you&#039;re someone who doesn&#039;t play the champion or even hates the champion itself.\r\n\r\nThankyou\r\ntake care","replies":[{"poster":"Uthael","date":"2018-10-30T23:38:05.790+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Criticism from my personal viewpoint:\n- Dislike the screen filter (if that's what it's called). That overlay that changes color. EDIT: might have looked at the video differently if I had ever seen the song's video before.\n- 1:45 - 1:55 - had to rewatch a few times to figure out what was going on.\n- Liked the slowmo moments where camera went \"helicopter reporter view\"\n- Nice to see such good plays! Was amazed at 3:54 play. Meepo style.\n- I think it would be a good idea to link stuff between cadres with some indicators. For example, that Zo(mbi)e just looked like a transition. A regular arrow would look too plain. I don't know... A fire ring? Or some text like \"Wanna play with you!\" that follows her\n- Not playing Annie. Enjoyed the video. Not regretting those minutes of my life.","replies":[{"poster":"Panda Annie","date":"2018-10-31T04:18:32.438+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thank you for taking your time to help me ^_^\nif it's okay i would like to go into a bit of detail with your points!\n\n- **(DIslike Screen Filter)** : Do you think the filters were over the top? do you think it would have been better if it was turned down a bit? or do you think it will look better completely removed?\n- **(1:45 - 1:55 Confusion)** : Noted ✓ - _Will keep that in mind for future videos_\n- **(Helicopter View Moments)** : i feel if i added more of those moments it would become repetitive to see it over and over. Maybe i was wrong? do you think more would have made it more entertaining?\n- **(Fire Ring)** : That's a great point! wish that came to my mind while making the actual video xD i really like that Fire Ring idea, i could greenscreen Annie's E and use that as the Fire Ring. Thankyou for that point!\n- **(Your Overall Experience)** : Ayy, i'm really glad you enjoyed the video! it makes me happy to even see you were 'Amazed' at one point~","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"LRIG Tama","date":"2018-11-01T08:36:18.573+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Omigosh! That's amazing <3\n\nI remember how I used to watch your streams and older videos before you stopped posting, and even when you edited for Sunnysplosion.\n\nAmazing job! Keep it up!!!! With the exception of only a handful, you definitely seem like one of those rare League YouTubers that puts loads of effort into their content :)\n\nI normally do editing in a very cute style, so I can't really say anything about yours... other than it's obvious how much time and effort you put into it <3","replies":[{"poster":"Panda Annie","date":"2018-11-01T15:04:34.485+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Cowabunga dude!! <3\ni'm surprised you even knew about me back then xD\n\nayy~ i appreciate your comment!\ni do plan on making more videos once i know exactly what i want my video style to be like. but that seems to have taken awhile to fully grasp :P\n\nBut until then! i'll take that comment as motivation and continue to make stuff for my personal channel rather then editor work all the time.\nhope to see you then ^_^","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Whatshisnamee","date":"2018-11-07T05:09:12.341+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"ur first mistake\n - anime\nsecond mistake\n- screen filter things\n\nthis is why i stopped watching after 30 sec{{champion:119}}","replies":[{"poster":"Panda Annie","date":"2018-11-11T16:03:36.897+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"thanks for the comment~ i'm sorry you disliked it so early.\ni was trying something a little different to the norm in terms on expectations of what a league montage is.\n\nthanks for giving it a shot tho","replies":[{"poster":"Whatshisnamee","date":"2018-11-14T05:00:38.383+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"its ok you will do better next time {{champion:119}}","replies":[]}]}]}]}
