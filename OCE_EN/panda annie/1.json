Now Tibbers Appear Frame (When he actually appears aswell as the Damage and the Stun itself) is actually not the same frame as Stun Frame, there a-couple of milliseconds apart... (Yes Tibbers Appearing isnt exactly instant. Stun Frame was tho)\r\n\r\nand thats why sometimes if you estimated flash Tibbers placement it would still hit since Stun Frame has confirmed...\r\n\r\n\r\nNow back to the Bug in patch 6.9...\r\n\r\nWhat has happened is Tibbers Stun frame is not confirming correctly... it may be because they tried to fix W in the coding (since they announced that as one of her Bug Fixes) by increasing the Millisecond on Stun Frame for W in the code, but didn&#039;t even it out for tibbers....\r\n\r\nit seems now Tibbers Stun Frame is after his Appear Frame... and its getting quite frustrating to play with.\r\n\r\nIf people have any reference footage for &quot;Old Tibbers Flashing yet it still counting as Stun&quot; aswell as a reference of the Bug itself i would edit the links in.\r\ni hope this gets noticed a bit~ it doesn&#039;t seem to hard of a fix. just needs to be timed abit better.","replies":[{"poster":"Ingénue","date":"2016-05-11T10:45:54.900+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Head [over on this board](http://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/bug-report), and check if it has been described.
