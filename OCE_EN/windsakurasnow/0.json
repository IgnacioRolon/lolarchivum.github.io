Just mins ago, i was playing ranked game, and there was a Azir using Lethal Tempo and had no skills at ALL!!!! He just put the sand sodiers donw and do nothing and 1vs5, i was play kindred and carried that team but still lost, we couldnt even touch him, that was so broken, he killed our tank in half second. I cannot except that. There is no balance at all.","replies":[{"poster":"Akkordian Zoeve","date":"2017-11-10T03:52:14.045+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":1,"body":"On the one hand, it ruins the experience for players.

Which for _' one of the hardest champs in the game'_ is a pretty stupid playstyle.","replies":[{"poster":"tts01008","date":"2017-11-10T17:20:56.044+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I had a look at his match history: I believe the \"tank\" he mentioned was actually a Rakan that did not build any mr other than mercury's.  From the team gold analysis it seemed like they lost because of one bad teamfight, indicating that the accusation of Azir \"do nothing and 1vs5\" was not likely to be a real thing - if Azir is that much overpowered, the opponent team would not need to wait for them to throw the game.  Overall, their team had almost no hard CC (other than a one-shot Rakan and Jinx snare) or tank, which made their carries impossible to reach Azir, and their only dive in,  Zed,  did not seem to know what he was doing.  Their bad team comp was the main reason that they cannot stop Azir.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Azirious Mistake","date":"2017-11-11T10:11:41.925+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"In all fairness, any equally fed ADC can 3 shot Azir as well if he builds in a way that can 3 shot an ADC.","replies":[{"poster":"Lord Sesshomaru","date":"2017-11-11T12:44:48.560+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"This is true, but he has twice the range and infinitely more utility.\n\nAzir is a strong champ when played well, the flexibility in his kit will always ensure this.\nThe new rework doesn't make him any stronger, it just makes it much easier to play him well.\n\nI fully agree that champs like Vayne or Draven are far more of a threat to the game than Azir, however I think he still warrants a nerf to his late-game damage. He is intended as a sustained champ _(one of the few AP tank-killers)_ and if you have the ability to kill tanks, you shouldn't also be able to take out squishies as easily as he does. Much the same way that Assassins _shouldn't_ be able to take out tanks.\n\nTbh, I think the real problem is that there is just too much damage in the game atm, in nearly all champs. \nAssassins have enough damage to burst an ADC twice over. Meanwhile fighters and Mages get assassin level damage. It has gotten to the point where everyone just 1-hits everyone else, and I don't think thats the healthiest gameplay. So if a nerf to my favourite champ is the first step to combating that, then so be it!","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"QuitoLie","date":"2017-11-11T09:17:08.581+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"No man...
