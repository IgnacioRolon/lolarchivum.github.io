Sometimes I have the tendency to lag like crazy, causing me to disconnect. If I do AFK, is this perma-bannable? Or does a perma-ban only count towards behavioral problems? Am kinda worried since I might have to leave occasionally (the game just doesn&#039;t load sometimes). Also, if I can&#039;t connect at the start of a game and it results in a remake, will I be perma-banned? Thanks for the help.","replies":[{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2018-01-19T10:32:23.851+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"The short answer is no. The longer answer is if you're doing it all the time in ranked you can get a full punishment for it, but generally speaking you will only rack up longer Leaver Busters (kinda like a queue dodge timer) starting at 5 minutes for 5 games and going up to 20 mins for 5 games.","replies":[{"poster":"monkeymango","date":"2018-01-19T11:18:03.219+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thanks man {{sticker:slayer-pantheon-thumbs}}","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Jockulation","date":"2018-01-19T14:21:14.570+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Don't play League.\n\nSounds hard, but your unstable connection is causing 4 other people to potentially lose because of it.","replies":[]}]}
