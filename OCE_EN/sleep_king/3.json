But the store is out with halloween skins and I can't seem to purchase the bundle exclusive red skin or find a way to obtain the gold skin.\r\n\r\nDoes anyone know if there is anyway to get these two skins?\r\n\r\nCheers.","replies":[{"poster":"Lord Sesshomaru","date":"2019-10-26T05:04:23.137+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"This is the thing I hate about Riot's current way of releasing limited stuff...\nPeople can't complete their collections for their mains.. it's sad..\n\n{{sticker:sg-soraka}} \n\n_____________\n\nTo add to what Seras said; the new skins are already out, and there are no gold halloween chromas available for tokens.  I would hazard a guess that this means they won't return this year.  However that doesn't mean they wont in the future.  Ashe's gold chroma did NOT come back last year with the new championship chromas, however this year it has made a return.  So there is decent hope for Ekko.\n\nThere is already a TON of stuff in the token store (and more to come), far more than you could ever get from earning tokens, and unless you've got a massive disposable income, there's too much to get even if you are buying tons of tokens.  My guess is that Riot doesn't want to over-crowd the token store _(but they've already failed IMO)_ because then people would see it as too hopeless to obtain all the collectables they want.  Theres a fine line between putting in a little too much, to get people to spend a little extra cash.  and just overloading it and making people give up.\n\n______________\n\nAs for the red chroma, not to contradict Seras here as I may well be wrong, but I was under the impression that the red chroma is always available as a bundle exclusive regardless of when the skins first release.  And the issue here is not that the chroma itself is missing, but that the option to buy the bundle is missing.\n\nAs for if/when the bundle may return, only Riot knows that, and they're real stingy with re-release info, so I cant help you there sorry.\n\nGood luck!","replies":[{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2019-10-26T06:22:55.515+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Ah yes, I assumed the ward skin would be available for tokens which is what made me think we'd have them back, but it's just a bundle one.\n\nThey had High Noon this year but still released Tales from the Rift skins, so not sure when or if last years chromas will come back. Like you say, could be a bi-yearly thing.\n\nYou're totally right about the Ruby Chromas, they do persist in the bundles. Clearly, I was rushing far too much when I wrote my initial comment. I don't know if the chroma bundles come back at the same time as their associated legacy skins show up in the shop, but that would be the time to look for that one.","replies":[]}]}]}
