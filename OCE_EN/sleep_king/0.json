But I noticed you implied that it should also block players from ever being matched with you in-game.\n\nIn theory this sounds like a great idea. Having to play with the same flamer twice is a terrible experience. But in practice it simply hasn't been shown to work in a competitive matchmaking system.\n\nJust recently Overwatch [had to remove this exact system](https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/2016/06/22/overwatch-avoid-this-player/) because too many players were abusing it. They'd just block really good players to avoid getting matched with them again.

If you see or hear about another person breaking the rules, send us a ticket directly so we can investigate and take action if necessary. We know that players report publicly with the best intentions, but it often leads to a witchhunt, rarely resulting in a positive discussion. We'll be taking action against players who have violated rules, so please report these players correctly.\n\nModerators will be looking for the following:\n\nPosts that accuse others of being toxic players in-game\nPosts accusing others of malicious activity\nPosts that accuse others of cheating or using illegal services\nPosts accusing others of trolling in the boards (there’s a report button for that)\"\n\n---\n\nAs for the game itself I am sorry that you ran into toxic players that intentionally fed on your team, however there are a few things you can do in the future to reduce the risk of this happening.\n\nThe first of which is remember that you are playing ranked which is a high pressure environment where poeple want to win. As such most players want their team to play strong picks to increase their chance of winning. So when a person on thier team wants to play something off meta it can give some players a knee jerk reaction to try and stop you because they think it'll be harder to win.\n\nWith that in mind a way that you can go about this in another way is before you pick or hover what you want to, if it is not meta ask your team if they are alright with you doing so. In this example explain you've had a good run with it and think it'll work well vs the enemy team. This may help your team understand why you want to pick it and give a better chance of no one having a knee jerk reaction.\n\nAfter that if you still have someone threatening to troll if you do so, you have the choice of either risking them trolling, or picking something else to make sure the game is a positive environment. The later of the two I would suggest as if your team is positive, it leads to a team that will work together to win. So in that case you could pick a support that is more meta in a sense that you have practiced as well.\n\n---\n\nI hope that this helps and if there is anyway I can help or any questions I can answer let me know. Good luck in your games!\n\n~Elam","replies":[{"poster":"Sleep King","date":"2017-01-06T01:30:55.482+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Cheers for the reply mate.\n\nUnfortunately I did do everything you suggested.\nExplained my pick, the situation.
