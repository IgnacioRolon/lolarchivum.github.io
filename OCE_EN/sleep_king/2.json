I used to be the owner of my Club but now apparently I am not. Just looking for advice on where I should post a thread about getting re-instated into my own club / how to lodge a ticket to support.\r\n\r\n2. Any idea if or when the Mighty Jax and/or Vandal Jax are going to be sold again?\r\n\r\nCheers.","replies":[{"poster":"Sleep King","date":"2018-01-04T03:38:17.235+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"bump","replies":[{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2018-01-04T05:27:27.745+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Please don't bump posts this early, there's really no need to and it can get spam-y very quickly.\n\nAs for your Jax skins, you have what Psylock suggested, since those shops are tailored, and often do happen more than once a year, I expect there will be one for Lunar Revel, so if you play a lot of Jax then you are likely to get those skins in your shops. Past that, you only have the luck of boxes, or to wait until Riot decides to open the vault again.\n\nAs for club issues, since they're account specific you will have to submit a support ticket.\nhttps://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/requests/new","replies":[{"poster":"Sleep King","date":"2018-01-04T12:02:33.663+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thanks champion","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Psylock1234","date":"2018-01-04T04:42:37.630+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"ik what to do for vandal jax and mighty jax wait for your shop that's how I got all my twitch skins which makes me want to kill myself more than I already do cos every1 of my friends has medieval twitch and I don't T-T","replies":[{"poster":"Sleep King","date":"2018-01-04T05:05:52.315+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You mean the end of year shop thing?\n\nThat's a long term strat I dont think I want any part in ><","replies":[{"poster":"Psylock1234","date":"2018-01-04T22:41:15.713+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"no it happened twice this year","replies":[]}]}]}]}
