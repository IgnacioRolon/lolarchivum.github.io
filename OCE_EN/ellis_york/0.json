A ton of people have all the champions in the game and really nothing else to do with blue essence, so champ shards to them are worthless. They have 100k+ BE and nothing to really do with it until the BE shop rolls around again. But I have a solution! What if you could reroll a champion shard for a skin shard for that champion. Let&#039;s say you have a Jax shard, and you like playing Jax, and you didn&#039;t have much cash right now to just buy a skin, or you wanted a legacy skin. Reroll the Jax shard for a skin shard for Jax, and if you don&#039;t own it yet, just activate it with orange essence!","replies":[{"poster":"JesusForgotHisGA","date":"2018-09-05T01:15:11.245+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Won't happen as that would be taking dollars out of their pockets.","replies":[{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2018-09-05T05:23:56.649+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Shockingly enough profits are necessary to continue growth.","replies":[{"poster":"JesusForgotHisGA","date":"2018-09-08T01:38:20.780+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Seras Dragon,realm=OCE,application-id=hIjvqaz6,discussion-id=JJAX8yrk,comment-id=00000000,timestamp=2018-09-05T05:23:56.649+0000)\n>\n> Shockingly enough profits are necessary to continue growth.\n\nHow's about some growth in the automated banning system that simply does not work?\n\nHow's about some growth in the customer service department where they actually personalise responses rather than picking the best automated reply, even if it doesn't answer or resolve the issue on hand?\n\nHow's about actually giving something back to people instead of charging them for every single fucking item in the game? How many people are sitting on a tone of blue essence that is esentially useless? 350RP for a simple emote is a rip on it's own, small insignificant items like this should be given away for free via blue essence as small token of appreciation for continually playing this cesspit.\n\nNah wtf for right? Lets just continue to pump out skins whilst the game turns to utter shit.","replies":[]},{"poster":"00shots00","date":"2018-09-06T00:54:52.568+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"can't make profits if you have no clients","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"ClickClack472","date":"2018-09-06T10:33:04.163+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Maybe something like 3 or 5 champ shards rather than 1","replies":[]}]}
