However, these people don&#039;t give the Arena of the Shadow Isles a chance! The Twisted Treeline offers fast-paced, action-packed games of LoL that are easy, quick and fun. The smaller map allows for more skirmishes and duels to occur. Since there are only two lanes and a three camp jungle, it will be very fun to see what becomes OP and what lane assignments will develop. YOU COULD TAKE PART IN THIS PROCESS!!!\r\n\r\nAdditionally, there are only three players on this map, allowing for more carry potential and game impact. This also means teamfights are less overwhelming for those of us who find it that way on the Rift or the Abyss. Team comps are completely different from the Rift, as a team only has 3 champions to create a harmonious comp with different, harmonic roles!\r\n\r\nThe Treeline has its own unique set of objectives. Firstly, there are two alters on either side of the jungle (one closer to the blue team&#039;s nexus, and the other closer to the red team&#039;s nexus). Capturing and holding an alter (by standing on them and letting the enemy gain vision of you for 8 seconds) will give you a movespeed buff and 80 gold for each player on your team. Captuing and holding both alters will also make you gain health from killing units. There is also a health relic in the middle of the map similar to the one on the Howling Abyss. Last but not least, there is the Vilemaw, a giant spider that, once slain, gives your teams a buff that enhances your minions. Learning how these objectives work is a fun process, like how you all once did on the Rift&#039;s objectives.\r\n\r\nMany summoners may not play Treeline because they are not used to it and therefore have had negative experiences on it. However, I remind you: did you not have unfortunate times when you first played on the Rift? Although mechanics will carry over to the Treeline, game knowledge is completely different, and so must be learned. This experience is just as fun on the Treeline as the rift, I assure you.\r\n\r\nIf you want more information on the map, I would highly recommend this website: http://www.theshadowisles.com/. It has all you would want to know about OP Champs, Champion Select and gameplay in other regions that have had this opportunity longer than us Oceanians!\r\n\r\nCurrently, Treeline Flex is enabled every Thursday afternoon from 3:00pm - 1:00am. However, this is still &quot;being tested and subject to change&quot;, so play on the Treeline!!! Our competitive gamemode on the Shadow Isles may be removed if you don&#039;t play on it!!! Jump on and show Riot that OCE deserves all the good gamemodes as well as the bigger servers!!!!!!\r\n\r\nHave a nice day, and see you on the Treeline!","replies":[{"poster":"CrimzonFuRi","date":"2016-12-21T10:08:47.655+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Really indepth discussion about the Twisted Treeline and how its being left under the bus!
