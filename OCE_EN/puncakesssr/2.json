I don't know, that shouldn't really be happening unless you've just recently had a massive spike in climbing elo. But the matchmaking is more balanced at more active times generally... That's too bad but if it's intentional it's because they think you deserve high gold so that's kinda nice compliment but also horrible since the season is almost over and you need gold for the loot don't you?\n\nAnyways goodluck, maybe someone at rito might notice something wrong, and in the meantime I believe in you puncake, I believe you can win and climb. I'm sure you can do it even though I've never met you before. You can do it. Believe in yourself.","replies":[{"poster":"Bambooze","date":"2016-09-11T00:29:26.216+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Give this man a medal","replies":[{"poster":"PuncakesssR","date":"2016-09-13T23:36:37.767+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Amen, I got to gold just last night, thanks for having faith in me man.
