I&rsquo;m only a Platinum player myself, so for that reason I will only be offering coaching to Bronze, Silver, and low Gold level players. \nI was also a mid-high Masters level player in Starcraft II, so I have a solid understanding of what&rsquo;s required to improve at a game &ndash; particularly in terms of mindset.\n\nWhat sessions will consist of:\n-Quick discussion about your goals/expectations in League and your mentality/approach to the game\n-Going over your replay together (we will use Skype screen-share so you can follow in real time)\n-Q&A of anything you&rsquo;d like answered\n\nIf you&rsquo;d like to focus on anything in particular during the session, I&rsquo;m happy to accommodate &ndash; just let me know.\n\nIf you would like coaching, or have any questions, please add me on Skype (xenox99)\n\nP.S. It's preferable if students main Mid lane. Some information will carry over to other lanes, but you will get the most benefit if you play to focus on Mid.","replies":[{"poster":"Candy Kayn","date":"2015-10-25T09:07:37.724+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Gold V mid main really interested in improving","replies":[{"poster":"TeCoolMage","date":"2015-10-26T08:03:21.367+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I think that injury, unless crippling, fatal, or complicated (I once got a bone that broke, then the broken bone dislocated... ouch, ended up taking 6 months), should be healed by now.\n\nIf it is complicated or crippling, but not fatal, can you change BSG to UBSG because I'm unranked","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"ƒamous","date":"2015-11-04T07:52:01.328+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Pls add me, ƒamous.\n\nIf not pls reply with your in-game name :~)","replies":[]},{"poster":"Euphener","date":"2015-11-04T06:43:42.851+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Add My name on LoL:o0Penatrix0o\n\nI Main Zed and have Yas as a secondary Main if that works better (:","replies":[]},{"poster":"Valkrai","date":"2015-05-15T10:18:20.402+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"i play mid and im decent but looking to get better. valkrai.","replies":[]},{"poster":"IMAFIRINMAHLAZER","date":"2015-05-15T04:04:24.481+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Add me in game dude: iamthefox\nCurrently in gold 2","replies":[]}]}
