It has always crashed randomly but now I can&#039;t just shut the client down and restart it. \r\n\r\nAlso I was blocked from a game by a massive download starting when I tried to reconnect. \r\n\r\nI can&#039;t even go in ranked because this is so frequent that I basically have minutes of afk in every game while I try to reconnect. \r\n\r\nIs there anything I can do to make this more stable. My graphics drivers are up to date. I&#039;ve tried reinstalling lol. I have a decent connection which only rarely spikes during storms, or bad weather. \r\n\r\nSadly I have actually spent money on this game and I can&#039;t even play it without the client crashing or freezing completely now. Would be great if I could actually get it working to a point I can play ranked without auto losing a third of my games.","replies":[{"poster":"SephirothSG","date":"2017-09-21T10:13:04.206+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey there,\n\nThis sounds odd, are you on a laptop or a desktop PC? Do you experience this issue in any other graphically demanding games?","replies":[]}]}
