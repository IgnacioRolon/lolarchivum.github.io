The Items included in the build are an AMD FX-8320, MSI RADEON R9 290, NZXT PHANTOM 240. These are the parts that I chosen to use for gaming and just wanted to know what you guys think and if I should change anything?  *ThIs computer isn't just for league its for other games like Dayz, BF4 and the occasional video/photo editing **","replies":[{"poster":"Darth VÃ¡per","date":"2014-12-01T01:33:32.755+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Do NOT get an AMD.","replies":[{"poster":"Luciid","date":"2014-12-01T03:23:47.864+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The reason why I chose the AMD it is a more affordable bang for buck processor compared to the intel series that tend to be around $50-$100 more expensive.","replies":[{"poster":"Darth VÃ¡per","date":"2014-12-01T17:17:20.897+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yea that is a positive with the AMD's they are cheaper but that's like the only positive thing about them, i'd never get an AMD, i would've saved up some more money and got an Intel, an I5 is pretty much all you need which is what i have.","replies":[{"poster":"Luciid","date":"2014-12-02T04:19:26.384+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"What combination of parts would you recommend keeping in mind that I am on a $1k Budget.

Their processors are definitely much more efficient.\nI have an AMD 8320 overclocked, and as much as I like it, compared to another machine with a nice intel i7 K series, the intel just about outperforms it on every front.\n\nAMD also loves to suck power, so factor that into your build as well.\nAlso, why not go for something like the nVidia GTX 970, it's only a little bit more than the 290, but it smashes it. The 970 is probably the best bang for buck card currently on the market.\n\nBut it's your choice dude.","replies":[{"poster":"Luciid","date":"2014-12-01T03:21:51.466+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The reason why I chose the 290 over the 970 was because of the $85 Dollar difference and for the performance increase it is very little.  I have looked on various benchmarking sites and the frames difference in about 10 FPS more, This is why I don't think that it is worth spending the extra $80.","replies":[{"poster":"FauxSho","date":"2014-12-01T03:28:25.855+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Fair call - from memory the AMD's use more power though, so that is also a thought. It may end up equating similar down the line if you are one that pays the power bills.. \n\nEssentially though, this is pure preference.\nThe nVidia cards have much better drivers in my experience. AMD drivers are dodgy at times I've found and can cause more issues than I really like. Other than though, they are solid cards when working.","replies":[{"poster":"Luciid","date":"2014-12-01T03:51:34.566+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I See where you are coming from but at the moment the prices for the AMD cards are quite a bit cheaper and the performance is still pretty good.

Nah, I play a various amount of games, I don't really play League as much as I used to, at the time I needed the PC for music, however upgraded it for future games, best parts at the time, I think it will last another 2 years if I must drop down to high it's still good.
