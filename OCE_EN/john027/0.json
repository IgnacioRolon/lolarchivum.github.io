And have memories of playing it when it was Beta.\r\nThings came up and i dropped LoL for years (i played a couple games in 2013) and that was the latest i could remember.\r\nI met new friends and i realized they played on a new oceanic server (from Australia), but i was left out because i couldn&#039;t transfer.\r\nI had tons of friends and achievements from my years on this account and i really wish i could transfer, and i can&#039;t afford the expensive payout to transfer and apparently i missed a free transfer when i was inactive.\r\n\r\nThank you for reading, and i hope you take my situation in consideration\r\nJohn027","replies":[{"poster":"HORSE OF FORCE","date":"2015-05-14T01:56:32.655+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'm very sorry to hear that. Free transfers are for usually when the server is still new, so that players who would have selected that server when they signed up aren't penalised for signing up before the server existed. Then there were some extremely rare special events where transfers were free again (usually for OCE-specific events). It's not likely going to happen again for any time in the foreseeable future.\n\nIt's a complicated and strenuous business to transfer the entirety of an account from one server to the next, and a bit disorientating to your friends on your current server too (not to mention the possible MMR differences between regions). The charge is to help with the business and to discourage people from rapidly switching between servers.\n\nYour best option is to simply save up enough money for the RP in order to transfer. There might be a sale or something worth waiting for in the meantime.\n\nIf you want to try and appeal to a red for this, [make a support ticket](https://support.leagueoflegends.com/anonymous_requests/new).\n\nBest of luck.","replies":[]}]}
