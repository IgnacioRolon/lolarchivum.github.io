However, if you'd like to transfer to EUNE, unfortunately the only way to do so is to purchase an account transfer from the PVP.net Store. There aren't any free transfers going on, and it doesn't look like free transfers between the two servers will be offered in the foreseeable future. Sorry about that.","replies":[]}]}
