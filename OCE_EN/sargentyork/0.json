It's hard for Riot to catch bots 1-30 because at lower levels it can be difficult to differentiate between genuine noobs and bots. All you can do is report the bots, including the word \"bot\" in your report, and ensure that even if these accounts are eventually sold, they will be banned in due time.\n\nIf everyone reported every bot they saw, no bot accounts would be sold because they'd all be banned, and it would not longer be a profitable business.","replies":[]},{"poster":"JesusForgotHisGA","date":"2017-01-29T21:25:35.977+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"So is ARAM. Played 2 games of ARAM this morning, 1st game of the day 2 bots. 2nd game in a row 2 more bots. It's pathetic. There isn't even a real option to report them. Like does it go under cheating? Not only that why are these accounts who I would assume get reported every game aren't banned? It just goes to show how bullshit and retarded broken Riots reporting system is. The only effective reporting that works is the verb abuse one and that's because it's so easy for the automated system to pickup on certain keywords in game and act accordingly.","replies":[{"poster":"ROGU3","date":"2017-01-30T18:36:58.569+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Make sure to describe it as \"botting\" in the description panel of your report.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Wean","date":"2017-01-29T21:36:06.517+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It would not be quite likely for such a thing to happen in pvp, however this doesn't mean it won't happen at all in pvp.

I'm sure there are people like myself who don't have many friends who play League. Busy work schedules, nightshift work... the different types of circumstances are endless. People shouldn't have to resort to partying up with other JUST to get a decent game. It's a baindaid fix at best and doesnt resolve anything. Riot just need to pull their finger out of there asses and do something. Stop making new champs, stop making new skins and focus on what's actually ruining the game for the majority. Too much focus has gone into other area's and on the pro scene and everyone else is being left behind with a game that's riddled with toxic players and bots.","replies":[]}]}
