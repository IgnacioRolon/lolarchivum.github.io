LPL, NA, EU and so on. I don't know if the teams or the analysts themselves have done stats and numbers to confirm if this is the best way to play the game but I do know the rest of the world follows their lead. This does not in my opinion, mean as an independent team that you should follow the meta but unless you have a solid working strategy with a team of you're own then statistically you will be hard pressed to find success any other way.","replies":[{"poster":"Nightjar","date":"2016-07-26T12:50:36.578+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"generally if you want to see purely what \"works\" you look at what they do in korea. If they change bot and mid in korea; then I'd advise you do the same. Otherwise it's probably not efficient.\n\n Also midlane is designed to be the shortest lane; hence champions that need to snowball and roam alot are best placed here since they can roam the map easier from the center and get back in lane faster after recalling. The adc however needs to farm up more than get kills and roam since they are all about items and lategame. The open sides encourage either mobility or range and cc since ganks from the jungle can be devastating. Due to this battle mages and assassins tend to fare better in midlane. Bot lane is the most appropriate lane for dragon control since they are furthest from the bruisers of toplane and can afford the time out of lane due to it's length with less risk of their opposing laner turning up uninvited after they force a back. Thus the combo that can take the dragon fastest and safest with least damage, the adc, jg and sup is best suited for dragon control.","replies":[{"poster":"bgentle2myashe","date":"2016-07-26T12:55:25.502+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Nightjar,realm=OCE,application-id=FjGAIbRv,discussion-id=EuF7roA9,comment-id=00000000,timestamp=2016-07-26T12:50:36.578+0000)\n>\n> generally if you want to see purely what &quot;works&quot; you look at what they do in korea.
