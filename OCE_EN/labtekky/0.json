I&#039;m not interested in wasting more time trying to go through FAQ&#039;s that don&#039;t resolve .... all.\r\nGame crashed while my team was annihilating in a ranked game. Nothing to do with anything on my end... I know this, beacause;\r\n1. The in game clock was still running and the voice was still saying the enemy inhibitors were respawning soon.. (Not my computer).\r\n2. I Alt tabbed and loaded various sites &amp; games without lag or connection issues at all. (Not my connection or firewall).\r\n3. All the other characters on the screen (Friendly $ Enemy) had frozen in place. Also, after a while.. The champions started twitch glitching on the spot. (League of legends issue).\r\n\r\nAfter attempting to reconnect several times, it just leads me back at the same window.. Prompting me a reconnect because I? I left a game.. Cough.\r\nAfter attempting to log in again it still leads me back at that window.. It&#039;s been a few hours now.\r\n\r\nI was in a series trial too.. Typicaly, I would guess this&#039;ll count as a loss - I will not be awarded my win and I will just have ta &#039;suck it up, princess&#039;.\r\n\r\nTHANKS!","replies":[{"poster":"Lilja","date":"2015-06-24T23:25:04.965+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"If you are wanting help to try and prevent future problems you should detail what happened when you tried to reconnect.","replies":[]}]}
