So we hope you enjoy the character as much as we have fun making him.\n\n{{champion:8}}btw its pronounced oot\n\n{{champion:90}}  \nI&#039;ll start it off. I was in charge of the character&#039;s concept, from his appearance to his lore. Everything was thought out with a few small key points in mind. The first key point was that we wanted to make a rebelling Noxian champion that was against the the certain ideas of Noxus and has a hatred for Swain, who Yut sees as the root of Noxus&#039;s problems. The second idea we wanted to keep the idea of him having amnesia, to give the idea that he is in fact not Noxian, but from elsewhere. Most signs pointing towards Ionia.\n\nThe inspiration for his design was the species Khajit from Skyrim, we moved though different designs through out the months and at some point had an idea to give him some kind of demonic arm that was to be possibly linked to The Darken. That was later scrapped since we wanted to keep his rope blades. His name, I got from my background. It&#039;s a Thai name, that underneath means War. Since this is a character attempting to start a war within Noxus&#039;s walls, we thought the name would be fitting.\n\n{{champion:8}} \nso this is the kit i created for him, i had intended for a swiss army knife leader since most of the abilities involve pretty much running in no fear style, but he has many downsides such as being innately squishy with low armor stats and high movespeed, so yeah pretty much a fighter assassin that can play in other roles than just the top lane  ( even though techincally a support needs to&quot;support&quot; with heals and such)\n\n**resource**: cooldowns\n\n**Passive** : dire wolf  ; after every 3 spells Yut gains a shield. this shield can stack 3 times refreshing the time the shield stays.\nThe lower Yuts hp becomes, the higher his movespeed and attack damage become.\n\n**Q** : blade art: shifting chains: yut manipulates the chains of\n his vale blades to dash through his enemies, dragging anything he went through to his location.\n\n_empowered_: Yut wraps his chains around the enemy and then throws them at a targeted location stunning them.\n\n**W** :blade art: dance of knives: Yut becomes untargetable for 1.5 seconds whirling his chains around himself for 1 second slowing and damaging any enemies within the chains radius.\n\n_empowered_: Yut surrounds everything around him in his chains pushing them to him.\n\n**E** :blade art: Counter strike for 2.5 seconds Yut can roughly reflect any spell, 40%  the intended damage \nwill be used as the new damage along with 60% of Yuts bonus attack damage.\n\n**R**: blade art: manipulation Yut breaks out his bladecombos, doing three attacks dashing on each attack. on the third attack Yut uses his chains to knock the enemy up.\n\nafter every third blade art: manipulation, Yut can empower his next normal ability.\n\n**dance**: ponponpon\n**movement**:walking- he uses a sort of hopping motion from side to side\n**running**: he crouches, doing a low dash with his hands low to the ground\n\n\n{{champion:90}} \nOkay, onto the lore. I written two types of lore, one told in story format and one in a letter. These don&#039;t give a full idea of character&#039;s backstory, but give enough information to know what could have happened. \n\nhttp://cheshyerr.deviantart.com/art/Yut-Design-2-585535625?q=in%3Ascraps%20sort%3Atime%20gallery%3ACheshyerr&amp;qo=0\n**Story**- _Note that this is from before the complete design was finished. if youd like to see how he looked for this particular story click the link above.   _\n> \n>  \n>  Under a dark cloud, the city of Noxus was at it&#039;s darkest. It was long past midnight and the moon was nowhere in sight. There were no lights besides those that the street lights provided. \n>  A cold wind blew though the dark streets, no one would be out at this time. No one but the homeless and the hungry. \n>  &quot;NOOOO!&quot; \n>  &quot;Hold still you brat!&quot; \n>  Anything similar of those yells, those sounds, everyone would turn a blind eye and continue their day. That was the way of Noxus, the strong survive and the weak die. Failure to follow this resulted in death. \n>  The crying child struggled against the large man, sobbing his heart out. He hoped, he wished, that someone would save him, but he knew that none would. The man licked his lips, holding down the small boy. Getting out a knife from his belt. &quot;Stay still. Or I&#039;ll make sure to cut up that pretty little neck of yours!&quot; \n>  &quot;No! Stop!&quot; The child screamed, still believing someone would come. A hard slap silenced him. \n>  &quot;Be quiet! No one is coming for a weak little street rat like you. So stop scream-!&quot;\n>  \n>  The man was cut off by a strong pull from his back, being tossed off the child and into the other side of the alley. \n>  &quot;Who said no one would come for him?&quot;\n>  Standing over the child protectively was a figure, he was shorter then the man but much taller then the boy. The new person appeared to be in his late teens at least. His appearance was different from any other person in Noxus. His legs were that of a wolf, a long thin tail like a lion peaked out from his backside. Tall ear stood proud on his head past a red bandana. His fur and hair was a dark grey, the right side of his face being white. He was slightly tanned with what looked like some kind of burn on the right side of his face, a right yellow eye to mix with it. His clothes were a black set of loose pants and turtle neck top that was short and showed his belly. A blue vest with a furred collar sat tightly around his back and the sleeveless top. One arm was bandaged complexly, as well as his clothed chest and the right arm was an armoured red and silver in contrast, holding an appearance of a demon.\n>  Blue and yellow eyes narrowed at the man as he flicked out his knife. &quot;Really?&quot; He commented before looking at the shivering and shocked boy behind him. He smiled and knelt down, facing the child as his eyes glowed blue. He brought up his finger smiling calmly. &quot;Are you okay? Nothing hurting?&quot; He questioned. The child blinked a few times, confused. &quot;U-Umm...&quot;\n>  &quot;Hold that thought.&quot; \n>  Reaching around, he grabbed a curved knife tied to his belt and toss it behind him. He held onto the rope as the blade swung and sliced into the man&#039;s leg as he was trying to sneak up to stab him. Eyes glaring yellow behind him.\n>  The large man fell down, yelling in pain as the boy calmly caught the knife as it swung back around, nearly hitting him. \n>  &quot;You were saying?&quot; The boy was overly confused, watching those eyes go back to a comforting blue colour. He nervously shakes his head to say he wasn&#039;t hurt. This seem to please the older boy as his eye seem to shine brighter. &quot;You&#039;re not? That&#039;s good.&quot; \n>  \n>  He stood up, patting his knees and pants of dirt. He walked over to the pained man and kicked him down before digging though his pockets. &quot;Here kid.&quot; The child was surprised when a pouch was suddenly toss to him, jiggling with coins. He looked at the pouch shocked before looking at the teen, his eyes back to blue and yellow. &quot;Keep it, buy some food, escape the walls and find a better place to live.&quot; The teen said standing up straight. &quot;That is unless you have a family here, then use that to help them.&quot; \n>  The child blinked confused before nodding in thanks, getting up from the dirt ground. The teen smiled once more, his eyes blue. &quot;Now get out of here. Guards will come by here soon.&quot; The teen smiled was the child ran off, taking one last look his way before disappearing into the dark streets.\n>  &quot;You son of a bitch, you&#039;ll pay for that.&quot; The man coughed before he chocked under the pressure of the teen&#039;s wolf like feet in his neck. &quot;Oh? I will, huh?&quot; He commented, looking down at the man with yellow eyes. &quot;I&#039;m afraid you&#039;ll never get that chance to make me pay.&quot; In a smooth motion, the boy was holding his blade again. The man shook with fear, unable to know why this THING was doing this. &quot;The guards will know of this! They will hunt you down!&quot;\n>  The teen flashed a smirk. Leaning down slightly, adding pressure to the man&#039;s throat. &quot;My dear friend, I don&#039;t know of you know this yet... But all of the Noxus army is going to hunt for me.&quot; He said lightly, taking his foot off the mans throat to stand over him. &quot;Do you know why?&quot; He spun two ropes lightly before stopping them, showing to exact blades in his hands. \n>  \n>  &quot;You&#039;re going to be my message to Swain.&quot;\n>  \n>  ------------------------------------------\n>  \n>  \n>  It was early in the morning, the knights were baffled by the discovery that was reported. A dead man laying on the cobblestone ground, wounds from both his neck and stomach. Yet that wasn&#039;t the part that baffled them.\n>  On the wall. In thick dried blood, words were written in three words.\n>  \n>  &quot;Death to Swain&quot;\n\n\nThis is the letter format which fits in with his certain appearance and lore idea.\n\n>  To my friends and family,\n>  \n>  It&#039;s been a long time since I disappeared all those years ago. \n>  I&#039;m sure you&#039;re wondering why I left without a word, without a sign.\n>  The answers you seek will become clear soon, but I have to point out certain things within our law.\n>  \n>  &#039;Only the strong survive.&#039; That is the motto we live with and carry in our hearts, but I learned something during my time with you all.\n>  \n>  The strongest have the weakest qualities.\n>  \n>  This is not me pointing you all out, but after living and talking to those who Noxus hold for such high regard. I couldn&#039;t help but notice your conflicting weaknesses.\n>  \n>  Some are too prideful, self-centred, loyal and who was once the strongest is slowly losing his strength with time.\n>  \n>  During my time outside the walls of Noxus, I realised my one weakness that I can&#039;t handle in times. The feeling of loneliness. \n>  But over time that weakness disappeared, my weakness is no longer existent. \n>  \n>  I am everything Noxus&#039;s views saw perfect, but Noxus is corrupting itself. \n>  What does it mean to be &#039;perfect&#039; to be &#039;the strong&#039;?\n>  Did it mean I sacrifice the lives of the people of Noxus in order to get what I want? To get what my &quot;general&quot; wants?\n>  I thought I was meant to protect these people, give everything for the sake of Noxus. But no, that&#039;s not what I was trained for. I was trained to give up everything for a man- no not a man, a crow.\n>  It was never for Noxus, it was never for the people, they never mattered. \n>  All that matters was the orders of a creature that was never Noxian nor human to begin with.\n>  \n>  Then again, neither am I.\n>  \n>  I&#039;m sorry it had to be this way, but I can&#039;t run away and do nothing about this. \n>  \n>  I know you won&#039;t ever understand, but this is going to be a war within our own walls, and it&#039;s time to pick sides.\n>   \n>  Who ever the winner will be, will decide Noxus&#039;s fate.\n>   \n>  Your old friend, \n>  Yut.\n\n\n{{champion:90}} {{champion:8}} \n\nSo, that&#039;s basically everything that we can show at the moment without making the post even longer then it has to. \nWe hope you like what we&#039;ve done, and we hope you can give your honest opinion on the character.","replies":[{"poster":"Coolbluey","date":"2016-01-20T04:44:55.468+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"its a furry","replies":[{"poster":"GenericPop","date":"2016-01-30T21:14:25.550+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"LOL I JUST SAID THAT xD","replies":[]},{"poster":"the4nr","date":"2016-01-20T06:04:23.123+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"{{champion:8}} yeah that was kind of intended since we dont know much about the country iona and also becuase we orignally had the idea for him to be more like ahri mixed with rengar, look wise of course with a bit more of a tooth and claw kit","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"unluckybunny","date":"2016-01-26T09:50:33.392+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Wow... That's amazing ^^ Honestly, I get ideas for champs time to time and want to make one, but I can never elaborate on it ;-; You guys did an amazing job and its obvious that a lot of effort was put into the art and lore for Yut. He looks like he's more fitted in for like an MMORPG rather than MOBA games though... His clothes don't exactly fit into a country ( Ionia's clothing styles are somewhat like East Asia, you get what I mean. )  I'd love to see more ideas from you guys and give feedback anytime :3","replies":[{"poster":"CheshireWolf","date":"2016-01-27T07:30:09.204+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thank you for the feedback. Making a champ is a lot more harder then one would think, since we want to keep to Riot's ideas that no champion can be the same. If want, you can share some ideas with me and the4nr. We'll be more then happy to hear what kind of ideas you have :3\n\nI've been getting some feedback, saying that Yut doesn't appear to fit into League. The style of LoL if somewhat difficult to recreate for me, Yut was different in a  sense, as I tried to mix Ionia with Noxus with his appearance. Didn't appear to work out too well in getting the feel of a LoL champion, but I'm still happy of what we made and I'm glad you like as well as others do too.","replies":[{"poster":"unluckybunny","date":"2016-01-27T10:38:46.696+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"<3 I'd be really happy if you guys would listen to ideas that I have ( HONESTLY I WISH YOU GUYS COULD CREATE A CHAMP WITH THOSE SMALL IDEAS ;-; ) Friend me on league maybe? haha {{sticker:slayer-jinx-wink}}","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Horizonn","date":"2016-01-21T08:54:23.030+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey im in the process of creating my own champion kit etc...

I found it hard to get the 'feel' of league into him, but it's difficult when the themes changes depending on where they come from. Since Yut lived in Noxus, but originate Ionia, I tried to mix those two themes together. Seems like it didn't work all that well, but I'm still proud of what we made.","replies":[]}]}]}
