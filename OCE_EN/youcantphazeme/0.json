He requires a huge amount of skill to be anywhere near effective, in my opinion no one below plat should even try picking him up unless they want to play just for fun, there are similar junglers that require much less skill. 2. Everyone complained about him for so long that they nerfed him into oblivion, and then when no one was complaining they nerfed him again. The only reason he is played in the LCS and high level play is because of the very early vision control he can supply, and because when a player has perfected lee sin they can stomp soloq games consistently, but you may have noticed in the pro scene that lee has a very low win rate. If he is ever to return to \"viable\" status for the average player or LCS, they will need to undo they nerfs to his W and his E. Thus not increasing his damage allowing him to win every dual, but giving him somewhat of a late game with being able to slow the enemy adc's attack speed and be able to use his W more often in a team fight.","replies":[{"poster":"GigaPube","date":"2015-06-11T15:09:12.962+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"\"use his W more often in a team fight\" wtf did i just read lol. his w is a 14 second cd and its the last spell i wanna use in a teamfight. do u even lee sin bruh?","replies":[{"poster":"Crowd Pleasa","date":"2015-06-11T16:09:04.614+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Actually, his W cd is only 7 second when using it on allies, and the nerf made it so it was 14 seconds when jumping to w ward. This means if you initiate the team fight with your W you most likely will not have the W back up for the duration of the team fight, which could normally be used to effectively peel for your adc. (Initiate with a ward jump and kick, kill the person you kicked, W onto your ADC and use your slow to defend off anyone on him). And yes i do lee sin, and i can guarantee i know more about him and this game than you \"bruh\". You wondering why anyone would use lee sins w in a team fight just shows how clueless you are.","replies":[{"poster":"GigaPube","date":"2015-06-13T10:52:34.278+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"the shield lasts for 2 seconds, what peeling? initiate with w?!?!? oh right then you can q out, oh wait no you cant herpderp, OH BUT DONT WORRY YOU ALWAYS HAVE FLASH EVERY 5 MINUTES BUT IF YOU DONT YOU DIE BUT OH WELL ALL THE PROS DIE BUT ITS ALWAYS MY TEAMS FAULT ANYWAY IM LEE SONG IM THA BEST JUNGLA IN THA GAME HURRDURR BEST AP LEE SONG CARDBOARD VII ON DA PLAN NET","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Exhausted","date":"2015-06-12T03:09:51.025+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Nah he doesnt fit too well atm.","replies":[]},{"poster":"GigaPube","date":"2015-06-11T15:22:11.545+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"lee sin will always be somewhat viable. if you play him close to what the pros do (or did), you gank and counterjungle as well as you can then its up to your team, really not much to say. \nhowever in this \"meta\", if you choose to respect it, the cinderhulk enchantment is probably undoubtedly the most efficient jungle item. \nsolo queues especially last even longer than pro games usually which only makes cinderhulk even more effective than how the pros utilise it (more health into the latter of the game)\nwhile you're building full tank, its much more gold efficient to feed into the 25% bonus health that comes with the cinderhulk than buying a possibly 3k gold damage item.\nso most people are and should be building full tank items onto their cinderhulk junglers. \nnow they cant do damage, and they can only tank, whats left for them to do? crowd control\nthe strongest junglers are naturally tanky ones that can clear jungle camps well but also have a lot of crowd control in their kit\nthis is why you're seeing the strongest junglers being gragas sejuani amumu zac and common junglers like lee sin rengar nocturne khazix not doing well\nthe pros that have still played lee sin have probably always built cinderhulk, but now hes used more for his mobility and jungle control\nid imagine you cant gank a lane as full tank lee sin without some cc in the ganked lane of the laner on your team","replies":[]}]}
