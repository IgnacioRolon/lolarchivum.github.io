To explain they&#039;re very mean, negative to not only just the other team but also their own. They will put us down as well as making us suffer with bullying the other team. I have blocked almost every silver I&#039;ve been placed with as their attitude is very off putting and they come into lobbies with people who aren&#039;t even a rank yet and make it torture and impossible for us to learn. \r\nThank you for listening to my concerns, I hope this issue gets resolved and league is better for everyone :)\r\nP.s nerf Illaoi lol jk :P\r\n\r\nLove from a big fan Dopechikk.","replies":[{"poster":"DopeChikk","date":"2016-01-23T10:01:59.191+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The Queen of Blades (Riot Games Player Support) \n\nJan 19, 22:57 \n\n\nGreetings Summoner,\n\nWe make frequent updates to our Matchmaking program in order to improve matchups. However, even the best Summoners can have a bad game. Taken as a system, players generally compete with other players of similar skill. Occasionally, bad matchups do happen, and we implement new methods when we find them to improve matchmaking. For example, your total number of wins in each queue is taken into account, so when you play Summoner's Rift, you will play against players with a similar number of wins.\n\nMatchmaking is not remotely affected by a player's behaviour. The system doesn't account for toxicity in pairing players together, nor does it forcibly pair toxic players with other toxic players. We work very hard to educate and help players reform, but we don't believe it's beneficial to separate players based on their behaviour. If you're finding yourself paired with toxic players, please don't hesitate to use the report feature at the end of the game. Doing so will help us identify and punish toxic players.\n\nFor details on matchmaking, check out our Knowledge Base:\nhttps://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752954\n\nIf you feel improvements could be made to the matchmaking system, you can contact matchmaking@riotgames.com with your ideas.\n\nAlso, I appreciate your feedback. I suggest you post this in our Boards.\n\nOCE: http://boards.oce.leagueoflegends.com/\n\nIf you have other concerns, please let me know. Best of luck on the Fields of Justice.\n\nThe Queen of Blades\n Player Support Specialist\n Frost Archer of Freljord","replies":[]},{"poster":"Proxima Solaris","date":"2016-01-22T05:22:50.896+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"i think the biggest thing to learn is seeing where you went wrong and actually taking responsibility for screw ups. the problem most people have is they assume someone else is always at fault. someone else might be, but if you start to look at screw ups as things you yourself could have prevented, your own negativity drops a lot and that rubs off on others. won't cure everything, but it does help~","replies":[]},{"poster":"Talon12","date":"2016-01-22T05:43:28.072+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"play heroes of the storm then, legit 99.99999999997% less toxicity than league, the game play is faster and more interactive, riot should learn a thing or 2 from blizzard","replies":[]},{"poster":"IMAFIRINMAHLAZER","date":"2016-01-22T03:50:25.603+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It is not exclusive to Silver.
