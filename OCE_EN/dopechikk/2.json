How cool would it be to have a Garen or Tryndamere project skin. \r\nMy points as to why is firstly they are a top lane champs and tank(I understand there are other tanks in the project Bunch but nothing like these 2)\r\nSecond Tryndamere is married to Ashe for political purposes (poor Tryn) so it would be cool to see them together on the project team.\r\n Garen is a mighty fine gentlemen who wants nothing but the best to serve justice for Demacia, Gazza for my guess has a thing with Kat even though they are enemies I have a feeling there maybe something more, how cool would it be for Garen to go against others and side with Kat on the project team.\r\nWell just a thought I&#039;d like to put out there and see what others think.\r\nEven though I know it has no impact I just think they would look awesome in a project skin! \r\nPs I know they both have a heap already.","replies":[]}
