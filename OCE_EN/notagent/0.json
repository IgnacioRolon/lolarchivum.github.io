{"poster":"NotAGent","date":"2015-02-16T10:00:43.106+0000","title":"Just an idea","subforum":"Miscellaneous","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"As everyone knows there are some summoner spells that just aren't used anymore, and are pretty much useless in the current meta (revive, clairvoyance etc..) so I came up with an idea that I think would be cool. As we know the blue trinket is pretty much clairvoyance (minus the global range of course) but it still makes the spell useless in its own, especially as other summoner spells are of higher necessity in the current meta (flash, exhaust, ignte, heal) To bring back clairvoyance in to the meta, i was thinking making the active global (as it already is) but having it so it can be teleported to. I know this sounds rediculous at first thought, but it would bring a new potential in team fights/split pushing. Sure we all know the drop a ward and get the top laner to tp to it before/during a team fight, but these can easily be cleared or dodged. I think it would be cool as it opens new ways to use tp, whether its to cut fleeing enemies off through an unwarded jungle, or to enter a team fight from a split push, and of course having clairvoyance can help during laning faze to check for ganks or jungler position (but let's be honest its a waste of a summoner spell just for that). If it is still too weak in the current meta, maybe cut back the timer on tp if its used on clairvoyance (as it is on structures) or give bonus attributes to either spell,  I would like to hear other players thoughts on my idea, good or bad I don't mind just had a thought that could open new possibilities :) {{summoner:2}} {{summoner:12}}","replies":[{"poster":"KingDinger","date":"2015-02-16T23:39:35.864+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"the biggest issue is the massive buff blue trinket just got with its upgrade placing a ward....if CV did that always, then that would make it much more useful. and also serve the purpose of the TP potential you requested.","replies":[{"poster":"NotAGent","date":"2015-02-18T09:01:47.146+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yeah I just think riot's looking past some of the basic spells and enveloping them into other game items/buffs too much (blue trinket and pretty much ignite on 5th dragon) I just think it'd be cool to see some summoner spells reworked to create new possibilities :)","replies":[{"poster":"KingDinger","date":"2015-02-18T23:49:10.979+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"5th dragon is a better red buff minus the slow....not ignite....\n\nbut yes, buffs to the weaker summoners would be nice. rather than just removing revive....","replies":[{"poster":"NotAGent","date":"2015-02-19T01:00:28.740+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yeah I do know that, it's just minus the grevious wounds, I just meant in general though alot of spells are just discarded now days, if someone was to name a team comp you could pretty much pick the summoners that they'd all take, I just want some variety :)","replies":[{"poster":"KingDinger","date":"2015-02-19T03:24:32.136+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"except its on hit....ignite isnt on hit....\n\none time application of a DOT that reduces healing during the DOTs duration.....compared to on hit DOT that works on all targets hit for the duration of the buff.....and on hit DOT that works on all targets for the duration of the buff, plus a slow.\n\nwhich 2 are similar?\n\nok, AOE wombo combo.\ntell me the summoners.\n\nhere, i will even do 5 champs i would choose. wont say roles or lanes. since you didnt specify that.\nkarthus orianna malphite MF J4.","replies":[{"poster":"NotAGent","date":"2015-02-19T04:12:03.824+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Ahahaha but I'm talking about the current meta for say lcs?
