However at 32% the patcher stopped and said \"Log error, Please check logs\" So i sent the logs away to riot having no clue what had happened. I've been playing LoL for around 3 years now without issue, so I was confused as to what went wrong. After searching countless forums, help pages and youtube videos i found a heap of different solutions. One was deleting the downloads and solutions files in the LoL file and copying an S_OK text into the LoL_Air_Client file inside RADS. I did this and then re opened the LoL patcher, but still the hated \"Log error\" at 32%. I then deleted LoL and every file on my computer to do with it, and re-downloaded it, after hours of waiting again \"Log error\". I then sent a ticket to riot, and had a helpfull staff member (Swizzle) give me many more ways to fix it. After trying all of these still Log error... I then tried to disable my firewall and antivirus, as my last resort and re-open the patcher, and it worked! Finally it started to update, at around 700Kbps, 2000 mgb down and only 266 to go and my download speed drops to 0kbps. At first i tried patching again, and had the same issue so i searched the web for help, and it turns out that when it drops to 0Kbps its just applying the patches, so I waited it out and sure enough it started to patch again. Finally it finished, after 3 long days of trying everything i can finally press the satisfying 'launch' button, and what do you know another issue. A message popped up saying:\n \"Application descriptor could not be found for this application, Try re-installing or contacting the publisher for assistance.\"\nSo again, i was stumped, I know nothing about computers so I had no clue what to do, I went back into the LoL_Air_Client folder and deleted the S_OK file, i then went into the LoL_patcher file and did the same. Re-opened the patcher and after scanning 100s of files the Launch button was available, with crossed fingers I clicked the button and FINALLY  IT WORKS!\nIf anyone needs help fixing any of the above problems comment and I will try my best :) ","replies":[{"poster":"ToxicHawk","date":"2015-02-11T22:22:13.523+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thanks for the update.\nAs the patcher and the client are 2 different processes, did you add an exception for both or just the game?","replies":[{"poster":"NotAGent","date":"2015-02-12T19:53:21.362+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yeah I have an exception for LoL Patcher, but still have to turn firewall/AV off to update","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"ToxicHawk","date":"2015-02-09T04:16:11.348+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey NotAgent,\n\nAwesome work. Its not very often I get to read a post about issues a player has been having and them solving it mostly themselves.\n\nThe first thing I noticed was you having to disable your firewall/anti virus. It seems that which ever AV you are using is actively blocking league of legends or at least our patcher.\n\n- Can you let me know what AV you are currently using?\n- Is it possible for you to add an exception into your firewall/AV to allow our files?\n- Did you re-enable your firewall/AV with no issues to your playing?\n\nMy main concern is your security, while I want everyone to be able to play when ever they want, I want them to be able to do it safely and securely. You never know what could download to your computer when browsing the internet.\n\nAgain awesome work on troubleshooting your issues.\n\n-ToxicHawk","replies":[{"poster":"NotAGent","date":"2015-02-11T22:13:22.629+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey there, I'm using avast free antivirus, and yes I've made an exception for League, it doesn't effect me in game but it seems to be blocking the patcher.
