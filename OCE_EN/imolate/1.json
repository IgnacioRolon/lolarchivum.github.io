I&#039;m running a 4690/gtx970/8gb 1600mhz ram. 128gb mxcrucial SSD.\r\n\r\nAll my drivers are up to date.. I have ran 3dmark and heaven benchmark for a couple of hours on end, I have no issues running these benchmarks.. I have recently just re-formatted in attempt to fix this.. then its happened again.\r\n\r\nOriginally I thought it was a GPU issue as the first time It ever done it my nvidia driver crashed.. but since then I&#039;m just getting bugsplats =\\\r\n\r\nI&#039;ve contacted riot via ticket but they&#039;re basically no help.. can anyone help me with this issue?","replies":[{"poster":"HORSE OF FORCE","date":"2015-04-20T12:04:23.089+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Cheese has his own discussion about it, if you need context.
