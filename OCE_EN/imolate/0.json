In Google chrome go Settings > advanced settings; untick both \"use hardware acceleration when available\" and \"use application while Google chrome is closed\".\n2. Right click on your desktop and select Nvidia control panel. Go to 3D settings > manage 3D settings on the side. Then find the program settings tab. Find \"League of Legends\" under the program to customise drop down list and click \"restore\". Don't worry if you can't click restore it just means they're already set to the default settings. Now go to where it says \"select the preferred graphics processor for this program:\" and select \"high performance NVIDIA processor\". Now scroll down and change the following settings; \nCUDA - GPUs and change it to \"use these GPUs - GeForceGTX970\"\nPower management mode \"prefer maximum performance\"\n\nI think this is all the changes I made to mine, I can check and confirm when I get home tonight. Also make sure your graphics drivers are up to date.\n\nI'm tentative at saying this is a solution because I haven't confirmed its a complete fix for me but from what I've found it helps.
