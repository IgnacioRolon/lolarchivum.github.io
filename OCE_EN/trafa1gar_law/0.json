Reasons for this are the following:\r\ni liked setting up funny teams based on global ults or mass murdering cc (which was fair since others had that option)\r\ni also like playing the same few champs like Riven (basically just riven) and nasus, etc. typical fun top laners. \r\ni only got Riven once in URF and it was really upsetting since i vsed a lot of them. Anyway that&#039;s my opinion and i hope Riot takes notice. :)","replies":[{"poster":"Fitzky","date":"2017-03-05T03:52:22.817+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yeah unfortunately all you're gonna get is flame no one cares about having fun anymore they're just toxic over people picking zed and riven in a game mode that isn't suppose to be taken seriously. Who cares if you have to play against a zed every game you should be having fun playing who you want regardless of who is on the enemy team.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Azirious Mistake","date":"2017-03-12T08:22:45.767+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Noone wants to wait another 2 mins to get into a game of URF, when I wanna play URF, i want to get in there quick-smart.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Project Xayah","date":"2017-03-06T08:21:32.602+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It would honestly be better if it was some kind of combination between the randomness of ARURF and the Draft style of URF. Something like; you get randomly assigned X amount of champions, based on how many you own (or better yet, out of the entire pool), and then get to choose who you want out of them. It would address the \"lack of diversity\" problem of URF while also addressing the \"lack of control\" problem of ARURF.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Devils Advocate","date":"2017-03-06T06:46:59.891+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Imo draft- purely because AR is so shittily random, it feels like i waste 4-5 games just trying to get a reasonable one, which by the time it happens.. I'm pretty much over it and i head back to ARAM and just AR without URF.","replies":[]},{"poster":"FatedSaviour","date":"2017-03-06T01:01:12.438+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"the vote is 50-50, riot, have both queues open, pleases everyone","replies":[]}]}
