Begrudgingly,  I bought the same skin as a gift to my friend afterwards.\r\nI just threw away more than  $10 for a champion I don&#039;t even play, a skin i did not  want.\r\nImmediately. Submitted a ticket to riot, and they told me they would not give me a refund unless i had tokens.\r\nProblem is, I used those tokens 2-3 years before. How is that reasonable? I am never able to refund ever again? I can&#039;t get my head around it,  Shouldn&#039;t it be something around &quot;you can refund twice per year&quot;? This way everyone is happy and more inclined to buy something. This is like going into a store to buy something, and the store refusing a refund or an exchange for an unopened purchase right afterwards.\r\nI am not pissed, just disappointed.  This would just make things  more reasonable and _moralï¼Ÿ_","replies":[{"poster":"Devils Advocate","date":"2016-10-21T21:05:35.773+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Every 20th RP bought RP item also unlocks a refund token. \n\nWe've all got that 1 in 10/20 purchase that doesn't remotely come close to the art/video/image we had in our head then loaded on our game it was like \"meh could have lived without that\"","replies":[{"poster":"Devils Advocate","date":"2016-10-21T21:08:11.051+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=ToTaL ViRGiN,realm=OCE,application-id=Ntey9fRZ,discussion-id=2oF3RsuH,comment-id=0004,timestamp=2016-10-21T21:05:35.773+0000)\n>\n> Every 20th RP bought RP item also unlocks a refund token. \n> \n> We&#x27;ve all got that 1 in 10/20 purchase that doesn&#x27;t remotely come close to the art/video/image we had in our head then loaded on our game it was like &quot;meh could have lived without that&quot;\n\nedit; or, for every 10400rp you spend you unlock a refund token. Cmon Riot, thats 20 $5 rp purchases or 1 $100 rp purchase... Seems reasonable to me for the amount of champ/skin/ward etc choices there are and now and then everyone's made a mistake, and the 1st 3 refund tokens are never 100% appreciated unless its an experienced 2nd account","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Corehog","date":"2016-10-20T15:19:57.219+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'm going to play the role of devil's advocate here, as I think a point needs to be made about refunds.\n\nWhen you begin playing League of Legends, Riot give you 3 refund tokens, which you can use for any purchase at any time. Riot are giving you these as a sign of good faith. Remember, Riot are a company , they want to make money and they do not have to give a refund (in Australia at least) as all products sold on the client are \"fit for purpose\", as per Australian refund law.\n\nAs I said previously, Riot give these tokens to every player as a sign of good faith, and as \"get out of jail\" free cards. You buy a skin, realise it looks like shit or you don't like the champ, use a token. You are only given 3, and are warned every time you use one, as Riot want you to be sure that you do want what you are buying.\n\nYes, you may of bought the skin accidentally, but Riot have already bailed you out three times previously. \n\n\nMy suggestions are:\n\n- Learn the champ and use the skin.\n- Play ARAMs, hopefully get said champ, be able to use the skin\n- Learn from your mistakes and move on","replies":[]},{"poster":"BananaSlayerAMO","date":"2016-10-20T09:39:43.970+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Although two refunds a year might be a bit much, I agree that there should be a way for dedicated customers to earn refunds back. People who have played for years or spent many thousands of RP shouldn't be stuck with no refunds forever just because they used up the tokens.\n\nMaybe refunds can be earned back after someone has spent a certain amount of RP, or played a certain amount of games.","replies":[]},{"poster":"ASH IS 1","date":"2016-10-20T09:07:14.410+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I certainly  think this is a great idea I was also thinking that my self multiple times and I also know many players who think so aswel. The thing is we pay real life money most cases and we should have more than 3 refunds in a life time, realistically speaking 3 refunds a year sounds more reasonable.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Vexenite","date":"2016-10-20T08:17:45.444+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"pretty sure the refunds are there to give you a few free passes for your mistakes.
