Help?","subforum":"Miscellaneous","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"This has happened in 3 games now, and it is entirely game breaking. The first time it happened at the end of the game and wasn't resolved, the 2nd was the first 20ish minutes of the game before it miraculously fixed itself (still long enough to screw me over for the rest of the game) and the last time started halfway through an ARAM and wasn't resolved. These have been in the space of about 6 games inclusive. \r\n\r\nThe issue is, randomly I lose the ability to upgrade abilities, access the pause menu, click on the map to recenter the camera, space to centre camera stops working, can look at shop but not buy, and cannot use summoner spells. There are only 3 things you can do - attack move, type in chat and use pre-unlocked abilities. You can see that it is attack move from the red click marker instead of the normal green. If you hadn't unlocked any abilities (like in the 2nd game) before it starts, bad luck, you're going to be autoattacking a lot this game, which is hard to do as Swain, because you can't unlock them. Attack move also means that once you start attacking something, you can't stop until the unit dies, so there are a lot of unnecessary dives as I frantically bash my mouse in the other direction. The game is unplayable. How can I fix this? I haven't figured out how to recreate the bug yet, as entering a game right now is akin to AFK'ing, since my team has to deal with a potato who can't do anything. \r\n\r\nIt's fairly hard to capture this in a screenshot, but I've done my best. As you can see, I have 5786 gold because I can't purchase anything in the shop, and 8 ability unlock points. This was taken from the 3rd game, and the bug started halfway through the ARAM, leaving me with just the items and abilities I had bought/unlocked after my first death. You can see my click is red, being an attack move, as well. How can I fix this?","replies":[{"poster":"justatinynoob","date":"2016-05-13T07:10:43.513+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Has anyone found a fix to this?

It seems to really happen when I try type in ALL chat. I think shift is the reason why it actually does that. I am unsure and that is yet to be tested, but for now, when I don't type in ALL chat, it doesn't happen.\nHowever, for me reconnecting did work, although it really kills the game when you take 10 mins to reconnect.","replies":[{"poster":"Lyranne","date":"2015-04-29T04:26:45.839+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yeah right shift key is your culprit, I think. it was happening to me and I was very confused but I noticed it happened immediately after I sent a message, and I fumbled to find the return key. right shift is directly underneath.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Lyranne","date":"2015-04-29T04:25:23.185+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"This seems to happen to me when I press the right shift key (this is on a mac keyboard), and it goes back to normal when I press it again.

The only clicking that works is moving around, but its only attack click. Also as a side note if you get too close to minions while this is happening its like a black hole, you auto attack them and can't run. Reloading into game fixes it for a short period of time, but then it starts back up again?","replies":[]},{"poster":"Sackboy","date":"2015-03-21T12:08:27.310+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Attack move manually, or reconnect.","replies":[{"poster":"Dael em","date":"2015-03-21T12:12:49.753+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Tried both, neither work","replies":[{"poster":"Sackboy","date":"2015-03-21T12:14:19.493+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Dael em,realm=OCE,application-id=Ntey9fRZ,discussion-id=4Kmfo849,comment-id=00000000,timestamp=2015-03-21T12:12:49.753+0000)\n>\n> Tried both, neither work\n\nWhat exactly did you do to get stuck in attack move?

The only input that the game will respond to is a mouse click on terrain, which is carried out as an attack move, the enter key to type in chat, and QWER FD buttons. Other than that, nothing else works. I can't access the menu, click on the map, spacebar doesn't change the camera, I can't ping, I can't level up abilities (the button shortcut for this doesn't work either) and I can't shop. Those are just the ones off the top of my head, but it's pretty much everything that doesn't work. \n\nOh and the \"continue\" button at the defeat/victory screen doesn't work, meaning I have to alt tab out and force quit the game after I finish.","replies":[{"poster":"JasonWazza","date":"2015-03-21T14:27:53.149+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Add the following to the file and see if it works\n\n[HUDEvents]   \nevtOnUIMouse1 = [Button 1]\n\nThis *Should* allow you to left click your Hud, not sure if the config stuff is different on mac (also i just clipped in the bits that i was thinking you should check, mines like 50 lines due to custom keys)","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]}
