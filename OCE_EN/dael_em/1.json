This particular instance, I got placed in the lower priority queue because I stood in base, not wanting to play the ranked game as I had two trolls running down midlane from the start of the game. There is no two ways about it, they were deliberately feeding. I did not leave, I did not AFK, I simply did not participate in their feeding, and now I am being punished. Prior to this, I have not had any leaves this season (bar maybe 1) and now I am being punished for the second time. Is anyone else finding this? I am so fed up with being punished for not doing anything wrong. Check my match history, no leaves. Now I sit here having to wait 10 minutes every time I try to queue up for a game, on top of just having a ranked provisional lost for me.","replies":[{"poster":"Project Xayah","date":"2015-03-08T09:13:08.478+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"> because I stood in base\n\nSo, you admit to AFKing?

I know you mentioned there were trolls and that you stayed in base so as to \"not participate in their trolling\" but that's irrelevant. **You** broke the rules, therefore **you** got punished. Assuming you reported those trolls they should also get punished for their actions.\n\n> I chose not to participate in their feeding by staying in base\n\nBecause you had to stay in base to choose not to participate in their feeding? You couldn't play the game while choosing not to participate in their feeding? Sounds like an excuse to me. Also makes it sound like you choose to feed on occasion.\n\n> That is not going AFK.\n\nSo standing in base doing nothing isn't AFKing? That's not how it works. If you're not participating in a game then you're AFK. That simple. Fact: leavebuster recognises a person standing in base as AFK, which is what you've admitted to doing.\n\n> Even if I had gone AFK, that would be the 2nd time in one week I've been punished, even though I have not AFK'ed this entire season.\n\nIf you believe you've been wrongly punished by leavebuster it's your responsibility to bring that to Riots attention. Either you were punished for disobeying the rules, which means you're wrong (and is likely the case given what you've admitted to in this thread) or leavebuster got it wrong, which is a less likely possibility.","replies":[]}]}]}]}
