These 4 feederbot carry matches are actually a very good practice mode for training in snowballing and mechanical focused gameplay. Snowball and hard carry the game faster than the 4 bots can feed and lose it and the riot bots group up and the feeder bots are useless as even cannon fodder.\n\nI like to consider coop vs ai as it's own gamemode with the nickname: 'One Man Army'.\n Carry hard and fast, or lose it all.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Slowdownn","date":"2016-10-19T23:37:29.796+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I find it challenging as normally, 5 human could be too one sided.","replies":[]}]}
