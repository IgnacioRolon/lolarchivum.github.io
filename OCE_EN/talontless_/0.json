For instance counterjungling and being counterjungled and trying to setup vision for a surprise assassination or ambush for a counter gank is exceptionally fun for assassin players, playing around with bushes and try to out juke your opponent or escape and then predict where you can circle round and get revenge is very entertaining. Being oneshot isn't especially fun, but it becomes alot more exciting when both players can 1shot the other, and so it becomes a game of patience and reaction speed, and a shaco and khazix playing a game of hide and seek in the jungle is alot more exciting and interactive than being malzahar ulted.\n\nOn the other hand in say the assassin vs adc matchup, it's still kind of fun for the assassin, trying to find a way to sneak in, burst the adc and leg it before their team notices, but for the adc it's not especially interactive since alot of the peel and defense they have is focused on the support and tanks, and not being ambushed relies alot on the team setting up proper vision control. \n\nStill this is how the matchup is supposed to be, and it would be like complaining that knights are too good at forking and slipping through defensive pawn formations in chess. Assassins have strengths and weaknesses, and since they offer nothing to a traditional teamcomp, their role is to assassinate the backline and pick off enemies out of position.","replies":[{"poster":"JasonWazza","date":"2017-11-12T05:14:56.969+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Well i mean, they are only fun for an ahead assassin, put 2 assassin's against each other, and watch the one behind hate being an assassin, because they can't even 1-shot the ADC.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"BarryButcher","date":"2017-11-11T06:04:05.905+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Because Assassins are a pain to deal with and require coordination to stop which is lacking in solo que.\n\nAssassins when strong 1 shot ADC and Supps and burst tanks so low they have to leave fights instantly making them useless.

And kayn usually uses his e to engage ganks anyway, no more escape, same with talon, he flips over wall to initiate but doesn't flip back out, gets his burst then runs away in many scenarios without a reliable escape, because even if he does use r, he loses the invis if his w is still in flight, as the returning w removes his stealth","replies":[{"poster":"tts01008","date":"2017-11-16T12:01:30.879+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You still didn't explain how talon not able to flip **another** wall after finishing his job.","replies":[{"poster":"Talon12","date":"2017-11-16T12:39:46.150+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"botlane or toplane ganks usually end up with him flipping the wall in then cant flip out, and mid lane, as soon as he appears, any form of cc stuffs him and makes flips useless as it either cancels them and puts it on cd, prevents them or makes the flip so slow you can slap him to death as rakan.

And flips and stuff will destory him when flipping because he is registered in that spot he initally flipped from until he lands, so if he is even 0.01 seconds from landing and a singed, hecarim or vayne e hits him he is sent right back to the start, same with hard cc like stuns, snares or silences.
