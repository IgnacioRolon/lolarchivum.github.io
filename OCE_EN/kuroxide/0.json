He hadn&#039;t been playing LOL for about 2 days, and I know for a fact he wasn&#039;t scripting. He sent a support ticket but they said there&#039;s nothing they can do about his permaban. Is there any way for my brother to get his account unbanned?\n\nHis IGN is CyborgNeenja if that helps","replies":[{"poster":"Project Xayah","date":"2017-06-24T12:33:02.623+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Based on the info you've provided, the ban has already been appealed and the appeal has already been denied. At this point, the account is completely irretrievable.\n\nAs for what triggered the ban, it could be any number of kinds of 3rd party software, not necessarily scripting software. While \"aesthetic\" mods have been on a \"use at your own risk\" basis previously, Riot did announce plans to change that around the middle of *this* season, so if your brother was using any kind of client mods, regardless of purpose, that could have triggered the ban. There also seems to be several seemingly benign programs that trigger these kinds of bans, could be he was using one of them. It could also have come about from several other scenarios, such as a possible \"unauthorised access\" to the account, or if the account (or login details) were shared with someone else.","replies":[{"poster":"KuroXide","date":"2017-06-25T06:17:31.570+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"He wasn't using any 3rd party mods.

If he wants to appeal his case, he should send in a [support ticket](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/requests/new) to Riot. \nFrom now its basically a waiting game.\n\nHere are some guidelines for submitting a support ticket that will ensure the smoothest and fastest response possible:\n\n> Please create a max of 1 ticket about this issue, and do not try to add any information afterwards/submit multiple as it will bump it to the back of the queue. It can take up to 7 business days for them to get back to you (although majority of tickets are answered within 48 hours), so be patient","replies":[{"poster":"KuroXide","date":"2017-06-25T06:16:21.249+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"as I said, he has already sent in a support ticket and it was denied.","replies":[]}]}]}
