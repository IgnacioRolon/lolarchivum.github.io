A little backstory, we were playing norms and I locked in teemo jungle. No big deal, we all started the game normally. I realised that we had a lee sin adc, and questioned him about it but didn&#039;t continue with any insults or harrassment. A bit of banter as I continued through my first clear, after which I ganked bot and taxed their lane for a bit. My botlaners decided to call me out and start taking my camps, of course in a playful and hilarious matter. So we decided that since they are winning lane hard we would rush to see who could clear the camps the fastest, as they were always there to take them. \r\n\r\nI told them to be useful and take scuttle if they&#039;re gonna take my camps, in which they replied no and started taking the enemy jungle. I asked why, as I thought they were only taking mine and they said the &quot;price of taxing our lane has increased&quot; (not exact words) and started taking more camps. I got annoyed when they started taking my buffs, and told them to go away (of course, I really couldn&#039;t care less. It was all playful and I didn&#039;t mean any insults towards them in any way.) The enemy team said their twitch did no damage, so I said &quot;it&#039;s cause he&#039;s 0/10&quot; and started getting fucked by the enemy azir. This continued to the end of the game and I got banned afterwards.\r\n\r\nAnother reminder, my &quot;insults&quot; and &quot;disrespectful language&quot; towards my 2 botlaners was completely for jokes and banter and I didn&#039;t mean it at all.\r\n\r\nComms Below \\/ \\/ \\/\r\n\r\nExcalibyte: fast as fuck\r\nExcalibyte: lee sin adc?\r\nExcalibyte: lolwut\r\nExcalibyte: you better know what ur doing\r\nExcalibyte: cause I don&#039;t\r\nExcalibyte: dance til ur ded\r\nExcalibyte: doo doo doo doo\r\nExcalibyte: choo choo\r\nExcalibyte: teemo train\r\nExcalibyte: gj\r\nExcalibyte: aaa\r\nExcalibyte: hi\r\nExcalibyte: thanks for letting me tax\r\nExcalibyte: bye now\r\nExcalibyte: no\r\nExcalibyte: wow\r\nExcalibyte: rude\r\nExcalibyte: nooo\r\nExcalibyte: that&#039;s mah shit\r\nExcalibyte: cuck off\r\nExcalibyte: shh\r\nExcalibyte: still\r\nExcalibyte: do it then\r\nExcalibyte: pussy\r\nExcalibyte: be useful and take skuttle\r\nExcalibyte: jesus\r\nExcalibyte: thought you said my jungle\r\nExcalibyte: ???\r\nExcalibyte: gtfo\r\nExcalibyte: 3 camps\r\nExcalibyte: there\r\nExcalibyte: lmao\r\nExcalibyte: 2 for 1\r\nExcalibyte: gj\r\nExcalibyte: golems?\r\nExcalibyte: kurgs?\r\nExcalibyte: uh\r\nExcalibyte: mmk\r\nExcalibyte: no\r\nExcalibyte: outplayed\r\nExcalibyte: bye\r\nExcalibyte: kys\r\nExcalibyte: NO\r\nExcalibyte: FUCK OFF\r\nExcalibyte: NO\r\nExcalibyte: OMG\r\nExcalibyte: suck\r\nExcalibyte: me\r\nExcalibyte: dry\r\nExcalibyte: nah\r\nExcalibyte: kys\r\nExcalibyte: lel\r\nExcalibyte: bye azir\r\nExcalibyte: fuck me\r\nExcalibyte: kys\r\nExcalibyte: no\r\nExcalibyte: jesus\r\nExcalibyte: cause he 0/10\r\nExcalibyte: nooo\r\nExcalibyte: azir just does so much damage\r\nExcalibyte: azir got buffed way too hard\r\nExcalibyte: WTF\r\nExcalibyte: he does so much fucking damage\r\nExcalibyte: gg\r\nExcalibyte: lmao azir hard carry","replies":[{"poster":"Roguestoney","date":"2017-09-29T11:29:04.375+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"Deserved punishment learn from it and move on.","replies":[{"poster":"KuroXide","date":"2017-09-29T11:29:59.967+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Roguestoney,realm=OCE,application-id=T8eq2lFQ,discussion-id=0iszEmfd,comment-id=0002,timestamp=2017-09-29T11:29:04.375+0000)\n>\n> Deserved punishment learn from it and move on.\n\nplease read my post before commenting.
