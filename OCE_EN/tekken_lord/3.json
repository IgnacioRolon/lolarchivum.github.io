Just imagine a bot lane with vayne vs cait, with cait obviously having the upper hand and not only denying cs from vayne by pushing/bullying her but on top  of it denying the minions by hitting them. It's just not fair and not balanced to do something like that cause whoever has the early game can deny ALL the farm frmo the enemy. There is freezing and zoning for that, if you can't do that, don't ask for something more than this.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Daejel","date":"2015-03-31T20:26:59.786+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Because LoL isn't Dota 2.","replies":[{"poster":"Tekken Lord","date":"2015-04-15T07:20:59.954+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"THANK YOU CAPTAIN OBVIOUS I TRULY APPRECIATE YOUR ASSISTANCE THANK YOU AGAIN VERY GRATEFUL YES THANK YOU THANK YOU","replies":[]}]}]}
