The system doesn't ban people without reports.\n\nI'm sure many will disagree, but I think that many of the issues around mildly toxic players taking a while to get banned comes from a lack of people reporting. \n\nI know personally if I have a salty game I often just exit the lobby immediately and forget about it. Then 30 seconds later I'll remember that I forgot to report. And I know many of my friends simply don't report because they don't think it does anything. \n\nBoth these effects combined mean the system gets far less reports than it should. This is terrible because the system needs reports to function and learn from them. Don't take this the wrong way though, this is mostly Riot's fault. For a long time I have believed a lack of report feedback started this issue.\n\nOne thing though, muting every player who is toxic is 100% the correct way. We have so many players come through here every month who were banned because they didn't mute and instead tried to flame toxic summoners.","replies":[]}]}
