You main focus should be to set up the club with the help of whoever manages the PCs (usually the ICT teacher), and think about what the club will actually do. \n\n_Are you going to play a game of League during lunch?_\n_Are you going to play custom games/1v1s?_\n_Are you going to practice strategies and mechanics?_\n_Are you going to just have a cool place where people who enjoy League can chill out at lunch?_\n\nAlso if you're worried about low attendance, you might want to start a general gaming club first and **make sure you get an announcement in your school notices or at assembly!**\n\nGood luck man!","replies":[{"poster":"Tele","date":"2017-02-07T07:13:07.965+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Oh!
