Not too proud of the chatlogs tbh. Not sure if you can see the entire game chatlog or just mine but if you were told to repeatedly drink bleach and kill yourself for no apparent reason you'd kinda understand where my retaliation came from. The reason why I think is unjust because in all these instances I was simply retaliating to what someone else said. Never have I instigated an argument  if you can see from my logs.","replies":[{"poster":"MasterMirkinen","date":"2016-05-27T03:23:32.912+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"I did read all the chat log and yes, you may have not started but what would have happened if you were the bigger man and ignored / muted him?\nYou would have not escalated it and he would have have likely stopped provoking you. \nHe would have gotten his ban anyway and you wouldn't.","replies":[{"poster":"DJDilly","date":"2016-05-27T05:48:05.578+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yeah that obv would've been the case but it's easy to look at it in third person and say \"just ignore it\".
