However, all the friends that I play with are on the OCE server. Recently I bought 2 rp cards to be able to purchase Sona and her DJ skin, but then found out after buying them that they are region locked.\r\n\r\nI think that should be changed, that they should not be region locked because some of us that are playing in different regions than that in which we play in cannot redeem cards if we do not have a credit card. I want to be able to buy champions and skins, but I am unable to do so if I cannot use the cards.","replies":[{"poster":"HORSE OF FORCE","date":"2015-05-17T08:43:01.750+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":">if we do not have a credit card\n\nYou can still redeem RP without credit cards. Just use any form of money transfer that works over the net. This could be either mobile phone money, a debit card, or some sort of other, online account, such as Paypal.\n\nThe reason why the physical cards are region locked is to prevent their sale overseas. Mainly because $1 US â‰  $1 AU. In addition, not all regions have access to the same content (though, arguably, it's become nearly unnoticeable of late).\n\nJust remember this for the future. You *may* be able to get a refund from the store you purchased it from, though I'm not too clear on the laws of America concerning consumer rights.\n\nBest of luck.","replies":[]}]}
