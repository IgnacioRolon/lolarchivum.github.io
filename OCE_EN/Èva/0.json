Instead we are focusing on the OPL Final, which is our first standalone RIOT event in OCE.\n\nIf you already purchased a ticket to PAX prior to the 4th May 2015 we would like to offer you the skin you would have received by attending our booth at the show. Simply send us your proof of purchase and summoner name and we will validate the ticket with PAX and then gift you your skin directly. We will process skins once we have full ticket validation from PAX.\n\nPlease send all proof of purchase and summoner names to pax2015@riotgames.com","replies":[{"poster":"Èva","date":"2015-06-20T13:45:08.604+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It wasnt about the skin and free stuff, it was about the environment. Having the Riot staff there, watching the games, watching the limitless cosplay. Either way its disappointing that there wont at least be a booth. I am very disappointed that riot would not at least have something rather then nothing...\n\nAnd i dont like how they decided to announce it to people on a tiny little thread that led to the lunapark venue.","replies":[]},{"poster":"OhMyGawdzilla","date":"2015-09-08T02:46:25.020+0000","up_votes":0,"down_votes":0,"body":"What if I bought my ticket after 4th of may?
