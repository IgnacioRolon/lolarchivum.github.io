We play many different games and realized that more often than not, we don't have enough people to do what we want to. So we thought, \"There MUST be people out there with the same problems as us\". From this, Eternum was born. We aim to be an international community for gamers. Our goal is to allow like-minded individuals to enjoy their games with good company.\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**What we offer to you**\n\n**Multi-Platform Gaming.**\nWe are mainly a League of Legends community, but we support a varying amount of games, such as MMORPGs, FPS, RTS, even Card games. We have a variety of members that play all sorts of games, on all sorts of platforms. \n\n**Tournaments.**\nOnce we get a steady amount of active members, we will be hosting 1v1 Tournaments, through to 3v3 and 5v5s.\n\n**Teamspeak.**\nTeamspeak is the heart of the community, while all the members are the backbone. \nIt is our main form of communication. \nWe have channels that are dedicated to &#039;chilling out&#039;, where you can relax and talk to friends about your day and we also have rooms that are designed for ranked games as well, so people are respectful when it comes to privacy.\n\n**Safe Environment.**\nWe offer a safe environment, we DO NOT tolerate trolls or any form of misbehaving and causing your team grief.\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**STEPS TO JOIN**\n1.
