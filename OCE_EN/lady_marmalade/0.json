RIOT banned my account for MMR boosting which means someone login to my account and play games, but no one login to my account! I ve been playing normal game recently. Who cheats in normal games OMG! ? ! ? That s fuckin ridiculous. And I ve been in gold 5 0 points more than half year. If I cheat in rank, why am I still in gold 5 0 point? Does it make real sense? I spent more than $1000 on this account to buy skins, but now they removed my rank rewards and banned my account. I m not gonna play this fuckin game if they cannot solve this problem and they should refund all costs I spent.","replies":[{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2016-10-29T15:11:47.504+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"If you want the reason for your ban clarified then please submit a ticket to player support detailing your request: https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/requests/new","replies":[]}]}
