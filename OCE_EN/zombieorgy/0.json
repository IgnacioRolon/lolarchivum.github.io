This season I want to put in some hard yards and climb, hoping to get to silver at the least... Trouble is, I&#039;m losing most of my ranked games, i have a 20% win to loss ratio in ranked and I have only made it to about 60 lp before falling all the way back to 0 lp. \r\n\r\nI Feel so frustrated because I usually don&#039;t lose my lane, and I try my best to ward and help my team out but most of the games are loses, and usually are losses that should have been wins, I know I make mistakes and probably contribute to this, but I also feel like being in bronze V I teamed with absolute imbeciles that just throw game, and it&#039;s game after game, after game. I rage not in game so much but in person because it&#039;s just every time i play a ranked game. \r\n\r\nIts probably me, but I need advice, coaching, or someone/team to help me improve.\r\nI usually Mid, top, or Sup\r\n\r\nCheers\r\n\r\nZombieOrgy","replies":[{"poster":"Gloric","date":"2017-01-05T12:42:25.646+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I just watched a replay, now i'm not saying this represents all games, but I personally identified a few things I think might not be helping, or contributing, but first;\n\n- your focus on csing at the start is good, you don't waste mana on wave clearing unless you have to (you were playing Ahri), which is a positive, however, your cs did drop off after 10 minutes, to the point that Lux was double your cs at one point. I understand you were roaming but you should try to push lanes out if you're thinking of roaming. Stops your tower taking damage and squashing all your cs/gold income. And your laner coming back and using the unkilled minions to smash your tower more, also forces your laner to go back to lane rather than roaming themselves.\n\n- You often leave certain actions unpunished. For example you were surprised by Lux coming to top when you killed Poppy, she missed her Q as you walked around the corner and if you had have just attacked her, her E would have gone right by you and hit top lane, doing absolutely no damage. In that circumstance, attacking her would have been freelo (as the saying goes), she had no CD's and no way to stop you popping everything you had on her. You subsequently just turned around and run back into lane. I get that it was  a \"safe\" play as maybe the jungler was there, but in bronze, bets are there was zero coordination and the Lux was there without thinking of the consequences of being trapped by herself without a tower. ie. my tip here is to prioritize punishing missed skillshots and CDs and etc.. instead of playing the safer route, which I wouldn't always recommend as you climb higher, but in bronze it's a safer bet to allow you to secure gold and carry the game harder.\n\n- Same thing in lane, when facing someone like Lux, if she misses her Q, do all you can to lay in a full combo, practice that aspect even, baiting out CDs and going all-in for a kill. This works less on AA based champs as they can load out consistent damage, but for CD/combo reliant champs, missing a skillshot/stun/snare can mean a VERY dicey situation. (obviously this applied to you as well, a good player will all-in you if you miss your charm as Ahri, but alas, this is bronze, many players haven;'t got this programmed into their autopilot).\n\nHonestly your gameplay and mechanics seem fine enough, even the same as mine (and i'm silver and climbing with 60% winrate atm), but your capitalization on enemies making mistakes is one place I would say you should make improvements/think about actively for awhile.","replies":[{"poster":"zombieOrgy","date":"2017-01-15T19:23:59.872+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Solid advice man, cheers for that. Ive been spending more time on cs as Im only averaging around 3-5 per minute at the end of a game, which is far too low. I guess I am not prioritizing correctly, Ill often go roam bot only to have their midlaner push my tower hard, i shgould work on that.  Thanks for the advice","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"chichun2002","date":"2017-01-06T12:18:44.065+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Dude I feel u I'm stuck in b5 but I find it helps to take a break especially after u lose 2 games in a row and try again later when u are refreshed it stops u from losing all that hard earned Lp","replies":[]},{"poster":"Captain Fortune","date":"2017-01-05T12:00:35.901+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Greetings ZombieOrgy,\n\n\nOff of the information you have provided, the first piece of advice I can give you is when you are playing both Mid and Top Lane try to end the laning phase as soon as you can. By ending the laning phase you can roam around the map and help other lanes by ganking for them and making your team group.\n\n\nTry to focus on the bottom lane first as the bot tower will be the easiest to take down with two people normally in the lane along with ADCs amazing damage against tower. Along with this dragon will be an objective you can take down after a successful gank. When you are able to kill bottom tower as well you can tell bot to group with you and either group mid or top lane. Grouping when your team is ahead will help a ton for winning the game.\n\n\n---\n\n\nThe other thing to focus on is communication with your team. You noted on in your post how people in your game like to throw. In this sense try to give them guidance as to what to do in the late game. Keep them focused on what objectives to take next, where to group and how you want to team fight.\n\n\nTo note a bit more on how you want to team fights, give them reminders like if your or your ADC needs peel in the next fight or who the main focus is. Ping who to focus as you team fight as well. \n\n\nOther than that on the note of communication make sure you are also talking about vision with your team. Where you want to focus your wards (around objectives you are focusing or lanes you are pushing.)\n\n\n---\n\n\nAnother piece of advice I can give you would be if you notice that a certain member of your team is fed. Try to make your team rotate around them along your wards. You can do this yourself as well. For example if your top lane is fed and if you are a mid laner, try to stay around the top lane region to counter gank and stop them from getting shut down. You can get them more fed in the process as well.\n\n\n---\n\n\nI hope that this advice helps and if there is any way I can help or any questions in specific I can answer let me know! Good luck in your games!\n\n\n~Elam","replies":[]},{"poster":"Spiritofryu","date":"2017-01-05T08:51:57.150+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Depending on what lane you play, your best bet is to roam. I know, that when i win lane hard, but lose, its usually due to me not roaming (sometimes i get lazy) and the enemy jungler just camps my bot or top lane. Help out the lane thats slightly behind (in a match up thats not un-winnable) or the lane thats getting dumpstered., My advice for mid at least. \n\nFor support, ward, Play champs like Janna, Karma, Thresh, And nami, i find them to be amazing atm, Basically any champ that can keep your adc, or mid lane alive, whilst setting up ganks for the jungler, will help you snowball your lane, and if not snowball, keep alive, go even, etc etc. A good support is what makes an ADC.\n\nTop: just play Poppy, i mean seriously. your standard build gets you upwards 450 armor, around 200 mr, you do %hp damage (14% at max level i believe) on a spammable ability, and it hits twice. and if not Poppy, play Maokai.\n\nIt's just about learning the game, especially at bronze, i was Bronze years ago, would get to bronze 1 then tilt into bronze 3, i dont really tilt anymore,  and i can easily get out of bronze and silver, now. My main problem is, ive started playing more dota 2, and not enough League, so im falling behind (slightly). Knowledge, and decision making is what will win you games.","replies":[]}]}
