It sucks when something legitimately just goes wrong, but the door has to remain closed for abuse cases. \n\nYou had to reset your net and came back to win, so say you give a 5 minute AFK window where if you're gone for less than 5 minutes you're safe. A lot can happen in five minutes, so Jackass Joe who's mad at his team because he died is going to unplug his ethernet for just under 5 minutes to give the enemy a free siege. The enemy is kinda dumb though so they don't take it and Joe's team ends up winning. Does Joe deserve that win? Or should he be punished for leaving the game?\n\nIf you're not doing it intentionally, you'll earn that LP back in no time, and if the alternative is letting people ditch games for free then I'd say losing LP once or twice to net issues isn't really all that bad.","replies":[{"poster":"Ã–rnn Bot","date":"2018-01-31T17:16:48.386+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"riot wont update their punishment system to make it more fair they're just lazy so people that don't deserve punishments get them anyway other game companies don't have this issue","replies":[{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2018-02-01T03:16:50.333+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Ultimately an afk/dc has the same result, you have left the game. If it happens once or twice, so what? It sucks that you lose LP but you've still negatively affected your team, and it's barely a blip on the radar as far as LP is concerned. If it's happening all the time then it's on that player to sort out their internet issues before jumping into ranked and costing people games.","replies":[]}]}]}]}
