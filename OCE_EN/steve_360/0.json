It will be relevant as the other players would still be constantly going up.\n\n>2) I'll get into game and ill be at fountain and there will be 2 sometimes 3 of me (rengar) at base with everything in my base doubled up and when i move the base and fountain moves with me.\n\nThat just sounds trippy.\n\nWhat OS are you on, and who's your ISP? Did anything weird like this ever happen to you in the past? What graphics card do you use?","replies":[{"poster":"Steve 360","date":"2015-03-09T06:37:16.349+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"This update was to my operating system.\nI can't provide screenshots since i've only just got this computer and don't know how to screen shot.\nWindows 8 operating system and isp Iprimus and no I didn't have any problems with league until today when i had this game.\n\nI've tried to uninstall and re-install league and it does the same thing.\nSo I dont know whats going on.","replies":[{"poster":"HORSE OF FORCE","date":"2015-03-14T05:23:51.271+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Windows 8 has support for screen-shots via it's Snipping Tool. Open it up and select \"Rectangular\", with League running in Windowed mode. That should give you the least amount of problems.\n\nYou didn't mention what graphics card you're using, and that could very likely be causing these issues. Could you run dxdiag and provide the display information here?\n\nAlso, I'm still confused as to how your loaded percentage is going down. That is programmed to only go up.","replies":[]}]}]}]}
