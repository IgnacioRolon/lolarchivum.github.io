The honour system is not about that. Just because you received 75+ honours, doesn't mean anything if you have been reported for a tonne of negative behaviour. There's no fixed amount of honours you need to receive in order to go up a rank. The only intended way to rank up is to genuinely be a good person in the game - not about points, not about score but just about being a sportsmanlike person all the time.\n\n> no idea what that is about I usually stay positive though am a heavy supporter of 3/1 is agree to ff\n\nIn terms of your chat restriction, did you receive chatlogs regarding which games you were punished for? If you did, you could share it in the thread and we can go through why the exhibited behaviour was considered negative. If it's something you don't want to share publically, that's totally cool - but that should give you some sort of answer right there.\n\n\n\n> I'm at level one should I just throw out all that bs and go full rage at the assholes who are ruining the game (lane stealers, feeders, and idiots) because I'm otherwise fully stuffed for honor now anyways right ? or is there a realistic way with limited play time to get the level up\n\nConsistent and regular positive behaviour is the only way to bring your honour level back up. Don't focus on trying to level up honour so much - if you have sportsmanlike behaviour, your honour will naturally fix itself up.","replies":[{"poster":"jigglejigglwoosh","date":"2017-07-12T02:58:01.860+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"where can I check the chat log \nassuming negative chat is why I got  \nalso the crutch of this post is - is this gonna take forever after so long not doing anything wrong to not level up then this happens, its doesn't seem worth the effort to not be toxic","replies":[{"poster":"Project Xayah","date":"2017-07-12T03:06:04.573+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You should have received an email with the chat logs, and there should also be chat logs in the client pop-up if I remember correctly.
