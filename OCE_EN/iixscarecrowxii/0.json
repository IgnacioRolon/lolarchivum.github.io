His counter tips say  &quot;items that counter health stacking, such as Deathfire Grasp. Now; we all know that you guys removed the item from the game (RIP DFG) so for clarity purposes i was just wonder if you guys could possibly touch up on it before next patch. other than that keep up the good work :)","replies":[{"poster":"Blumpkin","date":"2015-05-28T09:25:15.129+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"lol riot needs a fucking fix up ahahaha. my shit is a better game then this lol","replies":[]},{"poster":"ShuffledPancake","date":"2015-05-27T08:00:15.382+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"To ez","replies":[]}]}
