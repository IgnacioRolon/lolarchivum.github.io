At least, these statistics are important to me, as gold earned + damage dealt to champions can quickly indicate a person not doing what they can with the resources they have.\r\n\r\nHowever, for supports, there has NEVER been a statistic beyond - healing done - to get a reading on how much they helped!\r\nThis doesn&#039;t just go for supports, even a tank like rammus should see something more than &quot;oh look I took 50,000 damage I did good&quot;.\r\nWe need some stats showing;\r\nCC landed\r\nDamage prevented/shielded\r\nLives saved\r\nand other utility based statistics for the ones left behind!\r\n\r\nHurry UUUUUUP riot I&#039;m not even a support main and I think it&#039;s lame to not have real satisfaction for these types of champions!","replies":[]}
