There's only a few **Rioters** on the boards, and many of them aren't qualified to punish in-game scripts and bots.\n\nYou're much better off sending in a [player support ticket](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/requests/new) directly to **Riot**. Your report will be get forwarded to specialists there who'll review the case.\n\nI've also edited out the names because of our \"[no naming and shaming](http://boards.oce.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/announcements/BjArMH2B-boards-universal-rules)\" rule.

Reporting bots to Riot CS doesn't work. I did that with over 40 bots in a ticket to them, included my match history and links to theirs too for each game. Was told that 'appropriate actions would be taken' thought of course Riot can't disclose any disciplinary actions blah blah... \nA few months later, and knowing Riot bans bots/scripters in waves, and after not seeing a decrease in botters, I did a manual check of every bloody bot I had reported by copying and pasting their names into my league client and searching for them there. And they were all still searchable, meaning the accounts were still active. Most had leveled to 30, most were now playing ranked (badly) and most of the people who bought these accounts hadn't even bothered doing a name change from the name the botters used. \nI ended up reaching out to a Rioter personally (via FaceBook) and spent hours and hours adding names, dates and data to a google doc he set up for me. Every time I had bots in my games I would add them to the doc. Problem sorted. TBH it was friggen exhausting but worth it.","replies":[{"poster":"Tele","date":"2016-10-02T04:15:50.415+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Assuming they were clearly bot accounts, that would be the fault of the player support \"specialist\" you talked to. \n\nReporting bots through **Riot** support definitely works, but on occasion you might get a rookie or someone who just doesn't care. When this happens it's best to follow up on **Riot** support and ask why nothing happened.\n\nI remember once asking **Riot** support for all IPs that logged into my account and being told it wasn't possible. Only to find out 3 months later that it actually was... -_-\n\nI'm glad you got it sorted out in the end though :D","replies":[{"poster":"WeaponizedAutizm","date":"2016-10-03T00:32:09.315+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"While I was initially talking to a generic staffer, my ticket was transferred to a 'Player Behaviour Specialist' whom I had quite a lot of interactions with.  \n\nAnd yeah, they were bot accounts. Zero doubt about that. There are so many flags that indicates to an account being part of a mass bot program; the name, the summoner spells used, behaviour in game, first buys, item builds, their reactions to taking damage. The clincher though was that they never joined the postgame lobby, ever. Their names simply never showed up as 'xFioraMaster18x joined the room\" or xFioraMaster18x left the room'. \n\nThere were so many of these bots showing up in ARAM pre-lvl30 games. And most of the actual players in the games had zero interest at all in reporting them because 'they make it easier to win huehuehue' (if they are enemy side). It was only when a player was out numbered by bots on their own team did they get upset and want them all reported. So rather than just simply reporting them via post game lobby, I started documenting them and reporting directly to Riot CS as well. \n\nI had games where I was the only player in the entire game, the other 9 were all bots. It's incredibly weird to be playing a 'social' team based game and be the only live human onboard. One of the most memorable was a 2v1 (me as Veigar who I never play and don't know how to, and someone else I can't remember on my team (maybe an Alistar?) vs a Xin or J4. After buying starting items I consisting of a tear, 4 Faire Charms and some HP pots (because, mana! you're useless if you're oom!) I didn't buy anything else until I had farmed 200 bonus AP - which isn't hard when there's 4 bots enemy side. Xin/J4 was oneshotting me up until that point but once I got the 200AP, the next time I died I had about 18k gold to spend and I promptly bought a Rabadons, Void Staff, Archangels (tear was a starting item so was pretty much stacked) and some other stuff I can't remember. But I do remember suddenly having about 1200AP and seeking out Xin/J4 and splatting him like a bug :D I honoured him after as the chat in game had been hilarious, and reported all the bots. \n\nThis was about a year ago now and, while the flags and markers that indicate an account is being run as part of a mass botting scheme may have changed since then, there was no doubt in my mind at all these were bots. I will stand by that assertion til my dying breath.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"moyixi","date":"2016-09-09T07:42:56.154+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Btw. if it is true, then im pretty sure they are not the only people who do this.
