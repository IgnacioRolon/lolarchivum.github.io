In this game I went 2/0/14 with 45 farm as a support to Kalista. The game lasted a total of 36:44 minutes and it ended in the other team surrendering. So I was felt like it was a game deserving of an S rank or at least S- rank and was excited to start my collection of level 6 tokens, and yet as a support going 2/0/14 is only worth an A in a game where the enemy team surrendered. Does that seem right?","replies":[{"poster":"DawgnTheBoys","date":"2016-11-09T00:06:19.412+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"You get a S based on how much gold you have per minute.
