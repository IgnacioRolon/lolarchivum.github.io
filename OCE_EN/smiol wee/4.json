However what I was wondering is why when they have an entire game mode that is dedicated to the projects which could break this constant monotonous grind up a little bit, yet it doesnt get used? Is there a reason for this or do they just not care enough anymore because they can break the bank on selling chroma bundles and jackpot orbs?","replies":[{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2019-08-02T13:37:27.089+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I would say it's likely because of the upkeep. Every patch that goes by a new thing in that game mode isn't going to be playing nice, and there's been a lot of patches since we last saw it. To be honest, I wouldn't be surprised if the effort to make that game-mode functional again was on par with building a new purpose-built one, and all for temporary content.\n\nI can't profess to know the details but as I understand it this was a large part of why they moved away from the RGM, and more towards more permanent options (or at least attempts at) like Nexus Blitz and TFT. It's a much more sound investment, both for the players and for Riot.\n\nDon't get me wrong, I miss some of the game-modes, and I do hope they come back in some form from time to time, but I also understand that logistically such things are difficult to support and prioritise.\n\nIf you want a more in-depth answer than that, I'd probably recommend posting over on NA since those are the folks that do all such dev work.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Lord Sesshomaru","date":"2019-08-02T12:44:19.578+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yeah, the game mode was actually really fun.\n\nIf you're going to disrespect us enough to give us back to back grinds, why not at least offer us interesting ways of earning tokens? _(seeming we cant play TFT either if we want to complete the missions)._","replies":[]}]}
