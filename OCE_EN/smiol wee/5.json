Let me clarify this is in a normal game, but I avoid ranked for such reasons.  I just figured it was just bad games, whatever keep on keeping on. However, I just finished a game such as this and figured &quot;why don&#039;t I just look at my team-mates&quot;. We had one lvl26, and three of them highest champion level was only partially lvl4. Now I&#039;m ranked at bronze 3 mind you. One of the enemy team members was gold 5, then as a team the average of them was either two lvl7&#039;s and a lvl6 or two lvl6 and either  a 7or5. I understand that judging by champ levels isn&#039;t the best means of judgement, however between 3 of my teammates combined their mastery score equalled out to 86 (that&#039;s two 9&#039;s and one 68), and my score alone is 209. If one could correct me if I&#039;m wrong, but I feel like matchmaking is having a laugh at me at my expense.\r\n\r\nAlso to clarify I&#039;ve been playing for around 5ish years (off and on for a bit of it).","replies":[{"poster":"SleazzyJefff","date":"2017-07-02T22:27:32.154+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"One important and most prominent rule of matchmaking in Normals is THERE IS NO MATCH MAKING IN NORMALS. \n\nYou could have 3 bronzes and they have 1 diamond and 1 plat for the simple fact that normals don't use a matchmaking algorithm. \n\nP.S Champ Levels don't mean shit. I have level 7 champs I suck with and eventually ditched cause I played them enough to get level 7 and still weren't good with them, e.g, my trash Riven (still flash that lvl 7 icon hoping to intimidate).","replies":[]},{"poster":"xXTechMasterXx","date":"2017-07-01T20:59:44.376+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Right now the systems for matchmaking are definitely not the best, but i doubt Riot can change that anytime soon. It would take a lot of time and effort to change the way the system works and who knows they could even being doing that at this moment. In my opinion it would be best to include things like how often the person is reported, their champ mastery score(not as much some people are one tricks), definitely their rank and mmr and maybe a new feature that grades them on their communication and what words they use in chat. This could be like a score where each word gives certain points and some give negative points. Doesn't everyone just hate those flamers who somehow ranked the same as you but push you even lower?","replies":[]}]}
