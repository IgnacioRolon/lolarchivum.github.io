Now the same thing has happened with Project Jinx. I bought the Skin/Icon combo (300 tokens) and I have the icon (which is a black circle when I try use it) and the Project Jinx Chroma is not showing up in my list of skins.\n\nSo I'm now down Vice Garen and Project Jinx chroma skins... :(\nI'll do a ticket, just not sure which ticket to lodge it as.\n---\n\n[EDIT]\nIgnore previous, after some googling and some searching, I found a separate area in \"My Collection\" where the Event Chroma's are tucked away. They don't show up in the Skins section, they are in a different area listed as \"Chromas\" and are not counted as 'acquired skins'\n\nMy ignorance strikes again.","replies":[{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2019-09-04T13:37:05.416+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Chromas (which are what you can purchase for 300 tokens) and skins aren't the same.\n\nSkins are alternate looks for the champion (so they require the champion to use). Chromas are an alternate colour palette for skins (so they require the skin to use).\n\nThe only skins you can buy for tokens are the Prestige Edition skins. They are similar to chromas, but they go beyond simple colour changes (they also change models and particles/VFX), so they are their own entity.\n\nAs for the icons not working, it can take them a sec to refresh, but if they don't work after some time or a client restart, it's possible you had a bad patch and your client is missing some assets. If that's the case you should run a client repair.","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2019-08-02T13:38:46.661+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"How odd.
