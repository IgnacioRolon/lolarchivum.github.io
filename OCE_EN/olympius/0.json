Updating some dll files from my friends computer where it works.\n\nThat's ill-advised. Yes, it's tempting to just *put* the files where they belong, but that bypasses editing the registry, so even though you have the file, you don't have access to it. Also, it's not the correct author and the file doesn't have right permissions/associations.\n\nYou've done a reinstall, during which it would install DirectX for you. If you had any problems with DirectX, it would have happened then. Strange that it didn't.\n\nWhat graphics card do you have?","replies":[]}]}
