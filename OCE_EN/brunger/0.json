Most recently when I completed the missions I went to select a champion I was unable to, I can place my cursor over a champion and the 'select' button will appear however when I attempt to hover over the button, it vanishes. Every time now when I attempt to restart my game and login using my account this screen is all that appears.","replies":[{"poster":"Squijy","date":"2019-12-25T15:06:35.352+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"This helped me pass through the glitch in most of my accounts, but not 100 percent sure if it works every time. Once you get to the screen glitch hover over the spot which pops up the character selection and ability list; once it pops up stay on it so the selection stays and just start pressing the 'esc' button. I tend to just press it as much as I can and It should bring you back to the lobby. Hopefully this works for you guys as well.","replies":[{"poster":"hitmanmanman","date":"2019-12-28T15:02:02.522+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"ty soo much!!!","replies":[]},{"poster":"GreyManic","date":"2019-12-27T14:03:20.624+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"This worked great cheers mate!","replies":[]},{"poster":"GlassManson","date":"2020-01-02T00:12:17.623+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Much Love.
