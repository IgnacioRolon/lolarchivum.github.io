There are plenty of people who even in ranked are glory hounds who play for the KDA and calling anything is taken as some sort of slight on their intelligence or authoritative rather than purely information.\n\nAnd I find teams are rarely balanced. Sure the idea is right on paper, but usually it's a completely slam dunk in one direction or the other in the first 5-10 minutes due to 1 guy who is tilt from the beginning and feeds his lane. Or worse yet, some guy who's tilt ends up tilting the guy on your team that is your only hope of winning due to him winning lane really well and they afk or abuse the guy who fed.\n\nSometimes it happens the other direction, but that's kinda the problem, it really is a random shooting gallery of chance, you either get teamed with that 1 extra person who bleeds tears from all his fingers when people ask him to do something, or the enemy team does, and that's all it takes for a slam dunk to happen.\n\nI've been in so many games where i've carried hard, broken 6 turrets, ganked lanes, team is something like 40/15, and somehow, my teammates have NO idea how to press the advantage, and hang back at towers, let the enemy cs multiple waves of creeps with zero resistance or pressure, and in the end, end up winning the game due to a late game comp/better teamwork. \nYou might say \"that's good, they had better teamwork so they deserve to advance\", really? so the guy who single handedly or the 2 people who really pulled their fingers out and gave their team the chance to win in the first 15 minutes are somehow less worthy of advancing despite their stellar early game teamwork, objective focus and otherwise?\n\nI agree that 1 player does not make enough of a difference, you need to be lucky enough to get that 1 or 2 extra people on your team that want to try, and do. Otherwise I don't even think a Korean challenger could carry themselves out of bronze at any better rate than your average player on bronze OCE.\n\nThe reality I find is, just play solo, get good at Jungle so you can support whatever lane is winning, push that lane right in early, force the other lanes to split and allow the other lanes on your team to farm (whether they lost lane or not, they will gain/regain their lost advantage). Or similarly a mid lane roamer who can push other lanes as well.\nIt's hard to carry as a top laner unless you get insanely fed (well, generic tanky top laner, you can pull it off as Quinn or similar, but you aren't tanky enough and often enough top is the only tanky champ in low elo).\n\nI suppose you could take the same philosophy as supp, do your best to get your adc kills and push lane, and otherwise help mid and try to press a bigger advantage and ward up drag/their jungle so your jungler can see when theirs is there/low hp/not in their top, etc..\nBut I find it a lot harder to make big impact plays as a supp in that situation, especially if top is the one who is winning and your lanes despite all your effort are just feeding or whatever.\nlate game impact you're obviously going to be more valuable as supp, especially Thresh, but most games are won/lost in 5-10 minutes in low elo, people give up and cry themselves into a losing mindset by then. Early tower downs really hurt bronze morale, thus why I prefer jungle to carry myself out of things.\n\n\nIronically enough this season (I started on NA, xfered recently), I went 8/2 in my promos, I was S4 last season (my first season, I was green as hell at the start and destroyed my MMR early on, only gave it a quick go at the end of the season and got to S4), those 8 wins were 50% domination, by me as jungler (shyv, entirely), 50% also surrenders by them, all B2-S4 players, and the system placed me in Bronze 3, go figure right?\nGot myself to Silver 5 before I xfered about a week ago, and did my single placement match on OCE, guess where it put me? you may have guessed it! Bronze 3 =D, yay.\n\n</novel>","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Focus On End","date":"2015-06-10T10:55:21.818+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":3,"body":"i am diamond v rito employee and i think i know what can reach challenger","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"proMINscuous","date":"2015-06-09T10:42:39.202+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Well having an adc as your duo would help :P","replies":[{"poster":"iEpTo","date":"2015-06-09T10:48:20.393+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Well, my mate doesn't want to duo with me since \"Im a shitty bronzie\" and i cant really find anyone to duo with:/","replies":[{"poster":"kJs","date":"2015-06-09T15:33:17.316+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"when you find a good friendly adc, tell him you want to duo with him","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"McRuthless","date":"2015-06-09T21:31:25.921+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"Honestly, support is one of the easier roles to carry from if you know what you're doing. 90% of the time the enemy bot lane (the support especially) will only be playing that role because they were last pick and will have no idea what they're doing, so it's incredibly easy to win lane even if your ADC is useless. The bot lane with the better support almost always wins lane, especially if you are significantly better than your opponent. Its also a morale thing, think of how many times you've seen \"gg noob bot lane\" or similar. This can be the enemy team in nearly every game. A support carries in the laning phase and in the mid game with vision and roaming, by then you can have a big lead for your team and be heavily favoured to win.\n\nOther tips i would give to make carrying easier:\n\n-Once you win lane (which you should do 90% of the time, since the enemy bot lane will usually suck), translate this into an advantage for the rest of your team. You DO NOT need to follow the ADC around all game, especially since they will often have no idea where they need to be on the map. Around the time you hit level 6 (sometimes even before) you should be looking for opportunities to roam. Good times for this are when you push up to enemy turret or your ADC goes back to base. Also look to get wards in the bot side of the enemy jungle to open up opportunities to gank their jungler. If you get a kill or force bot lane to back, or get a kill while roaming mid, get dragon if your jungler is in the area and your not too low. This may require several pings before your team will cooperate. Once it gets to mid game, you should rarely be in bot lane anymore.\n\n-If you lose lane, roam. Staying in lane doing nothing and/or dying will not get your team an advantage. Go gank mid or top to try get yourself back into the game and give your team an advantage. Return to lane in time to prevent your ADC getting tower dived if possible. \n\n-Try to assess the relative power/skill of the other people as the game progresses. You should be trying to work with and protect the teammates that have the highest chance of carrying the game. If your ADC sucks, theres no point peeling for him when you could be protecting your 5-0 mid laner instead. Similarly, try to see which enemies are most likely to carry the game and use you cc effectively to stop them killing your whole team.\n\n-Buy pink wards constantly and upgrade your sweeper as soon as you get level 9. People in bronze facecheck bushes constantly and you can snowball super hard in the mid game by clearing wards and catching people. Once you have an advatage look to keep at least one side of their jungle warded up and clear any wards you see them place in this area for easy catches.\n\n-Stop playing thresh. However good you might think you are, I can basically guarantee you could do better with a less complicated champion. Thresh isn't just about landing hooks, there are a lot more things to factor into your decision making than with a more simple support. He also requires a greater degree of competence from your teammates (clicking lanterns, providing damage on the people you cc) which you cannot expect in bronze. AP supports with cc and  burst are the best in my experience, because its easy to catch people out and get kills with little to no help from your team and you can snowball easily by yourself. Stuff like Annie, Morgana, Brand. Tankier supports like Blitzcrank or Leona are somewhat less effective but also good.\n\n-Take ignite instead of exhaust. This will make it easier to punish people for mistakes in lane and snowball a lead. Also helps to secure kills mid game while ganking or if you catch low health enemies. The only time i would recommend taking exhaust is if they have multiple late game exhaust targets (assassins, high dps bruisers) that your teamcomp cannot otherwise deal with.","replies":[{"poster":"TheSingularity","date":"2015-06-10T06:43:40.420+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"He pretty much summed it up.\nYes thresh can make fancy plays but as ^above^ said, he's far more team reliant and his CC ain't as hard as other supports.\nHis AP support recommendations are accurate but I'd personally add zyra, lux and lissandra into the mix. They're much less supporty but if your on a loosing streak and wanna enter super ultra try hard mode, these may do it for ya. As for tanks, nautilus has re-entered the scene(which is highly unfortunate as I'm no longer the one playing the rarely seen champ) and braum are extremely powerful peel supports if that's what your team needs.\n\nTo add, I find that support, mid and jungle. Have the greatest influence on your teams actions. Learn how and when to call the shots like when to group, take dragons, baron ect. This skill alone(well and basic aim, wards ect) carried me and naut(jg) out of bronze as I ruled my teams with an iron fist! You don't listen to me, guess what? my team goes off at you, whole team don't listen to me? then ah well sh*t happens. Be assertive. But don't be a total pain in the ass. Nagging the jungle or mid who are just warding to be safe, to htfu will only aggravate the situation. Not only can you make yourself the czar and tell people when and what the team should be doing, but also control conflict. Not many do it but calming the mid laner who just died due to a countergank(now blaming and BMing jungler) down, instead of letting his keyboard run wild can really help the team. As this makes the player under attack feel better that someone has his back, puts the twat in his place and the rest of the team usually goes(literally had someone say this 2 days ago) \"thanks heavens we have someone with some sense of maturity\" and in that game my team continued to listen and we continued onto victory.\n\nGl with your support main endeavours bra.
