Did you allow the game to patch completely, or did you stop the patch mid-way through, possibly multiple times?\n\nThe current size for my League of Legends directory is **6.28 GB**.","replies":[{"poster":"Kenpachizero","date":"2016-03-12T08:20:23.220+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"i did let it download fully without stopping, i just re-checked now and it is at 5.19GB which sounds better, with this is am going to assume that the reboot removed the temp files, as when i finished downloading the game i launched it straight away and logged in and the temp files was still there.\n\nwith pando,i did download it from [here](https://onedrive.live.com/redir?resid=5F2FF99137250CD8!6414&authkey=!AMO_lvFAu14Ef1k&v=3&ithint=photo%2cJPG), maybe a isp or someone between me and riot has a old cached version, [here](https://onedrive.live.com/redir?resid=5F2FF99137250CD8!6415&authkey=!AAnZZSERm3cKees&v=3&ithint=photo%2cJPG) is my system restore points showing pando was installed","replies":[]}]}]}
