I went and checked but I noticed that my other emotes have disappeared except for my &quot;d&#039;pengu&quot; and &quot;excited kitty&quot; emotes. I have already written up a bug report to Riot Games but idk how this has happened. I don&#039;t know if this has happened to anyone else but I would like this problem to be resolved as quickly as possible.\n\n(Up top is a screenshot of my emotes before receiving the \"excited kitty\" emote) \nI just realized that I don't even have the default thumbs up emote XDDD\n\nSo I went to confirm this to my friend, they say that some of their emotes (most notably their \"thumbs up\" emote which I find funny) are missing as well. I think that the emotes that are missing are emotes you normally can't get such as legacy emotes. I have checked how many emotes there are previously, which says on the screenshot 9/60 emotes required for me, but now it says 2/51 emotes required (since I just got my new emote). The emotes that I only see in the emotes required are the ones you can only get in the store and nowhere else.","replies":[{"poster":"Lord Pasta Scoop","date":"2018-08-01T12:35:41.180+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Don't worry, half of my emotes have disappeared as well.
