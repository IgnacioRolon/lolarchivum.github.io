How about self summoned allies, such as Tibbers, Yoricks ghouls, Malz&#039;s voidlings? I&#039;m just a bit unsure of what the term &#039;allies&#039; means xD\r\n\r\nThanks for any help people could provide me with &lt;3","replies":[{"poster":"Crunch","date":"2016-02-29T04:41:06.187+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"This is a great question, as if it was allied minions it would really make minion manipulation/trading in lane very interesting.
