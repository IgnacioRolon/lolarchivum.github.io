As BarryButcher mentioned there is a 0 tolerance policy for behaviours like suicide encouragement. It was the \"kys\" comments that escalated you to a 14 day ban, even if you haven't had any previous punishments. You are not responsible for the behaviour of other players, only your own.","replies":[]},{"poster":"CocaCola Zer0","date":"2018-09-05T21:20:41.304+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":2,"body":"Haha dw man this is riot i git perma banned for saying please report my inting jungler you just kinda get used to it. Then when you ask them about unbanning they say just make a new acc i spent 3.5k on this acc and now i gotta start again. I recommend muting everyone man because the next thing you get will be a perma ban my dude on my new acc i haventbeen reported once just mute everyone at the start of the game it also helps you to focus on your gameplay and not worry about typing. Thats just my recommendation bro but yeah.","replies":[{"poster":"BlobMarl3y","date":"2018-09-07T01:05:11.590+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"regularly used to get the same and still do, there's a bunch of silly apes online now days that are vying for superiority, but i don't agree with muting all players, its a team game, there should be incentives for playing it that way and there should be more sportsmanlike play. less of this consistent selfish blather. IF YOUR IN PVP, NOT PLAYING 1v1, then you need to acknowledge and work with your team. simply because someone has not got a mic does not make them more or less valid. also somehow a big issue.... people assume since you cant mic chat your a pleb. were not all rich but some have more than 2 braincells.","replies":[{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2018-09-07T09:38:00.712+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"The mute everyone at the start of game recommendation is really only for those people who fall very easily into negativity. If you're going to be tilted horizontal from one question mark ping, it's worth the mute. If you can brush off the initial toxicity/bad play/disagreement etc then it's better just to mute those single players when they pop up.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2018-09-06T04:22:22.400+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":1,"body":"You wouldn't have been banned for just asking for reports.
