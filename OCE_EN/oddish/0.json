I've tried turning on/off my firewall and checking the \"inbound rules\" log and realizing that \"League of Legends\" isn't even there.. \r\nThis usually fixes itself in time and only time but never the same time. Once it lasted 3 days and once just a game. I've tried re-installing everything and nothing has worked to fix it and it's getting really frustrating. Any help OCE?","replies":[{"poster":"HORSE OF FORCE","date":"2015-02-06T08:50:17.982+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Have you checked out [this thread](http://boards.oce.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/help-support-oce/WlGElu7g-update-firewall-error-after-champion-select) yet?","replies":[]}]}
