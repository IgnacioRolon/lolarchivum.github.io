Mine still isn't connecting so I'm confused about what it might be because I'm on flip and I'm not sure why not ALL of them would've been fixed if it was a problem with the ISP. \r\n2. After reading the forums I read that other people who were on different ISP's (eg. Flip, Spark, Slingshot etc) were having the same issue, so was it only Flip that had the issue or are all of them having some problems?  \r\n3. I've realised so far that I can't play at any time during the day before 9:30pm (NZ time) and I'm not sure till what time I can play till. \r\n\r\nThis is getting really tiring and throwing me off playing LoL at all and I really don't want to abandon this game, I've spent a fair bit of money and time playing and I don't regret it but any other people feeling me? \r\n\r\nRiot pls send help\r\n-Oddish","replies":[{"poster":"HORSE OF FORCE","date":"2015-02-13T05:07:25.321+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":">I'm not sure why not ALL of them would've been fixed if it was a problem with the ISP.\n\nGood point.

I wanted to say thank you for reaching out to us and emailing our team to further investigate. You did help us find a config setting that we have since addressed, and made it better for all Flip players. Thanks mate and good luck on the rift.","replies":[]}]}
