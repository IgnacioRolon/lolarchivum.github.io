Me being salty I walk off to the bathroom and chill there for a few seconds. When I return to my computer, in the chat is a message from the league client to all players saying something like\r\n\r\n&quot;You have 60 seconds left to /remake due to player DC&quot; something like that I can&#039;t remember too well lol!\r\n\r\nEven though no one in the game DCed not to mention our TF died prior to the /remake message. Me being worried that we would lose I /remake coz you know I ain&#039;t risking a match with a TF that dies to mid Lulu in the first 2.5 minutes.\r\n\r\nso TL:DR  --- Could /remake despite no DC&#039;s and even a death before /remake message.\r\n\r\nhere is screenshot of prove and I hope riot sees this and fixes as it is quite gamebreaking \r\nhttp://i.imgur.com/MYj727j.jpg\r\nhttp://i.imgur.com/MYj727j.jpg","replies":[{"poster":"Biggest Gimp OCE","date":"2016-07-11T13:23:06.688+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"i think gp went afk, look at his cs","replies":[]},{"poster":"Attysu The Poro","date":"2016-07-13T00:50:06.486+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Was GP AFK?","replies":[]},{"poster":"Aidan7787","date":"2016-07-11T10:37:17.338+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"I believe they got rid of the first blood thing, cause i was watching bjergsen when they realised the other team would remake they 5 man dive bot turret for a kill but that didnt stop it.
