However many times I find myself making a gamechanging misplay due to a prioritation of the selfquickcast. \r\n\r\nIt goes like this, I am about to die as janna so I run away and self cast shield on my self by pressing &#039;alt-e&#039;. However, as I am running away my mouse is randomly aiming on the tower or my fellow ezreal and because of the prioritation, although I self cast, the shield goes to ezreal. And I die\r\n\r\nI just think this is a problem because I think if someone is pressing &#039;alt&#039; as default selfcast then the prioritation should be that its a &quot;self&quot; cast and not a self cast onto a turret/teamate due to the fact that their mouse just happened to accidently be hovering over their friendly model","replies":[{"poster":"Slink","date":"2018-11-26T02:09:11.975+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Bump. Still something worth changing, if I'm holding the modifier I want to cast on myself, it shouldn't matter where my mouse is.\nIf I want to cast at a target I **won't hold** the modifier, who in their right mind holds the self cast modifier when wanting to cast at another target!?\n\nDamn the amount of times I've cast my ult on someone else instead of myself as Liss in aram because the 5 melee enemy team is on top of me, simply because of this one stupid priority non-decision.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Nightjar","date":"2017-06-07T11:22:27.231+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"if you are running away, you should probably have the mouse pointer close to your champion to improve your ability to rapidly change direction and dodge, but yeah that issue should probably be fixed,","replies":[]},{"poster":"Aqua","date":"2017-06-07T08:32:38.280+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"bump sorry i just still think this is something worth looking into","replies":[]}]}
