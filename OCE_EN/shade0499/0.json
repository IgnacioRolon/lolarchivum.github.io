I'm stuck in Bronze at the moment. Was playing at Silver 2 last season, but then got banned, and had to restart again. I'm Bronze 2 for now, but I'm struggling extremely hard, as I main support, and the times you can 'carry' a game as support are very few. You pretty much have to rely on your team, and if you get paired with an adc who can't CS or control a lane, then your options are very limited.\n\nThat said, here's some advice I could give from experience and from others.\n\n1) Learn to carry. Kinda ironic coming from a support main, but try to main roles that can carry. Hyper carry adcs. Nasus top. Shaco jungle. There are tonnes of very strong champs out there that you can pick and carry with. If I didn't enjoy support so much - and the knowledge that I'm filling a role very few players actually want to do - I would be playing Jinx adc all day!\n\n2) Make smart decisions. Don't overstay. Don't run through jungle solo in unwarded territory. Don't engage in stupid team fights. If a champion is clearly dead, cut your losses. The only thing worse than a stupid death, is two stupid deaths. Watch the pros play and you can see the patience they have. If your gut is telling you 'No!', then listen. There's a chance that you could make an awesome spectacular chance kill! There's also a more likely chance you'll die. If you coll your jets, the worst that will happen is that you've put pressure on and they have to recall and you live to push another objective.\n\n3) Don't flame. Nuff said. Mute players. Don't blame. Flame = lose game.\n\n4) Duo with another good player. As a support main, if I support an incredible ADC, you bet I'm adding them and duo'ing with them all day. Don't get a noob real-life friend and duo just because they're on voice comms etc. Get an *actual* good player and rank up with them. Adc/support or top/jungle or mid/jungle are great duos.\n\n5) Focus objectives. I played one game where this Rengar was thrashing me in top lane. I played passive and he had loads of farm and kills. He drifted off mid and bot and started roaming, engaging in team fights. I kept in lane and pushed lane all the way through to inhib. We won the game despite him being fed, because towers win matches, not kills. I was able to take enough objectives to draw their team top again and then we got drag, and more towers and baron. Bronze players don't focus the objectives. Use this to your advantage. If you see their jungle is bot, push tower. If they are going drag, get rift herald. Lanes pushed? Get another lane where they aren't.\n\n6) Learn to CS and control a lane. If you don't know how to 'Freeze' a lane, then learn it. Kills get you some gold, but a wave of minions will net you just as much. CS is all important. You need to be aware of your map and lane, and know when to push it to tower, and when to freeze it. This will help with ganks, avoiding ganks, and taking objectives.\n\n7) Learn to work in Champion Select. A game can actually be lost in champ select. If you have loads of assassins, but they're a team of sustain tanks, then you're gonna have a tough time. If you have no ad or no ap, you're gonna have a tough time. If you have no initiation, and they have loads of disengage, you're gonna have a hard time! Communicate with your team, and pick a champ that suits the team's need, not which one you're best with. On this note, it is best to learn a variety of champs in each role. I'd say at least 3 varied champs. One will probably be banned, one might not work with/against their/your team… three is a good base so you have options no matter the bans and team compositions.\n\n8) WARD! I am still astounded by how little players ward. Ward more.\n\nAnd that's all I can think of for now. It's a good start.","replies":[{"poster":"JakeDaum","date":"2016-05-04T05:11:00.889+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"#3 is fire","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"RonyStark","date":"2016-05-03T13:06:22.235+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Never Ever Ever play support in bronze elo\nNEVER!\n\nGo carry.

Not only is it hardest to carry as support, but its honestly a rather lazy role if you're not a really good higher elo support, which if you were you'd climb by now. Try picking jungle and getting good at ganking, its a similar 'support your team' role, but you have far more carry power.
