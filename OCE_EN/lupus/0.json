I&#039;m pretty bummed. AP champs that I like to play are typically tankier and use spellvamp to sustain. You seem to be absolutely ruining this. And so, you&#039;re going to ruin my gaming experience.\r\n\r\nSince I have no way of asking except over these forums:\r\n\r\n**Can I please get a refund of all the AP champs and Skins I have purchased with cash over the years?**\r\n\r\nI ask because you are fundamentally changing the game for the champs I like/want to play and I feel now that because of your choices in changing things, my gaming experience will be made drastically worse. I purchased the things I did out of enjoyment of the game, and they were in a state that I expected not to change. It is disturbing to me how much these changes are going to have an effect. I also have an account in North America, and one in the EU which I would also be looking for a reversal in these accounts as well (yup, I&#039;ve definitely spent some money with this company).","replies":[{"poster":"Ing√©nue","date":"2016-04-10T01:34:13.899+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Unfortunately you are not going to be able to be refunded for all of the mages and skins you own (AFAIK). The only way to refund is through your refund credits (which, if you have been playing for years are probably all used up). \n\nWhat don't you like about the mage update?","replies":[{"poster":"Lupus","date":"2016-04-10T01:47:18.242+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Actually, I think I've only ever used one refund. But I have all champs and loads of skins for said champs. Hence my Investment in this.\n\nI like to play tankier/bruiser mages such as Lissandra. I use spellvamp and items such as the RoA to become tanky. These items are either being deleted (Will of the Ancients) or are being nerfed (Rod of Ages). To be honest, it screws what I can do with these champs, especially when you try to be independent of your team (spellvamp vs pots). I don't want to play a burst mage with loads of item actives.\n\nI think what really puts a bee in my bonnet, is that Riot always preaches about \"enjoyment of the game\". I think they are seriously impinging on my enjoyment of this game, one that I have spent a good deal of money on.\n\nBtw, thanks for not being a child and discussing this, unlike others...","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Vanilla Bread","date":"2016-04-10T01:03:28.019+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"how bout no","replies":[]},{"poster":"Nijel","date":"2016-04-10T08:09:38.734+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I think you should take tentative changes with a grain salt and wait until you've tried them out before writing them off. If you've played for years you've already gone through this 100s of times. We all have. League is a process of adapting and sometimes the things we enjoy can come from the least likely of changes.","replies":[]}]}
