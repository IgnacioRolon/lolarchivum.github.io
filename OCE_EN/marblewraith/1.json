However i am quite a busy person (and im sure many of you also have commitments to meet) so i want to get all 3 ward skins within the next 3 - 4 days if possible.\r\n\r\n1. Can play all the time while ranked queues are up, including all the way through to 3 - 4am [AEST](http://www.timeanddate.com/time/zones/aest).\r\n2. Voice chat capable (curse, teamspeak), even if you have no mic and can only listen that&#039;s fine.\r\n3. Preferably not bronze in solo rank.\r\n\r\nFeel free to friend me in game.","replies":[]}
