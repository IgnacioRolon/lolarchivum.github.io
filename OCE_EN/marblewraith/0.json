You are making me scroll for ages before i can actually them, it&#039;d be even worse if i didnt have groups and just 1 ginormous list of friends.\r\n\r\nFurthermore why display people who are logged in on mobile at all? It&#039;s pointless.\r\n\r\nWhen im looking for someone to invite i wanna see who&#039;s logged into the actual game. Sure it&#039;s nice that you can msg them on their phones but that&#039;s a secondary concern.","replies":[]}
