I usually sit at around 86ms (located in Perth) however it is common for this to spike (predominantly in the evening however it can occur during the day also) anywhere from 200ms up-to and over 2000ms.\n\nMy ISP is TPG however I cannot see any contention within their network based on the ping and traceroutes I have completed to date, given that Riot appears to block the majority of IMCP traffic I am unable to confirm that the issue is 100% out of the TPG network. I have uploaded the results of the network diagnostic tool however is it possible for Riot to advise of an IP that will respond to IMCP traffic within your network so that I can test when the spikes are occuring?\n\n\nKind Regards,\n- J","replies":[{"poster":"HORSE OF FORCE","date":"2015-02-05T06:54:32.020+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey bass,\n\nFor something like that, you should write a ticket, not make a board post. If they tell you to make a board post, then it means that particular employee had no idea what you were talking about.\n\nHeads up, I doubt they'd tell you the IP.\n\nBest of luck, though!","replies":[]}]}
