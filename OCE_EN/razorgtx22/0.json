Why must we sit here with 3 afkers on team and twiddle our fingers waiting for 20 minutes to surrender when the game is clearly not winnable nor is a fun, esp when you tell the enemy team you got 3 afkers yet they wont push towers and win game quickly. Its just a waste of game time imo, when we could be already in queue and loading up for the next one.\r\n\r\nI cant see the big deal anyway with changing it ..atleast 80% community doesn't surrender...and that when by 20 minutes, they have lost every tower and the score is 2 kills/40 deaths by 20 minutes. Atleast a timer change will give the rest of us 20% abit more game time when you get that 2/3 man afk team..zzzz","replies":[{"poster":"SEKAI","date":"2015-02-04T14:23:34.591+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":1,"body":"If you play a game just to surrender when the condition is not favouring you then why bother play a match based game?

Yes I do believe the afk/verbal abuse/whatever SHOULD get harsher punishment than whatever we have now, however it doesn't change the fact 1 to 2 afk games is NOT a major thing to throw a fit over.\n\nThe surrender timer being set at 20 minute is there to prevent early surrender loser mentality during an even match, AFK is not of its concerns, call it intentional design overlook if you will as punishments are NOT meant to be handled by the surrender system.\n\nAs I said, we should get an improvement on our punishment system instead of moving the surrender timer forward.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Wiggy","date":"2015-02-04T17:37:46.890+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"you completely skimmed over his major point of 3 afkers and decided to arrogantly post a silly comment without putting any thought in to it.\n\nIn a 2v5, there is no fun, there is no hope, there is only slaughter.","replies":[{"poster":"SEKAI","date":"2015-02-05T02:15:37.633+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"You are the one who misses the point.\n\nSurrender vote has NOTHING to do with punishing/dealing with the afks in the first place.","replies":[{"poster":"Wiggy","date":"2015-02-05T10:53:56.959+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"firstly, i didn't say you missed the point, i said you skimmed over it, like most people do when they don't have a logical response, as you have again done with yet another comment.\n\nsecondly, his ENTIRE post wasn't about punishing/dealing with afkers, it was about not forcing people in those unfortunate situations to waste more time when there is literally no hope for a recovery in a lopsided match.\n\nplease at least attempt to read the post before commenting in future, kudos.","replies":[{"poster":"SEKAI","date":"2015-02-05T13:59:36.688+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I don't know about you, you like playing with words or something?

Riot is trying to point out that they expect most players to not afk in games as normally people should be playing for as long as defeat or victory appears at end screen. The games isn't about we should end the game faster so we can get into another game, it's about strategies in order to achieve victory as a team not: \"This game's pointless let's surrender so we can get into another one which we think will be able to win\" Wouldn't it be more fun to make a comeback rather than not trying at all even when things seem really pointless? Surrender times has nothing to do with 2v5 but rather the punishments for dcs/afks as Sekai was trying to point out to you. Maybe surrender time should -3 minutes for each afk so if it was 2v5 it would make 11 minutes the new surrender time.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Unseen Predator","date":"2015-02-05T12:06:16.735+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Generally good players will want to surrender and move onto the next one faster because the more games they get the faster they will climb, its mainly the morons that click \"No\" no matter the situation that's the problem, ok i get it you want to play on and see if you can win but any decent player knows when a game is over or not, do you know what they do in higher elo? They surrender to end the game so they can move onto the next game sooner, this means you don't waste time and you also climb faster, the more games you have the faster you climb.\n\nThis is something people need to learn, if you're a decent player then you will only climb and not drop, the more games you have the quicker you will climb, surrendering a lost game instead of wasting time makes you climb faster, this is why good players like to surrender, they KNOW its just wasting time.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Slim Chaedi","date":"2015-02-04T14:55:32.761+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I feel you on the AFKs.\nMaybe they could implement something so if you have 2 or more AFKs (for a set period so people can just leave right before the surrender to make it possible), you can surrender early.
