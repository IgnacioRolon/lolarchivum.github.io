Once it gets officially released there are definitely going to be people trolling and, once word gets out about the in-game levelling system, it's probably going to attract them like moths to a flame.

since.\n\ni have hearthstone, its pretty fun but I lost the energy to persist with it.\nI pretty much play hots, evolve, league (though less now), and if I could be bothered hearthstone.\n\nofc if I had day of defeat I would play that, I miss the community on there. \n\nhonoustly the main reason I like hots is because all of the players share the experience pool, and you start with all your abilities (part from your ultimate), this makes people not even care about who gets the kills or what items you buy (since theres no in game shop, it takes a bit to get used to)\n\nflame level: 0-5/100\nlol flame level: 78-93/100\n\nso yeah, I find it way more enjoyable just because of its more friendly community. not to say league is bad but its community and pressure can get a bit too much to bother with","replies":[{"poster":"Zero Infinity","date":"2015-03-05T23:23:23.597+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I think LOL has lost it's sense of community, but I believe it can get it

by tools you gain a perk or \"talent\" every few levels (4/7/10/13/16/20) that makes your abilities more potent or gives you access to other benefits. \nso in effect its got the same objective as items and builds but it's just laid out differently.\nso it's not really lacking like that it's just.. different. \n\nI thought that's what you meant by \"I just don't think there are enough tools out there to do so yet.\" , you could have been referring to building a community though lol, if so I think that the community kind-a dropped off when the lore dropped off. people don't think about anything related to league apart from in-game because there's no content to discuss until a juicy patch gets dropped in, and even then people just complain about it.\nmaybe if it had some community management staff or something to try and motivate people to get involved, but apart from that it seems pretty dead.\n\nalthough play with riot was great (Riot Jimz is my senpai) the game is lacking in background interest. now its just about technical decisions and it kind of rips a bit of the game away. just my opinion though.","replies":[{"poster":"Zero

conversations.\nI like the upvote/downvote for ordring.\nI like that toxic reports can be reported and are removed. \nLess circle jerking and attention seeking trolls as well.\n\nPeople are resistant to change, but overall I think boards allows potential for a happier community experience.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Zero
