Seriously I disconnected one game and League CONSTANTLY kept crashing making it impossible for me to get back into the game, Then I receive 5 10minute waits before I can join the queue. fair enough I was afk at the end of the game. BUT tonight I was playing fine, Had internet issues, league crashed and wouldn't load the pvp.kernal so I rebooted my pc logged in and continued the game, then I finished the game and now I have 5 20minute fucking bans. This is fucking bullshit, I can understand if I left many games and didnt come back but when you are gone for like 5minutes come back finish the game then get fucking banned anyway. How is this in any way fair.","replies":[{"poster":"HORSE OF FORCE","date":"2015-01-21T07:12:47.577+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Not everyone is getting this.","replies":[]},{"poster":"CoffeyFlavoured","date":"2015-01-21T04:11:39.162+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I just got this followed by a 5 game low priority ban when both options on my screen lead to this screen (Both lol Icons that is) Tried quiting and restarting and got the same thing. My ping in the game before was 30, this one 2500. And Everything else was working fine (Could load web pages instantly while this was happening so it wasn't my end). \nthis is crap and the auto banning system is incredibly stupid. For ranked games I'd understand if it was constant but this is an issue on there side and not mine. It's random, I can't find anything that seems to be causing it and its quite annoying to say the least.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Lavish brutality","date":"2015-01-20T12:33:44.891+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Got same issue here, I just got disconnected /pack lose during the game, my internet was fine , and i had stable 23 ping, I tried everything to reconnect, but nothing worked. then i got a leaverbuster pop up, Gg riot:(","replies":[]}]}
