When I pull and he arcane shifts after I connect with the pull, he gets away. Is this supposed to happen? why does his arcane shift override my pull? in my last game this happened 3 times. I pull and connect then his arcane shift goes off and he doesn&#039;t travel towards me, instead he arcane shifts further back. It is really frustrating because it takes away my biggest advantage as a Blitz and his arcane shift doesn&#039;t state that it nullifies spells.\r\n\r\nHas this happened to anyone else?","replies":[{"poster":"HORSE OF FORCE","date":"2015-06-04T11:04:18.104+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Due to the way displacement was coded into League, this is what's \"meant\" to happen. If a displacement occurs when another is in progress, then the latest one will take dominance. The entirety of a pull is considered to be one displacement, so if Ezreal cast Arcane Shift at any point before-hand, he would escape. A way to counter this is to shoot your hook to where you think he's going to Arcane Shift too, ala [Madlife style](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aqVeb0cRdzg&t=00m25s).\n\nThis also occurs with Nautilus, Thresh, and *any* form of crowd control. It's got an **uninterruptable cast time**, meaning that even if Ezreal is subdued to crowd control, the spell will still cast. The exact same thing happens when he's ulting, though it's less noticeable because it's not a mobility move.\n\nYou can look up a list of uninterruptable spell casts. I can't remember where I found it but remembering the common ones is really useful.","replies":[]}]}
