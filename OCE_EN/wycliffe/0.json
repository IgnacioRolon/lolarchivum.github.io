The only trouble that I have is that I have to reinstall the client in order to use which requires a 1320mb download. I think this is because I still have the older client on my computer, anyone know the solution to this?","replies":[{"poster":"Miicka","date":"2016-10-15T00:51:43.252+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Im having the exact same problem too!

Your problem could be related to still having the old client installed but it seems unlikely. I'm upvoting this to try and get Riot to ask the right questions for what's going on. Surely someone will be able to help you.\nGood luck{{sticker:slayer-pantheon-thumbs}}","replies":[]}]}
