So much so that I&#039;ve had at least 1 game where the match was entirely bots except me.. and they&#039;re not very good bots either, a person who AFK&#039;s the entire game would be a better player than these bots..\r\n\r\nDoes Riot have a plan to stop these people? I know curbing cheating is a hassle and a very complicated thing, but then I think of games like RuneScape with their bot nuke that basically broke every single bot in existence for a good month of so, or Valve&#039;s VAC Ban, and think that it shouldn&#039;t really be that hard..","replies":[{"poster":"JasonWazza","date":"2017-12-23T07:30:11.515+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":2,"body":">Does Riot have a plan to stop these people?\n\nRiot doesn't care.","replies":[{"poster":"Apexslide","date":"2017-12-23T07:58:16.714+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yes I kinda figured that because why would they care?

Simply not replying at all would confirm what you said, and saying something would put them into a corner that we expect something to be done.

I'm not asking for an official reply to this for no reason, I have more of a reason than just \"I'm fed up with the amount of bots\". The evidence I've already collected is enough to contradict any PR speech they could throw up willy-nilly.","replies":[{"poster":"JasonWazza","date":"2017-12-23T10:07:08.590+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"yes but the question is, do you think they care about your evidence?","replies":[{"poster":"Apexslide","date":"2017-12-23T19:49:29.371+0000","up_votes":0,"down_votes":0,"body":"Well that's up for debate, because at the end of the day what you're doing is absolutely pointless. You want me to stop asking about this, but don't give me a reason why other than \"Do you think they care?\". That's not a reason nor an excuse, that's just stupid. The fact is these bots have grown en-masse on all servers and Riot needs to do something about it. In their own Terms of Use it clearly states that the use of 3rd party programs, which includes the use of automated systems, isn't allowed. If they don't do something about it, they're violating their own ToS. As a lawyer, I could use that as evidence to bring Riot to court and either have the ToS forcefully changed or have them compensate those effected and put more effort into taking them out.\n\nIn fact I could also argue that they've violated their own ToS many times if I gathered the evidence on it. The Terms of Service for any company aren't there to be ignored by the company itself, they're there for both the consumer and the provider to follow. Failure to do so can, and has in the past, result in legal action against the company.\n\nSo unless you give me a proper reason why I should stop asking for an official response to what they're doing about it, which I'll be frank: I'll ignore your opinion anyway as you're not an official representative, then I'll continue asking.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"saumensch","date":"2017-12-30T17:17:42.219+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"So, tell me riot, why those players using third party havnt be banned? why those players i reported as third party  user i can still meet in game again and again, though bot game, they still annoying and sometimes even destroy or good feelings of the game, like when 4 of ur teammate are bot and i m raka. tell me why in this time, you riot be so slow taking a action against third party. tell me should i keep believe on game quality?\ndisappointing","replies":[{"poster":"Essembie","date":"2017-12-30T21:49:35.333+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=saumensch,realm=OCE,application-id=T8eq2lFQ,discussion-id=XVAj96ZZ,comment-id=0003,timestamp=2017-12-30T17:17:42.219+0000)\n>\n> So, tell me riot, why those players using third party havnt be banned? why those players i reported as third party  user i can still meet in game again and again, though bot game, they still annoying and sometimes even destroy or good feelings of the game, like when 4 of ur teammate are bot and i m raka. tell me why in this time, you riot be so slow taking a action against third party. tell me should i keep believe on game quality?\n> disappointing\n\nthe focus appears to be banning humans for bad words rather than bots for killing the game.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"QAPLA","date":"2017-12-24T00:48:26.302+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"As an ARAM only player, I find bot populations at certain times...\n\nLike in the morning, when few 'real' players are on, I'll get a game that is half bots, any other time it's always 10 'real' players (or at least 9).\n\nThere is a silver lining to this, 3-4 bots on opposing team leads to easy S grades ;)","replies":[]},{"poster":"Essembie","date":"2017-12-23T19:53:12.141+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Right now their priority is dishing out 14 day suspensions for bad words.
