You&rsquo;ll earn +50% extra IP in Ranked Flex between December 7 at 16:00 PST and December 14 at 15:59 PST. Whether you&rsquo;re a solo warrior, a five-person clown fiesta, or anywhere in between, everyone will avail of the same IP bonus.&quot;\r\n\r\nOh really? Well then, that must mean these 2 are in error. Because I damn well didn&#039;t get the IP boost.\r\n\r\nhttp://prntscr.com/diqjqv\r\nhttp://prntscr.com/diqjwa\r\n\r\nYou can&#039;t say there&#039;s IP boost when CLEARLY there isn&#039;t.\r\n\r\nAnd December 14 @ 16:00 PST is still 2 days away.\r\n\r\nSo either I&#039;m doing it wrong, which I&#039;m not because it says Flex or Solo, and I&#039;ve just tried BOTH.. Or you&#039;re fucking lying. Which is it?","replies":[{"poster":"Gehirn","date":"2016-12-13T06:27:35.131+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"The thing you're looking at in [this image](http://prntscr.com/diqjqv) is the IP Boost section, which refers to the IP you could have earned with the IP Boost that you can purchase in the shop.\n\nThe +50% extra IP for Ranked Flex is more than likely included in one of the other green sections that make up that circle. Check them out next time after a Flex game.\n\nSorry for the confusion, we could have avoided saying \"IP boost\" during the announcement, instead referring to it strictly as extra or bonus IP, but no lies I promise. :)","replies":[{"poster":"Apexslide","date":"2016-12-13T07:19:59.271+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"I've checked the green circle in the last 2 games, and both have not given any extra. I've compared these games IP givings to previous games without this supposed IP boost, and the IP given is very similar, regardless of win or loss.\n\nWhich leads me to believe there isn't an IP boost enabled at all, if I can get the same amount of IP from a quick ARAM game without an IP boost.\n\nMaybe be more specific and clarify next time, because I absolutely despise playing Ranked because of all the toxic wannabe trick2g people who ping you at the slightest mistake and force me to modify the game code to turn off Pings altogether, since I can't just 'turn them down'.","replies":[]}]}]}
