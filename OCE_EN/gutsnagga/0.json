S - S+ is easiest on an ADC cause you essentially spend the entire match doing something. Jungle is a real RIP you have to end the game @ like 20 for the best chance of getting an S+ token. Not sure how many Towers & Epic monsters you contributed too aswell they have an impact. I've gone 5/5/5 (just an example) but a flat even score but taken 4 dragons and 7 towers and achieved S.","replies":[]},{"poster":"SmaugCity","date":"2016-10-12T16:11:59.903+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"When you reach full build farming should no longer matter - obviously there are exceptions, but generally speaking the appropriate metric should be gold over time not minions over time.","replies":[]},{"poster":"WoadKethunt","date":"2016-10-12T09:09:00.310+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"same with jungle, it doesn't matter if i spend the entire game choking the life out of the enemy jungler and tilt the ever living shit out of the laners, if i dont have 200 farm at 20 mins i get nothing, its almost like rito are telling you control jungling  isn't good","replies":[]},{"poster":"Cyrater","date":"2016-10-12T06:21:39.565+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Literally every time a post like this comes up the answer is always farm.
