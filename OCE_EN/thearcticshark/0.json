In all it's glory, and all it's cringe. And while I know this won't ever be put in the game, as I threw every offensive joke that could possibly relate to Australia in here, and this would make the SJW chuck a fit. But I made this for fun, and it was a sort of spur of the moment thing, so I'll keep it up     \n\nWell why not just have Lamb be sheep for the new Zealanders, and have Wolf be a dingo for us. I mean both of them are things that we're known to be affiliated with, with the fact that there are more sheep than people in new Zealand and the court case with the dingo eating someones baby over here in Australia. But they&#039;re also things that we use to poke fun at each other with, whenever I greet any of my friends from new Zealand I always greet them with &quot;Oi get over here ya sheep fucker&quot; and they in turn often make jokes about bogan mums losing their babies and blaming it on Dingoes.\n\nA skin like this would perfectly shows the relationship between our two countries as while we may make fun of each other (hell even our governments have been known to make some snarky comments from time to time) we&#039;re still inseparable. You could even reflect this in the skin voice over, the Dingo could be like us Australians, and of course be rather brash, loud and always cracking jokes at everyone else&#039;s expense, while the Sheep could (ironically) be sheepish and the the more level headed of the two, being the one that would keep Dingo in line while also looking out for him. some examples of what they could say:\n\n**Taunts:**\nSheep: Hey, we don&#039;t want any trouble now-\nDingo: If this wanka keeps on staring at me like that, I&#039;ma rip his bloody head off!\n \n**Jokes: **\nDingo: Mate, if you hit me, I&#039;m gonna turn you into a bloody pie!\nSheep: Alright! Calm down bro!\n\nDingo: Sheep, this is the reason we aren&#039;t allowed gun!\nSheep: I thought you were supposed to be the rule breaker here\n\nDIngo: Ey bru, lets go get some fosh and chops cuzzie bru!\nSheep: We sound nothing like that!\n\nSheep: Aww mate, I reckon we should go to the pub and get in a fight for the sake of it\nDingo: Great minds think alike, don&#039;t they mate?\n\nSheep: I&#039;m the hiphopopotamus, my lyrics are bottomless...\nDingo: You gonna keep going?\nSheep: Bugger off!\n\nSheep: Dingo, do you think you could teach me how to dropkick\nDingo: You&#039;re a bloody dropkick!\n\n**Directed taunts:**\nAhri\nDingo: Mate we&#039;re missing out, I reckon she bangs like a dunny door\nSheep: Have some Decency, Dingo!\n\nNasus:\nDingo: Ain&#039;t late game yet ya mongrel!\nSheep: Don&#039;t make him hate us Dingo, it&#039;s just gonna be worse later!\n\nAlistar:\nDingo: Mate you&#039;re about as useful as tits on a bull!\nSheep: Cuzzie, you&#039;re speaking to a literal bull!\n\nBard:\nDingo: My grandfather fought and died in the war against your kind!\nSheep: Dingoes once fought in a war against the star kin?\nDingo: No! It&#039;s because He looks like something straight out of a- augh forget it!\n\nSona:\nDingo: You reckon she&#039;ll bite?\nSheep: Sorry bro, I don&#039;t see it happening\n\nCaitlin:\nDingo: Aw if it isn&#039;t a bloody pom! How&#039;s it going mate?\nSheep: Miss, you might want to run now\n\nNidalee:\nDingo: Oi hun! Show us your map of Tasmania!\nSheep: Keep it covered please!\n\nAnnie/Amumu:\nDingo: Augh, so many little ankle bitters!\nSheep: Wonder how they got so good at brawling?\n\nCho&#039;gath: \nDingo: Mark my words, this thing&#039;s a yank.\nSheep: nah bro, I hear he&#039;s from a place called the void \nDingo: They&#039;re all bloody voids!\n\nLee Sin:\nDingo: And a %%%%%%%%%%% nip nong to you too young man!\nSheep: Shut ya trap Dingo!\n\nYasou:\nDingo: Take my advice mate, keep walking \nSheep: Well he should be good it by now, running from his past and everything\nDingo: I think you mean cowering from it!\n\nMalzahar:\nDingo: WERE. YOU. BORN. HERE\nSheep: He doesn&#039;t look like he&#039;s from Ionia or Bilgewater \nDingo: Don&#039;t ignore him, he clearly said he&#039;s from Syria!\n\nVlad: \nDingo: Aw bonzer! You come pre blood covered! \nSheep: So do we still have to fight him?\nDingo: Don&#039;t wuss out on me mate!\n\nUdyr: \nDingo: Mate, Let me teach you Dingo stance!\nSheep: What about Sheep stance?\nDingo: Eh, might as well \n\nFiddlesticks:\nDingo: Fiddlesticks aye? heheheh\nSheep: I know what you&#039;re thinking bro\n\nFiora:\nDingo: Might wanna just ff and save us both the hassle \nSheep: Bro, I think you&#039;re making her mad\n\nRenekton:\nDingo: I reckon you&#039;d look good wearing croc skin\nSheep: World could surely do without this guy \n\nEzreal: \nDingo: Ahahahahaha! You gonna wear a rainbow dress and earrings too!\nSheep: I can&#039;t disagree with you on this one bro!\n\nTaric: \nDingo: Mate, I reckon we could sell that armor for heaps on gum tree\nSheep: It&#039;s his armor, and we&#039;re not stealing it\nDingo: Aw c&#039;mon mate! I&#039;ll split it with ya, 30 70, how bout it? \n\nKarthus: \nDingo: I think that guy was my dinner last arvo\nSheep: So even you can&#039;t keep a bad meal down\n\nJayce: \nDingo: Oi, pretty boy what&#039;s your number!?\nSheep: The hair is pretty convincing\n\nShaco:\nDingo: Heath is dead! Let&#039;em rest in peace!\nSheep: I&#039;m sure he means nothing by it, bro\n\nTryndamere:\nDingo: This bloke&#039;s mad as a cut snake!\nSheep: Can we avoid him?\nDingo: As if, mate!\n\n**Movement:**\n\nDingo: Aw, I could eat the arse out of a low flying duck!\n\nDingo: Time for a scrap!\n\nSheep: Why do you think people avoid us so much?\nDIngo: It&#039;s because you smell like a chocolate miner mate!\n\nSheep: Bro, I think the mid lane would be the perfect place to start a picnic \nDingo: Or some panic!\n\nSheep: Ah it&#039;s a gorgeous day!\n\n**Recalling:**\n\nDingo: Mate, I gotta let the aboriginals swim in the pool for a bit\n\nSheep: We won&#039;t be gone long, don&#039;t worry\n\n**Marking someone**\n\nDingo: You&#039;re stuffed mate!\n\nDingo: Pointing the bone at you mate, watch yourself!\n\nDingo: I&#039;ma beat you to a bloody pulp!\n\nSheep: Be careful now\n\nSheep: Don&#039;t cross us bro\n\n**Killing the mark**\n\nDingo: Stay down there for a bit!

And you&#039;re belly up!\n\nDingo: Might head down to the pub later to celebrate!\n\nDingo: Aw, my bellies chocka full!\n\nSheep: We gave you plenty of warning, and you did nothing\n\nSheep: You forced this on yourself!\n\nSheep: We&#039;re really sorry about this\nDingo: No we&#039;re not!\n\nSheep: Bro, It&#039;s a Dingoes breakfast\nDingo: Except I actually get to eat! \n\n**Failing to kill the mark**\n\nDingo: You useless mongrel!\n\nDingo: You&#039;re a bloody knob head!\n\nDingo: This really is a Dingoes breakfast!\n\nDingo: You&#039;re little tool!\n\nSheep: Hey! what was that for!\n\nSheep: We needed that bro!\n\nSheep: We&#039;ll remember this bro\nDingo: Especially when you&#039;re broken and bleeding with every inside on the outside!\n\n**Activating Wolfs Frenzy**\n\nSheep: Let&#039;em have it bro\nDingo: Finally!\n\nDingo: Have a go!\n\nDingo: G&#039;day mate!\n\n**Activating mounting dread**\n\nSheep: I reckon they can feel it\nDingo: Oh they&#039;ll feel it alright  \n\nSheep: Hey bru, wait for a sec!\n\nDingo: Bonzer!\n\n**Activating Lambs respite **\n\nDingo: You Beauty!\n\nDingo: You&#039;re a bloody legend mate!\nSheep: Cheers bro!\n\nDingo: This is why you&#039;re my best mate!\nSheep: Anytime bro!\n\nAnd while I know what I&#039;m proposing is more of a legendary skin then anything, you could still just cut the price to something like a normal skin cost, and if you still feel like donating the proceedings to a charity, at least make it for an animal rights joint just to be funny\n\nBut seriously though riot, make {{champion:203}}  an aussie/new zealander skin and that shit will sell like hot cross buns","replies":[{"poster":"Tele","date":"2015-10-02T05:54:02.697+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"You know there's more than just New Zealand and Australian players on OCE?

Sure it took a while, but whatever, it's here now and it's awesome.\n\nAn idea like yours would leave certain players out felling left out, such as Papua New Guinean and Polynesian players. Your idea is also pretty cringe honestly.","replies":[{"poster":"TheArcticShark","date":"2016-01-24T12:28:52.074+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Damn, there goes my self esteem. But I guess an apology is in order, I wasn't really aware of our servers being shared by so many other people, since I'm fairly new to this game and I've come from other moba's that gave us our own separate servers, so I kinda just assumed OCE was for aussies and new zealanders.
