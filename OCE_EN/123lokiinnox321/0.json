The community can't maintain both \"why are people not getting banned for doing wrong\", and \"I wasn't doing anything wrong to get this ban\" which is just as popular and frequently seen as the former, at the same time because they're contradictory. However what can be said about these 2 sentiments is definitely NOT that the banning system isn't working.\n\n**Point #2:**\n\n> There is a difference between being salty/toxic and being honest.. but hey... you can't be honest.. people nowadays get upset...\n\nThere is also a difference between living in your own little world and being considerate and respectful of others. Those \"truth-speakers\" way more often than not, are nothing more than self-glorified egoist, and you know it. It's also a fallacy that being honest equals being right, it isn't the case at all.\n\n**Point #3:**\n\n> Well seriously people make an absolute mockery of your system and enjoy torementing and greifing others\n\nYour narrative contradicts itself by having point #3 running into dissonance with point #2. Much like what is mentioned in point #1, you can't use narratives that run in opposite directions still want them work, you can't at one hand that says \"people are wrong\" while the other that says \"see? that's where people are right\". Which is it?\n\n**Point #4:**\n\n> but hey like I said you don't care what these people do to other ls or how they make them feel!!!\n\nBut then you come around to say that people are banned because we are fee-fees who can't take anything?

Hence where's your concern?\n\nJust because you believe that Riot's banning system is total garbage and is targeting at the wrong people or something, it doesn't automatically makes it the case.","replies":[{"poster":"123Lokiinnox321","date":"2016-12-26T12:17:40.491+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"How is it working when games today I played with people with a history of 0/7/0,  0/15/0 etc and this is not a history of 1 2 or 3 games we are talking 95% of their games..\nAnd they are out there cause some people out there don't report or cbf and the opposing team thinks it funny not to report cause \"Hey they ain't on my team and I am getting fed and a free win\"\n\nP.S : with all my years of gaming I have never gone into a forum to post.. but LoL has got to be the worst game for trolls period ","replies":[{"poster":"SEKAI","date":"2016-12-26T12:39:18.378+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=123Lokiinnox321,realm=OCE,application-id=T8eq2lFQ,discussion-id=TsEEbPEw,comment-id=0000000000000000,timestamp=2016-12-26T12:17:40.491+0000)\n>\n> How is it working when games today I played with people with a history of 0/7/0,  0/15/0 etc and this is not a history of 1 2 or 3 games we are talking 95% of their games..\n> And they are out there cause some people out there don&#x27;t report or cbf and the opposing team thinks it funny not to report cause &quot;Hey they ain&#x27;t on my team and I am getting fed and a free win&quot;\n> \n> P.S : with all my years of gaming I have never gone into a forum to post.. but LoL has got to be the worst game for trolls period\n\nBecause anecdotes is not representative of the overall statistic. There are what, 10-20 million players who play daily, and even every single one of they only play a single match every day, that's still 10-20 million matches played every single day. How many have you played today, do you think that means anything in front of that number?\n\nSecondly, there is also the report bias. Because happy people won't complain, while only the ones running into issues would. So we often only read those that complain and bash on whatever and develop the cognitive bias that \"things are bad\" when a lot of times it's actually not true or not anywhere as severe.\n\nThirdly, there are also many other factors in play, so let's list the most noticeable ones: You've got holiday season, you've got preseason, you've got different ranks that already contains wildly different player mindset, you've got different people to be more likely to play in different times of the day, and you've also got where luck and matchmaking take you to. It all depends.\n\nLastly, Riot can't auto monitor every single match, it's impossible purely out of the amount of matches there are everyday, so they rely on players to help regulation by hoping that they report diligently against nasties. And when people do use the system, and report their part, people do get banned. But yes, many people simply don't report, but that's hardly the system's problem in this instance, it's people that don't use them to their purpose and effectiveness. I mean, you can blame the car for handling like ass, but you can't blame the car for not driving you to work on its own.\n\nP.S.: A lot of games have troll problems that tear people's hairs out, Dota2, FIFA and most shooter games all share the same problem. Problem isn't much to do with individual game and how trolls are handled there, but rather it's to do with the fact most games are competitive in some manner and that players are anonymous behind user names, so they troll just because they can get away with it. It's that simple.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]}
