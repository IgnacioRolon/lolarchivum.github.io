The reason for this policy is to prevent situations devolving into full-on arguments, witch hunts and the like.\n\nMy understanding of the moderation that actually goes into it is that threads typically aren't deleted unless the identifying information can't be edited out (which I *think* is only a problem when entered into the optional \"link\" box on thread creation, as that can't be edited) *or* when the thread devolves into a state of intense toxicity, in which case it doesn't matter what the thread is about it would get deleted anyway.\n\nSo far as contacting a human and/or triggering manual reviews, there is the option of submitting a ticket to [Support](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/requests/new) (for reporting players, use the \"Report cheating, phishing, or negative in-game behavior\" option) with any available evidence (such as screenshots/videos, chat logs [if you've kept a record of what was said] etc). To be clear, you'll likely just get a generic response simply stating that they'll look into the case and that they wont be able to inform you of any action taken (which differs from reporting in-game as you wont be able to receive an IFS notification). They'll likely also recommend you use the post-game report option where possible (that's standard procedure for the support staff when dealing with player behaviour reports).","replies":[{"poster":"WaxLadrian","date":"2018-09-10T09:20:06.548+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"\"it's when people start identifying others as rule-breakers that it becomes a problem\"\nReally, because if I had a list of people who frequently int, grief and throw ranked games and I saw one in my lobby I may just dodge.

How is that a bad thing?\n\nRealistically? Because it's not hard to make unsubstantiated claims that another player is a rule-breaker, and it's also possible to fake evidence that someone *is* a rule-breaker, and let's not forget all the players that get called out for nothing more than having a bad game and/or being on tilt. If the \"no name and shame\" policy didn't exist and you made such a list, you'd probably end up with a bunch of players who aren't actually rule-breakers on it, and you may well end up with so many that you trigger LeaverBuster with all that dodging.\n\n> Protecting trolls isnt a thing.\n\nWho said it was about protecting trolls? It's about protecting *people*. As I said, it's not hard to make unsubstantiated claims against others, and how do you think it would feel to be the target of such claims? The \"no name and shame\" policy exists to prevent such scenarios, at least on the boards. You want to know what else it exists to prevent? Players who come onto the boards to call out these trolls, and in doing so stoop to their level, because ultimately that *not* a solution or a discussion, that's just adding to the toxicity and making more trolls.\n\nPoint being, the \"no name and shame\" policy exists more to protect the people like you than it does to protect the actual troublemakers, and you might have figured that out if you just took the time to think about it objectively.\n\n> Page 1 of the oce forums there is legit a troll post about suicide and people telling each other to k... them selves etc\n\n*Forums* or *boards*? Because if it's the *forums*, I feel it's important to point out that none of the current mods had *any* such power back then (and if it is the forums, I think I know the thread you're referring to). Thing is, the current mods are all part of the Volunteer program, which didn't exists when the forums did. The mods that *did* exist back then were all Riot employed, and (being *completely* honest) there was much less care that went into moderating the forums back then. Not to mention the difference in culture that exists, some of the regulars were a bit like that back then, and so it wasn't so uncommon for mods to be more lenient to that kind of behaviour and attitude back then. You'd find that the current mods are much more strict in that sense, in part probably due to the fact that that culture died long ago.\n\nSo I ask you this; is it relevant to compare the current state of the boards and it's moderators to that of the forums and the forum moderators? I'd firmly debate for a \"no\", personally.\n\n> rather than clogging up a support ticket which takes time from people fixing bugs etc, make I dont know... a report a troll email that people can send these thing to? imagine if someone had that genius idea.\n\nYou mean, the *exact* reason they created a ticket category for reporting players? Why bother to create a new system when the current system is set to deal with the issue. All the player behaviour tickets get sent to the Player Behaviour team anyway, so it's not as if it's really \"clogging up\" anything beyond what is necessary. All you're really suggesting with that is extra steps and effort to do the same thing that already happens.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Aneirin","date":"2018-09-10T02:02:28.748+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"> Had a post get deleted by a mod because apparently pointing out trolls is bad\n\nNo, because witchhunting is bad; and photoshop is a thing.

Second, there are plenty of other reasons that such evidence can still be misleading. Perhaps the account was compromised, perhaps the person in the wrong changed their summoner name, and now some other innocent player has it etc etc.\n\nThere are far too many abuse cases to allow such content on a public platform, which is why support allows private reporting.\n\n>retire mods, have a tribunal. simple.\n\nBoards moderation and game moderation are two wholly separate entities. Even if a tribunal was introduced, retiring boards mods would simply leave boards without moderation and have absolutely no impact on anything else.\n\n>have 1 staffer sit there watching vids\n\nI'm not sure how you think that is even remotely possible, even on a region as small as OCE. Tribunal was a deeply flawed system that produced far more false positives and required far more official oversight than the IFS does. There are dozens of threads on this topic. Tribunal never came to OCE for a reason, and it was replaced on NA and other regions for the same.","replies":[]}]}]}]}
