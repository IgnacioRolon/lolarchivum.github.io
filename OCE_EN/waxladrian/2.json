Obviously its nothing like scripting or anything that helps with actual game play, its just user info and I have seen some streamers using it and advertising it on twitch etc so I was just wondering if its the type of thing you can be banned for etc.","replies":[{"poster":"Talon12","date":"2018-08-25T01:52:51.333+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Overwolf isnt explicitly restricted, they do say its accepted even, but there is a small chance the bot will pick it up and ban you.\n\n> We never formally approve any applications and blanket green light them to be guaranteed safe, because there is always a chance the apps can change down the road or the situation pivot.

In the case of this particular application, while it's on the line, we did clear it for being compliant with our current policies.
