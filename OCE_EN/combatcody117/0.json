Personally, I think that Riot should make it 20 seconds until you can lock in your champion, that way we all have time to negotiate who is in which lane. \r\n\r\nAny Suggestions On This Idea?","replies":[{"poster":"Rocka","date":"2016-01-11T07:12:33.947+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"It wouldn't change anything, but the new champ select is coming soon so look forward to that!","replies":[]},{"poster":"JasonWazza","date":"2016-01-10T10:25:21.301+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Just to be clear, that wouldn't help as they would just lock at the end of the 20 seconds.\n\nBut yeah hopefully the new champ select will be available in norm's.","replies":[{"poster":"AndyMacManiac","date":"2016-01-10T15:31:04.905+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"yea totally agree with ya","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Eliea","date":"2016-01-10T08:56:13.601+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"RIOT are going to be handling this, the new Champion Select (Posted here: http://boards.oce.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/announcements/Mc1nPqMw-new-champion-select-coming-to-ranked-soon) Should be taking over the current Blind pick for Normals!
