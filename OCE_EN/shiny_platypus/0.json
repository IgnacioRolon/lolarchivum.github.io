I'm picking Shadow Isles because of Eve, but with her rework her lore will be updated, and there was mention a few months ago that the Shadow Isles part may change.\n\nThanks :)","replies":[{"poster":"Peach Platypus","date":"2017-09-06T08:23:33.473+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You sure can :D Check out the About-us text channel for info on changing cities!","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Iil vayne","date":"2017-09-05T22:06:48.790+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Come say hello! we organize fun events and there's always somebody to play with!","replies":[]},{"poster":"Iil vayne","date":"2017-09-05T15:52:04.345+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Come join us :D we like to play with new people!","replies":[]},{"poster":"Iil vayne","date":"2017-09-05T11:36:12.364+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Come say hello!
