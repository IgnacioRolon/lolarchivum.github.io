Perhaps if you werent one of the shit bronze/silver supports that the OP is talking about you'd know what its like","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Aneirin","date":"2018-09-16T22:42:56.906+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Building a gold item isn't a waste of gold; in fact not building it would be the waste. \nNot using your sighstone isn't any more punishable than not using your trinket or not using the actives on your items.

Total vision score across both teams 0.\n\n\nit's not trolling, people are just actually that bad.
