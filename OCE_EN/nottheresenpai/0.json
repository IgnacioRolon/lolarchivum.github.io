It seems to me that all the champions who have been affected (Zed, Vi, Sona, Garen) sort of looks like the new icons have a windy, flowing theme with the flower petals flowing over the champion. I was thinking this could be hinting at the character in yasuo&#039;s lore who uses wind based abilities. \r\n\r\nIf this isn&#039;t the case could the person from yasuo&#039;s lore be the samurai we briefly see in the project skin trailer ?","replies":[{"poster":"Master Farmer","date":"2016-01-04T21:44:39.306+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"***","replies":[{"poster":"lordofrage","date":"2016-01-04T22:06:30.648+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=LlamaGodOfThunde,realm=OCE,application-id=Ntey9fRZ,discussion-id=B8agj1EZ,comment-id=0000,timestamp=2016-01-04T21:44:39.306+0000)\n>\n> I don't believe deadeye has any connection to Yasuo as 4 champions that he has affected are mid(Zed), top(Garen), support(Sona) and jungler(Vi). Also if u look at zed's teaser the bullet thing exits the body out with flowers which I believe are representing life, which has been drawn from him. Similer with Vi's how her teaser shows her losing her gloves while in the icon it shows fire which is showing piltover on fire. So probably not wind from yasuo.\n\nik this is so stupid but in fioras splash art theres roses an ik it has nothing for her but all the update thing shes getting idk ik its a stupid theory XD","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Firebolt","date":"2016-01-06T13:11:27.492+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-HVMJ6VUUGKQ/VoG1d7t-6nI/AAAAAAAA2W8/N2IWF2Xbw8E/s1600/sn.jpg\n\nOr Deadeye could be just some jerk who picks on mute women cause why the hell not?!\nJokes aside, there are a lot of interesting speculations on the net of who Deadeye is/what his purpose is. It has been already confirmed though he's a Marksman, so he's definitely not a samurai. There is also nothing really to hint at Deadeye being related to Yasuo at all.","replies":[{"poster":"Talon12","date":"2016-01-06T13:26:42.527+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"could be a samurai who throws katana!
