But did I last game then lose honour causing me to reach lvl1 with nearly filled bar for lvl 2 again?\n\nWhen do you actually lose honour progress? was it because I played with 4 premades that got slightly agitated when I started the match saying one of them was playing too risky resulting in feeding, did they all report me?\n\nI have the feeling going down rank is easier then leveling up. \nWhat is the goal of the honour rankings? (the top 10% most supportive reach lvl3, 80% is level 2 and the most toxic 10% is level 1?)\nin that case I understand its not easy to reach lvl 3 and I can still be glad that im not level 0 (no rewards at all), however I feel like I&#039;m missing out on rewards now (The droprate of the keys already feels super low, even when I was level 2)\n\nSo future ideas:\nmore clarity to players: \n  + show their progress, \n  + explain what is meant with the different colourings in the circular progress bar in post-game analysis\n  + explain that it is hard to quantify, so that is the reason why there is no progress bar in each players profile\n  + explain what influences honour drops: reports? and honour rise: receiving honour? handing out honour?\n\nLastly I must say this new honoursystem isnt too bad, I like the idea of it but for now Im not fully satisfied by the excecution. Maybe it is because I didnt investigate the mechanics of the new honour system. I hope this feedback will be a contribution to a non-toxic League of Legends Community\n\nKind regards,\nStoerevent","replies":[{"poster":"Project Xayah","date":"2017-07-26T04:23:52.479+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Generally, drops in Honour levels are tied to punishable offences and punishments themselves. For example, if you were to be consistently reported for chat offences, and it was deemed the reports were accurate, you'd likely drop down to level 1 (as you are saying you have), or even down to level 0 (probably only if you were at level 1 at the time). More serious offences are more likely too drop you straight to level 0, though. I'm not entirely sure, but I think very minor instances can also cause you to lose some progress but not necessarily drop levels.\n\nAs for what influences increases in Honour, the bare minimum is, as the [FAQ](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/115008474148) puts it, \"Just show up, don't be an asshole, and you'll rise over the coming weeks and months.\" Receiving Honour will obviously increase your progress, though only slightly, and giving Honour also has the chance to give you a bit of bonus progress (this will only occur if everyone on the team Honours someone).\n\nWhile there's no specific information about Honour progress being \"hard to quantify\", as you put it, in the FAQ or announcement page, several Rioters have stated that there's some pretty crazy algorithms used to determine when a player levels up, which could make it more confusing to include the tracker, such as [Marauder's response](https://boards.oce.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/gameplay-strategy/JxiotXoA-is-there-a-counter-for-honor-like-can-i-track-my-process?comment=0001) to a thread asking about progress tracking about a month ago (and the reddit post that information came from).","replies":[]}]}
