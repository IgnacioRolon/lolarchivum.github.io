In a way to pay homage to LoL&#039;s low-poly roots, imagine being able to play as pre-rework Garen, TF, Annie, and the list goes on. Considering some heavy work would need to be done, these could be 1350 Anniversary skins. I think it&#039;d be really fun, and a nice way for people to get a good nostalgia fix at the same time!","replies":[]}
