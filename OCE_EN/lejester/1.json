I&#039;m creating a post in order to satisfy the trouble I&#039;m having when engaging as an ADC in a fight. Take for example, I play a game as Kog&#039;Maw. I have 3 items, and am prepared to demolish the enemy frontline and force the team to retreat. The next action I take before engaging is to stand far away back, activate W, and than start firing. However, this often doesn&#039;t work in my favor as my frontline get&#039;s CC&#039;ed into obilivion and than expose to me to the assassins who one-shot me. Now, that&#039;s obviously just one scenario, and I know there&#039;s many more. I just want tips on how to engage and position my self correctly(Dragon, baron, full 5v5, ect).\r\n\r\nNote: I&#039;m lvl 28, so the terms I use and the things I&#039;m asking for may be totally incompetent or be not necessary due to my lack of LoL experience.","replies":[{"poster":"kl4060","date":"2016-05-28T03:01:18.979+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"I would say it's not the most ideal thing to engage in a teamfight as an ADC.\nBut if you really want to make flashy plays... Unless your mechanics are crazy, wait until the enemy's threats are down (cc or burst).\nFor example, you would not engage with their Malph and/or Veigar ult up unless you can burst them down before they use it.\nAlso, if they have a hard click-on cc, I would not even try. Engaging as ADC is all about staying alive by dodging damage.\n\nAnd most importantly... I don't believe even the best of ADCs can engage as a champion like Kog (unless you kill them before they do anything or you've got the godlike Korean movements, unlikely...)\nBecause as ADC, your relative DPS is generally greater than your bust, you want to constantly spray damage while kiting in the fight. Try picking a champion that you can do that on. (such as VAYNE, Kalista) AND PLEASE, save your mobility spell until you really need it, don't tumble into your doom for extra damage.\n\nORRRRR~~~ play Ashe or something. Just ult and congrats, you have initiated a fight!","replies":[]},{"poster":"Biggest Gimp OCE","date":"2016-05-28T02:03:36.905+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"adc does not engage, let the tank engage","replies":[]},{"poster":"SteelerKing","date":"2016-06-01T17:08:45.917+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"**In a game where your team does not work together well or if your team comp does not allow for a proper formation:**\nDepends heavily on your team and the enemy team. If they are a tanky team or full of duellers(Jax, Trynda etc.), do not engage.\nChances are that you will lose in a head-to-head fight. If your team is full of pokers, poke the enemy to low health before you even think of engaging - if at all.\nMost of the time it's best to figure out whom of the enemy team are the biggest threats and aim for those first. And I don't mean which of the enemy team has the most threatening champ but who of the enemy is the biggest threat in terms of player skill, because you do not want that one to get fed and if he is fed you want to focus that one first at all times. Best would be to ambush him if you get the opportunity.\nYour position is of minor importance there. By a rule of thumb, try not to stay in the line of sight of too many enemies. That way you won't get focused as hard and can dish out damage from the side unnoticed if lucky.\n\n**In a game where your team seems to work together:**\nStay as far away from everyone and everything that is an enemy as possible.\nShoot at the target closest to you. Always. Doesn't matter if it's the enemy tank or a squishy, you never head out like an assassin, jumping into range of the enemy squishies. You stay at the back, in range of 1 enemy, your current target.\nYou melt away all the enemies one by one and they die.\nIn some situations(if you notice that your tank for example has a tunnel view or your support does not stick to you) it is best to just align to your partners and stay close to your allied champs like Support, Bruiser and Tank. They will try not to let you die and if you happen to get outside of their view during a fight it is very likely that you will get isolated from your team and taken out by an assassin or likewise.","replies":[{"poster":"Lejester","date":"2016-06-07T23:25:09.454+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thanks.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Gr1fter","date":"2016-06-01T08:12:41.052+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'm not an ADC main, in fact it's probably my worst role.

You sit at the backline, keep your mobile abilities if you have any handy,  Focus on priority targets, let your team CC divers and tanks. Focus on surviving above all else.\n\nIf an assassin locks onto you burn your flash or use a disengage ability if you have them available. Also take QSS which builds into mercurial scimitar so you can use the active to negate CC. \n\nI remember playing {{champion:22}} and I would always use my ult on {{champion:238}} the instant he burned his shadow or tried his ult. \n\n{{champion:96}} is a bit tricky because while he has really high dps, he is extremely squishy, immobile and lacks any kind of hard CC to engage or disengage which I think makes him one of my least picked adcs because he really relies on just out damaging his opponent straight up and his own team applying the CC. \n\nYou have to make sure the area around you has plenty of vision, keep your distance from assassins, let your team peel, build a defensive item like guardian angels, steraks, etc if you see an assassin, throw out any CC that way and prioritize them.
