Either the bot get&#039;s poked into oblivion and the enemy remains at 80% health or the opposing top-laner is simply too tanky for his counterpart. This forces me to just farm with champions such as Twisted Fate, which we all know isn&#039;t healthy for Twisted Fate to be sitting in lane. So, that being said, when should I pick roaming mid-lanners, such as {{champion:4}} , or even {{champion:136}} . I really don&#039;t know, and it&#039;s a shame because I personally enjoy playing these champions except It&#039;s hard when I can&#039;t utilize them correctly. \r\n{{sticker:zombie-brand-mindblown}} \r\n\r\n*Note I&#039;m B2 and it&#039;s my first season playing LoL so I may say things that are totally obvious or unnecessary.","replies":[{"poster":"Lord Sesshomaru","date":"2016-06-14T04:14:26.735+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I used to play TF a LOT, and now Sol is my go-to champion and I'm playing a lot of Taliyah too. So i can try and offer a little advice.\n\nall 3 of those champions have the unique ability of being able to gank over terrain, so in situations where a gank wouldn't be that successful (if the lane is evenly pushed, or your team has pushed a little too far) those champs can still pull off a fairly successful gank. So don't be too afraid to gank an evenly pushed lane with one of those champs. \n\nWhen the enemy is at 80% hp and your bot lane is being poked into oblivion, your bot lane should be under their own tower, when this is the case, you can gank  very close to your own tower, and even if the enemy has more HP they cant engage a 2v3 under the tower, so you come in, stun the ADC, and then do as much damage as you can to them in the time that it takes them to run back to a safer engaging distance.  \nOr if they are not pushed under turret you can coordinate your gank with the jungler, so it becomes a 4v2. \n\nAlways ping the shit out of the 'on my way' ping when you're about to gank, nothing is worse than ulting in as TF into a 1v2 and dying instantly while your team types 'sorry wasn't paying attention'. BUT always communicate to your team if you have to abandon the gank (say you run into the enemy jungler along the way) because otherwise your team gets too cocky and engages not realising that you cant make it in time anymore. \n\nWhen you gank a lane, if you kill the enemy laner (or both if its bot lane) don't just go back to your lane straight away, do all you can to try take the turret.\n\nIn my opinion, always prioritise bot lane over top lane, there is the chance of bursting more flashes, getting more kills, and feeding the player that really matters (the ADC) AND the possibility of doing dragon after the gank. Id rather have a fed Nasus on the enemy team and a fed Vayne on my team, than the other way around. \n\nAlso when going back to your lane from a gank, its usually better to go back to the jungle, I've had enough katarina's and Fizz's jump out of the bushes in the river and taking you down while all your spells are on CD for me to wise up. \n\nAlso when ganking as one of those 3 champs, youll want to aim your entry a fair way behind your opponents. Sol because when they see you coming they always run back to their tower (even if it means running towards your stun) Taliyah because they can see your ult coming and you mis-judge how long it takes you to get there and they walk over it to safety, not only have you wasted your ult, but you have stopped your team from chasing them too, And TF because if you ult right on top of them, instead of running (especially bot lane) they can sit there and smash you as soon as you pop in. \n\nAlways beware what champions they have before banking though,\n\nif you're Sol and they have a Jhin, youll want to make sure that the river isn't warded because taking damage stops Comet of Legend, and Jhin can hit you with Deadly flourish ling before you reach his lane (if he sees you)\n\nIf you're TF youll want to be careful of Blitz Thresh, Leona etc. because they can grab/stun you as soon as you pop in, (and TF is a might too squishy to be CC'ed for that long mid fight)\n\nif you're Taliyah, youll want to be careful of Ezreal (who can jump over your wall easy peasy, wasting your gank), Thresh because if he can get to the other side of the wall, he can pull the ADC across as well, and Vayne, who can push you back into and stun you against your own wall and burst you down before your team gets there.\n\nAnyway thats a little bit of help, hope it is useful.","replies":[]}]}
