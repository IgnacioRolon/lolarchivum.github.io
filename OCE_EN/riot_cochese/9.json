Discovered a bug with Marauder Ashe in a Co op Vs. AI Intro game. She was automatically sent on a course to the enemy Nexus (red side) any time you moved from the fountain and clicking around the minimap or screen wouldn't change her course. The only way to stop was to recall or press S. Her abilities worked fine. I could fire R in any direction and same with E and W. This was rather frustrating.{{item:3070}} \n\n-Denki","replies":[]},{"poster":"Charmer Bird","date":"2015-07-17T00:30:47.070+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"More than late haha.
