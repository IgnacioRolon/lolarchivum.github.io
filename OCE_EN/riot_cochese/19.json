We took a look and found that a setting was incorrectly left off, after the 5.2 patch last week. We have since corrected this setting and the feature should be working as intended. Please let me know in this thread, if you continue to see any issues with end of game gifting.\r\n\r\nWe are now looking into rootcause, as to why this setting changed after the patch, and have added a check to our verification test to ensure we don't patch without this setting correct.\r\n\r\nApologies for all this affected and big shout out to summoner:  **DancingStranger** who alerted us to this issue.\r\n\r\nGL;HF\r\nRiot Cochese","replies":[{"poster":"HORSE OF FORCE","date":"2015-02-07T01:56:14.904+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Could be connected to how you improperly configured the new hardware :P","replies":[]}]}
