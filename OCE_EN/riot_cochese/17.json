Unfortunately he was activated before the content was patched out, and for those players, you should have been refunded within the hour. Ekko is now released and available in the store.\n\nI know that some of you will encounter issues with the new patch, it happens. Please check the reddit megathread here for most game bugs being reported (Our Dev team is actively tracking in this forum): http://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/37jzvq/510_patch_bugs_megathread/\n\nI hope you all have a great experience with the new patch, the changes, and the new champ Ekko. Please post here if you find yourself in need of some help though.\n\nGL;HF\nRiot Cochese","replies":[{"poster":"Riot Cochese","date":"2015-05-29T10:01:11.277+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"We try to do this for every content patch.","replies":[{"poster":"HORSE OF FORCE","date":"2015-05-29T13:29:45.727+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I probably missed some because I'm not active on reddit.
