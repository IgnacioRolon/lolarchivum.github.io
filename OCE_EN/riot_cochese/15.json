Another player in my team in the same game got disconnected and was lagging hard too. she afked for about 25 mins, going active and inactive most of the time.\n\nWe pretty much gave up that game, and fighting a loosing battle.  \n\nTy for looking into this issue, Sir.\n\nI highly appreciate your help on this matter.\n\nThanking you","replies":[{"poster":"Riot Cochese","date":"2015-02-05T21:37:52.563+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"That's a bummer to hear. A number of things can cause something like that to happen, but we are doing our best to make sure our infrastructure is running as great as it can.\n\nCan you please run this test: http://oce.leagueoflegends.com/tools/network-logs\n\nThen ship that info over to ocelivereports@riotgames.com so we can look into it. If you add \"for Cochese, from Godsmustbecrazy3 in the subject, I'll find it easier. (cool summoner name btw, I loved that movie)","replies":[]}]}]}
