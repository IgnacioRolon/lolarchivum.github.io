Unfortunately, this particular issue can&#039;t be mitigated by disabling a specific champion or item so we&#039;ve temporarily disabled Ranked while we develop a solution. We&#039;ll keep you updated with our progress as we continue triaging the issue.\n\n-Riot Cochese\n\n**UPDATE - 17/07/15, 11:11am AEST**\n\nWe have verified full functionality, and ranked queues, have been re-enabled in all regions. Thank you for your patience.\n\n**UPDATE - 17/07/15, 10:15am AEST**\n\nA fix has just passed our quality assurance tests and we are preparing a patch to fix the recall bug. You will not have a patch to download, we are able to fix this without patching to you. Once this is completed, we will re-enable Ranked and I'll post an update here. Thank you for your patience.","replies":[{"poster":"Riot Cochese","date":"2015-07-16T20:43:56.122+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"We've tested our fix against the majority of champions in the time since our last update .

The bug is still being investigated and then we will need to QA before patching out to everyone. Sorry for this, we are working as fast as we can to restore ranked.","replies":[{"poster":"Kraexy","date":"2015-07-16T07:18:01.318+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"any updates, i'm dying from lack of ranked.... norms have such a HUGE spread(im diamond i just played a norm with unranked and silvers, and master+couple other diamonds)","replies":[{"poster":"Riot Cochese","date":"2015-07-16T08:03:55.188+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Kraexy,realm=OCE,application-id=ElA0rvVL,discussion-id=wcE9G7o2,comment-id=000200000001,timestamp=2015-07-16T07:18:01.318+0000)\n>\n> any updates, i'm dying from lack of ranked.... norms have such a HUGE spread(im diamond i just played a norm with unranked and silvers, and master+couple other diamonds)\n\nThe only update is that I don't really have one yet.

I'd hope players aren't using this bug to gain unfair advantages in game, but describing it in detail, could hurt more than it helps.","replies":[]}]}]}
