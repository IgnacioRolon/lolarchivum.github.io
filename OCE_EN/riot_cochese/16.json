Your Mastery points are still being awarded and we are working to resolve the display issue.\r\n\r\nI will update with more info when we have it.\r\n\r\n-Riot Cochese","replies":[{"poster":"Riot Cochese","date":"2015-06-15T03:40:31.340+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Quick update - this fix will require a patch, which we try to avoid where possible. I know that patching is not the best option for us here in Oceania. With that, this issue does not affect all players, and is still functioning behind the scenes. (nobody is losing their progress)\n\nSo we are planning to hold on patching this fix out, unless there is another bug that is more critical. I'll keep you all posted once this is resolved.\n\nThank you,\nRiot Cochese","replies":[]},{"poster":"Riot Cochese","date":"2015-07-03T02:24:07.633+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Sorry for the late response here, this was fixed with the patch last week.","replies":[]},{"poster":"HORSE OF FORCE","date":"2015-06-12T07:31:27.644+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"I kinda like the circle which spins indefinitely.
