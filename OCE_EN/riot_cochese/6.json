I recently moved, and since then, I have had \"ok\" internet connectivity. I was averaging around 4mbs download, and .3mbs up. After restarting my modem, upgrading the firmware, verifying all my settings were correct and resetting my connection to the exchange. I found connection profile in my \"toolbox\" online. I was set at Standard, but there is a setting for \"Thrillseeker\" and \"Gamer\" as well. \n\nAfter changing my profile to Thrillseeker, I know get 7mbs down. I know this isn&#039;t great, but every mb helps and wanted to share this with anyone else that may benefit.\n\n**TL;DR - changing my iiNet connection profile (within the online toolbox) from \"Standard\" to \"Thrillseeker\" increased my download speed from 4mbs to 7mbs...woot.**\n\nBest,\nRiot Cochese","replies":[{"poster":"Bipolar","date":"2015-05-24T06:35:47.103+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":">7mbs down\n\nMeanwhile I get 500kbps.\n\nthank you telstra.","replies":[{"poster":"SupremeBaker","date":"2015-05-25T12:26:39.253+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You and me buddy.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Critterous","date":"2015-05-24T10:34:39.708+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Lol u think thats bad...\nIm just out of range of one of those internet towers or something\ni get a SOLID 250kb/s - 300kb/s\nit used to be about 80kb/s but we got some stuff sorted out","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Wumachine","date":"2015-05-24T13:59:12.774+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"wouldn't it be nice if we all had fibreeeeee (in tune of cadbury song)","replies":[]},{"poster":"kJs","date":"2015-05-24T02:45:58.947+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"Dat Coch do.\n\nty","replies":[]},{"poster":"amelianna","date":"2015-05-28T05:28:31.138+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Watch out for the occasional \"speed bump\". My modem used to restart on it's own where the speed would stay at 1mbps for a few days, and then restart itself again and be back to the usual 6.5. This happened so often that I rang support who put me back to standard and I haven't had the problem since. I'm happy with 5.5mbps and no speed bumps.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Magamis","date":"2015-05-26T05:40:00.361+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Optus is so shit atm... 200 kbs... fuck my life","replies":[]},{"poster":"Riot Cochese","date":"2015-05-24T23:23:36.190+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I wish I had fiber.

I was living off 3G for 5 years, I finally got ADSL and then I realize it's damn near obsolete these days, RIP.
