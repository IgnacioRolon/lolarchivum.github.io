My laptop is only 3 months old, alienware, all the latest updates, all the latest drivers, all optimized for gaming, all temperatures, cpu optimization, everything you could probably imagine, is in check. I have uninstalled the game, uninstalled patches, reinstalled everything ran as admin ect.\r\n\r\nThe game starts, you can NEVER predict it, some are earlier and thankfully meaningless but some are kind enough to be in the MIDDLE of a team fight.\r\n\r\nThe screen freezes, nothing can be clicked, no buttons do anything, SOUND CAN STILL BE HEARD from in game audio but no keys, do anything and the only way so far I can get out of it is to open and close the lid of the laptop or ctrl alt delete two times to restore control and animation to the game.\r\n\r\nIf anyone, has any idea what the hell this is or how to fix it, I will still donate a skin to you for just being helpful, I&#039;ve been dealing with this for months and it&#039;s affecting my ranked stats, please, do not hesitate to help, I will respond to any enquiries but please understand that it is confirmed to NOT BE THE FOLLOWING;\r\n\r\nGraphics Drivers (everything is absolutely latest possible)\r\nCPU temps, performance, ect (Everything has been optimized to Riots exact and optimal specifications)\r\n3rd Party Programs (I run, only, league when I play)\r\nInternet (It&#039;s ethernet wired, all internet tests submitted to Riot passed with flying colours)\r\n\r\nPlease, I&#039;m begging any of you, if you can help, any skin is yours without question.","replies":[{"poster":"Gehirn","date":"2016-02-23T00:32:34.115+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Also, the symptoms of the freeze (visual freeze, sound continues) and your workaround of closing/re-opening the screen or double ctrl-alt-del makes me immediately think that a background program is vying for attention.\nNormally when a program tries to bring itself \"to front\" it just pops up over any other window. If you're running league as a full screen app then it normally would minimize LoL but you'd still hear it in the background (my commercial anti-virus does this when it runs a scheduled scan).\n\nIn your case it sounds like some program is only \"half\" taking over, meaning you can still hear LoL running because it isn't frozen, but the game is not minimizing while also not essentially being \"displayed\", which is why it looks frozen.\n\n- I would try running LoL in windowed mode and see if you get the same issue. This might tell you more about the source of the problem when it occurs.\n\n- Also, try capping your frame rate to 140. An uncapped frame rate on high end PC's can cause issues such as game crashes or complete lock ups of your machine.","replies":[{"poster":"Revanchest","date":"2016-02-24T14:29:13.663+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Seems I somehow owe Rito a skin and a champion. Sorry I didn't reply for a few days, had some annoying shifts at work but nonetheless, 7 games played, no freezing.\n\nI did exactly as you specified and played it in windowed mode, however, my native resolution of 1920x1080 wouldn't let me move the cursor or the screen downards, just, upwards and to the sides, meaning I couldn't run to bot lane from red platform. I reduced the resolution by 2 more settings until it was on the 3rd highest, there I could play just fine.\n\nAlas, no freezing, at all, 10% jittery and I set the Frames as you suggested.\n\nWhat does this mean? and why have I been able to play for ages on native resolution but now got all these freezes that don't occur in lower resolution windowed mode? This is fantastic that it doesn't freeze but it seems to have left me with more questions.\n\nEither way, if you don't get back to this, truly, thank you, at least I can somewhat play normally again","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Deep Terror Nami","date":"2016-02-22T16:14:55.052+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey Revanchest,\n\nSometimes it's the *current* video driver that is the issue. If you suspect a driver problem but reinstalling doesn't work, you should try updating to a beta driver or rolling back to an older one also. \n\nMake sure Windows is completely up to date as well.\n\nOh, also, try disabling the Alienware Hivemind thing if you have it.\n\n-DTN","replies":[{"poster":"SephirothSG","date":"2016-02-22T17:35:08.556+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'd also recommend monitoring GPU temperatures during gameplay.
