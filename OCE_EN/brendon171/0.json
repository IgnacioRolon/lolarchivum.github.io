I was banned for 14 days in the past for being toxic saying racial slurs and all the rest which is 1000% understandable i was then un banned and have not been toxic since i just recently received a perm ban for being toxic when i wasn&#039;t saying anything that was out of line. one problem that i was a little curious about was saying i was being toxic by calling mid in a blind pick game. \r\n\r\nI was also typing to my friend through discord but i was using league to talk due to my mic charging. but i never said anything toxic to anyone on the team it was just banter between me and my friend so im a little confused on why i was banned considering it wasn&#039;t toxicity. To quote what i said &quot;dumb ass&quot; and &quot;u fucking ks me&quot;  but not talking to anyone but my friend on discord while he was laughing was just meming around and i dont see why i was banned and im really upset that i was banned. I put a ticket in to riot games and got a response from the bot but then replied asking for a human but how long does this process even take? i honestly just want to play the game","replies":[{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2018-12-22T12:50:30.819+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"If you want specific feedback from the boards community you'll have to post your whole logs, conjecture with so little to go on won't really get anyone anywhere.\n\nAs for support. First response is often a macro response (since they answer the vast majority of queries). They aren't bots, but they are mostly quick answers rather than comprehensive ones (since that's what most people want and need from support). Replying to the ticket will get you a completely custom one. Responses typically take under 24 hours, but given the holiday season things might be a bit slow. \n\nIt's worth noting that replying to the ticket or creating a new one before receiving a response will bump you back to the bottom of the queue, so unless you've heard nothing in a few days, avoid doing that.","replies":[]}]}
