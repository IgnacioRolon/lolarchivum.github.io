It seems the client was 'reset' as well, the beginner tips box that pops up in champ select etc popped up again. I had the 'Don't show this again' marked on it forever ago.\n\n_**BUG HAS BEEN FIXED**_","replies":[{"poster":"Hazzra","date":"2016-04-20T01:09:09.777+0000","up_votes":0,"down_votes":1,"body":"Yeah I had the same problem. Was going to play some ranked today, I logged in and it said i was in my placements, but below it said I had won 73 lost 58. I played a ranked game after this, which i lost :( but the problem seemed to go away for me after that. It put me back into my correct rank with the correct amount of LP. I think you just have to play a game of ranked for it to reset.","replies":[]}]}
