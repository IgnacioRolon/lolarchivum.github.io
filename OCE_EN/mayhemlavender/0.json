My client has no access to the Lunar Revel Shop **at all**. Posted multiple threads and comments on multiple boards. No help.\n\nThe thing is, if you think about it, why would Riot help a few individuals solves the problems? We are just a few potential customers to them; they've got more than thousands of RP spenders, no need to trouble with few rare cases happened to us.","replies":[{"poster":"Rumpdedum","date":"2016-01-31T13:41:50.951+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It's been three days since lunar shop stopped working and as you said i already posted the problem and got no replies at all. And just like you im starting to get angry. Bigger community shouldnt mean less problem solving. Riot has always been in communication with players more than any other game companies and now im just disappointed getting no reply and all on the issue. And I really dont know how to get someone to answer.","replies":[]}]}]}
