HOW COME I WAS PUNISHED?**](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/203066050-Tribunal-FAQ#h1q2)\n>\nSimply speaking, retaliation is not an acceptable or justifiable behavior. An argument between two players can easily create a negative experience for the rest players in the game with you. Regardless of the other playerâ€™s actions, this does not justify your own behavior. You alone are responsible for your actions within the game. If you encounter a toxic player like this, the best option is to simply report their behavior and move on.\n\nAlso, false reports do not hurt you. If you've done nothing wrong then their reports have no effect against you, and they'll even lose weight in their future reports. Ignore, mute, and report them instead of getting toxic and everything will be fine. Insulting someone never made them play better; it almost always makes them play worse and likely get toxic if they weren't already.\n\nIf you are entirely unable to do this, I'd suggest not creating a new account, or you'll just spend your time in it to get banned again.","replies":[]}]}
