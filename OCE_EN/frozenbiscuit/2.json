I went 2wins-3losses. Played a game right after and got back into promos. I was wondering, am I supposed to get a free win or not? I get free wins for my second time promos between divisions but it&#039;s been too long a while for me to know how it works when in second time tier promos. Does what I&#039;m asking make sense? lol","replies":[{"poster":"Tele","date":"2016-10-22T07:38:50.109+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey summoner,\n\nPromo Helper is limited to **below** Gold I only.
