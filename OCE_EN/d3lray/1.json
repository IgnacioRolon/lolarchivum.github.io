Have checked internet connection with Ookla and also modem settings/ status in browser, no problem with internet when not in-game (70 ping). \n\nMight be matchmaking system, because I don't normally get laggy normal games, instead aram games where not many people play. I would rather have to wait more than 5min for a 60 ping aram game, than a 150 ping piece of absolute munt. \n\nI am so sad, rito plz fix or I will either join ISIS or kill myself.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Mr Dunk yo girl","date":"2015-08-11T11:49:13.683+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"ive been getting serious lag spikes at peak times, i think its congestion? but its only been happening recently.","replies":[]}]}
