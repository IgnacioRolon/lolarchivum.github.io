Its un-predictable and making my life hell. Because Ill randomly crash on a game and ill get put in low priority. Normally i can get out of those 5 games without crashing again. Soon after however ill just get placed in low priority again and again. This is really making me pissed off. If anyone has a fix for all these crashes please PLEASE i beg you. Post it here","replies":[{"poster":"Mindstar","date":"2015-07-29T05:50:08.143+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey,\n\nWhat steps have you taken so far to try and isolate the issue?  For ideas, I'd start by checking out the support article on [Bug Splats and Game Crashes](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201761974-Bug-Splat-and-Game-Crashes) to start with, and see if something in that list fixes the issue for you.\n\nLet me know how you go.\n\nCheers!\nMindstar","replies":[{"poster":"Kappa Chameleon","date":"2015-08-07T12:35:55.205+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Everything ive tried hasnt fixed the problem. and i never had this problem. I havent changed my computer nothing has changed and i get it now. No one else seems to get it. Once in like every 10 games I get one game that just dosnt open. It will close straight away and say - \"An unknown DirectX error has occured and League of Legends cannot start. Please make sure your video card is using the latest video drivers from the manufacturer\" And if i click reconnect it will do it again and again. I have updated literally everything. Even my wireless adapter. Every fix ive found on the forums or on Youtube does not work. And the funny thing is if i just leave it and click connect when the games over (note- Not my fault i couldnt get in game) I can just click play and the next game will work. I really want to know why this is happening. Ive checked all the logs and its the same for everygame. And im literally just getting low priority after low priority and its really starting to demotivate me from playing the game. I fear my account will get banned and Im reluctant to play games.\n\n\nP.s- I have a friend who plays on this computer also but on a different account and she can keep playing games without a problem. I will not be playing league of legends until I know this is fixed.","replies":[{"poster":"Mindstar","date":"2015-08-17T05:50:25.605+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hi,\n\nThanks for the info.  I'd say your best bet here will be to get in touch with the support team via a ticket (if you haven't already) - they should be able to help you get to the bottom of the issue.\n\nMindstar","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Kappa Chameleon","date":"2015-08-16T14:15:31.829+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Bump","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Zedja","date":"2015-11-27T08:10:01.546+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"bump","replies":[]},{"poster":"Kappa Chameleon","date":"2015-08-16T14:14:30.423+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Bump.
