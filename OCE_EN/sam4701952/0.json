Admittedly i am stuck in low elo and i do encounter alot of afkers some are on the other team and no its not fair that they have to lose a game they couldve won a 5v5 with. i think this is something that needs to be addressed not just in low elos but also in higher elos.","replies":[{"poster":"CHEESYLEEKS","date":"2016-03-31T21:29:40.700+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"hey guys i dont think we can win ill go afk and we wont lose any lp. it could easily be abused\n\njust dont give up as you might just win\n\nhttp://i1190.photobucket.com/albums/z459/Tom_Smoodger/saddad_zpsufxy7iie.jpg","replies":[{"poster":"Essembie","date":"2016-03-31T22:01:42.982+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"http://images1.tickld.com/live/postimages/108d4df245dbe51e9f588cfe46008e8f.gif","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Roguestoney","date":"2016-03-31T19:10:00.979+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Nope no loss prevented.
