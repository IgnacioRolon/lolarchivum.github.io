After I noticed the lag, I pinged my router (192.168.0.1) and noticed the exact same fluctuating pings (from 2-300ms, as opposed to 39-350ish ms during a game of LoL). After doing all sorts of tests and fixes from the basic resetting router/adapters to flushing dns changing bands and everything else, what worked for me was using cmd to run the command 'netsh int ip reset reset.log hit' to reset TCP/IP. Upon restarting, all other applications and pinging cmd shows perfectly normal ping. HOWEVER, the problem is when I start LOADING (while I had ping 192.168.0.1 -t running in the background), the ping spikes RETURNED IMMEDIATELY, and the only fix was the same TCP/IP reset. \n\nI'm not very savvy with my networking, so I'm not too sure what the actual problem is, but I am pretty certain the cause is with League's new update, as it does not happen on any other computer on my net, and it only affects the transmission from my computer to the router. After applying the TCP/IP reset, the problem goes away until a LoL game is loaded, and then the problem remains until another reset is applied (other methods like resetting adaptor and the router don't change anything).\n\nCan someone else please confirm their problem is the same, \n\nIf anyone wants to follow the steps I took:\n\nSTEP 1:     run command prompt -> ping (your router IP, commonly 192.168.0.1) -t\nThis will keep pinging your router and you can watch for fluctuations which I saw in mine. If there is, continue.\nSTEP 2:     run command prompt again AS ADMINISTRATOR -> netsh int ip reset reset.log hit \nType this in and hit enter. It should attempt resetting a few things.\nSTEP 3:     restart computer\nNow  ping the router again (STEP 1). It should be back to normal. Keep it running and start a game of LoL, if the ping starts bouncing around again then we got the same problem. Run STEP 2 to fix for other games/programs.\n\nRiot please investigate!","replies":[]},{"poster":"Rok","date":"2015-12-09T06:41:04.026+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Ive been getting ping increases of 50-90ms for the last few days / since 5.24.\nNormally my ping is 30ms but its been a constant 80-120ms. \nMy net went down a few days ago and our routers config was reset but ive since (i thought) fixed it. This morning i thought i had fixed it after changing a few settings from the day before and it ended up going back to 30ms and CS:GO was also back to normal. But now its back up on the same day. I tested it around 10am so i know its not on/off peak.

Im with Westnet/IINet too so it may be a problem with the ISP? \n\nI'd attach a dxdiag but...","replies":[]},{"poster":"CharLe3","date":"2015-12-07T10:41:29.040+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"IINET users have bad routing problems.
