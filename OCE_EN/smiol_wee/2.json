I thought to do this especially when Rengar activated his R.  From outside the radius of which we can see Rengar in ult camo (which is larger than he can see into wraith form), he can still jump to the characters who have been turned into Wraiths. \r\nI find a problem with this seeing as Senna's Description states that allies are camouflaged **_AND_** also appear as wraiths, claiming that \"Wraiths gain movement speed, are unselectable and hide their identities\" which means that although they should get the mark over their head and have the vision around them when effected by Rengar's ult, he shouldn't be able to jump to them unless he's close enough to see through the wraith forms. My thought was that could be a cool form of counterplay. Seeing as nothing else really stops him from jumping 10 times a second out of bushes anyway so even though as a melee with gap closers he already has the upper hand against her it'd be nice to be able to play around with some counterplay. But regardless he just jumps out of nowhere and just kills you... because counterplay.","replies":[{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2019-11-18T11:48:31.154+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> Rengar gains 40% movement speed and **true sight of the nearest enemy champion** (within 2500 range) for 12 seconds.","replies":[{"poster":"Lord Sesshomaru","date":"2019-11-19T01:45:27.757+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Actually I think OP has a point here.\nRengar’s ult indeed grants true sight.  But Senna’s official tooltip states:\n\n> Allies who enter the area are camouflaged **and also** appear as wraiths as the Mist shrouds them. Wraiths gain increased movement speed, are unselectable, and hide their identities.\n\nThe wording here clearly indicates that while occurring simultaneously, the wraith state is a separate effect from the camouflage.  The wraith effect itself is stated as:\n\n> Wraiths gain {{ totalms }} Movement Speed. They are unselectable and hide their identities as long as no enemy champions are nearby.\n\nSo while true sight will give Rengar eyes on the champion through the camouflage.  The ‘unselectable’ state is part of the wraith effect and thus separate from the camouflage.  Meaning he still shouldn’t be able to click on them to jump to the wraithed champion even though he can see them.\n\nEither the current interaction is wrong, or the wording is.  So OP’s point here is still valid even though Rengar has true sight.  In my eyes at least.","replies":[{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2019-11-19T12:06:37.411+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The true sight effect is stated to \"reveal all stealthed units\", and whether you consider it separate or together with the camo, the wraith is still a form of stealth and thus would logically be revealed by a true sight effect within range.\n\nThe *only* effect that overpowers true sight is nearsightedness (you still have true sight within the near-sight range, but not outside of it).","replies":[{"poster":"Lord Sesshomaru","date":"2019-11-19T13:36:40.485+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"That's a valid point, for arguments sake lets say the 'disguised' is a form of stealth, then target would be revealed in their true form, but the wraiths are stated to have 3 effects: _'**Disguised**, **unselectable**, and **increased MS**.'_  Being seen doesn't remove ALL wraith bonuses, as we know the MS is still kept.  Therefore the target in theory should be revealed and undisguised, but still unselectable.\n\n_**However**_, if we are to agree that 'hiding the identity of the champion' is considered 'stealth' then by definition true sight should also reveal Neeko in her passive.\n\nI'm not arguing what I think the ideal interaction is, I'm just saying what I interpret the tooltip to be indicating.\n\nThe tooltips often tie themselves in knots, they really need more thought going into writing these things.\n\nIn truth, personally I think that Senna has more than enough utility already, so the current interaction isn't a huge loss at all _(although in saying that, having a support that can offer some relative safety against Rengar would be nice too. But perhaps it'd be better on someone more specialised for that purpose.)_.","replies":[{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2019-11-20T01:32:55.249+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I would argue the unselectable is a result of the stealth and therefore it makes sense to be revealed by true-sight.\n\nAs for Neeko's passive, given that you can technically still see her, I guess true sight doesn't interpret that as stealth, but the same could be said for Senna's wraiths (you can't tell who they are or what health they are on, but you still know their position. The only difference is the targeting). I understand why they interact the way they do though from a balance perspective. \n\nPerhaps instead of revealing a wraith completely they simply become targetable and their max health bars are revealed, but the actual identity of the champion and their current health remain obscured (much like Neeko).","replies":[{"poster":"Lord Sesshomaru","date":"2019-11-21T22:53:55.437+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yeah that could be the defining difference between Neeko and the wraiths, that you can still see her.\nAlthough now that you mention health bars, that's probably a fundamental difference too, Neeko's health bar is not shrouded like the wraiths.  I didn't think about that.  That vastly contributes to 'stealth'.\n\nOh from a balance perspective its totally understandable!  I am only arguing semantics haha \n\n> Perhaps instead of revealing a wraith completely they simply become targetable and their max health bars are revealed, but the actual identity of the champion and their current health remain obscured (much like Neeko).\n\nYeah this could be a good solution that satisfies both parties!  Senna maintains some utility while Rengar and others aren't rendered completely redundant.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]}]}
