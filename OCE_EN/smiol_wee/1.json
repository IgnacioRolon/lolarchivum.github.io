I was playing with my friend who has level 7 with Kindred and he was convinced that my score was going to be an S, however it was only A+. Now the only thing we can think of is that I was marked down for farm but even still shouldn&#039;t that have been worth an S- then? I&#039;m not level 5 with her so its not a big problem for me now but I just cant believe that its harder than that to get an S as Kindred jungle.
