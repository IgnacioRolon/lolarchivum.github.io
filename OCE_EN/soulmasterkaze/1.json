Any rank will do as long as players are receptive to advice and generally willing to learn.  This does *not* mean that I'll be ordering anyone around.\r\n\r\nI have a generally good knowledge about all aspects of the game, and I'm good at explaining complex concepts in an easily-understandable format.\r\n\r\nThe mode of delivery will probably be online, but I'd be willing to come to Melbourne for meetings with teams.\r\n\r\nSuccessful applicants will have their team matches watched and analysed by me, and I'd also like to listen to your comms to see any good points or deficiencies, and giving constructive solutions to any shortcomings.\r\n\r\nThanks for reading, hope to hear from you soon.","replies":[]}
