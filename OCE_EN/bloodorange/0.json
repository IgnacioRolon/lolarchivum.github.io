It's not like we need to pay a subscription service to play League, and all money we do pay them is only to convert our currency into a format usable by the game for aesthetic enhancements, not even related to game-play.\n---\nThe rest of what you said is pretty much spot on, though.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Zximo","date":"2015-03-18T10:56:54.934+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"dude last riot reply was 2 hours ago","replies":[{"poster":"HORSE OF FORCE","date":"2015-03-20T09:32:10.901+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"That's still a bit... ergh.

We pay for an in game currency. All of LoL apart from the store could be down 24/7 and you would have no financial recourse because you can still use the currency.","replies":[]}]}
