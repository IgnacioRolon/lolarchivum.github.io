Whenever i play league i get over 500 ping with the average of about 1000 (highest though is 6134 but that was only a spike) and this is constant through out the game. it makes me reconnect and disconnect for ages and its unplayable. when i do get a miracle and i get about 50 ping i go and farm and boom goes back to 500-1000 and my champion stops moving and the other player or bot kills me. funny thing however is that i can still see all of my team mates moving and im just sitting there. ALSO another interesting thing is that when i play a game like TF2 or Gmod the ping is fine and i can have fun.....but what really pisses me off is that im tempted to leave the game so i can end the hell for both me and my team but i recently got leaver buster and had a lower priority que of 20 mins as i \"disconnected\" from the game too much. so i have to stay in the game and TRY to move my champion around so i dont get kicked :(  if you took the time to read this i hope you understand my position and i thank you for bearing with me and if you ever play against me or get teamed up with me please understand that i am not a toxic player.","replies":[{"poster":"HORSE OF FORCE","date":"2015-01-07T06:07:12.585+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"What's your ISP?

Over 500 ping is normal to you?
