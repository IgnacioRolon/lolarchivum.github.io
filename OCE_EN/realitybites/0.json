How has something not been addressed in the last few seasons to do ANYTHING about this.\r\n\r\nLeavebuster is great and punishes repeat offenders, but even in random DC's these people do not deserve a punishment, the other players need a solution.\r\n\r\nRiot, maybe stop churning out cash driving events and focus on fixing your game play.","replies":[{"poster":"Slim Chaedi","date":"2015-01-26T06:57:43.414+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"People argue that it balances out with enemies lso getting DCs, but I would much rather a game where no team is impacted by DCs and games are won on elements of the game, 100% of the time.","replies":[{"poster":"Realitybites","date":"2015-01-26T07:00:19.411+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Exactly this.\n\nMake it so the players affected (same team as the DC) do not suffer a placement loss or a stagnate LP loss and the team that is unaffected gains half the LP.\n\nObviously tweaks to timing and things need to be worked out to prevent abuse however it seems silly that after so many years this has not been fixed.","replies":[{"poster":"Slim Chaedi","date":"2015-01-26T08:01:43.708+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Realitybites,realm=OCE,application-id=FjGAIbRv,discussion-id=vEGAsXch,comment-id=00000000,timestamp=2015-01-26T07:00:19.411+0000)\n>\n> Exactly this.\n> \n> Make it so the players affected (same team as the DC) do not suffer a placement loss or a stagnate LP loss and the team that is unaffected gains half the LP.\n> \n> Obviously tweaks to timing and things need to be worked out to prevent abuse however it seems silly that after so many years this has not been fixed.\n\nThe main abuse I can see happening is if someone duos and their partner leaves for them. However, I would assume the partner who left would expect that in return sometime? Also, just don't have this for ranked teams. If duos abusing it is a problem then that can be easily solved, by getting rid of the ability for it to be exploited.\nI have won games because people have DCs. I play this game because it is competitive, and that is where the fun in the game is. If people leave the game isn't something you really need to compete for to win anymore, and that ruins both the fun and the integrity of the league system.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Devil God King","date":"2015-01-29T03:35:35.467+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"they need to stop DELAYING AND INHIBITING PROGRESS OF THE FREE MARKET AND MONEY INTO THE COMPANIES HANDS. leaver penalities should be removed asap. this is what is best for the community.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Ing√©nue","date":"2015-01-26T07:28:48.721+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Leaver buster is live. It hands out incredibly hard punishments whether the DC is intentional or not (no naming and shaming, it is against forum rules).\n\nI would love for you to come up with a system for ranked play that is not easily abused. \nOne thing that has been suggested is loss prevented for 4v5 (qq, I'm gonna lose why not afk or bully someone else to the point of afk), also punishing the people on the enemy team who put effort into the match only to get no rewards.","replies":[]}]}
