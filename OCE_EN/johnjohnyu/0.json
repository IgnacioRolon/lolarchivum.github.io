Now that the notice is being removed and also have another Red Tracker mentioning it should be up, but yet still unable to transfer.\r\n\r\nEvery restart after transferring, I can log in back to NA with the same amount of RP as if nothing happens, opened a ticket and support team said there seems to be a problem and just straight close my ticket without me being able to reply back.\r\n\r\nSO WHEN IT CAN BE FIXED??? If this is what going to happen for a long period of time, i rather just be done with it as a long time player from Season 1.","replies":[{"poster":"kamkam1990","date":"2018-11-11T12:32:55.130+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yeah, my friend tried transferring hes BR account to OCE since he is studying in Australia now and it did the exact same thing as you're experiencing he told me.

I just got my account back after a long hiatus, and playing on 200 ping is painful.
