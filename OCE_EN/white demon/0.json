I mean not only do you gain nothing for winning most of the time you also lose it all in pretty much 1 game. I mean i played about 6-7 games tonight and won 5. After 2 loses i am back to 0 LP. Keep in mind im bronze for godsakes. The amount of trolls and AFK people there is just annoying. I have seen some post about how it shows if your worthy to rank up. Sure i understand that but making someone win 3 games and lose every thing you earned in 1 is bullshit to say the least. \r\n\r\nCant there be a way to help people with an afk? or a DC. Like lower the amount of LP lost if someone is DC at the end of the game? Most of the community is shit and you find a lot of people just waiting to find someone who they can ruin their game and make them lose them LP. Its pathetic and needs to be fixed. Either remove the annoying assholes out of the game or simple just put something in there to help the people who have to deal with shit behavior all the time. The game is getting unplayable if your just gonna have a troll everytime. What the point in playing?\r\n\r\n(Ignore Grammar and stuff very late. Very annoyed. Sick and tired of this shit.)","replies":[]}
