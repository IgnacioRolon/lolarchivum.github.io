I understand it was strong and you needed to lower that, but why take him away completely. If you bring him back, you can just lower his AP stats. At the moment, he cannot be played AP at all. Please can you have a look at this as this was one of my favourite things to play and by taking it away you kind of ruined it for me. \r\n\r\nThanks\r\nChaseGaming NZ","replies":[{"poster":"KingDinger","date":"2015-02-24T04:53:19.983+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"AD yi IS AP yi now...\n\nthere isnt anything different from the current AD yi to old AP yi...oh wait yes there is, he does more damage when auto attacking.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Knuuckles","date":"2015-02-24T01:37:21.837+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"a single scaling ap skill, with high cooldown with lowered stats.....................\nthink about it","replies":[]}]}
