I knew the chances were slim of working, but the person who responded advised me to repost here. &quot;Recently, it is becoming more apparent that twitch is a seriously unbalanced and unfair platform to many content creators, a lot of which are league of legends content creators. The very loosely enforced rules by the Twitch staff are creating a bias towards certain streamers based on attribute such as gender or sexual appeal, despite this being the opposite of what is stated in their community rules. On the other hand, streamers that are ordinary content creators who may make a small mistake receive bans. While it is true that they do deserve bans, the female streamers who do the same thing if not worse receive no such punishment due to their sexuality. An example can be seen with what was done with streamer Trainwreck at minute 5:27 of this video https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvFfAWFrAQI. The twitch staff have already refused to respond to any effort by the community to point out these discrepancies, but one way to receive a response from twitch is through a major corporation that uses the site such as you guys, RiotGames. By &quot;threatening&quot; to potentially revoke some competitive streams and move to youtube for example, or some other more appropriate measure,we can force twitch to make changes to their corrupt and money hungry platform and make it a better place for not only league of legends content creators and fans, but for all twitch users. I really hope somebody will give this ticket some serious consideration and im sure many people from the League community feel the same way as I do.&quot; So u guys, can we think of a way we can stop this Twitch bias and create a friendlier twitch AND league community? \r\nTL;DR Twitch is being biased to females and this is effecting all streamers including growing league of legends streamers and we should ome up with ways of saving our community.","replies":[{"poster":"Fitzky","date":"2017-11-16T10:47:16.666+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"YouTube would be the better option if it wasn't so shit towards streaming.","replies":[{"poster":"Caelestia","date":"2017-11-16T11:26:51.547+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I agree.
