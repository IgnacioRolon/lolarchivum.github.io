I know it sucks to lose a game because of AFKS, but assuming you don't afk, the enemy has a higher chance of an afk then you do. Hopefully you don't get any AFKS and have a great day.\n\nYours sincerely, \nTalwyn","replies":[]},{"poster":"andyMak","date":"2016-03-18T04:46:43.029+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"people would feel like its a loss early into game and afk to lose less points","replies":[]},{"poster":"Vanilla Bread","date":"2016-03-18T03:56:12.452+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"nah, If that was possible i would be afk 80% of my games","replies":[]},{"poster":"Hailwood","date":"2016-03-23T04:36:14.911+0000","up_votes":0,"down_votes":0,"body":"I probably should have mentioned that the afk should lose full LP, and potentially to avoid teams coming in with dummy accounts to afk with, anyone queued with the afk would also lose full LP.","replies":[]}]}
