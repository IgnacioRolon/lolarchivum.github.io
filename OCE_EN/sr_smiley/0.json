Let me know if you like/dislike it and why.\r\n\r\nLet me know if you can figure out what skin universe it is in (maybe hard), and the two existing champions featured in this story (easy). Let&#039;s begin.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAs we lay scattered throughout the area in our thousands each one waiting for food to be delivered,  a beast arrived carrying our next meal. Yet another combination of metal and flesh is laid down on the soft, decaying ground as the beast drops our feed.\r\n\r\n_food                    flesh                danger                                        feast            beware\r\n                  ripe?    perhaps                                           hide            patient\r\n_\r\n\r\nWe hide patiently while the beast takes one cautious look around and leaves, it wears material over its mouth making it a difficult torch to ignite. It isn&rsquo;t one of our lanterns yet.\r\n\r\nOnce the creature is out of sight we sweat from the soil to form the shape of the beast that left. First a head rises from our mass which pulls up our torso, followed by my two arms and a pair of legs as I move toward my meal. We begin by gliding over the ground toward the platter before placing one foot in front of the other as I start to walk towards the corpse.\r\n\r\n_Oh what cruel mistress death is to have taken you from me before I could have seen you alight with my own eyes. You are another beautiful frame that could have carried a truly bright flame forth through this land, sharing a part of me with the world if only you could have sought me before this day.\r\n_\r\n\r\nThe apparatus protruding from his back begins to stir as I realise that he may not be dead for long. His body writhes and contorts as bones break and sinews snap before healing with a faint alchemical glow.\r\n\r\nI reach my black, writhing hand down to his cheek and stroke it gingerly, bending my torso forwards only when I realise how absurd it must look to others seeing my arm stretch like that. I must strive to blend in, at least at a glance. It is time to ignite another flame inside this empty vessel.\r\n\r\nOne to light the flame, another to control it.\r\n\r\nMy thumb and forefinger detach and slither into his mouth as he changes. One of us head towards his brain, the other toward his heart.\r\n\r\nWe do not get to feed yet, but a flame will bring us food should we need it. We need to just wait here in the Sump.\r\n\r\nOur mind reaches out to the many lanterns we have ignited through the area. We see a thousand nearby fires of many different sizes blazing along the sides of the nearby streets and in the buildings around us.\r\n\r\nWe need not bother those who have travelled beyond Zaun yet, we ask those nearby for news. \r\n\r\nWe are told that five of those who would douse our flames have arrived.\r\n\r\n_We must be cautious now. We are almost ready, haste would make waste of this lovely place and that simply won&rsquo;t do. Our new flame shines bright, only a few more and we will be ready._\r\n\r\nI take a step back, then another as my form melts and we seep into the area around where we had formed, waiting for our next meal to be delivered by the next beast.\r\n\r\n_                         hide                            disperse                                hush                            patient\r\n     moist                        earth                        quiet           \r\n                                                    soon_","replies":[]}
