In a decent number of my games as Rek&#039;sai, I&#039;ve got fed and managed to help out every lane by ganking. My problem is, no matter how many times I get a lead and help my team, the enemy team always manages to end up beating my team. I&#039;ve noticed with Rek&#039;sai that a lot of her strength comes from the early game and as she drops off in the late game, she becomes more reliant on her team. \r\n\r\nDoes this mean that me picking Rek&#039;sai makes me a detriment to the team? Is it purely because the champion that I enjoy playing isn&#039;t suited to low elo and therefore gives me a low winrate?\r\n\r\nI really want to refrain from flaming my team and saying my team is shit, but sometimes I can&#039;t help but think &quot;I have done everything I possibly could have to help my team, so why are we still losing?&quot;. Because of this I often get the feeling that me winning is out of my control and entirely based on my team.\r\n\r\nIs there some kind of skill I&#039;m lacking? I&#039;m not sure if I have poor map awareness or poor decision making. \r\n\r\nI often get this psychological feeling that my team is doing well after a number of successful ganks in the early game, only to see the enemy team start winning what looks like a macro game in the mid/late game. \r\n\r\nSo can someone please tell me what it is I&#039;m doing wrong? And please don&#039;t give me the childishly toxic reply like &quot;You suck, you&#039;ll derank to wood 5&quot;. I&#039;m actually looking for help in this post to see if someone with more experience in ranked to give me tips. \r\n\r\nThanks for reading","replies":[{"poster":"lukic","date":"2018-04-01T18:41:53.431+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"if you are really reliant on your team then you shouldn’t be building damage in the first place, build full tank and items like locket. Don’t just main champions it doesn’t make u better at the game people main and abuse champions only to gain elo, be diverse and play whatever champion your team requires. People don’t realise this but league of legends is a game decided based on champ select the champions you choose can be a win or loss and this isn’t counting your outliers. I don’t wanna hear about oh this is bronze you can play whatever you want, no you can’t lol if your team has no cc or no tank you are picking that Zac that Sejuani and no you aren’t building AP or AD you build peeling items and tanky items. I haven’t watched any of your games but to be a successful jungler you don’t need to gank but control the game. Invade the enemy jungler take his farm get a exp lead, take objectives and buy pink wards trust me buying a pink as a jungler is huge, warding for your horrible teammates could stop them from dying to jungle ganks. It is important to op.gg your opponent and your team to check if they are titled and who you think is going to be good such as are they playing a champion they are good at or are they off role. Don’t camp the off role top camp your adc and support main at bot, buy pink wards for them so they can carry you. Do barons, just by looking at your games I feel like you don’t know how to push leads if you are really ahead you need to group early and force objectives so the enemy team is forced to fight you or lose baron, tower etc. When I’ve played in bronze baron is somehow always free. Communicate with your team in my games I ping a lot and I mean a lot, a lot of my low elo friends rarely ping at all and never comminicate with their team it’s vital in winning games since it is a team game after all the team that works better together always wins regardless of how far behind you are. Good luck and if all else fails try playing another role and see how you go lots of people have switched roles and gotten high elo but it’ll take time and practice to adjust so keep that in mind.","replies":[{"poster":"Axylum","date":"2018-04-02T08:44:20.595+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yeah you're right. I very often get leads in my games but I have 0 idea of how to use them to my advantage. The only reason I played rek'sai often is because I'm very consistent when playing her. I understand all of her mechanics and play her to the best of my ability. \n\nI often do buy pink wards (control wards), but I always place them at my buffs rather than my lanes. This is probably because I didn't op.gg my teammates to see who is maining a particular lane and has the best ability to push their lead that I could give them.\n\nBaron nashor is one objective I have no idea how to play around. When is it safe to take baron? Are we able to take baron? Are we able to steal baron? Should we take baron or their turret/inhibitor? Should we take baron when their team is alive or dead? \nThis kind of decision making around Baron is something I'm especially bad at as a player in general. But I guess it means more when I'm the jungler since I'm the one with smite. \n\nYour point about pings is contrary is my experience in bronze ranked. I see HEAPS of pings, but it seems the people receiving the pings do not notice them, especially the \"Mid laner is missing ping\".\n\nYeah, I should switch my roles around. Back when I played norms only, I was almost always the filler. So I do have at least some experience in every role. (Personally, I dislike adc the most)\n\nThanks for the tips Lukic","replies":[{"poster":"lukic","date":"2018-04-03T03:52:21.624+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"For baron calls pretty much if your team is let’s say mid lane and you see their adc farming at bot just rush baron but your team needs to all be on the same page if one person doesn’t come you can’t do it. If you ace them and you have a wave at mid you go for towers instead if you don’t have a minion wave go baron.

I would suggest picking champions that scale well into the late game that don't have a horrible early/mid. Shyvanna, Sej, Kha'Zix, Jax, are my personal recommendations. If you think you actually deserve to be higher mmr than what you are then you can always play yi and ww and just noobstomp your way up, but doing so can stunt your growth as a player and you should expect large losing streaks after winning a lot. \n\nI would just suggest learning the game better and get a more thorough understanding of it before worrying about champions. It's pretty easy to get out of bronze doing whatever you want as long as you're good enough to do it.  There a good chance you are severely lacking knowledge of match ups and are just doing the same strategies over and over hoping they'll work. You need to be able to adapt every minute of the game and identify what the next step should be in order to win. What turrets are up and how does that effect my jungle pathing? Who is fed? Who should i gank for? Can i effectively gank this person? What are their summoner spells and do they have them off cd? When is dragon spawning? Can i take herald uncontested? Should i group? Should i split? There are a bunch of decisions to be made outside of just trying to kill the enemy and those are probably the main factors holding you back. Kills will come from good decision making, not the other way around. \n\nOf course league is a team game. But any champion that can get ahead enough from good play will be able to well enough in team fights and skirmishes to make the game easier on their team. Remember that your team is just as good as the enemy team, if you can make the game easy enough for your team there is a good chance your team can beat the enemy.","replies":[{"poster":"Axylum","date":"2018-04-02T08:58:09.048+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yeah, I slowly started realising that rek'sai is a strong early game champion who is much better at winning games in shorter times (no wonder why that challenger rek'sai main I saw was doing so well). It must just be that some champions are simply better in higher elo than lower elo, and I think Rek'sai is one of the champions. So for now, I'll be switching over to my other main Kha'zix, who I mained back in season 7\n\nI have barely played any khazix in ranked, but in the few games I have. I was doing significantly better. \n\nThe reason why I was worrying about champions is because I don't want to pick one mechanically skilled demanding champion and then play a game and fail a combo/skillshot and end up losing lane because of that. \nThis is why I pick mechanically easier champions such as rek'sai and kha'zix. I can worry less about my own mechanics and focus on my other skills such as map awareness and decision making (by far my worst 2 skills).\n\nAnother thing I'm concerned about is teamfighting. I often play champions that are only good at skirmishing or 1v1 duels such as irelia, kha'zix and rek'sai. But when it comes to teamfighting, more than half the time I feel like my team pick really bad engages and it psychologically affects me from joining in to help them. So when I leave the teamfight either unscathed or really low on hp, someone just HAS to spam ????? pings at me like a fking retard trying to tilt his own team.\n\nAbout matchups, I think I have pretty decent game knowledge on what champions have what's in their kit and their builds. I often go onto the league wikia to read up on champion skills and such to gain an understanding of them before fighting them. \n\nJungle pathing is one thing I haven't put too much thought into. My first clear is simply, buff- wolves- buff, then decide scuttle or gank top/bot or mid, or invade enemy jungle. Usually after that, I back and buy my smite item and maybe something else like boots.\nBut that is pretty much my early pathing in a nutshell. I've never thought to do anything too different since this pathing seems to work for me most of the time.\n\nI forgot to mention another thing about my decision making. Sometimes I'm in another lane just taking a big minion wave to farm and stop a push, whilst somewhere else on the map, a teamfight happens. I don't have TP, and I'm about to push into the enemy tower. So should I continue split pushing? or go help my team, where by the time I get there the teamfight outcome should have already been decided? \nI've tried experimenting with this type of situation, and often times, whenever I stay to farm and split push, my team flames me for not helping in teamfight and proceeds to spam ????? pings.\n\nbut again, thanks for the tips,\nI really should be adapting to the situation more often. I mean come on, even my own champion, Kha'zix, is constantly talking about it.\n\nEdit: Excuse my poor grammar. A lot of these words sounded better in my head :/","replies":[{"poster":"Socon","date":"2018-04-02T12:14:00.563+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Kha zix is more mechanically demanding than you realise, especially late game. You need to be close to the team and be looking to make picks and ways to assassinate squishies and resetting your e and procing your passive with r. E -> Q mid air -> land buffer w -> autoproc passive -> If they're not dead you can press r and auto proc passive into Q -> And or just E away once they are dead since you should have got the reset by then. \n\nPlaying 'duelist' champions in teamfights is viable but you have to change you playstyle around. Meaning you need to be aware of what abilities are being used. If the malz still has ult, trying to jump onto the caitlyn will probably equal death. Often times when playing an assassin you have to wait for the fight to be well in and fought before going in to kill everyone, but you should always be ready to jump in. If you're not strong enough to get picks i would suggest staying near your mage or adc (whoever is more fed) and dealing damage out to whoever gets close.\n\nAs for jungle pathing, you do have room for diversity. Buff-wolf-buff-gank is pretty standard but if you don't have the ability to gank the enemy you can always do gromp-scuttle-enemy krug for a level 4 first back. After that i would suggest heading to your own krugs and working towards a full clear while looking for ganks and heading to whatever lane needs you. If bot lane has gotten some early kills it is possible to do a level 4 dragon with some assistance, if you are playing someone like ww then you can solo it. Ideally you want to have the area scyered for wards and stuff before doing it. \n\nIn terms of decision making, junglers should almost never split push unless that is what the champion is designed to do. If there is a large wave your team cant take then clear it as fast as possible and immediately head towards your team. YOur team shouldn't be looking for conflict when there are large waves pushing turrets in the first place but it happens. If you're someone like Yi however then you can split push if you see yourself getting a tower or more, but its almost always just a good idea to clear the wave then get back to your team asap. Even if they fight is mostly over you can still maybe get afew clean up kills or maybe help some surviving members of your team. Obviously, if everyone is already dead or out of the fight then you probably weren't going to make it in time anyway and the game could be over at that point.\n\nHope this helps.","replies":[{"poster":"Axylum","date":"2018-04-03T04:47:59.471+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"This really does help, tyvm! :)\n\nYou've provided many tips for the areas I'm weakest in. \n\nYeah you're right, I think I'm a good kha'zix player but when it comes to teamfighting and decision making in teamfights, during the late game, I find myself doing very poorly. One game, there was a kassadin who kept going into the front, so I was baited into thinking it was an easy kill. I was demoralized from assassinating their tristana (who was also a threat) because she had GA. So in the score screen chat, kasssadin mentioned how my decision to kill kassadin was a mistake when I should have been trying to kill tristana. Forgot to mention, the rest of their team were tanks.\nSo playing that game makes me ask myself \"What do I do against my targets when they build GA?\"\n\nJust as you talk about how the first clear can be diversified, I did exactly what you said before reading this post. I went buff>wolf>buff then without possible ganks I went gromp-scuttle-enemy krugs. This really helps me out so that I don't fall behind (Which is especially important if I'm playing kha'zix).\n\nAnd thank you so much again for your last paragraph. This is the situation where my decision making usually results in me getting ????? ping spammed. But for clearing those large waves, should I consider getting Ravenous Hydra? I find that kha'zix has pretty poor wave clear if I don't land a good W aoe. \nAbout getting back to the team, I'm pretty confident I can get there in a short time given that I usually get mobility boots (not sure if getting mobi boots a good idea) and the Relentless hunter rune. I also evolve R most of the time for my last evolution (Also not sure if this is a good idea).\n\nAnd about the teamfighting whilst there are larges waves. Is it really my fault that the team gets into a teamfight whilst I'm clearing a large minion wave and farming up? I personally feel as if this is the sort of thing that only happens in low elo, where people are constantly thinking about fighting and no other 'objectives' such as farming.","replies":[{"poster":"Socon","date":"2018-04-03T07:58:39.923+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"For Kha'Zix it can be ok to get mobi and relentless hunter but only if you're actually going to use that mobility to act on decisions fast and succeed. Personally i like going electrocute,sudden impact, relentless hunter, transcendence, waterwalking, then I can build ionian boots if im ahead. Any excess CDR will turn into damage because of transcendence wich is easy to do on ad assassins. I like to evolve R first so i can stealth in bushes and proc my passive more which is a large source of damage early game. Then depending on the team I either get my w or e (if they are tanky i like to get my w so i can kite them since i wont be getting kills to reset my e [because they're tanks]) Then last I get whatever I feel like if they were tanky id get q for a faster cd so i can do dps to them (R-W-Q) Or if they're squishy and i know i can get kills then i get e (R-Q/W-E). W is good if you need the wave clear you were talking about. \n\nI will reiterate my last pont. If there is a giant minion wave about to hit your turret your team shouldn't be engaging. These kinds of waves are important to farm for gold and exp in order to keep up. During the late game however you can ignore them for something like an inhib or baron or elder dragon. That said, if it is mid game and your team wants to put themselves at a deficit for not getting the large minion wave then thats on them, however do not stay to farm the minions after you catch the large wave, you should group if possible. In low mmr i would say however all that really matters is just roflstomp killing everyone because they're bad at the game. \n\nWhen it comes to targets with GA I would say stay close to your team and help them kite the enemy front line until you see an opening to pop the adc's ga and living. If you stay grouped the enemy will just focus on diving your front line and thats the best time to dive their back line. The part about kassadin is possibly right, a good kassadin player wont die to a single assassin because they have flash on a 2 second cooldown.  Kassadin needs to be close to do damage because he is also an assassin, so you could always stay next to your adc and blow him up when he decides to jump on them. Whats good and bad to do changes every second when you are team fighting so you need to be quick to identify whats going on. Often times it is teamfighting that seperates challenger soloq players and pro players. (As well as more controlled macro).\n\nItems on kha are pretty standard; warrior,duskblade,youmuus,cleaver,ga. Ravenous isn't terrible but again, if you really need the wave clear then evolve w. As assassin shouldn't be wave clearing anyway.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]}
