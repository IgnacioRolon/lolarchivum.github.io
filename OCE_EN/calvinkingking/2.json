Sona is already strong enough tbh. She builds ap but she can heal a shit ton. She builds support and she deals shit tons of magic damage and now you want to make her ult unblockable? What the fuk dude. She has a decent movement speed boost and it would be so easy to kill enemies when there is no shield that can counterplay her ult","replies":[{"poster":"Calvinkingking","date":"2016-08-23T15:31:31.718+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"no, i mean just for braum, how could his sheild can block sona's ult, morg's sheild and fio's w can cancel it but just for a person, braum's sheild can block it for a whole team, this is my point","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"dragon poo","date":"2016-08-14T09:03:17.969+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Fiora's w doesnt pierce windwall/braums shield either. any ability that isnt a laser doesnt pierce braums shield/windwall. because they are considered a projectile, i think that is rather fair.","replies":[{"poster":"Nightjar","date":"2016-08-15T00:39:45.634+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I still argue though that in the upcoming yasou nerf (maybe riot has hinted at it) they shouldn't nerf his damage or anything, just tone his windwall down to 3s from 3.75s. It's a semi-hard nerf that still rewards clutch windwalls but makes it less gamechanging in a teamfight compared to say other champion's ultimates.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Légs","date":"2016-08-14T13:39:50.204+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I don't see a problem with it personally, as she has an instant cast time and her ult travels very quickly. Braum's e isn't a reliable way to negate her ult, although I do agree that it doesn't make any sense logically.\n\nAs for MF, I see her quite frequently when the team comp is appropriate. She's a situational pick that does her particular job well.","replies":[]}]}
