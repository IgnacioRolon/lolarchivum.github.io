I&#039;m sorry for all the things you have had to deal with lately, I really am. But your actions have crossed the line. The last time you were punished, we warned you that we do not condone extreme negativity of any kind. Considering that, we cannot look past this incident, no matter the circumstances surrounding it.\r\n\r\n&iuml;uv mmmmmmmmmmm: idiot\r\n\r\n&iuml;uv mmmmmmmmmmm: i dont care..\r\n\r\n&iuml;uv mmmmmmmmmmm: ye im feeding \r\n&iuml;uv mmmmmmmmmmm: let me show u real feeding\r\n\r\nDuring the games in question, you created an extremely negative experience for your fellow Summoners. I know League can get pretty intense sometimes, but retaliating to such a degree is never an excusable or justifiable action. The language you employed demeaned your fellow Summoners to an extreme extent, which is never OK.\r\n\r\nTo see the most recent games which led to this action, please log in to the client to view your reform card. While we do our best at Riot Games to encourage reform, we permanently remove players who continue to create negative experiences from our game.\r\n\r\nThis action is only taken after repeated or extreme infractions and we will not lift the suspension under any circumstance.\r\n\r\nAlthough this marks the end of the line, we&rsquo;re confident that with some reflection you will be able to avoid this kind of situation with whatever new games you decide to play.\r\n\r\nBest of luck in your future endeavors.\r\n\r\nGeneralKrunchman\r\nDiana Main\r\n\r\nPlayer Behavior Support Specialist\r\n\r\n&quot;I speak only truth&quot;\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nye ,  lol ,  u never checking teammates chats,   they are doing nothign  and trashtalk to me ,\r\n\r\ncan u check my last game damage, \r\n\r\nmy damage is best , \r\n\r\ni only dead 6 times,\r\n\r\ni never feed 1 game in my life,  \r\ni aways try my best play every single game ,  now  u banned me  .\r\n\r\nits not fucking ok ,\r\n\r\nriot","replies":[{"poster":"Fitzky","date":"2017-09-03T05:47:09.145+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":4,"body":"So I make a racist implication towards people like this and apparently I'm being mean {{sticker:zombie-brand-mindblown}}","replies":[{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2017-09-04T01:33:53.112+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"\"I make a racist implication\"\nAnd usually an unfounded or irrelevant one, so yes.

The report function exists so people don't *have* to speak up publically about it, if they don't want to. You can say the community is simply \"overly sensitive\" as much as you want, but when it comes to more serious issues (like racism) it's certainly understandable for people to be offended.\n\nI'd certainly recommend you take Seras' advice and keep that kind of attitude amongst groups you know will take no issue with it.","replies":[{"poster":"Fitzky","date":"2017-09-04T11:47:34.968+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":4,"body":"Right forgot I was speaking to the forum mod Nazi's who are an equivalent to a brick wall when trying to understand anything that's outside of Riots EULA, but that's exactly what you signed up for wasn't it?

I dunno about you but if I had impressionable (and often mean spirited) young teenagers of my own I wouldn't want them thinking it was ok to go around spouting hate to anyone you see, joke or otherwise. \n\nThere is an argument for not being \"too sensitive\", but when it comes to *real world* issues that have *real world serious* impacts like racism, you have to respect the reality. Perpetuating racism/hate gets real people really hurt, like physically hurt.

Essentially spamming the boards will do no good to your situation.\n\nTo be honest, from what I've seen in your posts, there's not going to be any change to your situation. When it comes down to it, you are responsible for your actions, so talking about your punishment means the actions of others become irrelevant.\n\nIf there are other players who you've seen break the rules, and you believe there's been nothing done in regards to their situation, you can report them by submitting a ticket to Support (a different ticket to the appeal) and they will pass it onto the Player Behaviour team for further consideration.\n\nIf you want my suggestion, I'd recommend not getting involved with players who use chat to abuse, harass, offend and/or troll other players. You're just playing into their \"game\" when you do, and it can cause unnecessary problems for you if you're not careful how you handle the situation. Ignore them, use the mute feature if you have to, and report them in the post-game lobby. There's no need to put yourself in the line of fire for the sake of a few words.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"CHEESYLEEKS","date":"2017-09-04T14:36:32.131+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"Not just this community,the majority of the western world is now like this....","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Roguestoney","date":"2017-09-03T23:06:51.934+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Lol get rekt mate.","replies":[]},{"poster":"DarkShade918","date":"2017-09-05T10:25:19.475+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Seras, you can talk to riot right, if Fitzky can be banned, can't the OP, he's been spamming for weeks now....","replies":[{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2017-09-06T04:46:09.243+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'm a boards mod as well, I'll take a look at his history and remove the spam, I wasn't aware he'd been spamming (I've been a bit out of the loop while I'm  moving).
