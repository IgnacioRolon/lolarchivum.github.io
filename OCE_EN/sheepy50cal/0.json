For example: i went 14-5-18 as Kindred jungle which should be a lot of champion mastery points as it is evidence of learning the champion and getting better with them but because we lost that game I get 219. Winning or losing games shouldn&#039;t be the decider as to how  if you get 200 points or 900. Having a champion mastered should show you have experience playing that champion and do well with them, not that you won with that champion a lot.","replies":[{"poster":"Tele","date":"2015-10-22T08:45:56.469+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The thing is, if you lost, clearly something went wrong. I doesn't matter if \"someone else fed\" there's always something you could have done to win that game.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Klavinmour","date":"2015-10-22T06:10:31.423+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You get a certain amount for winning, and a certain amount based on how you did on the champ compared to that champion's average playerbase.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Billos","date":"2015-10-22T05:28:07.680+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"If it was a single player game I might agree with you. Having your Mastery Score depend purely on your individual play in LoL would promote much more selfish behaviour in game though in my opinion.","replies":[]}]}
