Refunding altered products","subforum":"Miscellaneous","up_votes":3,"down_votes":2,"body":"Hey guys, thought I would bring to light an issue I think is notable in the current game system after my discussion with Riot support.\r\n\r\nWhile I definitely feel the Irelia rework is fantastic, there is one problem with it, and that is that League currently has no system in place for players to refund items when the product itself changes, as seen with Frostblade Irelia.\r\n\r\nThe new Frostblade Irelia skin contains many upgrades from the old one, but it also looks completely different visually from the old skin in terms of style and colour choice. \r\n\r\nBecause I feel that this skin is effectively a different product from the one I originally purchased, I think it is fair to have the product traded or refunded for RP without the use of refund tokens. \r\n\r\nObviously this is a special case, unique to champion reworks and other cases where skins change dramatically, and skins changing from their original style itself is uncommon in reworks. Regardless I think it is best that a feature or option be added in for refunds of vastly changed products either within the League client or through Riot support staff, who currently cannot help without refund tokens.","replies":[{"poster":"Lord Sesshomaru","date":"2018-04-08T14:11:02.520+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"I agree with this 100% \n\nWhile most major VU updates are pretty good, and almost always result in an outcome that people are more satisfied with, the changes are often enough that the new champion only vaguely resembles the old one, so calling it the same product just because the 'new' champ has the same name as a champ that used to exist, is a bit of a cop-out. \n\nhttps://imgur.com/a/ZGlBT\n\n^ Many players today wouldn't even know who that champ is, let alone what he used to do.\n1 ability is similar, that and the name. How can you justify calling that the same product as the champ we have today?\nIts like giving someone a Coke Zero when they ordered a Coffee and saying _\"whats the problem? its still brown and in a cup.\"_\n\nTherefore I think reworked champs and their skins should be treated as new products. This means that within the first week of release, players should have the option to refund the champion and or skins for the price they were purchased at, without consuming any refund tokens. _(Realistically very few people are gunna refund a shiny new skin, but having the option would make people feel less at the mercy of the system when their stuff gets changed out of the blue.)_\n\nHowever being treated as a 'new' champ, they should also be bumped up to max BE and RP price in the store, and their skins' prices be updated as well to reflect quality changes. Thats only fair to Riot.\n\n\n_________________\n\nLegally, there is no argument, it says in the terms and conditions of the game that we as players don't own any of the content we purchase  , _(we don't even own our accounts)_. So seeming we don't own any of the content we buy, thats how they get away with changing it whenever they like without repercussions. Becasue they're only changing their own stuff, not ours, we just borrow it. _(e.g. you cant take your neighbour to court when he re-paints his lawnmower that you borrow on Saturday morning.)_\n\nLegally, no. But morally, yes, they should allow refunds when content like Frostblade Irelia is drastically changed.","replies":[{"poster":"AlzenJajigro","date":"2018-04-12T00:41:43.695+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I definitely agree with your approach there, it balances it out well for Riot and I think they'd also find that even when people do refund one skin, they will likely use that RP on a skin for the same champion that they may not have purchased otherwise. This makes it a pretty circular system, and Riot wouldn't lose out. y\n\nDefinitely agree on the legal standpoint though, I don't feel like Riot is really doing anything that is surprising, given we accepted their EULA, though as you say morally and for gaining favour with their community there are better ways to go about this.\n\nHopefully, we will see a change sometime down the road, I felt like I should post about this here to try and assist with that process.","replies":[]}]}]}
