I had a look to see if anyone else had been having issues as well but i have only been able to find a discussion with similar problem but from around 9 months ago (when i was able to log in), just to be sure i followed some of the tips and advice people said in that discussion but again it did nothing. now im hoping to find someone with the same issue and seeing if he or she may help.","replies":[{"poster":"DragonOfTheVoid","date":"2015-10-18T15:35:02.480+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I had that as well but I new that I was gona get a new laptop in a week and fixed","replies":[]},{"poster":"Unforgiiven","date":"2015-10-19T08:18:07.298+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Have you tried uninstalling and reinstalling?
