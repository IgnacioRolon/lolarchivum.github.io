It's not a guaranteed fix but it has fixed it for some. The easiest way to run a clean reinstall is via the [Hextech Repair Tool](https://support-leagueoflegends.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/224826367-Automated-Troubleshooting-Hextech-Repair-Tool).\n\n**RE Champion Select:**\nI'm not aware of any global issues with this at the moment, so it could be either local to you or just affecting a smaller population. The same clean reinstall may resolve this issue, but it could also be connection or other related. Do you get any error messages? Crashes? Describe in detail what happens when you are prevented from entering champion select and I'll see what info I can find for you.\n\n**RE Friends List:**\nThis issue is resolved for many (unfortunately not all) people by running a clean reinstall *and* resyncing and automating their computer clock. For Windows 10 you can do this by searching \"Date and Time\" in the start menu, opening the settings menu that comes up, turning on \"Set time automatically\" and \"Set time zone automatically\" and then pressing the \"Sync Now\" button.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Rumpsauce","date":"2020-01-25T04:38:57.022+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"As this poor soul has stated.
