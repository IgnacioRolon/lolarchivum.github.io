Well i did flame bard like once early he decided to be butthurt and rage at me for the rest of the game. I did not know why but my entire team listened to him and all flamed me. Obviously i got angry and raged back and got reported. I leave to eat and like 10 mins later i come back to see that i am perma banned. Riot may you please give me a second chance league is all i have.{{item:3070}} {{item:3070}} {{item:3070}}","replies":[{"poster":"SephirothSG","date":"2016-01-18T08:26:02.448+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey there Heracross,\n\nIf you would like your ban reviewed you'll have to [submit a ticket](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/requests/new) to Player Support as they're the only ones who can review your ban.\n\nWe all have bad games sometimes, however being toxic is not the answer, if your team are being toxic toward you, mute them and report them after the game has finished.","replies":[]}]}
