But it's not too bad bot lane when turning a won trade into a kill then into two kills.\n\nGiven how it operates I suppose it is meant to feel like a reset champ sort of mechanic (trist/katarina), its just doesn't get to turn on when you spend most or all of your time attacking the tank trying to run you down and when killing the enemy squishies is done by your fighters, mages, or assassins. However it is possible to get your passive rolling by getting assists through usage of your spells (all AOE and extreme long range) and your allies bursting and finishing those targets off.\nBut outside of this, it doesn't feel like a passive you can interact with or turn on which makes it feel underwhelming.\n\nAlso, an attack speed buff on what is arguably an AD mage makes most builds feel like they are under-utilizing at least one part of his kit, often two. (Passive and W).\nYou want flat AD and armour pen, and you have this passive that means you don't typically need to build as much attack speed. But if you wanted to also build crit to synergize with your passive on the off chance you get it rolling and can rely on auto's for a bit, you end up building more attack speed by default anyway as most crit items come coupled with it.\nAgain, in any case, most item builds will feel sub-optimal on Varus if you're trying to make the most of ALL of his abilities.\n\nI will say that while learning how to play marksmen, Varus' passive makes it super easy to last hit as you always have bonus attack speed up so you miss far fewer creeps between auto attacks during the early game where your attack speed is so low.\nThis allowed me to focus on learning lane trading, positioning, and matchups which accelerated how quickly I was able to learn the role overall.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Saturok","date":"2016-01-07T21:44:18.235+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"{{champion:58}} - Hello","replies":[]}]}
