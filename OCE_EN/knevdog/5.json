She is level 30, and played for years, while I am level 18 now and only just got my keystone mastery. I can only play Normals as I am not level 30.\n\nWe are now being paired against people who are much higher skill level than myself, and even higher than my housemate. She has commented as such, and it is honestly driving us insane. We are now losing a lot more of our games, and those that we are winning are ones that we are definitely being carried in. \n\nIt's all fine and well to say \"git gud\" but honestly I have been playing for less than a month. I'm not a smurf, and have only played HotS before joining. I am average at best, mediocre more likely.\n\nI would rather wait another couple minutes than have to queue into people who are so much better in MMR than myself or my housemate.","replies":[{"poster":"KnevDog","date":"2017-11-17T05:09:52.265+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey Tauna, i know man it's not friendly, i too played hot's and atleast i got paired with people my own skill level, \nits a very hard game to learn league too, hang in there man, :( or play ranked regardless of where you start off, atleast it will be evenly matched","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Fuszin","date":"2017-10-04T14:37:41.634+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Well Normal's is what is... i think Riots main focus aims towards keeping the \"legitimate\" game modes like Ranked Solo/Duo Proper. If you're looking for a casual game sure go normal's, if you want structure and a more profound matchmaking system Solo/duo is where you should be playing. There's no way to stop Higher Ranked players from destroying you whether it be on a Smurf Account or Main Account its going to happen, Take advantage of the encounters with much better players and learn from them!\n{{sticker:slayer-pantheon-thumbs}}","replies":[{"poster":"KnevDog","date":"2017-10-05T03:41:55.780+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"yeah seems that way :) thanks","replies":[]}]}]}
