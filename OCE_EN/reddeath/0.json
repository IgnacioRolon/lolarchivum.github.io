You've addressed that you have looked into both of the recent dc/lag issues but have you really?\r\nI just played a game of ARAM where my ping didn't go below 200 yet in load screen it was fine, Checked internet and it was fine so how am I able to constantly spike from 200 ping to 15k yet you guys can say that we've fixed the lag?\r\nC'mon guys be real some of us have actually put money into this game for a more enjoyable time but how can we have fun if we have a 10 second delay to YOUR servers.","replies":[{"poster":"RazorGTX22","date":"2015-02-08T07:50:49.303+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"And as usual...no follow up to player concerns...why have these forums in the first place?","replies":[{"poster":"godsmustbecrazy3","date":"2015-02-08T22:54:37.388+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Lol this Razor. Welcome to the League forums bro. The support is not too bad actually. We just have to constantly nag them,  nags from lots of people will bring the main issues to their attention that needs to fixed quickly.\n\nExample: I had been asking the support for help about the Firewall issues for nearly 7 months, they never took it seriously. Now lots of users experiencing the same issue and posting on forums, so now Riot doing something about it. Like contacting the ISP's for example to fix the lagg and Firewall related issues.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"RazorGTX22","date":"2015-02-07T11:07:51.494+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Lag has always been a consistent issues on OCE (i have less latency and lag issues on NA)....but I must say the last few patches have been terrible. Two things i'd like to address....\n\n1) A few patches ago (4.16/ 4.17...cant remember) patch note said 'loading times would decrease by 30%\"...which they did, it was great...now though last 3-4 patches loading times have been terrible....the time to 100% is back to the old days...but then everyone will sit at 100% and will still take the game 2 full minutes to loads..whats up with that?\n\n2) OK..noticed last few patches....getting major stuttering if the game goes over 30-35 minutes. Most of my friends that live in the local area get it (thats on multiply exchanges and ISPs). Only ways to fix to DC and reconnect...but its only a temporary fix. Anyone else getting this or does riot know of the problem?\n\nSorry to hijack the thread...seen the lag issue up so I added to the conversation. If you dont approve i'll soon make a separate thread on the issue, and also put a tech support ticket in with the problem.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Riot Cochese","date":"2015-02-07T09:35:45.355+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"We do care, can you please follow the instructions in the Lag and Disconnects sticky, follow through to our network diagnostic tool and send us the details. We would love to get a better understanding of your issue and see if we can help.\n\nI am curious though, have you tried reaching out to your ISP provider. I use Telstra and the other day I ran a speed test, where I was getting 2.8mbs down, turns out they were doing some work in the area. The only reason I ask, is you seem to be experiencing this on and off. It would be worth looking into, and please still send us your info in case it is something we can help with.","replies":[]},{"poster":"HORSE OF FORCE","date":"2015-02-07T08:17:19.178+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"They are tinkering around with the setup, with putting in new hardware and changing the server *settings*. Coincidentally this has caused issues with some people, but not all. Thus, Riot aren't really inclined to fix this problem as it's not real priority.\n\nIt's frustrating, I know, but the best you can do is wait. Send in a ticket and ask them about what point they're at concerning fixing it, I'm sure they'll tell you at least that much.","replies":[]}]}
