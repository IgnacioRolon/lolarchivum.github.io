Riot haven't actually official supported Windows 8. It's not in the minimum system requirements (last I checked, at least).\n\nAlso, did you by any chance install any keyboard drivers?","replies":[{"poster":"Kud0s","date":"2015-06-18T06:37:10.388+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Ahhh okay, well the problem seems to have fixed itself automatically without me doing anything.
