Wins Games when he feels like it.\r\n\r\nBro his fed in every game ive seen so far and been paired with. Does Riot really condone this behavior?  . Does RIOT  really not want people to win there games. They want people to rage and quit there game and quit spending money on it. Seems like it man cause every time I report someone 90% chance I will be chatting with a bot in that report. This report 100% wont be take into account and he will be left off the hook cause RIOT wont even care about him hard demoting people that want to climb guarantee you 100% I'll see this guy again. For those who say  trash then why dont you duo with him and find out ?","replies":[{"poster":"Jockulation","date":"2019-07-25T16:42:25.755+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"As long as he doesn't say anything naughty (and even then people who do say shit like KYS don't get banned (Have Proof)), nothing will happen.","replies":[]},{"poster":"SOOM","date":"2019-07-24T01:05:12.712+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Ready for the [Name removed]","replies":[]},{"poster":"Broken Scripts","date":"2019-07-24T00:34:07.926+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"naming and shaming","replies":[]}]}
