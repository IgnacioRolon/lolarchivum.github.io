This only occurs for about 5 seconds, 10 seconds at max and then I can play normally. It occurs every 2-3 minutes and is rather annoying to deal with as during teamfights I am unable to do much. Can anyone give me any suggestion how to fix this?","replies":[{"poster":"Wuks","date":"2015-12-11T12:57:25.882+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey GoldenPandaWars,\n\nIf you're having connection issues, I strongly urge you to try the solutions in the [**Troubleshooting Connection Issues**](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues) Riot Games Support article.","replies":[]}]}
