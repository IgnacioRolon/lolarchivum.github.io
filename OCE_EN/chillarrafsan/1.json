Ending this reform period requires consistent displays of good sportsmanship. Your reform period isn't over after a specific number of games, or after a certain date, but is completely dependent upon your behavior.\n\nThe short FAQ section also has some answers\n\n>Why can't you tell me exactly when I'm going to be eligible?\n\n>Eligibility is dependent on a consistent display of good sportsmanship, not just \"be nice in X number of games or days.\" Negative behavior during this reform period will cause it to last longer.\n\n_________________________________________________________________________________________\n\n>How long does it usually take for someone to be eligible again?\n\n>There is no specific timeframe for eligibility, and the length of the reform period may vary on a case by case basis. It all depends on the severity of your punishment, and on your behavior moving forward.\n\nHope this helps :)","replies":[{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2016-07-01T19:28:41.395+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thanks for being so helpful around the boards :)","replies":[{"poster":"Corehog","date":"2016-07-02T01:41:00.048+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'm trying to increase my Chi or Karma, whichever one makes me a dragon in the afterlife","replies":[{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2016-07-02T14:54:25.826+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Why not both?
