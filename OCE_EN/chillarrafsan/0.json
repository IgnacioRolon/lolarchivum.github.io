However, since it's normals, it's not ranked play in any way, so they will get warnings (like the AFK ones) implying something like, \"You have recently been reported for summoner harassment and bullying/intentional feeding. We know everyone has their bad days, but remember to...\". What I don't understand though, is that if you go AFK or abandon a game in normals (even in bots!), you'll get your ~~fair~~ unfair punishment for it. Trolling and feeding is just as bad. I don't think they deserve two-week bans, let alone permabans, but chat restriction for the next five normals should teach them a lesson. Just like the AFK penalty.","replies":[{"poster":"JasonWazza","date":"2016-07-01T04:12:25.884+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":">Bans only come from ranked games\n\nYou sir don't understand the banning system.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Roguestoney","date":"2016-06-30T15:27:28.589+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Better off posting this on NA not on OCE.","replies":[]},{"poster":"IndianGamer","date":"2016-06-30T21:03:07.297+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"RIOT is noob and its confirm don't rage here no point, in few years this company will shut down bcoz this game is so boring now. anyways not RIOT take sides of troll+feeders even in diamond that's y I don't like to play anymore","replies":[]}]}
