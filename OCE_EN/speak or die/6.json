We stomped that game though, lol. Is this bugged?\r\n\r\nAlso, my adc can&#039;t play tomorrow so we need a replacement. Can we get subs?? And can we change who the team captain is as he is the captain and I need to add the new sub to the team?! I&#039;m pretty worried. \r\n\r\nOverall AMAZING experience. Thank you so much riot &lt;3","replies":[{"poster":"Domine Vindictam","date":"2018-06-05T12:08:28.625+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey there! Clash was pretty fun right?\n\nAnyways, it seems you may have mixed up Clash with Butchers Bridge regarding the \"all champs\" thing.\n\nAnd if the counter goes down while you're hovering, it will select that champion (like the old blindpick) since it'd be silly cancelling an entire tournament match because someone forgot to lock in!\n\nSadly **only the team captain can appoint a new captain**, so you'll have to try and beg him to log in real quick at any moment he can to captainize(not a word) someone else!\n\nAnd yes you can sub! Since you've competed in the first beta tournament yay!!!\nI suggest heading over to [Team Recruitment](https://boards.oce.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/team-recruitment) if you're looking for substitutes! \n\nGood luck with your next bracket, Summoner!","replies":[]}]}
