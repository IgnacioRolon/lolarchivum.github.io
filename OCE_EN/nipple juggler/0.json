I think it should be discontinued, even though there are trolls out there. The trolls do make us lose games a lot, but so do game crashes. If I got one dollar every time my laptop crashed, I would probably have about $10. Every time this has happened, I got a Leaverbuster. I do occasionally leave games, but that is quite rare. I do not think that the Leaverbuster program should be continued. Even if it isn&#039;t discontinued, I would still like it to not add up when the game crashes. If this was the case, I would only have one Leaverbuster, rather than the ten I have probably received before now. Trolls can be harmful to your game and make you sad, but so can a Leaverbuster which was earned by crashing and the game automatically closing. Any thoughts on this?","replies":[{"poster":"Project Xayah","date":"2015-06-21T12:04:34.329+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"A faulty connection/computer causing disconnections consistently enough to cause LB is the fault of the player, as outlined in the TOU and EULA.

What's that? You don't have one?
