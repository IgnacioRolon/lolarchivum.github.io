I think you should be unbanned and be allowed a chance to reform, but Riot doesn't. My original main was banned after a few matches where I was losing my mind. I'd had the worst week of my life and started trolling in a couple of games, and even though 99% of the matches played were completely normal (I even had green banner when I was banned), they still did it and usually allow zero chance of redemption if I remember correctly. They don't actually care about people.\n\nOn a side note, I'll probably be banned on this account too. at the start of the year I'd had another horrible week and stupidly took it out on a couple of teams who were trolling me. Of course, they all reported me, and I was told I'd be banned with one more offence. Today I simply had a bad game, not trolling or anything but probably complained a bit too much, and undoubtedly everyone has reported me for it and I'll be banned, again with no chance of redemption. It really makes me want to simply waste my money on smurfs and troll every single game.","replies":[{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2019-10-01T05:35:34.725+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":2,"body":"If they're all typical chat punishments, you get three chances to reform before perma-ban. If it's gameplay or severe chat you still get one. If you go a long enough period without negativity, you'll drop punishment tiers so you get more.\n\nEven after a permanent ban, you are still completely free to create a new account.","replies":[{"poster":"delete this","date":"2019-10-01T05:44:44.385+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":2,"body":"How long is the period before dropping a punishment tier supposed to be? Because on my main, I'd played at least 100 matches before having that bad day. And three chat punishments before a permaban? You can recieve a chat punishment simply for saying \"shit\". do that three times in a year without thinking=permaban? Of course my case was more extreme, some horrible things happened to me and I took it out on people, but two of those \"chances\" were used up that week, leaving the final chance to be used up on one bad day nearly the next year.\n\nyour punishment system is shit, and makes people WANT to make accounts just to troll, since dedicated trolls are punished just as harshly as your average joe who might have a few bad days throughout the year.\n\nYou want everybody to be as tolerant as Ghandi himself. Jesus.","replies":[{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2019-10-01T05:53:34.246+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"For the average player, it's about 3 months, but it's also variable. Negativity, even without punishment, will set you back. Positivity will drop your tier faster than neutrality will. In other words, the time can vary quite drastically by individual.\n\nYou will *never* on OCE receive a legitimate chat restriction just for saying 'shit'. If anyone was punished for that, the advice would without question be to appeal.\n\nNobody is perfect, and nobody expects everyone to be perfect. However, the vast majority of punished players reform after their first punishment, and at a point, Riot (and therefore the system) has to prioritise the protection of the many other players over the reformation of one player who has already had chances to do so.\n\nDo remember also that this game is rated M (~13+).","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"bgentle2myashe","date":"2019-10-01T08:39:38.500+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"In my opinion you do the crime you do the time. Especially if it's multiple infringements. I hope you don't take it personally from me or riot but you can't just apologize you're way out of doing what you know to be wrong. If you're really serious about reforming there should be no length of time too long to wait for you're second chance. That's actually what being sorry means is doing what has to be done to prove you're regret.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Pikachoochoo","date":"2019-10-01T05:24:41.624+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"do you  have all the logs that led to your ban","replies":[]},{"poster":"Project Xayah","date":"2019-10-01T04:29:34.382+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"In order to appeal a ban you'll need to submit a ticket to [Support](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/requests/new) (use the \"Discuss a personal suspension or restriction\" option) and go through the process with them.
