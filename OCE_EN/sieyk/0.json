For people who don&#039;t like clicking random links these numbers are:\nOceania: 183,743\nRussia: 139,496\n\nIt&#039;s pretty obvious that Oceania has considerably more players, even if you take into consideration that this is only solo queue stats, a similar ratio of solo queue players between regions is to be expected, so we can assume, on average, that russia has a lower overall population when compared to Oceania, and, in fact, the rest of the world, as Russia is the smallest region by population.\n\nThe problem is the fact that Russia has every single normal queue available at all times, that means 3v3, dominion, aram, team builder and of course blind pick. As well as Ranked 5v5 and Ranked 3v3 during certain times. Why is it that a server with a lower population has many more queues than one with a higher population?\n\nI personally enjoy 3v3 greatly and the lack of a Ranked queue is a major disappointment for the Oceanic server. Time and time again the community has asked for a Ranked 3v3 queue only to be denied with the excuse that &quot;It would take away from other queues and won&#039;t work out.&quot; This argument has a flaw, and that is that this would only be the case if 3v3 and ranked 3v3 was extremely popular. Lets be generous and presume that 10% of solo queue players move to 3v3 SOME of the time, for bronze to gold, which makes up 90% of the server population, average queue time would also increase by approx 10% which is about 12-15 SECONDS AT WORST.\n\ntldr; The argument that queues would take too long after introducing ranked 3v3 or even other less popular queues like dominion is moot when you consider the fact that introducing them would only heavily affect other queues if the introduced queues were more popular than current queues which wouldn&#039;t be the case even after a week. Also the Russian server, which has a lower population, has access to all queues. Why can&#039;t Oceanic have more queues or even just 3v3 Ranked in the current 3v3 time slot with 3v3 up all the time?\n\n[LoLReddit Post](https://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/3wcb37/russia_has_a_lower_player_population_than_oceanic/)\n\n[Twisted Treeline Reddit Post](https://www.reddit.com/r/LoLTwistedTreeline/comments/3wcciv/russia_has_a_lower_player_population_than_oceanic/)","replies":[]}
