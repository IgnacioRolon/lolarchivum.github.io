They loved their blue buff, but sadly their jungler was a Master Yi and never gave any buffs to them.  But they still wanted blue buff. In the distance they could see the enemy jungle that had a blue buff just about to spawn, but alas there was only one way to get to it through a scuttle crab and into the enemy jungle, But in the enemy jungle lived a terrifically terrifying terrible troll called Trundle &ndash; he wanted his blue buff too.  And there was nothing he liked better than Triple kill.\r\nThe Little Amumu was the first to reach the scuttle crab.  Gingerly he put one  foot down and then another onto the vision area but because it was so risky however hard he tried, the entire enemy team could see him entering their jungle.\r\nSuddenly there was a message in /All chat &ldquo;Who&rsquo;s that entering my jungle?&rdquo; and out behind the wall loomed the Troll.  \r\nQuaking in his bandages, Little Amumu managed to squeak &lsquo;It&rsquo;s only me. I&rsquo;m only going to steal your blue buff.&rsquo; \r\n&ldquo;Oh no you&rsquo;re not!  I&rsquo;m going to murder you and eat you up!&rdquo;\r\n&lsquo;Oh no!&rsquo; said terrified Little Amumu.  &ldquo;I&rsquo;m just Little Amumu.  Why don&rsquo;t you wait for my midlaner She is more fed than me and much tastier.&rdquo; \r\nSo the greedy Troll decided to wait and Little Amumu skipped over the vision area began to take the blue buff on the other side. The other Champions saw Little Amumu taking the blue buff and were jealous because they wanted it too.  So Middle Sized Lux went down to the scuttle crab and began to cross the vision area. Yet again the entire enemy team could see her walking.  Again the Troll loomed out from behind the wall.\r\n&lsquo;Who&rsquo;s that entering my jungle?&rsquo; he type in /All chat.\r\nQuaking in her armor, Middle Sized Lux managed to say in his softest voice &lsquo;It&rsquo;s only me.  I&rsquo;m following my brother, Little Amumu, so I can steal your blue buff&rdquo;.\r\n&ldquo;Oh no you&rsquo;re not!  I&rsquo;m going to murder you and eat you up!&rdquo;\r\n&ldquo;Oh no, Mr Troll, you wouldn&rsquo;t want to eat me.  I&rsquo;m not fed enough to get you next item.  Wait until my big brother comes along &ndash; he&rsquo;s much more fed than me.&rdquo;\r\n&ldquo;Oh all right&rdquo; said the Troll and Middle Sized Lux scampered over the vision area and began to take the blue buff with Little Amumu.\r\nBig bold Garen was jealous and couldn&rsquo;t wait to get across the vision area and steal the blue buff.  So boldly, he put his boots onto the vision area. He started to Ctrl+3, Suddenly the Troll loomed out from under the bridge.\r\n&lsquo;Who&rsquo;s that dancing on my scuttle crab?&rsquo; he typed in /All chat.\r\n&ldquo;It&rsquo;s me.  Big Garen.  Who do you think you are?&rdquo;\r\n&lsquo;I&rsquo;m the Troll and I&rsquo;m going to murder you and eat you up!&rdquo;\r\n&ldquo;Oh no, you&rsquo;re not&rdquo;\r\n&ldquo;Oh yes I am &ndash; you&rsquo;ll see!&rdquo;\r\nThen the Troll charged at Garen who raised his sword and bravely charged at the Troll, catching him up in his Decisive Strike and silencing him so he do nothing. \r\nMaster Yi then came in and got a pentakill and the blue buff, they took the nexus and won the game, Master Yi got reported.\r\n\r\nThe End\r\n\r\n(This is a parody of Three Billy Goats Gruff if you didn&#039;t notice c:)","replies":[{"poster":"Waysted1","date":"2016-06-30T05:49:02.048+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"lol so good","replies":[{"poster":"Ryamu","date":"2016-06-30T05:57:39.773+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thanks fam <3","replies":[]}]}]}
