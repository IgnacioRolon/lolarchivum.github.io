It isn&#039;t completely game breaking, more so annoying and frustrating.\r\n\r\nAt the end of games when I click &#039;Continue&#039; when victory or defeat occurs, &#039;leave&#039; the game if it be in a custom, normal, or ranked I get this error. The game freezes for a moment and you can clearly hear a &#039;Bing&#039; error noise. It doesn&#039;t minimize the game or anything, unless I ALT TAB out which becomes very glitchy since the client is &#039;bugged&#039;. I get this TEMP folder error and then after a few moments, everything resumes and league goes back to the client.\r\n\r\nThe link provided is the only screenshot I was able to get since if I tried to ALT Tab to just the error window, League would fill the screen in complete blackness.\r\n\r\nI haven&#039;t altered any settings since downloading league (Except turning off chat filter and newbie tutorials). I&#039;ve even tried updating everything on my PC to the latest and nothing works.\r\n\r\nIs there any fixes for this?","replies":[]}
