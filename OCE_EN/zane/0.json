As a first step, I would recommend turning off anything with an overlay like discord, overwolf, nvidia geforce, any 3rd party stuff etc. Once you've done that try a custom game.\n\nIf that doesn't help I'd next try stripping down everything. Turn off everything in task manager that isn't essential and see if you still have troubles.\n\nIf at any point you stop seeing the issue, then start turning things back on one by one until you can isolate the problem, and then fiddle with settings of whatever it is.\n\nIf you still see the issue after doing the above, it's probably something else, and I would first try a client repair, then a reinstall.\n\nFailing all that, submit a ticket to player support and they should be able to help you further: https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/requests/new","replies":[]}]}
