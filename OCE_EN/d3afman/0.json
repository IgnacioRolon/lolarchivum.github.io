It may even offer insight into current patch balance. We might discover hidden gems that have been 'balanced' out of existence in recent years and want to bring them back.\n\nAlthough it'd suck for people who play new champions, because you'd have to choose a patch somewhere in season 2/3 and revert the game to that. Removing new items/skins/champs from the game mode.\n\nI love new Taric, but oh what I'd give to one again play that magnificent beast the way nature intended.","replies":[]}]}
