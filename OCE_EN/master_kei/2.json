Both red and blue all give 45 AD, 10% cooldown reduction and 10% armor penetration.

(J4 uses it whole game because he doesnt build sustain and likes to be high mana and HP to be able to do anything in teamfights. and neither red or blue smite work well with him. since he has the CC so blue isnt as important and he doesnt NEED to duel, but his base stats are high enough that he can duel easily so barely needs red smite either. he lacks decent counterjungling, so white smite is weak. so end of the day, rangers/purple smite. is the best choice for him.)\n\nblue works on everyone, red works on duelers who dont need a slow. purple works on some. and poachers is REALLY situational.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Mar3thyu","date":"2015-02-07T06:32:30.600+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"{{item:3706}} for the slow also it deals a small amount of true damage not reduces \n{{item:3715}} reduces smited targets damage by 20% and deals true damage per aa for 3 seconds","replies":[]}]}
