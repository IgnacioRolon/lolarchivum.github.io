I just want a laptop that would run league at med - high specs at 60 fps. Would this laptop be good enough for this and is the price worth it for a laptop with the given specs? If not what would be a good laptop? Not willing to break $1100. http://www.ebay.com.au/itm/NEW-ASUS-F-X555LJ-i7-5500U-8GB-1TB-15-6-GeForce-GT920-Gaming-Laptop-Windows-10-/171953537734?hash=item28093ac2c6:g:hMsAAOSw14xWMbhB","replies":[{"poster":"Talon12","date":"2016-01-03T10:52:06.376+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Its specs are similar the the first computer i played league on, so i would say it should work fine.

You could spend like $600 on a decent laptop and get an external mouse, keyboard and monitor so you can play games better with the spare change.\n\nLook at those laptops that have a docking station so you can setup your gaming in seconds, basically a portable desktop PC.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Neeek ","date":"2016-01-03T07:56:11.308+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Easily.
