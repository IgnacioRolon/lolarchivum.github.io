So Riot, I'm asking you nicely if you could check up an message for me? This is really imporntant!\r\n\r\nBest Regards,\r\nYour lovely customer","replies":[{"poster":"HORSE OF FORCE","date":"2015-03-21T05:09:31.878+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Have you closed your client since then? I know some people like to put their computer into hibernate instead of shutdown for the night.
