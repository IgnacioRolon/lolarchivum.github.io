We are seeking out a nice outspoken support to assist our team!  \r\n\r\nWe are all very friendly and super funny.  I am our team captain playing Mid as well as ADC.  We&#039;d like our support to be very map aware and comfortable speaking to us as a whole.  To play in our tournaments you must be in Silver or Bronze this season as well as last.  Your flex and three&#039;s rank does not matter.  You also may continue to solo / duo through our season, even if you get to gold or higher!  However you must be Silver or below when signing up.\r\n\r\nWe ask that you be available to play with us 2 - 4 times a week.  We have a discord server that we speak in that is a required part of being on our team.  We believe it helps us grow together! Feel free to add me!  We are also accepting any Top or Junglers we have two people who currently are filling those spots but we would ideally like to have another just in case for whatever reason we need someone to fill in.\r\n\r\nCan&#039;t wait to hear from you!  \r\n-Mady","replies":[{"poster":"LVX Shane","date":"2017-09-30T01:44:57.626+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Add me iron shane im french but i understant english , i main top mid jg supp and i am gold5 solo silver1 flex","replies":[]},{"poster":"Main Line","date":"2017-09-29T23:03:42.670+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Is this for NA or OCE?","replies":[]},{"poster":"Lowrider","date":"2017-09-29T09:40:46.699+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"hey guys.. im a bronze supprot main with an 80% winrate for Blitz and a 4.00:1 KDA, if ur interested.. add me \nIGN: terrythebeast","replies":[]},{"poster":"APG Pharaoh","date":"2017-09-29T04:53:00.839+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'm a supp main, with experience with all types of supports.
