I hope this doesn't come off as Hostile or even angry. I don't want to ignorantly tell you guys how to do your jobs but there is currently a massive issue with the servers and clients OCE and NEEDS to be looked at ASAP!\n\nApart from the Client crashes, it is also just a really laggy client, where the store doesn't open sometimes, or just takes really long to load, player profiles take ages to load, occasionally my client would load with blank links (such as featured matches and featured skins on the home page) and I also found it wierd how the client kicks you out of you current screen when a game queue fails. \n\nAs for the lag issues, it's only been happening in the last couple of weeks but everyone I know has been experiencing it. I know it's not my end because I've got a high end computer and pretty good net, there would be no one else home, no other device connected to the internet and nothing else downloading or open in the background. I'd have 60fps and 50ping yet my game would still be laggy. (Again I hope I haven't offended or come across as angry)\n\nPlease look into and prioritise over in game balancing and what not! The game is in a pretty good spot atm!","replies":[]},{"poster":"Yasei Doubutsu","date":"2015-05-22T06:55:58.367+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Im having something similar *Hopefully its just the same thing*.\nMy client has had lag issues *im still 50-60 ping*\nbut I can play any other game that requires online and play fine.
