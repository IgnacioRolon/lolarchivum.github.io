Sounds like you're talking about the most recent ocean week, the points earned during the 2016 ocean week will be going towards the Ocean Week community wall (More details coming in the near future).\n\nThe Nautilus Reef was for ocean week 2015, which is not the most recent. You only had to earn 3 points during the 2015 ocean week for your name to be on the reef.\n\nYou can find more information in [this thread](http://boards.oce.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/miscellaneous/LuyUu4E2-notice-nautilus-reef-and-you).","replies":[]}]}
