However, this makes him vulnerable to gank unless you just go back to your tower after each wave in which case, you won't be ahead by any means. when jungler ganks, who normally has 1 cc/dash/high damage ability, combine with mid, if they have 2/3 of their health, they can kill heimer before his turrets kill them. In team fights heimer heavily rely on fighting within his turret range, which is considerably hard since enemy adc can kill turrets very easily and thats about 1/3 of his damage gone. His ult turret isn't great either as it require too much time to deal enough damage to matter.","replies":[]},{"poster":"DragonOfTheVoid","date":"2015-10-27T06:30:11.040+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"he gets super good if you go for this build \n{{item:3027}} {{item:3020}} {{item:3116}} {{item:3151}} {{item:3157}} and if you need to kill tanks get {{item:3135}} or if you need to kill them 2k hp nubs get {{item:3089}} you will have 3k hp, bs damage, slows, % hp damage and  mr pen so complete bs","replies":[{"poster":"Gentleman Gnar","date":"2015-10-27T07:08:49.097+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I never seen this build in a,{{champion:74}} I might try it, and see if it is a good build, and i should know because i try to find the best build for champs i Main (Yes I main heim, but this is my thoughts) Btw of you tried to use a{{item:3003}}  to replace the {{item:3135}} ","replies":[{"poster":"DragonOfTheVoid","date":"2015-10-27T07:23:21.158+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"no it ses {{item:3135}} its good as he gets so good vs all champs and has about 3k hp lv 18","replies":[{"poster":"Gentleman Gnar","date":"2015-10-27T07:30:44.989+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Ya, that's true","replies":[{"poster":"DragonOfTheVoid","date":"2015-10-27T13:17:14.531+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"lols\nand ps I love donger also know as {{champion:74}} and tryindmon also know as {{champion:23}}","replies":[]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"KidConfucius","date":"2015-10-27T12:38:47.778+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"He punishes you for poor positioning and over committing ,  people often underestimate the sustained damage from his turrets , while heimer himself has reasonable burst and cc depending on which skill he chooses to use his ult on.
