So, as you know, we can only choose &quot;English&quot; for this server, but ... They are not only english people ahah. Usually english people are a bit made when we speak french in a game, because they don&#039;t know that they are also french people in the server. So, I would like to know if it&#039;s possible to add &quot;French&quot; for the server ?\r\nI know it&#039;s juste a detail, but please, do it, we are here too ahah.\r\nThank&#039;s for reading guys !","replies":[{"poster":"SephirothSG","date":"2016-03-17T23:08:56.956+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey there,\n\nThis is definitely possible to do on your own, all you have to do is follow the steps outlined below.\n\nOpen the file **regions.txt** located in Riot Games\\League of Legends\\RADS\\projects\\lol_patcher\\managedfiles\\0.0.0.48 and edit it to look like the image below.\n\nhttp://puu.sh/nKlnL/fe289c8cf6.png\n\nSave the file and re-open your launcher, you should then be able to select your desired language by clicking the arrow in the top right of the launcher, going to language and selecting French.\n\nhttp://puu.sh/nKlsW/6cda258be7.png\nhttp://puu.sh/nKlvi/d2f22edfd6.jpg","replies":[{"poster":"Garyx","date":"2016-03-18T08:24:07.441+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Oooooooooooookay thank you !\nI'll try, even if it stay unofficial :/\nBut thank you again ^^","replies":[]}]}]}
