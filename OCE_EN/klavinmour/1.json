There is almost no complaint at all about gameplay from anyone who has actually played the game.\r\n\r\nNow the actual DLC is future monsters and hunters. They are covered by the season pass.\r\nFuture maps come as free updates. (according to interviews with the Devs)\r\n\r\nWhat isn't covered by the season pass are the **weapon skins and monster skins**.\r\nWhich as it turns out is what people are calling **\"DLC\"** and complaining that they need to buy it separately from the seasons pass.\r\nSaying that \"There is $130 worth of DLC not covered by the season pass, this is complete bullshit\".\r\n\r\nNow I've played a lot, and I meant A LOT of TeamFortress 2. I have an inventory in the game worth maybe a bit over $1000. I've done the trading, worked the TF2 eConomy. Not once have I ever heard anyone refer to an **Umbrella Hat that has a pink heart flying around it as a piece of DLC**, nor have I ever heard anyone complain that it existed.\r\nJust like I have never heard of anyone call skins in League of Legends DLC or complain that they exist.\r\nWell okay there was that one guy Larry but come on people, no one listens to LARRY!\r\n\r\nI watched some random LoL streamer on Twitch the other night drop a few hundred dollars on CS:GO and unlock all these additional skins for weapons. Didn't see a single comment anywhere about Valve being unfair and keeping \"content\" locked away from players unless they pay for it on top.\r\n\r\nI don't even see people complaining about this in DotA2, and from my experience people in DotA2 will complain about a butterfly as if it's bringing the end of the world.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSo why do people complain about Evolve for doing exactly this? Why can't Evolve let you pay $2 extra to change your monster's skin colour to be purple?\r\nWhy does that skin NEED to be in the season pass?\r\nWhy don't you complain that TF2 doesn't have a season pass that gives you every hat in the game with every unusual effect?\r\nWhy don't you complain that Riot shouldn't be making new skins for LoL?","replies":[{"poster":"Niji","date":"2015-02-14T03:02:27.116+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Season passes should include all the important DLC like new missions, storylines, maps and characters besides that anyone who thinks that cosmetics HAVE to be included in a season pass is %%%%%%ed.","replies":[]},{"poster":"KingDinger","date":"2015-02-13T23:17:50.551+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"is evolve on console? it sounds like its a console gamer problem....self entitled little %%%%%es complaining that they dont get enough free stuff.....","replies":[{"poster":"Klavinmour","date":"2015-02-14T01:41:30.258+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It is yes, but the majority of people I find complaining are PC gamers.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"JasonWazza","date":"2015-02-13T05:53:20.458+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Because a \"season pass\" sounds like something that covers everything in game, and that makes people feel entitled and act like %%%%s.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Slim Chaedi","date":"2015-02-13T04:09:58.750+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I guess because its a big thing and, I would assume, due to the fact that they are marked as DLC in online stores because that is like only place you can put them? Except on Steam I guess, but I guess they don't want people trading them.\nI don't see the reason for the complaints though. Its just skins, and barely anyone would want to pay to get all of them anyway. Like, I'm not gonna get every skin for a character in League of Legends because I am not gonna use them all.\nIts on console and there is a wider audience I guess, so non-PC players aren't used to skins in games like this? I don't know.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Unseen Predator","date":"2015-02-14T04:21:55.574+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":3,"body":"Evolve is a $60+ game depending on where you live, League of Legends is free, Team Fortress 2 is free and CS:GO is about $14 plus the sales it has every few months, that's the difference between Evolve and those other games you mentioned and that is the reason why its bull%%%%, you pay a ton of money for the base game only to find content has been taken out and marked as DLC which is not the case in all those other games you mentioned.\n\nIf Evolve were free it would be great, if it were cheaper lets say $40 then sure that would be fine too but a full priced $60+ game is not ok and is the reason why its getting so much hate, personally i would never buy a game that has had so much content stripped away, in this case Evolve, devs that make games like Sims don't deserve any money from the consumers because the DLC is nothing but a cash grab when that content shouldve been in the base game, take Total War Rome 2 for example, they released DLC that adds blood to the game, now that is some bull%%%% and those developers deserve no money for trying to mess with the community like that.\n\nDon't hate me, i don't even care about the game i'm just explaining the reason why people are feeling this way about the game.","replies":[{"poster":"Klavinmour","date":"2015-02-14T05:07:56.861+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":3,"body":"Okay no, you are about 103% wrong here.\n\nThe base game has NOTHING stripped from it at all.\nNo content was removed from the base game.\n\nAll that \"DLC\" you keep talking about for Evolve is nothing more than skins. There is no other DLC for the game, least not yet.\nAs I said in my original post, future content is planned and that will be more monsters to play as and more of the hunter characters to play as, as well as new maps.\nThe additional characters will be paid DLC, the maps will be free updates.\n\n\n\nAnd no, TF2 is not free. I got the game years ago back when you had to pay $40 for it. I also got CS:GO on release and that set me back $50.\nCS:GO is only $14 now because it makes money from micro transactions.\nTF2 is only free now for the same reason.\n\n\nIn the OCE region new games cost $100. Evolve's base game is certainly worth that. It is a FULL game. It certainly has a lot of content for a base game that apparently according to you and every other internet idiot has 98% of it's content taken away from you if you only buy the base game.\n\n\n\nSkin are not DLC. Just because online markets default micro transactions as DLC does not make a micro transaction content DLC. Are skins in LoL DLC? NO. Therefore skins in Evolve are not DLC.\nAnd just like in LoL skins in Evolve make no impact on the game, so there is no reason in F**UC**K that you should be complaining about them.\n\nNo one every complained that you had to buy hats in TF2 when the game was $40 to buy.","replies":[{"poster":"Unseen Predator","date":"2015-02-14T05:43:14.436+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":2,"body":"You sound like one of those people that bought the game and will defend it no matter what, to which i say nothing because i'm not wasting my time on people like you.","replies":[{"poster":"Klavinmour","date":"2015-02-14T05:58:18.453+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"And you sound like a paint chip eating window licker who will buy the ideas of anyone who says that a company should be shut down because they plan to add content to a game after it's released.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}
