{"poster":"Klavinmour","date":"2017-01-21T13:32:05.573+0000","title":"Let's Talk META!","subforum":"Miscellaneous","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"So over the past few months complaints about the META have struck up again.\r\nSure this happens every time the META shifts and changes even a little bit, but this time we&#039;ve got quite the change don&#039;t we?\r\n\r\nMarksman/ADC is no longer the power house.\r\nThis started back with the Marksmen/ADC update. (Which laughably caused a lot of Youtubers/Streamers to quit League change to another game and the sudden change caused massive drop in their viewer base. That&#039;s another topic, but always a fun one to poke at since so many are salty over it)\r\nNow the changes here were quite good, making certain champs stand out more in the crowd like Graves and his reload mechanic (later seen on Jhin) and we also saw the much needed nerf to Jinx, for a while this created quite a diversity in bot lane.\r\nUnfortunately that didn&#039;t last long.\r\n\r\nBut now we have massive complaining everywhere that ADCs are being treated unfairly, they have no survival in this new Meta shift that has assassins being overbearing.\r\nAre they though?\r\n\r\n-----------------------------------\r\n\r\nLet&#039;s take a look at the last Meta that people really bitched and moaned about, the oh so dreaded TANK META!\r\nWas it really so bad?\r\nI don&#039;t think so, though I might be a bit biased, I love Tanks.\r\nIn MMOs I typically play Tank or Healer, this was originally because DERPS have queue times of 30+ minutes in most MMOs, but I just came to love taking no damage or canceling out all damage my team have taken.\r\nNow in League I feel that Tanks are underpowered, you can take a Rammus with 400 Armour and 5000 Health and he&#039;ll die in 2.5 seconds to most situations. (let&#039;s not even go where Vayne is for that scenario)\r\n\r\nLeague of Legends is very much about counter play, most people think counter play is entirely a champion&#039;s kit.\r\nBut where I find counter play to be most effective is in your item build.\r\nThere are a lot of items in LoL that you can build to counter tanks, the most effective two are {{item:3153}} and {{item:3151}} .\r\nItems and combination of items are very important.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately there aren&#039;t as many item options for AP users when it comes to penetration as there is for AD users.\r\n{{item:3151}} {{item:3135}} {{item:3020}} {{item:3001}}  vs {{item:3153}} {{item:3071}} {{item:3035}} {{item:3134}} (and the items those last two build into)\r\nThat&#039;s quite the difference, and the outcome of building some of these together can be drastically different. (I&#039;d love to see Armour Penetration Boots)\r\n\r\nPractically any AD champion can take a Blade of the Ruined King and utilise it pretty well, unfortunately it&#039;s counter part Liandry&#039;s Torment can&#039;t be used on as many AP champions.\r\nThis is another problem that items face here, how fitting they are to a champion and it&#039;s build and if the situation arises can you say &quot;fuck it&quot; and use it anyway.\r\n\r\nNow something that annoyed me a lot during the moaning and whining of the Tank Meta was that anyone who complained acted as if these items didn&#039;t exist, hell many people complained that Vayne was banned nearly every game, despite there being plenty of ADCs/Marksmen who are capable of shredding tanks reliably. (if not as ridiculous as she does)\r\n{{champion:29}} {{champion:203}} {{champion:96}} \r\nKindred while currently considered underpowered at this point, can utilise {{item:3153}} and an armour pen item like {{item:3035}} to make any amount of armour on a tank just be worthless. And as a Jungle she has access to {{item:1419}} increasing her strength against tanks further, though most find {{item:1412}} to be better on her at times. (Warrior was certainly the best option on her back when it was armour pen)\r\n\r\nNow looking at it like this shows that while people were complaining about the Tank Meta being boring and unfun, there were plenty of options to play against it and counter tanks.\r\n\r\nItems are incredibly powerful in this game, they have the ability to turn a bad situation into a good one.\r\nMost often when I see a Vlad{{champion:8}}  or Mundo{{champion:36}}  in a game I sigh in disappointment, most teams I get end up feeding these champions quite a lot.\r\nAdmittedly I&#039;ve struggled against them from time to time quite a bit.\r\nBut then one of my old favourite items was added back into the game.\r\n{{item:3123}} \r\nI fell in love with this item a second time when it returned, particularly on a day where I was playing Darius {{champion:122}} against Vlad {{champion:8}} .\r\nI went 0/2 against him pretty quickly and he because unbearable, forcing me into tower and causing me to lose quite a lot of CS.\r\nUpon buying my {{item:3123}} the lane turned around and Vlad ceased to exist the entire game, the sustain mage surprising can&#039;t do much when he can&#039;t sustain.\r\n\r\n----------------------------------------\r\n\r\nNow back to the current Meta.\r\nAssassins are back, and for the first time since the game came out of Beta ADCs/Marksmen are not the dominant force in the game.\r\nThe game is no longer centered on the ADC, no longer centered on the bot lane.\r\nSo of course, bitching must occur!\r\nADCs are getting killed so quickly that Supports are complaining they can&#039;t shield/heal/etc faster enough.\r\n\r\nSo maybe the ADCs should do something and change to fit the Meta instead of complaining?\r\n\r\nWhen I play ADC I like to take to {{summoner:3}} I&#039;ve been doing this for years.\r\nI never seem to use {{summoner:7}} {{summoner:21}} at the right times, and I just don&#039;t really like taking {{summoner:14}} especially if there are items that do it&#039;s job better.\r\n{{summoner:3}}  however is incredible, it might do TOO MUCH all at once, it slows attack and move speed, it shreds armour and magic resist by 10 points and reduces damage output by 40%.\r\nIn my eyes, that is incredible for an ADC to have, the dueling potential it gives, and the survival it brings against assassins is incredible.\r\n\r\nItems are interesting here as well.\r\nIn the same way there are items to deal with tanks, there are items that protect you, especially against assassins.\r\n\r\nThe first that comes to mind for some people is {{item:3140}} {{item:3139}} unfortunately it was nerfed pretty hard last year, which was a major buff for Zed {{champion:238}}  and Fizz {{champion:105}} .\r\nIt was quite a sad nerf, as a Jungle main I found myself using {{item:3139}} quite a fair bit if I could fit it, now it&#039;s rarely that efficient to spend gold on, especially with the high cost of {{item:3140}} and the combination cost for the final item.\r\n\r\nNow for ADCs we still do have a gold efficient item combo that can give incredible survival, especially against assassins.\r\n{{item:3046}} {{item:3812}} \r\nThese two items give great defensive and offensive bonuses to you.\r\nDeath&#039;s Dance slows down burst damage against you, while Phantom Dancer reduces damage taken from the opponent you are engaged to.\r\n\r\nOn top of this, it&#039;s important to TRY DIFFERENT THINGS.\r\nEspecially different combinations.\r\n\r\nThere is no progress to be made by playing the same thing every game and then just bitching that it doesn&#039;t work.\r\n\r\nHaving trouble against Rengar {{champion:107}} ?\r\nDid you know that Rengar players rage quit out of frustration against Vayne {{champion:67}} Janna {{champion:40}} combos?\r\nVayne and Janna just out right trash Rengar and most assassin&#039;s engage, if an assassin&#039;s engage is negated they wont do much damage afterwards.\r\nFor instance Rengar has no way to re-engage without a bush or his ult, if his leap is thwarted he dies quickly.\r\n\r\nChange who you are playing.\r\nChange your build.\r\n\r\n\r\nBuying {{item:3085}} every game on Caitlyn {{champion:51}} wont change the Meta, it wont change how quickly you are going POOF to Zed{{champion:238}} .\r\nBut if you think creatively, pick someone else, look at a different build, you&#039;ll make the best of the situation.\r\n\r\nUrgot {{champion:6}} is still a Marksman, he&#039;s tanky as all hell, with inbuilt armour shred and a slows for days with locking missiles.\r\nIs Urgot sleeper OP? I know I can go 20/0 on him.\r\n\r\n\r\n----------------------\r\n\r\nWhat do you think?","replies":[{"poster":"DarkShade918","date":"2017-01-22T07:32:46.537+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Representation of current meta\n\n\"What is an adc but an easy kill\"","replies":[]},{"poster":"CHEESYLEEKS","date":"2017-01-23T00:30:09.686+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Nerf all other role and items, buff support items to op status\n\nBring on the support meta","replies":[]},{"poster":"Gesteppie","date":"2017-01-21T20:39:51.852+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I think ADC's like to bitch a lot about the 4 man ganks bot lane usually pre- level 6 XD.

Recently I've been considering whether ohmwrecker/zzrot would be decent on an Adc because the statline isn't too bad defensively and the active could help you rush towers and the pointrunner movespeed would help you stay in kiting out the bruisers.\n\nBut I agree that itemisation against Ad is pretty abysmal at the moment. I mean I can understand why, it's the same reason why abyssal is pretty much the only magic resist option for Ap midlaners, it's too stop defensive itemisation in damage roles but I think it's high time adcs got something, or at least an item to deal with sticky melee assassins that isn't a goddamn Randuins.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Gesteppie","date":"2017-01-21T23:56:56.864+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"But why do juggernauts exist!!??{{champion:32}}  *sadface*","replies":[{"poster":"Valor Carrys","date":"2017-01-22T00:03:30.614+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The issue isn't tanks (because juggernaut's are a different issue) existing (Maybe minus the fact that poppy is OP as fuck, and colossus still needs nerfs) it's the fact that AD's don't have a nice hybrid defense/offense item against AD damage, and the best bet to stay in build is health.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Valor Carrys","date":"2017-01-21T20:37:19.223+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I stopped reading part way through to just address the ADC meta issue.\n\nThe issue that ADC's have is that they realistically need 3-4 items to be useful, and with such an accelerated meta, there is just no way they can do that, and it means they are almost always giving up an item for survivability to actually do damage (because your picking between survivability item and the last whisper items)\n\nThere are some champions that can get away with less items and still do decent, but the majority just can't, which has just caused the issues we have.\n\nAnd in comes Ziggs, doing the pushing that ADC's have to do, but needing less items, and spiking sooner, and right now, he is the perfect ADC replacement until the meta slows down.","replies":[{"poster":"Klavinmour","date":"2017-01-21T20:53:24.480+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Like I said in the first post.\n{{item:3046}} {{item:3812}} \n\nYou don't lose damage, and you gain a lot of defense.","replies":[{"poster":"Nightjar","date":"2017-01-21T23:19:14.363+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"Or go for {{item:3071}} against bursty ad assassins, {{item:3022}} against bruisers, {{item:3814}} against bursty mages, {{item:3156}} against kinda bursty but more dps mages, {{item:3072}} generally and for lifesteal, {{item:3139}} against cc, {{item:3153}} against tanks that somehow just got too big, {{item:3142}} also against tanks but also just good for chasing or running away, {{item:3053}} for adcs who use spellblades and scale off total ad and not bonus ad, also not a horrible item on high atkspeed champions, {{item:3026}} if you are really getting desperate against a really fed burst assassin. {{item:3157}} basically GA but feels better if you have ap ratios.","replies":[{"poster":"Essembie","date":"2017-01-23T08:35:22.089+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"So build ad as tank.","replies":[{"poster":"Nightjar","date":"2017-01-23T13:10:20.979+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"well I mean I once saw a tristana build {{item:3022}}{{item:3071}} {{item:3065}} {{item:3143}} {{item:3026}}{{item:3006}}   into an enemy team that had a rengar, yasou and fizz and she didn't do that badly.

Good job Klavin, take my upvote.\n\nNow onto the issue at hand:\n\nOne of the major issues I've noticed (and I must admit I'm guilty of this a bit myself) is that ADCs always seem to build \"glass cannon\", ignoring the need for any kind of defensive stats. It's not like the options don't exist, but people just seem to be flat out ignoring them because \"damage wins games\". That's not much use in an Assassin META, though. If you're not building *any* defensive stats, you're just going to get demolished by anyone that can reliably engage and burst or poke you down from a distance, and may even get out-damaged by Tanks (I've seen this happen a lot).\n\nWith ADCs building glass cannon, that means the Supports can't do their usual jobs because their ADCs are dead before they're able to react. With some defensive stats on those ADCs, they'll be a lot more likely to survive long enough for the Support to be useful and, hopefully, turn the tides of battle. When it comes down to it, people just need to stop b!tching, look at the things that are getting them killed all the time and formulate strategies that can help them overcome those obstacles.\n\nBut of course, that's not going to happen, because it's a lot easier to blame someone else (*cough* Riot *cough*) than to reflect on what you are doing wrong and work to improve yourself.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Talon12","date":"2017-01-23T12:10:53.885+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Whats this shit?
