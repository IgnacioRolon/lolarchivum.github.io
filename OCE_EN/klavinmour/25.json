So I&#039;m not having any stability issues here, I&#039;ve also talked it over with other players ranging from Bronze to Master and they too have seen or had these issues.\r\n\r\nSo first one, many seem to have noticed this one to the point it&#039;s been complained about a lot on the forums.\r\nMinions being cock blocking little shits.\r\nSo something was done to minion collision? And now minions are some ridiculous immovable wall of pure hatred that fucks you over and lets the enemy take advantage as if you were CCed in place.\r\nYeah okay, minion block ain&#039;t anything new, but it&#039;s been frustrating and over the top these past two patches. Why? There doesn&#039;t seem to be any NEED for it to be like this.\r\n\r\nSecond problem is with minions again, this time it&#039;s minions disapearing/dying when they shouldn&#039;t. I&#039;m talking when you go to last hit a minion at the right time and suddenly it disappears/dies when it shouldn&#039;t.\r\nAnd it&#039;s not only when a minion is in that perfect primed position for being last hit either, I&#039;ve seen minions that are at half health suddenly die when they aren&#039;t being attacked.\r\n\r\nThe third problem is also related to minions, but I guess it applies to champions as well, and really anything that you can target.\r\nQuite often I&#039;ve gone to last hit a minion, and instead the game interprets my click as either a click on another minion or a move command to stand next to the minion.\r\n\r\nNow the fourth problem.\r\nThis is skillshots.\r\nSo I&#039;ve seen many issues with skillshots these last couple of patches, and the problems differ from champion to champion.\r\n{{champion:53}} Has been landing Qs when the Q obviously doesn&#039;t come anywhere near the target. I&#039;m talking a miss of 1-2cm or even being out of range. There have also been instances where a Blitz Q will phase through minions and latch onto a champion.\r\nThen you have {{champion:81}}  his abilities will fire off a few degrees away from where your mouse is pointing, and this is very inconsistent as well.\r\nIt also seems that the hit boxes of many other champion&#039;s skillshots are not accurate to their visual appearance.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThere are more issues I have to mention, but these are the most pressing for now.","replies":[{"poster":"KingDinger","date":"2015-12-05T22:30:34.458+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"i get and have told EVERYONE about those EXACT PROBLEMS! but no one i tell seems to believe me!\n\ni also get mad lag spikes even with perfect ping, nothing open and insanely good net speed...like things just stop happening and then rush all at once...","replies":[{"poster":"Combilizer","date":"2015-12-06T11:39:09.124+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=KingDinger,realm=OCE,application-id=Ntey9fRZ,discussion-id=rN9fnGEs,comment-id=0000,timestamp=2015-12-05T22:30:34.458+0000)\n>\n> i get and have told EVERYONE about those EXACT PROBLEMS! but no one i tell seems to believe me!\n> \n> i also get mad lag spikes even with perfect ping, nothing open and insanely good net speed...like things just stop happening and then rush all at once...\n\nThe minion issues are most annoying, lets hope those are fixed soon. But yeah, in most games there is a player who will either be afk at the start or gets disconnected. It's frustrating. Sometimes your game will be on the loading screen and everything looks normal, but you are not in the game. Sometimes you black screen out.\n\nI believe that at the times when Riot updates the front page of the client, this causes problems. Also any small update to the patch (like a miniscule 5MB download) causes it for me. When you black screen, restart the Whole client immediately... this will return you to the game the quickest. Have some tool on your quick launch bar that can shut down your client from the computers memory, don't use the normal closing of the game, its too slow).\n\nFor the internet issues, here are some check points.\n\n1) Don't play on wi-fi.\n2) Reconnect all of your cables (thats modem, ethernet, and also telephony cables), especially if you have the old 600 series connections and not the RJ-12s. It may sound like nothing will change because the cables haven't moved or shifted at all, but this has worked for me in the past.\n3) If you have a home back to base alarm system installed, make sure your internet filters/splitters are in the right spots.\n4) Check with family or housemates if they are downloading , on netflix, etc, this will affect your games even though you may think that it shouldn't (Dyrus recently uploaded something to Youtube, which made his housemate TheOddOne's game lag to 1000ms ping).\n\nGood luck!","replies":[{"poster":"YellowBrickRoad","date":"2015-12-06T12:32:48.887+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"ive experienced the lag spikes he is talking about, you couldnt be further off.\n\nThe only way to describe it is like the server stops sending you packets for a few seconds or even 20 seconds, but its still taking input, then after it catches up you see everything happen in the span of half a second, let me tell you know if it happens in the middle of a teamfight the resulting sonic boom from everything being casted at once does not sound fun.","replies":[{"poster":"Combilizer","date":"2015-12-07T07:37:05.236+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=YellowBrickRoad,realm=OCE,application-id=Ntey9fRZ,discussion-id=rN9fnGEs,comment-id=000000000000,timestamp=2015-12-06T12:32:48.887+0000)\n>\n> ive experienced the lag spikes he is talking about, you couldnt be further off.\n> \n> The only way to describe it is like the server stops sending you packets for a few seconds or even 20 seconds, but its still taking input, then after it catches up you see everything happen in the span of half a second, let me tell you know if it happens in the middle of a teamfight the resulting sonic boom from everything being casted at once does not sound fun.\n\nI'm aware of what it looks like, but did you try my ideas/ solutions?","replies":[{"poster":"YellowBrickRoad","date":"2016-01-15T01:57:37.812+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I didnt need to, Ive been working with pc's for 12 years, i think id notice a technical problem when i see one.\n\nHeres the fact of the matter, the lag was serverside when it was happening,  the pre requisite for all the things you mentioned would be a ping spike, not a stable ping with server sided lag happening.\n\nYour tips do make sense if you are getting sporadic high ping spikes, but outside of that they dont have any place in the convo.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Jink","date":"2015-12-05T22:37:11.817+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"the minion block is sort of because they changed minion aggro so they aggro harder and that tends to make messy blocks and is basically unavoidable. They made it so they are placed a bit further apart and its not rlly this bad this patch, although you have to play smarter when last hitting as melee. Before they changed it I got minion blocked 3 times in a row assassinating a draven as yi and died as a direct result of the triple impede from melee minons.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Jink","date":"2015-12-05T22:35:22.060+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I have a problem when im standing to the right of illaoi and her tentacle smash still hits me.
