So i wouldn't throw all my weight behind it without further investigation and crunching the numbers.\nAs usually HP scaling abilities are very strong.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Broken Scripts","date":"2017-04-19T06:18:03.413+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Jesus, he'd be broken if his abilities scaled from HP.\n\nLOL!","replies":[]},{"poster":"Talon12","date":"2017-04-19T06:10:41.219+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Because his base damages are already ridiculously high.","replies":[]}]}
