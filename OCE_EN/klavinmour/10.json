His implication was that it would be at least a few games worth of recently, but as far as the notification is concerned it's about 5-10 minutes. I was under the impression your idea of recently aligned with his, as what you said also implied that you would need to consider more than one games of reports to find the one who got punished.\n\nHowever I must admit I misread your post, and understood context from it that wasn't there. I thought you were implying the notification itself told you something more than it does, so that's my bad for not reading it properly.","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2017-01-07T06:26:46.393+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It's usually one within 5~ minutes, so pretty much whatever last game you reported.
