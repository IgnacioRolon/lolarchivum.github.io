I can definitely say that it's very rampant. Although they have been much smarter now and would only cheat mostly in the champion pool. You can see the guy in the photo url have lvl3 Warwick so soon lol without using coins (i.e he hit 30 coin mark at lvl4). I also experience instances where 3 players having lvl3  kassadin at champion lvl of 5 like how is that possible if the champion pool is shared??\n\nhttps://ibb.co/t4t7jJk (photo link)!!","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2019-07-04T06:08:15.717+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I can't say I've seen (or at least I haven't noticed) any cheating myself. My recommendation would be to collect screenshots and submit to player support so they can be investigated. They won't be able to tell you anything regarding individual players of course, but if people are finding ways to cheat that's something they'll want to take care of ASAP, and the more information they have the better.","replies":[]}]}
