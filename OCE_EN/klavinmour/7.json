I tried Portal and this item has a lot of fun with proxy Singed...BUT in generally you find that Portal has no really place on proxy SInged's items (just like the Banner of Command which is very ''proxy'' item)\n\nMy build is: typical AP rune page with percent health seals, 0/17/13 masteries , Mercury's boots w/Distortion ,Tear of the Goddess,Catalyst and Ohmwrecker are my core items. I then buy Twin Shadows and i upgrade to RoA. For the final items Rylais and upgrade to Archangel/Seraph\n\nI would say that THE 2 SUPER OBSOLETE items for Proxy SInged are Ohmwrecker  and Twin Shadows.With these 2 items i can invade enemy Nexus turrets,disable them, pressing R and farm almost the 3 lanes!!! And with Twin Shadows i can slow any 2 incoming enemies  and run like hell out of the base! \nOP Sabotage Techniques!\n\nHappy trolling!","replies":[]},{"poster":"WEETBIX 4 BREKKI","date":"2015-01-19T14:48:07.262+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Singed needs pretty specific items to proxy effectively, I doubt you could budget the portal in without gimping his core items.","replies":[]},{"poster":"BarryButcher","date":"2015-01-17T03:41:58.021+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"LOL i thought the exact same thing. The thing is between waves your enemy would just go destroy the portal and it has a really long cooldown (150 seconds).\n\nSo maybe 3 or 4 hit the tower (if your opponent doesnt kill them) then thats it. They do chunk the tower hard though.\n\nWhat I want to see is the whole team rush zz'rot portals and 5-man push mid and see how fast they can do it.","replies":[]}]}
