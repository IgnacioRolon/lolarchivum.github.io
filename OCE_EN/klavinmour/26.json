But you can have new champions or reworked champions banned from Ranked play for the equivalent time.\n\nPeople playing new champions in ranked games outright promotes toxicity, either the player has no idea what they are doing as they play the new champion for the first time, or they are abusing some mechanic that is deemed incredibly overpowered and wasn&#039;t tested enough on the Test Server (which BTW is really only available to Americans) to have it reach the Live Servers in a healthy form.\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nAt this stage, in the current gaming scene there is no viable reason to not be restricting access to New or Reworked champions in Ranked Play.\nSo far this has only been done in LoL for the Professional Scene and Tournaments, and that&#039;s not good enough when your reasons for doing so are the reasons other games lock new characters out of ranked play for at least two weeks.\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nAnd just to add, I would very much like to see {{item:3057}} items become restricted in the same way as {{item:3077}} items, again you can&#039;t do one without the other.","replies":[{"poster":"SmolBunny","date":"2018-04-06T01:39:44.212+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"i agree with this i dont think reworked or new champs shouldnt be allowed in ranked ques for at very least 1-2 months because people havent learnt them yet","replies":[]}]}
