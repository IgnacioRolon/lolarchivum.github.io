Bro.\n\nWhy is it bad to take a game seriously?\n\nBefore I start. Yeah okay, I have my own reasons why I take games very seriously, I&#039;m 25 been playing video games for roughly 20 years, I suffer from mental illness with an inability to control my rage, I&#039;ve got a long history of playing video games across many genres.\nAs some on these boards have seen me say before I have played some games &quot;professionally&quot; though I &quot;retired&quot;/quit during Season 15 of UGC.\nI&#039;ve played in tournaments for StarCraft:Brood War, Unreal Tournament, CS:Source, TF2 and a few minor games here and there. I probably wont be going back into any team based games if I get back into &quot;professional&quot; play, but that&#039;s off topic of what I want to discuss.\n\nSo let&#039;s take a look at things from an Australian perspective, not just a gamer perspective.\nHere in Australia we have a long history of competition through sport.\nJust look at our international rivalry in cricket.\nWe&#039;ve always been extremely competitive when it comes to sport, no one ever questions this. But... sports are just games.\nThey are fun exercises that you do with friends, you just go out and play with friends, until you meet another team then it goes from fun to fun with competition.\nYou get super serious, everything is pushing against you for you to win.\n\nNow again back to me, I don&#039;t find sport entertaining, well I used to as a kid I played soccer. Such a great time, I was just as competitive and serious about it as I am now when I play StarCraft or League of Legends, or whatever.\nBut since then I&#039;ve injured my knees, lower back and right shoulder, my neck injury from birth has gotten worse. I can&#039;t be very physical these days, so I pour my heart into video games.\n\nSo I definitely have my reasons for taking games seriously.\nBut you don&#039;t really need any reasons to.\nLook around Australia you&#039;ll see people sitting at home watching the footy screaming louder and harder than any gamer does when they lose.\nIf you&#039;re going to have a problem with people taking games seriously, why don&#039;t you have a problem with this?\nHell the only people I&#039;ve ever seen say &quot;it&#039;s just a game&quot; are people who take sport super seriously and in twenty minutes are going to be yelling at their TV over a try.\n\nThese days a lot of people are making careers from gaming YouTube channels, Twitch Streamers, Game Reviewers, Horrible Game Media Sites that stir up &quot;controversy&quot; to farm ad revenue.\nSo why can&#039;t people be serious about gaming?\nWhat is so wrong about being competitive?\nEspecially on OCE, a large portion of OCE is Australia, and we are a HIGHLY competitive country.","replies":[{"poster":"ugotmunchies","date":"2016-04-19T08:41:54.378+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Nothing is wrong with it, but not everybody plays for that reason.","replies":[{"poster":"mlEIbc93h7","date":"2016-04-19T08:59:38.112+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"And that's fine but that's not an excuse for people to troll/feed or not take the game seriously in ranked as most people do","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Dr W","date":"2016-04-19T19:47:26.934+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"We aren't playing League of Real Life.

Theres nothing wrong with either view. \n\nHowever... thats only looking at from a personal perspective. \nCaring about the individual, but if you stop caring about the individual and look at the bigger picture. In a world view, computer games are very very very insignificant, they have been around for 0.0000000001% of our history on earth (if that), and have accomplished nothing great to speak of, and time spent on computer games (speaking productively as a species) would be far better spent on other things. Hell! if every gamer in the world had spent all the time they spent on games, on an actual building site, there would probably be no homeless, if everyone who played games spent their time in the production of food its likely that much of world hunger would be combated. (obviously it doesn't quite work like that, but you get the idea) \n\nA Scenario: Person X played computer games all his life, he was pretty good at it and even played professionally and died happy. Games were very serious to that person. So games must be important then, right? Well they were important to his life, but now we must look at how important his life actually was, as it turns out, not very. He didn't accomplish much, he went to school, he got a job, he bought his milk at the dairy, he took his kids to school he died a happy man etc. etc. He was just another very very small cog in a society that itself is just another cog in the history of that country which itself is just another cog in the current world status, which again is another very tiny cog in the history of humankind. So while computer games were important to him, he wasn't at all important to the world, and after his death there will be nothing left to remember him by, and if his particular very tiny cog was removed from the world machine, nothing at all would happen, the world would continue without slowing down in the slightest. Some cogs are bigger than others, Shogun Tokugawa, Adolf Hitler, Robert J. Oppenheimer, Thomas Edison. Either for good or bad these people changed the world for the significant future, and they did it because they went out into the real world and did something tangible. Faker will not change the world, Easyhoon, Richie M'Caw, Kobe Byrant, pewdiepie, cr1tical, will not change the world, not in the same way as the aforementioned cogs.\n\nSo asking people \"Are computer games serious?\" is pointless without context.\n\nContext 1: The importance of games in the life of an individual person.\n\nContext 2: The importance of games in the bigger picture.\n\nFor context 1, yes, computer games are to be taken seriously, that can drastically affects a persons life either positively or negatively. Play them to your hearts extent to become as happy as you can and improve your life with enjoyment and entertainemnt.\nFor context 2, no, computer games are insignificant, sure use them to amuse yourself in the time where you aren't doing something productive, but apart from that they serve no purpose. \n\nThe same can be said of sports, in 3000 years time when some archaeologist digs up a rugby post they'll all sit around and go \"wow our ancestors must have used this to communicate with their heathen gods, how quaint.\" and when someone digs up the old server bank that used to house the Lol servers, they'll tag it and put it in a box under their museum and that'll be what everything every lol player has done will ever amount to. People like faker while popular to us will be long forgotten before he even dies, champions in the olympics hundreds of years ago would have been heroes among their own people at the time, and now we have no idea who they are or what they did (and that was only a few hundred years ago).\n\nSo you already know your answer, and to find it you just need to ask yourself the question:\n\nDo i value the individual, or the collective?\n\nonce you answer that, you have your answer.","replies":[{"poster":"Klavinmour","date":"2016-04-19T15:56:46.097+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"Saying that gaming doesn't have any significant impact is pretty narrow minded, especially considering the last ten years.\n\nI myself find myself able to focus my thoughts greatly while gaming and have led to me producing better scientific reports.\n\nThen you can see success stories like RoosterTeeth starting to happen where they are beginning to offer a production service outside of Hollywood and it's bias and problems.\n\nUsing an example such as building houses there will be no homeless is pretty terrible considering humanity only works with a capitalist based society. There will always be homeless and hungry, nothing will ever change that no matter how far humanity moves forward.\n\nAs society isn't likely to crash and burn, archaeologist in XXXX years is again another bad example. If our species was wiped out, anything relating to us would have fully decayed by the time a new sentient race rose up, especially since any event to wipe us out would be either mass radiation from a hypernova or catastrophic collision with another space born object would wipe out all living things on the planet.","replies":[{"poster":"Lord Sesshomaru","date":"2016-04-20T00:49:05.516+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"That depends on what you mean by significant, significant to us as a species? then no nothing significant has happened through games, if significant means significant to modern day society, then yes it is significant, but then you have to ask how significant is modern day society? to humanity that has lived for millions of years. \n\nWhatever you use to focus yourself is your business and has no relevance, Archemedies discovered the theory of displacement while in the bath, thats a significant development for engineering and physics, but does it make the bath significant to human evolution? No.\n\nHumanity doesn't only work with a capitalist society, the aboriginal people lived for 125,000 years with relative success (until our capitalist society came along). Hunter gatherer society certainly isn't capitalist, and that was the very first society, without that we wouldn't have the modern day.\n\nSaying that society isn't likely to crash and burn is nonsense, thats like saying we have reached the peak of our evolution, the current day is just another set of dates that people in the future will learn about in history books, The Romans, and Egyptians and Greeks all thought that their civilisation was the peak of success, they never considered for a moment that such mighty nations would ever fall, and now they are just dust and ruins. Our civilisation will give way to another one given time, it may be a slow change to a better way of life or it may be a nuclear haloucaust, no-one can say. But it will not last forever thats for certain, and you're a fool if you think anything is permanent.\n\nAlso whoever said anything about our species being wiped out? Our archaeologists find many things now from cultures only a few hundred or thousand years ago, and a lot of the artefacts they have no idea what they were used for or why, and their species certainly wasn't wiped out. You don't need to be wiped out to leave little trace of your society, time erases all things, and you can be damn sure that the coding for our precious computer games (that already is pretty shaky while we are using it) will hold up far less time than the stone pillars of the ancient greeks. \n\nSo if our arceolegists find things from 2000 years ago and have little idea about what they are for, whats to stop archaeologists in 2000 years finding relics from our time and not knowing what they are for?\n\nStop thinking like we are the end of the chain, neither history nor evolution ends here, people think that we have reached the top and that civilisation will stay the same from here on up, well the romans thought exactly the same thing, and they were wrong as well. we are just another small part of history, its been going long before we came round and will carry on long after we are gone. \n\nSo in the grand spectrum of things, computer games have not accomplished anything that will be remembered for ages to come, and likely aren't going to. Computer games don't exist in real life, they live in this magical cyber world that we cant touch and can only access by sitting down and doing nothing, i used floppy disks when i was at school, i still have a couple in the garage in boxes I'm pretty sure, but even though i personally put some of their information on them, i now only 10/15 years later have no way at all of retrieving that information, so if i cant even retrieve my own information from 10 years ago, how likely do you think it is that people in 1000 years will find out that you were silver in season 5? or that Faker played Zed well?\n\nGames have existed for hundreds of thousands of years, since the first cave man threw a stone further than his neighbour. Lol and other games  are just the current version of 'who can throw the rock furthest' the aztecs had gaming arenas, Viking children played games, and now 1000 years later those games don't exist and no one lives to remember who was good at them. In 1000 years there will be new kinds of games and computer games may be just another small little bit of history that only a few specialist historians will know a little bit about.","replies":[{"poster":"Klavinmour","date":"2016-04-20T04:43:43.108+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"Again you use a terrible example, as the bath has impacted human evolution. Thanks to the cleaning techniques humanity has been using our collective immune systems have suffered somewhat.\n\nYou really don't show much in the way of understanding how this works when it comes to society collapsing and especially so when it comes to evolution. We've come to a point where the only way for our society to collapse is complete removal of our species.\nAnd 2000 years is no where near enough time for a new sentient species to evolve.\n\nUsing tribal examples is also bad, they are not successful, they don't thrive, they are not dominant.\nIt's only within a capitalist system that humanity is able to push itself forward and lift itself up, it's due to our war and violence loving nature.\n\nI don't get where you get your information from, but aboriginals have only inhabited Australia for roughly 30,000 years, and humans have not existed for millions.\n\nEgypt, Rome, Greece, they all collapsed because of their lack of understanding and ability to fill that knowledge gap.\nHell the Romans drank lead contaminated water thinking it was good for them.\nModern society we don't do anything like that until we know it is either good for us or has no negative effects.\n\nYes, okay we are going to run out of oil within 20 or so years and we should have fully converted to alternatives ten years ago. The people in control here won't let society collapse because they are late to switching over, they are smart, they want to get every last dollar they can from the last drop of oil.\nIt's just like in my field medical science, day one of university you are told to give up and dreams of working on a CURE for a disease, the pharmaceutical companies only want treatments that they can bill a patient with for the rest of their lives.\nBut again, that will be forced to change eventually, and it's not something that  will cause humanity to collapse on either side.\n\nThere are no things that can cause the collapse of society like what happened to the ancient civilisations, apart from major catastrophic events that delete our species from existence.","replies":[{"poster":"Lord Sesshomaru","date":"2016-04-20T08:11:34.900+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I think you're confusing 'the bath' a metal/ceramic bowl will legs. with 'washing'. you can wash without having a bath.\n\nYea i understand it pretty well actually, but you only think we have reached a 'point' because you live in this time, think back just over 100 or so years ago (so wild west times) how different society was then, (only 100 years ago, the roman empire lasted 500). yes the inventions of the last 100 years have changed history, but the inventions of the next 100 may well change it again. When space travel becomes more accessible and colonisation of other planetary bodies takes place, do you still think our society will remain exactly the same? What about interstellar travel, 100,000 years in the future our species on alpha-centauri (or whatever) wont even have the same society as It does at the same time on earth, let alone the same society as today. \n\nI was told that indigenous australians have been there for 125,000 by an aboriginal guide a few years ago on a trip to central Australia, but he could have been wrong, I'm not Australian so i don't get taught that stuff. Humans in their modern form that we know now have been around for 200,000 years but the origins of our species is thought to have started around 6 million years ago, the thing with evolution is that its not defined, where do you draw the line as what is 'humanity'? there are people alive today that are more different from the humans 200,000 years ago than the humans from 200,000 years ago are from the humans of 400,000 years ago. so yea... millions.\n\nAll 3 of those civilisations have been around far far far longer than our modern society, so from where I'm standing they are so far doing a better job (and they were never on the knife's edge of annihilating two continents like we were in the cold war). \n\nAnd you have to be joking... \"we don't do anything like that until we know it is either good for us or has no negative effects?\"\n\nIts not like 30% of the planet is obese (despite us knowing its bad), or the 560 million litres of coke we drink a day knowing its not exactly No. 1 on the healthy list. Not to mention that most people still smoke despite blanket advertising telling people how it does a fine job of killing you, how many people do drugs? What about the relatively untested effects of cellphone radiation that we ignore because of convenience. What about the tons of chemicals we pump into the atmosphere because we cant be bothered disposing of it in a environmentally friendly way. Our whole society is built for short term, like you say we mine resources dry, we kill the forests that keep us alive, we pump our waste into the atmosphere/ocean because its easy and cheap. So yea... obviously we wouldn't do anything we know is bad.. \n\nCatastrophic effects aren't the only way to change a society, change is gradual, mankind wont even know that their society has changed until they look back 1000 years from now and think 'wow we did it different back then.' The Vikings were once 'savages' on a small peninsula, and within a few hundred years they were ruling England, and they didn't even realise that they weren't the same society anymore. \n\nAnyway this isn't the point, the point is, computer games are serious when only looking at the life of one person, but when looking at the world as a whole they are so insignificant.","replies":[{"poster":"Klavinmour","date":"2016-04-20T16:57:25.508+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"The aborigines like to believe they've been here for 100,000 years or whatever because it fits their dream time scale.\nLooking through environmental and archeological data we find they actually migrated to the continent around 30,000 years ago.\n\nInternational laws have changed much over the years, back during WWII DDT was widely used until it was found to be extremely hazardous to the environment.

Wow.. i used to take you seriously, but after that comment about marijuana i just cant anymore, marijuana is a recreational drug that serves no purpose except to decrease a person's brain function, and i don't know about you, but i kinda value the brain, there are countless alternative pain relief for those few injured druggies that want 'medical weed' as an excuse to get high, my alternative pain relief for them would be a good slap in the face. \nsure it doesn't fuck the body as much as other drugs, but it sure as hell does a lot worse than not having any at all. 'but its better than cigarettes.' is no way of justifying using a recreational drug. Any affects it has on the brain waaayyyy outweighs any 'medical' applications it might have. I could argue until i reach the word limit for the boards on this subject, but i have seen wayyyy too many of my friends go down because of using this 'medical substance' for my negative view of it to ever change. I generally like to think i have a flexible viewpoint, but this is probably the one subject that i cannot argue objectively on, when you see your good friends turn from promising people to drug ridden useless slobs just because 'its not as bad as cigarettes.' your view tends to be bias. \n\nWe dont know everything about the vikings... or any old civilisation, for every fact we know, theres 10 other things that we don't. \n\nWhat about the dark ages?
