(BTW Riot Gragas still has a cigarette in one of his splash arts if you want to be consistent)\r\n\r\nSome of these regions either don&#039;t allow or don&#039;t publicly accept gay relations.\r\nSo does this effect League?\r\n\r\nRiot&#039;s official statement is that they want League to be available to as many regions as possible, that they want to game to be as fully accessible as they can make it, which is why they took away Graves&#039; cigar and spawned the shittastic meme.\r\nThis stand has irked members of the community from time to time, like when Riot standardized Skin Splash Art across all regions, taking away Karthus&#039; skeletal look and a few other minor events.\r\n\r\nSo knowing this, I don&#039;t think Riot could ever introduce a same sex relationship.

But maybe I'm overthinking.\n\nOh and, Shaco was confirmed a long time ago in the Journal of Justice days where Shaco stated himself to be an \"equal opportunity killer\" who \"goes both ways\", suggesting him to be either bi or pansexual, albeit in a twisted way (JoJ may have been deleted, but this fact probably hasn't). So it's not like Riot has to keep everything ahem quote unquote \"normal\" (and I use the term loosely). Again, they should take their time and develop more organic characters rather than just shoehorning them.","replies":[{"poster":"Wuks","date":"2017-04-21T22:27:24.574+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Literally the first thing I thought of was tokenism.

Doing that is actually more offensive to a culture/way-of-life than not.\n\nIt's like purposely giving a black guy a job over a white guy just to show that your company isn't racist, or to fill a quota. \nThat Is in itself actually a racist gesture. It implies that the black guy isn't good enough to beat the white guy on his own and needs the 'guilty vote' just to get a job. The least racist thing you can do is just pick whoever is best for the job no matter the skin colour.\nThe same is true of sexuality.\n\nPurposely putting in a same sex couple just to show that Riot isn't homophobic does exactly the same thing.\nIt basically says \"You're different, so heres something we put in just for you, so that you don't moan about us!\" If you just left it and let nature take its course, then thats the least homophobic thing you can do.\n\nIf a champ idea sprouts up who's kit lends itself perfectly to a same-sex couple, and that dynamic enhances the feeling of playing _(like the relationship dynamic of Rakkan/Xayah does)_, then great! use that to make an awesome champion! \nBut if you try to force-fit a champion or two to be a same-sex couple, just so you can say \"Hey look guys we are inclusive of gay people!\" Then not only is that a waste of a champion that could have been better used for something more fitting, it also is offensive to the gay community, and points out that we have to force ourselves to include them.\n\nWhat people don't realise is that by forcibly including someone, you are actually excluding them, and making the gap between you, bigger.\n\nImagine if your friends were only your friends because they 'had' to be, and would have been punished for being 'racist' if they didn't let you into their group.\nWould that make you feel any more comfortable? Or would it just make you feel more excluded. _(It certainly wouldn't make me feel included.)_\n\n_____\n\nSo while i don't think that the idea of a same-sex couple is something that could never happen _(with the world becoming more and more inclusive, it might well happen in the future when other regions ease up on their way of thinking.)_ But I think that unless a good idea arises that makes good use of that dynamic to enhance the game. It is pointless to even really consider it.\n\nThere is already a relationship in the game, _(and one that the majority of people can identify with)_, adding a second _(or something similar)_ just purely to include the gay community is actually an insult.  Its basically saying that \"there **is** a difference between heterosexual love and same-sex love, so we have to include both to be safe!\" When a real non-homophobic company would see that the love between a gay couple and a straight one is exactly the same, and so only bother to include one in-game couple _(wether it is straight or gay)_.\n\nThats my view on the situation, It doesn't directly answer your question though sorry, xD\nIt basically says, that we shouldn't even have to think about wether one is needed or not.\nWe should just let things happen, and if a gay couple arises then cool, and if not, then whatever.\n\n(I personally think that updated Taric was a missed opportunity to include some tweaked sexuality into the game, everyone views him as gay anyway, and riot clearly implied it in his quotes and manner, but why not just make it official and embrace it?)\n\n_(Also, cue the horde of people who misinterpret this post and slander me for something i wasn't even saying.)_","replies":[{"poster":"Klavinmour","date":"2017-04-21T04:56:15.755+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Oh yeah I didn't mean to make this with SJW sounding intents, but to open healthy discussion on if Riot can or can not do the thing. (I'm extremely anti-SJW myself as I've yet to see a single SJW who isn't completely and utterly lacking in any sense of logic or intelligence)\n\nLots of people want to see Taric and Ezreal officially be a couple, but Riot's already written Lux and Ezreal as a couple.\n\nOverall the question really is, will Riot change their plan to be inclusive to all regions, as in will they eventually say \"fuck it, these regions we don't care about anymore\".\nSince the ones I'm thinking of here, will NEVER change their ways, women don't have rights in some of these countries, and are essentially treated as a commodity rather than people. (funny how you bring up these countries to SJWs and they pretend like they don't exist and insist bullshit like manspreading is the most horrid thing to happen to women in today's society)\nThen you have other countries who while currently are anti-gay in their government, they have quite open gay communities, and the leaders in these countries can be replaced with more open minded politicians.\n\nWe know that Riot will never (and probably can't since they are owned by a Chinese company) re-introduce tobacco or skeletons into the game.","replies":[{"poster":"Lord Sesshomaru","date":"2017-04-21T07:02:40.280+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Oh yea, no I knew you were talking from a purely discussional standpoint and not a SJW one!\nI knew you wouldn't be into that haha.

Until either:\n\n1. Corporations and maybe even countries have to take sides in order to keep their existing buyers/citizens happy. OR\n2. No one can take the PCness anymore, it becomes too restricting for profits and other walks of life, and 'go fuck yourself' basically becomes the response to all social justice. Even from corporations.\n\nIf _(and likely)_ no.1 happens, then I believe that it is 100% possible for Riot to introduce a same-sex relationship. It'll have to cut its losses in countries that don't support the beliefs of the majority of its customers, in order to reduce flak from social justice sympathisers.\n\nManspreading?

While disabling a skin sucks it's kind of whatever, but disabling a whole champion for this one little cliche isn't really the best tradeoff.\n\nI think if they do explore such a thing, it'll be in a more subtle way (which let's be honest is the way to go anyway) whereby it's basically confirmed but not official.","replies":[{"poster":"Lord Sesshomaru","date":"2017-04-21T07:06:53.695+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"They disable the skin?\n\nBecause of a ancient piece of bad artwork, that even I with my inability to draw could still patch up?\nAnd it'd be even easier for those in the know to remove the cigarette from the model. \nThats actually pathetic....\n\nwow xD","replies":[{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2017-04-21T07:24:35.329+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I think it might only be disabled for tournaments, not sure on general play.
