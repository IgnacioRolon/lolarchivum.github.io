I think an ADC like Kalista would have not only been more appropriate for an underworld metal singer, but would have also introduced an ADC into the team _(because lets be honest, morde really isn't an ADC, no matter how much they try to make him one. And even in saying that, they didn't actually make him an ADC, all they did was make it pointless for him to be in any other lane)_.\n\nIm not saying Penta-kayle doesn't work, I think its probably the best skin of all of them _(although I am partial to Karthus)_, but the team would have been more useful _(or actually even been a proper team)_ with a real ADC.\n\nAs for Guardians... well.. who doesn't love that skin line!\nIm really into anime, so those skins bring two of my favourite things together, and that just makes the experience so much better for me personally. And so much effort goes into the skins. Even Lux is a good skin and that was before they knew they could milk it.\n\n\nAlso, I may-or-may-not listen to both Pentakill songs and Star Guardian songs when walking or at the gym <_<\n\n______\n\n#Favourites\n\nMy absolute favourite skin line is probably Star Guardians, maybe followed by Arcade? \n_(i like colours...)_\n\nAs for single skins _(not necessarily whole skin lines)_ my personal favourites would probably be PROJECT: Yi _(mainly because of the ult form)_, Eternum Nocturne, Cosmic Reaver Kassadin, Final Boss Veigar, Super Galaxy Kindred. _(and probably some others I'm forgetting)_\n\nBest splash in the game for me is 100% Pulsefire Caitlin!\n\nIn terms of **objective** best skin in the game, id probably say PROJECT: Ashe is the best bang for buck. The skin itself is pretty much on-par with Elementalist Lux, but it also happens to be half the price.\n\n_________\n\n#Dislike\n\n\nI also can't stand red skins, I dunno what it is, but most red skins kinda annoy me. Maybe it's because the majority of red skins are just \"Fire! Blood! Death! Hell! Purgatory!\" Etc, which is kinda a very juvenile theme and is way overdone and lacks imagination.\n\nOr maybe I just don't like the colour red? Who knows xD\n\nI think 'cool' when I look at a slick Cosmic Skin like Kassadin or Base Aurelion Sol, rather than when I look at a demonic fire-type skin like Forsaken Jayce or Bloodmoon Yasuo.\n\nThat being said, some Blood-moon skins are pretty nice, like Twisted Fate and Jhin.\n\n\n#TL;DR: \n\nBright colours > Red.","replies":[{"poster":"I Stealth I","date":"2017-09-14T05:04:10.182+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"***WHY NOT TALON??!!***","replies":[]}]}]}
