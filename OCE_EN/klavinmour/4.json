Is 10 seconds of complete lock down from knock ups that point?\r\n\r\nNow sure, I could have just had a bad game, my team played horribly true, but that doesn&#039;t depreciate the value of what I was observing.\r\n\r\nKnock ups are the strongest available CC in LoL, the only way to avoid them is to be untargetable or have them miss.\r\nTenacity doesn&#039;t effect them.\r\nYou can&#039;t QSS or other similar cleanse a knock up like you could a Silence/Stun/Root.\r\nWhile knocked up you&#039;re still vulnerable to being targeted by other abilities, especially ones that take a while to charge up like say Cho&#039;Gath&#039;s knock up.\r\n\r\nNow I always preach about having a solution or alternate to propose when you complain about things, such as when people complain about DLC or Micro-transactions despite the fact that games are practically sold at a loss as their price hasn&#039;t changed in like 30 years, yet people who complain about DLC and Micro-transactions only solution is more content for free.\r\n\r\nTherefore my proposal is to implement the same, or similar cool down system that MMOs use for unavoidable CC.\r\nAfter the first knock up reduce the effectiveness of the second, and then the third wouldn&#039;t knock the target up at all and the fourth and fifth act the same as the third.\r\nThis wouldn&#039;t mean that the abilities don&#039;t do damage, that would still go as normal.\r\n\r\n\r\nTL;DR I&#039;m butthurt about unavoidable CC and chaining knock ups together.\r\n\r\n{{sticker:slayer-jinx-catface}}","replies":[{"poster":"Z3npachi","date":"2016-04-07T05:00:03.368+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I thought that CCs already had reduced efficiency with each one stacked. Also to take so many champions with CC in their kit then something would have been missing elsewhere in their comp. \nIf they have used so many CC effects to remove a tank, then the tank has done his job allowing his DPS counterparts to do dmg. If a carry has been chain CCed then they were caught out and/or were not peeled.\nQSS and mikaels would have been useful against that and some sort of peel like janna/nami.\nAs the old saying goes cc wins games, but effectively stacking it on the correct target is easier said than done.","replies":[{"poster":"Klavinmour","date":"2016-04-07T05:15:11.606+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"In this specific instance all the knock ups were AOE, so they were chain CCing 3-4 members of the team.\nAlso as I said this game my team was playing particularly bad.\n\nAnd really you don't actually suffer if you have a lot of CC. {{champion:31}} {{champion:111}} {{champion:429}} {{champion:161}} were the champions with knock ups, so their damage output wasn't hurting in the least.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"JasonWazza","date":"2016-04-08T04:00:33.511+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":">despite the fact that games are practically sold at a loss as their price hasn't changed in like 30 years\n\nExcept now games are able to be sold to massive amounts of people rather than a few hundred people who actually play them, the gaming industry in the last 30 years have increased in the population buying them as well as the amount in games (Also the industry has made it easier to put things into games)","replies":[{"poster":"Essembie","date":"2016-04-08T04:07:57.636+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"And don't forget distribution costs have changed a great deal.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Klavinmour","date":"2016-04-08T06:09:49.856+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"The cost of making a game has also increased.\nDevelopment, production and distribution costs more, while the product's price hasn't changed.\nAnd we're not even talking about licensing of engines or music or anything like that yet.\n\nThis ends up not being much of a problem for an MMO or F2P game like LoL where players come back and spend massive amounts of time in a game, increasing the amount of money they end up spending on it over the years.\n\nBut for singular titles such as say Fallout, Mass Effect or Far Cry.\nThe game can struggle to meet equal balance at times.\n\nFrom an economic standpoint the price of a AAA game SHOULD be raised to $150 US.\nBut then less people would buy the game and more would pirate it.\nSo it's safer to sell the game at $60 US and roughly break even or make minimal profit than actually make the profit % one would make 20 years ago.\n\nDLC is incredibly cheap to make, because you've already got the licensing out of the way for the game, you don't need to worry about distribution prices.\nYou only need to worry about your department's tech costs and employment costs.\nEmployment costs go down as freelance programmers, bug testers, graphic designers all leave once the game itself is complete and done, normally it's only permanent staff that work on DLC.\n\nAnd I need to stop before I start ranting.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"fattyhotdogs","date":"2016-04-07T05:04:29.410+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"League doesn't have parties of 30 people running around gimping people","replies":[{"poster":"Essembie","date":"2016-04-07T09:25:12.981+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"not in game.\n\nBut I heard the drinks after OPL got a bit out of hand.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"A steezy Scizor","date":"2016-04-07T04:39:33.076+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"you can qss a knockup, sort of. it doesn't stop you from being knocked up, but it allows you to flash out of it, which then removes the knockup.","replies":[{"poster":"AdrAlpha","date":"2016-04-07T08:21:49.334+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"If your anyone with a mobility ability like {{summoner:4}}  or ez e or vayne q you can {{item:3140}}  or {{summoner:1}}  then use the ability to get out of the knock up early im pretty sure","replies":[]}]}]}
