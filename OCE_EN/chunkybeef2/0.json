It doesn't have to be a big event, could just be some custom games streamed on twitch, a community progress bar with rewards for reaching certain milestones, etc... (such as 'As a community get 100 000 kills on enemy champions' - reward 1000 koalas are saved) Additionally, why not make a global event this time around, instead of exclusively for OCE (like in the past)\r\n\r\nJust a small thought that would make a big difference","replies":[{"poster":"LRIG Tama","date":"2020-01-06T19:16:43.694+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I wholeheartedly agree!
