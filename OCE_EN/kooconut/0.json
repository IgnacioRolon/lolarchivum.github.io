(I will only ping)\r\n2. I either ping something once, twice, or 3 times.\r\n3. Sometimes I will type &quot;lets group mid&quot; or &quot;back&quot;.\r\n4. Every time somebody on our team makes a mistake, I type nothing. I simply don&#039;t care.\r\n5. Sometimes when I make a mistake, I type &quot;sorry&quot; or &quot;my bad&quot;, even though I actually don&#039;t care.\r\n6. If we get a few early kills and are ahead, I will sometimes type &quot;funny&quot; things to the enemy team in ALL chat.\r\n7. I prefer to group with 1 or 2 others (2-3 man premade). I don&#039;t like being in a 4-5 man premade.\r\n8. I prefer to take a tower instead of Baron or Dragon.\r\n9. I never encourage my team to do Baron.\r\n10. I play champs that are weak in professional competition games.\r\n11. I prefer to spam a single champion.","replies":[{"poster":"TO VALHALLA","date":"2016-05-02T04:40:56.112+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Whats up ghee holla at me im pretty good at jungle IGN: hi im bish","replies":[]},{"poster":"RelentlessLIVE","date":"2016-05-01T21:34:53.931+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"\"I prefer not taking baron or dragon instead turrents?\" That just makes me not want to play with you....\n\nDragon buffs are so crucial to end the game earlier and not let the other team obtain any chance to turn the game around.\n\nPlus dragon and baron buffs not only do they give each team player heaps of gold but they give you buffs to take down turrents a lot faster.\n\nLooks to me that each time you had wanted to take dragon or baron, either you've had some bad luck or youf decision making is horrible probably the reason why it put you off.\n\nGl getting out of bronze/silver :/","replies":[]},{"poster":"Wolphite","date":"2016-05-01T05:09:16.672+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Add me, looking for a reliable duo partner","replies":[]},{"poster":"EzeBlood","date":"2016-04-30T21:56:52.679+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Top laner transitioning to mid laner, Bronze IV","replies":[]},{"poster":"DUKE0","date":"2016-04-30T14:37:48.739+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I Main Jungle Rank, Silver V","replies":[]}]}
