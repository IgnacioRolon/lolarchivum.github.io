(I will only ping)\n2. I either ping something once, twice, or 3 times.\n3. Sometimes I will type &quot;lets group mid&quot; or &quot;back&quot;.\n4. Every time somebody on our team makes a mistake, I type nothing. I simply don&#039;t care.\n5. Sometimes when I make a mistake, I type &quot;sorry&quot; or &quot;my bad&quot;, even though I actually don&#039;t care.\n6. If we get a few early kills and are ahead, I will sometimes type &quot;funny&quot; things to the enemy team in ALL chat.\n7. I prefer to group with 1 or 2 others (2-3 man premade). I don&#039;t like being in a 4-5 man premade.\n8. I prefer to take a tower instead of Baron or Dragon.\n9. I never encourage my team to do Baron.\n10. I play champs that are weak in professional competition games.\n11. I prefer to spam a single champion.\n\n","replies":[{"poster":"Kooconut","date":"2016-04-30T14:28:55.107+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"bump","replies":[{"poster":"DUKE0","date":"2016-04-30T14:42:20.081+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"YES","replies":[]}]}]}
