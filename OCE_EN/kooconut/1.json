However, each of those 4 wins he gained LP while each of the losses his LP didn't drop at all.\n\nTherefore, his played a total of 23 games so far.\n\n(I think maybe on his most recent 23rd match when it was a loss, he finally lost abit of LP)\n\nRegardless, I'm just confused as to what's going on.\n\nIs this normal?\n\nIf it is then perhaps my account is bugged because as soon as I finished 10 games, my losses made my LP drop.","replies":[]}]}]}
