I will also redo the 2 champion concepts that I did on my other account (Danielw258... I was 10 shut up) onto this account, buffing/nerfing them and changing some abilities to make them better for the game right now. I hope to make many champion concepts cause it&#039;s pretty fun and I sorta want to join Riot and make some champions for League but I know that won&#039;t happen. As I said I will take suggestions to change the characters a bit if I think they&#039;re good. Aight you can read now. &lt;3 xD\n\n_**Ziba, the Last Warrior of Varr&#039;oza**_\nZiba is a fighter who lacks mobility but has extremely high defense. He relies on having bonus health in order to gain damage. He would be best in the jungle or top lane. If Ziba gets caught out on his own, due to his low mobility, there isn&#039;t much he can do. \n\n_**Lore:** _\nHidden in the Kumungu jungle was the village of Varr&#039;oza. The warriors of the village pride themselves in defensive combat. They learn much about being resilient in every fight and to never give up, no matter how hard the fight. \nOne day, a sorceress covered in plants arrived, she had a dark smile on her face as she slowly walked through the village. The warriors of the village were unprepared for the violent growth of all plant life in the village. The warriors readied their weapons and tried to cut the plants down, with no success. Vines shot up from the ground, skewering people everywhere. The leader of the clan, Ziba, decided to go against all he had learned of never giving up. Instead of dying, he ran so he could seek vengeance at a later time when he was more prepared. Rage unending, Ziba will seek out the plant sorceress until the day he dies.\n\n_**Appearance: **_\nBuilt like Trundle, frenzied because his village got slaughtered.\n\n_**Stats:**_\n610 Health (+65 per level)\n325 Mana (+40 per level)\n56 AD (+3.2 per level)\n0 AP (as usual)\n27 Armor (+3.5 per level)\n32 Magic Resist (+ 1.25 per level)\n335 Movement Speed\n0.658 Attack Speed (+2.5% per level)\n\n_**Abilities: **_\n_**Passive - Defensive Targeting:**_ \nZiba randomly marks an enemy every 6 seconds (prioritising champions).

After the channel ends Ziba gains a shield lasting 4 seconds equal to **80/100/120/140/160 (+10%/15%/20%/25%/30%)** of damage taken during the channel. Ziba cannot attack or use abilities during the channel. Ziba may end the channel early.
