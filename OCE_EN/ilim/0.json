People were understandably concerned that these skills would be used by toxic players to troll their allies. When I first saw these abilities and read the comments, I disagreed with these players. Mainly because I was relatively new to ranked and underestimated the frequency at which trolls ruin the game. Prior to League, I really only played FPS and the only real way to troll was to &quot;team-kill&quot;. This wasn&#039;t prominent because trolling in this way led to a prompt ban from the game, and a different player would soon take their place so as not to disadvantage the team. Obviously there is no such punishment in League right now so trolling is much more popular.\r\n\r\nThe precise reason for me writing this wall of text is that I have witnessed / been the victim of this abuse of a champions abilities more and more often in recent times. There are many examples of this.\r\n\r\n- Bard intentionally ulting me as I flee from enemies, giving them time to catch up to me.\r\n- Tahm Kench intentionally eating me as I leave base, and carrying me back to the fountain (4 times in one game).\r\n- Tahm Kench intentionally eating me while I clear a jungle camp, so his duo partner can steal it.\r\n\r\nThere are of course other champions whose abilities have troll potential (Anivia, Trundle, Blitzcrank, and probably more). The reason that these champions are not a problem to me is because they don&#039;t involve _taking control of an ally&#039;s champion_. You could potentially argue that Anivia&#039;s wall is similar to Bard&#039;s ult because it can impair allied movement, but it is a lot more situational and not as effective because the ally can at least flash or walk around the obstacle.\r\n\r\nIn my opinion, champions should not go to live with this kind of troll abilities. It is a shame because they would be neat additions to the game if only the toxic playerbase could be trusted not to use them to ruin another player&#039;s game. The abilities can mostly be modified so that the player has less control over other players. Here are some examples:\r\n\r\n- Allies caught in Bard&#039;s ult have the option to leave stasis, so they can not be frozen for the enemy to kill.\r\n- Tahm Kench&#039;s allies can choose to be eaten by him (similar to using Thresh&#039;s lantern) so Tahm cannot eat allies against their will.\r\n\r\nTL;DR Champions should not have abilities which excessivly interfere with the movement or control over other allied champions. These abilities have very high potential to be used to troll and should not be part of the game.\r\n\r\nPlease let me now what you think (especially any Rioters) and tell me any alternative ideas you have.","replies":[{"poster":"Zorphiax","date":"2015-12-07T13:41:51.936+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":1,"body":"•Allies caught in Bard's ult have the option to leave stasis, so they can not be frozen for the enemy to kill.\n\nIF the ally is the ONLY one in their THEN yes I think they should be allowed to leave BUT it would be stupid and you just report people who do this.\n\n•Tahm Kench's allies can choose to be eaten by him (similar to using Thresh's lantern) so Tahm cannot eat allies against their will.\n\nIn critical stituations SUCH AS team fights having to click on tahms mouth to be eaten MAY take to long and you will die so no I think that's stupid\n\n\nYou might as well just complain about anivia and say her wall should be like Azirs ult allies can move through it so they can't be locked in.\n it's stupid just report them if this crap is happening.","replies":[{"poster":"Ilim","date":"2015-12-08T05:20:39.520+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"Your point about Tahm Kench makes no sense. If that were true then people would complain that clicking Thresh's lantern \"takes too long and you will die\". Why don't we just make Thresh's lantern mandatory? If he throws it near you you instantly teleport to him whether you want to or not. No, that would be stupid.\n\nI always report players when they troll. But reporting them after a game doesn't stop them from ruining the game that you just reported them for. I would prefer for Riot to take preventative measures, rather than saying afterwards \"Oh it's a shame that guy ruined the game for you, but here, report him and if you're lucky we might mute him for a few days.\"","replies":[{"poster":"Zorphiax","date":"2015-12-08T16:22:54.146+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"What is in those dot points is what I'm quoting from you so when I said \n\"•Tahm Kench's allies can choose to be eaten by him (similar to using Thresh's lantern) so Tahm cannot eat allies against their will.\" I was quoting that from you.

Ofc it doesn't, there's no such problem with Thresh's lantern.
