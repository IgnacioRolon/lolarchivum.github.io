We are both Bronze IV this season so far but last season we were silver V but went down to Bronze I before the season ended. \r\n\r\nWe are both pretty versatile and don't mind playing any roll. I am especially good at ADC and Top, Oscar is also a good Top and Jungle.\r\n\r\nWe are in Auckland so if you are also in Auckland that would make our skype calls better.\r\n\r\nThanks, John","replies":[{"poster":"KindrÄ™d","date":"2015-03-26T04:24:05.330+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"HI.

I main adc. I was gold 2 last season but i've moved from mid to adc to learn the role. Since about 3 days ago i've started actually winning again! I'm already in a ranked team that I play on tuesdays (plat/gold mostly)- but i would like very much to play adc (or mid if i must) in another ranked team to just get more experience. Last season i went from B5 to G2 in 3000 ranked games and this season S5 to S3 in about 200. PLayed about 60-70 ranked 5's games since last season.
