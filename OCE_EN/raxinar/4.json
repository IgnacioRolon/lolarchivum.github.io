Im current in G2 when and I do play jgs a bit. I can still remember in one game i chose rengar jg verses shyvana jg, i ganked all three lanes and helped them all won their lanes. The jg shyvana didnt show up in the first 20 minutes at all but she still destroyed us by her full farmed items. This is tilting me so hard and i want RIOT do something on it.","replies":[{"poster":"Pa≈õserby","date":"2018-04-10T13:31:49.891+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I just hate Yis...","replies":[]},{"poster":"Raxinar","date":"2018-04-10T13:23:17.408+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"In my last game our jungler Yi never ganked ANY lane while their jungler zac ganked top 3 times in 10 mins, yet still i beat their top GP. after twenty mins Yi finally attends a teamfight and got a penta easily. It tilted me so hard when i compare it with my past games, carried the whole game and ganked all lanes finally gets a quadra and the fifth ran away. i got really disappointed with league of legends.","replies":[]}]}
