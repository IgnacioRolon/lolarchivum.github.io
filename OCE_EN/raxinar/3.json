Yes, we censor it because it's a huge security risk to your account.\n\nIt may not lead to say, your personal address, but it is specific information about your account. Any information that is unique to the account but not visible on the account is useful in proving ownership in the case of an intrusion. \n\nCompromising that information by posting it publicly, can mean that down the track you may be unable to restore your account because multiple people have identifying information about the account and original ownership cannot be reasonably proven.\n\nYou probably aren't the *only* player with those specific details attached to your account, but the chance of a stranger *guessing* that information about your account out of however many that may be compromised is slim to none, which is why Riot (which I am not btw) uses such questions to verify original ownership. The more of that information you publicly announce, the less secure your account is, and the less able Riot is to prove ownership and restore the account.\n\nThat information is ultimately removed for *your* sake.\n\nAs for your UN being taken, Summoner names and Usernames aren't the same (SN is the visible name, UN is the invisible login detail). It sounds like someone else probably has taken your Username, that is the unfortunate consequence of moving to global accounts. There will be some people that double-up.\n\nWith other Riot games becoming a thing it's much easier for all involved for accounts to be centralised, especially once games start coming to mobile which is generally not regional (at least as far as accounts are concerned). It's a compromise, but a necessary one.","replies":[{"poster":"Warlow","date":"2019-11-27T15:00:50.474+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":3,"body":"You sir, are a discredit to your organisation. \n\nThe information was not identifiable in any plausible way and you deleted it to mess with me, then hid behind a quote about protecting me.\n\nThe amount of money a player spends on his account is not personally identifiable, neither is the date they bought the game. A template email with all specific references emails and usernames removed was something sent to THE ENTIRE CUSTOMER BASE THAT MADE A TRANSACTION EVER. \n\n\nYou're an absolute disappointment and if this is the kind of rubbish grandstanding Riot empowers of their mods, it's not the company I thought it was.","replies":[{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2019-11-28T01:42:56.820+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"What? You mentioned specific amounts and dates, and key facts about your account that very few people share. All of this information, especially combined is unique to your account and is information you *could* have used to recover it in case of a compromise. \n\nPosting it on a public forum makes that information worthless for that purpose, and being information related to some of the key questions they use to determine ownership can drastically complicate that process.\n\nNo-one knows how much you have spent on your account unless you tell them. No-one knows the exact date you downloaded the game, or your first/early purchases unless you tell them.\n\nUsername and Summoner name are not the same, so announcing your Username on boards gives everyone who sees or looks for your post immediate and easy access to half of your login details. If you use the same password for other services as many do, getting the other half isn't that difficult if someone wants to.\n\nThere is a reason this information should be kept private, and ultimately it has nothing to do with Riot. No matter how secure or careful you are, compromise can and *does* happen, and in the event that you can't prove ownership of the account, is very likely to result in *permanent* loss of it. Why increase your chances?\n\nAnd for the record, **I am not a Rioter**. I am a volunteer moderator. I didn't edit your post to mess with you, and you didn't break any rules, hence why you were not issued with any form of punishment. The information was removed because it was dangerous *to you and your account* for it to remain.\n\nThe intention was not to mess with or mock, it was to protect sensitive details about your account that could easily be used against you.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Gehirn","date":"2019-11-28T03:19:22.518+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Despite what you may want to believe, Seras is trying to protect your account.
