INTENTIONAL FEEDING AND GRIEFING THE GAME IS MORE IMPORTANT THAN TALKING TOXIC. ive got trolled by a same player 3 days and kept reporting him, are you gonna do ANYTHING about inting players?","replies":[{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2019-12-12T02:09:58.174+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"There is a solid argument that toxic chat is just as important to remove as toxic gameplay. The system treats them both seriously but by nature of being different offences, the detection and punishment methods must also differ.\n\nThe biggest barrier is that intent is much easier to determine in chat than it is in gameplay. If someone tells you to \"kys\", the intent is pretty clear. If your jungler initiates a bad gank and dies in your lane, it's much harder to tell if it was intentional or just a bad choice.\n\n If you feel some key information is being missed in a particular case, then you can submit a manual report to player support and it will be reviewed. Be aware though that this method is much slower, and also doesn't inform the IFS (the main punishment system). You should always use post-game reporting where possible.\n\nhttps://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/requests/new","replies":[]},{"poster":"axeI","date":"2019-12-11T23:32:10.749+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":4,"body":"Fun fact - reports are not taken seriously from players who are gold and below unless under extreme circumstances including that of hate speech etc. Riot will not look into it via their instant report system because it is understood that low elo players have garbage mentality, poor quality games and don't have any gameplay knowledge hence them being a joke. \n\nYour personal frustration is your problem, it has nothing to do with other team mates on your side. If you're bothered by how they're playing - that's on you. \n\nAs for consistent inters, they should get punished. You may not receive the notification but if their pattern of inting games continues, then they will be gone. If you're not satisfied, take it up with Riot Support and open a ticket, have them investigate a certain player in particular.","replies":[{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2019-12-12T01:56:02.770+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"That is fundamentally not how the system works.

Money spent doesn't save you, it's more likely to get you banned as you'll buy the same stuff again on a new account.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Rallick","date":"2019-12-11T21:42:50.317+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"It doesn't ban toxic players either, we are all ignored together friend.","replies":[]}]}
