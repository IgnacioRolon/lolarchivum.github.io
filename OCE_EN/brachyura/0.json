In that time I have spent roughly $4,000+ on skins champions etc etc.\n\nPatch 8.10 came out and I decided 2 patches after that to give League a break and play another game for abit. \n\nI grew bored of Rust and sign in on the LOL Mobile app to message some old friends to see if anyone wanted to play a game.\n\nAs I login my name has been changed.... \n\nI then find out my account has been hacked, banned and had funds illegal spent from my credit card that I have not authorised.\n\nI have messaged riot and they can clearly see that it has been hacked and permanently banned due to there actions? \n\nYet claim that the ban is permanent.\n\nHere comes my questions.\n\nWhat do you think riot should do because this happen due to there negligence of account security. If I had have received an email saying &lsquo;a different IP address has logged in&rsquo; none of this would have happened.\n\nI would want either \n1. The ban to be lifted\n2. The champions and skins to be transferred to another account\nOr\n3. A full refund of every cent spent on the game \n\n\nIf they refuse then I would be more then happy to contact the ACCC and have Riot Australia contacted by a solicitor as. I can prove that I am not the person that was playing at the time, I can prove it was hacked, I can prove it happened due to riots negligence, I can prove illegal transactions AKA Credit Card Fraud, I can prove this happened due to riots many fault. I know for a fact that the ACCC would have a field day on this case, to me now it&rsquo;s just the morals more then the money as there customer service has been terrible. I can also prove I have not accepted there current T.O.S which in court will pull in my favour.\n\n\nWhat would you guys do in this situation?","replies":[{"poster":"Project Xayah","date":"2018-12-17T04:12:27.148+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I want to try and help with this situation, I'll try and explain some things to help you better understand how certain things work (where needed/requested) and I'll try to provide advice I think will be helpful. The first thing is that it could help if you provided more details about the situation, such as screenshots or \"statements\" pulled (word for word) from any tickets you've submitted regarding the issue. It's not required for you to do so, but it would help others understand the situation better, ultimately whether you choose to provide that information is up to you.\n\nSo the first thing is obviously to address the compromise and subsequent perma-ban. In doing that, I'd say the best way to address it is to submit a ticket to Support using the \"Recover my account\" option (you'll need to be logged on Support out to do so), explain to them that you believe the account was compromised (giving a time-frame for the compromise would be ideal) and go through the process with them. Normally, an account will be perma-banned during the process to protect from further compromise issues, though that's probably not wholly relevant to your situation.\n\nPart of that process is to confirm you are the original account owner by asking a series of questions, such as \"what was the first champion purchased\", \"what were the refunds used on\" and \"what location was the account registered from\" (things that other players wouldn't be able to find out just by looking through your profile on LoL or a 3rd party website). Keep in mind, you don't have to answer *all* of those questions, just enough to prove beyond reasonable doubt that you are the original account owner.\n\nOnce they have confirmed you are the original account owner, they'll start going through the process of determining the compromise period and *should* attempt to revert as many things that occurred during that period as they can, including any bans to occur from behaviour during that period. One *important* thing to note is that having a history of account sharing *may* result in the support agent deciding that they wont do anything, since that is explicitly against the ToU (and always has been).\n\nOne thing you might want to consider is going through your credit card history and identifying any charges during the compromise period. Once you've done that, you can \"challenge\" those charges and possibly get your money back for those instances even if Riot does nothing. In the event that the perma-ban does get revoked, however, that *may* become an issue, but I doubt you'd be worried about that at this point.\n\nI'd also recommend running a full anti-virus scan on any computers you've used to log into LoL leading up to your break. Personally, I'd recommend downloading Malwarebytes Antimalware and running a scan with that, it's a personal favourite of mine and certainly seems to pick up a bit more than other anti-virus software (in my experience). If you had used any public computers in the time leading up to your break from LoL, it's also possible there may have been a keylogger or some such device/software in place, in which case you'd probably want to change log-in details for everything you accessed on those computers just to be safe (though I'd imagine something would have already happened if that were the case).\n\nSo far as getting the ACCC involved, there's nothing stopping you from trying, but I'd imagine their response will probably be something along the lines of \"we see no reason to intervene\". I've seen a few people try to take that action in similar situations and get that kind of response. If you're serious about taking legal action, I'd recommend taking a close look at the ToU and Australian Consumer Law, and even considering getting legal counsel regarding the issue. Don't just try to jump in (you'll probably lose hard if you do), do your research, put together all the facts and info and get someone who knows how all of this works to look over it all (and get a second opinion).","replies":[{"poster":"brachyura","date":"2018-12-17T09:32:23.814+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I have spoken to them and they haven’t taken anything into consideration. They haven’t cared to ask any questions. I’m doubtful it will be on my end as \nMy pc is brand new and the only things I have installed are League of Legends, Discord and Rust.\n\nThey’ve basically taken the ‘to bad so sad’ approach.\n\nI’ve done enough research to know that the TOS are the same as Valves TOS and here is a case study we can use to see what would happen. \n\nhttps://www.google.com.au/amp/s/www.pcgamesn.com/valve-accc-lawsuit%3famp\n\nIf you have a read of a few statements said in that by the ACCC about companies operating overseas but thinking they aren’t obliged to follow the Australian laws.\n\nValve now have a 3 Million Dollar fine.\n\nI just want to speak to someone at support that’s helpful because it’s Riot’s fault any of this has happened. Why are there no protocols in place to say ‘Hey your logging in from a different IP please verify via email’","replies":[{"poster":"paul  b1art","date":"2018-12-19T07:21:25.003+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"This happen to a friend of mine and riot basically told him he was a hacker an they werent going to help him! he took a break because he moved house and DIDNT EVEN HAVE INTERNET! but yet they just sent him a fucked up graves quote saying end of the line and thats it!","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"QAPLA","date":"2018-12-20T22:21:40.545+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Lmao, trying to get money from 10 cent is like blood from a stone.\n\nIf this was original LoL you'd be looked after, but this is now Chinese owned \"fuck you consumer\" LoL.","replies":[]}]}
