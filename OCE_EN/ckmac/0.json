This post outlines how to create them (and many other effects): https://boards.oce.leagueoflegends.com/en/f/Ntey9fRZ/d/AHREUGPW\n\nAs for your punishment, there are a few things to break down here.\n\nTo put it in the simplest terms, you weren't perma-banned for that chat log. You were perma-banned for that chat log in addition to having received previous punishments (and their attached warnings that further violations can and will result in permanent suspension) that were ineffective in deterring problematic behaviour.\n\nIf this was a standalone punishment, then from my experience I would say it probably wouldn't have been more than a chat restriction. Your history is a factor in this as well.\n\nAs for this particular punishment, the entire log is negative. Some things contribute more than others, but there isn't a single line of positive or even neutral chat in a fairly extensive log. It should be fairly obvious that this kind of behaviour certainly doesn't create or promote any sort of healthy environment.\n\nOne thing that stands out in particular, is that from line 1 you open with negativity. Other people doing shitty things, does not entitle you to do the same. If you view their behaviour as wrong, then how would doing essentially the same thing as them yourself ever going to be right? In short, two wrongs don't make a right. It doesn't matter who started it if you join in and start throwing punches too, doubly so when you are dragging in other uninvolved people.\n\nThe other thing that stands out is the \"first time Senna\". In other words, not only did you go into that game with a negative attitude, you also went into it with an *intentionally* poor pick. In other words, you weren't really trying to win, which is basically the absolute minimum required commitment for a ranked game.\n\nIf you go into a game expecting to lose, then you basically guarantee that outcome (if only for yourself and your own lane). If you go into games with a negative attitude, you basically guarantee you will never have a positive experience.","replies":[]}]}
