But I just can't climb the ranks. My highest point was Silver 3, but then I ended up dropping. It seems whenever I go on winning streaks and gain some progress I soon go on tilt and end up lower than I was before. Currently Bronze 3. I have a second account that I somehow managed to get Gold 5 on by winning 8/10 of my provisionals. May sound weird, but why does Gold seem slightly 'easier' than Bronze or Silver? \r\n\r\nBut the fact is I just don't know how I can get this account out of Bronze. I buy wards, try to always keep my eyes on the map, I try to CS as well as I can, I am NOT a toxic player, I focus on objectives, most of the time I win my lane and if I'm ahead I go and try to help out my teammates. But I still can't climb. I understand the MMR on my account is minus.\r\nIs there some secret to winning the majority of your games? What did you high ELO players do? Can anyone shed some light? Reply here or add me in game if you have something to share :)\r\n\r\nBronze 3 accounts name is: Tea\r\nGold 5 accounts name is: The Bogan\r\n\r\nThanks","replies":[{"poster":"DrMattie","date":"2015-02-11T05:38:44.066+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Okay, at the end of season 4 I gold, but before I got there I was bronze 5. For a very long time, for me personally what got me out of bronze 5 was sticking to a certain champion and role, using this I figured out how I could carry the games eg. creating superwaves. Anyway good luck.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Maraudaur","date":"2015-02-11T23:06:35.014+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I have two tips for you to climb the solo queue\n\n**TL;DR** Don't focus on winning, Don't focus on other. Do focus on your own game, do focus on improving and learning from every game. If you can do that winning will come as a side effect.\n\n* What's the main point of solo queue for you? Personally for me its all about being the best player I can be. How can I improve and climb the ladder till I am happy with my current skill level? It's all about learning. How do I die less? how do I impact the game more? how do I pressure the map? how do I control vision? how do I do everything better? The focus is on myself. It's all about doing everything in my control to impact the game positively and learning what else I can do to impact the game more. If you learn and improve from every game and find enjoyment from that then win or lose it doesn't matter as much. As long as you're improving every game! Winning will come as a side effect if you have this mindset\n\n* One thing that has helped me the MOST in changing my mindset to purely focus on myself is to look at my own KDA ((kills+assists)/deaths) every game. Personally I have a mind set of \"If I don't get X KDA then I did not impact the game enough to win (I wasn't good enough there is more to learn)\"\nFor me right now that X is 5+, if I don't get a KDA of 5 or more I heavily review why I died so much or why I didn't get assists or why I didn't get any kills.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Sacharissa","date":"2015-02-11T05:51:20.270+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":6,"body":"I feel your frustration and suffering. The best solution to this problem is STARTING PLAYING RANK FOR A LAUGH. Trolling is an art, the more you troll, the more you can fill your heart with pleasure and enjoyment; a well-practiced troll master can provoke extreme emotional response still get away in tribunal. Trust me, it feels good!!\n\nI would suggest you stop thinking about climbing. Just sign up to a RANKED game, do your assigned roles, getting a good score (which helps when you end up in tribunal), and practice the art of trolling. \n\nPS. The most important point to note is that the point of trolling is to provoke emotional response from your and the enemy team without saying anything offensive in chat. Should you receive any offensive comments from someone, you should find a way to make him say more offensive language and slap him a report post game.  :D \n\nMay the spirit of {{champion:48}} be with you!","replies":[{"poster":"Exhausted","date":"2015-02-11T08:02:10.051+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"***","replies":[{"poster":"TrashDonnut","date":"2015-02-11T09:40:38.526+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Your stereotypical troll:\n\n\"Maybe if i troll, it might be fun. *First Blood* Hahahahaha my team is gonna rage!!!!11\"\n\nDo you know how %%%%ing annoying it is?
