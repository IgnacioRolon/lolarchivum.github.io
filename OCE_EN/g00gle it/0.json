These changes are well thought out . good job . Some things are still confusing but ill figure it out . At first i was shocked thought omg another disaster as last season was absolutely terrible . get 2 kills and thats it kill everything win game totally unbalanced no chance of getting back in game in a Normal solo que game (not a team based with headphone communication game ) .  After reading changes i thought jax irelia gone no more but after looking at mastery there catered for in ferocity mastery as ap was taken away from trinity but replaced in mastery to suit mixed ap ad like jax irelia. towers are strengthened again like it was in season 2 but a little better and no shield for char under tower xd . absolutely love the increased gold its one of the reason i enjoy this game when can i get next item makes it fun .always disliked a 2 item game  ( you&#039;re meant to enjoy the items mix match its exciting and fun ). The added crit could be lowered just slightly . As for mages a bit less dmg is ok (veigar annie lb 1 shot everyone its balanced should slow them up to mid game or jungler sacrifice a buff nice job )but mana needs increase as you did with fizz ,mages always mana starved . Love the minions extra gold makes game more fun full build not quater build xd .\r\nOnly don&#039;t agree with minions push and add more dmg when you advantaged already . make difficult for enemy team to get back in game . last season was horrible and even competition you could see it once they got 2 3 kills its was over barely any team got back in game it was all 1 sided and boring . every game was lopsided 10 kills to 1 or 13 kills to 2 . every team found it hard to get back in game . when you have advantage why give a bonus advantage doesn&#039;t work . The exciting games where watching moscow 5 come back from being 5 AND TO 5 AND 5 not 5 and 0 to 15 and 0 . boring . comebacks were biggest cheer . BUT  overall balance is best its been . bring tanky support back to game like alistar stops xin supports etc . well done riot well done .","replies":[{"poster":"Disciprine","date":"2015-11-12T12:00:29.193+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"I went to read that. \n\nThen I got tired and decided it would be easier to log in and tell you you need to work on punctuation and general post structure. \n\nThanks.","replies":[]},{"poster":"zee artificer","date":"2015-11-12T13:43:48.314+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I don't want to be 'That guy' but your post is hard to read.

Even with the new baron spawn buff, it increases the attack speed of the minions but they have no bonus to defensive armor/health stats so you can still waveclear them down... and in light of hybrid champions receiving somewhat of a lift in this season I think we'll see jax rise to the challenge of turning some games around and also the game was always about running ever rune/mastery to give an early advantage but I could see the new crit lifesteal mastery being somewhat of a nest egg strategy, while saying that I still think its a trap mastery in the solo queue as I think lategame strats require a whole team to be based around it and most people don't have the game knowledge/patience to work around such a strategy.","replies":[]}]}
