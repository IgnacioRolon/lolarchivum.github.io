Firstly thank you Riot for letting me participate in the alpha testing! :)\r\n\r\nI am actually in Italy at the moment on a sneaky holiday (and just got the acceptance email) so I&#039;m sitting in Rome among some of the most ancient and beautiful buildings in the world, and right now just can&#039;t wait to go and play league xD\r\n\r\nI won&#039;t be able to actually start the alpha testing until I get back in a week, so I was wondering if anyone would be kind enough to fill me in on some of the main points of interest and issues that are currently circulating, so that when I get back and jump into testing, I&#039;m aware of some of the issues and am not posting feedback about things that have already been discussed while I was away.\r\n\r\nThanks :)\r\n\r\nlook forward to working with everyone and trying to nut out the alpha client :)\r\n\r\n{{champion:268}} {{champion:136}}","replies":[]}
