So I decided to try out ranked where there are a lot of people who play the game properly and listen to there team mates. But some guy took the game too seriously and honestly this is just low. Doing this over the internet. I was playing as the Shen this game, and the Vayne was just disgusting.\n","replies":[{"poster":"IMAFIRINMAHLAZER","date":"2015-04-09T02:23:26.699+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Naming and shaming is against the Board rules. What you need to do is report the player in game and send in a support ticket with this screenshot as evidence. Reporting in the game will only work if they get repeat reported, but sending in a support ticket will more than likely result in direct consequences. Just say you were really upset about the experience and that it has diminished your interest in the game. Riot wants players to be happy, because happy players buy more RP :D","replies":[]},{"poster":"Saldean","date":"2015-04-08T13:48:36.866+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Your evidence is the screenshot right there, if you think that the player needs to be reported for his behavior in game then report this to the riot support service including that screenshot you have to use as evidence for the reason you are reporting the player.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Homura Akemi","date":"2015-04-08T09:00:52.687+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"such is this server. embrace it and get over it","replies":[]}]}
