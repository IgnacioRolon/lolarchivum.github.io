So I wouldn't shit talk them.\n\nMy very first season I got placed silver 2, fell to my true elo silver 3, and spent most of that season stagnating in the average rank, silver 3.\n\nIt took me about a season to improve and climb to gold where I've lazily decided to stay, but I don't think nowadays me, so many years later, is sufficiently better than first timer me, to the point where I could shit talk myself.\n\nAsk yourself, are you really much better now at league, than when you were fresh faced and doe eyed. Since unless you actively worked to improve, I'd argue probably not.\n\nAlso just generally, don't pick on new players, everyone starts from somewhere, and ranked is as good a place to start as any, since ranked is a very effective learning tool, since unlike normals or bot games, it quickly places you in an appropriate skill bracket that adjusts dynamically as you improve.","replies":[{"poster":"Pesquire","date":"2019-06-12T00:17:47.883+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"[REMOVED - [REPORTING OTHER PLAYERS](http://boards.oce.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/announcements/BjArMH2B-boards-universal-rules)] how to carry level 34 adc with 32cs at 27 mins? Doesn't leash jg. instead goes to give first blood within the first 2 minutes to enemy bot lane. Died 8 times with his premade (total of 15 deaths within the first 15~20 mins). Lost tower at around 10 minutes into the game and then continue to fail at 'afk farming' (because 32cs at the end). Please tell me how you climb if you get these c.unts not once, not twice but 3-4 times each night? Fuck you and your elitist comments, it must be nice getting into silver 2 right away. I guess you never had to try to solo queue as an unranked bronze back in the days when there were no tutorials on how to cs, wave management or objectives priority and team fight strategies and you had to figure everything out yourself? Oh and yes, I am a hundred time better than the me in 2012 when I first started playing this game. At least back then i had the decency to practice with bots first before i start playing in normal or rank when learning a new champ. These days you get c.unts who can't even cs goes in normal and rank because yolo. \n\nHere's another on the same night... [REMOVED] I meant split pushing+ not slipting pushing in the jpg. \n\nHere's another [REMOVED] finally got a gold 4 on my team... an M7 y'assuhole mains who goes 4-31 running down the lane but refused to surrender. don't know what his problem was... maybe he was frustrated with the matchmaking in rank? At least i got to try a different garen build... :)\n\nHere's another one [REMOVED]... teemo called adc, so I checked oce.op.gg because I am a M7 Teemo and knows how hard it is to adc with him in bot lane against longer range adcs. Stats: Lvl 21 20% winrate, premade with gold 3 LB. I didn't want to dodge because why should I get timeout penalty when others are trolling? So i troll support with my 2nd time aniva. Had the most fun this game learning to play anivia instead of trying to win. In the end gold 3 LB wasn't able to carry because teemo was useless under mf's ult mid and late game despite us winning early game. Anyway the moral of the story is yolo, just be as heavy as you can be and lose the game deliberately, that way you don't feel like shit when others let you down. \n\nI feel so much better now... Looking at the above matchmaking images has put a smile on my face. This is the joy of solo queue in 2019 if you can understand the humour. Only Riot matchmaking can create such a toxic environment where a reasonably 'normal' person is brought to their wit's end and become a troll. \n\nThese are all normal games examples... so I can imagine how shitty the author of the original post must feel if he is trying to win in rank and get level 30s in his team. Stop trying to be politically correct. Stop being so high and mighty, judging others from your lofty gold rank. How about pushing for a better gaming experience for everyone instead? I am sure the lvl 30 adc with 27cs feels like shit to lose to a bronze or silvers adc main too.. why do you force him into such predicaments? \n\nSince there are supposedly millions of LOL players, how about DON'T match players who are 100+ levels below or above you into your game? I don't mind the wait time. I am waiting on average of 3~4 mins each game anyway (and then waste another 20~30 mins of my life because delusional people thinks they can carry a 4v5 game with enemy team fed as fuck). \n\nHow about NOT matching a team of bronze/unranked against a team of gold and plats? It's very simple, no? I can give you a shit load of evidence of this too, just check the last 100 games of my OPGG. It's so bad, that most of the time i just dc at the start so my team can remake at 3mins... and those with enough bad experiences thank me for it too. It's a complete waste of time because you don't learn anything when you or your bronze teammate get outplayed by a gold rank enemy over and over. Vice versa, there is no joy or anything to feel proud of when you get carried by a gold/plat on your team easily defeating a bronze and silver team. So this year, not only have I become a troll I have also become a game dodger all thanks to shitty programming. I have also notice that I am a lot more toxic in chat. I have nothing against new players - just dont fucking put them in my games. Let them play and learn amongst themselves. I don't like being toxic, I don't like trolling, I don't like dodging unfair matchup but I do because of consistent bad matchmaking.\n\nHow about working toward a better solution instead of laughing at a player (saying he's low elo therefore, he is just as bad and his opinions doesn't count) when he point out the fatal flaws of your game? You know it's bullshit when you said you have not improved since you where silver 3. You know you are lying when you say a level 30 who has played for a few weeks is just as good as a bronze 1 who has struggled for years to learn most of the champs in the game... unless you are thinking of those level 30 smurfs playing their alts to boost their friends/clients. Man I have been tempted to pay someone to boost me out of elo hell so many times this year - once again not something i want to do... but might have to resort to. \n\nI honestly wasn't going to comment because i know how futile it is and a lone bronze player has no say in this game. But reading your comments really pisses me off. It hurts to see my favourite game slowly going down the drain, while everyone just accept it as is, instead of thinking of how much better and fairer it could be.

My advice. \n\nA) team up with another competent person that you discover whilst doing ranked.\nB) don't rely on your team and incorrectly assume they know how to play - you need to ping and type in chat and call out objectives\nC) Dodge bad matchups. Use OP.GG or Blitz.GG and see what your team win rate is, if it really is a 15% win rate jungler or 20% win rate mid laner and you are a 60% win rate person and they are picking a teemo ADC or a J4 mid then dodge and save yourself the waste of time and stress as we all know you are not here to carry people who should stay in Iron/Bronze/Silver).\n\nD) Next don't flame in game. If you flame either someone will quit and then it's 4v5 or they run down their lane and suicide. Better to have a player who is incompetent and alive for team fights so there is at least another health bar to get whittled down before you).\n\nE)  if you encounter people who are rude/inflammatory then use the /Mute *player name* and turn off their pings since nothing they will say will be constructive. And just try to play around the other 3 more competent players.\n\nF) if you are having a bad day in game... stop. Don't keep playing. Do something else have a breather, relax, eat some food, go for a walk, listen to some comedy, come back to the game later when not tilted as when tilted your own performance is effected and you will lose more games.\n\nG) Finally, recognize that you are not perfect either. I am a Lux main who gets S rank most games. This means absolutely NOTHING. My KDA is 4.5 again this means absolutely NOTHING when it comes to team fights. Don't get arrogant and DON'T GIVE UP. You can have a team that is TERRIBLE in early game and feed their jungler like crazy only to catch up to the enemy late game with either better comp or better gameplay or better vision or better map mechanics/wave control and win. All it takes is one good team fight for you to turn around and with the extended 45 second death timer push for a quick win 2v5 win.\n\n\nI would like to add, this is advice even I need to try to keep in mind. It takes practice just as playing a game also takes practice.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Lavish","date":"2019-06-10T06:16:19.001+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"what, low bronze?
