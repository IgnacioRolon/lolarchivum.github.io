I played 2 games on Friday the 31st and have since been off it. In my first game back I wanted to play amumu jungle and thankfully got it. I made sure to tell everyone about me not being on since March and how I most probably will end up feeding. Mind you I&#039;ve never been that great at league but double that with me being off for so long and you got yourself a fed enemy and weak jungle pressure and they were fine about it. we lost pretty badly and thankfully I wasn&#039;t the only one who fed in that game. then bring on the second game and I went as my main udyr jungle and did pretty well the whole game. we ended up winning and throughout it I was vocal on teamwork, warding, and objectives. After the match I did the usual &quot;GG WP was fun guys&quot; message and hopped off and have remained off since then due to me being too busy. Now I come home today looking forward to playing and have received a fat 20-minute ban for no reason. No message or explanation just a ban that I have no idea got there. I sent a ticket but it keeps coming back with an error and won&#039;t let me send one. Is there any riot help in this section I could get? It would be much appreciated.  Sorry for the long rant. \r\n\r\nTLDR: Been off since March, played 2 nontoxic games then hopped off for 2 days and came back to a 20minute ban.","replies":[{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2018-09-02T10:09:25.367+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Assuming you mean the 20 minute timer you have to wait out before you can enter queue, it's a punishment for afk/leave behaviour as Morgana has mentioned, and unless it was applied in error (i.e you didn't leave any games) will not be removed under any circumstances, To receive a 20 minute LPQ you have to have a substantial history of leaves, or a lot of leaves in a short period of time *and* you have to have already played through a 5 game five minute low priority queue, then a 10 minute, then a 15 before landing on 20.\n\nUnless there are some other shenanigans going on with your account as a result of compromise or account sharing, this LPQ should not have come as a surprise. \n\nIf you feel the LPQ was in fact applied in error then support is still your best bet.

If so, you get this by leaving/AFK'ing in games, after a few continuous times you will be placed into low priority and you'll have to wait for 20 minutes before queuing into a game (this will occur 5 times until there are no low priority queue left).\n\nUsually Rioters are not able to help out in the forums (specific volunteers that have green usernames are the most help you'll get here), so your best bet is to keep trying to submit a ticket to support (make sure to evaluate what happened as much as possible). In saying that, Riot will very rarely remove your low priority queue when its a problem on your end (such as lag, crashes or an IRL emergency), they only really remove it when its a problem on their end (such as server problems etc).\n\nHead on over [here](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/requests/new) (https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/requests/new) to submit a support ticket, ensure you login to your account first.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Honeyman","date":"2018-09-02T01:39:23.284+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I have been previously 20 minutes banned for toxicity and take full responsibility for that but am wondering why I have received this one.","replies":[]}]}
