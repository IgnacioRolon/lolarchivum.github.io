On top of allowing players that spent money on content to keep the content. In fact this would mean you could immediately re-activate perma banned accounts and in fact earn more money as people continue buying out the rest of their collection. \r\n\r\nEverybody wins. \r\n\r\nIs this even on the table for discussion?","replies":[{"poster":"Fitzky","date":"2017-07-27T03:26:50.373+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I don't necessarily agree with what is being suggested here but what I am angry about is the fact that people just downvote stuff like this without actually providing any sought of discussion or opinion. This guy here is suggesting an idea and wants people to talk about it but instead people are just skimming through it, saying \"nah he's a fucking idiot\", downvoting, and moving on. You wanna provide some context? You wanna actually contribute to the conversation? This is a place of discussion not a voting contest for gods sake.","replies":[{"poster":"dogol the dogol","date":"2017-07-27T04:05:12.131+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thanks, exactly. \nI'm merely proposing that in order to keep all the \"unwanted players\" from hating Riot and wanting to sue them after they've spent money, that all those delightful cultured people be put in a playlist amongst themselves. They can't do any harm if after saying just \"one\" of the checked words they agreed to never say, they're put in a playlist with people just like themselves. I literally think this would actually make Riot more money and would mean both innocent and cultured players would be happy. \n\nWhat possible harm could putting them in a group to play amongst themselves do? Instead of actually leaving League and going to another game, they would be free to trash talk til their hearts are content and thus likely to spend more money on skins and what not.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"dogol the dogol","date":"2017-07-27T01:51:22.569+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Vote down with no discussion. Typical example of what I'm suggesting. Make the people afraid of discussion have their own \"secure safe space\" playlist that aligns with \"competitive competition rules\". This allows the rest of us to enjoy the game as regular people.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Roguestoney","date":"2017-07-27T02:42:26.142+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":2,"body":"You're a moron buddy ðŸ˜‰","replies":[]}]}
