To obtain the Unchained Alistar skin for subscribing to the League of Legends YouTube channel, please [**submit a ticket to Riot Games Player Support**](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us)! As you submit your request, here are some tips that will reduce the amount of time before you join the Rift with your new Alistar skin! \n\n1. Create an account on the Riot Games Support website. It'll save you a lot of time in the future and keep your requests organized and easier to find/access. \n2. Be sure to submit as much information in your initial ticket as possible. For obvious reasons, each Player Support Specialist's request for more information will delay the resolution of the issue.\n3. Be respectful and polite in your correspondences with Riot Support. (They're doing their best to help you!)\n4. Try not create a new ticket or respond to an existing ticket before a Player Support Specialist has had the chance to review your request. New tickets/replies may bump your ticket back to the bottom of the queue, thus increasing the amount of time before a Player Support Specialist is able to review your ticket.  \n\n**If you're unsure where to put your ticket in, just select:**\n[*I have a question about League of Legends/Riot Games.*] > [*Game and Features*] > [*General Questions*]\n\nIf you have any additional questions, please let me know. Good luck!","replies":[{"poster":"Mithog","date":"2015-11-22T13:19:12.395+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thanks sorry for late reply.
