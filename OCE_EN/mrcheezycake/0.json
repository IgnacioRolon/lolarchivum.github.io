I just want to know if the problem is them or Riot servers.\r\nI am on cable and a wired connection, I have tested with wifi on the router disabled and no other machines connected as well as ensuring no other application was running and using the internet.\r\n\r\nThanks.","replies":[{"poster":"SephirothSG","date":"2016-09-25T00:08:25.926+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey there,\n\nCould you do the following for me;\n\n* [Download WinMTR](https://sourceforge.net/projects/winmtr/files/WinMTR-v092.zip/download) and run a traceroute to the following IP.
