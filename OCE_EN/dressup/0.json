Every game, or every second game, is a complete waste of time because of mismatched crappy bot teams. FIX THE BOTS OR LET PLAYERS QUEUE AGAINST PLAYERS. I have had enough of this ARAM losing every game because my team had 2 X 1/19/3 bots against my opponent team with no bots, or just 1 bot. That literally decides the game as soon as you enter matchmaking.
