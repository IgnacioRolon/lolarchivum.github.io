I want to play fizz, nidalee, rengar, zed, maybe some other stuff. Leveling my account right now so most of these champs aren&#039;t unlocked haha. \r\nI&#039;m also currently unranked, so if you&#039;re looking for someone to teach and help improve, all while hopefully beating other teams and climbing ranks then message me on discord @ spilo#0911. \r\nThank you!\r\n:)","replies":[{"poster":"NIghtshadowb","date":"2018-03-20T02:45:15.116+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"This is Oce....","replies":[]},{"poster":"Best Evelynn OCE","date":"2018-03-20T01:00:54.236+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Go to the NA Boards... we're sick of all you Americans being unable to read which Board you're on!\n\n{{sticker:sg-lulu}}","replies":[]}]}
