I'm thinking it might be related to how a bunch of people currently can't log on to the servers. If that's the case then you can just wait it out; it'll be fixed.\n\nIt's not likely your ISP, Telstra have a generally good reputation. It's TPG and Dodo you need to watch out for.\n\nSo, for the moment, don't upgrade your graphics. Reset your computer, connection and everything relevant. Make sure your DNS is set manually, clear your caches and set your Internet Explorer settings back to default (then set security to low). We need some time to see what's causing this exactly.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]}]}
