The amount of rage quitting abuse and down right nastiness of some of the players is driving me mental! RIOT something has to be done! I love lol but recently im leaving the game feeling angry and abused! Even when I carry the team people still raging at each other. might have to leave League of legends how many friendly players do you have to lose before something is done :(","replies":[{"poster":"Maraudaur","date":"2015-01-07T22:48:38.997+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey Zximo,\n\nSorry you had to go through a negative experience in your game, no one should be abused in our game. We are doing a lot of things to improve the player behaviour in our game, the Tribunal was a big part of that but right now it is down as we make it even better. No region has the Tribunal at the moment, but don't think that just because there isn't a tribunal that nothing is being done!\n\nRight now we have multiple automatic systems in place to punish negative behaviour; for example\n\n**Live**\n\n* LeaverBuster\n* Chat restrictions\n* Intentional feeder bans\n\n**Currently testing** \n\n* Verbal abuse bans\n\nThis is of course just the negative stuff, we are also working on ways to promote and recognize positive play within our community as well!\nhttp://oce.leagueoflegends.com/en/news/game-updates/special-event/celebrating-end-years-snowdown\n\nOur player behavior philosophies include punishment, reform, and positive reinforcement. There's no silver bullet to improving player behavior in online games, and you always need a mix of punishments and rewards. You can read more about our design philosophies here: http://oce.leagueoflegends.com/en/news/game-updates/player-behavior/exploring-player-behavior-design-values\n\nIf you're really interested in player behaviour give this [video](http://gdcvault.com/play/1017940/The-Science-Behind-Shaping-Player) a watch it is Jeffrey \"Lyte\" Lin talking about \"The Science Behind Shaping Player Behavior in Online Games\".","replies":[{"poster":"Free V Drinks","date":"2015-01-10T11:14:28.874+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":3,"body":"***","replies":[{"poster":"Wumachine","date":"2015-01-12T15:43:00.537+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"wow rude {{champion:84}} {{champion:103}} {{champion:11}} {{champion:5}} {{champion:157}}{{champion:238}} {{champion:98}} {{item:3070}} ","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Zximo","date":"2015-01-08T01:13:16.702+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thank you Maraudaur this is the first real evidence I have seen that RIOT is actively endeavoring to make LOL a better experience for everyone.\nThe video was quite interesting nice to see that RIOT \"Is\" committed to better game play for all.

I've had the misfortune lately to have one in every second game near enough. Though they all vary, trolls, griefers, feeders and down right abusive players.  I had a game an hour ago where I had someone go absolutely insane when I wouldn't dive the enemy ADC (I was the ADC as well) when we were both low health and there was a Thresh still living.  He subsequently got on someone else's bad side who started abusing him which resulted in him both feeding and reporting out positions to the enemy team.  \n\nA real Tribunal needs to be implemented soon.  People are getting fed up and normal mil mannered players are starting to turn into abusive team mates.","replies":[]},{"poster":"iNoob","date":"2015-01-07T18:18:12.746+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":6,"body":"Did u ever think that u may deserve to be verbally abused? if not reconsider, and if u are abused smile and say \"yes i am baddiey who needs to git gud\"","replies":[{"poster":"Brian Hail","date":"2015-01-08T15:00:07.370+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"No one deserves it.
