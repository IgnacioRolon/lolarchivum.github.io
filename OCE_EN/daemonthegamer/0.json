I didn't even receive a confirmation mail for my donation. Ended up mailing the support, they just resent the confirmation mail and told me I'd get the mail on how to redeem my icon once this campaign has ended. Others with the same problem we're told that they should contact the support in order to instantly get their icon, so I don't know what's true.\n\nJust sent another mail to the support now. Seems like they're not perfectly organized, but we're human after all.","replies":[{"poster":"LALingLing","date":"2016-11-13T14:55:51.735+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"ah, I just realized that post was from a month ago :D ops. did you receive your icon meanwhile?","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Monkey D Luffy","date":"2016-10-15T04:26:50.346+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I had this problem too, I just had to wait for the email I used on impact challenge, do you have any emails from omaze like a receipt? if you dont you could of made a typo, if you do then you just need to wait and it'll arrive soon :D","replies":[]}]}
