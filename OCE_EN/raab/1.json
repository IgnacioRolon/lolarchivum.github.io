This is unacceptable and has caused me to lose LP and rank series. Its becoming increasingly worrying. On top of this I have found that the mac client bugs out and goes white screen and constantly tries to update it self. \r\n\r\nI was just in a champ select for a ranks game and after I managed to get back into the screen (after it shut down) before it was my turn to select, the champs wouldn&#039;t come up for me to select. Completely blank. WTF RIOT. I&#039;ve put a decent amount of money and time into this, and this is what I get out of it. Constant shut downs and bugs.\r\n\r\nSPECS on the brief:\r\n\r\nmacOS Sierra - Version 10.12.4\r\n13-inch, Early 2017\r\n2.7 GHz Intel Core i5\r\n\r\nPlease can you explain yourself and provide some fixes.\r\n\r\n{{sticker:slayer-jinx-unamused}}","replies":[{"poster":"SephirothSG","date":"2017-05-10T04:56:33.542+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey there,\n\nSounds odd that your entire system is powering down, it's possible your computer may be overheating.\n\nI'm not too familiar with mac OS, however could you please download the \"[Intel Power Gadget](https://software.intel.com/en-us/articles/intel-power-gadget-20)\" software and monitor your system temperatures at idle and while running league, reply back with what you find.","replies":[]}]}
