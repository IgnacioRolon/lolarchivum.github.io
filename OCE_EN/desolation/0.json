It would be nice considering it could even make up for some peoples horrible map awareness and would be a nice addition to the appeal of in-game. Please consider this Rito&#039;s will much appreciate to see this in any upcoming update&#039;s :^D.","replies":[{"poster":"Neosinf","date":"2017-01-15T11:48:59.890+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Also have their portrait flash when they lose more then 10% health so you know they are fighting","replies":[{"poster":"Desolation","date":"2017-01-16T09:15:29.642+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"That would be really helpful too considering people don't notice nearby jungler's fighting so would also be quite a good addition.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"SEKAI","date":"2017-01-15T08:26:11.415+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I concur.\n\nAlso, give options to toggle on/off the notification such as posting \"player_name (champion_name) is recalling to base\" or something like that into chat would be great too.","replies":[{"poster":"Desolation","date":"2017-01-16T09:14:27.083+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yeah.","replies":[]}]}]}
