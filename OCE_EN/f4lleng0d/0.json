I have been proactively trying different support options trying to fix this such as; Reinstall, repair, delete certain RADS folders, disabled services, run as admin etc. But still unable to get to the login screen. \r\n\r\nPatcher version is 0.44.0.161\r\n\r\nOnly other thing to note is that the EULA agreement for September 23rd 2014 keeps popping up no matter how many times i accept it. Along with the EULA for 19th of April 2016.\r\n\r\nIf any members or staff have any possible solutions, i am more then willing to try. If any software info is needed let me know.","replies":[{"poster":"SephirothSG","date":"2016-05-18T08:06:53.036+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey there,\n\nCould you please download the [Hextech Repair Tool](https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/player-support/tools/Hextech%20Repair%20Tool.msi), launch it as Administrator and run with the default settings.\n\nA file should be saved to your Desktop called LoL-Logs.zip, please upload this file somewhere of your choice and reply with a link to the file so I can look into this issue further for you.","replies":[]}]}
