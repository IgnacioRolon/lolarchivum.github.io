There&rsquo;s a pretty big format change this year with a play-in stage instead of the gauntlet we had previously for the teams from the smaller regions. So why not start with who we think is going to make it out of the play-in stage.\r\n \r\nFor those that haven&rsquo;t been paying much attention the play in stage works like this. Teams from the smaller regions and the third place teams from the LPL, NA LCS, LMS and EU LCS were drawn into groups of three (You can watch that as well as the whole draw here: https://youtu.be/fw3qOWNksYY).\r\n \r\nThese teams will them play the other two teams in there groups in a best of one double round robin (I.E they will play each team twice). The team that places third will be eliminated while the teams that place 1st will be randomly drawn against one of the teams that came 2nd in another group. The winners of those best of 5&rsquo;s will them be placed into the remaining places in the group stages.\r\n \r\nHere are the groups.\r\n \r\nGroup A\r\n \r\nTeam WE (LPL)\r\nGambit CIS (LCL)\r\nLyon Gaming (LLN)\r\n \r\nGroup B\r\n \r\nCloud 9 (NA LCS)\r\nTeam oNe eSports (CBLOL)\r\nDire Wolves (OPL)\r\n \r\nGroup C\r\nFnatic (EULCS)\r\nYoung Generation (GPL)\r\nKaos Latin Gamers (CLS)\r\n \r\nGroup D\r\n \r\nHong Kong Attitude (LMS)\r\n1907 Fenerbahce Espor (TCL)\r\nRampage (LJL)\r\n \r\nSo who do think will make it out of the play-ins? Feel free to either just list the four teams you think will make it or note how you think the groups will end up. \r\n \r\nAs an Oceanian side note, how does everyone rate the Dire Wolves chances?\r\n \r\nIf people enjoy this I will put another one up between the play in and the group stages as well","replies":[{"poster":"Mozzie25","date":"2017-09-20T01:39:25.362+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"To try and reduce the wall of text I decided to post my opinions separately, rather than include then with the opener. The four I pick to make it are down the bottom of this both if you aren’t interested in the groups.\n \nGroup A\n \n1st: Team WE (LPL)\n2nd: Gambit CIS (LCL)\n3rd: Lyon Gaming (LLN)\n \nI honestly don’t think either Lyon or Gambit are gonna seriously challenge WE in this group. Despite the fact they were the third placed LPL team the made it to the semifinals of the last split and were relatively consistent all year, well as consistent as LPL teams can be. Admittedly I don’t know a ton about either Gambit or Lyon but I am gonna go with Gambit for 2nd based on the rough time Lyon had at MSI and the success of Albus Luna Nox last worlds (They beat M19, which is essentially Albus to make it to worlds). \n \nGroup B\n \n1st: Cloud 9 (NA LCS)\n2nd: Dire Wolves (OPL)\n3rd: Team oNe eSports (CBLOL)\n \nFrankly I’m not super sure on this group. It would be nice to see an OPL team make it in to the group stage but I don’t see Dire Wolves beating any of the top tier teams. While there last split was impressive and they walked all over the chiefs during the final, their performance at MSI was underwhelming to say the least. Hopefully they can give it a better shot this time. As for C9 I think they will hold onto 1st but drop a couple of games. The way they got spanked by Dignitas in the quarters was quite frankly embarrassing for a team that was supposed to be competing with Immortals and TSM. I wasn’t sold on their 3rd place win either, though full disclosure I’m a CLG fan so I might be a bit bitter about that. Team oNe eSports have had one hell of a run to get out of challenger and then make it worlds. But I think they will struggle now that there here against C9 and a more experienced Dire Wolves. \n \nGroup C\n1st: Fnatic (EULCS)\n2nd: Kaos Latin Gamers (CLS)\n3rd: Young Generation (GPL)\n \nHow do you go past Fnatic to win this group, I don’t think you can. They may be the 3rd EU team but there still dangerous and they will have far too much for either Young Generation or Kaos Latin Gamers. As for Young Generation vs Kaos, I am picking Kaos simply based on the way Young Generation made it to worlds. The Gigabyte Marines success at MSI is the reason the GPL has two teams at worlds and I am unsure if the Gigabyte Marines can continue their Fairy tale run at worlds (Though it would be nice, talk about exciting games), that does not bode well for the team that made it through the losers bracket.\n \nGroup D\n \n1st: 1907 Fenerbahce Espor (TCL)\n2nd: Rampage (LJL)\n3rd: Hong Kong Attitude (LMS)\n \nThis group should be an absolute riot. Attitude is probably the weakest of the teir one teams in the play-ins and both Fenerbahce and Rampage have been looking good. For first I have 1907 Fenerbahce they beat Super Massive to make it to worlds and went undefeated at Rift Rivals. I think it will be tooth and nail until the final game however. As for Rampage and Attitude I think it will end up in a coin flip I am not sold on a LMS third seed, the top two LMS teams never seem to live up to expectations or hype and rampage played well in both the regular season and Rift Rivals.\n \nAs for the four teams to make it out into group I think it will be \n \nWE\nCloud 9\nFnatic\n Dire Wolves\n \n….. Ok that last one may be a bit more fantasy than reality, but I like I said above it would be fucking fantastic to have an OPL team in the group stage. If they draw the winner of group D they might have a chance. As for the other three, I don’t see WE or Fnatic having too much trouble no matter who they draw. I think Cloud 9 will make it but if they draw Gambit or Rampage it could be a close series.","replies":[]}]}
