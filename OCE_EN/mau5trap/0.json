Ohh wait whats that a decent game ok, lets get in game,\n\n nope my entire team feeds and im the only one with kills and most damage not because I have any skill just a little awareness but because of seriously bad match making , ok well at least I got a decent champ select. next game, nope sht ppl, again, skip it, ohh wait 15 minutes now.\n\n wow riot wow thankyou 15 minutes , well know what stuff you its sunny outside no money for you today better things to do right after I tell you how I feel about your completely rubbish match making system and dodging rules. stop ruining the best game ever made, and please don&#039;t bother responding with your bandaid replies. \n\njust do the job we pay you so heavily for, $10 per skin, 10 skins buys a ps4 game that a company spent 3 plus years making, what a joke.","replies":[{"poster":"ROGU3","date":"2017-02-05T17:19:57.050+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"While I find the general tone of this post to be more 'in your face' than I would have worded it, I recently found myself supporting a platinum Ezreal. I am unranked. I did atrociously as Sona in a Varus Malz lane, and I got flamed the hardest I had ever been flamed before. Like, I'm a support main, I'm used to brushing off hatred all the time. Yet there I was dying to Varus Qs and voidlings, all the while trying my hardest to do everything I could for this Ezreal. \nHis abuse cut me so deep, because I knew he was right. He's platinum. I had no reason to be his support, why the hell was I put through that?\n\nAll I learnt was that platinum Ezreals can flame you while they farm.","replies":[{"poster":"mau5trap","date":"2017-02-08T17:33:02.598+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"rofl, that's some skill, flame while farming, dodging and poking I gather. yeah sorry mate don't mean to come across harsh to anyone but riot, I have been playing for 5+ years and its the same sht they still haven't fixed the bug where if you view more than 2 to 5 recently played profiles you get locked out of viewing any more and out of your own, like wtf fix ya game man. The list of fkd up things they ignore is so friggin big and all they do is band aid solutions or bring out a new champ. Look shiny!\n\non this account I have only 250 or less games yet I get matched with people with between 1500 and 5000, as in all five players on other team and my team has max 1000 games played errrr what exp doesn't make a difference. ohh its mmr bs that's right, idiots. They need to reconfig their mms to allow more variables but hell what would I know I haven't been playing games for 20 plus years or anything, we all report the same stuff but yep welcome to riot games.\n\nI highly recommend using the mute button upon the first instance and try shrug it off or I find just apologising asap in game and mute all to work well. btw, a good plat or above ez doesn't need a support anyway he is one of the best kite/poke champs there is.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Transcender","date":"2017-02-09T12:20:28.009+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Funny about the penalty thing.\n\nYou don't actually lose MMR which is what determines your LP gains/losses\n\nSo while it looks like you lose LP for dodging, you will gain it back over games in both wins and losses (losses by losing less than you would have).\n\nThe time penalty is not that strict either, 5 min > 30 min\n\nSo if you are willing to wait 5 to 30 mins to get back into queue when you are positive that you would lose that game, it is actually perfectly fine to dodge so you dont lose any mmr.","replies":[{"poster":"mau5trap","date":"2017-02-13T13:53:28.535+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yes I do see what you are saying, and thankyou I didn't think of it that way however, it does not make it right nor fair. things need to change, like match making needs to change. longer wait more accurate games thanks. If the wait time is longer it will also reduce the negativity, how? simply because games are not so easily entered into so therefore you will question if you really wanna waste that much more time. I did say reduce not get rid of.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Project Xayah","date":"2017-02-08T23:29:41.015+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":2,"body":"> WE HAVE THE RIGHT TO ABANDON CHAMP SELECT WITHOUT PENALTY!\n\nNo, you don't.\n\nYou don't even have the right to play, it's a privileged that Riot grants you to play their game. That privilege is given to you under the condition that you follow all rules set out by Riot, one of which is \"no dodging games\".\n\nNext time you want to complain about something, you should know what you are talking about first.","replies":[{"poster":"mau5trap","date":"2017-02-13T13:44:12.827+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Who butters who's bread? child.\nQuite simply, the customer has priority, the customer is the one who pays.\nThis is a business. If they keep this game as broken as it is then less customer, which is already evident in oceania, they have admitted this. You see such a small picture maybe because of your age. Don't get me wrong I love this game it was once fkn brilliant, over 5 years it has just gone down hill. I don't want it to fade away but it will if it keeps going the way it is, sorry but there are so many more that agree than the few of you that don't. maybe check out a few pro streams?","replies":[]}]}]}
