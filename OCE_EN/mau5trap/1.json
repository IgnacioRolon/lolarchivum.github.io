Yes this is what you do riot don&#039;t deny.\r\n\r\nso what else is there, well you can go through with the game waste 30 minutes as it most likely wont be 15 or 20 because the stubborn trolls wont ff and you know it, as you have no doubt experienced this many times before. This is the put up and shut up option where you decide to do nothing.\r\nNow society says (lol) that sitting on the fence (doing nothing about a wrong situation) is just as bad or equivalent as to join the negative side. hmm.\r\n\r\nso that leaves the best decision as to dodge the que and reset the opportunity to call lanes. As this DIFFUSES the situation (ohh snap)\r\nBut wait, so you que dodge and you , YOU get pinged with a 5 minute wait timer. ok can deal with that. its like getting a foul look from your boss for doing something he isn&#039;t happy with, no problem.\r\nthen up to 8, yes EIGHT hours later if the situation happens again. BAM 15 minutes. really. I mean REALLY riot.\r\nSo what is it you actually stand for then? so I have just over an hour to kill before I go to work of school or whatever perfectly safe amount of time to play a game, now I have 15min ban timer nope, too risky and not fair on others if I afk (because then I get stung AGAIN) after 30 min if the games not done then. so I miss out because I did the right thing by myself and others. errrr gj riot gj.\r\n\r\nBut you are never wrong are you? no, just deny deny deny that&#039;s how it works isn&#039;t it, like the match making? \r\nthe other day I felt sooo sorry for the other team, we all ended up having scores above 9/1 max was 15/1 or something similar, the other team got so very outplayed, they just weren&#039;t even close to the same level but according to riot they were, you are so fair, and never wrong.\r\nown your mistakes fix your game!\r\n\r\nthankyou.","replies":[{"poster":"Lord Sesshomaru","date":"2017-04-17T08:09:16.132+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"So what youre saying is _(and correct me if I'm wrong)_:\n\"You shouldnt be punished for dodging?\"\n\nIf that is what you are trying to say, then you probably haven't considered all the implications this has.\n\nIm a mid laner (arguably the most popular position). \nI do want to go mid most games. But often I lose the call and someone else gets mid and i have to support or ADC. That happens maybe 40% of the time?\n\nIf there was no punishment for dodging, whats to stop me dodging every time i don't get mid? In fact, whats to stop every single mid laner in existence from dodging every time they don't get mid?\n\nWhats to stop every single player in the world dodging every game until they get their position?\n\nImagine if you physically couldn't play a game unless every singe player _(thats 10 players)_ got exactly the position they wanted. How long do you think that would take? You could spend a week and still not find a single playable game.\n\nThats why there are dodge penalties. The system doesn't know why you are dodging, it doesn't know that 'Player 3' is a c**t and is stealing your position. All it knows is that you prevented 9 other players from having theirs, by dodging.\nSo it punishes you accordingly.\n\nRiot aren't stupid, they have teams of professionals working on all the different aspects of the game. You can be sure that they have spent a lot of time figuring out lots of different systems to help people get the lanes they want in a reasonable amount of time. \nAnd to date the system we have is probably the best one. If it wasn't, and there was one that was 100% better in every single way, I'm sure they would have used that one instead.","replies":[{"poster":"mau5trap","date":"2017-08-09T16:29:05.340+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Lord Sesshomaru,realm=OCE,application-id=T8eq2lFQ,discussion-id=K1xcdw6i,comment-id=0001,timestamp=2017-04-17T08:09:16.132+0000)\n>\n>\n> Riot aren&#x27;t stupid, they have teams of professionals working on all the different aspects of the game.

The fact that I can jump on , and 4 of 5 games has some immature kid being a nob, kinda pisses me and a lot of other people off. Thankyou for fitting into the stereotypical riot buttsniffing supporter. 22,000 people on a off day is their player average, and match making is at 1minute 20 second average because of close match made teams, errrr no, fast que equals less accurate match making. go do some math. Riot has turned into a franchise, franchise is about maximising profits not fair gameplay, not equal match making, not how to encourage the community to be less toxic, not to help those getting bullied, just to make more money. hence stupid emotes that EVERY single comment about it was asking riot not to put it in, guess what, the emotes that no one wants are not free, wow big surprise. sniff sniff. ;)","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Talon12","date":"2017-04-17T06:45:42.348+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Lets see if i got this right..\n\nWhaa whaa, blah blah blah... 8 hours, blah blah whaa... fix your game.\n\nDid i get it?","replies":[{"poster":"RAV3N","date":"2017-04-17T06:49:29.504+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"That's a bit unfair.\n\nYou get people who insist on being childish, spamming 100 times their roles and noone gets a chance to sort out their roles till theres < 10 seconds on the clock.\n\nOnly way to deal with not ending up in an obviously unbalanced team is to dodge.\n\nUnfair but that's how it is for real.\n\nNot a whinge, just people spoiling it for others.","replies":[{"poster":"Talon12","date":"2017-04-17T09:02:20.157+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Well it is a whinge, you aren't taking into account the repercussions of not having a timer on dodges are you.","replies":[{"poster":"Lord Sesshomaru","date":"2017-04-17T09:45:32.860+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I have to agree with Talon12 on this, I don't think OP has thought about the consequences.\n\nShit happens in champ select, thats how it is, and how it always will be if there is free-will in the world.\n\nif someone takes your lane, its up to you to fill in the blanks for the team.
