From this, we can establish that the revive order is:\r\n1) Make them targetable\r\n2) Restore the Champion to full hp / Set them to alive\r\n3) &quot;Teleport&quot; them to their starting position\r\nParts 1 and 2 perhaps being one step combined.\r\n\r\nBecause of this, it is possible to Mark them as they come back to life, meaning you&#039;re going to have a bad time by jumping to them.\r\n\r\nEven though the odds of this happening are astronomical, it may be necessary to rework it to \r\n1) Teleport the body to the start position\r\n2) Restore their HP\r\n3) Make them targetable\r\n\r\n\r\nNot that it&#039;s necessary, but match history = [(http://matchhistory.oce.leagueoflegends.com/en/#match-details/OC1/88455632/200033242)]","replies":[{"poster":"HORSE OF FORCE","date":"2015-05-07T10:59:20.153+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Reposts won't make it more noticed.","replies":[{"poster":"Yugatha","date":"2015-06-23T15:48:07.871+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yeah, I know.
