I keep getting the message (unable to reconnect.... please check internet connection.. ) after champion select despite having an internet connection. I went through the troubleshooting however (restarting my computer and everything) it did not help until the day after for some reason. I got a leavebuster 20 minute low priority wait time for 5 games, of which I believe I really don&#039;t deserve since I tried to reconnect to my game to the best of my ability. \r\n\r\nIf there is anyway I could be exempted from this, please, I would gladly appreciate it. \r\nThanks,\r\n\r\nXpertNugget","replies":[{"poster":"Wuks","date":"2015-11-24T17:35:52.236+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey XpertNugget,\n\nI'm sorry to hear that you're encountering connection issues to the League of Legends servers.
