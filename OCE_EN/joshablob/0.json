I found this post a few hours ago but forgot to reply. You seem like just the type of player I need. I am silver 4 right now, but I seem to be able to hold my own against gold players and platinum players. Anyway, I'd be glad to be your duo partner if you'd like! Hope you choose me, see you later and good luck summoner!\n\n- Kaladin","replies":[{"poster":"Challenger 4 Mee","date":"2017-02-14T09:51:18.017+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"can i duo with u ? i'm now silver 4","replies":[]}]}]}
