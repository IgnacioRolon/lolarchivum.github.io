I&#039;ve been playing LoL for a good season now and have found I really enjoy Draven and got him to 200k but I&#039;m now quite burnt out of him. I&#039;ve gotten a good taste for what each champion does but still having troubles finding my next main. \r\n\r\nI find myself mostly enjoying aggressive champions and love turning ganks around and making everyone think how... Thus I became a Draven OTP. I also enjoy the champions who inflict a lot of damage but still a quite tanky, a bruiser pretty much. I love the &#039;outplays&#039; champions. I love snowball champions who once have a couple of kills they just destroy the opponents and you become unstoppable. \r\n\r\nI really enjoy playing roles where raw skill can really show and when necessary you have to test yourself at times. I think the feeling of beating someone 1 on 1 is what keeps me motivated to keep on playing that role and or champion. I&#039;ve never liked the idea of peeling or the idea of support, but love being the one who again just destroys the enemy. \r\n\r\nI of course still want to have fun but not get bored of the champion quickly and hopefully main them for as long as I did on Draven. The biggest challenge I face is always changing my mind on who I want to play after maining Draven for a long time. One day I want to play Riven the next match I want to play Elise as an example. \r\n\r\nI would really appreciate advice that is new and not just champions that I enjoy as I would like to learn some new things for when I am trying to for my main once more. \r\n\r\nOverall I love aggressive champions who make those plays where you leave the enemy clueless on how they lost, but also take raw skill in laning face. \r\n\r\nThank you so much for you help!{{champion:119}}","replies":[{"poster":"SnowyBlizz","date":"2017-06-06T08:20:45.326+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Since you enjoy playing ADC. i can suggest Xayah{{champion:498}}  and Twitch{{champion:29}} . Both are also ADC's and can turn a fight easy. Twitch is a snowball heavy champion that can use his stealth for great roams and avoid ganks. Not to mention how strong he is late game. Xayah is really fun, great kiting and when an enemy dives onto you, your ULT can stop their advance. Not to mention as you move backwards, you leave a path of feathers that can snare the pursuer or half the enemy team if they are unlucky.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Raijin Bokun","date":"2017-06-04T11:27:12.323+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Illaoi \n\nShe looks like she ticks all your boxes, and despite what some people say it's a learning curve to play her properly","replies":[]},{"poster":"Blamzite","date":"2017-06-03T14:30:48.101+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Rek'sai who happens to be my main is excellent jungler with a huge skill gap.\nAfter her rework i really reccomend giving her a shot you can build tanky,bruiser or just raw dmg. Often with 1 or 2 kills u can then 1v1 anyone asling as there not fed asf\n\nCan also be used top and mid but not quite as effective","replies":[]}]}
