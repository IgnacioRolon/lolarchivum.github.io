He began placement matches and finished with 3 win and 7 loses where he placed in Bronze II. This shocked me at first as I thought he would place a lot lower than I&#039;d expected. Than I began thinking, is there a certain formula or certain amount of wins which are guaranteed for you to place in a certain division. My question being; IS there a formula to determine your rank and how does that formula work?\r\n\r\nMany Thanks, \r\nGetJinxedddd  \r\n{{sticker:slayer-pantheon-thumbs}}","replies":[{"poster":"DarkShade918","date":"2017-09-24T04:17:54.725+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"My duo first time ranked went 0W/10L ended up silver 5","replies":[]},{"poster":"KnevDog","date":"2017-09-24T04:15:33.736+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"so i just done my placements probaly only played 40 pvp games since i mainly played bots, anyway i lost probaly like 6 straight then 1 win then 2 loss then 1 more win, so i went 2/10 first matches were around silver 1 - gold 5, then went to mid silver then finished and placed at silver 5,  maybe it seeds from your pvp elo as well? a couple of the games i duo'd with silver and bronze, in 3 games","replies":[]},{"poster":"CHEESYLEEKS","date":"2017-09-22T12:06:33.292+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"standard placement mmr for new players is usually silver 4-5.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Project Xayah","date":"2017-09-22T12:00:32.045+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Based on my personal experience last season, it would seem that a single win/loss has an effect equivalent to an MMR change of approximately 2 divisions, while consecutive wins/losses will have a reduced effect on MMR. So winning 2 matches in a row might increase your MMR by about 3 divisions, while losing twice, winning one, then losing once would lower MMR by about 2-3 divisions (down by ~3 divisions, up by ~2, down by ~2-3).\n\nI can't speak for how accurate that method is, whether it's still relevant, or what the effects other factors (like, for example, mastery grades) would be.","replies":[]}]}
