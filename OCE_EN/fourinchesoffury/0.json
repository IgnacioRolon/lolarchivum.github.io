I figured out the problem and it was a proxy that steam, Uplay and league couldn&#039;t run through. i had to disable the proxy and it started working again. \r\nhope this works:\r\n1) Go to Start and type proxy \r\n2)Click on the program that pops up on the top of the startmenu. (should be something like &quot;Proxy network settings&quot;)\r\n3) Go to LAN-Settings / Proxy settings\r\n4) unclick the top box in the Proxyserver section.

If you're the person that did this, then attempting to connect without use of the proxy should be something you try naturally when something doesn't work (100% reliance on your own server is just asking for trouble). If you *aren't* the person who did it, then you're under-mining the person who did it for you, which could have even worse unforeseen consequences (extreme example, but if your normal connection is being monitored, then connecting without a proxy puts you at risk). You're better off just asking the person who did it for you to try it without the proxy.","replies":[]}]}
