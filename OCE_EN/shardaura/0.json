If so, the patch may have downloaded incorrectly. Could you try another repair for me and let me know if that helps?\n\nIf there was not a patch in between the first repair and now, I'm going to need you to download the [hextech toolkit](https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/player-support/tools/HTK_Setup.msi), install it, select your region and run with the default settings. A file should be saved to your desktop called **LoL-Logs.zip**, please upload this file somewhere (mega.co.nz would be my choice) and link it here.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"ShardAura","date":"2016-04-20T22:07:41.112+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Looks to be good, havent had a maestro failure, crash as of yet.","replies":[]},{"poster":"ShardAura","date":"2016-04-20T20:58:22.730+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Just repaired the client.
