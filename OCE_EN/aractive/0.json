It's seen that you've been regularly leaving games in the past, and a penalty is applied to your account to disuade you from doing it again. Then, right as your punishment is lifted, you stop sending commands to your character for twenty minutes, indicating that you left the game once again.\n\nNow, this seems harsh and unjust, and that's because it is. Honestly it shouldn't have been completely automated. But even then, if a person were to review your case, it would be the same. You disconnecting from the game due to a \"trying to reconnect\" is the exact same as you pulling the plug on your computer. It's just unfortunate that you were already marked for leaving games in the past.\n\nThe best course of action to take from here is to identify exactly why you were disconnected from the game and attempt to remedy that, if possible.","replies":[]}]}
