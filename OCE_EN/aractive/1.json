But for some annoying and stupid reason the past week of me playing this game has resulted in me getting 1000+ ping and no being able to move. For example I was in a ranked  match as Kha'Zix, I started with 700 ping, so i decided to disconnect and reconnect, then I was at spawn with 1000+ ping couldnt move couldnt type. So i decided to completely close the client and re-log, which I did, then had the same problem, after about 6 attempts of trying to be able to move and i just gave up..... NOW I HAVE A 5 GAME 20 MINUTE WAIT BAN BECAUSE OF YOUR SHITTY SERVER. I have put so much time and money into the game, where i cant even play because your server is horrid. (Btw this problem has been happening day  in day out and im getting banned for it.)","replies":[{"poster":"BladeSensual","date":"2015-02-10T05:55:33.437+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"getting the exact same issue. it is starting to get ridiculous","replies":[]},{"poster":"ToxicHawk","date":"2015-02-09T04:20:31.133+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hmm I haven't seen any major issues with Telstra/Bigpond, but that being said there might be.\n\nCould you head over to the link I added to my previous post and email the results to ocelivereports@riotgames.com.","replies":[]},{"poster":"ToxicHawk","date":"2015-02-09T03:08:12.385+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey Aractive,\n\nI am sorry to hear you are experiencing this problem.\n\nCan you let me know:\n\n- How often does this happen?\n- What ISP are you with?\n- What type of connection do you have (ADSL, Wireless, Fiber, etc)?\n- What city are you in?\n\nWe are aware that some users on Flip NZ are experiencing some issues when connecting to league of legends and we are trying to work with them to resolve the matter. But as always the more data we have to analyze and discuss with the ISP's the better we can work to resolve this issue.\n\nOf course if you are not using Flip (or one of the ISP's that uses their services) then we will look further into what could possibly be causing this for you.\n\nI would also suggest heading over to [oce.leagueoflegends.com/tools/network-logs](http://oce.leagueoflegends.com/tools/network-logs) and using the Network Diagnostic Tool to complete a few tests to our services. You can then send an email to ocelivereports@riotgames.com (with your details form above and a description of your issue) including the results file that is generated and either myself or one of the OCE Live Team can look further into the issue for you.\n\n\n-ToxicHawk","replies":[{"poster":"Aractive","date":"2015-02-09T04:16:35.133+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Okay Ive never had a problem before like this, i just did a normal game aswell and the same thing happened half way through,\n\nHappens almost every game\nI'm with Telstra/Bigpond\nI have cable\nI'm in Brisbane\n\nThe thing that pisses me off the most is that i get a 5 game ban and have to wait 20 minutes","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Sammuluv","date":"2015-02-09T02:56:52.699+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"yeah this happened for me as well, happens a lot, and apparently it's related to the problem that causes the crashes at load screen, I'm still trying to find  fix for it.\n\nLast i tried was upgrading my system to win7 ultimate x64, and it worked perfectly, until a few days ago. \n\nSo yeah, I'll keep looking for a fix and when i find one, I'll post on forum\n\n-Sammuluv (proud to be bronze)","replies":[]}]}
