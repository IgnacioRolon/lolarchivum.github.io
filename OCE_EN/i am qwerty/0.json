Onto topic, I&#039;m kinda in that part of the game where you&#039;re trying to find something new to do. I coach ppl for solo que as a part time job but this is completely free! If you think you need to improve on the game, stuck in elo hell etc.... I can sure as hell get u out. And no I will not elo boost anyone. Any girl gamers wanting to come hang and chat are also welcome =). Hopefully you&#039;ll all be comfortable with using skype.
