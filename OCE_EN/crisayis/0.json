I know everyone's had a problem with this bug at some time or another, I had it once a year back for a few days. I've tried all the fixes etc. I've tried both my accounts, my friend on the same connection is having the same issue. Trying on other region accounts results the same. Is anyone els having this problem? Such a pain because from my experiences you just have to kind of wait for it to leave. Seems to be something to do with the patch though, I was playing fine yesterday.","replies":[{"poster":"PickleSickle","date":"2015-01-16T05:13:01.303+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Same problem.

Sometimes a big patch will change League's internal name, and it's simply that your firewall didn't update with it as well, hence it's not allowing the new League to communicate.\n\nBest of luck.","replies":[]},{"poster":"WhenIsAnnie16","date":"2015-01-15T22:05:48.042+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Same thing here.
