Understand that they are limited by the hardware of the cinemas in question, those that can receive a direct satellite feed to show the games live. \n\nIt seems that this year they have partnered with EVENT rather than HOYTS for whatever reason (possibly to vary the locations?), so they are limited by what compatible locations EVENT has. \n\nAs far as I know, even HOYTS didn't have any direct feed compatible cinemas in the ACT so it seems like you might be in a bit of a dead zone for that I'm afraid.\n\nBut! If you have friends that play I can wholeheartedly recommend making a viewing party of your own! Even if it's just a couple people, they can be great fun :)","replies":[]},{"poster":"SamoanHunter","date":"2018-10-19T13:28:07.774+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Usually Hoyts are in partnership with Riot whenever the Worlds are on.\n\nOr just local OPL events occur.\n\nNot too sure, I'll see what I find doe.\n\nEDIT: Yeah I can't find shit lol. Only 'League of Origin' and OPL finals. They did do this before 2 years ago though. Unfortunate my bro.","replies":[]}]}
