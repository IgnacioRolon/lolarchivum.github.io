Unless you have actual depression, like the diagnosable kind not the #WhitePeopleProblems kind, I have never understood people's fascination with verbal bullying.\n\nLike, maybe my views on this are skewed because I spent a lot of my childhood at my dad's engineering workplace where cursing is basically an adjective, but I've always understood that words are absolutely meaningless until you add context and, more importantly, your own feelings to it. Hell, I was a WEIRD kid, like insulted by random strangers across the street levels of weird. I spent my childhood being called everything you can think of, not just by others but by my family, and I've never once said to myself \"Oh wow, that person called me a stupid head, better get the bleach.\"\n\nEspecially with \"Cyberbullying\", they're words on a screen by some random 11 year old that doesn't know when to shut their mouth, I just don't understand how people can take that seriously. You have mute buttons, you have block and ignore buttons, you have all these tools that literally erase the problem from your reality. The only way I can understand this becoming a problem is if they're spamming all your social networks, making new accounts to get past your blocks, and keeping up a barrage of nonsense. And that's called harassment people, we don't need another word for it just report it to the police and boom, it's dealt with.\n\nBullying used to be about actual physical abuse. Like some guy or girl will show up with a couple of their mates and kick your head in until you give them what they want. I'm sorry, but this is just a non issue to me.\n\nAnd if you DO have depression, and this kind of thing affects you that much, I'm sorry but you shouldn't even be on the Internet because there is SO much worse waiting for you out there than ANYTHING I've seen in the League community. You need therapy to help you come to terms with it, medication to help you deal with it, not a bunch of people holding your hand and telling you it'll stop if we ban enough people because news flash it will never go away, EVER. You could ban thousands of people a day from the Internet and tens of thousands more will replace them, because it's the Internet and it's anonymous and 11 year old idiots have nothing better to do with their day.","replies":[{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2016-04-11T02:22:01.046+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I don't entirely disagree, I just hope that maybe I can give you a bit of insight. I want to respond to this paragraph specifically:\n\n> And if you DO have depression, and this kind of thing affects you that much, I'm sorry but you shouldn't even be on the Internet because there is SO much worse waiting for you out there ...\n\nAs someone who DOES suffer from chronic depression, and as an introvert, if only it were that easy. I do avoid the internet people in general. I stick to things like youtube videos and _playing League with friends_. It's worth noting that I never play solo anymore, I just don't enjoy it, but when I'm feeling like utter shit, League is my _escape_. \n\nLeague is my constant, my routine, the thing that I can trust to be consistent and always there. And in fact in normals I rarely encounter negativity. Now when it's really bad I don't do anything at all, but if I just need a little pick me up then League with friends is my go to.\n\nSometimes, that one asshat who decides to say something like \"How much did your friend pay to get boosted to Diamond\" when I know damn well he got there through his own damn hard work and effort can be enough to really upset you.\n\nIn my experience it's honestly rarely the \"kys\" or the \"n00b jungler\" that really get to you, because they are fairly meaningless and impotent. It's more often the consistency, the ones who all game are telling you how shit you are and \"omg this f'king jungler never ganked\" even though you ganked them plenty, or \"f'king support taking my CS\" when it was one and it was an accident. It's the comments that are designed to frustrate, the comments that have no factual basis and are constant _and the in game behaviour that goes with it_ that really gets to you.\n\nI know to take a step back, to remember it's just a game and that it doesn't matter, but not everyone is so lucky to have the presence of mind to do that.\n\nDo I agree that some people need to harden up? Sure. Do I think that we should be callous to those who are affected by negativity and call them little bitches for getting upset? Definitely not. Just because someone CAN take abuse, doesn't mean they SHOULD, and it doesn't by any means make it right.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Lord Sesshomaru","date":"2016-04-10T12:17:22.276+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"This is correct.

Huge groups of people in India, Africa, China etc live in slums or worse, people have seen their children executed by isis before their eyes and on live streams, people have had their homes destroyed by cyclones in the islands and their whole family now lives under a tarpaulin and a few sheets of corrugated iron. \n\nSo when someone on a computer game (to even have the time and money to engage in such a trivial activity shows how much better off you are than the majority of people in the world) is slightly offensive to you, its literally NOTHING in comparison. So the people who take this trash talking so seriously need to get their act into gear and place themselves in the bigger picture. Don't be one of those people who gets 'deeply' offended because they were accidentally called 'bisexual' instead of 'pansexual' and go on a rant as if their life was in danger. Seriously, people get blown up on a daily basis overseas, the world has far bigger problems than whatever attention-seeking sexuality you want to be, or what so-and-so called you on a fictional computer game when you won and he didn't, or that you tripped on a stair and now want to sue the person who owned the staircase.

But in all seriousness, if someone did kill themselves over something so trivial, then at that point, I'm pretty sure it was going to happen anyway regardless of what the last straw happened to be.\n\nObviously my post here isn't particularly PC, but its the hard truth.

I don't know where people get off thinking it's okay to say that to someone else without actually understanding what it could mean. \n\nInternet bullying is a real thing and real people have taken their own lives over it.

It's not just a matter of 'hardening up' or 'drinking some concrete' but being able to be in a society where people have a level of decency to not threaten someone's life. \n\nI know we can't control what people say of course but Riot can definitely control whether people can play their game or not.","replies":[{"poster":"Lord Sesshomaru","date":"2016-04-08T22:08:22.549+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"A society where people have a level of decency to not threaten someones life, has never existed in all of human history, and likely will never exist in the future. \n\nThe only difference being that in the past people didn't kill themselves because someone else was a bit mean, and the reason for that is because they had more important things to deal with, like collecting enough food so they wouldn't starve, protecting against Viking raids, battling plague. Hell 50% of children didn't even make it to 10 years old, so they didn't have the time to get all moody and 'fuck-the-world' because their neighbour said something bad, they couldn't afford to worry about something so trivial (and it was even a time where death threats had much more chance of being carried out as well).\n\nBut because we don't have Vikings or the black plague or have to go out and hunt for food, our society has become weak, we take things like PCness and health and safety wayyyyy too far.

Ideally they shouldn't say anything bad, but the world isn't ideal (even runeterra the fictional world we escape to, isn't ideal) and at some point people just need to accept that. \n\nIf you are so at risk of killing yourself over what someone says on an online game i'd be seriously questioning why you'd put yourself in a situation that is known for toxicity such as lol in the first place, there are hundreds of single player games just as if not more fun than lol that don't involve other people, sure its not fair that you cant play lol because of that, but seriously if you're at risk of killing yourself, you don't put yourself in situations that make it worse. Thats like going base jumping if you have a heart condition, its not not a good idea no matter how much you want to do it or how unfair it is that you cant.\n\nYes people who say things with a direct intention to be cruel should receive some disciplinary action, but the truth is, you cant catch them all no matter what you do (short of removing chat altogether) \n\nIts like murders and drug dealers, yes they are bad people, and we need to do everything we can to punish/prevent them, but in reality, we cant get them all. So if you have a drug problem (in this case Depression), you don't rely on the police (Riot) to stop you taking drugs by catching the dealers, you remove yourself from the situation (play a different game), you don't walk home though the back alleys where the dealers hang out (toxic people on lol). You go to via a main street or park or the beach (Skyrim, Assassins creed, etc etc). thats just common sense. Don't put yourself in situations that could worsen your situation. Yes its not fair that if you're suicidal you cant play lol, but if you're at that stage i think that going without lol for a little while is the least of your problems.\n\n(FYI im not saying people with depression shouldn't play lol, I'm saying they need to judge what is best for them and their situation. Im sure psychiatrists would advise suicidal people not to play lol if they knew the stresses and stuff in the game.) \n\nand as for saying that to someone that has depression, yes i'll say it, they aren't crazy people or babies, they still have some rational thought. \n\nDepression sucks (i know) but you can either give into it and spiral down until you stop functioning altogether, or you can take action against it. People who have depression should never just be thrown out into the cold to fend for themselves, nor should you say \"get over it and harden up\" because it doesn't work like that. However, some things are appropriate to say 'harden up' to, and killing yourself over a comment some pre-pubesent brat that you'll never see again made online, is one of those things.","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"kaboomblah","date":"2016-04-08T12:33:14.215+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"This.

Hell, some are already recovering from suicidal thoughts, or even still have them. It is NOT their fault. So maybe be considerate of other human beings going through tough times, and less into victim shaming.

When people get so depressed that they're actually thinking of killing themselves they're not always going to call a hotline.\n\n It only takes great support from the community, family and friends to beat something like that. It's not something that you can just tell yourself to get over or simply start thinking a different way. It's something that affects you on a hormonal and chemical level in the brain. \n\nI've never suffered from depression myself but I can at least understand that it's not just something to shrug off.

So unless you're a complete imbecile, you'll sooner or later realise that living in an abusive environment is not a normal way of life, after that its just willpower, if people truly have the will to change, then they will. \n\nThe bottom line is that people shouldn't reach this level of toxicity in this community, But its also that we shouldn't make war with other people, and Europe (and most of the rest of the world) has torn itself apart twice in recent history doing just that. \n\nTheres a difference between what should be done and what can be done, and you just cant vett out every single person that has a contrary opinion to you. Sure you can make a bot that bans anyone instantly as soon as it hears the words 'kill yourself' but then you just banned someone for saying \"dude don't jump into Jax and Lee you'll kill yourself\" as well. \n\nSure the threat of harshly punishing everyone who mentions anything about killing yourself, will indeed stop some people from saying it, but being banned from lol is nothing compared with the death sentence or life inprisonment which is the punishment for murder, yet people still murder other people. \n\nSo if the concept of death or rotting in a prison doesn't deter some people from doing what they want, how do you think a chat ban will?\n\nNo i don't think its alright to say that, (even though we have the right of 'freedom of speech' so technically they should be allowed to say whatever they want without any repercussions) but i also think that someone saying that is such a minor issue compared with other problems in the world that require our more immediate attention. \n\nIts like stubbing your toe, yes it hurts but when your friend has a broken spine and moving is agony, you suddenly put it in perspective, and you think to yourself \"should i really yell and scream and make a fuss that i stubbed my toe, when my friend right next to me will be paralysed for the rest of his life? hmmm maybe i shouldn't.\"\n\nThats why young children cry when they get hurt, its because they haven't yet been able to put hat small pain in perspective, so to them its the worst thing in the world. But as they grow up they learn to realise that falling over in the playground is not the end of the world and there are far worse things that can happen, and so they stop crying when it happens.","replies":[{"poster":"Malcolm Trumble","date":"2016-04-11T09:17:27.221+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Physical pain is **COMPLETELY** different to depression. \n\nNo matter how small an insult is, you sit and think on it. You make something so insignificant into a huge deal, and you have little to no power to stop it; it's generally very subconscious. Suddenly, killing yourself doesn't seem like such a bad idea after all. How could it be bad if it ends your pain, right? You are blinded by it, and there is no light anymore. \n\nAnd yes, there are other problems in the world. They're not Riot's problem, that's not something Riot are paid to deal with. Controlling their community, on the other hand, is definitely something they **can** and **should** deal with. \n\nAgain, **victim shaming is not the way to end this. \n**\nNot to mention, Riot will only pick up the phrase \"kill yourself\" if the person is reported, and I'm sure there'll be parameters within which the phrase is either acceptable or reviewed by a staff member. People will only be punished for doing the wrong thing. \n\nSo please, read up on depression and understand that it isn't a matter of hardening up, nor is it a matter of perspective.
