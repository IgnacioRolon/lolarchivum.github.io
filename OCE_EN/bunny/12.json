As far as I understand is that matchmaking might not always put you with a team that is your own MMR/Rank so that those unpopular roles may be filled if people are having long queue times. As a support main my games have been in flux constantly. \n\nGoing between games with Gold 3-Plat 5 to Bronze 1-Silver 4. I am personally Gold 3 and worked hard to get to this rank and as a support main I rely heavily on my team. There is a small window for carry potential as a support but other roles will always outshine. How can you even be matched with or against a Bronze or lower when in my case I can&#039;t even queue with someone in those ranks. It&#039;s actually disgusting.\n\nhttp://imgur.com/a/jUpFy\n\nThis game is what is wrong with the matchmaking system. As you can see I am ranked with people severely below my rank because these other people had long queue times. While we received a level 30 the system sought to &#039;balance&#039; the match by putting me in there but I only queue&#039;d as a support and can&#039;t carry. \n\nThis post is merely to show the flaws in the matchmaking system especially for supports and if we have to endure such stompings because the game is unbalanced then we should lose less LP.  Most of my other games have been with others of similar MMR and rank and I worked hard to achieve those wins. Because of poor balancing and long queue times I am made to suffer because I main support. Again we should lose less LP especially if I am playing with and against level 30s-Bronze while I sit in Gold 3. Sure if I had attained a role I could carry from (anything other then support) I could take the loss because essentially it is my job to carry. Support is exactly that and support mains shouldn&#039;t be forced into playing champions or roles we don&#039;t like. Personally I like playing supports like Janna, Soraka and Sona. I feel like I can have a bigger impact as a support playing these champions but alas you need balanced teams. I don&#039;t want to be forced into playing AP carry champions as support because it really isn&#039;t as fun.\n\nhttp://imgur.com/a/X3Dnv\n\nThis is the matchmaking I am satisfied with even if I lose.\n\n**I climb so that I can be matched against and with better players. What the hell is the point in climbing if I am still being matched with Bronze and Silver? It's a seriously horrible and flawed system. **","replies":[{"poster":"Sneed","date":"2016-08-01T22:04:53.695+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"support main\nmade to suffer\ncancerous champion pool\nbabyrage\n\nnot to mention you're playing sona all wrong. where is the lichbane rush and the sightstone skip in favour of trinket, then sell boots 50 minutes into the game for a sightstone and then get caught warding\n\ni love support players","replies":[{"poster":"Bunny","date":"2016-08-02T00:16:15.658+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"What","replies":[{"poster":"Sneed","date":"2016-08-02T01:19:30.391+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Bunny,realm=OCE,application-id=Ntey9fRZ,discussion-id=TgxeX02E,comment-id=00010000,timestamp=2016-08-02T00:16:15.658+0000)\n>\n> What\n\nyour mmr is trash and so is your champion pool","replies":[{"poster":"Bunny","date":"2016-08-02T02:02:28.985+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Considering you don't know how much LP I win and lose I doubt you can speculate whether my MMR is trash.

Yes people get boosted or people smurf but eventually with good play or bad play the end up where they are supposed to be. All my post is trying to indicate is that even if people are boosted or smurfing in my bracket it doesn't matter because I'm not even playing with my bracket. Honestly if I grind through gold which some speculate it can take months to get through gold or silver-gold then I want to be playing with people in gold. Surely that isn't to much to ask to play with people in your own damn bracket instead of people 2 tiers down. Sure that person in Bronze might be just as good or they might not be so I'd rather not roll a dice 50/50 with that and just get people in my own MMR in gold.","replies":[{"poster":"fattyhotdogs","date":"2016-08-03T01:58:22.213+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yep. You have the same perception. Just pretend that there is no bracket. Colors don't exist. Behind each champion in your game is a nerd at a computer. And the 'bracket' is usually going to tell you how skilled that nerd is at playing league in general. And it Most CERTAINLY is not going to tell you how well they will play any specific champion in specific matchups with specific teammates. \nThe only thing that a bracket is going to tell you is that they won enough games to get there","replies":[{"poster":"Bunny","date":"2016-08-03T03:19:04.927+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Essentially what you're saying is that you could go up against a diamond, master or challenger player and beat them because ranks don't matter? Honestly if you can do that post a video I'd like to see that. Until then I'd say yes bronze, silver and gold ranks aren't really that far apart skill wise but it is the small things that set them apart. Arguably gold players are going to have more map awareness, better kiting skills etc then a bronze player. I'd prefer to practice those skills against others that have map awareness and kiting skills so I can get better.","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Nijel","date":"2016-08-02T07:56:08.514+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I can confirm that as a D4 Support main I've been matched with anything between plat 5 and master over the last two days.

However, I guess it's highly based on MMR, and when I was bronze, I used to be able to beat a lot of high ranked people anyway (granted, it was normals). It's pre crappy rn, and I agree, because support's the most sought out role because no one plays it aha, but I guess riot's doing the best they can!
