Now this isn&#039;t salty or whinging but I&#039;d like to be constructive here. If you play Lee Sin please understand that your champion is limited. Your early game rocks and you can snowball lanes heavily. You don&#039;t do that when you take all the kills. What ends up happening is that you take all the kills go 7-0-0 early then come mid game you&#039;re 7-6-2. \r\n\r\nIf you snowball early build semi tank so you can at least survive enough to feed more kills to your comrades. Please don&#039;t think you are invincible with your lead and proceed to feed. This isn&#039;t all Lee Sins but evidence shows that 3/5 losses is because of a Lee Sin and that&#039;s some serious statistics there. \r\n\r\nP.S. This is semi sarcastic but also semi serious. Take it with some sugar coated salt. \r\n\r\n{{sticker:slayer-jinx-catface}}","replies":[{"poster":"kaboomblah","date":"2016-07-08T06:56:59.161+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I know exactly what you mean because I am one of these said anchors.\nI've played Lee Sin a lot, but man, I play so horribly with him, but I keep trying because he's so fun.\n\nSorry to anyone I've ever burdened with my trash Lee Sin.","replies":[]}]}
