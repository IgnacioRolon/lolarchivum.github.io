If you can only play one role you should be back in normals learning a secondary lane. Dynamic queue makes this whole process easier and there is literally no excuse to get a role and not know how to play it. I see so many hate posts on Riot because of the new dynamic queue problems but honestly the only problem here is the community. \n\nI have a lot of fun in this game and a lot of enjoyment but there is also a lot of frustration and anger. I know this post will go over so many peoples heads and there will most likely be a lot of salt. But if this can encourage one person to take ranked more seriously I would be happy. Some people have invested a lot of hours into this game trying to climb through the ranks and it&#039;s so disheartening to see someone just troll the hell out of the experience. \n\nAll I can say is find the type of champions that you do well with and play those in ranked. Personally my style is AP control mage and 90% of the time I can do well with those types of champions. Of course everyone should be able to play a tank in a role or two because there will always be a need for that. There will always be toxicity and trolls  but as a community we can make gaming a better experience if we ALL be considerate of other people. If you&#039;re tilted go have a break and if you want to try a new champion go to normals. \n\nRant over.","replies":[{"poster":"JasonWazza","date":"2016-06-03T11:02:33.410+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":">If you can only play one role you should be back in normals learning a secondary lane.
