Not to mention the occasional passive aggressive ping war between players and those who ping &quot;enemies are missing&quot; on top of your dead corpse. We can mute individual player chats so why not pings? If the player is toxic he&#039;s probably doing both. The new ping updates are awesome but can we please finally have the option to mute them without having to turn the volume down for all of them!\n\nVOTE BELOW\n\nP.S.
