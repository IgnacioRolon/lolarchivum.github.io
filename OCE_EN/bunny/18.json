If League is such a toxic community, then why isn't it their first priority? I think part of it is not being able to communicate properly when there is someone walking up the river and you can tell top lane instead of sacrificing a few CS to type it. Even then they might not even see if they're tunnel visioning CS themselves or a trade top. \n\nIs Riot looking at what is the cause of making people toxic and finding ways to improve the community on their end? From experience people generally only become toxic when they've had a few games in a row where someone has either AFK'd, fed or they've just had a loss. Getting into a fresh game where someone again goes 0-9-0 usually triggers that \"omg what the hell are you doing\". Then from that the person who is feeding already feels bad and tilts himself. This type of tilting is avoidable if people have a clear head and take breaks and they'll play better ovall and maybe be able to carry. \n\nSo instead of looking at the LCU for months on end so it's easier for us to buy things from the shop they should be looking at data as to why people become toxic in the first place and find solutions for that.","replies":[{"poster":"Tele","date":"2016-06-14T01:59:46.825+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"League's community is the **only** priority for the Player Behavior Team.

Once it's complete, it will open up opportunities for the player behavior team to add new systems and content to the client.\n\nThe player behavior team already knows a good deal about why people are toxic. **Lyte** did some revolutionary research for the gaming industry in this field for **Riot**. You can find some talks he did [here](http://gdcvault.com/play/1017940/The-Science-Behind-Shaping-Player) and [here](http://www.gdcvault.com/play/1022160/More-Science-Behind-Shaping-Player) if you're interested.","replies":[{"poster":"Bunny","date":"2016-06-15T00:59:49.812+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"You only have to look at the history of Riot to see that player toxicity isn't a main priority. You said it yourself that most things are overshadowed by champion releases and more exciting content, which is probably skins, so that indicates where their focus is. I'm not bashing Riot or trying to start something here but I do want the overall game play experience to improve.\n\n Their focus is on making money and it always will be. If toxicity was important they would of released an update with being able to separately mute peoples pings instead of spending countless hours designing Hextech Crafting. I'm not saying that will single handily destroy toxicity but it will be a great stepping stone towards improving game play. \n\nI don't believe for a second that there is a large focus on toxicity and there might be a team but I can believe it's probably 4 guys who work part time as opposed to the 50 in skin design. You don't have all the answers I'm sure but if you have someones ear you have the chance to improve the game. \n\nI think most people who play League, specifically ranked, don't enjoy the game that much in comparison to other games. But we play it because of the grind and the small reward of climbing that division. I think we would enjoy it a lot more overall if we weren't experiencing that 2/5 games where everyone on your team is arguing in the game chat because they're all tilted. \n\nAnyway, thanks for replying, have a nice day.","replies":[{"poster":"Tele","date":"2016-06-15T05:55:20.783+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"_**There's a big difference between saying Riot's efforts aren't working, as opposed to Riot isn't doing anything.**_ I think you might be getting them confused.\n\n> \"Their focus is on making money and it always will be.\"\n\n\n+ Absolutely true. At the end of the day, they are a just private company like any other.\n\n That said, don't forget that toxicity is one of the largest reasons why people uninstall League. If more people play League, more skins are sold. Therefore it's in **Riot**'s best interests to get rid of toxicity and keep Summoners playing for longer.\n\n> I can believe it's probably 4 guys who work part time as opposed to the 50 in skin design.\n\n+ The Player Behavior team has [34 full time members](http://gdcvault.com/play/1017940/The-Science-Behind-Shaping-Player), of which 3 have a Ph.D. These people are going in to work 40+ hours a week to try and reduce the impact toxicity has in League.\n\n I don't know if the skins team is larger. They probably are, but I strongly doubt they have anyone with a Ph.D on that team.\n\n__*\n\nTo be fair the player behavior team has been a little slow recently, but it doesn't mean they stopped caring.\n\nJust wanted to clear that up :P","replies":[{"poster":"Bunny","date":"2016-06-16T05:02:55.001+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Haha well it's interesting to note that they have a Ph.D and I hope that helps them.
