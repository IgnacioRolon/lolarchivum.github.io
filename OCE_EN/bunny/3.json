Take for example **Rumble** jungle, **Nautilus** support, **Morgana** support... etc.\n\nI do understand though, it super annoying for me too when I get someone who's not trying to innovate and just wants to play a sub-optimal pick. I consider it the price we pay for giving people the freedom to innovate and play what they want.\n\nDon't forget that dodging is always an option too. It's far better to loose 3 LP and no MMR, than 20 LP and some MMR.","replies":[{"poster":"bgentle2myashe","date":"2016-07-12T01:51:08.186+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Actually, I agree, you can't prove intent and in reality it would be hard to justify and possibly police locked roles because it would actually stop meta changes and the development of the game. In that respect I think maybe I have been a little eager due to my own bios of experience. For that reason I will say I can see both sides of the fence. For the games sake, I guess locked is a bad idea. For the sake of maybe less experience players who just want to have fun and enjoy a game with mates or solo q, then I think it's Riots call and the people who lose out based on the decision have to suck it up. \n\nFor what it's worth, I will give a shout out Rengorax and apologize for my over eager judgement and retract my previous statements.","replies":[]},{"poster":"DipperOCE","date":"2016-07-12T04:19:17.231+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Wow. Even a green shares this closed minded view. \n\nWhat if you had entered that game and he turned out to be a god, carried your team and you won? But no. You think it is \"a risk\" and don't bother playing. It is the same as trusting a random player with a meta pick, they could go really bad, but just because they are playing a pick that you consider more fitting, you go into game.\n\nIt can make me nervous when I'm in my promos/provisionals and have a off-meta or as you say \"sub-optimal\" pick, but it is much more worth to play the game. New things happen all the time. If someone picked the Mordekaiser rework in your promos before any LCS games, you would either dodge or label them a troll. But oh after the pros play it it's ok. And when it gets nerfed and buffed for top lane, that's fine.\n\nPeople playing different things is the only way this stale meta is going to change. Right now, every game looks like this.\n\nADC: Ranged carry champion\nSupport: Tank or healer\nTop: Tank, bruiser or duelist\nJG: Tank or assassin\nMid: Assassin or mage\n\nWhat if I tried Thresh top out in someone's promos? They would probably get mad at me or dodge. But if you think logically, it actually makes a lot of sense. Tanks are initiators and need cc. The only reason Thresh is weak tank wise most of the game is because 1. He has to leave farm to ADC and pick up Relic Shield 2. He has to buy support items\n\nSo imagine if he could just start with full tank/cdr items, go into maybe a ZZ'Rot or an Ohmwrecker for diving. Then he would actually nearly be as strong as Sion, and with ranged empowered auto attacks as a top laner it could be a very strong pick.\n\nBut I guess since we all live in this basic, boring world of: \"you can't do that because I've never seen it so it must be bad\". I mean, if you just play the game even trolls don't hold you back. They are there to have fun, not ruin your games. If you just play the game they troll the enemy, tilt them and you end up winning.\n\nThe fact that you tell people to dodge because they don't like a pick is fair, and your option, and your opinion. But you can't tell me that the meta has never been innovated. You clearly agree with this above. So why is it that you say it is a \"risk\" to play a game with these picks. If they lose lane, they could have just as easily lost lane as a meta pick. People feed all the time. \n\nYou are the type of person that wants to blame it on the pick unless I am mistaken. The problem is the people who will go in stupidly, die and then be like \"report this Thresh trolls in my ranked game that's what norms is for.\" Now I know you don't say this, don't blame your team, and most importantly don't go in stupidly, but there is no reason to label a weird pick or even troll pick as bad until you are 100% sure it was the weak link in your team, and you lost the game.\n\nIf you dodge and never enter the game, you will never know if that pick could have been godlike and won you the game. You never know for sure if it was as bad as you say. At the end of the day, ranks are important, I get that. But if this game needs anything right now it's innovation, and not the same old thing as we slowly climb and for what purpose?\n\nAgain, just my opinion, but there is a reason we both have opinions, and a reason Riot will never impose artificial and locked metas. They never have, never will, and it will never be report worthy. If they INTENT feed, that is when you report them.","replies":[{"poster":"Tele","date":"2016-07-12T07:29:55.130+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"My bad ahah, I don't think I was clear enough in my original post.\n\nLemme try clear it up :D\n\n+ I'm all for innovation. Around 20% of the champs we have now aren't played in their intended role, and that's real awesome. It's much healthier for the game when the community decides the meta IMO. Personally, I hate champions like **Kalista** because she was designed to only be playable ADC.\n\n To be clear, locked roles is a terrible idea because all the awesome Korean hidden OPs and NA secret picks would no longer be playable. \n\nHowever, **you can't really blame anyone for dodging a game they don't think they can win.** \n\n+ It's more about winning than being against the off-meta pick; if you lock in a **Soraka** Jungle and link me a 80% OP.GG winrate.

It's not my intent to just be close minded and tell people they can't play a certain champion in a certain role. When Riot creates a new champion they have a specific lane and a specific goal in mind for that champion to accomplish. There are reasons why champions are less effective in certain lanes.\n\n\n Personally if someone took a champion like Lux into the jungle in my ranked game I'd be pretty mad because it's just ineffective and creates hard work for not only the person playing them but their team. I think yes you should be reported if you pick something troll like Lux jungle because it doesn't just effect you but your entire team.\n\n\n There is also a reason why Anivia is not a good ADC so why pick it if it is going to result in a loss. It is a team game after all and we should all consider other people when choosing champions. Yes it is fair to say we should all play what we want but there is such a large champion pool that people are bound to have play styles within each role that suit them. \n\nIf they get jungle but they really really want to play Lux they should pick a jungle champion to win the game and do what is best for the team then go play a normal with Lux or queue for mid (even support).","replies":[{"poster":"DipperOCE","date":"2016-07-13T11:23:44.849+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I know you don't intend to be closed minded, but you just are. You have labelled Lux Jungle as troll, report worthy and game ruining without seeing it. You said you would be mad if someone picked it with no greater knowledge than that they picked it.\n\nRiot designs champions with a lane/role in mind, yes. But that doesn't always turn out to be the best, or at least not the only role they work in. Example: tank Ekko jg. They designed him to be a squishy ap assassin mid lane/top lane, but instead a few weeks later he was primarily a tank jungler.\n\nYour points don't make any sense, and to prove you wrong I will explain a few things. First of all, have you seen Karthus jg? He is a somewhat squishy mage for mid lane. But he can be a lot stronger jg, because he can farm effectively, gaining his core items without the stress of assassins stopping him, he has a lot of slows built in especially when he gets Rylai's, his clear is very quick and healthy, and his ultimate becomes 10x more effective when he can use it at any moment instead of having to walk back to fog of war or 2nd tier tower.\n\nLux jungle is very similar, and she makes a lot of sense as a jungler. Of course she will never be put to as good use as mid or support, but as a jungler she definitely isn't troll. Her clear with a 2 unit bind and 2 time shield, with a good aoe ability that also slows multiple units, she holds up well. She provides a lot of CC against a melee dominant role. Her ganks are good due to her high range and offers a shield for teammates, she obviously has a lot of CC to help get kills, and the same as Karthus, her ultimate gains a lot more opportunity and surprise than lane Lux.\n\nAgain, she will never be as good as lane Lux, or as useful, but it is no where near a \"troll\" pick, and will never be report worthy.\n\nThis is why Riot doesn't share the same view as you, and it isn't report worthy, and most of all they not only can't lock roles because of impracticality in lane trades, but also won't because it ruins innovation like we always see.\n\nThank you, I would like to end this discussion here.","replies":[{"poster":"Bunny","date":"2016-07-13T11:35:36.909+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Most of the innovative picks come from Korea with a lot of theory crafting involved to create those new builds that are off meta. I don't think a lot of the people I play with in Silver and Gold are theory crafting at all when they pick off meta champions. \n\n You basically prove my point yourself by saying Lux jungle will never be as good as lane Lux. My point is jungle Lux is for normals and ranked Lux is for lane. You pick your strongest champions and the strongest champions for those lanes to give you the biggest chance of winning. Of course if you are a God at jungle Lux and can go positive and have a large impact then sure. \n\nBut most people don't practice these champions in off meta lanes or with off meta builds and put their entire team through 20-30 minutes of hell because they want to test something. Therefore it IS a troll pick if you have no idea what you are doing in a ranked game. Pick it in normals and it isn't trolling because I consider that to be a non competitive testing ground to get you ready for ranked.\n\nYou also cannot just express that you would like to end the discussion here when I have had no chance of rebuttal.

But people who voted yes for this are just plain stupid. You can't lock roles for positions, just because people can't accept playing off meta picks it doesn't mean they are bad.\n\nExample: Sion support. Before the koreans played it? You would've been flamed for picking it. Tank Ekko? If you think back to before anyone realized how good it was, you would've had those first few players that tried it out in ranked.\n\nIf you want me to put it in perspective, the most wins from off-meta picks come from games where their team doesn't flame them. Let that sink in. In fact, most of the times the fault lies not within the pick but a different player who makes a stupid play, dies, and then says something like: \"F*** this (champion) (role), normals are for fun picks ranked is serious.\" or perhaps \"Why do you have to ruin my ranked game\".\n\nAnother point, people swap roles all the time. It's why Riot not only includes the swap to help picking contested/counters, but also for swapping. If I meet a player who wanted ADC and I wanted Mid, we will ask to swap and then do it, picking the off champions. But if those picks where locked the picking phase would be screwed up and/or we would be put in off-roles.\n\nOverall, sounds like you are just salty that you've had a really bad Teemo support, who just plays it as a gimmick. It's because they are a bad player, not because they picked Teemo.\n\nAlso, because I want to cover everything in this comment, in response to Justkillmealredy, no, normals are not the place for \"trolling and stuff\". If people TROLL your ranked games, they deserved to get banned. If they pick an off-meta pick and you complain all game about it instead of just playing, you deserve to get banned.\n\nThe same with normals. If you want proof of this, watch Disco Heat's League of Children series. It usually goes like this:\n\n1. He shows a bunch of games where he absolutely dominates as the off meta pick, enemies not really knowing how to play against it.\n\n2. He shows a game where he gets flamed from the start for picking it, tilting him but he pulls through and makes it a victory even though people think it is retarded.\n\n3. He shows a game where he start going bad as the off meta pick (happens eventually), and people flame him, and then because their rage is misdirected, they intent feed, afk and troll. They are the problem with the team.\n\nBasically, if you had a support that fed as Leona, you probably wouldn't get as mad at them. That just doesn't make any sense. Off meta picks are not a problem, the player using them and going bad isn't dumb for picking that champion in that role. But they are not performing good.\n\nThey could feed just as easily on any other champion, I mean we all go bad sometimes, but sadly people judge themselves and other players on 1 individual game. If you compare score instead of just getting on with it, sure they may not be going good, but you are the problem.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL6YZkeWa4hQV73_NHf3gMaJsStPDZU4nY","replies":[{"poster":"bgentle2myashe","date":"2016-07-11T14:54:05.669+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Of course there are exceptions to the rule which should in all fairness be compensated for.
