With the new splash arts it seems as though they&#039;re incredibly over sexualized and over stated to the point where it makes me feel uncomfortable. I&#039;m using Evelynn here as an example but even some of the splash updates for Caitlyn and Miss Fortune are over the top. \r\n\r\nIt&#039;s normal to have beautiful females in games as most people want to look at something pretty and not ugly but I feel like these new splash arts for Evelynn, at least, belong on the advertisement page of Pornhub for some cartoon fun time (if you&#039;re into that). We all like a bit of chest wobbling and booty shaking from Miss Fortune but I feel like these splashes go to far.\r\n\r\nThoughts?","replies":[{"poster":"Maraudaur","date":"2016-04-28T01:16:39.529+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hi!\n\nSo I answered this in another thread but we recently did a global splash unification. Not to be confused with splash updates.\n\nhttp://boards.oce.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/miscellaneous/2NU8KHEA-when-you-update-splash-arts-riot?comment=0001\n\n> We had two major goals of the Unification:\n> \n> Unify the representation of all characters to achieve global parity between splashes. A League of Legends champion shouldn’t be different solely due to where you are in the world. A consistent high quality splash should represent a character equally for all players.\n> \n> Fix internal development issues. In line with making our work more efficient, we often analyze areas of redundancy to get rid of problem areas. Each time we have a new splash created, it’s typically an unruly amount of work to determine if a region should obtain the new splash, keep their own, get it into their build, etc. This can lead to things such as Tencent getting their patches a week later, which isn’t fair for their players, and has rippling impacts onto the eSports scene.\n> \n> Let’s be clear - many of these assets are not permanent, and don’t meet our quality bar. We had to make a decision on many splashes to take either one or the other- even when both weren’t great\n\n\nJust to be clear the ones you've shown are splash unification (unifying all global splash arts across all regions with existing artwork)\n\nSplash updates look more like this\n**Old Eve**\nhttp://static1.eclypsia.com/images/lol/champions/Evelynn_Splash_0.jpg\n\n\n**New Eve**\nhttps://2.bp.blogspot.com/-cqp4Kwkuyds/Vw6QJOvIo7I/AAAAAAAA500/Tkwtl57Ek_QxEetrHOvKa8_CK05ips1rQCLcB/s1600/Evelynn_Splash_0.jpg\n\n**Old Warwick**\nhttp://vignette1.wikia.nocookie.net/leagueoflegends/images/a/a5/Warwick_OriginalSkin_old.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20120609050852\n\n\n**New Warwick**\nhttp://vignette4.wikia.nocookie.net/leagueoflegends/images/6/6c/Warwick_OriginalSkin.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20120609083423","replies":[{"poster":"Bunny","date":"2016-04-28T01:36:45.360+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"They are still \"new\" splashes to the Oceanic community but I understand the point you are making.

Is it fair to say \"Well evelynn doesnt conform to the way i think things should be! remove evelynn splash from game plz for not being normal!\" what does that say about the women that are into that kind of thing? pretty sad to them aye.\n\nThere are lots of people in the world, males and females that are into that whole spiked-leather/mistress thing, so of 130 champs (soon to be 131, and ever growing) don't you think its fair to have just 1 single champ that appeals to those people? Thats like saying: \"Jesus and shit is the one true god, all other ones are false and should be abolished, plz remove Azir/Nasus/Renek/Illaoi it offends my belief.\"\n\nThere are champs that lots of different people relate to, for example I'm really interested in medieval Japan and Egyptian Mythology, so when i see Shen, Yasuo and Azir, i think 'wow this champ is just like me' so because of that connection i will pick Shen over evelynn, and Azir over Lux, and Yasuo over Jax. Because Eve, lux and Jax's themes don't do anything for me, but that doesn't mean that  they wouldn't appeal to someone else. Someone who is interested in the 'magical girl' genre might always pick Lux over Azir, and someone who likes that spiked leather theme might pick Eve over Shen. Would you deny that person the champ that they can relate to?\n\nIm not saying that all eve's are kinky, just like i wouldn't say that all Azir's are egyptologists. But that is an aspect of eve that may relate to a whole different section of the population that we know little about, so whats the harm in letting them have their champ? they don't complain that you get to play your Lux, so why should you stop them from enjoying their Eve?\n\nThats just one interesting angle i decided to take, i have argued this point a thousand times again't feminist Zelots and am so bored with the typical arguments i have to give time and time again, i could give you all the normal arguments but thats no fun, so this is a more interesting angle.","replies":[]},{"poster":"GigaPube","date":"2016-04-28T22:08:29.143+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"ugh....one of THESE posts....","replies":[]},{"poster":"Devils Advocate","date":"2016-04-28T01:53:49.275+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Gaming will be sexualized for a while to come unfortunately, with such a young hormonal player base trying to be realistic about how female characters look will not make the same amount of money.\n\nMost of the art contain Barbie doll syndrome.
