This thread is here for people to put in their ideas regarding this skin. What champion would you like to see with this skin and what kind of effects would suit.\r\n\r\nMy first thought is maybe Vi since her Q and her R could be potentially animated as actual tackles.\r\n\r\nFor the skin maybe chroma packs for different teams. \r\n\r\nAlso maybe Lee and he could be running around with a footy and throw one at enemies and jump and tackle them.","replies":[{"poster":"Lord Sesshomaru","date":"2015-11-11T17:28:11.631+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"AllBlack rengar, he already does the haka so why not","replies":[{"poster":"Tentacle Touch","date":"2015-11-11T20:21:07.251+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"He should be Ma'a Nonu!
