Nevertheless I propose if you were Last Pick in your previous match the next match you queue up for you shouldn&#039;t be last pick! That way you have a less chance of someone picking the champion you want to play, especially if popular at the time. It&#039;s not a huge change but definitely just a small quality of life change.","replies":[{"poster":"Omni Presents","date":"2016-01-03T10:36:47.815+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It won't really help, players either tend to call what they want and bitch and moan until they get it, or take whatever they want when it is their turn regardless of anything, when the 2 clash, it turns everything to shit.\n\nYou seem like the type of person who regardless of position will go on what people called, I say just get used to calling your preferred role faster and hope for the best, or be ready to sacrifice and take what is needed.\n\nIn an ideal world you take what you want when it is your turn and everyone else has to fall in line unless people communicate before hand.\n\nTo answer your query, pick order is random, it used to be highest MMR first, but they changed that.","replies":[]},{"poster":"CHEESYLEEKS","date":"2016-01-02T12:03:48.196+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"i like the last pick, lets you counter your opposing role. if you keep getting stuck with the same position try saying, can i play (position x) because i can counter (enemy laner x) hard with (champion x).\n\nfood for thought.","replies":[]}]}
