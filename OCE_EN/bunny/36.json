Can't get out of G5-G4","subforum":"Miscellaneous","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I&#039;ve been up and down through G5 and G4 several times where I will just get promoted and demoted over a few games. I&#039;ll generally get to G5 lower LP and go and a massive winning streak. Once I get into G4 I can make it to around 50-90LP and then I&#039;ll go on a massive losing streak. There seems to be a huge inconsistency with my teams when I&#039;m going through these phases. \r\n\r\nMy win streaks I&#039;ll generally get a good team where no one feeds and we all go even or at least win lane. When I go on my losing streaks I&#039;ll get a lot more flamers, toxic players and feeders. To start my losing streak I had a 4-19 Vayne on my team and I realised my losing streak had begun for the third or fifth time.\r\n\r\n I know most people are going to tell me that I&#039;m being gated and it&#039;s the systems way of telling me I&#039;m exactly where I need to be but I feel like I&#039;m not even getting a chance to carry at all when my team is going 0-7. I&#039;m not blaming just my team and I feel like there are some games were I could of performed better but 8/10 I&#039;ll do well but not well enough to 1v5 a fed team. \r\n\r\nI don&#039;t know if this is happening to anyone else but I&#039;m kind of sick of not being able to climb any further because the matchmaking system just puts me with low silver/unranked versus plat last season G3 &amp; G2 and I wish I was exaggerating. \r\n\r\nI&#039;m a pretty decent support so if you&#039;re around G4-5 and an ADC add me IGN: Bunny   \r\n\r\nAny insight / tips would be appreciated. \r\n\r\nThank you!","replies":[{"poster":"Rocka","date":"2016-07-26T04:32:30.478+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"hi i added you in game if u wanna duo","replies":[]},{"poster":"bgentle2myashe","date":"2016-07-26T04:09:50.682+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"At least you got that far..!
