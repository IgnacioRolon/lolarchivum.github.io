I want to make a bit of a list here with you guys of the ones that I&#039;ve seen and some of the ones that I think we should change. There&#039;s definitely some that can be used for &#039;tactical tilting&#039; on the enemy team but sometimes people go a little far like saying &#039;this team gives me cancer&#039;. That last phrase can affect people pretty heavily if they&#039;ve known someone who has had their disease and it&#039;s really not something that is okay to be joked about. If we have better attitudes towards our games I feel like the community we have created here can be a less toxic environment and everyone get get what they want.\r\n\r\nTL;DR,  Comment below the most used phrases in your tier and say whether you want them to stay or go\r\n\r\ne.g. &#039;This team gives me cancer&#039; --- go!\r\n\r\n&gt;&gt;&gt; This by no means will weed out ALL of these phrases but lets hope it can at least effect one person and make one game less toxic, it could be your promos!","replies":[{"poster":"EzeBlood","date":"2015-11-09T07:13:05.196+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"\"wtf, noob jungler\"\n\nGet this line out of all my games omfg I hate it.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Robo23","date":"2015-11-08T10:52:37.120+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"gogogogogo, baron buff + ace","replies":[]},{"poster":"Azirious Mistake","date":"2015-11-07T22:50:13.850+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Not even close baby","replies":[]}]}
