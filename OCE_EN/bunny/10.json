[POLL]","subforum":"Miscellaneous","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I see Riot have changed new champion release prices to 7800 IP instead of the standard 6800. Whilst this is a small deterrent it also just pushes people to buy new release champions with RP so it&#039;s pretty disappointing on Riots behalf. Instead of increasing the price to 7800 IP for a week perhaps Riot should disable the new release champions from ranked for a week. People who are thirsty enough to play the new champion will take it straight to normal giving them  a lot more practice before ranked. This would in fact I believe decrease the amount of trolls with newly released champions. \r\n\r\nhttp://imgur.com/GB6v7ui\r\n\r\nThis was a game from this morning a day after the champions release. I know all new Taliyah players won&#039;t do this but I feel like whenever new champions are picked that team is at a disadvantage.","replies":[{"poster":"Gait ","date":"2016-05-21T17:40:36.066+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Champs are always 7800 for their release week.\nIt will go down to 6800 next week, just wait or play like four games?\n\nEdit: i'm an idiot and didn't read the entire post.\nImo new champs should be auto banned in ranked for like two weeks, or until you have some semblance of mastery on them.\nAn I don't even play ranked.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Knuuckles","date":"2016-05-21T01:33:13.741+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"You just got a bad player, taliyahs play style isn't that hard to grasp, I played her in ranked and did exceptionally well","replies":[{"poster":"Bunny","date":"2016-05-21T01:40:18.226+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Well, she thankfully wasn't on my team, but perhaps you're just a really good player.
