As of right now, that was roughly 12 hours ago.  The season has ended, but that doesn't mean that Ranked is no longer available... \n\nInstead we're in preseason - with all of the changes that go with it! Ranked will remain on during preseason as with previous preseasons.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Gehirn","date":"2015-11-11T00:34:27.215+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Season rewards will be based on your rank at 12 AM on 11th Nov AEDT.\n\nRanked will remain turned on as normal throughout the preseason.","replies":[{"poster":"Jimbo Mon","date":"2015-11-11T00:41:10.425+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"when are rewards handed out then?","replies":[{"poster":"Gehirn","date":"2015-11-11T00:48:17.230+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Rewards are being handed out between now and the end of Nov 17th.
