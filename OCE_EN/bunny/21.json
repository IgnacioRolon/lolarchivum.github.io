Let me highlight some Summoners comments in case you didn&#039;t have a chance to read them. Of course you can read a whole lot more here:\r\n\r\nhttp://oce.leagueoflegends.com/en/news/champions-skins/skin-release/galaxies-crumble-cosmic-reaver-kassadin\r\n\r\n----\r\n&gt; Alright, I don&#039;t comment much but I feel the need to let my frustrations be known. Either we shouldn&#039;t have to pay for the server skin or everyone in every other server should have to pay for theirs. There is enough discrimination against OCE in terms of over-costed games etc. I expected better of you Rito.\r\n&gt; I donate to charity already and would rather it come off my tax than yours. Would make an exception to that if it wasn&#039;t our SERVER SKIN. In fact people would probably be praising you for the charity if it wasn&#039;t the server skin.\r\n&gt; \r\n&gt;  Tristicus  - about 14 hours ago\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n&gt; We got a free Pool party Ziggs skin as a placeholder. And now, 2 years down the line, this skin was made a server skin as an afterthought, and we still have to pay. \r\n&gt; \r\n&gt;  Metroxis  - about 16 hours ago\r\n\r\n----\r\n\r\n&gt; And so did Russia who actually got 2 free skins at launch and then also got their server skin for free some months later. Or Turkey who got 2 free skins at launch, one being their server skin, and then a second server skin a year later.\r\n&gt; \r\n&gt;  Faleriana  - about 20 hours ago\r\n\r\n----\r\n\r\n&gt; I have more than 30 skins including almost all legendary skins but I will NOT buy this skin as a protest to the fact that we have to pay for our server skin. Rito for really? we have to pay for our skin?? Bulls*t!!  . If charity is your excuse let the whole world do charity with a separate charity skin or even a charity bundle. I will surely buy that whole bundle. But this is soo bs. Server skin should be free.\r\n&gt; \r\n&gt;  deamonpog  - about 16 hours ago\r\n\r\n-----\r\nNow in my own opinion I think all of these people have valid concerns. When watching the video the skin did not even look as nice as i thought it was going to. He literally just looks blue, I can&#039;t even see the stars except for recalling. \r\n\r\nQUESTION: Did any of you actually ever suggest having the Southern Cross as a skin idea?\r\n\r\nWe&#039;re going to be stuck with this unless we as a community take control and raise awareness. Feel free to discuss below.","replies":[{"poster":"CadoAzazel","date":"2015-10-19T02:56:17.684+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"I wrote a few large posts on the 2 skin articles  here's some copy pastes sorry its long and without the context, want to see context I was replying to go to the 2 skin articles\n\n\"because we were told that for putting up with a constantly lagging crashing server we would get a free oceanic inspired skin as turkey, Russia and other new regions had all just got region inspired free skins.\"\n\nMoney the public donates to medical research is mainly spent in administration. Also the money spent in research is only helping the big corporations patent new drugs to make a fortune off of, don't donate money to medical research unless that research organisation is owned by the community/public, every country has its own research centre for every disease / drug, all competing to discover the same thing 1st hiding their ideas and innovations from each other, slowing the progress and process down. Your not making a difference donating money to medical research your supporting the hypocrisy that it is. \n\nIt also shines in Africa South America and Antarctica, so its definitely a symbol representing Oceania isn't it........ lol /smh\n\nThey should have done an Anivia of a Bird from the whole area\n\nYep lets donate, So that they can patent more drugs off our money to sell back to us at ridiculous prices our taxes then subsidise, and then riot can claim all the money for this charitable action of theirs as a tax deductable donation\n\n\n\nAnd the really long negative but true rant\n\nYeah really great skin ......... (sarcasm) It represents Brazil and South America and Africa as much as it represents Oceania, the southern cross is in the Brazil national anthem so really oceanic, specific.\n\nPool party ziggs was a free skin to entice people to move to the oceanic unstable often unplayable beta server with the promise we would get a free skin futher down the track.\n\nYAY ITS FOR CHARITY! (so riot can claim most of what they pay to charity back in tax offsets getting the money anyway)\n\nBUT MEDICAL REASEARCH MAN! WE NEED TO STOP CANCER! ............. Stop eating sugar and processed carbs and excessive amounts of meat if you really care about these causes. Donating money to charities just gets lost in administration costs, and if it does actually get to the research scientists, whatever they discover is patented by the multinational psychopath corporations and sold to us at ridiculous prices, it may say $24 in the Chemists, but your actually paying $160 for it through the government paying most of the costs with our taxes. So no, donate to charity, good on ya, really making a difference and help curing the symptoms not the actual problems/cause.\n\nSo yes, Fantastic Amazing skin so pretty I will ignore rational thought and buy it.\n\n\"Your just crying coz you cant afford to spend money on it\"....... No, believe me I can afford it, I have spent money on it in the past, but I wont be spending money on this after riot said it would be free.","replies":[{"poster":"Project Xayah","date":"2015-10-20T07:15:27.935+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> They should have done an Anivia of a Bird from the whole area\n\nThis was actually suggested by the community back before the boards were a thing, but I'm pretty sure a Rioter didn't comment on that.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Bunny","date":"2015-10-20T07:09:42.911+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Good post!

Not only can the southern cross be seen in pretty much all countries in the southern hemisphere but it's actually on the flag of Brazil, who have their own LOL server and received **FREE** server skin(s). The way I see it is that Riot just wanted an excuse not to give us multiple server skins to better represent the region and thought slapping the southern cross on just the splash art would fool everyone.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Alfawarrior3","date":"2015-10-16T23:16:22.029+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"do you really think this is gonna make a difference?","replies":[{"poster":"Bunny","date":"2015-10-16T23:33:35.288+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Alfawarrior3,realm=OCE,application-id=Ntey9fRZ,discussion-id=50FixXhb,comment-id=0001,timestamp=2015-10-16T23:16:22.029+0000)\n>\n> do you really think this is gonna make a difference?\n\nIt doesn't matter if it does or doesn't as long as people can have their opinion and if that is a majority opinion then they can get heard.
