In no way do I think I&#039;m a great player  but I also don&#039;t think I&#039;m a terrible player. I generally do the best on my team every game but all the other lanes seem to go 0/5 and 1/7 and so on. \r\n\r\nI don&#039;t know if this is just me or the way that the matchmaking system works or if it broken, I don&#039;t know. But 9 games is so rough. Last season I Gold V but got demoted due to inactivity and I never had this issue in that tier. Is anyone else experiencing this sort of matchmaking? If so please comment below so if there is an issue with matchmaking Rito can fixo. \r\n\r\nThanks","replies":[{"poster":"ThatsBS","date":"2015-10-06T02:21:54.631+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Now Bunny,\nI know it sucks, but if you are always the best on your team you will climb. It may take a lot longer then a guy next to you who is at the exact same Elo as you. Meaning it's the nature of the game. Iv got a mate who has made gold every time since season 2. He's currently silver 3 and played a lot of games. He's not worried cos ge know ls he will get there. But may have to play a lot or a few games to get there. Like I said it's the nature of the game in solo que.","replies":[{"poster":"Bunny","date":"2015-10-08T08:26:56.293+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thank you!
