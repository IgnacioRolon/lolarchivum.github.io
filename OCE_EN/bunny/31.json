I know you can mute pings but that&#039;s not the greatest solution to this issue because sometimes the other 3 people on your team are actually helpful and smart with how they use this feature. \r\n\r\nI propose we initiate a feature that allows you to block a players pings if they are misusing this feature. The button can be right next to the mute communication button.","replies":[]}
