It actually has nothing to with the Tribunal. The tribunal is in a rework at the moment and isn't active in any regions, this is a result of the beast of a instant feedback system which is basically an automated system that looks at a whole bunch of things to determine punishments (or lack thereof). This is just proof it's doing its job :)\n\nI should also note that only those who reported the player in the last game (the one that triggers the punishment) receive a notification, which is why so few people actually see these.\n\nCongratulations on getting one more deserving player punished!\n\n{{sticker:slayer-jinx-wink}}","replies":[]},{"poster":"Toxic Shaco","date":"2015-11-26T23:59:35.378+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Just because people get punished, doesn't mean it works.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Tele","date":"2015-11-25T10:08:09.028+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I have had this notification once in 2 years playing League.
