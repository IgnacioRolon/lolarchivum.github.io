Playing solo is super aids anyway.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Ingénue","date":"2016-04-08T17:11:19.213+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Even though it may seem like everything suddenly gets harder when you are in series, nothing has actually changed. You are still getting matched with/against players you would encounter in any of your other ranked games at your current MMR. \n\nIf you main support, there isn't much you can do differently to what you have been doing up to this point. \n\nGeneral recap:\n\n**1. Be encouraging!**\n> What I mean by this is that when you are playing solo queue you will play with all types of players. Ones that are having a good day, those who aren’t ones who are in the middle. When you are playing support try to keep your teams spirit high and be the voice that your team needs. Sometimes people say that a simple smile can make peoples day, a simple gj in chat after someone gets a kill in your lane or another can do the same thing. While you are doing this as well you will notice that your team will start paying attention to the chat a lot more because of you making it is a positive envorement. With this in mind use this to your advantage to make shot calls for the team. Call rotations, ward placements, keep the team focused what needs to happen next so they can all follow the same goal!\n\n(Wonderful advice from LGC Elam [on this post](http://boards.oce.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/miscellaneous/f0m8TsM4-im-problem-as-a-support-player))\n\n**2. Ward machine!**\nKeep your wards up. Warding smartly means your team will be able to more effectively control the map and you are going to be able to make decisions without hesitations. \n\n\n**3.  Join a premade team to avoid potatoes!**\n [I always suggest joining a premade team](http://boards.oce.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/team-recruitment). You build relationships, can learn to fit with each others play styles, have A+ communication and avoid toxins like feeders/afks/general potatoes. With all of the incentives being thrown at you such as, increased IP, mastery points and hex tech stuff, there is literally nothing to lose \n\nGood luck, may the elo be ever in your favour ♥","replies":[]}]}
