Anyway a small quality of life change would be that it defaults to &quot;show owned&quot; being turned off. I feel like more people are going to go to the store to see new champions they don&#039;t have instead of ones they already own.\r\n\r\nThoughts?","replies":[{"poster":"Mortis Ex","date":"2016-07-30T06:59:41.496+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I totally agree, defaulting to show owned is bloody stupid imo. And its not just the champions, skins, icons, runes etc all default to show owned. Get it together rito.","replies":[]}]}
