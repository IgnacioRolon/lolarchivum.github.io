I&#039;ve been playing ADC/MID exclusively and tend to do well in lane where most games I win or go even. I start to get on a 60% win streak then my matchmaking throws me some curve balls and matches me with unranked people. I know what you&#039;re thinking, yes they&#039;re unranked, but they have the same MMR. You&#039;re right but the fact that this is their first ranked game this season really shows and I was lucky enough to get two on my team. In the last 5 games I&#039;ve had a feeder 10+ deaths and one ADC AFK. \r\n\r\nIs the best way to climb with a partner who has higher MMR/rank then you or to slug it out solo. So far I&#039;m still only earning 14LP and losing 22LP. I was hoping it would of evened out by now but it hasn&#039;t and being matched with horrible teams is really what is letting me down. I know you&#039;re expected to carry but surely it&#039;s not expected to carry 4v6 every game?\r\n\r\nIf anyone is keen to duo let me know and if you have any advice on this matter let me know.\r\n\r\nhttp://oce.op.gg/summoner/userName=bunny","replies":[{"poster":"4fy9bEOt7y","date":"2016-07-05T09:09:22.165+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"ELO hell doesn't exist. If you cannot climb, then you're at your correct level.\n\nYou'll gain poor LP until this: _408W 415L_ is fixed. You'll climb as long as your W/L ratio is positive.\nWe're both G5, yet your MMR is 1,268, whereas mine is 1,604. Of course, you have 800 games, where I have 60, but still.\n\nI'm not going to duo with you and Gold has horrid players, boosted kids and other animals, but you can carry in this MMR easily. If you're good, you'll win -- but at the same time, not all games are winnable, you have to accept that. Most of my losses are simply because I got top when I'm a midlane one-trick.","replies":[{"poster":"Bunny","date":"2016-07-05T09:59:22.523+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Fair enough. I know ELO hell doesn't 'exist' you're always just lower MMR in your current bracket and that's why you can't climb. But it does feel like hell when you're G5 versus low silvers and teamed with the same. I feel like it's a lot easier to carry when your team knows not to feed or has some map presence/awareness. I definitely think the higher MMR it is definitely noticeable more often that teams will be better in that regard. \n\nSo duo or solo doesn't really matter it's just about the W/L ratio?

I'll do better if my team has the basic understanding of the game and don't walk around in circles doing bronze things. But at the same time you should be able to carry against low silvers because of your ability. The best thing to do is when you lose 2 games in a row, go and play a few normals and relax. You're tilting yourself if you keep playing through losses. Don't play normals to win, just play and relax. Try and play a champion that can hard carry. Don't bother with tanks or supports because you cannot hard carry with Janna -- you can peel and save your ADC, but if your ADC is a monkey, then it'll do no good.\n\nGold, in my opinion, is bronze 2.0. Everyone in this MMR thinks they're a God and the best. Take Rossboomsocks for example, he's trash and he's gold. Plat and diamond are a little better, but the 4 and 5 parts of each division are horrid. I play solo. I've duo queued a few times, and each game has gone wrong. I prefer solo.\n\nclick the 'Check MMR' tab on OP.GG. It's inaccurate, but it's pretty good.","replies":[{"poster":"Bookbash","date":"2016-07-06T00:50:21.461+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Annie Bots Wife,realm=OCE,application-id=Ntey9fRZ,discussion-id=h1Mb9js9,comment-id=000000000000,timestamp=2016-07-05T10:09:33.805+0000)\n>\n>, but the 4 and 5 parts of each division are horrid.

Riot kept secrets to stop manipulations but if you think about the game from the same level you probably do and accept that that's how things are, you'll probably perform bettr but not only that, relax and have fun - which is what it's all about.\n\nYou learn from doing or watching so if you want to get pro, watch pro's or play more - practice more, educate yourself - asking how to climb and asking questions that are probably on your mind are two different things and using other peoples psychology doesn't unlock things like training yourself on aspects of the game and understanding the game and all they'll usually do is pat you on the back or tell you to push/farm/split push/gank/lane freeze/make calls/roam/focus objectives/focus/stay positive/learn counterpicks/learn mechanics/learn builds/get to know your enemies too/prioritise targets/indicate strategies/give tips/give ideas.\n\nMost things like these work on your base knowledge and if you dont learn things like this you wont come up with your own ideas or know the base rulings of the game to be able to even correctly identify and adapt to peoples tips or situations. There are billions of situations in the game and if you know the basics, which you can learn through things like lolwiki-champion-strategy section or by checking out pros builds and guides on things like warding or even checking streamers because a lot of other people adapt to their ideas which are usually (for pros) copied so even if you dont want to copy you can adapt based around metas. Abuse the meta/adapt to it.\n\nIf people just tell you to CS and you're versing a Nasus you're going to get stomped on. Most tips people give you point at learning the game. Quoting your stats doesn't indicate your skill level. You seem smart. I was Gold 2. I stopped playing for a bit and deranked on adapting to ranked again (I would have practiced normals but the game is different there, with no metas or try-harding so you dont catch up with the meta in norms, let alone catch onto favourite of the months etc and because of the different attitude in ranked, games progress differently and just checking up on champ changes and stuff helps but if you take a break from ranked and go back in it can be difficult - which to me just goes to show that practicing -in- ranked is important; and even though there are no guarantees - there are abundances of the same thing which can be abused; but can also be used or turn against you.\n\nBe careful blaming your team, because that's what you're doing - it's easy to lose faith and once you have given up, you're a liability and you're no good to anyone. It's like Shinji from Evangelion, he's a useless whiny little b-tch that has to get dragged from place to place, carried and told what to do - turning into what you hate just makes you the same and that's not carrying, that's not turning games. (What, you wanna fkn dominate every game, or blame your team for taking it harshly when its low elo and its not fun getting stomped when you cant see the goals ahead of you) [having goals is important, if you cant see them - you might slow down not knowing you could get there quickly or easily] Also, getting dominated happens. Be realistic please. People can go from -relaxed- to hyped mode for 3 games then feed 5 games in a row based on their psychology and easily punish a bunch of golds as silvers because they are difficult to guage with a simple ELO equation; plus it can be luck based.","replies":[]}]}
