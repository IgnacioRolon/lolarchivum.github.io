Leavers and RQ","subforum":"Miscellaneous","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"http://oce.leagueoflegends.com/en/news/game-updates/player-behavior/play-games-matter/remake\r\n\r\nIn light of the recent post on the League of Legends news page I started to think about how this would help. It seems like a quality of life update which is really good but it doesn&#039;t really target the entire issue. It is quite rare that people will AFK within the first 3 minutes without any deaths. People usually AFK because of the deaths and because they&#039;re behind. So why release something that only targets a quarter of the issue at hand. I haven&#039;t refined this thought entirely and wanted to take it to the forums for some brain storming but why not implement a system that will help with leavers as a whole. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSo I ask you this: If in fact you encounter someone who rage quits after the 3 minute mark and has given First Blood what then?","replies":[{"poster":"Gait ","date":"2016-05-19T15:35:19.542+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Why not have another queue in ranked where you can join into an afk's game and take their champ over for the remainder of the game.\nMake it a vote thing again.\nGive the joining player the amount of passive gold they would get from time and items. And income from farming at a 60-70% accuracy for the lane they are in from the time of DC.\nThe queue would work kind of like a quest board i guess? You can see the champ, lane, time elapsed and score. Get bonuses for joining and winning and reduced penalties for losing.\n\nJust a thought i guess :o","replies":[{"poster":"Anthropicus","date":"2016-05-19T23:31:02.646+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Interesting thought, This would have to be a queue for people that own every champion ? If riot let people queue with the possibility of playing a champion they don't own/never played before it may end up being better that they just had an afk....\n\nwhat if you do disconnect.... 90 seconds is a reasonable time to restart  your computer... imagine you go to log back in to find someone has replaced you and you lose LP when you could have come back and played.\n\nIt would take massive brainstorming to come up with a solution. I think the best solution is to leave it as is.","replies":[{"poster":"Bunny","date":"2016-05-21T01:07:15.095+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I do like Gaits idea although it does need refining. I think definitely have to already own the champion and also be similar MMR. Perhaps you have to have at least mastery rank 3 or even 5 before being able to queue. If that person has disconnected for at least 10 minutes. I think 10 minutes is reasonable to fix the problem.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Anthropicus","date":"2016-05-20T00:09:24.317+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Bunny,realm=OCE,application-id=Ntey9fRZ,discussion-id=5sH7O5Zk,comment-id=,timestamp=2016-05-18T23:25:01.509+0000)\n\n> So I ask you this: If in fact you encounter someone who rage quits after the 3 minute mark and has given First Blood what then?\n\nThen you play 4v5 and report them for going afk.

As gamers themselves, they know how frustrating this is. \n\nI think the big issue with implementing the same system past the 3min/firstblood mark is that somebody can take the fall for their premade if they start losing (i'm pretty sure thats why they have the D5+ competitive integrety thing that will target everyone in the premade), or people can just as easily bully a random into afk. \nIt would also be frustrating as heck to be playing a game for 20+ minutes, to be winning and to have some random on the enemy team quit and if a /remake was cast you didn't get your LP or you get significantly reduced LP (which would make for a very slow climb). Personally, I can imagine that situation a lot.","replies":[{"poster":"Bunny","date":"2016-05-19T00:48:30.539+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yeah, that's the thing, you don't want to be playing a match for 20 minutes only for it to then go 4v5 and the match remake. This way the team who may of been winning has invested 20 minutes into a match they will ultimately gain no LP from. Perhaps a system can be implemented where it is possible to /remake post 20 minutes and both teams have to have majority consent. The system takes into account overall scores for each team and decides which team was winning from the point of the /remake command. Whoever was winning at that point will gain a small amount of LP and the losing team only loses a small portion of LP as well. This way it's not a complete loss for either team but also not considered a fair match.","replies":[]}]}]}
