The wards are still on the accounts, it is just not shown on the menus. In some cases people can't change wards in champ select either.\n\n[Don't worry, Riot are aware of the issue and are working to fix it](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us).","replies":[]},{"poster":"Ace","date":"2016-08-11T23:49:44.180+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yeah I noticed the same thing 2 nights ago, it's strange to look at without the ward skins in champ select, If you want to change ward skins you could always go to shop and click on a ward skin that you own and select it as your current one. I'm assuming there was a bug relating to the ward selection and that's why they removed it.","replies":[]}]}
