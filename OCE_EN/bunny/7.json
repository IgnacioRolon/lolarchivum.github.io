Even perhaps a report button for the chat room and a dodge. But if you use it to often without purpose your account then gets a warning for abuse of power.\r\n\r\nThoughts?","replies":[{"poster":"Noumea25","date":"2016-04-21T01:49:39.383+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Just so you know, if you dodge the penalty increases the more times you dodge in a 16 hour period. http://leagueoflegends.wikia.com/wiki/Queue_dodging\n\nIf you have to dodge, dodge and take the 5 minute penalty and 3LP.\n\nYou should also note that dodging doesn't affect your MMR, only your LP. The LP lost wont matter at all in the grand scheme of things so dodging to avoid a troll is always the smart move.\n\nif you get 2 or more trolls within a 16 hour period its always harder to decide if dodging is worth it because of the 30 minute penalty and 10LP you lose. It comes down to if you think there's a shot at winning or not, if you're 100% sure you'll lose then just dodge. Save yourself the 30 minutes it takes to go through champ select, loading screen and 20 mins of gameplay before a surrender. LP loss doesn't matter really, because your MMR isn't affected.","replies":[{"poster":"RonyStark","date":"2016-04-21T01:58:27.401+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"this is the reason why I only play in average 2 games a day","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"RonyStark","date":"2016-04-20T04:44:30.153+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"sometimes I feel queuing LoL is like playing Russian roulette","replies":[{"poster":"Bunny","date":"2016-04-20T08:49:09.165+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Haha this is so true.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Er√∏se","date":"2016-04-21T12:55:08.879+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"This is why I never play ranked anymore. I was silver 3 last season and my highest rank is gold 3 ( on another account) but this season I won 7/10 provisional games and got bronze 2. I honestly don't wanna climb since last 3 ranked games there was an afk and my team was arguing everytime one of them died. I suggest playing premade until you are gold +. I have posted something similar in another thread that you made http://boards.oce.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/miscellaneous/sbkyhw97-unrewarding-gameplay-the-climb\n\nIf you are looking for a duo partner then add me!\nIt helps having 1 less retard on the team XD\n\nIt was not that hard climbing out of bronze and silver last 2 season but this season is just really tough for me.\n\nI try and help other lanes but after they get an advantage they always do dumbshit like engage on 1 v 3 and when I tell them that they should not do that they always respond with \"HAHAHAH LOL YOLO\" or \"Stfu you bronzie\". Like honestly just play premade until you are gold+ cause based on my experience gold+ is not that hard to win games in since most of the gold players have a BASIC knowledge of the game.","replies":[]}]}
