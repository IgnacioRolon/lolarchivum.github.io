Or with scorecard, so that people can't play a certain way to abuse it for hextech rewards (though I'm pretty sure everyone has already worked out how rating system works and what the minimum requirements are to get an S+ on each champion cough..cough...logarithmic by gamelength... cough).","replies":[{"poster":"Omni Presents","date":"2016-09-25T06:58:23.923+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Honestly, the entire game is flawed and no matter what Riot do, it won't help.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Nightjar","date":"2016-09-25T06:28:50.168+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"because people can be trending up or down quite a lot and it just makes moving about the rankings alot more fluid, faster and fair.\n\nImagine someone in gold 2 who hasn't played in months and is now around silver 4 level or imagine if you did bad in placements because of feeders  and ap garen mids and got bronze 3 when you should really be plat 5. MMR would be much quicker to pick up on things such as a huge winning or losing streak allowing the system to adapt and matchmake much more accurately with less overall information to better place the individual in the correct tier for their level of play. Like population sampling in statistics by 5's, the system is better at working out what lp to award people when there are alot of random factors to deal with, mainly the winning and losing trends of the players. \n\nBy using mmr, matchmaking can more quickly adapt to the correct ranking and it also helps make sure that certain elo brackets like bronze 1 and silver 5 don't get too congested, especially at seasons end. It also makes climbing when you get placed in the entirely wrong elo alot faster since if you're on an unstoppable carrying win streak, your mmr will quickly begin to rise, well before your rank can catch up, allowing you to get matched with stronger opponents and earn more lp earlier, which makes long distance climbing faster.","replies":[{"poster":"Nightjar","date":"2016-09-25T06:31:20.519+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The main issue with the mmr system can come to light though near the end of a season too though, since when considering a very small number of games, the mmr system can easily misplace you. MMR is designed to work best over large numbers of games which can lead to idiots like me getting super inflated elos. I should be bronze 4 but right now because I only just got into ranked and haven't played many games, I got placed silver 3.","replies":[]}]}]}
