Giving power to silver players was an actual joke and troll by Riot Games.\n\nHow can you sit there and say that players are being banned for griefing games when the same people having been griefing games for months on end with no punishment. Legitimately, explain to me how a laner rolling into the jungle, taking it all from the jungler, and then spamming emotes is not considered griefing. Tell me how a support intentionally ruining the wave is not griefing.\n\nYour system cannot detect griefing at all, else I wouldn’t have been able to grief hundreds of games without a single punishment for it. I open my mouth and call someone silver and I’m muted, but I can legit make my team lose games and mask it as a mistake and force them to rage and it’s completely fine.\n\nDo you understand how many times I have stolen buffs from teammates and watched them alt+f4 or swear at me then report them and see that ban message pop up?

The thing to keep in mind is that there's a lot of factors about the situation that may make it *seem* like they don't, and even so I doubt you'll find someone who wouldn't say that the punishment system just isn't as efficient as it should be regarding gameplay offences. One thing to keep in mind is that gameplay offences are a lot harder to verify compared to other types offences. For example, it's a lot easier to see that someone is being blatantly racist to another player than it is to distinguish between a genuinely bad player and someone who is *intentionally* playing badly.\n\nWith that said, there's a couple things I just want to note about this situation. Firstly, the Tribunal was removed on *all* servers years ago (OCE never actually had a Tribunal) because it was vastly inefficient. For example, the community often voted for unnecessary punishment/over-punishment, meaning almost every case had to be manually reviewed, whereas the current system can manage being largely automated. It took several weeks, if not months, for basic punishments to be implemented, the kinds of punishments that the current system can manage in under 15 minutes etc.\n\nSecondly, and I know it wasn't mentioned but I just want to make sure everyone is aware, while the Instant Feedback Notifications are a *great* way to know when someone you reported has been punished, they shouldn't be relied upon for complete communication. They're often unreliable, not showing up when they're supposed to, and often only showing up for the *most recent* reporting player. You should never assume a player *hasn't* been punished just because you didn't receive the notification.","replies":[{"poster":"Hawckey","date":"2019-03-15T03:25:42.935+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"bro you're nuts, it is SOOOOO easy to soft int in this game and get away with no consequence, but god forbid you use a meanie feefee word cus riot will slap that ass with its authority of righteousness","replies":[{"poster":"Exarch Leona","date":"2019-03-15T05:31:16.544+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I had softdrink go through my nose. \nAbsolutely savage. \n\nAnd true which is worse.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Bring me my belt","date":"2019-03-16T11:12:13.647+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Hawckey,realm=NA,application-id=T8eq2lFQ,discussion-id=cayPmEh5,comment-id=00020001,timestamp=2019-03-15T03:25:42.935+0000)\n>\n> bro you're nuts, it is SOOOOO easy to soft int in this game and get away with no consequence, but god forbid you use a meanie feefee word cus riot will slap that ass with its authority of righteousness\n\nYou would be surprised with how much greifing you can get away with.  on top of that I got told by a single person in one game last night, to kill myself,  go back to f****** kids.  bet that guy just only received a chat restriction xD.\nYet I loose my cool for one game nothing racial nothing abusive just aggressive chat and I get penalized, but the people trolling and griefing in game won't get penalised any time soon. \nI am just at the point where I have music in the back ground, and if i get trolling i mute pings, emotes chat and do my own thing.\nI do strongly agree in game behavior is stupid right now, because people are learning to just int instead of flame","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Exarch Leona","date":"2019-03-14T07:20:17.109+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> They're often unreliable, not showing up when they're supposed to, and often only showing up for the most recent reporting player.\n\nIf they could fix this so I can see how many of my reports get through, that would be great.
