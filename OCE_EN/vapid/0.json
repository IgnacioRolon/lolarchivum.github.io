Not often at all I've seen red activity. I would go as far as to say they treat this board as voodoo lands.\n\nOn that note, not many people actually reply/participate in discussions in general. They just come, make a new discussion about their personal problem, and then leave when it's been solved.\n\nAs for what to expect from here, you'll really only get community support, and by community support I mean people also saying, \"I'm getting that as well, how fix?!\"\n\nCall me pessimistic.","replies":[]}]}
