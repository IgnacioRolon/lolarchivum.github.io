Any questions/tips etc leave a comment below or add me in game IGN- Yasho\n\nFor my idea, I&#039;ve come up with a skill set that could work well in the jg and possibly top lane. This champion is a Tank/Assassin, He fits in with the assassin play style of sneaking up behind people and completely destroying them or just going face first, but to balance that out he&#039;s damage is reduced. Having tank scaling this assassin now becomes a great front line force to be reckoned with. He has a slim character design wearing a long black cloak and a black shady looking hat with some thing to cover-up a bit of his face. He wields a pistol and a sword/dagger\n\nPassive - &#039;Champion&#039; gains an empowered attack every 3 auto attacks, he shoots his pistol at an extended range, dealing 30+ - 150+(Bonus damage scales with ad) damage and stripping 5-15% of the targets armour for 2 seconds (Lvl 1-6 5%/lvl 6-12 10%/lvl 12-18 15%)\n\nQ Ability - &#039;Champion&#039; Throws his blade, if a target is hit it will deal 80-210 damage (Bonus damage scaling with AD)(goes through minions but will mark upon large jungle creeps) slowing them by 25-50% leaving him unable to auto attack, but this will leave a mark on the target. If activated in the next 3 seconds &#039;Champion&#039; will appear on the opposite side of where the blade connected to the target and he will fire his pistol into them dealing an extra 40-175 damage (Bonus damage scaling with AD) and slowing them again for 10 - 30%\n\nW Ability Passive - &#039;Champion&#039; has mana/hate. Hate is built up with items that boost &#039;Champions&#039; health but in return halving his mana(If player obtains muramana they will have 500 extra mana instead of 1000). Hate gives bonus 5%-10% lifesteal(In combat) and 5%-30% movement speed(out of combat). Champion receives 5 hate upon killing minor units and 10 upon killing large units, 20 for champion kills/assists and regenerates 2 every second.\n\nActive - &#039;Champion&#039; Channels his hate into his powerful pistol and fires a shot at the enemy dealing 150-350 damage+(50-200 extra damage based off of the amount of hate used) to the target hit (scaling with AD for the target hit) and 100-250 damage+(35-100 extra damage)(burn will not effect target hit) in an AoE burn (scaling with HP)(AoE will be a small cone behind the champion hit)\n\nE Ability - &#039;Champion&#039; channels 10% of his current hate into his blade, thrusts in one direction a short distance then thrusts himself again. During the thrust he will cut through several enemies beside him dealing 70-150(Bonus damage scales with HP), but on the second thrust enemies hit on the first thrust can not be hit for another 7 seconds therefore they will receive no damage on the second thrust. Has a charge system so he can only dash twice every 20 - 15 seconds (with CDR)(also during the thrust he can interact with his q and w)\n\nR ability - &#039;Champion&#039; sacrifices 25% of his current HP and all of his hate and channels it into his blade and pistol, greatly enhancing their capabilities (will go through some physical metamorphosis). This will last for 9 auto attacks(10-20 seconds based off of level), it will give all his auto attacks strong AoE attacks and he will receive extra 5-15% movement speed, his attacks with his blade will deal 50-150(scaling with HP) extra damage and his pistol will do an extra 25-100 damage (scaling with AD).\n\nJust a couple things to mention. All his abilities apart from R will require mana. His Q will use just mana, his W &amp; E will use hate and mana but mana cost will be lower and his R will take HP and all hate. And for his HP and Hate, he would generally get to around 3000-4000 hp. So hate will be capped at 500, so basically for every 100 hp is 10 hate and every 1000 is 100 hate but you start with 100 and by the end of the game can reach 500.\n\nBasic Lore\n&#039;Champion&#039; Comes from Demacia, he was outlawed after he committed high treason against the king, but due to his outstanding military record they spared him. He travelled to Ionia and got a house, started a family and joined the Ionian Military during the war. He was a commander during this war, he lead hundreds of men from Ionia but he did not realise that during a battle his men disliked him so much that they betrayed him by stabbing him in the back a few times, once the news broke out the commander was dead, even though he wasn't, the Ionians fled. He woke up in a Noxian cell and there was a man in front of him trying to talk to him, but he was still dazed from the attack and unable to speak.\n\n2 weeks passed he was still being held in the prison, left wondering where his battalion was, when they would rescue him. But he overheard the guards talking about that battle and what happened to him. He decided he wanted blood. He waited for the guards to open the cage and attacked. He took their swords and killed them all. He gathered his gear and ran for Ionia. He was outlawed in Demacia, and now his new people hated him. He was filled with hate, vengeance and the thirst for blood.\n\nHe made it to Ionia, Slaughtered the men who betrayed him, and went home.....\n\nBut he did not know what to expect. He&#039;s home had been destroyed. Noxians had attacked it and destroyed it. They killed his wife and they hung his son.\n\nHe was now filled with complete hate, he had nothing left, nothing to return to, so he decided, that he will honour his title, The Exile of Civilisation , and slaughter all those that stand before him with arms and he would do this, weather or not someone was paying him.\n\nCan&#039;t think of a name for this guy\n\nIf you got to the end thank you, um yea this is basically what i had in mind, let me know what you all think, just a to refresh your memory I&#039;m thinking this champion to be like jungle or top lane.","replies":[{"poster":"Star","date":"2016-09-15T12:41:52.128+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'm gonna be honest, this guy sounds broken. \n\nHe's got twitch ult (that lasts even longer and gives him MS [and also scales with AD?!])\n\nHe's got zed's q-w as his q. \n\nHis w is like aatrox but even stronger, and he has triple gap closer. \n\nTo make this guy balanced, you'd either have to remove the damage aspect completely for 2 of his basic abilities, or half his damage, give him huge cooldowns and remove some gap closer abilities (probably all of them).\n\nNot trying to bring you down, just some honest advice. :)","replies":[{"poster":"Yasho The ADC","date":"2016-09-18T04:24:35.635+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Star,realm=OCE,application-id=hIjvqaz6,discussion-id=AcToj676,comment-id=0001,timestamp=2016-09-15T12:41:52.128+0000)\n>\n> I&#x27;m gonna be honest, this guy sounds broken. \n> \n> He&#x27;s got twitch ult (that lasts even longer and gives him MS [and also scales with AD?!])\n> \n> He&#x27;s got zed&#x27;s q-w as his q. \n> \n> His w is like aatrox but even stronger, and he has triple gap closer. \n> \n> To make this guy balanced, you&#x27;d either have to remove the damage aspect completely for 2 of his basic abilities, or half his damage, give him huge cooldowns and remove some gap closer abilities (probably all of them).\n> \n> Not trying to bring you down, just some honest advice. :)\n\nThanks for the feedback but this is an old concept with older ideas.\n\nHere's the newer concept with a quite a few tweaks and changes.\nhttp://boards.oce.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/player-creations/81GJxvp1-the-expatriate-of-civilisation-updated-concept-maraudaur","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"EzeBlood","date":"2016-09-03T00:26:08.771+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"How about we call this one 'Amos'.
