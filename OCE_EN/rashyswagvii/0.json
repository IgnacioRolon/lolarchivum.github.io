He's tough, rock solid & a decent support. One fateful day, I was looking at custom LoL skins. I happened across a particularly nostalgic skin called Old Shopkeeper as Malphite. I immediately installed this & prepared to play it . Unfortunately, it didn't work. I have now come here to preach my message. Please make this skin a reality. Make it a real League of Legends skin for at least one day. I cry every night for Malphite{{champion:54}} . I pray to him.  All respect Shopkeeper Malphite. **ROCK SOLID**","replies":[{"poster":"DavosTheArgonaut","date":"2014-12-03T09:45:49.834+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Shopkeeper {{champion:22}}  looks really gud i love{{champion:31}}","replies":[]},{"poster":"Flynny","date":"2014-12-03T09:44:05.580+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"i strongly believe that this should be a skin as it brings back memory's and i would defiantly buy this 10/10{{champion:54}} #rito plz","replies":[]}]}
