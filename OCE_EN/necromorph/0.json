I understand that when you win games your mmr goes up etc, but when theres only 3 of you and your highest summoner is a bronze level 30, why would you be getting put up against duo golds and silvers etc?  I&#039;m getting pretty tired of having to put up with constant losses because these people are just way out of our skill level. Its putting my friends off playing with me and I don&#039;t really know what to do about it.","replies":[{"poster":"BarryButcher","date":"2015-04-06T04:21:01.650+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"Normals are Normals...
