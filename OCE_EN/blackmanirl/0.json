I actually love what they have done.  Good job riot, but one small problem your lock in feature is causing every player to undergo grief\r\n\r\nReasons why the Lock in Feature needs to be removed:\r\n\r\n-Experienced players are not use to locking, thus higher elos suffer the most\r\n\r\n-The punishment does not suit the crime. Failing to lock in should not result in a 30 min ban. \r\n\r\n-40 min to get a game, because everyone forgets to lock in, hence they get banned for 5 min, thus extending que time because we need to find players that are not suffering from the &quot;time period ban&quot;.\r\n\r\nSorry for sounding like a nagging wife riot, but please fix this issue. \r\n\r\nI love your game, but this is a huge a turn off.","replies":[{"poster":"Zorphiax","date":"2016-01-22T14:13:35.076+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Riot will probably just say the same thing they said to most people after the new hud came in which was basically:\n\"Get used to it.\"\n\nBut to be honest I would like it removed (even as a low elo player) a lot of people aren't used to locking in and it is going to affect a few people in promo games when they forget to lock in and lose there promo game because of it.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Geryer","date":"2016-01-22T12:01:56.664+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"l am used to waiting for time up when selecting champion, this is a problem for me.
