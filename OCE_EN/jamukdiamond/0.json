Mastery tokens are what you use to upgrade from Mastery 5 to 6, and then 6 to 7. You earn M6 token by getting any S grade on a champ you are M5 on. M7 is the same deal but you have to be M6 and the grade has to be S or S+.\n\nEarning chests is a bit different. You earn chests when you or someone in your premade gets an S grade, but there's a bit more to it.\n\nFirst off you must have a chest available, you get one available every week and can have up to 4 available at a time. \nSecond, you can only earn one chest per champion per season, so if you've already earned a chest on say, Kassadin, you won't receive another one even if you get an S.\nThird is you can't be loot restricted, but this one's pretty obvious since it tells you at the end of every game if you are. (You get loot restricted from recent punishments like chat restrictions).","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"killerdj","date":"2017-05-02T10:57:54.000+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"{{champion:161}}","replies":[]},{"poster":"jamukdiamond","date":"2017-05-02T10:39:10.663+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"{{champion:161}}","replies":[]}]}
