It's well understood that internet issues or client crashes happen, and a few dcs here and there will not net you a leaverbuster punishment. \n\nHell I play on pretty dodgy adsl internet and even at it's worst (daily issues) I never faced a punishment. How is this relevant to you? It takes a pretty unstable connection to net you leaverbuster punishments, especially up to multiple 20 minute waits. \n\n> **Everytime you dc, especially for extended periods of time, you are negatively affecting the experience of 9 other players. **\n\nThe short of it is that the more you dc the more people you affect and you will face longer waits faster as a result. There is a point when it does not matter if it is directly your fault, you know you are going into a game where you will likely dc and ruin other peoples' experiences, and from the sounds of it you have faced multiple 20 minute leaver busters.\n\nMy advice,[ troubleshoot your connection](http://boards.oce.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/help-support-oce/MOopB6Wt-experiencing-a-tech-problem-find-the-common-fixes-here), talk to your ISP about it if you have to (and try using ethernet if you're on wifi), and if you are having client issues as well [follow the fixes for those](http://boards.oce.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/help-support-oce/MOopB6Wt-experiencing-a-tech-problem-find-the-common-fixes-here) as well.","replies":[]},{"poster":"erich24q","date":"2016-06-05T11:13:22.238+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=erich24q,realm=OCE,application-id=ElA0rvVL,discussion-id=8O0hy3EK,comment-id=,timestamp=2016-06-05T11:12:47.267+0000)\n>\n> i think that riot should stop putting leave busters on their account because the game had crashed for has been disconnected from the network issues or internet difficulties they have. i had a leavebuster again, from my disconnections because the game had said &amp;quot;your game had crashed.&amp;quot; and i quit the whole game to restart the connection and next thing you know after tyhe game i got fkn banned for no reason. it was not my fault. why are they banning people that shouldn&amp;#039;t be banned. this is also an advise for riot so they don&amp;#039;t lose leaguer&amp;#039;s just for stupid disconnections. fix this. i now have to wait 20mins for another 5 games.
