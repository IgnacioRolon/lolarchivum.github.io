No of course not they would want me to either grind like 50 games to get a key and hope on a skin fragment or would want me to buy RP and buy keys with it.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Iosua Bot","date":"2016-05-25T07:03:06.459+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"That'd be a good idea.\nBut just remember not to be scammed xD\n\nE.G:\n\n1 skin for the price of 2, unless ofc it's a really nice looking skin","replies":[{"poster":"Bugsplat123","date":"2016-05-25T08:08:35.792+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Haha, thanks man :3","replies":[]}]}]}
