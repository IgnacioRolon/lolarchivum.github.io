About 25% of the time it will work as normal, the other 75% it will say there is an error joining the game and to check my firewall and reconnect. I have tried disabling my firewall and it does nothing. The only fix I've found is to close and open my client and reconnect to the game. This has about a 75% chance of working - sometimes it takes me 3-4 times of opening and closing the client. This is incredibly annoying as I'm often way behind by the time I get into the game.\r\n\r\nAny suggestions on how to fix this? As I mentioned, this does not seem firewall related despite the error message. It has also been like this last patch too.\r\n\r\nThanks","replies":[{"poster":"HORSE OF FORCE","date":"2015-01-24T23:41:04.154+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"That could be a result of not [renewing your IP](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues#wq9) for a long time.
