I just have to close the game and wait for few minutes until it just decides to work again.\r\nSo here are the 4 different bugs I&#039;m experiencing after the new client.\r\n\r\n1) Play, store, loot, collection, etc buttons on top of the start page is randomly gone. I have to re-open client just to get these buttons back on screen. SO ANNOYING.\r\n\r\n2) Client randomly closing for no reason. My internet was fine, fps and ping was fine but suddenly it freezes and shuts down.\r\n\r\n3) I cannot re-join when my game crashes. Even if I reboot my computer and log in again, there is no &#039;reconnect&#039; button. \r\nThe screen just says &#039;game in progress&#039; or something like that. I tried shutting down the client by task manager (It wouldn&#039;t shut though), I tried rebooting my pc but still no &#039;reconnect&#039; button. \r\n\r\n4) lastly, When I&#039;m not in game, just chilling on chat or looking through store, suddenly pop-up appears saying &#039;trying to reconnect&#039; and it suggests whether or not I wan&#039;t to exit the game instead of waiting. My internet was stable all the time this happens. Yesterday it was really bad because it happened every 3-5 minute or so. I tried repairing, re-installing, changing DNS, etc. The DNS thing worked for a while but doesn&#039;t last long.\r\n\r\nPlease fix these bugs. This new client is giving me cancer 24/7. \r\nThank you.","replies":[]}
