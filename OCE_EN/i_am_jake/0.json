I dont know what is happening at first i thought it might have been me cause of tilt but in all my games i have been going positive and trying my hardest to carry but it just seems like my team dont have the skill level in the mid-late game. If anyone has any tips on how to get out of this losing streak please comment.","replies":[{"poster":"Justify","date":"2014-12-24T06:53:11.199+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"lol u care about losing games in normals?","replies":[{"poster":"i am jake","date":"2014-12-24T06:57:22.025+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"no its just the fact that im even losing in normals as well not just ranked","replies":[{"poster":"Justify","date":"2014-12-24T09:48:08.801+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"you are probably toxic or raging irl, or on tilt.","replies":[{"poster":"Lnar","date":"2014-12-25T10:34:36.250+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"toxic or raging in irl?
