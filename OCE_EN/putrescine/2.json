I feel like a narcissist, but my strengths are my target priority, map awareness, with high gold (in some people's opinions) mechanics and willingness to recognise my mistakes. My flaws...well...I'm an infrequent warder and sometimes become an axecrazy shieldbiter on specific champions...Namely Darius and panth respectively. When I tried to team up with my friends, I found this had...less than ideal results. They were only silver and I dragged them way out of their depths, so I'm looking for a slightly more experienced team. \n\nIf it helps, I achieved second place in Maqlan (The largest LAN party on the eastern seaboard hosted by a uni) with a group of randoms who were just put together that day as a jungler and beat teams which had been practising for months. Granted our support was challenger and there was a jungle teemo at one point, but I feel we pulled out weight.\n\nIdeally the team would be semi-serious, with mature teammates (high eloquence [hehe...elo-quence] is a bonus) who have a similar skill level. Feel free to add me on LoL. I'm usually on if I'm not at work or grinding my way through Final Fantasy. Ping is usually stable but has bene acting up recently.\n\nEDIT: Dang...I just wrote a whole biography...","replies":[]}
