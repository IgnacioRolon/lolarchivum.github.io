A similar problem came up with World of Warcraft Legion where everyone got sick of the same green and black color scheme and I am now sick of the same crimson red covering every Noxus character. Because Kled is an outsider and not a traditional Noxian he avoids this lazy color design and Swain had also done this previously which made him interesting. It showed he was not a traditional Noxian and gave a mystery to where he came from or if he is even human.\r\n\r\nSecond is his models, nothing makes him stand out. Oh looks its an old guy in a black cloak isn&#039;t that interesting. Not saying that the old design was amazing or anything but it did the job giving him, at the very least, a non generic look. But his ultimate was where old Swain was great, you transformed into the gigantic crow like monstrosity as you ravaged the enemy team. New Swain grows small wings and glows red. Isn&#039;t that cool?\r\n\r\nTo summarize I really like the new kit for Swain and his abilities look good too, his colors (or should I say color) and his models both in and out of ultimate however are so generic and boring that it honestly makes me not want to play him. As it stands I will have to buy Tyrant or Northern Front Swain to get a some what interesting champion because the base one is Vladimir in a black cloak. I really hope Riot listens to the overall negative response to Swain&#039;s visuals and changes them.","replies":[{"poster":"Lord Sesshomaru","date":"2018-01-25T23:10:06.781+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Usually I would agree, typical red/black is overdone, its a colour scheme that makes kids go:\n\n [nasal snort] _\"But it symbolises blood and death! so badass! so cool!\"_\nhttp://media.animevice.com/uploads/0/9455/441300-screenshot091.png\n\nAnd yeah, sometimes It does work, like with the Nazgul for example, but that could be because they were pretty much the _original_ 'black cloaked figures'.\nMost of the time though it's just overdone.\n\nHowever! \nI think it works well for Swain. Not because it's original, but because it **isn't**.\nDemacia/Noxus is the typical good vs evil story in league. And the characters should reflect that. If you want really interesting and wacky characters look to Targon or to Zaun. \n\nDemacia/Noxus are _supposed_ to be generic, Garen is your typical hero character, Darius is your typical bad-guy commander. Thats the whole point of Demacia/Noxus, it provides a base for people to have generic characters, so that other nations can have more wacky ones, without the whole game being made up of crazy characters.\n\nSwain is the leader of a nation who's entire culture revolves around blood and battle, it'd be so out of place if he just rocked up in an orange shirt and jandals.\nOf course he would wear clothes that reflect his cultural background. \n\nIf it wasn't for his voice lines, old Swain would have had **absolutely nothing** to do with Noxus. He looked more like a witch from out in the swamps or something. He didnt look like the grand general of a country that relishes in battle.\nHis look was outdated and was made before Riot had fully solidified the themes of each nation. _(not to mention he was straight up hideous)_ I mean his crow was blue? who has a blue crow?\n\n\n_______\n\nAlso Kled isn't really an outsider.. He is an Icon of Noxus itself. he was fighting for Noxian land long before most of the Noxian champs where even born. and even he still wears red.\n\nNot to mention that not all Noxian champs wear the red and black anyway.\nTalon, Cassiopeia, Leblanc, Riven, all wear other colours. Thats roughly half of all the Noxians.\nHowever it is appropriate that their leader does wear colours that resemble the homeland, most armies do have a 'uniform' after all. And the Noxian flag is black and red.\n\nAnd its not like they don't have their reasons, Vlad wears red because he wields the power of blood magic, what colour do you want him to wear? Lime?\nTheir culture revolves around blood and battle, it's pretty standard that Red would be a big part of their colour scheme, like how the Spartans would wear red capes.\n\nAlso you say:\n> overall negative response\n\nWhere else have you seen negativity regarding Swain? because I haven't seen any?\n\nObviously this is all opinions, but I think the new swain is a definite improvement over the old one. Yes he is a bit typical, in the sense of his colour scheme and look. But thats a hell of a lot better than not fitting his theme at all like the old one.","replies":[]},{"poster":"SOOM","date":"2018-01-25T05:18:24.421+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I like the cape :)","replies":[]}]}
