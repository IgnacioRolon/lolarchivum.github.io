Some people just need that extra push. \n\nIts more of a matter of finding ways to reward summoners who aren't jerks (things like the clash limits and bettering the honor system) to further incentive's being either a neutral or positive teammate, as well as to continue to better the detection and punishment systems in place for antisocial behavior for typing and in game actions.","replies":[{"poster":"SirTiltsABit","date":"2020-01-14T08:56:28.131+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I agree with reason one, but not reason two.

In most countries, they're treated as being more about \"containing the undesirables\" (similarly to the \"prisoner island\" concept) rather than genuine attempts at reform, which is a major factor in reduced reform rates (there's a reason that Norway's prisons have the highest rate of success).\n\nUltimately, one of the best ways to help people reform is to treat them as much like everyone else (with the same basic rights) while incentivising reform, otherwise they'll tend to feel isolated and forgotten, which will just incentivise more destructive behaviour.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Testikills","date":"2020-01-16T09:06:35.924+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"I think the game needs to be looked at as a whole. Think about it most people who rage are the ones who think they are doing better then others, the game needs more ways to reward people who deserved a win but still lost, the game also needs a voice chat like every other competitive game on the planet.
