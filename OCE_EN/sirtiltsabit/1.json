Tired of pairing with randoms who would rather abuse you than actually working as a team?  Tired of people throwing games in ranked because that just can&#039;t be bothered playing properly because it doesn&#039;t matter for them? Looking for a team that takes League seriously? \r\n\r\nJoin me and my friends as we try and spread some positive attitude in the tiresome elo that is bronze. If we are lucky we may even make it out of bronze. We welcome all, we are happy to teach and give feed back. My friends list vary between bronze up to plats so we always have nice people to learn off.\r\n\r\nThe more the merrier. We take all comers. We mainly use Discord but Teamspeak can be used as well.\r\n\r\nComment on here so I can add you and let the fun begin!","replies":[{"poster":"Endless Heights","date":"2017-06-25T06:01:59.842+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"IGN: ThreshXG.

People who can play with players of varying skill levels and not quickly degenerate into a state of rage are pretty rare. And people have very different ideas of what a positive attitude consists of - some think that it means that everyone else does exactly what they say all the time, some think it means not caring about winning at all (I'd fall into this category), some think it means that winning must be achieved at all costs. In short, unless you're careful to ensure that everyone really is on the same page, trouble can ensue.\n\nThat said, good luck :)","replies":[]},{"poster":"NoobOfTheYear201","date":"2017-06-21T22:39:11.428+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"i want in","replies":[{"poster":"SirTiltsABit","date":"2017-06-22T05:59:44.510+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Sorry man, this is for the OCE server","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Main Line","date":"2017-06-21T09:15:10.908+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Do you guys play flex queue with 5 people?","replies":[{"poster":"SirTiltsABit","date":"2017-06-22T05:57:57.961+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yes, love flexing with 5 people","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"NoobOfTheYear201","date":"2017-06-21T22:40:05.541+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"IGN if NoobOfTheYear201","replies":[]},{"poster":"Effim","date":"2017-06-21T07:09:42.919+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"ign  Effim","replies":[]},{"poster":"Frog Man","date":"2017-06-21T04:46:41.422+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"IGN: PatrikkStar\n:)\n","replies":[]},{"poster":"FeedThePony","date":"2017-06-20T20:53:59.266+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"IGN: Buckets Baby :)","replies":[{"poster":"SirTiltsABit","date":"2017-06-21T02:22:02.207+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Will add when I log in!","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Sidmarill","date":"2017-06-20T20:45:11.530+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"This sounds really lovely.
