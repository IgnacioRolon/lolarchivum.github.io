I have been stuck in Bronze since AFK&#039;s and intentionally feeding trolls got me demoted to the dreaded Bronze. Since then I have been at the mercy of them as they constantly ruin games. In my last 5 games, I have had back to back feeders and AFKS. \r\n\r\nI have reported them, blocked them, kept the retaliation flame to a minimum, muted, tried my hardest and yet I am still plagued by them. It is never ending and I have spent enough money on this game to validate my say.\r\n\r\nStill though, why does Riot reward them? \r\n\r\nThey get what they want (the frustration of fellow team mates) and still Riot does nothing. These changes that happen are extremely minimal in my elo and I am also tempted to scrap this account and start a new one in a higher elo because Riot refuses to help any of us trapped in elo hell. They have cost me so many games where we going great because they didn&#039;t get a role they want, they lost early on or they started with the intention of losing.\r\n\r\nSo the question I put forward to the fellow community is this; why does Riot reward trolls?\r\n\r\nIt is extremely unfair that the action they take is very minimal, yet the inaction has massive repercussions for people like me who just want to get better?","replies":[{"poster":"Chris2fur","date":"2017-05-25T16:16:56.177+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"Context to my comment here.I am currently in que playing soloq at 4 in the morning on my smurf that is Diamond 5, main account this one Challenger. Looking at your op.gg you have really nice stats for Annie and your Vi both champions do well in low elo that is to say all way up to plat about. Everything else you play is garbage and your overall level does seem to be bronze. Your name also screams bronze. If you want to play this game to improve and not just here to have fun. Then take it seriously alright. Focus on yourself and what you could do better always. You will be making so many mistakes in your own games every single game that complaining about others makes no sense. On the point of fairness, everyone deals with AFK's, trolls, DC's etc. You are not special. Everyone is effected by it. It is the way you choose to deal with it that separates your from others. Coming onto the forums and making a whiny post is not one of those. You want to improve? Take it seriously, new name, follow the meta champions, i.e. copy what the pro players do, and always reflect on what you could have done better.","replies":[{"poster":"Akkordian Zoeve","date":"2017-05-25T20:10:16.158+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":4,"body":"Oh, look... another high elo player who looks down on us and doesn't understand what Bronze is like. You are constantly going on about the 40-40-20 rule, which doesn't apply in Bronze (especially low Bronze) because 100% of games have AT LEAST 1 feeder or troll or AFKer. Every. Single. One. If your team is the one with the troll/feeder, then no matter how well you play, you're going to lose because there is no counter play to a 20/0 Nasus who can 1v4 (remember that the troll isn't going to help, so it will never be a 1v5), dive towers, and split pushes all the way to the Nexus with no way of being stopped, all at only 20 minutes in. \n\nAnd even if you do manage to get a 51% win-rate, that still isn't good enough to climb (even a 66% win-rate isn't going to get you out of Bronze). \n\nSo tell me, Mr. Challenger Player, how would *you* deal with a 20/0 Nasus at 20 minutes into the game? **You can't**.\n\nJust because you're an all \"high and mighty\" Challenger doesn't mean you get to foul-mouth those of us in Bronze.  It's like if I beat up a kid for not knowing how to find the area under a curve. Just because something doesn't require effort from you, doesn't mean it's as effortless for every single person. You don't understand what it's like to be in Bronze. Even if you made a Bronze smurf, you would still be a Challenger player in Bronze, making 1v9ing easy. \n\nSo next time you're going to foul-mouth Bronze players for not \"putting in any effort\" or whatever other nonsense, and take your fingers away from your keyboard, rest for a moment, and **press cancel**.","replies":[{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2017-05-26T05:19:05.198+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"I've been in Bronze, I've been in Low Bronze, and it's far from every game. Sure they are more common, the frustration of Bronze is a big factor in that, but there is more too it. You know what most of you in this thread have in common? A negative perspective. Going into game EXPECTING something to go wrong pretty much guarantees that it will. Going into the game \"knowing\" that your team will be bad guarantees that you are going to see and focus on every single mistake they make, instead of the good plays where they accomplish something.\n\nSo immediately, before you have even entered the game you have pretty much assured first that you are going to be hating life for that game, second you are going to playing worse because you're worrying far too much about the petty mistakes of others, and third that you are far more likely to approach your team negatively in chat and in pings (doesn't have to be toxic, a simply negative attitude still has influence) which in turn negatively effects them and makes them play worse.\n\nBefore you have even gotten into game you have stacked the odds against yourself, and for what? To prove some arbitrary point that Bronze is toxic? Everywhere is toxic, so why would you contribute to that if you hate it so much?\n\nI have a smurf in Bronze now to practice ADC, since I'm a bronze tier ADC and I'll tell you now that is you approach games with a positive attitude, most people will respond in kind. There's always going to be those games with assholes in them, but everyone else has to deal with that too, at every level of play, so why is it such a roadblock for you and not for them?\n\nAs for your specific example with the Nasus. You don't. You don't deal with the 20/0 Nasus in late game you deal with the 1/0 Nasus in lane phase. Unless you are in bot lane (even then, some supports can influence things depending on their lane) then you can have a huge influence on that lane. You don't even have to kill him, you just have to waste his time and stop him from getting minions.

Don't even take notice of your rank, its irrelevant. Just play to improve, watch your replays, get a coach if you must, and listen to them - that can shortcut the process.

It not only relies on a large sample size at a given moment, it also relies on an even distribution of the feeders. For example lets say at a given moment the number of players logged into OCE are 10000 (out of the 230000 number of accounts), and 8000 of them are feeders or trolls (3% of the entire server). Statistically you are fucked.\n\n\"If your team has feeders, then the enemy team is **likely** to have feeders\"\n\nI wish people wouldn't use this argument. People generally complain when they get feeders more than one game in a row and on a given day you can have 10 games in a row with feeders or trolls or bad players **only** on your team. It's possible and it does happen.\n\nSo forget statistics when they involve chance.\n\nIt's better to educate the players how to react when you have feeders throughout the entire day. Things like taking a break, playing the next day. Or trying to be the player in the team that keeps morale higher. Or improving your skills knowing that you are going to lose the game anyways. Or trying some practice games in a different queue, for example.\n\nThere is no quick fix solution to feeders, afkers, and trolls.","replies":[{"poster":"Mozzie25","date":"2017-05-26T08:17:28.397+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"That is not how statistics work and as someone who works with statistics and big data it actually hurts to see someone misuse/misinterpret them so bad.\n\nThe whole point of having large sample sizes is to take out the element of chance. Small sample sizes can be effected by luck or selection bias. Example: If you flip a coin 5 times you might get heads 4 times and tales once. Leading to the statistics of, percentage of likelihood of: \nHead = 80% \nTails = 20%\n\nNow if you expand the sample size to 100 the number will normalize closer to 50/50. Even assuming you end up with more of 1, say 60 heads and 40 tails you'll end up with a percentage of likelihood of:\nHeads= 60%\nTails= 40%\n\nThat's why studies use large sample sizes to take chance out of the equation.\n\nHes right, **IF** your not a feeder then it is statistically more likely for their to be a feeder on the other team. Since you only have 4 spots for a feeder while they have 5. It is entirely possible for you to get feeders/inters 10 games in a row but it is unlikely.  I would even say its nigh impossible to get 10 games in a row with feeders JUST on your team. Most likely dude to perception bias you simply remember the feeders on your team while forgetting the feeders on theirs. Using your \"statistics\" up there and ignoring matchmaking. The chances a feeder while be on your team vs on there team are (Note: I am way simplifying this because I don't have the time or the inclination to build you a full on probability model):\n\nSince theirs a 3% of a feeder ending up any any of those spots theirs a 12% chance overall of you getting a feeder (3x4). Where as they have a 15% chance of getting a feeder (3x5). \n\nSo yes there is a better chance of them getting a feeder than you.\n\nEdit: Also I hate the fact you made me that guy on the boards that corrects peoples math.","replies":[{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2017-05-26T10:37:33.384+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"Exacta, and as much as I could have gone more in depth, these discussions get exhausting when they pop up once a week and you're just regurgitating the exact same info you did last time.

If we get back to the original discussion of why \"Riot rewards trolls\" it's simply because their reporting system is inadequate and cannot detect sophisticated trolls like [REMOVED] and his friend for example. Reward by incompetence if you like.\n\nI recently reported a blatant feeder (by using a support ticket because the end screen bugged out) and got no feedback on the matter... looking at this player today, they are still trolling in the odd game they feel like.

Ultimately it's the players that do this, and we as a community have perpetuated this idea that OCE is hella toxic (even though it really isn't all that more or less toxic that NA or EU, though certainly in a different manner but that's a cultural thing) and it encourages the casual toxics. We perpetuate this idea that nothing happens, when really it actually does but because there isn't enough in the way of feedback the players just don't feel it and it makes everything worse.\n\nMy biggest gripe with the IFS in it's current state is feedback. The system does far more than people realise, but there's not communication. There's only that one little notification that only sometimes shows up to a tiny fraction of people. Even if something as simple as a popup that said \"thanks for your feedback\" anytime you accurately reported someone (whether they were punished or not, first time offenders and all that) it would be a step in the right direction.\n\nIt's difficult to defend sometimes, but I do see it working, I can't deny that it does, but I also know that it struggles especially with casual (every now and again) toxicity and fringe cases. Fringe cases are always going to be hard for an automated learning system since there isn't a big enough sample size for it to determine if x behaviour is ok or not in the eyes of the community, and casual toxicity seems to be a struggle because it is infrequent enough that the system doesn't know when they've crossed that arbitrary and very subjective line.\n\nAll that said, I hardly think that Riot is rewarding trolls, and if any of my theories about the new honour system prove to be true I think that system will go a long way to improving the overall health of the community (positive reinforcement works a lot better than negative). \n\nWhen threads like this pop up I know where they come from, it's rather obvious in fact, but vast majority of the time the OP fails to consider all the facts, and speaks only from a limited perspective and a small sample of a few very bad games, and since people are hardly going to go around posting when they have three awesome positive games in a row when they do for negative, it colours the whole community's perception a lot darker than it really should be. \n\nIt's like the opposite of the whole rose coloured glasses thing. You see what you want to see, what you expect to see even if that means twisting or being blind to a certain part of the truth.","replies":[{"poster":"Main Line","date":"2017-05-29T11:50:38.815+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Seras Dragon,realm=OCE,application-id=T8eq2lFQ,discussion-id=fbLPmLf8,comment-id=000200000000000000000001000000000000,timestamp=2017-05-26T19:00:20.059+0000)\n>\n> My biggest gripe with the IFS in it&#x27;s current state is feedback. \n\nI'd agree with you there. The problem is that the automated system is too dumb to realise what is good and what is irrelevant feedback. \nFor example, I used to get notifications that my report had actually done something, but now I don't. I assume that this is because my report \"threshold\" has been lowered because the dumb system considered some of my reports to be false. I hardly report people, but when I do, its justified.\nPretty much if its not a slam dunk case, the report system fails to register the positive, e.g. an example would be a single game feeders/inters because they had so much rage they just had to hold the team hostage. They don't do it often enough for the system to pick them up, there's plenty of names I could give you with these characteristics. The Killtaiwanese guy is an extreme example that the system still takes a week or so to ban. Another example are those griefing players that make it look like they are just bad, but they grief after a disagreement and slowly work towards a loss... e.g. some junglers that mess up the first camp while they are getting a leash and smite while a leasher's auto-attack is in the air and that takes it. They then go and troll all game by pretending to jungle but in reality just fuck about.\n\nA human player tribunal that involves no-one in the affected game would just be so much better.","replies":[{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2017-05-30T09:42:10.624+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It has nothing to do with your report weight whether you get the notification or not. It's just only the last people in the last game to report someone will actually receive a notification, so if they are punished from a report from a previous game, or aren't punished till the next then you won't see a notification, despite being a recent report.\n\nThe notifications do still exist but the chance of actually seeing one is pretty slim :/\n\nAs I said, the intent feeding system is generally the one that struggles since there are subtle ways to feed that look very much like just being bad at the game.\n\nAs for a human tribunal, I won't deny it has it's merits, and some very strong ones, but it has to be done right. The old tribunal was being abused and wasn't very effective in the end. I'd rather stick with the IFS until Riot can work out the incentives and abuse cases with a tribunal and do it right.\n\nThere just wasn't enough oversight for tribunal, and as it was the amount of oversight that would have been needed would be pretty much the same manpower as would be necessary to just manually review every case anyway.\n\nI want tribunal to come back, and I want an opportunity to have more direct input in bettering the community, but the communities ideals (get rid of the toxics) don't always line up with Riot's (encourage reform) which creates a significant disconnect that has to be addressed in some way before they can properly get players involved again.

Spend a few dollars in the short term to avoid a lot of heartache in the long term. Of course by making the current system, Riot were really just trying to save money.\n\nThe current system rewards false positives. Like take the example of Gripex (streamer from NA today and Master/Challenger level player) today...banned for 14 days for going 1-1-1 with 2 people inting/trolling. Also the Nunu in his game is a wintrader.

There was a reward and the system was being abused for it. They need a reward that incentivises the right kind of player, maybe something tied to the honour system, rather than something that will appeal to all players who will do subpar or straight up bad work just to get the reward.\n\nAs for the current system, it does the opposite actually. Manual reviews work a little differently, since they don't tie into the IFS as much as they could, and the case you speak of sounds very much like a manual review, but the IFS itself punishes false reports. When you make a false report your report weight drops. If you report out of spite or for no reason enough your reports will be pretty much insignificant.\n\nIt's worth noting I have heard some things going around which might suggest that this is no longer the case, since the IFS has had plenty of time to learn most of the key behaviours to the point where a false report is irrelevant to it anyway so report weight doesn't have to be a thing anymore since it doesn't need that extra level of security. Either way though, that's hardly rewarding false reports.

Such a small games sample gives the player the impression that they are being jipped. And they are over that period of time when they played those games.\n\n> Hes right, **IF** your not a feeder then it is statistically more likely for their to be a feeder on the other team. \n\nThis old chestnut is completely irrelevant. It was made up by Gbay99 years ago as a means to try and be positive about the situation. But who is caring about statistics if the reality is that the OP gets a feeder, troll or afker in 3 consecutive games, sometimes being the same players involved! Guys like killtaiwanese032 (the famous bot that trolls on every Riot server) that take Riot a week or more to sanction (because their automated systems cannot tell if troll, feeder, bot or human after a couple of games - system needs more time, perhaps with human intervantion anyways), while they come back with a new account and do the same thing to others. Or how about the Gagong Teemo guy that distributed his Xerath hack to players on different servers, who destroyed some players games for a while before they got banned. All kinds of shit can happen and it's not what happens to you, but how you deal with it. If Riot don't take care of trollers, afkers or feeders in a quick and efficient fashion, then you have to find better ways to deal with it. For example, TheRainMan doesn't fuck around, he just ends the game quicker by inting. That's his strategy. If his jungler is trolling and ints, and its a 3-2 surrender vote where 2 players are trolling by voting no, he figures that its not worth messing around for 20 mins longer in a losing game (note this is diamond 2+ elo here, where players know how to use advantages and not throw). TheRainMan takes into account what the possibilities will be after his actions.\n\nI stand by what I said before \"It's better to educate the players how to react when you have feeders throughout the entire day.\" Because statistics ain't gonna help the person that's just been jipped. They doesn't feel good when the next day the enemy team has a troller, afker or feeder. Cheesy wins don't make them feel good either. What they want is fairness and good competition and punishments for trolls. At the present time there is no real punishment. Have you seen the player \"sunshower\" ? That's some bronze 5 player there, or is it?\n\nSandbagging elo, for example, is extremely hard for an automated system to judge. This is more prevalent in 2 player elo games, but the same principle can apply to win trading at higher elos because the pool size for those elos is limited on a given day (especially on small population servers). A win trader that sophisiticatedly loses games by trolling is not detected and goes unpunished. Think of the player that members of the Dire Wolves want punished but isn't. (If you don't know who, then nevermind, no naming and shaming, blah blah).\n\nThere's different sorts of trolls out there, and only a person with some IQ can detect them.\n\n> Since theirs a 3% of a feeder ending up any any of those spots theirs a 12% chance overall of you getting a feeder (3x4). Where as they have a 15% chance of getting a feeder (3x5). \n> \n> So yes there is a better chance of them getting a feeder than you.\n> \n\nWhat you're saying is that the odds for a infinitely large sample of your games are 3% in your favour. Which is diddly squat, negligible, not worth mentioning. Instead of using statistics to explain it, we can just say that\n\n1. Automated systems for troll prevention are not really working, and\n2. Players have to expect some imbalances and learn how to deal with this\n\nWhen the OP is saying things like \"They have cost me so many games where we going great because they didn't get a role they want, they lost early on or they started with the intention of losing.\" it means they just have to adjust how they approach those games. Maybe they try to calm the team, to be the mediator. Maybe they just mute all and carry on with their own improvement regime. Maybe they stop playing for the day and come back with a fresh mind the next day.","replies":[]},{"poster":"YellowBrickRoad","date":"2017-05-26T11:13:07.140+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"just as a correction its not 15%\n\nits 5 separate instances of 3% chance.\n\nThink of it as a coin toss, each individual player on the enemy team has a 3% chance of landing heads, and a 97% chance of landing tails, they all flip at once and if any of them have landed heads they are a feeder.\n\nThe total result is never 15% as the individual chances were never added together.\n\nLike if i kill something in a game that has a 1% chance to drop an item 100 times that is not a 100% chance to drop, same thing here.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Exarch Leona","date":"2017-05-26T06:58:44.953+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"We'll use his argument and your math (since you seem to have a way with numbers, this is a compliment). \nI just had 3 int feeders, they had 0.

Like i said above this assumes that only 3% of the population are INT feeders and will only give you the percentages for getting 3 INT feeders in a row. It would be much more likely to get someone having a bad game and feeding. Without the stats on how likely that is I can't take it into account. \n\nIt's also worthy noting with how the queue size change , while the number of feeders in the LOL population wouldn't change much; the percentage of INT feeders on line would rise and fall. For example if you were playing late at night because of the small number of people in queue the percentage of INT feeders could rise (or drop) dramatically. To something like 10% which of course would make encountering them much more likely.\n\nAlso I just noticed I made a mistake above, will fix it now.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Celestense","date":"2018-01-03T20:18:26.259+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I have been asking that myself since season 2 and the only 2 possible answers I can come up with are:\n\nEither Riot are trolls as well, or they are just insanely dumb.","replies":[{"poster":"Essembie","date":"2018-01-04T23:46:05.421+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Celestense,realm=EUW,application-id=T8eq2lFQ,discussion-id=fbLPmLf8,comment-id=0005,timestamp=2018-01-03T20:18:26.259+0000)\n>\n> I have been asking that myself since season 2 and the only 2 possible answers I can come up with are:\n> \n> Either Riot are trolls as well, or they are just insanely dumb.\n\nI have a strong feeling that since getting handed over to tencent, profit is a much higher priority for LoL (as opposed to player experience).

Until this changes, the situation remains the same. You can't do anything about it, so quit the whining, and play to improve at the game while dealing with it.\n\nGo into every game expecting that your team are monkeys. Don't tell them anything. Only use anonymous pings. Watch what they do. For Example if you think Baron is a free take, and you ping that and they don't go there, don't go there also unless you wanna die. And if you die, don't blame your team, they are monkeys and you went without them so you are monkey also.\n\nWork on your own gameplay. Eventually after grinding, you will rise out of the depths of the bad players. That is, if you are improving to a level that is better than they are.\n\n[Watch this.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R8BtklaSWl0)","replies":[]}]}
