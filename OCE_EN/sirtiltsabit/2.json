The mechanics are fun, the champions are fun to play and the items makes things different.\r\n\r\nHowever, it is also a terrible game in terms of community. I would rank just more toxic than Call of Duty.\r\n\r\nAs of today, every game I have played has had someone AFK, intentionally feed or intentionally throw because they lost their game. \r\n\r\nNow I know a lot of you will try to justify this trolling because in reality, if Riot knew that they had a real trolling issue, many of you will face the ban hammer so to speak so I will explain what they do. \r\n\r\n- AFK for multiple extended periods of time\r\n- Mouth of to everyone because they accept it is their fault\r\n- Repeatedly turret dive for the soul purpose of feeding\r\n- Running around in base trying to beat the leavebusters\r\n\r\nAnd before you say anything, no I haven&#039;t said anything back. My attitude has been &quot;well if I keep trying to be good, hopefully karma will reward me&quot;. It hasn&#039;t and the trolls keep on coming.\r\n\r\nSo what I am wondering is, is there a list you are put on randomly and temporarily in the match making system in order to help dilate the toxicity of the game?","replies":[{"poster":"Best Evelynn OCE","date":"2017-11-16T10:16:07.450+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I had stupid trolls ruin my placements, dropping me from a Gold V MMR to a Silver II one...
