I have been put into the low priority que twice before hand but those were for legit reasons. Im a good summoner I dont bring negativity to the game I have a teamwork ribbon and so on. Last game my p.c while I was in the middle of a game just reset itself. And therefore I was put in a low priority que for 5 games. I canot play as often as others because of my occupation. Therefore leaving me the weekend to fit in all the other things that involve my life. I love this game I spend alot of money on this game amd it sucks that I have to wait 20 mons before each game. So in total 100 mis of playing I could do. Can you please respond to me as you need to fix whats going on.","replies":[{"poster":"HORSE OF FORCE","date":"2014-12-27T01:56:51.795+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"This is not complete \"bs\". Leavebuster has been designed and redesigned the way it is (that is harsh) to prevent regular leavers from abusing the system somehow.\n\n> I have been put into the low priority que twice before hand but those were for legit reasons.\n\n\"Legit reasons,\"; so you have purposefully left games in the past? Why do you expect an exception to be made for you, of all people, then?\n\n> I love this game I spend alot of money on this game\n\nThat means nothing, don't use this as an argument.\n\n\nThey can't just make an exception to your computer randomly turning off. If they did, then other people would start rage-quitting by pressing the power button and get out of punishment.\n\nWhat you can do before entering a game is to check and make sure that there's nothing that will force your computer to shut-down without your consent. There's only a few system updates which force (usually Support Packages, and those are extremely rare) you to shut-down, but they give you many hours to do what you need to do before hand. When you've done that, make sure that you've eliminated all possible hardware issues that is causing your computer to shut-down prematurely (you may want to invest in an unstoppable power supply).\n\nIt's very unfortunate that you can only play a few days a week, which should probably strengthen the point of taking a bit of time out of your way to make sure your computer is perfectly functional.\n\nBest of luck.","replies":[]}]}
