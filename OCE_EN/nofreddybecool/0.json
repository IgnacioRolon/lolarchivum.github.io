Thye replied to me once saying that it averages at about 30mb. However, I checked my kilobits per second usage when in a game and it worked out that one game uses 216mb. This is alot more than 30mb. I've heard that there is a file called Pando Media Booster (pmb.exe) that sits in the background while playing lol and it uses alot of internet but i have checked everyway i can think of and i believe i do not have it instaled so i am still confused asf as to why my internet usage is over 195mb more than it should be. Somebody please shed some light on this for me please.","replies":[{"poster":"Cyber Phunk","date":"2015-04-03T05:58:49.594+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I've just been through the process of measuring my data usage while playing LoL recording Total Byte transfer (up & down) rates per second. My average Bytes/sec is 10842.767. That average is heavily influenced by the initial load and so is way too high (which makes it good for creating an over estimate). Unfortunately my performance monitor does not give me a Median.\n\nBy Multiplying this average by the duration of the game (36.35) I get a bit under 25MB of data transfer for that game. Again this is an over estimate.\n\nThis figure seems to confirm the figure given to you previously. 30MB sounds like a good (over estimated) average to work from.\n\nBy the way, if you're interested, working from my 25MB per game that means I can get 40 games per Gigabyte. If we assume 30MB per game then we get 33 games per Gigabyte. Not flippin bad.","replies":[]},{"poster":"HORSE OF FORCE","date":"2014-12-21T00:53:59.634+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Well, are you sure that League is the only thing open at the moment? A lot of the more recent programs created just LOVE to update themselves in the background without your knowledge, soaking up a very large amount of data. If you're on Windows, then you can go into your Task Manager to see your current Network usage. Try seeing if any of it is being used when League is closed.\n\nIf not that, then the way you connect could be messed up, as in, to transfer 1mb of data your computer has to go through some loopholes and whatnot and it ends up using 4mb.\n\nI highly doubtful League itself is using that much data. If it did, then games would be very laggy, as sending a lot of data takes a lot of time! That's also why League is installed locally instead of online, so that even less data needs to be transferred.\n\nHope that helps.","replies":[]}]}
