Cho'gath's ult does not scale off missing HP but it is an execute\n\nAn move is generally considered an execute when it is at its most useful when it kills the target, for example:\nJinx's R scales off missing HP so it is at its most useful at the end of a fight when someone is low HP so it will do the max possible damage and kill them.\nAnother example is: \nDarius's ult, it doesn't scale off the targets missing HP but it is at its most useful at the end of a fight when he is more likely to have max stacks of his passive and if he does kill the target he gets to use his ult again thus being at its most useful by killing an enemy.\nAnother example is:\nCaitlin's ult, this move just does straight damage, however it is at its most useful after a fight to pick off a fleeing enemy, it is virtually useless during a fight because a Caitlin should do more damage with her AA's during the channel time of her ult than the ult itself does. Plus the ult can be interrupted by cc on her.\n\nexamples of non execute ults are:\nVayne's ult, it is meant to be used at the start of a fight because that is when it is at its most useful so it's a duelling ult not an execute ult.\n\nAzirs ult can be used at any time during the fight and the cc component is more valued than the damage mostly, even though it can be used to deliver the final blow it is not at its most effective when you do that.","replies":[{"poster":"Klavinmour","date":"2015-01-04T08:40:24.166+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"YOu know what I can't understand?\n\nYou're not complaining about Garen.
