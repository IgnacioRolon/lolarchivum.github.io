All you have to do is notify Riot that these people are breaking the rules and that's it. No argument required. But now, since you didn't report them, they will continue to sell accounts. Shame OP, shame.\n\n> Could you please advise me how create the e-mail alert?

Why should I feel ashamed for something others do?\nThis is Riot's forum and if they really care, a moderator acting for Riot can still look through yesterday chatting.\nYou should point your blame to somewhere else.\nBTW, rude and bully members on LoL have already pushed me out of the game, playing DOTA 2 right now.\nGood luck Riot with rude and uneducated kids.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}
