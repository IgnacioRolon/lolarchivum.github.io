However this means thornmail would kill him instantly. Thats fair.\r\n\r\n\r\nQ: Ten Million Punches   Cooldown: Wat da faq? this guy needs no cooldowns.\r\nCost: Does THE FLASH need mana to go fast???????\r\nBarry punches something ten million times in less than an instant.\r\nKilling it instantly.\r\nDamage: 101% Enemy MAX HP as True Damage.\r\n\r\nW: Strip.\r\nBarry strips the enemy of their equipment in an instant and instantly sells them for money and gives it to his own teammates.\r\nDealing no damage but stealing all the enemies items and sells them and distributes the gold evenly to his teammates.\r\nThe enemy is left with:\r\nNO items and NO Gold, All bonus Stats are removedd for the rest of the game.\r\n\r\n\r\nE: Time Travel\r\nBarry runs so fast he goes back in time, everything on the rift resets except for him. Everyone else is reversed to level 1 and starting gold, but Barry is still normal with his gold and exp. He can also travel forwards in time into a future that he has won this game, granting him instant victory.\r\n\r\nPassive: Time travel automatically activates if the enemy attacks his Nexus, or when a surrender vote is put up. Time travel will bring him to the past and force everyone to restart.\r\nIf 1 player disconnects, Barry will run into the future, winning the game.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nR: Time Remenant   0/0/-1 seconds cooldown  Cost: X^2 - Y^X = Z^(y-x) \r\nBarry summons certain amounts of himself onto the battlefield to destroy everything that stands in his way. Each copy has 100% of his stats.\r\nUp to INFINITE/INFINITE + 1/  INIFINITE + X amounts of himself.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWHy he is fair. \r\nBarry Allen is 100% source material, the truth is fair isnt it?\r\n\r\n\r\nP.S. This is a joke and should not be taken seriously.( like ur ranked games, yeah im talking to you the Bronze Negative 1 million player.
