It's crazy cc maybe remove the stuns off the passive or make it that you can't activate it on the same target for like 10 seconds ?\n\nThe passive itself is almost an ability, remove the stun off the E and is the Ult like a taunt that makes the target only attack you?  All in all its a pretty cool idea","replies":[{"poster":"Suki no Sukiru","date":"2015-10-07T04:39:39.319+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"its more like an arena with only you and the selected enemy inside a certain part of the rift (in an alternate reality which only you and the target is there) to go full on also the passive takes a long time to activate. Reading the Spacial merge gaining point will point out what i mean. And yes i turned the e stun to a very small amount.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"SilentXKiller","date":"2015-10-05T04:51:06.468+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Name Suggestions: Solar, Lunar, Cosmos, Milky???,","replies":[{"poster":"Suki no Sukiru","date":"2015-10-05T07:27:03.967+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Choros","replies":[]}]}]}
