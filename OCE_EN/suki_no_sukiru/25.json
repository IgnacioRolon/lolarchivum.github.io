This stacks.\nEach stack causes the enemy to take Lvl x 3 TD + 1% MAX HP over 2 seconds as TRUE DAMAGE.\n\nIN ADDITION: Enemies below 20% MAX HP will have grievous wounds added.\n\n\nEXAMPLE: After a short trade in lane, the enemy {{champion:92}} used her Q,a,Q,a,Q,a combo on shwirlix, hitting him six times with melee attacks.\nShwirlix then hit her again with an auto followed by Wicked Jaws, pulling her back to Shwirlix and stunning her since she already has 6 stacks of Venom on her, before striking again with another Auto attack closing the trade.\nTHe enemy riven has gained 6 (from her abilities) + 2( Wicked Jaws) + 2 (Shwirlix Auto Attack) = 10 stacks of Cursed Venom.\nThen she will proceed to take Lvl x 30 + 10 of her MAX HP over 20 seconds.\nThe damage would have begun the moment she initiated with her first Q.\n\n\nQ: Wicked Jaws   65MP 14/12.5/11/9.5/8 seconds.\nShwirlix rises his upper body to bite down at the enemy after a short duration.\nThis has a basic melee simple bite, but it can also be used within 300 units, then Shwirlix will extend his body and pull the enemy to him.\n\nThis deals 30/60/100/150/210 + 60%AD Physical Damage.\n\nApplies 2 stacks of Cursed Venom.\n\nIf the enemy has more than 5 stacks already, they will also be stunned for 1 second.\n\n\nW: Burrow Haven/ Out Burst. 30 MP      20 second cooldown.\nUpon activation, Shwirlix digs a burrow into the nearby wall over 4 seconds. Creating a haven that is invisible to enemies.\nShwirlix can have unlimited havens in the map, however if a Haven is not used within 90 seconds of creation or last use, it will shrivel away.\n\nShwirlix can enter a haven when he is not in combat with Enemy Champions, or at least 4 seconds out of combat with champions.\nIn the haven Shwirlix rapidy regenerates health and Mana and is CAMOUFLAGED.\nWhen a nearby enemy comes within the outburst range, he becomes visible to them\n\nEvery second in the Haven Shwirlix heals for\n10/20/30/40/50 + 5/10/15/20/25% AD Health.\nand\n4/8/12/16/20 + 10%AP Mana\n\nIf an enemy sees Shwirlix burrow into a haven, that haven becomes visible and enemies can attack to destroy it.\n\n\n\nOutburst: Schwarlix bursts out of its burrow and onto a nearby enemy within 350 range.\nLatching onto it and constantly basic attacking the target for up to 3 seconds or until he commands himself with a movement.\nActivating Wicked Jaws will instantly bite the target and apply the stun regardless of their Venom Stacks.\n\nActivating Tail crush will cause him to carry his target for the roll.\n\nThis destroys the burrow.\n\n\nE: Tail Crush 60/75/90/105/120 MP 26/24/22/20/18 seconds\n\nShwirlix rolls a distance up to 700 units forward at 150% his current movement speed and slams his lower body down onto enemies up to 200 units in front upon reaching his desired location.\n\nThis deals 10% of SHWIRLIX&#039;S MAX HP and 35%AD + 30/60/90/120/150 Physical Damage.\n\nApplies 2 stacks of Venom.\n\nEnemies in his roll will be pushed with him to his final location and take bonus damage.\n\nRolled enemies gain an additional 2 stacks of Venom, total of 4.\n\nRolled enemeis are also stunned and take an additional 50% damage.\n\n\n\nR: Venom Hyperdrive Cost 1% MAX HP + 20/40/60 HP per second. Cost 10/25/40 Mana per second.  Toggle on and off.\nPassive: Power of Cursed Venom is increased.\nBase damage increased from Lvl x 3 to Lvl x 5/7/9 True Damage.\nMAX HP damage is also increased from Lvl x 1 to Lvl x 1.5/2/2.5% MAX HP TD.\n\nActive: Shwirlix puts his body into hyperdrive. Draining Health and Mana per second to release Venom to all units around him within 500 units.\nEvery second, Enemies gain 1 stack of Venom.\nShwirlix also gain additional movement speed while this is active\n~~Gains 10/20/30 + 10/20/30% Bonus movement speed.~~\n\nNo longer gains movement speed instead.\nNEW: Bonus resistences.\nShwirlix gains additional armor and Magic resist over the duration.\nEvery time a nearby champion gains a stack of Venom nearby, Shwirlix gains 2/3/4 Armor and 2/3/4 Magic Resist.\n\nI believe he needs resistances rather than movement speed so he will not be killed too quickly, since if he dies too early, he wont be able to lay poison on everyone.\n\n\n\n\n\nGameplay should be pretty straight forward, If laning, dig a burrow near your turret so that when low in lane you can hide in the burrow from ganks and restore health to better stay in lane. Using you can also attack unsuspected champions who come to attack your tower.\n\nIn a fight you can use your Q, Wicked Jaws to grab onto enemies who are escaping or simply bite them for the sake of damage and a bit of poke.\nSUstained fights greatly benefit Shwirlix as his passive becomes stronger the more the fight goes on.\n\nSchwirlix is especially powerful against melee champions since any melee champions melee attacks and abilities will give themselves stakcs.\n\nWhen a melee champion comes in for an engage, hit them until they try to back out, in which you can pull them back in with Wicked Jaws, causing them to be attacked and take even more stacks of Cursed Venom.\n\nSome good items on Shwirlix would be {{item:3748}} , {{item:3078}}  {{item:3022}} any boot, and {{item:3071}}  with {{item:3053}} .\nThis improves his tankiness and increases his damage output.","replies":[{"poster":"FranticFerret","date":"2017-07-15T14:04:43.188+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Dammmmn, this is so cool! I love his passive, Q, W, and R, although his E seems a bit out of place IMO. I like the idea of him being another member of Rek'sai's species, and in game it seems like his role would be a juggernaut that builds tanky and his main source of damage would be his passive. I think it'd be good to focus a lot on his passive, since everything revolves around that. it'd be cool though, a tanky juggernaut who puts venom on all around him when he ults, and that's where his damage comes from.\n\nI really like his Q, such a cool idea, like a super short pull. Just a bit of a \"nonono I'm not done with you yet\" sort of thing! :p Imagine a void tunneler just read up and chomp down on someone and drag them back, it's a funny sight! :p\n\nI reckon for his W it should be camoflauge, so he can't just sit there permanently. Like, if someone walks near him, they'll be able to attack his tunnel, so he can't just lie in wait forever. If someone finds him he has to act, because they'll see him, ya know? Either outburst or run away. :)\n\nCool ideas! I like them! :)","replies":[{"poster":"Suki no Sukiru","date":"2017-07-15T23:35:29.684+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yeah thats a good idea, in real life an actual centipede wwould be like camouflaged in the ground and try to attack or run once it gets found thank you for you opinion :))","replies":[{"poster":"FranticFerret","date":"2017-07-16T04:12:55.131+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"No problem!
