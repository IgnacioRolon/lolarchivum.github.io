The damage reduced is increased by 1% for every 3 points of Armor AND MR.\n(30 Armor 30 MR = 10%// 60Armor 30 Armor = 10%// 60 Armor 60MR = 20%.)\n\nThe morning star launches up to 650 units away.\nKnocks back 150 units.\nDeals from 70%AD + 30%AP + 35/60/85/110/135 Physical Damage to all enemies hit and knocked back.\n\n\nW: Pillar of the Depth 17/15/13/11/9 seconds.\nLaarx becomes rooted for a short duration (0.25s) while he smashes the ground beneath him and sending his morning star through a portal in the ground which appears below the select area. After a short duration all enemies struck from below is knocked up.\nCast range of 700.\nAoe of 175.\nDeals 70%AP + 30%AD + 4% Max HP + 40/85/130/175/220 magic damage.\n\n\nE: Dark Portal 18/16/14/12/10 seconds.  Range of 400, or up to 700 range if an enemy is marked.\nPassive: Enemies hit by basic attacks or abilities are marked with a ring of 150 units surrounding them that Lasts 4 seconds.\nActive: Laarx opens a dark portal, tunneling into the chosen location, if it is within the ring of an enemy marked by Dark Portal, its cooldown is reduced by 70%.\n\nA portal also appears at the targeted location if it is not within an enemy ring, which tells enemies where Laarx will be appearing from.\nThere is a total delay of 0.15s during when he activates and appears.\n\nIf he teleports into a ring, the ring/rings where he will appear in will darken, not enough to reduce vision but able to tell enemies an estimated location of where he will appear.\n\nUpon exiting the portal, Laarx heals for 10%AD + 10%AP + 150% BONUS Armor and MR over 3 seconds.\n\n\nR: Dimensional Haul  120/100/80 seconds.\nAfter a very short animation time (~0.2 seconds)\nLaarx chains up all enemy champions within 600 range for up to 10 seconds.\nEnemies chained are slowed by 10/15/20% and transfers 10% AP + 5%AD + 5/40/75 Health per second.\nDamage is dealt as Magic damage. \n\nWhile active, the morningstar chances to a claw like shape, instead of being knocked back 150 units, groups of enemies hit will be dragged towards Laarx instead.\n\nEnemies who walk in later are not affected.\n\nWhile active, Laarx heals for 10/20/30% of all damage dealt. (Excluding damage dealt by chains.)\nAfter 3.5 seconds, Laarx can reactivate to end the duration early, pulling all currently attached enemies 300 units closer to him.\nEnemies who get pulled on top or within 50 units of Laarx take damage equal to 40%AD + 40%AP + 40/150/260 physical damage and are stunned for 1 second.\n\nHis gameplay should rather easy to understand from how his abilities function.\n\nBut here is a short description anyways.\n\nPassive: The concept is simple enough, building Defenses makes Laarx much more tanky, while building damage also grants a little bit of defenses in return. There is no forced \"Tank\" or forced \"Damage\" play, much like some other champions, it is completely up to the player to go either full damage and a bit harder to kill, or full tank and recovering massive amounts of health.\nDifferent abilities function better depending on what spectrum he is building towards.\n\nQ: This ability seems quite simple but the right use can turn the tide of a fight. It is great for poking in lane, farming the jungle, or sustaining imminent burst damage.\nA well timed Q can cause Laarx to come out with tons of health from a trade, even if the strike misses.\n\nUsually this will be the ability players would want to max first for more damage and sustainability in trades.\nOr when building attack damage. \nAs a bonus for building tanky items, armor and magic resist increases the damage reduced by this ability and thus also increasing health recovered.\n\nAs a bonus for building AD, this ability has a decent AD scaling.\n\nW: A knockup with a short delay, with E learnt, can be used to set up a gank or a fight. Using dark portal to gap close near the enemy within the circle, then using Morning star of Death to counter any burst damage the enemy may try to set up, then knocking them to a location where your team can easily pick off. However knocking to the wrong side... wont be as nice..\n\nThis ability is the AoE magic damage nuke for Laarx, if Laarx builds AP, he is rewarded by good AoE cc and burst damage for landing this skillshot, and with a % max health damage it is guaranteed to hit quite hard on squishy and tanky foes alike.\n\nMax this ability first to set up better ganks, or when building ability power.\n\n\nE: Dark portal is what will make this Darkin teleport around the battlefield to unleash havoc around his enemies, while recovering a little bit of health which increases based on how tanky you are, or how much damage you've built, will certainly cause panick among your enemies.\n\nBeing able to continuously chase down your enemy while resurfacing with a little more health each time is certain to make you enemies panic.\nThis scales a small amount with the player's AD or AP, but building tanky is rewarded with even more recovered health scaling off BONUS Armor and Magic resist.\nThis would usually be the last ability to max, however when the enemy team has squishy highly mobile characters, max this ability first for reduced cooldowns and a much more thrilling chase!\n\nR: Activate and all enemy champions within a set distance becomes hooked and slowed while transferring health to Laarx. After a 3.5 second duration, Laarx can either set up a good aoe pull to set up a coordinated strike, or let it last through the fight out to restore more health and provide slows to affected enemies.\n\nCorrect usage is sure to award players who look out.\nSince the pull is instant, paying attention to what your team is up to will reward the player for doing so.\n\nThere are times where a player would have to choose between pulling all enemies a bit closer, or pulling one or two enemies directly on top of Laarx at the cost of a few enemies escaping in return for more burst damage and crowd control on lesser targets.\n\nAs an ultimate, max whenever possible, whether it be setting up a gank, E into the enemy, whether they have been hit by Pillar of the Depths or not, then unleash the chains onto them for an almost secured lockdown.\n Players building damage will find themselves dealing tons of damage per second with this ability, while players building tank will find that they are much more harder to be taken down.\n\nAny comments would be nice!","replies":[{"poster":"TheSlader42","date":"2018-08-05T23:29:26.400+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Not bad but I think Riot is trialling brand new concepts so if you included an ability that has never been explored before it would be a solid champ. A lot of similar abilities to current champ abilities. Laarx's Q is very similar to {{champion:39}} W, Laarx's W is similar to {{champion:31}} Q, Laarx's E is similar to {{champion:145}} Ult, and Laarx's ult is similar to {{champion:25}} ult mixed with hooking abilities. Also I would like for Riot to work on champions from an area that needs a lore update. Love these champion concepts and you definitely put a lot of thought into it. Good job","replies":[]},{"poster":"Quinncest","date":"2018-08-04T04:02:47.118+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"laarx sounds likes laxatives","replies":[{"poster":"Suki no Sukiru","date":"2018-08-04T05:39:42.449+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"hehehe but your name is \"Quinncest\" so i think we're even hehe xd","replies":[]},{"poster":"Quinncest","date":"2018-08-04T04:03:12.034+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"i like it but","replies":[]}]}]}
