The passive is sooper dooper boring, maybe have something tied to facing him as opposed to just dropping A/MR/MS. \n2. The Q err, yeah it's alright I guess. It's a long cooldown for an ability tied to being recast for extra effects.\n3. W is ok. Yeah. Ok. I guess. Yeah. Seems a bit slow for the effect. Galio charges to jump forward and justice punch. Vi charges to launch forward and punch. Nunu charges to PONCH everything. Camille can charge her Q to do a sick flip. \n4. Attack speed on hit? Ok then. \n5. The ult is umm, yeah I guess interesting a bit extended but yeah. \nIf you want to build a kit around terrifying the enemy, I'd suggest coming up with a different sort of interesting mechanic to go along with it. Warwick is scary as heck because when you're low health, music plays and you know he knows you're low. The fear mechanic on it's own isn't all that interesting or fun.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Critscendo","date":"2017-05-03T11:08:31.529+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Interesting. Feels a lot like fiddle sticks but like bunch more fear. It is important that you think what it is like to be against this champion and fear is a pretty painful form of cc.","replies":[]}]}
