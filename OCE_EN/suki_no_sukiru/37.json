At the time of writing this i am currently residing in Platinum 1, and am a Master Yi/Jungle Main.\r\nWith more than 1 million mastery points and probably over 1000 games on him by now.\r\nI started playing in Season 5 and was Bronze. Soon i started playing {{champion:11}} and climbed to gold 5 in season 6.\r\nIn season 7 i only managed to get to gold 3. But now in season 8 i have almost reached Diamond.\r\n\r\nI Truly believe, Any Master Yi player can get to Gold.\r\n\r\nAre you tired of - Dealing no damage to tanks?\r\nAre you tired of - Being 1 shot by assassins in late game?\r\nAre you tired of - Enemy teams disrespecting you?\r\nAre you tired of - Split pushing and the enemy team 3 v 1 stomps over you?\r\nAre you tired of - Your sh*t team not focusing on objective?\r\nAre you tired of - Dying too soon in a teamfight and not dealing damage?\r\nAre you tired of - Not getting Pentakills?\r\nAre you tired of - BEING STUCK IN BRONZE, SILVER, OR GOLD???? (Maybe even plat...?)\r\n\r\n\r\nThis guide is for those who are willing to take time to pick up Master Yi, The Wuju Bladesman... (In my style)\r\n(Will be even more relatable to current Yi Players.)\r\n\r\nI will be talking about several things, in this order:\r\n1. Who is Master Yi?\r\n2. Items and Runes for the Wuju Bladesman.\r\n3. The Lanes.\r\n4. The Jungle and objectives.\r\n5. Ganks.\r\n6. To Carry a Lead.\r\n7. Tower Diving.\r\n8. Split pushing.\r\n9. Team Fighting.\r\n10. Techniques for Burst Damage.\r\n11. Some of Master Yi&#039;s Counter picks, and how to counter them.\r\n\r\n**Who is Master Yi?**\r\nMaster Yi is in my opinion without a doubt one of the most influential and powerful characters in the game.\r\nHis presence cannot be ignored in a teamfight and as long as you know what you are doing, you will sweep the battlefield and change the flow of the game.\r\nWith outplay potential to 1v1 almost any champion, We have Master Yi, The Wuju Bladesman.\r\n\r\n\r\nStrategic Rundown of his abilities.\r\n\r\n\r\nPassive: Double Strike.\r\n- Every 4th basic attack strikes twice, second one dealing 50% less damage. Still applies on-hit affects.\r\nTips: Double strike reduces Alpha strikes cooldown by 2 seconds, Saving the double strike for after using Q is a very effective way to reduce Alpha Cooldown.\r\nDouble strike cannot be cancelled once it is begun, use this to your advantage to surprise your enemies with damage. The moment you begin double strike instantly Q, your second hit will go off while you are Untargetable.\r\nDouble strike automatically strikes the nearest lowest health target when the first strike kills its original target. Use this to your advantage when clearing camps.\r\nDouble strike applies On-Hit effects 2 times, use this to your advantage and activate Wuju Style (E) before double strike goes off to deal most optimal damage.\r\n\r\nQ - Alpha Strike.\r\nAfter a strange delay time... (I WAS IN ALPHA) Master Yi teleports to strike up to 4 closest enemies.\r\nThis can crit, though my guide ignores this, i do not encourage play of Crit Yi in most cases.\r\nBasic attacks reduce the cooldown of Alpha Strike by 1 second.\r\n\r\nTips\r\n-Dodging enemy abilities. When you are going to be hit by some kind of crowd control, use alpha strike to dodge it.\r\n-Alpha strike almost always lands you on top of your enemy, however sometimes when you Alpha Strike a moving target and you right click towards one side, you can appear on the side a bit more, use this to dodge enemy abilities cast right on top of your ally.\r\n-Use alpha strike close to a low health enemy champion you cannot reach, you may bounce to them and deal damage, use this to poke or finish off enemies.\r\n\r\n\r\nW - Meditate.\r\nChannels to reduce incoming damage and heal. While gaining stacks of Double Strike and pausing the remaining duration of Wuju Style and Highlander.\r\n\r\nTips\r\n- When jungling, sometimes meditate before attacking the camp so you begin with Double Strike ready, dealing more damage to clear faster.\r\n- Meditate resets your AA Timer, use this to quickly dish out damage on an unsuspecting enemy.\r\n- The reset also blocks damage, correct use of this can protect you from immediate burst and still allow you to continue dishing out damage as if nothing happened.\r\n- Know when to use Meditate to reset or to continue meditating to heal.\r\n- Use Meditate to tank tower shot when you come out of a tower dive.\r\n- When allies dive enemies and you have tower aggro, Try to meditate under tower to allow your  allies to continue fighting without taking shots.\r\n- It is a common mistake to meditate when you are about to die in a 1v1, this is very bad behaviour unless your allies may arrive to finish off your attacker. Dont meditate when you&#039;re going to die anyways and no one can come clean up, the quicker you die the quicker you can go back to farming.\r\n\r\n\r\nE - Wuju Style.\r\nActivate for 5 seconds all attacks deal bonus True Damage.\r\n\r\nTips\r\n- If you are going attack speed, Consider maxing Wuju style after ranking Alpha strike to rank 3/4. It will deal more damage than Alpha strike in about 4 hits. If you build attack speed it will deal faster, if you Build damage rank this up to 5 last. But get it to rank 2 at level 7.\r\n-It is technically an on-hit affect therefor it does not affect towers, do not waste Wuju style on towers.\r\n-When hitting tanks, try not to use this too early as once it wears off you&#039;re damage will be heavily reduced. A good rule of Thumb to activate Wuju style is if you can deal more than 25% of the enemy hp with the first 3 attacks, Activate E for the double strike. Or if you have stacked Conqueror/ Activated Press the Attack/ Activated Lethal Tempo/ Fully stacked Guinsoos Rageblade.{{item:3124}} \r\n\r\nR - Highlander\r\nPassive: Kills refund a large portion of cooldown of other abilities.\r\nActive: Gains Movement and attack speed for a short duration. Immune to slows while active, Kills/Assists extend duration.\r\n\r\nTips\r\n- Not all fights must start with highlander, sometimes it is better to activate highlander when a takedown is about to be done. Because Highlander is added bonus duration not extended remaining duration, the sooner you get your bonus time the longer you can be in highlander for.\r\n- Highlander is great at escaping, if situation seems dire do not be afraid to press R and run off.\r\n- Highlander&#039;s passive gives resets as long as you get an assists, you can just hit an enemy then go for back line, once your in the fight against their backline and your team lands the takedown on a target you&#039;ve hit you will get your extended duration and resets.\r\n- When you are no longer in combat and are waiting for minions to push to tower, meditate to recover health and pause the duration of Highlander so you can push towers faster. Or if there are still enemies alive you may need to fight, having its affects last can be the difference between scoring another takedown or losing the game.\r\n- Do not hesitate to use Highlander to clear objectives if you fear time is on the line.\r\n- Highlander&#039;s buffs stack in a way that the more attack speed you&#039;ve already built the stronger its buffs are, building attack speed is really good on Yi...\r\n- Remember to chase as well as weaving in Auto Attacks. once you see your auto timer, you can click to move your character forward, this means you keep the chase up as well as hitting them. Doing so lands you more hits and help secures the kill.\r\n\r\n\r\n**Items and Runes for the Wuju Bladesman**\r\nThe No.1 Rule of playing Yi in my style of gaming is to NEVER GO SQUISHY.\r\n\r\nRunes are as follows:\r\nFor Primary Tree we always choose PRECISION, without exception.\r\nFor Keystone it is between CONQUEROR and LETHAL TEMPO.\r\nRule of Thumb: Only get Lethal Tempo if enemies do not have tanks.\r\nRule of... next finger?: Do not get Conqueror if the enemy comp is VERY EARLY GAME BASED.\r\n\r\nOther runes are without option, You will always be taking TRIUMPH and LAST STAND.\r\nFor the LEGEND runes, your choices are between ALACRITY and TENACITY.\r\nRules are: \r\nIf 4 or more of them have cc of any kind = Legend Tenacity.\r\nThey only have 1 cc that cannot be dodged, such as {{champion:90}} . Take Legend Alacrity and itemise into {{item:3140}} {{item:3139}}.\r\nif \r\n\r\nLegend Bloodline can be good, but i have never used it, try at your own risk.\r\n\r\n\r\nSecondary tree the choices are between Domination, Sorcery, and Resolve.\r\n\r\nDomination: You will be taking Ghost Poro and Ravenous hunter.\r\nTake domination if you are building lots of On-Hit damage. Ravenous hunter heals for non-AA damage dealt of any kind. \r\nPaired with a Spirit Visage{{item:3065}} you will be healing tons.\r\n\r\nSorcery: You will take Celerity and Gathering Storm.\r\nTake Sorcery for most of your builds, the damage offered by a combination of Gathering Storm and Celerity can be worth a BF Sword {{item:1038}} by around 30 minutes.\r\nThis build allows you to tank up while still gaining damage. It is my most common pick.\r\n\r\nResolve: You will take Conditioning and Unflinching\r\nYou should only take Resolve when you are taking Legend Tenacity, which you will be taking because the enemy has LOTS of cc.\r\nWith this tree you can build much tank items and gain Tenacity after using Summoner Spells.\r\nOtherwise this tree is not that good.\r\n\r\n\r\nNow, time for items.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn a typical game, your main 3 items will **ALWAYS be** these.\r\n{{item:1419}} {{item:3124}}  and boots being either {{item:3047}} {{item:3111}} .\r\nWhen choosing between boots you look at enemy comp, if they have more than 1 aa Champion choose tabis.\r\nIn champ select screen, if you decide you will take Tabis, take Legend Tenacity in runes.\r\nIf you choose Mercury Treads{{item:3111}} , you can also get Legend Tenacity.\r\nIf you chose Tabis{{item:3047}}  and Legend Alacrity, consider getting QSS{{item:3140}} {{item:3139}}  if they have much cc, and Elixir of Iron{{item:2138}} \r\n\r\nWith these 3 items as your basics you will be able to out-duel almost anyone with Guinsoos full stacked.\r\n\r\nThe remaining Items will be 3 made up of any of the following items.\r\n{{item:3143}} {{item:3075}} {{item:3071}} {{item:3748}} {{item:3053}} {{item:3153}} {{item:3065}} {{item:3139}} {{item:3091}} {{item:3026}} {{item:3156}} {{item:3812}} {{item:3742}} \r\n\r\nI&#039;ll give a rundown of when to get any of these items. Every game you will be getting these items without exception, anything out of these items are considered by my standards, Feeding.\r\n\r\n{{item:3143}} Randuins Omen.\r\nEven if it is just 1 Crit Champion, get Randuins. The slow counters what comes with most Crit champions, Movement Speed. The health and armour helps survive and tower dive. Increase Risk Taking potential.\r\n\r\n{{item:3075}} Thornmail.\r\nThis item is situational, in my opinion it is below that of Randuins Omen.\r\nGet this item if the enemies have heavy NON-CRIT based comp.\r\nSuch as assassins or rapid attacking champions such as {{champion:29}} {{champion:96}} \r\nIt gives more Armour but less health, it is also effective against champions like {{champion:114}} {{champion:119}}  who heals from AA.\r\n\r\n{{item:3071}} Black Cleaver\r\nThis item is a must get when the enemy team has More than 1 very tanky targets. Especially if they have counter picked with {{champion:33}} \r\nThe Health gives survivability, Cooldown reduction is very good on Yi though it should not be bought purposely.\r\n \r\n{{item:3748}} Titanic Hydra\r\nThis item can be considered getting when you are building very tanky.\r\nBecause the AoE applies Black Cleaver {{item:3071}} passive, it also works very well with cleaver.\r\nThe active can help you reset AA timer, allowing quickly bursting and stacking Guinsoos Rageblade.\r\n\r\n{{item:3053}} Steraks Gage\r\nThis item you should get when building very tanky and enemies have heavy burst.\r\n... Nothing else to say, Moving on.\r\n\r\n{{item:3153}} Blade of the Ruined King\r\nThis item is very good on Yi, though i do not get it very often.\r\nThis item helps you shred tanks, chase down kills, gives sustain in the form of Life Steal... the worst type of sustain in small amounts.\r\nGet this item if the enemy doesn&#039;t have much cc and has 2+ tanks.\r\n\r\n{{item:3065}} Spirit Visage\r\nOne of my Favourite items to build on Yi.\r\nBuild when enemies have a mage. Any mage.\r\nThe Health gives sustain, Magic Resistance gives defences, CDR is a very underrated stat on Yi.\r\nThe Passive makes your heals so much stronger. Including Meditate and Triumph Rune healing about 15% Missing HP with Visage.\r\n\r\n\r\n{{item:3139}} Mercurial Scimitar (Did i spell it wrong?)\r\nGet this item when the enemies have hard hitting suppression and other cc. Champions such as {{champion:117}} {{champion:90}} {{champion:19}} {{champion:72}} {{champion:142}} {{champion:89}} \r\nThe Lifesteal and Damage and Magic resist stats are not the most desirable, though they are a nice addition.\r\nThe Active is what we want it for.\r\n\r\n{{item:3091}} Wits End.\r\nThis item is situational, it is good when the enemy has lots of Magic damage. The Attack speed and on-hit damage scale well with Guinsoos.\r\n\r\n{{item:3026}} Guardian Angel\r\nSituational, if the enemy team is focusing you every time, this item gives you a second chance once you revive, although if you have a very squishy team that dies quickly this item is a waste because once you die you team will fall apart and by the time you revive chances are the rest of your allies have died too or retreated.\r\nBut if you are very ahead, use this item to aggressively snowball.\r\n\r\n{{item:3156}} Maw of .... (Cant spell it)\r\nSituational Item, should only be got if the enemy team is very magic heavy, along with this item you should have at least 2 more Magic Resist Items.\r\nSuch as Visage, Wits end, Mercurial, Mercury Treads .etc\r\nThis item offers a very good passive shielding for magic damage. \r\nThe stats are otherwise not that good.\r\n\r\n{{item:3812}} Death Dance\r\nVery situational Item, if the enemy team is very heavy on burst and you have Spirit Visage, this item will allow you to survive for a very long time.\r\nFunnily enough it works well with Guardian Angel and Blade of the Ruined King, Guinsoos and Bloodrazor as it allows you to heal off its on-hit damages. Especially with Spirit Visage you&#039;ll be healing quite a bit.\r\nBut this is still situational as it messes with Alpha Strike Judgement, though it lets you heal sometimes you may have to Q Earlier as the bleed damage can kill you during Alpha Strike.\r\n\r\n{{item:3742}}  Deadmans Plate\r\nI only ever get this item when i go for a certain build.\r\nThis item gives Armor, health and Movement speed. If you sell Tabi&#039;s for this item, it can work out.\r\n\r\nHere are some common builds i take and my rating of Damage output and Physical and Magical Resistance out of all possible.\r\nBoots are situational between Tabi and Mercury Treads.\r\n\r\n{{item:1419}} {{item:3124}} {{item:3065}} {{item:3143}} {{item:3139}}\r\n6/10 Damage\r\n7/10 for Physical and Magic Resistance.\r\nA good build against a team of mixed damage and present CC.\r\nYou&#039;ll deal a lot of damage, be hard to stop with QSS present and be very tanky thanks to Randuins and Visage.\r\nVisage works with QSS to increase you healing.\r\nYou can add in Blade of the Ruined king instead of QSS, that would trade a point of Magical Resistance for a point into Damage Output.\r\n\r\n{{item:1419}} {{item:3124}} {{item:3075}} {{item:3143}} {{item:3091}}\r\n7/10 Damage\r\n9/10 for Physical Resistances\r\n6/10 for Magical Resistance\r\n\r\nEnemy team is Heavily AD but still has Magic Damage? This build  is the build to go.\r\nIt makes you incredibly tanky and almost completely tanks their Physical Damage while still letting you deal lots of Damage with Wits End Attack Speed and Magic Damage on-hit.\r\n\r\n{{item:1419}} {{item:3124}} {{item:3065}} {{item:3139}} {{item:3156}}\r\n8/10 Damage\r\n3/10 Physical Resistance\r\n9/10 Magical Resistance\r\n\r\nIf the enemy team is heavily magic oriented, this is a good build to go.\r\nIt is possible to switch out QSS for a Wits End if the enemy team has no hard hitting cc, or they have cc you can confidently dodge with Alpha Strike.\r\nThough lacking on the physical defences, the player may choose to buy tabis if needed.\r\n\r\n{{item:1419}} {{item:3124}} {{item:3065}} {{item:3143}} (Or Thornmail if the enemy has no crit champions) {{item:3053}} {{item:3742}} \r\n7/10 Damage\r\n7/10 Physical Resistance\r\n7/10 Magical Resistance\r\n+ To Survivability\r\nThis build is the Hyperjuggernaut. This is the kind of build you would take to 1v9.\r\nYou have high survivability, Steraks gives you shielding to burst damage, Your resistances give you... resistances.\r\nMost of all you still deal a ton of damage. This is a front liner build, where the enemy will focus you, but you will deal damage back and make it insanely time draining to kill you by dodging abilities correctly with Alpha strike, and tanking correctly with Meditate if needed.\r\n\r\n\r\nA special note on Master Work Ornn Items.\r\nIf you have thoughts on what items you should get when your team has an Ornn?\r\n\r\nThese are the only items you should think about getting, and situational items only, never buy them for the sake of buying them.\r\nThese are my favourite Masterwork Ornn Items, on Master Yi{{champion:11}} \r\n{{item:3373}} Forgefire Cape.\r\nThis item is really good, It gives tons of Armor and health.\r\nHowever this is situational still, if the enemy team has no crit and you are going to build a thornmail, you can consider changing it into a Sunfire then upgrade into this item instead.\r\nIf the enemy has AA focused comp however, keep the thornmail, it will be more worthwhile than this item.\r\n\r\n{{item:3380}} The Obsidian Cleaver.\r\nThis item is also a pretty good item when you need it.\r\nIf the enemy has no tanks, don&#039;t buy it.\r\nIf the enemy has some very tanky champions and it seems right, Obsidian cleaver will do wonders. Otherwise other items will be better.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n**The Lanes**\r\n\r\nMost players are likely already familiar with the map. We have Top Lane, Mid Lane, Bottom Lane.\r\nFor Master Yi Players, the most important of the lanes are, in order, Bottom Lane, Top Lane, Mid Lane.\r\n\r\nWhen i say gank, it does not necessarily mean scoring a kill. A Gank can simply be pressure, the enemies are scared and wont engage, relieving pressure off your laner so they can get that cannon minion.etc.\r\nOf course, scoring a kill would be even better.\r\nHere are the lanes and brief summaries.\r\n\r\nBottom Lane: There are a couple of reasons why Bottom lane is the most important part of the map for Master Yi.\r\n- Bottom lane has the enemy Carry. A Generally squishy but powerful late game carry. Ganking bot lane puts them behind, it is very important aspect of the game to ENSURE you have ended the game before they enemy Carry has FULL BUILD.\r\n- Bottom lane is a heavy game decider. Every time bottom lane is ganked, the frame of the game is tilted a lot harder than any other lane because Bot lane has 2 champions, denying 2 champions access to EXP or GOLD is much more effective than only 1.\r\nA successful takedown will surely affect the game.\r\n- A successful bot lane gank gives access to THE DRAGON.\r\n\r\n\r\nTop Lane: Top lane is also quite important for the Master Yi Player, it is generally the easiest lane to gank im my opinion.\r\n- Top Lane champions are generally Bruisers, Tanks, or sometimes mage casters or ranged carriers. When it comes to these champions, they are mostly IMMOBILE. Something any experienced player would know is to TAKE ADVANTAGE of immobile lanes.\r\n- Top lane is a solo lane, a tiltable lane. In Any lower elo games, there are high chances camping top lane will tilt the **** out of the enemy. A tilted enemy can easily tilt the game into your favor. Remember, League is a game but RANKED QUE is serious, to win you need to treat it like a war. Without using harsh language on other players, you need to win the mind game.\r\n- Successful top lane ganks snowball, making each following gank easier and easier as they are scared.\r\n\r\n\r\nMid lane: Mid lane is important for Master Yi, the con about mid lane is IT IS HARD TO GANK FOR MASTER YI.\r\nMaster Yi is a DPS dealer, mid lane is shorter therefore gives you a harder time to gank, especially when many mages there have cc or some kind of mobility to quickly disengage.\r\nThere are still quite some pros to ganking mid though.\r\n- Probably the most snowbally lane in the entire summoners rift. Getting your mid laner ahead, they can roam to help other lanes.\r\n- A weak mid laner in a team fight makes much less impact than most other champions. Unless the mid laner is something like {{champion:90}} . That champ is just there for his silence and suppression, cant be ignored.\r\n- A Mid lane gank gives access to RIFT HERALD AND DRAGON.\r\n\r\n\r\n**The Jungle and Objectives**\r\n\r\n\r\nA common misconception for lower elo Master Yi players is Powerfarming, sitting in the jungle for the first 20 minutes of the game doing virtually nothing. While the enemy {{champion:64}}  is like 15/0/3. And somehow still has more CS than you... (Its happened to me...)\r\nIf you have climbed through use of this technique, chances are you wouldnt have gotten past Gold, the higher the elo you go the more the enemy team knows what they are doing to some degree, if you dont gank and the enemy jungler does, you will almost surely lose against a team that knows how to carry a lead into victory.\r\n\r\nHere is my rundown of each jungle camp, how to do it as Master Yi{{champion:11}} , and several jungle routes i use.\r\n\r\nThe Red Buff\r\nSolo creep camp.\r\nKilling grants the Red Buff, attacks burn and slow enemies hit.\r\nUsually if you are on BLUE SIDE, or bottom side of the map, you will be starting at Red Buff.\r\nAs Master Yi, it is one of the simple camps to do. Auto attack and immediately Q to dodge its first attack.\r\nOn first clear you should not need to use your Q more than once.\r\n\r\nThe Krugs.\r\nMultiple creep camp.\r\nGrants almost 200g at later clears.\r\nGrants almost most EXP of all camps.\r\nTakes time to clear.\r\nTaking Krugs as Master Yi is generally done beyond level 3. Sometimes as the last camp before the player backs for items.\r\nFor Master Yi, a simple clear is hit it normally for 3 hits. Activate E for double strike, Q to deal damage, then smite to finish it off.\r\nFor the rest of its little spawns, Save your 2nd Q for when there are 4 creeps. It will save your time.\r\n\r\nThe Raptors.\r\nMultiple Creep Camp.\r\nGrants Generic Gold and EXP.\r\nHigh Damage Dealing Camp.\r\nDifficult to clear for inexperienced junglers early.\r\n\r\n*Taking Raptors is my second camp whenever i start on red buff.\r\nhow you take Raptors is when you clear red, you make sure you guide the buff closer to raptors camp and you have stacks of your passive Double strike when you start hitting the raptors.\r\nFor Master Yi,  you start by hitting a small raptor closest to the bush next to the camp, moving backwards diagonally towards the river, hitting a DIFFERENT one, moving backwards towards river side, and continue for about 5 autoattacks then you Alpha strike to clear the small raptors.\r\nMake sure to have used both of your potions. by the time you finish clearing this camp.\r\nA couple of advantages to clearing this camp early is that by the time you have moved to the other side of the map, cleared the camps and ganked 2 lanes at 4:30 or so, the Raptors would have respawned and you can clear Raptors =&gt; Krugs then base for around 1.2k gold.\r\n\r\nThe Blue Buff\r\nSolo Creep Camp.\r\nKilling grants a useless Level 1 buff... For virtually all junglers... (Fight me)\r\nThe buff gives 10%CDR and increased Mana Regeneration.\r\nNothing to special for Master Yi to take, just remember to alpha strike after basic attack to dodge one of its attacks.\r\nThe reason you never want to start blue side is because you have very small mana expenditure. It is a complete waste as you will be left on full mana for the entire time.\r\nBlue buff also offers nothing for early ganks, while red buff offers slow and burn damage.\r\n\r\nWolf Camp\r\nMultiple Creep Camp\r\nEasy to clear.\r\nGrants good gold and EXP.\r\nFor Master Yi, you clear this camp by hitting a small wolf first, using Q, then hitting the same wolf killing it.\r\nThen focus on the large wolf and Q once more when it is off cooldown to clear the camp.\r\n\r\nGromp\r\nSolo Creep Camp.\r\nEasy to clear.\r\nGrants good gold and EXP.\r\nFor Master Yi, clearing this camp is probably the easiest.\r\nStart with AA, Instantly Q, AA again, the Meditate.\r\nMeditate blocks off its early burst of damage, the damage it deals later is so small it is negligible.\r\nEasy to clear.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n**Ganks**\r\n\r\nThis is very straightforward, for Master Yi there are only so many ways to gank.\r\nIt is important to pressure lanes as landing a takedown wont be the easiest unless your laner has hard hitting CC.\r\n\r\nTips to ganking.\r\n1. Save your ult, don&#039;t always initiate with it.\r\n2. Buy {{item:3364}} . Use it whenever you are near the river to scan for wards, even removing enemy wards count as pressure. it is also useful for taking an early dragon.\r\n3. An Early boot. Master Yi has the highest base movement speed in the game, an early boot will help ganks work out even better, the enemy will not outrun you if they have no escapes.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis took me a while to make, I&#039;ll release part 2 for the remaining parts later.\r\nThanks for reading if you made it this far, add me in game if you need me to help with some further gameplay and stuffs.\r\nAlso consider watching some of Cowsep&#039;s videos for more in game content.
