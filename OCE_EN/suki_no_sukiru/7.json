Passive: Containment shouldn't the damage be blocked better to be 200 + lvl x 70 or 80 or 90 just not 100 pls, because at lvl 18 2000 damage is still a lot, potentially creating an extremely strong late game champion, too strong. Please lower the Q MR and Armour stats pls, btw nice name for the w xD. Still pretty broken on my thoughts but i think with a little more change it could be made a champion.\nCheers, have a great day!\nSilentXKiller","replies":[{"poster":"Suki no Sukiru","date":"2015-10-08T04:41:27.512+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"it says 100+levelx50\nNo, 2000 damage is not alot at all. lots of champions can dish out that much damage in less than 1.75 sec, i have done it before.\nAs fore the armour and MR, it is not that broken at all considering the minute damage he deals.","replies":[]}]}]}
