Orb of Life\r\nHP 700\r\n\r\nUnique Passive: Rejuvenation\r\nIncreases base health regen by 200%.

Poisonous Dagger\r\nAttack range +10\r\nAD 40\r\nAtk Speed 40%\r\n\r\nPassive: Slow Poison\r\nEnemies hit by auto attacks take a bonus 4+Lvlx2 Physical Damage every second. As well as being slowed by 8% for the duration of 5 seconds.\r\n\r\nShould Cost around 1600--2400g\r\n\r\n\r\n5.  Jet Pack\r\nNow i know this seems stupid but it actually is pretty good if it exists.\r\n\r\nArmor+30\r\nMR+30\r\nMovement Speed +25\r\n\r\nUNIQUE Active: Flies up into the air for 10 seconds, becoming invulnerable to melee attacks but not ranged and projectiles.\r\nIn Air can fly past terrain,  and gains 15% Movement Speed. However moving leaves a smoke trail for 5 seconds.

Another upgrade for the Basic Boot: Travellers Boots\r\nGains 40 Movement speed\r\n\r\nActive: Gains 25/30/35/40  movement speed on levels 1/6/11/16  for 20 seconds, ignores unit collision and the bonus movement speed is NOT effected by slows.\r\n\r\n\r\n7. The Axe of the Fallen\r\nAttack Speed +35%\r\nAD 60\r\nArmor Penetration + 10%\r\nArmor penetration + 10 \r\n\r\nPassive: The Champion that last attacked you is titled &quot;The Enemy&quot;, Attacking them causes them to take 3% Of their Max HP as Bonus TD. Can only effect one champion at a time and does not proc on Auto Aim Skill shots, Such as Kassadin&#039;s q Null Sphere, Veigars ult Primordial Burst or \r\nAkali&#039;s Q and R.  each Champion may only be effected once every 10 seconds.  Ranged attacks deal only 2% of max hp and has a 20 second cooldown instead of 10 seconds.\r\n\r\nThese are my ideas so far. If any of them are way too broken pls let me know.","replies":[{"poster":"SaltyGrandpaNuts","date":"2016-02-07T02:43:09.258+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"jesus christ that orb of life on tahm or mundo","replies":[{"poster":"Suki no Sukiru","date":"2016-02-07T03:05:17.407+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"well u have a good point i guess....","replies":[{"poster":"SaltyGrandpaNuts","date":"2016-02-07T03:17:21.559+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"or olaf with his w when he takes increased healing from all sources","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"TrashDonnut","date":"2016-02-07T02:16:44.965+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> Jet Pack\nNow i know this seems stupid but it actually is pretty good if it exists.\nArmor+30\nMR+30\nMovement Speed +25\nUNIQUE Active: Flies up into the air for 10 seconds, becoming invulnerable to melee attacks but not ranged and projectiles.\nIn Air can fly past terrain, and gains 15% Movement Speed.
