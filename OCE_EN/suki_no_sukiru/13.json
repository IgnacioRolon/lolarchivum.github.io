JAJAJA the WTF","subforum":"Player Creations","up_votes":3,"down_votes":2,"body":"This champion&#039;s aim is to annoy other champion by juking and dealin damage overtime to enemies in order to make a kill. May be simply played for the sake of annoying scrubs as well :P.\nHp 500+55.5\n5/5sec +0.15\nno mp\nAD 49.88+2.89\nAP 0\nAtk speed 0.711+0.019\nSpeed 355\nArmour 30\nMR 30\nRanged 475\n\n\nPassive-Annoy\nUpon basic attacking or Bouncing on a champion or enemy the unit is annoyed and forced to go after him for 0.75/1/1.25/1.5 sec Levels 1/6/11/16. This has a 3.5 sec CD on units hit. Or until JAJAJA moves out of 1000 range of the target.\n\nQ Mark of Flaming Failure.  13/12.5/12/11.5/11 sec\nMarks a unit making them reckless when within 750 units of JAJAJA or his clone.  Taking 10%AD +10/15/20/25/30 TD/sec. But gains 4% bonus speed.\nThis last until they get out of the zone.\n\nW Clone.   23/22/21/20/19 sec\nCreates a clone which you control while the original becomes invis and put into statis(like zhonyas hourglass)\nClone and statis last 5.5 sec. After that the clone explodes dealing 4/4.5/5/5.5/6/6.5% enemy MAX hp as Magic damage. +1% for each time they took damage from Mark of flaming failure.\nAuto attacks reduce CD by 0.75sec\nE Bounce. 8sec. \nBounces a short distance, if it is and enemy or friendly unit, he bounces further forward up to as many times as he can land on other units. The bounces will follow the mouse.\nUnits bounced on will be slowed by 33% for 1.1sec and taunted by JAJAJA as well as taking 4/5/6/7/8% current hp + 20/50/80/110/140 +15%AD as physical damage +15 for every level the enemy is.(minion count as 2, small monsters count as 2, large count as 4, epic counts as 10). First bounce is within 475units, each other bounce is increased by 75 units up to a max of 1125 units. Cannot however land within 150+75x the amount of times bounced.\nR Burst 3.5sec\nGains a burst of 30/40/50% speed for 1.5 sec and reduces cooldown of clone by 1/1.5/2 sec bounce by 0.5/0.75/1 sec.\nThis ability gains 1sec CD every time cast that stacks 10 times. Stacks are all lost after 5.5 sec of not using this ability.\nThis guy should be played as a passive farming mid laner who scales into late game .\n1v1, this guy would mark the enemy and create a clone to fight while making them take damage from Q.\nBeing chased( this is the fun part) JAJAJA has multiple abilities to annoy the living daylights out of people, by running and using clones and jumping over them as they catch up. If a group is chasing he can jump multiple times.","replies":[{"poster":"SilentXKiller","date":"2015-10-28T03:43:00.724+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I want to play him, i want to troll, i want to do random shit with him and **** everyone's lives up with it. xD","replies":[]}]}
