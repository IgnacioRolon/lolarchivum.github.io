Preferred {{summoner:11}} {{summoner:14}} . I will tell you why later but it doesn&#039;t really matter whether you bring flash or anything else. Just bring smite.... yeah...\r\n\r\n\r\nGAME BOTTOM SIDE: \r\nBegin with {{item:1041}}  and any potion.\r\nStart Q, and use it to dodge the creeps attack to save some health.\r\n\r\nYou will see who the enemy jungler is. If they are a red starting champion. Start at your red or invade blue but try not to fight.\r\nTake your red buff, don&#039;t smite.\r\nDrink one potion\r\nLearn E next\r\nGo straight to blue buff and hit the plant to get into it, this will give you a stack of your passive which helps in your Wuju Style. Drink another potion the meoemnt you get hit by the buff.\r\nMove straight onto Gromp. You shouldn&#039;t die to it if you make sure to dodge its attacks.\r\n* Take notes that if the enemy hunger is someone who likes to counterjungle. You might want to back after blue instead of going gromp.\r\n\r\nAfter this you learn W. And heal up then move on to Scuttle Crab and hit it with auto attacks to heal up.\r\nNote that right now you should NOT have used your smite.\r\n\r\nAfter this you can do 1 of 4 things.\r\n1. Gank top if they are pushed in....\r\n2. Gank mid if they are pushed in\r\n3. Go down to take raptor. Smite raptors then rugs then back.\r\nOR \r\n4. Invade top red side.\r\nWhen invading this side, generally early jungles don&#039;t take Krugs or Raptors, so you can go in with your smite and take those 2 camps. Make sure when moving to Krugs you ward between red buff and Krugs. Make sure you do not get seen by enemy minions.\r\nIf you run into them. Chances are with ignite you can fight them unless you are too low health which you shouldn&#039;t be. With Ignite you should be able to solo them and take their flash or kill them unless they have escape.\r\n\r\n\r\nI will publish the second part at some point later.\r\n If the enemy jungler start blue.\r\nI will also publish a video on my YouTube channel if you want to check it out later of a gameplay against a Tahm Kerch Jungle.\r\nhttps://m.youtube.com/channel/UC5bKpMPV_oHaU5F-yJLgxjw","replies":[{"poster":"ApolloBrahz","date":"2017-06-27T06:39:03.542+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"If the video is good I'll subscribe XDD","replies":[]}]}
