One ultimate from say a jinx/illoai in a team fight on an entire team he could just ham it and kill everyone that deals primarily AD. I could see something like that on an ultimate maybe. Like he gains bonuses whilst becoming immune to AD for a period of time or something like that.\nNot really sure on the whole concept definitely some things in it are interesting but just not in the right places and hard to also get a feel for the guy.","replies":[{"poster":"Suki no Sukiru","date":"2016-09-30T23:39:21.746+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"wait what but it reduces armor of those who have less % hp","replies":[{"poster":"Yasho The ADC","date":"2016-10-01T11:57:58.413+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Grandpa Yi,realm=OCE,application-id=hIjvqaz6,discussion-id=MyXzNEwA,comment-id=00010000,timestamp=2016-09-30T23:39:21.746+0000)\n>\n> wait what but it reduces armor of those who have less % hp\n\nPassive: Oppression of the weak.\nEnemies with less than 10/15/20/25 + 15/20/25/30%AD than Sindall deal no Physical damage to him.\nThe less than AD is doubled when below 25% HP.\n\nAttacking an opponent with less % health than him reduces their armour by 25.\n\nSo pretty much what i said is correct but i left out the fact that he will also reduce their armour(which i don't think was there when i first read it)? Reducing enemies armour whilst already being invulnerable all because you have more %hp than them isn't that balanced.

So if a team of squishy assassins attacked him in a team fight, that means that if Sindall had it at lvl 3 and someone attacked him, they would be dead due to 125 percent and Sindall is also immortal during the time. And his w is also strong due to the duration of it and the speed boost.
