Max 40%\nGold: 15\n\nEvery 5 min. Each lane will have one Corrupted Knight appear. This guy is the jackpot. But be warned if not taken down fast, it gets stronger with each minion it kills. And dont die to this guy. Other wise its pretty much game over.\nHP 2000+1000/ 5 min\nAD 250 +50/ 5 min\nAtk speed 1.25 +0.25/ 5 min\nArmor 100 +25 / 5 min\nMR 100 +25 / 5 min\nSpeed 450\nAbilities: \nAura of Destruction: Each time damage is taken from Corrupted knight, The attacked loses 20 speed, damage, armor and magic resist, every 4th hit on the same unit stuns them for 0.75 sec.

Max 90% reduction. Killing a champion spawns another wave of  corrupted knight. As well as 1 more corrupted knight per lane every 5 min. ( so if one champ dies to one corrupted knight, another 3 corrupted knights will appear at the same lane with the boosts. And every 5 min, 1 more will appear every lane so 2 every lane.)\nEffects all other corrupted knights.\nKill Gold 300 to killer and 75 global. \n\nEnemy turrets are also stronger.\nOuter turret:\nHP 5000 heal 1/5 sec\nShoots 1 missile as normal.\nDamage 250\nAtk speed 0.7\nArmor magic resist. 10 \nSPECIAL: Takes 20 reduced damage from champions. \n Attacks on same unit deals 20 extra damage.

Deals 400TD, +5% max, current and missing hp as well as applying grievous wounds for 5 sec. Is healed for the damage dealt on champions.\n\n\nNow if you did read to here, this will seem pretty hopeless...\nLuckily, there are a few items you can get to help kill the ever scaling enemy minions. As well as taking less damage from them.\n\nThese items are not built from any items as they are UNIQUE. ONLY ONE OF EACH CAN BE BOUGHT. \n\nBlade of Light.

Maybe it would be cool to turn it into something like \"light vs dark\" where one team starts as the \"Corrupted\" and the other team starts as the \"Heroes\". And each team is enhanced differently depending what side there on! Sounds like a cool game mode!","replies":[{"poster":"Talon12","date":"2015-11-12T01:59:44.942+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"or the items sold have a \"twist\" depending on team. Like say, {{item:3072}}, for corrupt team it gains a magic burn which consumes the shield on you (350 shield = 350 damage burn over 3 sec), while the light team gets a buff that increases shield by 20% (350 + 20% = 420)","replies":[{"poster":"Suki no Sukiru","date":"2015-11-12T04:35:49.973+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"yea, but the thing is with the already powerful minions. I would like this to be only one side with players. It will be player against ultra powerful minions. So basically just one team.","replies":[]}]}]}]}
