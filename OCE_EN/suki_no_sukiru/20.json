If she comes close, try to save up for a Root from E, after if you are close to her,  W Q and run again, then E to slow her down. It should deal around a third of her max hp as damage.\r\nAs well as that, engage when she just finished using all three of her Q. She is very weak without it.\r\n\r\nGo back to base when you have enough for a {{item:1029}} {{item:1001}} {{item:1036}}  and if better {{item:3047}} {{item:1053}} {{item:1037}} or{{item:3077}} \r\n\r\nYou should be wining lane if you follow these steps but if the riven is like a pro or sometin it probs wont work.....\r\n\r\nIf you see her building a {{item:3075}}  or a {{item:3143}}  or tabi{{item:3047}}  Consider getting a black cleaver and last whisper.\r\nIf not your final build should be something like this.\r\n{{item:1316}} {{item:3074}} {{item:3031}} {{item:3072}}  if you wanna go tanky get thses{{item:3143}} {{item:3065}} \r\n                                                                                               If you want to be full assassin get these{{item:3046}}  {{item:3139}} \r\nI hope this helped Just in case you need my runes and masteries \r\nRunes go something like +35 AD at level 18 and 27Armor and MR at level 18.\r\nI cant remember the masteries but its 25/2/3  \r\n/2 points on the health regen/ 3 points on the movement speed.","replies":[{"poster":"GigaPube","date":"2015-10-31T01:55:44.978+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"wot am i reading. if you hit level 2 before her you can rek her. id say the best start would be gromp then tp top and go all out hopefully before she hits level 2. you should have enough gold for long sword and cloth armour so just play aggressive and you can scare her off","replies":[]},{"poster":"Suki no Sukiru","date":"2015-10-29T21:15:47.153+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Please try it......
