Build attack speed, and you can stun for a second every 2 seconds at high levels, and have massive damage for free.\n\nHis Q just does way too much. Passive true damage/% damage/AoE splash/bonus damage to turrets. With CDR you could use it every 4 seconds or so.\n\nHis W, now this is just retarded. AD/heal/AS/Arm-MR/MS. Any one of those 5, as a 10 second buff, would be about right. Not all 5. And the values are too high, even if it were one of the 5. Compare to existing buff abilities.\n\nHis E is just a shitload of free damage. The cost in his own HP is easily negated by life leech. This just stacks up with all the other free damage you've given him.\n\nHis R is a joke. He one hits anything to heal back to full on each strike, and ignores defenses. This would pentakill in every teamfight.\n\nIf you made everything about 20% of what it is now, it would still probably be broken as fuck.","replies":[{"poster":"Suki no Sukiru","date":"2016-09-11T03:19:56.051+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"its better now i think","replies":[]},{"poster":"Suki no Sukiru","date":"2016-09-11T03:17:06.971+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"dayum.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Requiemsfire","date":"2016-09-11T02:13:14.937+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Reminds me of Sion to a degree.","replies":[]}]}
