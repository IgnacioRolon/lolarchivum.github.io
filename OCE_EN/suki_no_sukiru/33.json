SIR GERALD LIGHTBRINGER!!!","subforum":"Player Creations","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Suggested lanes: Top/ MID/ Jungle/ Possibly Support.\nBuilds: Defensive build, with possibly an armor penetration item.\n\n\n\n\nPros- \nVery Tanky yet can dish out much damage with many health and defence stat increase items\nMuch CC.\nWhen charging into a fight enemies almost cannot escape.\nFlash can be used more than just chasing and escaping.\nWise and correct timings of abilities can change the tide of the fight.\nEnemies running from him face penalties from his abilities.\nCan charge to backline to finish off enemy backliners.\nWIth good team combos, teamfights can be won very easily with Sir Geralds Combos.\n&quot;Easy&quot; CS.\nHorse gives great movement speed.\n\n(An actual reason to blame your team for not going in....  (Noobs))\nCons. \nVery high early Mana cost\nVery long ability cooldowns before rank 5.\nVery slow without horse.\nBad ability timings will make him pretty useless for quite some time.\nBeing stunned puts him at disadvantage as it disables his Passive.\nCharging in too much may have him isolated and killed.\nWithout any active abilities, Sir Gerald has to rely on team after using CC. \nHorse reduces attack speed by one fifth and reduces attack range by a small amount as penalty.\n\n\nGeneral Gameplay:\n\nCombo in Team fights: \nCharge in with Q, dismount on top of an enemy with W, cast dismounted E for buffs when facing a certain direction, Ult to regain horse and deal damage to enemies in front. Hopefully your team isnt noob and leaves you 1v5 around maybe 1500 units in the enemies backline. If they dont go in after your combo and you are not strong to 1v5 then your dead.\n\nSoloing a target.\n E, leap strike past them to get behind them while dealing damage, Q  when they are facing the other way for bonus damage and bleed. Dismount for more damage and hope for the best whithout any active abilities.\n\nGanking lanes: Use similar strategy to solo or teamfight combos. It wont be easy for enemies to get away. But beware escaping a failed gank, you will probrably die when trying to run when dismounted.\n\n\nJungle: Want to start blue buff side due to mana costs and Cooldown Reduction.\nGanking will be easy once level 3.\n\n\n\n\nSir Gerald Lightbringer\n- The Crusader\n HP 631 +98 4.28/ 5 sec +1.27\nMP 240 +58 2.18/5 sec +0.74\nAD 42 +3.8\nAtk Speed 0.634 +0.014\nArmor 20+3.1\nMR 19+2.2\nSpeed 310 (At start without Horse)\n\nLevel 18 stats\nHP 2297  25.87/ 5 sec\nMP  1,226  14.76/ 5 sec\nAD 106.6\nAtk Speed 0.872\nArmor 72.7\nMR 56.4\nSpeed 310.
