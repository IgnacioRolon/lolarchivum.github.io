The only little thing I'm concerned about is that Q passive? Maybe instead, you could have the CDR loss only work in an aura around him? So he can still have champions to have increased cooldowns but not when he isn't around (AKA global pressure). Does seem like a cool champ to play though. Nice! \n{{sticker:slayer-pantheon-thumbs}}","replies":[{"poster":"Suki no Sukiru","date":"2016-11-28T22:44:59.825+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"thanks man thats a great idea. I thought that he would be a champion who would make enemies lose CDR when killed but that is opverpowered and they are just gonna ahve  areally bad time if he just steals 50% CDR from them rip","replies":[]}]}]}
