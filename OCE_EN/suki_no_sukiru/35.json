So many times i would have won a fight with it on like 3 seconds cooldown. Can we lower the CD by like 3 - 5 seconds? It is a small change that can make good yi players feel much more comfortable.\r\n\r\nAlso his ult movement speed needs a bit of a push too. just 5% or 2% could make a difference. Movement speed is ridiculous now, so many champions can be &quot;fast as fk boii&quot;. How is Jhin running faster than a hecarim fair?\r\nDoes jhin feel like the type of champion who runs faster than a horse outta here when he shoots someone, only to return 2 seconds later to shoot the next person?? Buff his mid- late game damage, make him a little slower.\r\n\r\nBring back bonus damage to minions.\r\nI understand the funnelling thing was what caused this, and slowing his wave clear, but late game it is becoming detrimental as waveclear literally win games, anyone with some idea of how the game works will know how important having a waveclear champ is. Yi used to be able to somewhat fulfil that role, now he cant unless he gets some AOE Item.\r\nPut it to like, scale with BONUS AD on CHAMPION LEVEL, so early game it does virtually nothing, but scales a bit as you rank it up.\r\nFor example, make it scale as &quot;Deals ((Lvl x 3) - 3%) BONUS AD damage to minions.&quot;\r\n\r\n\r\nThese i feel are some quality of life changes and wont make yi that much stronger, his win rate certainly wont sky rocket with this, in an alternate universe where these changes are followed on with, im pretty sure his win rate didn&#039;t change at all.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIm sure some peeps out there thinking &quot;YI IS TOO OP!! HE SHRED ME TO PIECES WITH HIS SWORD BOOTS! DONT BUFF YI!!!&quot;\r\n\r\nFirst of all, these changes do not affect his damage output to champions in any way, especially in a teamfight.\r\nSurviving will still be up to the yi player to reflex dodge/predict with q or flash or cleansing with QSS.\r\n\r\nSecond of all, I am diamond and from most of what i see, even in diamond, people complain about yi when he is split pushing with Conqueror Guinsoos stacked full, they just challenge him then die and complain. \r\nOr in a teamfight, they missed a CC and failed to lock him down causing their team to be beaten up one by one.\r\nThats caused from either mistakes or skill, league is a game where skill should be rewarded, and mistakes punished.\r\n\r\nSince Yi is an auto attack champ, shredding is part of what all these champs literally are supposed to be. IT IS WHAT DPS IS!!!!\r\nFighting a 1v1 with a fully stacked conqueror guinsoos yi is like chasing a full ap singed with a 30MR champions building full damage, no magic resist. You wouldnt do that with a singed, doing so with a yi is the same thing. \r\n\r\nSure, YI has True Damage and most ADC&#039;s dont, but Yi is Melee.\r\nYou can peel for an adc because they are at the back shredding their front line, melee tanks and CC needs to get there, peel is all about making sure they get there slowly, or not at all so they can deal as much damage as they can.\r\nYi is melee, he cannot be peeled as efficiently by an ally, he needs true damage to shred the people that engage on him.\r\nIf Tanks cannot be killed by melee champions alone as melee champions, why play any melee champions that arent tanks???\r\n\r\nThirdly, im sure anyone who has seriously spent time to learn yi as a champion in the game understand how small but relative these changes are.\r\nThese changes can make yi better in the hands of someone who spent lots of time discovering the champion, but some random person who picks it up will take no advantage at all off these changes.\r\n\r\nI know this probably wont happen as yi is in somewhat of a balanced stage, but Riot, if anyone reads this, please consider my points.\r\n\r\nHelp me get to Challenger playing Yi.","replies":[{"poster":"DarkShade918","date":"2018-11-29T09:17:27.979+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"But Yi is too OP, and does too much damage, don't buff yi :^)\n\nIn all seriousness, i agree on the QoLs, I find Yi lacking, especially if you fall behind (Not a Yi main, i just generally shit on them because i play high CC champs and these QoLs will increase the skill requirement of defending against him) however if he gains movespeed, i think his damage needs a nerf, maybe something like removing the true damage from Wuju style but giving armour pen or something similar, because True Damage (E) + True Damage (Conqueror) + Mixed Damage (Rageblade) is a little oppressive, and even moreso when your team ints him","replies":[]}]}
