I didn't invent the gamemode but I found it on the League of Minigames page. Enjoy.\r\nRules: No autoattack OR ITEMS ALLOWED. I suggest pressing esc when in game then slelcting the game menu then turining autoattack off. Choose a champion that has a ***dodgeable*** skillshot. Heal is not allowed and neither is ignite. Ghost, Flash and barrier are all okay. Buy wards only and meet in baron pit immediately. Ward across middle of the baron pit making a line across the middle with the wards. The pit should be split into two (about even) halfs. Next, the owner of the lobby starts a countdown from 5 going 5 4 3 2 1 GO. On Go everyone starts throwing their skillshots. The team that still has players left at the end wins. Everyone goes back and buys wards again. No items are to be purchased at any point. Upon leveling up the skillshot should be top priority to max. Any other abilities are NOT allowed to be used no matter what they are. Play as many rounds as you wish (3) is a good number. To finish off everyone disconnects and restarts client. As long as everyone left the game you should not be asked to reconnect. Feel free to play any other game you want.","replies":[{"poster":"KingDinger","date":"2014-12-03T07:22:14.556+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"ive heard it was played in the middle of dominion. because baron pit sounds so small.\n\nwould be much better to play past 20 minutes in that case. because baron, lel.\n\nwould suck to play twitch till lvl 6 tho. ult totally counts as a skill shot because its dodgable! also, malz wall? lel.","replies":[{"poster":"Project Xayah","date":"2014-12-03T07:24:19.178+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> would suck to play twitch till lvl 6 tho. ult totally counts as a skill shot because its dodgable!\n\nDodgeable for some, it's still technically an auto/basic attack so would not be allowed.","replies":[{"poster":"TheUrinalWind","date":"2014-12-05T15:01:46.824+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"True^","replies":[]}]}]}]}
