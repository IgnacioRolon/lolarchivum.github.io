After reconnecting and finishing the game i was told that I would be placed in a low-priority queue. Fine, nothing I can do about it. I am here to complain that 20 minutes is WAY too long to have to wait. The 5 match ban totals 100 minutes of wasting time just for having technical difficulty. What is wrong with 10 minutes?! Seriously it's a stupid amount of time. People don't have endless hours to be pouring into a computer game. 20 mins along with patches and other things result in a massive wait time. Although I understand that leavers are a problem should there not be a warning or chance and even then 10 minutes is a long enough wait period.","replies":[{"poster":"HORSE OF FORCE","date":"2015-01-27T07:35:04.545+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I used to think it was because you have to be afk for at least 20 minutes for it to activate, so that it was some kind of psuedo-karma thing.\n\nTurns out it applies for even five minutes of afk.\n\nIt sucks.\n\n{{champion:43}}","replies":[]}]}
