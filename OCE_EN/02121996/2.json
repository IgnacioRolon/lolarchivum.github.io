We want to aim for OPL, but for now we&#039;re just looking for players. We want to see how far we can go and if we can make it to OCS then OPL.\r\n\r\nWe&#039;re currently climbing to diamond before the end of season, and hopefully challenger/master next year. If we&#039;re able to form a team and climb enough we plan to form an organization  from it and compete.\r\n\r\nWe both know that we have a long way to go - but we are willing to learn and dedicate ourselves. We give results. Thus we need dedicated players, who want to climb the 5v5 ladder and enter tournaments and aim for OCS/OPL with me.\r\n\r\nIf you can be diamond 5 or higher by the end of the season and are willing to put in effort throw me an add: Mirage Jonathaki or Mirage Shivvy\r\n\r\nCurrently seeking a Jungler, Top and Mid laner.","replies":[{"poster":"Hooked","date":"2015-11-01T07:17:50.617+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Diamond Jungler /  shotcaller add me IGN = Hooked","replies":[]},{"poster":"Caeli Pluvia","date":"2015-10-28T09:38:34.058+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"***","replies":[{"poster":"StarzAU","date":"2015-10-29T05:52:07.738+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"We're still only Plat at the moment, climbing to diamond before end of season :)","replies":[]}]}]}
