You should try Janna, Zyra, Braum or Tahm kench. Those are all good supports that can contribute much more to winning a game than Sona, and they are easy.","replies":[{"poster":"Psylock1234","date":"2017-07-19T11:47:10.072+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"i think sona is good\nshe has good damge and good heals just imagine the movement speed with quinn!","replies":[]}]}]}]}
