Anyway, the other team picked lux, so my support locked karthus (someone who he has played twice, I think, based on his mastery) and said explicitly that he &#039;wouldn&#039;t support&#039; and that he would just troll since they were on a 9 loss streak anyway. I dodged, because I&#039;m not going to spend time trying to solo lane while karthus ints. Since I dodged, and this was in my promos, I **have** to win my next game to go up. Is there anything that I could have done in this instance, except wait for riot to implement an in-lobby report feature?\r\nThanks","replies":[{"poster":"imabimabimab","date":"2018-05-02T08:01:11.516+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"not a lot can be done sadly,oce has the highest rate of entitled players per capita anywhere,its just a culture of being a jerk that is sadly accepted in Australian society,to go even deeper,its the reason no one likes Australians in the world ,were the new americans,just without the global strength really","replies":[{"poster":"DarkShade918","date":"2018-05-02T23:57:54.546+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=imabimabimab,realm=OCE,application-id=Ntey9fRZ,discussion-id=WbGeEwRl,comment-id=0000,timestamp=2018-05-02T08:01:11.516+0000)\n>\n> not a lot can be done sadly,oce has the highest rate of entitled players per capita anywhere,its just a culture of being a jerk that is sadly accepted in Australian society,to go even deeper,its the reason no one likes Australians in the world ,were the new americans,just without the global strength really\n\nNo one likes Aussies, How about Go fuck yourself.\n\nThat is over exaggerated, the real problem on our server are the Multiculturals, specifically those who speak in white boxes and have such broken English, that it's borderline impossible to understand.\n\nWe're nothing like the Americans\n- we don't have a dumbass with a small dick in high power (debatable)\n- we don't just arrest black people for the lols\n- we don't single out any 1 person, because they might blow up our cities","replies":[{"poster":"imabimabimab","date":"2018-05-05T00:35:59.989+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'm an aussie born and bred ,Anzac history,and you just proved my point,ty for your time","replies":[{"poster":"DarkShade918","date":"2018-05-05T06:24:31.147+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=imabimabimab,realm=OCE,application-id=Ntey9fRZ,discussion-id=WbGeEwRl,comment-id=000000020000,timestamp=2018-05-05T00:35:59.989+0000)\n>\n> I&#x27;m an aussie born and bred ,Anzac history,and you just proved my point,ty for your time\n\nClearly the sarcasm in \n\n\"No one likes Aussies, how about go fuck yourself\"\n\nWas misunderstood, this is me telling you that what you're saying is a load of horse shit","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"stereal","date":"2018-05-02T23:45:58.310+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Ok as an Australian you exaggerated a bit too much there, but it's somewhat accurate to a degree.
