I got my account permanantly banned due to &quot;racial&quot; words for 1 game.\n\nIn this game, Vayne (Player ID [REMOVED - [REPORTING OTHER PLAYERS](http://boards.oce.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/announcements/BjArMH2B-boards-universal-rules)]) afk from the game since his 8th death, but Kai&#039;sa (Player ID [REMOVED - [REPORTING OTHER PLAYERS](http://boards.oce.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/announcements/BjArMH2B-boards-universal-rules)]) asked me if i were trolling or not. I got 3-3-3 and highest KDA in this game. I thought that word from Kai&#039;sa is very bad, therefore I typed &quot;Australian are arrogant and talentless&quot; to response to him. Are those 2 words racist? Are those 2 words critical to ban me permanantly? Someone abused me &quot;%%%%%%%%%%%&quot; and used F-words when they fed and got flamed, but they are still active in this game after I reported for 3 times.\n\nRecently, Chinese players (both professional players and occasionaly ones) have been treated unequally due to that many autistic players who actually ruined the games. I doubt whether is this a planned and targeted racial actions. I asked Riot for explanation, the staff &quot;OPTI&quot; responded to me like this:\n\nHi again,\nI understand where you&#039;re from as you said so earlier. Your comments were racist against Australians and that&#039;s why they&#039;re not okay.\nI can look into the player who was AFK but that doesn&#039;t dismiss your negativity. Also, self defense is muting, not retaliating like in these chats.\nLet me know if there&#039;s anything new you&#039;d like to ask otherwise I&#039;ll be closing the ticket out soon.\nOpti\nPlayer Behavior and Game\nLissandra Main\n\nThen I responded as:\n\nPlease answer my questions step by step.\n1. Am I banned due to the &quot;racist&quot; comments agains Austrlians?\n2. Where do you officially define that self defense is muting? Especially after being violated and insulted by [REMOVED - [REPORTING OTHER PLAYERS](http://boards.oce.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/announcements/BjArMH2B-boards-universal-rules)] and [REMOVED - [REPORTING OTHER PLAYERS](http://boards.oce.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/announcements/BjArMH2B-boards-universal-rules)].\n3. I mentioned that I need official apology from [REMOVED - [REPORTING OTHER PLAYERS](http://boards.oce.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/announcements/BjArMH2B-boards-universal-rules)] and [REMOVED - [REPORTING OTHER PLAYERS](http://boards.oce.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/announcements/BjArMH2B-boards-universal-rules)] since they insulted me. No ban to them?\nPlease answer this.\n\nThen OPTI replied as:\nOnly For Fun,\n    1.Yes\n    2. We don&#039;t define that anywhere, I&#039;m informing you\n    3. We&#039;re not talking about them, we&#039;re talking about you. I can look in to them but it won&#039;t change things. For privacy reasons I will not be reaching out to those players for an apology.\nI&#039;m now closing the ticket, we wish you best of luck in the new games you play.\nOpti\nPlayer Behavior and Game\nLissandra Main\n\nI cannot understand the logic behind this, also I do not think OPTI can close the ticket without getting permission from me. All the reply are humiliating and I do not think those words make sense.\n\nI doubt if the reason of unfairly treating Chinese with Australian is that you are really arrogant and talentless, my words touched your sore ports and you are getting afraid to reply?","replies":[{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2018-10-11T10:51:00.105+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":">Are those 2 words racist?\n\n* \"This person is arrogant and talentless\" - **Not racist**. Rude, especially if it's uncalled for, but not racist. \n* \"Australians are arrogant and talentless\" - **Racist**, because you are slandering an entire race/community of people (Australians) based on the perceived actions of two people who may or may not even be Australian.\n\n>Are those 2 words critical to ban me permanantly?\n\nYou were punished for racism, which falls under Riot's \"no tolerance\" policy. Racist chat will escalate straight to a 14 day ban, skipping the two chat restrictions you would normally receive. If you had a 14 day ban previously, that racism will result in a permanent suspension. \n\nWhen you received your 14 day ban it would have been made clear that any further violations would result in a permanent suspension.\n\n>Someone abused me\n\nSupport stated they would look into those other players, but due to privacy policies and laws in place, they cannot and will not offer you *any* information about another player's account. That investigation is also irrelevant to your own punishment. You are judged on *your* behaviour, and only yours.\n\n[**WHY WAS I PUNISHED WHEN THE OTHER PERSON WAS WORSE OR STARTED IT!**](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/207489286-Instant-Feedback-System-FAQ-#h1q7)\n\n**Simply speaking, retaliation is not an acceptable or justifiable behavior. An argument between two players can easily create a negative experience for the rest of the players in the game with you. Regardless of the other playerâ€™s actions, this does not justify your own behavior. You alone are responsible for your actions within the game.If you encounter a toxic player like this, the best option is to simply report their behavior and move on.**\n\n>Recently, Chinese players (both professional players and occasionaly ones) have been treated unequally due to that many autistic players who actually ruined the games.\n\nIgnoring the assumption there, you seem to believe it is ok to treat people badly if they are autistic, but Chinese players like yourself are not allowed to be punished for behaviour that breaks the community rules? \n\nI am not aware of any players, professionally or otherwise being treated unequally, and certainly not because of their race. I would very much appreciate some proof to support this claim you have made.\n\n>I cannot understand the logic behind this\n\nWhat part do you not understand? Hopefully I have already addressed it, if not I would like to help you understand.\n\n>I do not think OPTI can close the ticket without getting permission from me\n\nIf the matter is resolved (no new information has been asked for or can be provided) then support are within their rights to close a ticket. They have many other people to respond to, and repeating the same information helps noone. \n\nIf you feel your concerns were not adequately addressed you can submit another ticket, though I would encourage you to ask your question here first as there may be players on boards who can help you with out creating more work for the already busy support staff.\n\n>All the reply are humiliating\n\nI can assure you that was not the intention. The support staff are bound by their policies and the privacy laws in place. So far as I can tell, the agent was simply trying to answer your questions as simply and concisely as possible. There is nothing in those ticket replies you posted that seems to indicate any attempts at humiliation.","replies":[{"poster":"Only For Fun","date":"2018-10-11T12:55:06.880+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"Thanks for the reply. To illustrate my opinions, I will list all the sentences I want to show you. Please reply step by step.\n\n1. I am not spamming, the chat history only records my words, the others are also spamming, I cannot copy their chats because it is not possible.\n\n2. About the words \"Australian are arrogant and talentless\", you should think about the actual scenario for those 3 words. English is not my native language, I am not saying to all Australian (such as the Prime Minister, ex-P.M., etc). Look at the chat history, I typed \"Australian?\" to the other 4 players, the Kai'sa (ID DS.*****, you will remove), typed \"yes\". Therefore the \"Australian\" in my chat is dedicated to this one, since I have added [REMOVED - [REPORTING OTHER PLAYERS](http://boards.oce.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/announcements/BjArMH2B-boards-universal-rules)] and he is actually Korean. I do not think that my words are racist. I am not humiliating all Australians. By the way, if the majority of Australians are not arrogant and talentless, why would they be so sensitive to these words?\n\n3. Please explain to me, i got abused as \"chin** Chon***\" for being Chinese, those words, as I know, are definetly racist. You have abosolutely no response to that.\n\n4. We have different culture, I do feel humiliated by those words from both players and OPTI. If you or that player think that was not the intention, you both can discuss with me, but I do not receive any discussion request. Also, I think I do not need to follow your culture for being able to play this game, am I right?\n\n5. If I am right to not follow your culture, I need to inform you that I, as Chinese, believe in that I should fight back when I get humilated. OPTI told me in the ticket that the way to be Sportmanship, or respond, is to mute them. I cannot agree with that, if some one killed your son or father and humiliate you in front of 10 people, is muting and enduring them the way to respond? I do not think you will be scilent at all.\n\nBased on my opinions, I do not think that response makes sence. Also I think I need the apology from both OPTI and the 2 players in that game.","replies":[{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2018-10-11T14:16:49.006+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":">I am not spamming, the chat history only records my words\n\nThe other players spamming doesn't give you a free pass to as well. You spamming as well just makes it that much worse for the 5th player in your game, but spamming is a minor offence and very rarely results in punishment anyway.\n\n>I am not saying to all Australian\n\n\"Only For Fun: this country of arrogant but talentless Australian\" You specify the whole country though? And why does it matter if they're Australian or not anyway? If someone is being an arrogant [rude word] it has nothing to do with where they are from or what their skin colour is, and everything to do with them being an arrogant [bad word]. \n\nEven with weak English I struggle to understand how \"this country of arrogant but talentless Australian\" could be intended as anything other than \"The whole country are arrogant and talentless\".\n\n>if the majority of Australians are not arrogant and talentless, why would they be so sensitive to these words?\n\nImagine this: You've just walked into a shop and I, a complete stranger, walk up to you and say \"You smell and you're ugly\". Do you have to be ugly and smelly to be offended that a random stranger would say that? That's rather absurd. \n\n>i got abused as \"chin Chon*\" for being Chinese, those words, as I know, are definetly racist\n\nI wasn't arguing that. It's a racist slur plain and simple.\n\n>\"but I do not receive any discussion request\". \n\nYou have the right to ask, and they have the right to say no. Although Support *cannot* give you details about another player.\n\n>I do feel humiliated by those words from both players and OPTI\n\nI can't comment on what the other players said, because I don't know what it was, but I ado not understand how explaining your punishment is humiliating. The support agent perhaps could have given deeper context, but given English is not your first language and the agent likely doesn't speak your first, I imagine they felt it appropriate to keep it simple and straightforward.\n\n>Also, I think I do not need to follow your culture for being able to play this game, am I right?\n\nNo. By playing on the Oceanic server, you agree to play by the rules of our community, and are subject to them just as everyone else on this server. You don't have to agree with the culture or the way things are moderated, but you have to accept that it is the way it is and remaining in the community will require you to follow *this* community's rules.\n\n>believe in that I should fight back when I get humilated\n\nIt's important to understand the difference between *defending yourself* and *retaliating/fighting back*. Defending yourself is fine (for example \"that's not true\", \"I disagree\", \"that's rude\"). Retaliating **is not** (for example \"F$$$ you\", \"trash\", \"[racist term]\". \"all your race/country is arrogant and talentless\").\n\n>OPTI told me in the ticket that the way to be Sportmanship, or respond, is to mute them\n\nIf someone is being an ass just because, then nothing you can say is going to make things better. Even defending yourself, which isn't against the rules and won't result in punishment, usually only fuels the fire of trolls and mean spirited players, so the bes tthing you can do is to simply mute them and ignore them. They're doing it for attention.\n\nIf someone is being an ass because they're frustrated (which to clarify, does not give them the right to be an ass) then you may be able to bring things back with some positivity, but negativity certainly isn't going to help things, so if you can't bring yourself to be at least neutral, then it's *safer for you* and considerate of other players to simply mute and move on.\n\n> if some one killed your son or father and humiliate you in front of 10 people, is muting and enduring them the way to respond?\n\n*You report it.* You don't go and kill their innocent son and father to get back at them.\n\n>Also I think I need the apology from both OPTI and the 2 players in that game.\n\nI don't believe the support agent has anything to apologise for. They did not insult you or anything of the sort, you asked why you were punished and he answered. What did they do that would warrant an apology? As for the players, that's just not practical. Far too many people play this game to facilitate that sort of process, and that's ignoring all the privacy concerns that go with it.","replies":[{"poster":"Only For Fun","date":"2018-10-12T04:00:54.814+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Okay, thanks for the reply. I will also list my comments and reply step by step.\n\n1. Spamming is not significant, I will not do any further comments.\n\n2. On my words specifying the whole country, I do not think that all Australians are arrogant and talentless, but I do think a lot of Australians are, especially the majority of LOL OCE players. This is based on my recent games, and also the ongoing World championship, I do not think that there are any teams right now playing group stage as OPL representatives. You know the punishment you conduct to DW's jungle player. How does that happen?\n\n3. Speaking of your recent activities on World or professional players, I do think that your actions on players are unfair and soft (no offense to you, but I mean Riot). You should learn about logic, it is never a proper way to punish the one who gets humiliated, austistic or trolled by some other people before they do something to either defend of fight back. \n\n4. If a stranger walk up to me and say \"You smell and you're ugly\", I will fight back, but I will record those humiliating words firstly. What will you do if some one come to you and say \"You are arrogant and talentless, go f*** yourself and your mom\". I believe that if the words from others are insulting enough to over your threshold deeply in the heart, you will also fight back.\n\n5. For my tickets 31942224 and 31680281, you can find my reports on racist, I have even attached figures captured during the game. But I do not find places to attach in this dialogue. The thins is, my previous report on racist is not solved even when they speak those \"plain and simple\" slurs. I am using more decent words than them. By the way, please explain why are words like \"chin** chon**\" plain and simple. I think they are the dirtiest racial words in the world. Please take this seriously and do not elaborate with only a few words.\n\n6. The difference between defending myself and fighting back, as I know, is not depending on the words you use, but the actions you take. I did not feed and throw that game, please check the game replay. Why do i have to take those words and report as I am not ruining the game? Those players who typed insulting words, afk and fed get no punishment at all, what is the logic behind that. I do not think it is the rule of community. Otherwise, I have to say that those rules suck and unfortunetely, I have to think that \"Australians, especially Australian LOL players, are arrogant and talentless, maybe some of them are even retarded and soft\". I do not want to offend any one, but the condition is I do not get offended as well. When I get insulted, I fight back. I do not think your culture is to endure and report, you will be named as coward if you do that. This is how I follow the rules of community in Australia. I am just speaking it out, and I think this is what I find after spending 4 years living in Australia.\n\n7. I do not think native language is the thing to make their reply \"simple and straightforward\". However, I do think that I have pointed out the thing that OPTI is out of logic and cannot explain to me well. That is why I need the apology from OPTI. As for the other players, I need official apology from them.\n\nPlease read about those comments and reply with real actions and logical words.","replies":[{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2018-10-12T04:44:35.884+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":">but I do think a lot of Australians are, especially the majority of LOL OCE players\n\nYou are still generalising a large number of people based only on your experience with a few. That is what discrimination is. It is the same argument that other players on boards use about Chinese people, that all Chinese players on the OCE server are toxic just because those are the Chinese people they see.\n\nIt is not fair for them to use that argument, and is racist against Chinese people, in exactly the same way as you labelling an entire population (the country or just OCE players) as arrogant and talentless.\n\n>You know the punishment you conduct to DW's jungle player. How does that happen?\n\nFirst of all, I am not a Rioter. I am a volunteer on boards, a _player_ with a coloured name. As for Shernfire's punishment. \"Specifically, Shernfire verbally abused family members of players in his games.\" His punishment had *nothing* to do with where he was from. He broke the rules, in such a way that would have gotten *any* player punished, not just a professional who is held to higher standards.\n\n> 3\n\nI'm not sure what your point is. The response to someone insulting you shouldn't be to punch them. Retaliation is not accepted, it only increases the amount of toxicity. That is the rule you agree to play by, and in playing the game you agree that breaking that rule will result in consequences.\n\n> I will fight back, but I will record those humiliating words firstly\n\nIf you aren't smelly and ugly, why would you be so sensitive to those words? Do you understand the absurdity of that argument?\n\n>What will you do if some one come to you and say\n\nI would be mad and annoyed, but I would walk away. A stranger saying that to me isn't worth engaging, and responding will only make things worse. Noone is perfect, and sometimes you might fire back, but firing back with \"your whole country sucks\" is absurd. Why insult the whole country over the actions of one person? It makes no sense.\n\n>my previous report on racist is not solved even when they speak those \"plain and simple\" slurs\n\nThat is not for me to comment on. I don't have the evidence, or any background information, and you can't provide it on boards. That is a matter for support and Riot, not for other players to judge. All we have on boards is your word that things were said, noone can make judgement on that alone.\n\n>By the way, please explain why are words like \"chin chon\" plain and simple.\n\nBecause there's no argument that it isn't a racist slur. It's like the n word for African Americans, or the f word for homosexuals. There's no question as to what the meaning of the word is, and no context where it isn't a slur because that's what the word is on it's own.\n\n>Please take this seriously\n\nIf I wasn't taking this seriously I wouldn't have bothered to write an essay length response for you. I'm trying to understand your perspective, and trying to help you understand the community's. I'd appreciate if you wouldn't dismiss that simply because we disagree.\n\n>Why do i have to take those words and report as I am not ruining the game?\n\nBut you *are* ruining that game. You only mention two other player being negative, so what of the 5th player? Why should they have to deal with you adding more toxicity to the already large pile? What about the enemy team, who came to play a fun game but instead are treated to a team that can't stop typing long enough to play properly? What about the players in your next games, given that this wasn't your first offence?\n\n>Those players who typed insulting words, afk and fed get no punishment at all\n\nYou don't know that. You have no way of knowing that. That information is not publicly available. A clean account with no prior negative history will be treated more leniently than an account with that negative history like yours, but you don't have the whole story, and neither do we on boards.\n\n>\"Australians, especially Australian LOL players, are arrogant and talentless, maybe some of them are even retarded and soft\"\n\nYou claim to hate racism, since those words used against you are in your own words \"the dirtiest racial words in the world\", and yet your response, instead of taking the high road is to fire back with exactly the same thing you claim to hate so much?\n\n\"Chinese, especially Chinese LOL players, are arrogant and talentless, maybe some of them are even retarded and soft\"\n\nHow is that not racist? Unless you believe it's only racist if it said against your own race? That is fundamentally not how racism works.\n\n>you will be named as coward if you do that\n\nThe cowardly thing to do is to lower yourself to their level. Especially in situations like this, it isn't hard at all to be the better person. If they aren't allowed to be racist and rude, why should you?\n\n>This is how I follow the rules of community in Australia.\n\nIn that case you will continue to be punished. \n\nhttps://oce.leagueoflegends.com/en/game-info/get-started/summoners-code/\n\nhttps://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/207489286-Instant-Feedback-System-FAQ-\n\nhttps://oce.leagueoflegends.com/en/legal/termsofuse (particularly 5: Code of Conduct)\n\n>However, I do think that I have pointed out the thing that OPTI is out of logic and cannot explain to me well.
