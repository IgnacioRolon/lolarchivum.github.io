If you want any sort of specific feedback, however, I'd recommend posting your chat logs. If you'd just like to appeal your punishment, you can submit a ticket to player support: https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/requests/new\n\n>I got punished? They do not?\n\nJust because you received punishment, doesn't mean no-one else did. Riot keeps punishments private to just the individual involved for a variety of reasons - privacy, reform and anti-witch hunting being the biggest.\n\n>Is ruining someone else's game acceptable?\n\nNo, it isn't, but neither is retaliation. To be clear, there is a difference between defending yourself (fine) and retaliation (firing back)(not fine). Even if you were to excuse revenge type behaviours, there are still 3 other players on your team that now have to deal with two toxic players instead of one. Again though, there isn't much we can offer in the way of specifics without knowing what you were punished for.","replies":[]}]}
