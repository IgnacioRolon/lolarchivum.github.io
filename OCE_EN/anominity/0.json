We have the cruddiest internet in the world. There are third world countries with better internet than us (and cheaper). Our NBN is costing us so much and they are still doing the rural areas, not the cities or major areas that actually need it. If I am on NA I use to get 180 ping, now its around 300. Until our over the price internet companies and politicians all pull their socks up, we are going to have overpriced crud internet here. Sorry to hear you xferred. I bet Riot won't even allow you a free xfer back. Money motivates Money","replies":[]}]}
