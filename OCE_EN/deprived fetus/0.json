You'll get around the same elo as you did in the last season no matter what, so if you were Gold 5 last season you'll get SIlver 2, 1 and Gold 4 depending on your wins and losses","replies":[]},{"poster":"Sloth Almighty","date":"2016-09-25T23:11:31.312+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'd be happy to win 1 out of 10 ranked games, so you've done well xD","replies":[]},{"poster":"Gilb","date":"2016-09-25T23:06:12.693+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I just went 9-1 on a second account and got gold 2, so it all depends on who you play against.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Cuddly Panda","date":"2016-09-25T22:35:34.234+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I remember Arcsecond going 10-0 on a fresh account and ending up in Platinum V, so that's certainly possible. You probably just won the right games against the right opponents (you were facing Gold 1-4's and Plats during your last provisionals, so there's that).","replies":[]},{"poster":"Unfriending","date":"2016-09-25T21:36:49.426+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I was under the impression that 10:0 was enough to get you anywhere up to platinum, but for all you know the teams you faced off against were of a very high tier so you got more credit for winning. It's certainly questionable especially because 10 games can choose where you go and climbing takes FOREVER, which is really bad if you get unlucky during placements or are new to ranked and have no clue.","replies":[]},{"poster":"CHEESYLEEKS","date":"2016-09-25T20:21:29.235+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Nice bud,well done","replies":[]}]}
