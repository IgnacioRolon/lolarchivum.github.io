League can be run on more than one OS, and it's possible that there's a setting you just haven't seen/changed on Windows across all your devices. Also, reinstalling won't indicate to you if it's a config problem or not, *because if the problem is with the default settings...*\n\nMorally incorrect, however. Programmers should make their programs run without requiring the user to change their personal settings. And in the rare case that it's absolutely required (like a whole environment or a server program), then it should be made crystal clear that this needs to be done before the program is installed.\n\nGetting a bit off-topic...\n\n>I have not tried using a different router/modem as I do not have spares, or the know how to switch them\n\nNah, that's ok. You should be able to find a fix without going to that extreme, if your connection is still working for other services. It just would have been handy. :P\n\nTry lowering your internet security. Sounds insane, but sometimes it prevents a video-game (sometimes considered **the purest form of malicious software** to certain anti-virus softwares) from connecting to the internet. You can do this by disabling your firewall and anti-virus (if you're only testing out just this game, and not anything else like browsing the internet or streaming, then you're pretty safe) and then running the game. If that still fails, then you can try uninstalling those security measures (some like to actually edit system configurations, and revert them when they leave, or will still run in the background even if you've disabled it), but just make sure you have a way of getting them back (especially if they're paid software).\n\nTo go even further, go to your Internet Options (accessible from the Control Panel), reset all the settings to their default if you've changed them, and then set the security for the Internet from whatever it is to Low. Or the lowest available, if it's been limited on your computer. If you do that, tell me which level it is so I can see what's still activated.\n\nSorry for that wall of text, but if you're stuck with nothing to do because you can't play then I guess I just did you a favour, albeit a boring one.\n\nBest of luck!","replies":[]}]}]}]}
