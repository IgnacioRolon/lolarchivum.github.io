Did you happen to notice if she had the purple health on her bar? Cause if that wasn't there, would indicate simply a visual bug, otherwise could indeed be some interaction with the silence. Knowing some of the random bugs that pop up in this game could be just about anything causing it. Could be cause it's the same champ so it thinks the shield can't be cast even though it has been, but I feel like that makes a bit too much sense for spaghetti code. I don't know squat about coding and all that so I'm just guessing here.","replies":[{"poster":"Skaev","date":"2015-10-19T08:00:02.873+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"i must admit i did not pay attention to whether the purple health was there.\n\nhowever it should be relatively easy to test in custom games, get a blitz on one side morgana and one other on the other side, get blitz to silence. react with blackshield after the silence then have blitz use rocket grab\n\nwill clearly show how the interaction plays out","replies":[{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2015-10-19T08:16:50.378+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"true enough, but it could be a bug related to one for all, in that it may have been the morg was shielded by a diff morg WHILE she was silenced which caused the strange interaction, rather than simply a black shield following the silence. In which case it isn't something that would come up in norms/ranked at all and wouldn't have been discovered till now.","replies":[]}]}]}]}
