And recently (6-7?months? ago) I got my first ban (well, proper ban). Which i accepted and played through, i knew i was being an idiot. \r\n\r\nIt&#039;s been 6-7months now, and i have FINALLY reached honor level 1 again (milestone 0). I haven&#039;t been chat-restricted or penalized in the slightest (i definitely have shut up in chat, thats for sure). \r\n\r\nThis isn&#039;t so much as a complaint, as a query, Why does it take so long? I understand it&#039;s probably because i don&#039;t play as much as others? Full-time Job and all. \r\n\r\nI was really excited to see CLASH be introduced, and i had a huge feeling that it would follow the other game-types of &quot;Honor-level2 requirement&quot;.\r\nHowever with the current climbing of my honor.. i find that i wont be able to play Clash all year, which is kind of a bummer tbh. \r\n\r\nThis thread is really just about asking a few questions:\r\n\r\n 1. Why does it take so long? \r\n\r\n2. If i played 5x the amount of games, would i reach it faster?\r\n\r\n 3. shouldn&#039;t 6-7months be enough to show reformation? Especially on an 8year-old account that was previously unbanned? \r\n\r\ntl;dr. 6-7months of reformation, still honor level 1 (milestone 0), why is it taking so long to climb?","replies":[{"poster":"QAPLA","date":"2018-05-21T16:19:23.433+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I don't know bro, I was honour 5 all last season and I'm currently honour 3 now (and climbing).\n\nIt's not hard, if you just curb your hatred for morons (I know many bans are provoked, and the provocateur is never  punished).","replies":[]}]}
