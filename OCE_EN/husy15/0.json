Distinguishing a toxic player:\nYou can go 10-0-10, have 7cs/min, never type anything, use few pings, and still be very toxic.... how?\n\nHow you play the game... and it&#039;s not report-able in the slightest.\n\nif a teamfight starts, and you spam your mastery emote while watching your team die, then proceed to get a penta... is that not toxic? Well Riot.. according to everything you say.. no, it isn&#039;t.. not in the slightest\n\nIf you&#039;re a jungler, sit in jungle all game, refusing to gank, refusing to capture objectives (Drag, turrets, etc). Can you be reported for being afk? No.. because technically you werent AFK, even though you weren&#039;t actually doing anything all game..\n\nif you repeatedly Ping people at every slight mistake they make, but not say anything in chat, can you be banned? No... and this is probably the major reason Spam-Pinging is a thing..\n\nand Yes. Muting pings, muting people, are entirely possible... However:\n\n2. Once tilt has started, it&#039;s going to snowball, regardless of any further input:\n\nif you MIA-ping spam someone on giving first blood... and then they mute-all and all-pings... that doesn&#039;t automatically make everything OKAY, they will still be tilted slightly...\n for starters: They&#039;ve lost the start of their lane, they are behind, and their team is calling them out...\n\nSecondly: The psychology behind being tilted isn&#039;t going to fade just because they muted someone... VERY FEW people are un-tiltable.. including Pro-players... heck while it&#039;s a tool-tip (Be untiltable) it&#039;s pretty much impossible.. you will be tilted.. and every further mistake you make will make it worse.. it will snowball, regardless of what you assume.\n\nThis in of itself is a problem... because i have played MANYY games at which i&#039;m spammed mia pings, for small mistakes which won&#039;t matter much to the overall game. and yes, most of the times i ignore it, and play on, and still end up playing decently well (However and obvious worse game than others).. \n\nhowever:\n\n3. Knowing people who are Toxic like this will never be stopped or reprimanded:\n\nThis is probably the most tilting thing in the game.. entirely.. it puts me off from continuing to play this game, because Riot has no implements currently to stop toxicity like this. At all...\n\nfor starters you can&#039;t report people for spam-pinging... and most likely they wont get banned for it.\n\nsecondly... AFK farming.. is still seen as a &#039;proper&#039; way to play this game (I have no clue why.. but it is).\n\nhaving someone purposefully allowing their team to die in every teamfight.. isn&#039;t reportable either..\n\nBeing a jungle, taking the laners kill, and all their cs.. isn&#039;t reportable.. \n\nwhich brings me to:\n\n4. Making a lane worse for your team...\n\nYes this happens.. whether jungling or not, there are a lot of things you can do to destroy your own teams lane..\n\nwhether it be: \nTake all their farm.\nDeny them of kills\nbaiting them to fight\nEtc...\n\nit happens.. now normally this doesn&#039;t matter... Unless its purposeful.\n\nYes, this will finally be an example from a recent game:\n-greedy khazix jungle\n-me as camille top\n\nI wanted to play safe, retreat pinged him on his attempt to gank, regardless he ganked, and we both died. (i was low, and he was oom).\n\nhe then decided that my lane was up for grabs, constantly coming top and taking all my farm, and every time i was close to getting a kill, he would flash or purposefully jump in to steal it...\n\nCamille is a mid-lategame champion, with her early-game being weak.. taking a LOT of gold to actually become decent/strong..\n\nthis just makes your job 100x harder... 40farm down, 0 kills, you haven&#039;t finished your first item, while the jungler is 10-3 with 30 more farm than you..\n\nAnd even if you win the game... who is seen as the bad player? the person who purposefully ruined the lane? no? hes 10-3 with 200farm... the camille dealing 0 damage and not being tanky... while not dying.. is bad.\n\nwhich brings me to:\n\n5. There is nothing Riot is doing to stop this..\n\nAfter games like that. you want to stop playing temporarily, to cool-off, de-tilt. Etc.. and while i have a 64ish?% winrate in Ranked Solo... it&#039;s mainly because im only playing 1-2 games per day.. due to tilting parties like this..\n\nI just had a real bad game, and probably wont play all day... mainly because my behaviour to the tilt was also terrible... however, being given such a terrible experience you have nothing you can do.. the player who ruined your experience.. will never be banned.. because they haven&#039;t done anything according to Riot and the Rules list..\n\nso.... Solution:\n\nBe able to report for these reasons... make it an actual thing that can be penalized... \n\nPlayer experience is important.. and if everyone who plays, gets turned off by people like this.. who are never banned, reported, or penalized.. then it&#039;s just ruining your reputation..\n\nYes, it will be harder to determine.. considering the significant amount of reports that probably land on your lap constantly.. however, even the fear of it being a reportable offense.. will lessen the toxicity.\n\nI&#039;d love a respectable conversation below. While this is a topic that can get heated, it shouldn&#039;t have to come to that.\n\ntl;dr: there are a lot of issues with toxicity that are being overlooked, 5 main points which show that currently Riot is ignoring a large portion of toxicity in the community.. \n\n**Poll Below on whether or not you think this is accurate:**\n\n**EDIT: For anyone voting in the Dis-agree portion, i'd love to hear reasons, or atleast input? **","replies":[{"poster":"Krispy Migraine","date":"2018-03-15T05:14:45.398+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"seems extremely detailed","replies":[{"poster":"Husy15","date":"2018-03-15T06:52:51.160+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Wanted to explain my point as best as i could, rather than just saying \"League is toxic, fix it riot\" because i very much do agree that it is a difficult thing to deal with, toxicity which is extremely hidden","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"LegendOfswords","date":"2018-03-28T17:33:56.675+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"> Yes, this will finally be an example from a recent game:\n> -greedy khazix jungle\n> -me as camille top\n> \n> I wanted to play safe, retreat pinged him on his attempt to gank, regardless he ganked, and we both died.

Yeah you might of wanted to \"play safe\" that doesn't mean you are like a god in game and everyone should listen to what you want in ranked or not.. Yeah granted it sounds like a bad time to gank your lane but if your that low your dying 2v1 you probably should of recalled sooner obviously a few things depend on this like if you're last hitting under tower for an item or u don't wanna miss a big wave etc. Also at the end of the day do u really care who considers you a good and bad player in 1 solo q game? if you really are that good you're gonna win most of your games and your stats will say so, so why bother about what a couple of randoms say particularly if you win the game... Take the lp and move on. \n\nI mean this is minor toxicity at the very most you can certainly work around.. its not like the dude was inting or even flaming in chat. You can usually just push the side lanes to gain your cs back and yeah.. I dunno it just comes across as you would be 10/10 triggered if the jungler pushed the wave to tower after ganking and killer enemy laner. And in regards to your spam emote section and the penta kill yeah that's pretty bm but on the other hand a guy got a penta so hopefully u pick up the win take the lp and u move on.  (NO ONE WILL EVER GET BANNED FOR THIS)  But yeah i feel you. but there are definitely work arounds.. just be grateful no one is running it down mid 10 times in ur game","replies":[{"poster":"Husy15","date":"2018-03-29T00:11:49.190+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I might have really explained myself and the situation badly i guess, i was trying to make an analogy to explain what i meant. However i do disagree with your first point.\n\nAs someone who has played a lot of jungle myself, i know the first rule of ganking... is to make sure your laner is in with you.. unless you can guarantee a solo-kill\n\nin my situation, as camille top, i know i can farm easily, gain my health back with W(Which also pokes), and stay safe without dying with my hookshot. i wasn't at risk of dying, and recalling 40seconds before my TP came back up, would have been a little bad in the situation. nonetheless, i saw the situation and retreat pinged knowing the gank would go badly.. (Me knowing the strength of my lane opponent at that time, knowing he could kill us easily)\n\nhowever none of that really matters, it was just a back-drop setting of the events that took place. which was toxic and very much hidden under Riots current rule system... \n\nIt is VERY easy to make one of your own teammates behind in a game.. it's very easy to ruin their entire lane, jungle, or just outright constantly get them killed. take smite mid, smite ur junglers first buff, and then proceed to steal his jungle... i guarentee you he will be useless.\n\nand with the current rule system.... The person being toxic in reality, is not.. because their score is fine.. while the poor jungler that went 2-8, had 5 levels down, and didnt secure a single buff for himself... is seen as INTing..\n\nAnd yes, this is \"minor\" toxicity at most... however it's very prevalent in the game... and not just at my MMR, i often play against/with plats/diamonds (especially last season), and it's still very prevalent.. People who just don't care about making the game worse for other people, who go out of their way to ruin their experience, yet nothing is done?\n\nWhat i tried to convey with my post (However realized i failed), is that work-arounds to the current rule system are very easy to find, very prevalent in the current game, and honestly just make everyone's experience so much worse. With at least acknowledging some of this toxicity, Riot may be able to reduce it, however they don't recognize it at all, and that's where my issue lies. \n\n\"(NOONE WILL EVER GET BANNED FOR THIS)\"  This was the issue i have. The \"get over it and start another game\" Mentality, as i said in my Original post, this isn't about me not getting over a single game. this is about what these games do to the players:\n\n-You tilt, regardless of how hard u try not to, your performance will be worse. \n\nAs for me, as i stated above, whenever something annoys/tilts me in a game, i usually take a break (or atleast from ranked, i usually just ARAM), either for an hour, or a day, maybe a few days. For multiple reasons, i know that me playing ranked after that won't do me any good. \n\nIt isn't a good experience, not for me, not and not for the majority of players... so many people have an issue with these small bits of toxicity, yet nothing is being done or said.","replies":[{"poster":"LegendOfswords","date":"2018-03-29T13:44:06.885+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thankfully i can speak as a jungle main myself which should help me with getting your perspective abit I mean i dunno if that's the first rule of ganking but sure okay I mean clearly it was a bad gank, if he had done these types of ganks over and over you might have an issue. But in all honesty if u were oom and he was low u should of just let him die. You can't control others bad play and considering you knew full well it was gonna be a fail makes it worse. And yeah that example you gave about the smite mid is legitimate of course that would likely set u back 10 mins depending on the type of jungler your playing and well maybe it might be seen as a poor game but probably not inting because its highly unlike that situation would happen every game. \n\nAnd i mean they hardly have a system to get hardcore inters banned let alone any kind of behaviour like this and i agree id like to see something happen as well but its a long long way off. The only reason i have that mentality because i've been in your position but i have learnt to accept that f all will be done and its out of my control entirely. Honestly the best thing u can do is mute all can play the game to the best of your ability.. its unfortunate but nothing is going to change. You could soft int for the rest of your life and be fine. gl.","replies":[]}]}]}]}
