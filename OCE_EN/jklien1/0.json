They are just annoying in such and just having a bad kit. I'm just quite disappointed. this gonna have so much hate lmao.\n\nLet's talk about the champion releases first.\nSo it all started in 2017 when the new champion 'Zoe' came out. If anyone was there when Zoe first came out, we could agree that she was an unhealthy champion. Remembering her kit was how she could one shot everyone with Q. Her W was so way too handy. Her E was quite a pain if you got caught in it, a slow and then a stun, which obviously could lead to a Q one shot. And her R just made her Q have more dmg. \nI can see how Zoe can be nerfed, but the actual champion and her kit is quite annoying to go against. I think that no one would want to go against a very good Zoe, saying that Zoe can certainly still one shot nowadays and is just ANNOYING.\n\nThe next few champions that were released this year was Kaisa, Pyke, and Neeko. I could literally explain how badly made each champion was made, but it would take too much time. We can see that all these 3 champions have been nerfed/will be nerfed significantly for being broken. And all these 3 champions are annoying in such a way of how their kit is like. Kaisa could 1v5. Pyke's mobility, ult is a joke. And Neeko right now is absolutely just an annoying piece of ____. All of these champions, in my opinion, are just ANNOYING to go against. But I can tell that these champions aren't as annoying as the reworks.\n\nNow the reworks. Yes. The newer released reworked champions are the same as the new champions released. Just the same unhealthy kit as a champion. The list is such as Swain, Irelia, Akali, Urgot, kinda evelynn ect.\nThey all IN MY OPINION OK are unhealthy.\nThe other reworks such as Aatrox, Nunu are not so successful\nI can see people say like: \n'oh just ban the champion then' oh I my self can't ban 10 different champions can I? sadly :(\n\nwe can also see such a pattern, oh released new champion or rework? The champion then gets played and the next few patches they nerf the same champion over and over and still, the champion is unbalanced.\n\nOverall, I just think They need to work on the champions a bit better. And actually look into them.","replies":[{"poster":"Lord Sesshomaru","date":"2018-12-13T13:11:33.160+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Personally, I think Zoe is pretty balanced (and yes I was there when she came out, and I still didn't find her a problem then).\n\nUnlike so many other champions, she has to aim and land the abilities that give her that 1 shot potential. And they require a lot of setup if you want to use them effectively.  Plus nothing she has (of any real threat) goes through minions. On top of that, she has no escapes. So assuming you have your wits about you, she's got a very generous amount of counterplay. Especially in comparison to older champs like Zed or Fizz that ultimately control the lane just by being in it.\n\nPyke I don't think is that bad either.\nyea he's annoying, and gets some pretty free personal utility. But it's not like he cant be killed. And he doesn't bring a lot to the table in terms of actual supporting. So yea while the individual champ is annoying, he doesn't bring much to the team that cant be brought by other champs. The only thing he has that is actually purely unique to him, is his gold sharing ability. Other champs have pulls, other champs have dash/stuns, other champs have invisibility, other champs have grey heath regen, other champs have chain ult executes. So while he is pretty dangerous as a single champion, in terms of a team comp, he doesn't bring a lot of new things to the team.\n\nKai'sa is strong late game, like many ADC's are supposed to be. But from what I see she isn't that much stronger than other ADC's.\nShe is probably easier than some. But once they reach lategame, I don't think she shines that much more than others, at least not in the elo where I see her.\n\nEvelynn isn't too bad, purely because she can actually be killed, unlike the rest. \nShe deals a lot of damage and comes out of nowhere, but id still rather vs her than Zed or many other assassins.\n\nThe others you mentioned definitely err on the strong side though.\n\nI will admit, selfishly I thoroughly enjoy Swain being easy/strong though.  Most of my champs require a lot of mental energy and focus, Azir/Sol/Taliyah/Kindred/Kalista etc. And its so nice to have a champ I can rely on like Swain, where you can just let go for a couple of games and relax while playing. Objectively, yea things come much easier to him than other champs. I probably have to put in twice the effort as Azir to get the same results as Swain. However, despite being marketed as a tactician, Swain's kit doesn't provide that much tactical diversity.  When you're ahead, you wade into fights as a giant demon spamming Q and win. When you're behind, you wade into fights as a giant demon spamming Q and lose.\nWhere as champs like Azir can adapt (with greater efficiency) to a far larger variety of situations and play around them better.\n\nAkali re-enters smoke too quickly, I couldn't even hit her with my targetable abilities because between the time where I saw her exist stealth, and I moved my mouse to her and pressed the button, she had entered stealth again. But like Evelynn, at least she sacrifices survivability for damage.\n\nUrgot and Aatrox definitely have too much damage for how survivable they are _(and i'm a lvl 7 Aatrox player, so when I say that, you know i'm not being bias)_.  Urgot in particular, shouldn't have the damage he does for how hard he is to kill. Like Garen and Mundo. At least Aatrox though isn't easy, and does require a fair bit of mechanics to actually get to a point where you are that monster.\n\nAnd Irelia is just straight up fucked. \nI genuinely don't even know how to defend her.\nEven if I play her, I have no idea what's going on, everything she does is so fast I cant even follow it. She goes from a standstill to dashing round you faster than Barry Allen, 10000 blades flying everywhere. Sometimes theres a stun that happens somewhere within the chaos. And then someone is dead.\nShe is the champ that has everything.  Damage, Tankiness, mobility, Hard CC, Zoning, Soft CC, Anti-shield, etc.\n\nIn my opinion of course.\n\n_(If someone can give me some tips on vsing irelia I would be very grateful.)_\n\nAnd Neeko hasn't been around long enough to get a proper handle on her place within the game.  When a champ comes out, its easier to learn how to play them than it is to learn how to play against them. So right now, theres a lot of people who have already played her enough to get good at using her.  But we are all still figuring out how to play around her.  So far though, her ult seems to have a really decent amount of counterplay. It's not like she can just pop it whenever, it takes some setup, and a solid chunk of time, part of which she is immobile for.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Gol Acheron","date":"2018-12-13T14:31:06.597+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I think that the Nunu and Aatrox reworks turned out okay, especially aatrox as a champion he is really cool imo.\nBut some new champions have been pretty cancerous to verse and were a disaster since release imo, zoe, ivern and neeko.\nI do believe however that they can be fixed with the right fine tuning.","replies":[{"poster":"DarkShade918","date":"2018-12-14T06:51:30.847+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Gol Acheron,realm=OCE,application-id=Ntey9fRZ,discussion-id=qWXqxUKu,comment-id=0002,timestamp=2018-12-13T14:31:06.597+0000)\n>\n> But some new champions have been pretty cancerous to verse and were a disaster since release imo, zoe, ivern and neeko.\n\nIvern????, dodge the root, no more problems\nNeeko isn't hard to vs either, just dodge the cc, and don't get caught out with the fake neeko\nZoe is the only cancerous champ, but she has counterplay, you see her ult, boom you get free CC and free damage, dodge the sleepy bubble, not difficult in anyway shape or form (unless it comes from Fog of War, in which it's still easy to dodge, you just get less time to respond, its called not having slow reaction speed)","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"OCEshots","date":"2018-12-14T02:41:18.764+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"to think neeko is hard to vs and unkillable is questionable.
