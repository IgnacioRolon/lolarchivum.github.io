Regrettably, I'm unable to provide an estimate for the completion date at this time. It sounds like you just experienced what we refer to as a \"ghost game\". This happens when the game server you were playing on fails to communicate the game-end message to the client. This issue holds the account in limbo and you may not be able to play until it's released.\n\nThe 'limbo' will last typically 2-3 hours to give the server a chance to resync itself but it can go a bit longer. It's likely that we will not be able to recover the stats (LP/IP) for the game that was affected. Please refer to the server status page for more up-to-date details on the situation:\n\nhttp://status.leagueoflegends.com/#oce","replies":[{"poster":"Nasus Bot","date":"2017-09-26T01:10:19.119+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"and i JUST WON A GOOD GAME!!!
