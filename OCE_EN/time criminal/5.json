(I apologize for being ignorant but I don&#039;t know what languages they all are) I submitted a ticket to support asking if you could change it already, and they said to post on the boards, because &quot;specialized people are frequently looking here for things players think could be improved. \n\nAs a bonus, the 14/15 of you who don&#039;t like the people saying &quot;OCE if only English&quot; and other racist (languagist?) stuff like that (those people will likely now hate me xD) will have all their arguments, sorry, their one argument made worthless.\n-------\nIf you guys agree could you comment and say the languages you think should be added?\n-------\nTL;DR: I think OCE needs more than just English, comment if you agree.\n-----\nJust checked this again, and it has 108 views, yet no positive comments. Is it really that out of almost 110 people nobody wants another language than just English?\n\nAt the very least could we get support for Korean and Chinese on the new client, so we can get them by changing files like some of the other languages.","replies":[{"poster":"Best Evelynn OCE","date":"2017-11-07T00:33:07.342+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I like the idea.\n\nNew Caledonia is closer to New Zealand than Australia is, and they speak French. I guess the Cook Islands and Samoa would count, and their spoken languages?","replies":[{"poster":"Time Criminal","date":"2017-11-07T03:45:16.880+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Samoa is Samoan (duh :P) and Cook Islands is Rarotongan.

You're on a server with people that report people in complete seriousness because they're not speaking English. You can't expect these people to understand that in a game where thinking is key, not wasting ten minutes per game typing a language you don't know fluently is a deal breaker. They also don't understand that some people don't have English keyboards and typing English characters takes longer.\n\nThis server is a joke, you'll get used to it. Kids hiding behind people not speaking English when they lose because they're hardstuck silver trash.","replies":[{"poster":"Time Criminal","date":"2017-11-06T23:38:42.695+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I didn't think anything would come of it, and I know people report people because they don't speak English. I was just hoping that maybe some people that felt the same as me could comment, and maybe a Rioter could notice, and maybe we could get more languages than just English, or at least an easy way to add more languages that aren't English. I know this is a lot of maybes, but it is possible.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Waysted1","date":"2017-11-06T22:43:56.385+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"personally i dont care what language you speak just dont be surprised if no one understands you. if i went to china and played on their server i wouldnt demand they spoke english nor would i expect to be understood by everyone who i played with. i would learn the language of the country im in. to do otherwise would be racist and arrogant","replies":[]}]}
