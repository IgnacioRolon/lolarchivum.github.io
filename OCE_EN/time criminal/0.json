(Advice please)","subforum":"Esports","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"Firstly, I made a post a while ago similar to this asking [how to become a pro league player](https://boards.oce.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/esports/N1P4uILE-how-does-one-become-a-pro-player). I got a really nice response from Akkordian Zoeve (if you&#039;re reading this, thanks for that.) \r\n---------\r\nThat was about 9 months ago, and now I&#039;m making a similar post, asking people for information about how to become a professional eSports shoutcaster. I think it would be really cool to be a play-by-play caster for the NA LCS or the OPL but I only have a vague idea of how I&#039;d go about doing that. I&#039;ve been practicing shoutcasting over other pro games, but I don&#039;t know how to go any further than that. I&#039;ve seen people say that you should get a degree in sports analysis, and I&#039;ve seen other things saying a bunch of major casters have degrees in completely different things. Also once I got good at shoutcasting how would I go about applying to Riot Games. \r\n---\r\nThanks in advance for any help!\r\nTime Criminal\r\n{{sticker:slayer-jinx-catface}} \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nreally hoping someone from riot sees this lol","replies":[{"poster":"RUSTYtheCASTER","date":"2018-07-24T10:34:46.574+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey mate, Rusty here! I work on the LPL in China and have worked on the OPL before so perhaps I'm able to offer an insight you may find valuable! lets jump in:\n\n> I've seen people say that you should get a degree in sports analysis, and I've seen other things saying a bunch of major casters have degrees in completely different things.\n\nTo address this part first, you don't need a degree in anything to be a Shoutcaster, no form of pre-requisite studies are strictly necessary by any means. I studied Primary Teaching as an example. Now, for the bulk of the post to answer your main question.\n\n>  I've been practicing shoutcasting over other pro games, but I don't know how to go any further than that.\n\nShoutcasting is an art form and so much like many other arts it's subjective as to what is perceived as good or bad, the reason I bring this up is because if you want to take it further than you currently have you need to be perceived as good by those you are trying to attract to your craft! My advice for this is to look, learn and listen from the currently existing assets at your disposal, the current global Shoutcasting teams. \n\nShoutcasting over pro games is a great place to start! You can practice in your bedroom over Soloq, over your friends games and ask them for feedback on your calls of their plays, my personal favourite method is to cast over pro games, and then listen to what the pro shoutcasters said to compare and contrast points to learn about what they are saying and how they are saying it.\n\nThis is all for the craft itself, and speaking of craft, here is a video Riot Games Oceania released regarding the craft of Shoutcasting and a bunch of things that go into it. This is a pretty comprehensive video so I would recommend giving it a listen!\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6cRZfFAJWKM\n\nPast improving the craft of Shoutcasting (ask my anything you'd like and I'll try to answer it if you need) your questions were more directed to how do I become a Shoutcaster somewhere big. First of all, practice your bum off until you're good enough! Secondly, create a portoflio of all of your best works! if you are going to apply for the role of Shoutcaster anywhere in the world, you'll need to compile a list of what if effectively \"reasons they should hire me\" into a document, just like any art would work!\n\nIf there are job openings in regions you'll usually find them on the Riot hiring websites, I don't have the link handy but a quick google will find that one. If there aren't opening seen but you want to get your name out there, try reaching out to other Shoutcasters for feedback! Prove you've done all of the above work and that you're committed and it's very hard for any of us to say no to helping you out with a feedback session of VOD review.\n\n**Think of Shoutcasting like you would hiring an artist to draw you, you'll search for someone and only the most known will come up first, but they will have recommendations if they are busy and that is usually where you will start! From there if you've proven yourself then the jobs may come, but it's a small industry so note that there's no such thing as a promise! Just hard work and commitment.**\n\nLastly, work hard but be humble. We've all worked hard to be where we are and we can only hope that if you're trying to make it to the top, we'll find a mutual respect for the efforts you put in, just as much as you would us!\n\n_Note: This is for LoL Shoutcasting from my perspective and opinions, not general Esports shoutcasting advice as per your post though there undoubtedly is crossovers_\n\nHope this help.

That's probably a good way to practice to a live audience! With that, have a YouTube account ready to upload to - you might grow a following, and at the very worst it'll be useful for benchmarking how far you go on the journey...what changes and improvements (if any) you make and stuff like that.\n\nWith anything, practice will definitely help. I don't mean to do anyone a dis-service but there's a Heroes of the Storm shoutcaster with a similar name to mine and while he's not a bad commentator or streamer I don't really rate his ability to engage the audience when there's a game in progress.\n\ntwitch.tv/kendricswissh if you want to have a look at him.","replies":[{"poster":"Time Criminal","date":"2018-07-29T04:51:41.914+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I don't have a good enough internet to stream over twitch, but I have been looking into it.
