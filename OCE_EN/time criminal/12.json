I main Sion support, and I just got him level 5, and I&#039;m trying to get him level 6, how would you do that playing a guy that is generally top lane support. I just went 1/9/30 something, and got a B+. I think you need to get lots of CS, and help with towers or stuff like that. So yeah... anyone got any advice on S&#039;s with Sion as support instead of top lane?\r\n\r\n(Also did I put this in the wrong section of the boards?)","replies":[{"poster":"Ingénue","date":"2017-07-02T08:38:21.256+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"If you are playing Sion support, you don't need to get CS. \n\nYou just need to play better than the other players that play sion support. I don't see much of it, however I would assume that Sion supports usually come out with high vision scores, relatively low deaths and a few kills. \n\nKeep at it, you will get there eventually ♥","replies":[{"poster":"Time Criminal","date":"2017-07-03T06:13:44.578+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thanks :)","replies":[]}]}]}
