First of all English is not my native language so hopefully I can tell this thing clearly. Thx for ur understanding. :)\r\n\r\nTonight as usual I was having dinner in front of my computer and usually I will spectate a game from homepage of League of Legend. It started at around 12:05 a.m. in OCE. This game is a rank game but not really attractive as Singed already had 3 kills at top lane, the score was 1 vs 8, as jungler for red team, Niddle got 2 dragons. \r\n\r\nSo I didn&#039;t really pay attention to this game until I found that Sivir in Blue team always solo top or bot to split push. That&#039;s weird because usually it&#039;s a top champion to split push all the time as they always bring teleport. Below is the picture I took at the mid time of the game. Red team had a big advantage but actually they are 4v5!! Although lack of one teammate, they still make this and finally win the game. \r\n \r\nYou may notice that Morgana was AFK all the game from level 1. She should be Ezreal&#039;s support but she takes Smite and leave game from the very start. I suppose red team must have some quarrels when pick position and follow a pick order, Niddle get JG at first then Morgana decided to throw this game. \r\n \r\nHer LOL ID is Dominant Brick1. I really hope players like her should be punished. Here is my suggestion: for players who AFK for the whole game or intentionally feeding in rank game, they will drop one rank rating, for example, from Gold to Silver. Even this may because some technical issues in their home like disconnecting because it is their responsibility to ensure they have a decent network play environment for LOL, especially for rank games. \r\n\r\nYou may respond me that Riot makes a lot of efforts on report system. But when I check this player&#039;s match history, he left a rank game on 11 May, 2015. Today is 12 May. He still played so many games in a row. \r\n\r\n From my own experience, I really appreciate Riot&#039;s report system. I am an old player, playing this game from S1 in China and S3 in NA, S4 and S5 in OCE. AFK is the easiest way to get reported and punished by LOL, but seems not effective enough. Only rely on report by players is not enough. Sometimes even myself dont really bother to click that report button for some bad players who verbally abuse teammates all the time or AFK. \r\n\r\nIt&#039;s late in Sydney now and I have work to do tomorrow. But I rather to spend 1 hour to write this to you cuz I really want to make this game better. Red teams are lucky as they have decent players and never give up, they deserve some rewards (such as more points for winning this game). But for other players? What if they match this player again in rank game? I used to fail 3 promotion from silver to gold because of bad players. They either blame teammates for some mistakes or disconnect for the whole game. I cant even have a normal game like 5v5 (I&#039;m really unlucky especially when play rank game). There was once I played a game 3v5. Me and Talon get 2 penta kills but enemy team simply split push to win, I felt really upset and started a new game. When I finished my second game to check those 2 afk players, they still can play games as normal. Thats when I found report system cant punish everyone with bad behaviors. \r\n At the end, thank you for your patience to read all my complaints 0.0. If a rank game on the homepage even has things like this, you can imagine how common this happens surround us. Sorry for my poor English.\r\nHope you have a nice day.\r\np.s. I cant post photos on this board. how to do it?","replies":[{"poster":"HORSE OF FORCE","date":"2015-05-14T01:34:41.356+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":">Niddle\n\nniddle mah diddle\n\n>from Gold to Silver\n\nWOAH WHAT THE HELL? WHAT ABOUT PEOPLE THAT HAVE TECHNICAL DIFFICULTIES? It's not like you can predict your ISP having a mid-life crisis. And since when does leaving a game actually indicate your apparent skill-level? Sure it's a bad act, but it doesn't mean you're bad at the game. And a whole league, not even division?\n\nAnd not to mention it's a form of exclusion. Not everyone in the world is in the right place or has the right resources to get a pristine and perfect connection to the net. It's just unfair to outright exclude them from aspects of the game.\n\nThe game already actually has punishment in terms of leaving a game. If you leave a game while in promotions, then that game counts as a loss even if your team picked up the ball and won without you. If you leave a game at all, then you are not eligible for LP gains.\n\n>Sometimes even myself dont really bother to click that report button for some bad players who verbally abuse teammates all the time or AFK. \n\nThen why are you suggesting it be changed? It seems like you aren't even bothered by it by doing this.\n\n>I used to fail 3 promotion from silver to gold because of bad players.\n\nThis is a **team game**. If you find one player is performing worse than the others, don't give up and then berate them for their skill level. Instead you can work around that weakness in the game and find a solution that everyone will enjoy.\n\n>When I finished my second game to check those 2 afk players, they still can play games as normal.\n\nThat could just be from the delayed feedback loop. It doesn't indicate that there's anything wrong with the report system.\n\n>p.s. I cant post photos on this board. how to do it?\n\nClick the paper-clip icon adjacent to the \"POST\" button. Then, drag and drop your image file into the window which appears.\n\nThis is more a philosophical debate about punishment and reward than it is about technical issues. It belongs more on the Miscellaneous boards than anything.","replies":[]}]}
