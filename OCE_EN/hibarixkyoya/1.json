The change is that in the first year- year and a half of playing league, when playing ranked, your mmr is moreso determined by placement matches than the mmr of the previous season. Also, if you have not ranked for 3 months since your last ranked game, your mmr increases a little bit. e.g say when you start the game, you have the mmr of a bronze 1, if your mmr is lower than that, it gets increased a little, and if it is higher, it doesn&#039;t get touched. The reason for this proposal is that for a beginner, the first year- year and a half is the most they improve as they come from knowing nothing to being knowledgable and decent at league. Also, as a beginner, many people rank, and most of the time it doesn&#039;t go very well. \r\n\r\nThe example i am going to give is that of myself. In preseason 5 i played 11 ranked games, and won 3, somehow achieving silver 5, right now i am in prelims with 5/3, 2 games of which i played 3 months ago and lost both. since i decided to rank last year, my mmr gets a soft reset and even if i win my last 2 games i will probably get the best of silver 5, which i believe i am capable of achieving higher than. Ranking a lot is annoying though xD as i only rank on weekends.","replies":[]}
