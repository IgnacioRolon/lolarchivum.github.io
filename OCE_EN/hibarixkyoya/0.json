I read a forum in the NA server for the fizz vs zed matchup and most of the people said that it favours fizz while a few people said that it is a skill matchup. I dont understand how it favours fizz as i have had a very hard time playing against zed as fizz. In my experience, I have found it hard to outpoke zed. Zed can spam his w e q pre 6 without being in melee range while i need to w q e or w q him. This is hard to do often as my mana is restricted. At level 6 it continues this way however i cannot use e or zed will ult. that means his poke is much stronger than mine and it is ranged unlike mine. If i attempt to poke him, as i cannot use e to escape safely, he will be able to outrade me as it is easier to land his abilities and he can aa. i tend to find it a little bit difficult to farm against zed, making it hard to rush my well needed zhonyas. I found out via experience that as long as im not much behind the zed ( i only find thsi possible if the jg basically camps) i can 1 v 1 zed only with zhonyas.","replies":[{"poster":"Gary1q2","date":"2014-12-29T23:09:08.564+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"just dodge all of zed's q and e and ur set,\n\nzed cant dodge ur fizz QW cus its not a skill shot\nwhen he ults u just E\ndont use ur E until he ults :D","replies":[{"poster":"Mar3thyu","date":"2014-12-29T23:45:54.095+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Gary1q2,realm=OCE,application-id=FjGAIbRv,discussion-id=ddvhvoTP,comment-id=0001,timestamp=2014-12-29T23:09:08.564+0000)\n>\n> just dodge all of zed's q and e and ur set,\n> \n> zed cant dodge ur fizz QW cus its not a skill shot\n> when he ults u just E\n> dont use ur E until he ults :D\n\nsame with ult cause I believe he can dodge it even if it hits","replies":[]},{"poster":"Hibarixkyoya","date":"2014-12-29T23:45:14.573+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Its not that easy dodging all of his q and e s, i build crystalline flask and cookies but i always use up all of them relatively early, once i decided to be %%%%%%ed and try building dorans shield and it was horrible.

Then E to dodge his skills and get him slowed and W to harass him. Or W him if he refuses to use his skills and then use E to either escape if you're losing the trade or E to keep him from escaping.\n\nAlso if you are past level 6, you can just use your ult on him and he won't be able to do jack%%%%. You'll have him bursted before he can do anything. Fizz ult has a enormous range and if you know your enemies movement pattern somewhat or if you have vision you can land your ult on him under his tower, WQ him and then just jump out. They always feel save under their tower and try to farm minions there and that's a good time to hit em. If you fear Zed just dodging, try shooting the ult from the jungle brush next to the mid tower. Then walk in on him from behind the tower. You will take a shot from the tower but he's dead.\nI don't think you should rush Zhonyas but that's your own beer. I personally prefer to build either RoA first for a stronger teamfight and overall presence (Plus it heals your mana and health which you seem to have problems with...) or I just build Lich Bane straight away which enables me to QWE pretty much anyone instantly (good for roaming, against noobs or squishies imo).","replies":[]},{"poster":"Mar3thyu","date":"2014-12-29T08:47:51.362+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It depends on how you play you can use ult to bait zeds ult e it then he is infront of you (and under tower if u play it right) and you basically win as he will have to retreat or stay there and take tower and your damage","replies":[{"poster":"Raptorzzz","date":"2014-12-30T02:58:27.339+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"if u bait his ult and e to tower and you (the fizz) are winning he could just reselect ult and run..\nif thats what you mean","replies":[]},{"poster":"Hibarixkyoya","date":"2014-12-29T23:47:40.670+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"fair enough, the next time i play against zed i will try that.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"TrashDonnut","date":"2014-12-30T02:58:23.149+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"When he ults, E.\n\nezpz.","replies":[]}]}
