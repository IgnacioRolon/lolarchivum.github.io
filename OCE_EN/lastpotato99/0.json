I have played 3 Games today and they have all been the same. I have been having a couple of ping spikes in the early game but a simple game restart will fix the issue (ping will drop back to normal), but later on in the game, restarting the game wont fix the issue and i am getting and average of 400-500ms.\r\n\r\nDoes anyone have any idea about why this is happening.\r\n\r\nThanks","replies":[{"poster":"SephirothSG","date":"2016-01-30T08:10:47.285+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey there,\n\nCan you run through the [Connection Troubleshooting Guide](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues) and let me know if anything helps.\n\nIf nothing in the above guide helped, please perform the following.\n\n* [Download WinMTR](http://winmtr.net/download-winmtr/).\n* Run a traceroute through WinMTR to the following IP address (Allow this to run for 5-15 minutes).\n\n>103.240.227.5\n\n* Export the results as a textfile and post them _or_ attach a screenshot of your results, whichever is easiest for you.","replies":[{"poster":"lastpotato99","date":"2016-01-30T23:33:24.939+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n|                                      WinMTR statistics                                   |\n|                       Host              -   %  | Sent | Recv | Best | Avrg | Wrst | Last |\n|------------------------------------------------|------|------|------|------|------|------|\n|                            192.168.20.1 -    0 |  311 |  311 |    1 |    2 |   18 |    1 |\n|                   No response from host -  100 |   62 |    0 |    0 |    0 |    0 |    0 |\n|                        as9790.akl-ix.nz -    0 |  311 |  311 |    2 |    5 |   43 |    6 |\n|                        as4826.akl-ix.nz -    0 |  311 |  311 |    3 |    6 |   21 |    4 |\n|ten-0-7-0-1.cor01.alb01.akl.VOCUS.net.nz -    0 |  311 |  311 |   26 |   29 |   72 |   28 |\n|ten-0-3-0-2.cor03.syd03.nsw.VOCUS.net.au -    0 |  311 |  311 |   26 |   29 |   71 |   29 |\n|  ten-1-0-0.bdr03.syd04.nsw.VOCUS.net.au -    0 |  311 |  311 |   26 |   29 |   71 |   31 |\n|as6507.cust.bdr03.syd04.nsw.VOCUS.net.au -    0 |  311 |  311 |   26 |   31 |   72 |   30 |\n|                          104.160.156.35 -    1 |  303 |  301 |   26 |   31 |   74 |   30 |\n|                         104.160.156.103 -    0 |  311 |  311 |   27 |   30 |   70 |   29 |\n|                   No response from host -  100 |   62 |    0 |    0 |    0 |    0 |    0 |\n|                   No response from host -  100 |   62 |    0 |    0 |    0 |    0 |    0 |\n|                   No response from host -  100 |   62 |    0 |    0 |    0 |    0 |    0 |\n|                   No response from host -  100 |   62 |    0 |    0 |    0 |    0 |    0 |\n|                   No response from host -  100 |   62 |    0 |    0 |    0 |    0 |    0 |\n|                   No response from host -  100 |   62 |    0 |    0 |    0 |    0 |    0 |\n|                   No response from host -  100 |   62 |    0 |    0 |    0 |    0 |    0 |\n|                   No response from host -  100 |   62 |    0 |    0 |    0 |    0 |    0 |\n|                   No response from host -  100 |   62 |    0 |    0 |    0 |    0 |    0 |\n|                   No response from host -  100 |   62 |    0 |    0 |    0 |    0 |    0 |\n|                   No response from host -  100 |   62 |    0 |    0 |    0 |    0 |    0 |\n|                   No response from host -  100 |   62 |    0 |    0 |    0 |    0 |    0 |\n|                   No response from host -  100 |   62 |    0 |    0 |    0 |    0 |    0 |\n|                   No response from host -  100 |   62 |    0 |    0 |    0 |    0 |    0 |\n|                   No response from host -  100 |   62 |    0 |    0 |    0 |    0 |    0 |\n|                   No response from host -  100 |   62 |    0 |    0 |    0 |    0 |    0 |\n|                   No response from host -  100 |   62 |    0 |    0 |    0 |    0 |    0 |\n|                   No response from host -  100 |   62 |    0 |    0 |    0 |    0 |    0 |\n|                   No response from host -  100 |   62 |    0 |    0 |    0 |    0 |    0 |\n|                   No response from host -  100 |   62 |    0 |    0 |    0 |    0 |    0 |\n|________________________________________________|______|______|______|______|______|______|\n   WinMTR v0.92 GPL V2 by Appnor MSP - Fully Managed Hosting & Cloud Provider","replies":[{"poster":"SephirothSG","date":"2016-01-31T02:30:27.214+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I don't see any excessive packet loss.
