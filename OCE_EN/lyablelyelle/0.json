Vayne skin Concept","subforum":"Player Creations","embed":{"description":"Night Crawler breaches the White House security in an attempt to kill the president.","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uLOMdddg11A","image":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/uLOMdddg11A/hqdefault.jpg"},"up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Vayne, The Night Hunter. Legendary skin &quot;Nightcrawler Vayne&quot;\n\nA reference for the smoke AND a kick similar to how I has planning her E to go is in the link\n\nMy idea is to create a legendary skin (1820rp) that is perfect for Vaynes kit. As the name implies this skin is based off of the X-men character featured in the movie X-men 2 &quot;Nightcrawler&quot;. Nightcrawlers special attributes is that he teleports to where ever he can see, and I think that this would fit in with Vaynes kit perfectly.\n\nfirst off her character model should feature a dark/navy ish skin color and/or a grayish/blue {{champion:13}} with a long trench coat that stops around her calves I&#039;d say, because she wont have a cape with this skin (it would look too weird). Her crossbow either a dark blue or black color. She should HAVE A TAIL distinctively similar to the character in x-men 2&#039;s tail I&#039;d say her eyes be yellow similar to the arclight skin but not the whole eye just the iris. her clothing should be similar to another character from another movie the female protagonist from the Underworld movies\n\nlegendary/Ultimate (i say either cause this skin will require new animations for her abilities and I&#039;m not sure what category it falls in)\n\nP - Night Hunter \n\nthe default animation for her passive is a small pulsing purple circle at her feet, with this skin it should be reworked to look more like a navy smoke\n\nQ - Tumble\n\nthe default animation being that she dashes a short distance, during this dash, bats fly out from around her. For the skin this fundamentally stays the same except for the smoke from her passive animation is dispelled around her feet (think of how dry ice smoke dissipates) so it kind of looks like she is jumping from her little shadow cloud. Also the animation of this WILL have to be edited/reworked to accompany Vaynes shiny new tail! {{champion:67}} \n\nW - Silver Bolts\n\nher w would be as simple as a recolor to a navy/blue and on the proc of the 3rd strike a small bit of shadow falls over the target (I&#039;d say the shadows be similar to when {{champion:238}}  Zed&#039;s W runs out and his shadow collapses but not so prominent)\n\nE - Condemn\n\nI have 2 ideas for this first and my main idea being instead of using her plain old hand crossbow she kicks into a shadow, towards the end of the animation a shadow appears for a brief moment at the target and they are pushed back (at :40 seconds is the reference to the pushkick BUT Vaynes Character Model doesn't actually move she just kicks her shadow. so like she does a push kick towards them but bridges the gap with her &quot;teleportation&quot;.\n\nthe other idea being a bit more bland, it&#039;s the exact same as her e now just a shadow trails behind the bolt (this isn&#039;t very flashy and just supposed to be a backup idea if the first is too buggy/hard to create)\n\nR - Final Hour\n\nnow... for what should make this skin shine as a legendary. her ultimate skill Final Hour will first of all intensify the smoke from her passive (should look like a dry ice machine at her feet when facing towards an enemy champion and kind of thinned out more like her passive normally but it reaches further out to the range of the star when she ult&#039;s in the other skins when not facing a champion), this smoke could also take on the shape of the star but I don&#039;t think this would flow as well unless it&#039;s fairly blended. second her Q Tumble (this is how I got the idea for the skin in the first place) sends her into stealth BUT instead of the smaller animation around the center of her model it should look like Nightcrawlers Tele animation from the movie (NOTE: her q animation sound is changed to sound more like when the X-man tele&#039;s around beating up the evil doers), This animation for entering stealth is repeated for when she comes out of stealth, Imagine the point in the reference video at about 1:30 when he breaks into the office with the president... that's when vayne hits R and wrecks your team)\n\nfinally her sounds should be updated to match the aesthetic of the skin\n\nthats basically all of it I think this concept would fit in REALLY REALLY well with her kit and I&#039;d personally love to see it in game. Share your thoughts fellow summoners!!\n\n{{champion:67}} {{champion:67}} {{champion:67}} {{champion:67}}","replies":[{"poster":"EzeBlood","date":"2016-03-01T06:03:21.630+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Would be a tough job to animate, but it should get through the copyright tests.
