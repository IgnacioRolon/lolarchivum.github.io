Permanently, i have spent hours and hours, days and years on this game account, played and grinded, iv gotten worn out. worn thin, i got abit salty, placements and you get people that feed on purpose and convince the entire enemy team to report you for being upset about it. of course i swore, i shouldn&#039;t have, absolutely. but i dont think i should be shut down completely. compared to the others that are still out there trumping the system. id like another chance to prove. i have spent anywhere between 500-1000 dollars easily. not that this is a pay to win matter, just because i am serious. anything i can do..? I do not want to be perma banned. i apologize.","replies":[{"poster":"Deep Terror Nami","date":"2016-02-03T06:52:04.350+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey Summoner,\n\nUnfortunately, Riot does not change punishments unless they were done in error. Punishment is typically done in 4 steps;\n\n* 10 game chat restriction\n* 25 game chat restriction\n* 14 day account ban\n* Permanent account ban\n\nExcept in extreme cases such as hate speech and death threats (or consistent gameplay abuse or cheating) they go in order, and it takes 3 months for your tier to drop 1 step. Unless your behavior was similar to one of those extremes, this would've been coming after a 14 day ban and a consistent pattern of toxic behavior. As much as you might dislike it, Riot has no other choice when people show that temporary punishments have no effect on them.\n\nYou are free to create a new account. If you choose to do so, please use this permaban as a learning experience so you can become a more positive player and treat your fellow Summoners with respect, whether they deserve it or not. It's Riot's job to punish them, not yours, so just mute and report. If feel you might be able to contest your ban, you may submit a [Support Ticket](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/requests/new).\n\nGood luck in the future.\n-DTN","replies":[]},{"poster":"Me Dig Stank","date":"2016-02-04T20:54:14.503+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Just make another account bro, whats another grand? :P\n","replies":[]}]}
