What happens is that the client is a separate process to the one which you use to play the game, and the process which patches the game is another. When you go into a game, what's suppose to happen is that the process for the client minimises and the game process takes focus. What is important about this is that the game process can run without the client process running. They use different ports/connections.\n\nIf there is no trace of League once the game ends, then that means the client process was halted for some reason while you were playing. Now, I ask, are you able to leave the client open by itself for an extended duration, say, an hour?","replies":[]}]}
