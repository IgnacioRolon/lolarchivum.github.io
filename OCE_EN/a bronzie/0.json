If 4 different people reported someone for afking, only the report that triggered it would get the notification. I think that's a bit shit.","replies":[{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2018-11-13T08:57:37.561+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Frankly it is pretty shit. The notification is notoriously unreliable and also rather limited. Not getting a notification doesn't mean noone was punished, nor does it mean your report was meaningless. Getting a notification does always mean that someone was punished, so it's a nice little bonus, but it shouldn't be counted on by any stretch.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"6ÍX9ÎNE","date":"2018-11-12T22:10:44.747+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"***","replies":[{"poster":"Mo1st","date":"2018-11-13T00:34:19.482+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"Don't waste your fucking time reporting any more.
