Tanky, had 3 cc abilities, and a potentially game-changing ultimate, even able to almost one combo squishies with a couple tanky AP items. Now however, I feel like she is one of the worst junglers (Kindred aside) for really anything. Need a tank? Hecarim or Zac. Need large cc in a teamfight? Amumu or the other two mentioned. Want an AP jungler? Elise or Evelynn. She has no place in the meta, and hasn&#039;t for quite some time.

Had a look at his kit that passive is fucked.\n\nIt takes way too long to be of any use anywhere. It needs to be lowered to 4 stacks from 5, revive always active or the effect is in combat and not just champs (atleast vs epic monsters like most other champs have), and maybe a 20% bonus ad scale to his w. ðŸ˜‘\n\n","replies":[]}]}]}]}
