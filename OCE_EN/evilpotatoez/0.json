Apart from possibly needing a bit more sustain for your ADC or someone who won&#039;t build lifesteal, I really don&#039;t see the reason to take it over courage, especially when something like {{summoner:14}} will counter it to the point where it&#039;s useless. Anyone have any answers for that?","replies":[{"poster":"Nijel","date":"2017-03-15T01:39:34.846+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"As a diehard melee support player, Stoneborn Pact is the keystone I've been waiting for. \n\nCourage of the Colossus, to me, has always been an initiator keystone. Alistair, Leona and Nautilus are all champs who have cc abilities that require them to enter the fray. The shield it grants allows them to survive that engagement. On these, Courage is probably still the best choice as it's usually more important that they are able to soak up damage rather than offer a heal. Sometimes, these champs might even zone enemy champions which means no one would be in range to heal from them anyway.\n\nBut on someone like Braum, who is **the man** after the change, Stoneborn Pact is the only choice. First off, the passive grants 5% more health which synergises with the health scaling on his Winter's Bite (Q). Second, ally champions will _always_ want to attack targets that have been marked by Winter's Bite or stunned by Concussive Blows. When Braum wants to peel, which should be almost always, the heal allows him to do that even more effectively than before. Very similarly actually, Stoneborn has also blessed Tahm. \n\nSo what I think it comes down to, for supports at least, is whether you want to engage or peel. If you want to engage you want Courage of the Colossus as _you_ are the one who is taking damage. If you want to peel you want Stoneborn Pact as your _teammate_ is the one who is taking damage. Even though it's still early days it's pretty obvious I'm loving Stoneborn so far [especially on Gragas support ; )].","replies":[{"poster":"EvilpotatoeZ","date":"2017-03-15T05:15:47.477+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yeah that's fair enough, I didn't really think about the whole \"engage or peel\" scenario.

The problem with it though is most champions cap out at 100 tops (if building only hp items) and then that only heals over 2 sec, so it ends up being 50 hp per sec, as long as the fight goes, and that doesn't end up being too much in the end.

Karthus no longer becomes worth focusing with this build and yet he still does decent base damage and constantly reapplies the bond of stone in a very large aoe with his e and he also can apply the bond of stone really early on with wall of pain. This reapplies faster than swains passive, which makes the team healing very strong.","replies":[{"poster":"Talon12","date":"2017-03-15T04:04:25.111+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The rune lasts for 4 seconds... swain sends out crows every .25 seconds refreshing the rune once every 1 seconds.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"dragon poo","date":"2017-03-14T13:14:17.825+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Lord Sesshomaru,realm=OCE,application-id=FjGAIbRv,discussion-id=6qFsTlqd,comment-id=0000,timestamp=2017-03-14T12:43:10.114+0000)\n>\n> _(coming from someone who hasn&#x27;t used it yet)_\n> \n> My guess would be that it might be weaker in a lane trade where only 1 person benefits from it, but in a team fight where you mark someone and your whole team heals from it, I think it would clearly outshine Courage.\n> \n> My complaint with it, is its yet another mastery that requires CC to use, so some champs no longer have the option of a tanky-support mastery. _(and the less thunderlords gardens we have running around, the better.)_\n> \n> also from someone who hasn&#x27;t used it (or even seen it) yet.\n> What exactly classes as &quot;movement impairing?&quot;\n> Does that include slows?

TL:DR not as good early, helps late with teamfights","replies":[]}]}]}
