And yeah I have seen some questionable %%%% example of a Katarina Shunpo'ing 4 times in 0.3 seconds, but before I call that %%%% out I simply realize they most likely just spammed QWER and hoped for the best. However, Cassio is a notoriously known scripting champ and I assume that's why she was changed, as she wasn't OP when played legit, scripters just made her broken because speed on Cassio matters. But please, before you /all \"%%%%ING SCRIPTER\" just finish the match and watch the replay.. be warned a lot of people play with macros and from what Riot has said they're not cheating. \n\nHowever, if in the replay they move then do a full 180 and blow you up, yeah cheaters, otherwise if they were running towards you then they may just have quick reflexes. Plus not everyone in Bronze/silver sucks, I know a guy who is Bronze4 and yet he plays like a Diamond, he just cannot carry games as he loses hope to quickly and the focus is gone.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Cakemeisting","date":"2015-02-24T09:40:28.420+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yeah cassiopeia scripts are around (check youtube).","replies":[]}]}
