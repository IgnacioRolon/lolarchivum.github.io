It's a numerical value that's meant to represent your skill by a single variable. MMR could vary from 500 to 2000, usually. When you get matched into a game, the servers match you against people of similar MMR to you, to create a competitive game for all. Since not everyone has the same MMR, there will always be a slightly imbalance in the total MMR one team has to another.\n\nIf you are on the team which has more MMR, then you are considered to be the 'favourite' to win. If you do win, then your LP gains are sligthly reduced to compensate for this. If you're on the underdog side and you win, then your LP gains are slightly increased to compensate.\n\nReally ingenious if you ask me.","replies":[]}]}
