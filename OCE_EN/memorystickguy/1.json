But it seems like 80% of the summoners i played with did not follow the code and i was cringing that entire time because you can see garen going solo bot while lucian solo top, while taliyah stading in base forever, and the jungler won&#039;t gank and a lot a lot of moments.\r\n2. during game it is very important for summoners to work with each other, but no, most games, they do two things, play game and feed or AFK, which both are bad, on top of that, nobody are communicating, even if they do, they are summoners who insult teamates, like me, i was insulted: &quot;you should go back to intro man&quot;, &quot;satan please help these people over here&quot;, &quot;garen players are stupid&quot;, &quot;dude fuck off of my lane&quot;(that was supposed to be my lane) and etc.\r\n3. maybe the solution is, to award additional ip or rp to those who follow the summoners&#039; code, and this is my request, after playing a match with the &quot;code&quot;, award +200 more ip, in long term following the &quot;code&quot; summoners can get rp, how about that?? it&#039;s a good idea right??? i mean without AFK-ing summoners who did not follow the code, you can just instead award more ip and rp to those who really pay so much respect to league of legends(what i said, does not mean to ban AFK, but to not let more people to get AFK)","replies":[{"poster":"Project Xayah","date":"2016-05-22T05:53:48.974+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"> during champion select, we must have one top(fighter or tank), one jungler(any role any champ suitable enough to go with smite), one mid(mages and assassins), and of course adc and sup are bot laners, this is the most most MOST classical way of playing league of legends and it is what every summoner should know.

There is not a way the game *MUST* be played, only a way the community *generally* agrees is *the most effective* way of playing. The META is a player-community created concept and is, in no way, supported by the rules of the game. People can not (and rightfully *should* not) be punished for playing off-META.\n\nWhat *is* part of the summoners code is *communication and team-based strategy*, which is dependant on the *entire* team. If someone wishes to play something off-META it is their responsibility to ensure their team knows that, *however* it is also the responsibility of the team to effectively communicate their intentions as well. If you have an issue with how someone else wants to play you have the right to question it, *however* you *don't* have the right to tell someone they aren't allowed to try something different.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Fitzky","date":"2016-05-22T04:20:47.723+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"1. What your speaking of is called the \"meta\" which was made up by the players not Riot\n2. This is a common issue when 5 random players are put together and are required to work as a team, sometimes it just doesn't work out and arguments occur.\n3. I kinda agree with rewarding players in some way but remember sometimes afks aren't on purpose and its merely their internet messing up or other technical issues so its not always their fault.","replies":[]}]}
