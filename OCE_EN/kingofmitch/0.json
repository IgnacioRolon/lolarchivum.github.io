Ekko on the other hand is much easier and at his current state his kit is a bit overpowered. I find myself getting him on random in aram when he's free and carrying the game heavily despite having very little experience with him at all. I would still buy lee sin if it was me since I actually own him and enjoy playing him time to time. I also get that feeling when I kill someone that it was \"fair\" and not \"I won that fight because my champ is op\" like I get when playing ekko.
