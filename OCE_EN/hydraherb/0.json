So that players are actually matched with similar minded players for better TEAMWORK!!\nexample you don't want to put 3 \"I just want to play the game\" players on a team of 2 \"I try hard I want to win\" type of players and expect a good match outcome.. its not going to happen.. most likely there will be yelling, accusing.. flaming.. some kind of belittlement of a team member because you have 3 players that don't care and are just playing and 2 players that are trying their butts off to win.\nI know the reason some of this may be an issue is because doing this would probably alter the average wait time for a match.. which can be another kind of issue for some players... perhaps as a workaround for this.. have a QuickMatch option to match anyone quickly regardless of personality types ie the normal as it is now que option.. or a Teambuilder que where you are matched with similar minded players for a better gaming experience... taking into account that match times will probably be longer.. perhaps to help avoid some frustration maybe have an online counter showing how many are in que atm for this type of match thingy to better help people decide which que mode to enter.\nThis kind of stuff is constantly happening.. several players have made rant posts about this over the last few years.. and Riot has done nothing that I can see to fix this issue.\nLet's be real here.. most players are casual players.. and while the friends system is nice and sorta a way to address this problem.. it doesn't really do it.. as most are casual they might not play enough to see friends on everytime they play.. so being able to match them with similar random people online would be instrumental in this.\n\nI am asking Riot to consider these things.. and how they can address them to improve the game in a POSITIVE way instead of just trying to last another quarter.","replies":[{"poster":"RIP1TUP","date":"2020-01-27T12:06:00.488+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Riot OCE won't listen to you, they never will. Hence the reason they can go fuck themselves. Best thing to do, which is what i do and encourage every gamer I know, is don't spend money on the game.

Now the game is like a gambling match.\n\nJust don't spend money on the game, you spend money your still supporting them. Playing the game technically your still supporting them, so pretty much lets make another game more popular than league and maybe they'll consider making a effort to help seperate toxic players from people who actually want to play the game","replies":[]},{"poster":"Jockulation","date":"2020-01-26T11:11:47.787+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"People pretty much do whatever they please in LoL.  Unless you're using a trigger word in their automated system, Riot doesn't give a shit.  I've reported players for telling myself or others to kill themselves, being racist and homophobic (with screenshots as evidence) and they're never banned.\n\nPlayers run it down lanes, and quit within 10mins\n\nNothing happens.

You don't like having rude players in your game just fkn mute them. People say they get abused and attacked during their games, like okay bro fkn mute them and you'll forget they ever even typed.\n\nand lets be honest the lower your rank the more toxic bitches your gonna meet because they think they know how to play out a game and always think everyone but them are the ones making mistakes, not saying higher elo doesn't have toxic players but by that point you'll ever have full mute on every game or really learnt too not care about anything rude people say.]\n\nYou bring up pro play how they communicate properly and focus on winning, let me remind you pro player teams are teams brought together to play with each other all the time, they build relationships with each other, they learn each others strengths and weaknesses and have voice coms. Also they are very good players.. Obvs why they in the pro league. You can't expect your normal games where you play with random people you don't for around 20-40 mins to know to communicate and play like pros. Maybe if league brought voice coms it that could make a difference but at the same time I think players would end up choosing to type then speak because everyone are a bunch of pussy's and act tough over text then in voice.\n\n\nIf anything riot should have little warning symbols next to players names for a certain period of time too let other players know that this player is known to have toxic behaviour. They should force us into report system e.g. keeping the normal stuff like good team work, tilt proof and loved playing with them and an button that would be if the player was being toxic. The only issue that comes with that are people who are dicks that will purposely report players as \"rude and toxic\" when they weren't, so then they would have to make it so that after 3-4 game the symbol would show up next to the players name. \n\nAt the end of the day I think its too hard for them to create a system that would track toxic behaviour, I've never played a game that had it. You learn to suck it up and realise its a game and move on.\n","replies":[]},{"poster":"HydraHerb","date":"2020-01-25T14:50:32.769+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I will not be spending another penny on this game or any Riot game until riot addresses and fixes the massive number of toxic players.. my gaming experience is not worth spending money on to justify.","replies":[{"poster":"ThatsBS","date":"2020-02-07T07:02:52.973+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'll be honest, its not really their issue to fix society's personalities through this game, if they are actually inting trolling and/or afking, they will eventually get punished, just like criminals do in society. Yes some will slip through the cracks and never be punished, but the majority will. \nThey are all like cards, you can't chose them. you just have to deal with it. \nI know it sucks, but its way to hard to police anymore then they already are. It's anecdotally the most popular game out! So its going to be one of the hardest to police with the player base. \nIf that is too much to bear, maybe team based games may not be for you. I'v been playing this for ten year and suck at the game, but that doesn't mean I don't enjoy it. I love the competition.
