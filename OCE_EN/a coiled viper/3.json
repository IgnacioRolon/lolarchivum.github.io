I know i can see mine at the top of the screen but i cant see anyone else either in the scoreboard in game or at the end game lobby. Is this the same for everyone or is my client being weird? Or do i have to push another button to bring up the scores? Would make honoring a bit easier if i knew who the major contributors were.\r\n\r\nthanks","replies":[]}
