We are flexible in what days we play, however it is irregular until we have a set day or two. If you are on every night like half of the team is we want you! We are an average of Gold rank together and bronze 1 straight out of placements, we will climb with the aim learning and getting better individually and as a team. It is essential to add either me or ColdBlood or even both and then message us, we cant keep track of everyone. It is also essential to have a working headset and Curse Voice. \n\nI am aware this is my third or so ad on these boards with numerous people adding me for a select role. Note that i can only accept two people however will talk to all that add me, rank does not essentially matter only your availability. Thank you for your time.","replies":[{"poster":"XxSneakyBeakyxX","date":"2015-11-24T15:39:04.903+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Support main, can play any support champ/style. \n\n20 y/o just finished uni so I will have alot of free time this year to smash out league whenever possible.
