If that fails them they will 1 v 2 and course more problems. \r\nThese fights are unnecessary you may as well toss a coin for the win. \r\nIs it too much to ask for you to wait until we catch a enemy on a ward and collapse them. \r\nYou know make calculated risks.  You know made a proactive play that isnt a heads and tails coin toss. \r\n\r\nYou are not playing Call of Duty.","replies":[{"poster":"RonyStark","date":"2019-10-28T01:58:09.288+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"As a fellow jungler main, I completely agree with your post.\n\nI make this a challenge for myself. How can I carry this type of people whose common sense is not common?\nThen I managed to learn that and started carrying 1v9.\n\nI see you are in bronze. I am from silver-gold area. Just an FYI, it is kinda the same here, although less frequent.\nMost games feel like 1v9 here.\n\nAlso since I am going to reach gold this week, to celebrate it if you want I can teach you how to play your second main champ including how to deal with braindead laner teammates as you mention above, which should be more than enough to bring you up to silver.\n\nAdd me in game.","replies":[{"poster":"GOTANYCHICKEN198","date":"2019-11-12T01:52:10.081+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I know silver is the same.

For some people they live their life the same way.\nOr even worse, everything is just a pi**ing contest. Who has the biggest ego type of mentality. I know it sounds primitive but if you think about it, league of legends more than likely has a very wide demographic of males at all ranks from different cultures. That in itself means more egos and more males trying to better one another.\n\nLeague would also more than likely be majority of 21 and under age group. This being the case you can be certain that most players are not yet mature or developed enough to think in to the future. A recent study by a well renowned university found that adults don't properly develop the parts of the brain to think in to the future until 26. I was a mature teenager and I also found this to be true for myself in many ways. So having said all that, league is generally, \"monkey see, monkey do\". \n\nMost league games need a \"leader\". Not that everyone is going to listen but if that's the case then you should group you're team and follow the \"egotistical\" carry who doesn't want to listen. Then that way you are grouped and if that player is fed then protecting them should be priority anyway. If they aren't fed or aren't as relevant then use them as a distraction. Get the rest of the team to group with u, wait for them to jump in and pick a fight, when the enemy team goes in to help kill the \"distraction\" then you back door the base or push.\nEvery problem has it's solution, sometimes you just need to think outside the box and turn your disadvantage into an advantage. That literally could be the difference between a win or loss in many games.","replies":[]}]}
