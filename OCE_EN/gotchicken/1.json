We won the fight and the game but that doesnt mean anything could of been luck. \n\nIs this the way i should be fighting or should i be targeting the enemy adc.","replies":[{"poster":"Socon","date":"2019-05-08T13:01:22.047+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Adc's should never sacrifice their position to go for carries, thats an assasins job. Adcs are there to put out pure dps, attack anyone in your range and stay in a safe position. By the sounds of it you played it pretty well. Obviously if there are two targets close by that you can attack, attack the least tanky.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2019-05-08T10:35:15.856+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I won't pretend to be a gameplay expert but I'll do my best.\n\nA key skill for being successful in League is **adaptability**, and one of the key skills for ADC is **positioning** (it's relevant to all roles, but particularly so for ADC and assassins). Team-fights can get messy fast, so both of these things become that much more crucial. \n\nAs an ADC your function at its core is purely damage, be that to enemies or objectives, so in team-fights, **the most important thing is that you are dealing damage.**\n\nAlso very important but **secondary, is surviving as long as possible** because if you're dead you can't deal damage. This takes some juggling because if you sit too far back you won't be dealing any damage (and therefore not fulfilling your purpose), but if you go too deep you'll die early and also not deal your damage.\n\n* This juggling largely comes down to experience, both in general and on a particular champion. The deeper your understanding of your strengths and weaknesses (farm, build, counters, individual champions, levels, buffs etc) the easier this process will be.\n\n* There is also the macro to consider, if you don't participate in a given fight, or dip out earlier than you strictly have to, but that means you can save important objectives, then that's the way to go. On the other hand, ADCs and especially Ashe tend to be vulnerable without their team, so it's a very risky option to take.\n\n***Then* comes targeting**. As a whole yes, your team should be targeting the enemy carries (whatever position they happen to fill), but the prioritising is a bit more complicated than that. \n\n* The Vlad Mid may be more dangerous than the MF ADC, but the MF ADC is more vulnerable and can be killed much faster, so cutting her damage may be your best option.\n\n* The tank is generally not who you want to be targeting, but if he's charging in, and the rest of their team is zoned/out of position and not in your range, then you should 100% be hitting the tank rather than no-one, or pushing too deep and getting dead.\n\nFor Ashe in particular, remember that her DPS tends to be lower than other ADCs, particularly hyper carries like Vayne or Kai'Sa, but she has built in kite, is well suited to AoE sustained damage (Runaan's) and is the only ADC with a non-conditional stun (i.e it doesn't need a wall to function).\n\nAll of this needs to come into consideration in team-fights, and it sounds like you did a pretty good job. \n\nMy final tip would be to not forget about vision. If you're fighting next to a blind wall, it's so easy for an enemy to just pop you from safety, so you have to be careful of vision and blind spots when positioning.","replies":[]}]}
