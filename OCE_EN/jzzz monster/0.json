That was one of the biggest challenges of my life. The frustration really got brought out a bit but I tried to keep calm also I would like to share how I got out. \r\n\r\n1. Pick two roles.\r\n2. Pick 6-8 champions from those two roles.\r\n3. Practice and learn everything about those champions. (match ups, escape cool downs, mechanics. Etc.)\r\n4. Map awareness\r\n5. Ward\r\n6. Try to calm the team mates down if they are starting to get on each others nerves.\r\n7. Watch LCS, pros, streams, YouTube, twitch Just study\r\n8. Champ select is more exhausting than the game but try to minimise it don't be toxic just give the babies their lane haha\r\n9. Mute all chat, you dont need to communicate with them and they also try to get on your nerves by saying stuff that will put you off task\r\n10. Watch lastshadow9 he does records himself coaching other people which are really helpful\r\n11. Just have fun remember it's a game you will get out you just need to persist. One thing that I have learnt in life is that if you really want something and you put in the hard yards and keep trying you will get there. Think about it if everything in life was easy there wouldn't be a reason to exist, there would be no challenge. Just like in league of legends if it was that easy everyone would be in diamond. \r\n\r\nCheers, The Jizz meister","replies":[{"poster":"Sackboy","date":"2014-12-02T06:16:32.616+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":13,"body":"1.
