I went 5/5/6, 134cs and 12k gold over 47 minutes. Not too flash hey? Well I was awarded 1432 &lsquo;Champion Points&rsquo; for the win, bumping Fiddle almost all the way up to Level 2 in my first game! \r\n\r\n* My second game was with Yorick supporting. I went 4/4/10, 103cs and 10.8k gold over 40 minutes. Despite losing, I was expecting to be showered in glorious Champion Points, but only received around 250 - about a sixth of what I was awarded for my previous game.\r\n\r\n* My third game was with Yorick top. I went 8/0/11, 273cs and 15.6k gold over 41 minutes. This was remarkably better than both of my last games so even though we lost again, I was expecting lots of Champion Points, but again received only around 250. \r\n\r\n_&ldquo;It&rsquo;s based on the champion and role that you just played in a game. So, for example, we look at Annie mid differently to Annie support. We take a series of performance metrics and compare how you do to all other players in your region in your champion / position combination. It is percentile driven - so earning a high score means you performed in the top x% of players on that champ in that position. The grade itself governs the point gains.&rdquo;_\r\n-http://na.leagueoflegends.com/en/page/features/champion-mastery\r\n\r\nThe results still didn&rsquo;t make sense, so I checked a reputable third-party site which displays a performance indicator that evaluates my results with a specific champion relative to the &lsquo;average player&rsquo; in my region. \r\n\r\nIn game 1 (Fiddlesticks) I performed +17.5% better than the average player in my region.\r\nIn game 2 (Yorick) I performed +8.5% better than the average player in my region.\r\nIn game 3 (Yorick) I performed +166.5% better than the average player in my region.\r\n\r\nThere was a lot of variance in my individual performance across these games, but no statistically significant correlation between my results and the points I received. I received a C+ grade in my first game and an S grade in my second and third games. Despite performing better in the games we lost, my points appeared to be capped at the 250 mark.\r\n\r\nConsider the ~1200 point difference between (8/0/11, loss, S grade) and (5/5/6, win, C+ grade) and you see my problem.\r\n\r\nThe system purports to represent individual &lsquo;mastery&rsquo; of a Champion but it considers what is arguably the most ambiguous factor (game outcome) above personal statistics - so much so that the difference between high and low individual performance (in the event of a loss) is negligible. I respect that this feature provides an exciting new outlet for current players, but I guess I am a little disappointed that it doesn&rsquo;t make any new ground or examine performance to the depth that it implies.\r\n\r\n\r\nRooksy","replies":[{"poster":"Rooksy","date":"2015-05-07T12:49:01.302+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thanks for the comments guys, I think the way that this system is currently implemented is actually quite counterproductive: While a system that rewards individual performance would see a lot of losing games 'bounce back' as players focus on their own performance I think that capping the points of the losing team (particularly so low) actually promotes poorer quality gameplay and will result in more undesirable behaviour when it becomes clear that one team are starting to lose.","replies":[{"poster":"Ediwir","date":"2015-05-08T03:25:09.670+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Technically, it sounds to me quite the opposite. If the aim of the game becomes \"having a high score\" there's thousands of ways to obtain that without going for the nexus.\nBut if you're rewarded for making your team win, well... You have to make your team win.\n\nI guess they just don't want people to focus on their own performance so much that they end up losing sight of the game objective.\nOr, they consider the game objective part of what should be in your performance. Which make sense (you don't play well by losing).\n\nStill, 200-1400 variation... that's pretty huge.","replies":[{"poster":"Rooksy","date":"2015-05-08T10:44:05.636+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"If you take the variation in my results and work up from it, it’s possible the champ mastery system may work as advertised when your team wins, though it’s hard to prove this without more than one win to compare. \n\nHowever the fact that losses are capped suggests that when you lose, the system barely considers your ‘true’ individual performance at all - instead using the overall outcome of the game (which is the performance of five players) to define your individual performance, irrespective of statistics. \n\nThe point I’m making, is that when a game starts going badly the potential loss for players who are doing well increases exponentially as your ‘individual performance’ reward may be compromised by the poor performance of your teammates. \n\nThis provides increased scope for trolls or undesirable players to frustrate their teammates, or new cause for teams to flame under-performing players. This should not happen as a result of a system that claims to measure individual performance..","replies":[{"poster":"AnArtillerySpec","date":"2015-05-10T02:16:32.792+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Good point, also a reason to toxic game play is stats being introduced...so being punished so heavily for a loss isn't beneficial, as stated above, trolls can screw you up, therefore promoting even more aggro in the game...was this system really thought through???

Another game I play well is Wot, that shows a colour/skill system that has a skill vs stats based system.   Basically \"Red\" or \"Tomatoes\" are players that don't play well and effectively don't contribute to your teams effectiveness/win, therefore aren't efficient players.   Where as The Blue/Purples (Also named blunicums/unicums) have high stats because they do alot in the game trying to help your team win.   Now these players also have the 60-80% win ratio's because they contribute to your teams success.   As you state that players can get a good efficiency without pushing the nexus...well just by being efficient, they accidentally push your team to the victory.....as a flip side to that, it's a team game...why should 1 highly efficient player with 4 scrubs be penalised for losing if they did all that could be done to win???   At least Wot's WN8 system reflects the effort put in to win regardless of the outcome.   Hopefully with time and feedback, this rating system comes out with a true reflection of a players skill.   Wot's WN system is in it's 8th set and has finally balanced out to truly reflect a players gaming ability, win or lose, if you work hard,  you deserve rewards or it being shown.","replies":[{"poster":"Ediwir","date":"2015-05-10T07:19:56.077+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I don't play World of Tanks so i can't really compare. I did a quick check on game modes however - it seems it's possible to win by killing, something that in League is impossible.\nIn a system that determines victory by killing, tracking damage is actually a way of determining who contributed most, but in League it's base-only, so how else would you determine who contributed more to the objective of destroying the enemy base?\nTracking inhibitor damage?\n\nSo far i've noticed differences based on time spent dead, some very minor differences for KDA (_VERY_ minor), but 80-85% of the score seems to be win/lose based.","replies":[{"poster":"AnArtillerySpec","date":"2015-05-12T04:58:41.623+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"in WOT its actually similar in many ways.   How the WN system works is, it's alot to do by close proximity damage vs long range, done to enemies.  Then by base defense points (resetting the enemy that is capturing your base, a win alternative), then capture points, kills, spotting damage (as your spotting a enemy allows your team to make shots out of view range) then finally the small boost for win.   So there is a possible way to incorporate similar effects here, since kills are a huge way to win, (or \"Being fed\" wouldn't be a term that causes so much concern.) and damage done (for those that do all but the kill and have it ks'd...lol), assists, and \"structure damage\", cs etc etc.   The game records these stats in match history, so it can be used to show your efficiency.   It would just take a while to get a balance to show a fair grouping/rating.  For WN rating it took the players actually with debate and explanation, turned the \"Ratings\" into a way better balance.   Just like all you highly experienced players could do here.","replies":[{"poster":"Ediwir","date":"2015-05-12T11:47:50.866+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Found more.\nPerformance is not measured among the 10 players in the game, but among all players in the server using that champion.","replies":[{"poster":"AnArtillerySpec","date":"2015-05-13T06:13:56.208+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Ok so its a comparison...cool, they have that in tanks too.  With marks on the tanks barrels to show your skill with that tank  vs the server.   Cool and ty.
