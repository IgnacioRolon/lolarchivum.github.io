Ashe wasn&#039;t sure what that meant exactly, but it did mean everyone was a little more at ease without having to deal with Trynd&#039;s occasional unexplained fits of rage.\r\n\r\n{{champion:22}} Ashe scrunched up her nose at the faint noxious smell odour travelling through the air.  From the corner of her eye, she noticed Bale tense up immediately, his eyes darting from her to the door behind him.\r\n\r\n&quot;I thought you said the sewer problem had been dealt with?&quot;  Ashe said questioningly, looking at her nervous butler.\r\n\r\nBale was a young lanky man who had been in service of Ashe since her coronation as Queen of Freljord. \r\n \r\n&quot;Apologies... My lady, it seems to be taking a bit longer than we expected...&quot; Bale replied hesitantly.\r\n\r\n&quot;How so?&quot; Ashe asked.\r\n\r\n&quot;We are still having trouble locating where the blockage is, and {{champion:29}} Master Twitch has still not returned after we hired him to investigate the source.&quot;\r\n\r\n_Well that was no surprise. That rat had a habit of disappearing into thin air. _   \r\n\r\nAshe raised an eyebrow and looked quizzingly at her butler.  It was a normal characteristic for Avarosans to be rather pale in complexion due to the limited sunlight, but today Bale looked like a shade of white that only Diana could rival.  Ashe couldn&#039;t help but smile when she realised what was making Bale uncomfortable.  Ever since {{champion:127}} Lissandra had taken an interest in Bale, he had become increasingly nervous in her presence.  After all, there was always something not quite human about Lissandra.\r\n\r\n&quot;Is Lissandra coming today?&quot; Ashe asked.\r\n\r\n&quot;Yes, my Lady&quot; Bale answered swiftly.\r\n\r\n&quot;I have some letters I need sent and also {{champion:44}} Tarric asked for a selection gems from the Ironspike Mountains,&quot; said Ashe, &quot;could you see to that please?&quot;  \r\n\r\n&quot;Yes certainly, I will see to it myself!&quot;  Bale said, nodding eagerly.\r\n\r\nAshe shook her head as Bale scampered out of the room.  She leaned back into her chair, and stared at the pile of papers in front of her.  Her whole life she had grown up fighting, relying on her archery skills and strength as a leader to unite Freljord, but now that she had finally gotten somewhere, she had to learn different skills.  Somehow, she thought it would be easier to fight an entire army, than read through the pile of papers regarding various operations in her kingdom.\r\n\r\n&gt; &quot;Dearest Queen Ashe,\r\n&gt; \r\n&gt; The villages to the north have been experiencing dramatic shortages to their food supply in the last few months.  Edible plants and berries have become scarce in the nearby forest.  Livestock numbers have dwindled as areas for grazing has dramatically diminished.  Villagers report that a large portion of the forest is almost devoid of all plant life.  It is estimated that food reserves will only feed the nearby villagers for another month before the situation turns dire.\r\n&gt;\r\n&gt;  The sudden lapse of food seems to be attributable to the recent surge in {{summoner:31}}  Poro population.  Ever since {{champion:201}}  Braum&#039;s establishment of the PPP (Poro Protection Plan), news of the campaign has travelled throughout Freljord and has been received with increasing popularity.  Poros are now bolder than ever, and frequently known to be openly seen in the forest, without fear of humans approaching.  Though they do not pose a direct threat to the villagers, their competition for already scarce food is taking its toll on the villagers.\r\n&gt;\r\n&gt; P.S. One of the poros appears to have taken an interest in Willump, he followed us all the way to the Palace.\r\n&gt;\r\n&gt; Your humble servant and friend,\r\n&gt;\r\n&gt;{{champion:20}}  Nunu&quot;\r\n\r\nOnce the fearsome Ashe, now reduced to dealing with poro overpopulation.  \r\n\r\nA knock on the door interrupted Ashe&#039;s thoughts, and Bale entered announcing, &quot;{{champion:127}} Princess Lissandra has arrived.&quot;\r\n\r\nAshe stood from her chair and proceeded through the long corridor to the drawing room with Bale closely following behind her.  \r\n\r\n&quot;My dear Ashe, it&#039;s good to see you&quot;, the lady in front of her practically glided across the floor towards her as Ashe entered the room.\r\n\r\n&quot;Ah Lissandra, you are always welcome here&quot; Ashe said, leaning in for an embrace.  She felt a shiver crawl up her spine as Lissandra&#039;s icy cold hands touched her skin.  She could have sworn the temperature in the room had suddenly gotten cooler.\r\n\r\n&quot;It isn&#039;t frequent that we get to spend time alone these days,&quot; Lissandra said making herself comfortable in her chair, &quot;with you being married and all.&quot;\r\n\r\n&quot;Aren&#039;t you the same, the trolls in the north have been keeping you busy have they not?&quot; replied Ashe casually.\r\n\r\nLissandra let out a laugh, &quot;not busy enough to come visit you, and your dear butler.&quot; \r\n\r\nAshe watched as Lissandra&#039;s piercing gaze fell upon Bale, who started to shake a little.\r\n\r\n&quot;Please excuse me, I must go into town now... to attend to your duties, my Queen!&quot; Bale said with a slight tremour in his voice.  He dashed out of the room.\r\n\r\nThe sound of the two women laughing soon resonated from the room.  In that moment, they were not two leaders in a divided land, but just two friends enjoying a joke.\r\n\r\nA loud bang suddenly errupted from below.   Numerous shouts could be faintly heard and the two women quickly made their way downstairs to investigate the commotion.  They followed the sound into the basement.  As Ashe opened the door, a strong odour assaulted her nostrils.  Several servants stood frozen with various weaponised household items in their hands.\r\n\r\n&quot;What is going on...&quot; said Ashe.  Then she saw the culprit.  A fluffy white ball with a large red tongue scampered around the room happily.  It froze for a moment, seemingly unfazed by the numerous sets of eyes glaring at it with malicious intent.\r\n\r\n&quot;A {{summoner:31}} poro?&quot; Lissandra said questioningly.\r\n\r\n&quot;My queen, we found it down here, it seems to have been attracted by the uh... smell...&quot; a servant said.\r\n\r\n&quot;How predictable, &quot; Lissandra said rolling her eyes, &quot;I really don&#039;t understand what people see in these creatures.  Did you know that {{champion:117}} Lulu got a poro outfit commissioned for pix?  Even {{champion:1}} Annie looked jealous, and you know how proud she is of Tibbers&#039; panda outfit.&quot;\r\n\r\n&quot;Is that so?&quot; Ashe said, thoughtfully.\r\n\r\n&quot;Yes, they are practically the new craze.&quot; Lissandra answered. \r\n\r\n&quot;Lady Ashe, we will have this poro removed immediately...&quot; the servant said nervously.\r\n\r\nAshe looked intently at the poro, who was now highly distracted, sniffing around on the room.\r\n\r\n&quot;No, keep him there,&quot; Ashe said, &quot;I have a plan.&quot;\r\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n&quot;Is everything ready  Bale?&quot; Ashe asked.\r\n\r\n&quot;Yes my Lady&quot; Bale bowed.  Bale clapped his hands and all the doors and windows of the palace swung open.\r\n\r\nIn the distance, Ashe could see the gates of the city wall.  She watched and waited.  A tiny white speck appeared through the gates, initially seemed distracted by the vastness of the city.  Then it started making its way inside.  Slowly, it was followed by a few more specks.  It wasn&#039;t long before {{summoner:31}}  poros filled the city gates, and started rapidly approaching the frozen lake that was around the palace.  They flooded through the palace gates, following the scent in the air.   When there was enough of them in the palace, Ashe ordered the doors closed. \r\n\r\n&quot;My Lady, you were correct, they led us straight to the sewer blockage&quot; Bale said, a wide smile on his face.  &quot;But how did you know the smell would attract them from so far away?&quot;\r\n\r\n&quot;I had a little extra help&quot; Ashe replied.  She had promised {{champion:40}} Janna she&#039;d shoot the next seedy male who starred at her too long.  In return, Janna had send a gust of wind out of the city.\r\n\r\n&quot;I see... But how will we get them out now?&quot; Bale asked.\r\n\r\n&quot;There&#039;s no need, I have a use for them,&quot; said Ashe.\r\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n{{champion:117}} Lulu danced through the bustling streets of an Ionian market place.  Her faerie, Pix, following closely behind.  Onlookers keeping a close yet, not too close distance to the yordle witch.  Lulu seemed unconcerned by the extra attention. \r\n\r\n&quot;Poros for sale!  Direct from Freljord!&quot; A sign read.  The yordle looked intently at the dozen of happy eager eyes with large red tongues staring at her from within the cage.  \r\n\r\n&quot;What a great idea, Pix!&quot; Lulu exclaimed.  She proceeded to barter with the friendly shopkeeper for her prize. \r\n \r\nAn energetic ball of fluff happily leapt at its new owner.  Lulu wrinkled her nose, as the {{summoner:31}}  poro approached her.\r\n\r\n&quot;I know what you need&quot; Lulu said, waving her magical staff.  \r\n\r\n&quot;Adoribus!&quot; Lulu commanded.  The air instantly filled with the smell of cupcakes.\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n&quot;Dearest Queen Ashe\r\n\r\nThe forests are regenerating, and food will soon become abundant again.  In the meantime, money raised from {{summoner:31}} poro sales is being used to provide food for the villagers.  It won&#039;t be long before every household in Valoran has a poro!\r\n\r\n{{champion:20}} Nunu.&quot;\r\n\r\nAshe smiled reading the letter in her hands.  Maybe she wasn&#039;t so bad at this after all.","replies":[{"poster":"Auras1","date":"2016-07-10T11:01:37.213+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The light heartiness?
