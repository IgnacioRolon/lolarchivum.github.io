Both at 1920 x 1080\n60Hz and the other is 70Hz\n\nSo I want to game at higher Fps.\nI have Vsync and Antialiasing on. I have tried turning them off in the past and running the game uncapped.\n\nI don&#039;t know anything about overclocking so I rather not go there just yet.\n\nTho the issues I run into are firstly there is like a horizontal line that appears every time I move my mouse to reposition my screen for my character.\nSecondly my character jumps short distances like its teleporting.\nPlus the game-play doesn't look as smooth.\n\nAnyway I can game at higher fps with my specs without running into those issues?","replies":[{"poster":"BarryButcher","date":"2016-10-06T09:48:19.711+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"you can turn off the vsync and stuff and just cap it at 144 fps and see if its better.","replies":[{"poster":"EMP Implosion","date":"2016-10-06T12:33:42.316+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Ah yea thats better but it doesnt look as smooth as some other peoples gameplay","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"A steezy Scizor","date":"2016-10-06T07:39:23.152+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"yes, you can. I have a 970 and back when i played league i was constantly getting 300+ fps on max settings without overclocking. even with my old gtx 460 I was getting 100+ fps easily.\n\nturn vsync off. it's useless. it puts more of a burden on your gpu. what it does is sync up your game with the refresh rate of your monitor, basically railroading it into the refresh rate of your monitor. the horizontal lines are cause of vsync.\n\nalso, make sure you have your monitor enable for higher framerates. I got a 144hz acer monitor recently and had to enable 144hz mode, as it's not enable by default.\n\nbut yes, your specs are overkill for a higher fps. league is incredibly well optimised and can run on even the shittest of toasters.","replies":[{"poster":"EMP Implosion","date":"2016-10-06T12:33:20.092+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Okay so i disabled vsync and I am at 150 fps fluctuating tho the issue is still there where if i reposition screen there is that horizontal line through the screen.
