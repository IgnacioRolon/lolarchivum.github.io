Even though he goes to their owner \"I will coach your team\" but really behind their back tell the players suck up to me and I will put u in ocs. LULOMAGUD!!! No thanks I would never want to join such a shady team that has a coach who works like that.","replies":[{"poster":"EMP Implosion","date":"2018-12-01T10:32:45.780+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"This is the first I have heard of this, however, it is common for a coach to work with other amateur teams in the offseason. We are happy to launch an internal investigation if you are able to provide any supporting evidence in accordance with the claim. We do pride ourselves with the hard work and integrity as a brand so we take claims like this seriously. \nIn terms of why we put the application here is due to the newer talent pool of players are still rising through the ranks and we want to let them know we are an avenue to explore. Although we do understand the frustration of amateur teams losing players to teams in a higher league as we do lose our players to the OPL teams after every split. This, unfortunately, is a common feat as players wish to progress further in their career and progressing through the league does help them build a reputation.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"SOOM","date":"2018-11-17T02:02:47.376+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":" ","replies":[{"poster":"EMP Implosion","date":"2018-11-17T02:07:22.739+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hello Mystic are you able to access the website now?","replies":[{"poster":"SOOM","date":"2018-11-17T07:03:04.686+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Nah\n\nNot Found\n\nThe requested URL /ocsrecruitment/ was not found on this server.\n\nAdditionally, a 404 Not Found error was encountered while trying to use an ErrorDocument to handle the request.","replies":[{"poster":"EMP Implosion","date":"2018-11-17T09:38:34.827+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Here is a link to our website:\nhttp://www.emproxgg.com/\nYou should be able to access the application near the bottom of the home homepage.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}
