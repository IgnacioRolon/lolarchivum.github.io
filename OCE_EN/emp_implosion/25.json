Also i know a couple of friends of mine that recently picked up this game but not long after quit as it was taking fairly long to level.\n\nI know there is like a beginner, amateur  and expert selection when you create and account but i dnt know what the significance of that is. Basically I want to propose a couple of things.\nFirstly i would like to propose some incentive, i mean yes you get those cool banner for great leader, honorable opponent and  Teamwork but they only provide support for people to abide by the summoner code. They are not in any way helping to improve the game play for people new to the game to get better (you can have nicest and friendliest people in the world but that doesnt mean your going to win your game, they need improvement in skill). Same goes for the ip boost, i mean really come on, everyone knows that you dnt buy runes till you unlock the tier 3 runes and when you have free week champions who needs to buy champions. \n\nI couple of things i would like to propose are firstly the xp boost, as much as i know how much riot wants to make profits i mean come one your pretty much saying here you are bad buy xp boost so you level quicker and reach 30 to play rank and be bronze 5 forever (not always the case but most of the time its true) wouldnt it be better to get them to level 30 than let them buy skins for champions which cost more than what xp boosts do.\nPersonally i believe they should make xp boost a milestone or set them for after a certain wins. So for example if i was playing on a low level account and I just won 10 games in a row right, than a message comes up well done summoner your on a massive win streak and for having a perfect match history you will now receive a 4 game xp boost. The reward of xp boost was due to me  performing and putting an effort into not loosing any of my games that gives the summoner incentive to keep doing well as if you win your xp received from the boost will be greater than if you lose. After the xp boost is used up the counter goes back to zero and than they have to win 10 games in a row to get the next 4 game boost. Now you can not always win 10 games in a row so people will try to perform and improve their skills to level up quicker (also only for normal games not bot games). For people just playing for fun they would not care about these boost and play the game as they like but for people who want to level up they will play better to get these boosts.\n\nThis will than say to the people for all you already lvl 30 people out there as well as new comers you dnt need to buy accounts cause its easier to level up low level accounts now due to the xp boost at after certain win streaks. As riot is against account sales this might be a way to help them around it. I mean it takes 3 months for an average person to lvel an account from 1 to 30 and do you want majority of your summoners to be below lvl 30. this could also mean they would increase the ranked community as more and more people will be reaching lvl 30 so the number of people on the server would increase. Meaning i will not have to contemplate buying a level 30 account as I would able to level my own lower level accounts. \n\nLastly why do i have more than 1 account well sometimes when your on a massive lose streak you tend to want to play on a different account sorta like a fresh start.  It helps you play better as no one knows how badly you performed or you just put it behind you and play the best you can. I jump accounts when im doing bad and i tend to do good on the account and come back to do good on the original account.  I dnt know if that helps you understand.","replies":[{"poster":"Legends man1","date":"2015-06-25T07:25:44.148+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The idea of a winstreak giving you benefits like xp and ip boosts are actually pretty interesting. I dont think they'd ever be implemented though because they'd keep players from buying xp boosts and ip boosts from the shop. But honestly, I'd love to see it happen.","replies":[{"poster":"Ediwir","date":"2015-06-25T07:34:09.313+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'd just want to see an IP/XP boost revamp. Like, make it a proper value, call it \"Boost\" and make it so that if you're not lv30 it ALSO doubles your xp. Say, enough to make it comparable to RP. Not better, but comparable enough that it's not a ripoff.\nRight now it's worth nothing to buy an IP boost unless you're also having XP boost (as buying XP boost means you reach 30 with less IP).","replies":[{"poster":"EMP Implosion","date":"2015-06-25T08:11:56.900+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"yea tho ip doesnt really bother me much really i barely even had runes and i made it to diamond , i cnt make it to challenger but still comes down to my skill and understanding of the game than having champions and runes plus i only played like two one champ and had a back up champ","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"EMP Implosion","date":"2015-06-25T08:09:58.094+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"same i mean incentive in a mindless game keeps it alive, and their goal is play ranked right, it like letting the worthy excel and unworthy take the learning cuve","replies":[]}]}]}
