Over the past split I have been watching OPL I have spotted a few things from a design perspective that I feel I could give some feedback on to help improve the quality of the OPL. With that in mind I have decided to note on quite a few different things that could be improved on I have split it up into different sections. Firstly I will be going over some things that could be done on the website, then I will be going over some things I have noticed that could be done on the youtube channel.\r\n\r\n**The Website - Team Pages.**\r\n\r\nOverall with the design aesthetic of the website I am very happy, I think it does a brilliant job of capturing what the OPL is, but I think that there are a few things as far as certain pages go that could be improved on. The main thing I would like to note on is the individual team pages. Currently to be able to get information on each team and each respective player on said teams you have to go to the standings page and then click on the icon of the team that you wish to know more about. I think that this is a very big opportunity for the website to bring more viewers in if there was a teams page shortcut in the top bar for people to learn more about their favorite players or for new viewers to learn about each individual team.\r\n\r\nOn the team pages themselves though there are a few things that may need to be updated if this was going to be a main page in the website. The first of which is the main image of the roster of players. Though I understand it&#039;s probably very hard to get all the players in to get up to date photos and such of all the players the main thing I want to point out with this is the size of each group when you compare it to the other teams. For example if you look at Chief&rsquo;s line up picture all of them don&rsquo;t really fill up much of the page, but if you go to Sin Gaming&rsquo;s line up you notice that all of the images are a lot more zoomed in, bigger and fill more of the page. I feel if there was a bit more of a consistency with the line up images, it would go a long way to making the pages fit into one concurrent style. (Quick side note with the Dire Wolves line up on the left side there is this tiny little light grey line that you can barely see that is there.)\r\n\r\nAnother small thing with the player lineup images is that for a few of them (Example the Chiefs) when you look at the jerseys they are wearing you can tell that the images were taken in different locations with different lighting. If you had the time I would highly suggest taking these images and playing around with things such as the hue/saturation, brightness/contrast and the curves adjustments on certain parts of the images using layer masks in photoshop to make it so all of the players look like they are in the same line up and fit together. \r\n\r\n(On a side note while we are talking about things such as layer masks these can be an extremely useful tool if you are cutting out the images for each of the players. Majority of people will simply delete the background when trying to remove it. But if you use a layer mask instead if you notice something further down the track such as you cut just a bit too much out of a player&#039;s elbow for example, instead of having to use a backup and cut out the specific part to put it back in, you can use the layer mask to ease it back in using a hard or soft brush in photoshop. This can also be used for the opposite in getting rid of small parts of green screens that are on the edge of skin for example if you want to make it look natural.)\r\n\r\nTo keep going with the theme of what you could do on the player pages, I suggest also having a look at re doing the images for each player to get to the information on each of them. Why I bring this up is that for example if you go to Dire Wolves&rsquo; page, you will notice that the some of the players will have a black background behind them, whereas others will have no background at all. Having the consistency of either background or no background would be nice here.\r\n\r\nAs an idea if you are going to to take the time to re do this, something could would be to have the line up of each team interactable. Have it so that when you hover each player in the line up, the other four fade a little and it gives the information on what lane they are from and their name. You can then choose a player to click on to get their bio and maybe some social media links as to where to find them if you want to follow that player.\r\n\r\n**The Website - OPL Broadcast.**\r\n\r\nMy next thing I would like to talk about is the broadcast on the website itself. Personally I am a fan of being able to watch and sometimes interact with twitch chat, but I do really enjoy watching it on youtube because of certain quality options that twitch doesn&rsquo;t have. I think that on the website if you could choose what broadcast you want to watch from youtube along with twitch but also choose what chat you want to be a part of on the website it would be very cool. Being able to watch the youtube stream while having twitch chat can be a major draw in for some viewers and there is an audience for it. Being able to have the chat there on the website I think would be a major draw in for people to watch from there that are usually watching on twitch.\r\n\r\nAnother interesting thing to note would be able to have the page of the broadcast update with certain stats or information. For example if chiefs vs legacy was playing at the time, below the broadcast while those two teams are playing, people can scroll down to view information on each team that is currently playing (In the case of this example it would be legacy and chiefs) whenever they want while they are watching. Though i&#039;m unsure how possible this would be I think it would really add to the website considering you could also add other cool things such as matchups with the lanes to see how their KDA&rsquo;s lined up and etc.\r\n\r\n**The Youtube Channel.**\r\n\r\nThe last thing I would like to note on is the &ldquo;League of Legends - Oceania&rdquo; youtube channel. I think that the youtube channel has great potential if there are a few things that were updated about it to bring in new viewers and encourage people to watch the videos more.\r\n\r\nI think that the first thing that could be done to help this would be video thumbnails for all of the OPL matches. Though it would take time to go back and do all of the preview matches&rsquo; thumbnails and it may not have much of an impact, I think going into next split if you had thumbnails for each game it would help increase viewer numbers a lot. Have both team&rsquo;s names and logos on the thumbnails, maybe the line ups, what match in the series it&rsquo;s in etc. This also opens up an opportunity for something else that I will go over shortly.\r\n\r\nThe next thing that could be improved with the youtube channel are the playlists that it has. Currently for OPL there is only one big playlist. I think for people wanting to find a specific match from a long time ago or want to relive past splits it might be a good idea to cut the current playlist that is there into what splits the games were in. Not only does this help keep things organized but it helps fans find the games that they want to.\r\n\r\nThe last thing is something I hinted about when I was talking about thumbnails. Currently when you go to the website or the youtube channel, it can be very obvious how long a series lasts. Have it be a best of five that was won in 3 games for example. There is a very big audience out there that is unable to watch the games live that want to be able to go back and watch the matches without them being spoilt before they go back to watch. One way that could help these fans do this more easily is to create videos that look like they have a realistic amount of time in them, same thumbnails as the rest of the series saying what game it would have been, but when the video actually plays it&#039;s just there so that people don&rsquo;t know how long the series lasted for. This helps people that go back and watch vods feel excited that they don&rsquo;t know the outcome of the series when the jump in.\r\n\r\n**Final Notes.**\r\n\r\nAll up I just wanted to say that OPL this year has been the most enjoyable eSport I have ever watched and I think that Riot has done an amazing job at everything to do with it. There is always room to improve though and I want to help you guys create the best events and spectator sports that you can, both from a designers perspective but a viewer&#039;s perspective as well. If any of these things that I noted help, please let me know, and if you have any specific questions for me feel free to ask those as well. Hope these things helped, and I look forward to watching next year of OPL. I do apologize for the wall of text as well, I find it the best way to get out my thoughts in detail.\r\n\r\n - Elam","replies":[{"poster":"CptStupendous","date":"2016-09-02T18:31:17.099+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hi Elam!\n\nThank you so much for the detailed post and thank you for throwing your support behind an OPL team!\n\nFirstly, your different pieces of feedback touch many of the different departments on the team, so we've circulated this thread :-) I won't comment on each individual piece because I'm not a subject matter expert on many of them, but rest assured they have been passed on and are greatly appreciated. \n\nAlso thank you for the compliment on the new website, I agree it's much better than the previous one (visually and functionally) and I agree there's a lot more we can do with it. I see the website as one of the best tools for helping fans engage with the league, players and teams and at the moment whilst I think it's a strong MVP there's a lot of room to improve and add new features. \n\nRegarding the broadcast, have you checked out watch.lolesports.com during a game? This is a relatively new platform and there are a lot of components we can build into it which will provide new and interesting ways to engage with the broadcast and the auxiliary content it creates. \n\nI definitely agree with you on the Youtube channel and we have plans to overhaul it during the off season. The VOD's get pretty good views even with the sub optimal state the page is in at the moment, so I think there's an appetite we're not currently meeting aka a missed opportunity. Whilst challenging, I think some of what you've suggested there is really cool!\n\nI'm glad you enjoyed 2016! We feel like it was a good step forward on 2015 and we definitely agree there's still many things that we can be improving year on year. We're an ambitious team and we want the best for the fans so we look forward to upping our game in the 2017 season!\n\nCheers!\n\nDaniel aka CptStupendous, \nEsport Lead, Oceania","replies":[{"poster":"Captain Fortune","date":"2016-09-03T01:06:15.474+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Good to hear,\n\nI do apologize though as the only times i have checked out the website for the live stream specifically when it was live was earlier on in the season after the new website had just be revamped there probably are some new features that I have caught since I didn't either didn't get a chance or my brain just defaulted to watching on twitch. Looking forward to having a look at what it looks like when a game is live next.\n\nI would like to comment on about how you said some of the stuff may be challenging, if this is an issue of not having enough hands on deck to lend a hand I would be more than willing. I actually have done some concepts myself I believe a few months ago as to what the YouTube thumbnails may look like and I would love to have the chance to flesh them out with you guys into a template you could use going into the 2017 split. Me lending a hand applies to more than just this though if there are other areas design or etc that I can lend a hand.\n\nLet me know if there is anything else I can do to help out, I can be reached either here or in client (if I'm on my computer I'm logged in usually.) Again glad to hear that its been circulated around and I hope I can hear from others if my feedback has helped them.\n\n- Elam","replies":[{"poster":"CptStupendous","date":"2016-09-26T07:03:34.914+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Sorry for the late reply here!
