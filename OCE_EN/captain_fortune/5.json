So without further ado, let&#039;s get right into the first section.\n\n# Understanding &quot;Power&quot; in League:\n\nhttp://i.imgur.com/9DxaS6K.jpg\n\nWhen you play a game of league your champion has a certain amount of power. This power comes of your runes, masteries, champions selected and events that happen in game such as what items you have, if the enemy uses important cooldowns and etc. When you have power you need to decide when to use it to be aggressive in trades, go for all ins, get kills and when to team fight. \n\nIn a sense, if you know that you have more power than your opponent or that you know you can out play them and come out with a victory, you want to force that fight. This applies to 1v1s and doesn&rsquo;t change even up to 5v5 team fights later in the game.\n\n---\n\nEverything that you do in league is a choice, from the masteries you take in certain situations, to the fights that you take, to if you should go get that minion wave bot lane or group with the team. If you can learn from the mistakes that you make, and capitalise on enemies that make incorrect choices, you will find yourself winning trades and more winning games. \n\nWith that in mind let&rsquo;s start by going over the choices you make before the game, in runes, masteries and the champions that you play. Then I am going to role into some other tips such as setting yourself goals and keeping track of your improvement.\n\n# Runes:\n\nhttp://i.imgur.com/9DxaS6K.jpg\n\nRunes is something I think that every summoner needs when going into ranked, each season however Riot likes to change these in some way. For example this season we had the addition of Lethality.\n\nNow when you start out you will have two rune pages, and that can be pretty limiting as it is usually not the best idea to have a rune page that is perfect for one champion at that point, that won&rsquo;t work well on others. This is where the four basic rune pages I am going to introduce you to come in.\n\n_Please note that these rune pages are for people on a budget IP wise, while there are other options, these are what I have found work best for the price required to get them._\n\n---\n\n## AD:\n\nFirst rune page is pretty self explanatory as with the rest on this list. In my opinion this rune page is a **must have.** This rune page you are going to want to be using for any AD Champions that you want to play, unless you have a rune page that suits them better. This rune page can be used for ADCs (Going to go into a specific ADC rune page in a minute), top laners, certain mid laners, junglers and some supports. The important thing to remember is if AD is their main scaling/source of damage this will probably be the best rune page to take on them.\n\nFor the specifics of the rune page you are going to be want:\n3x AD Quintessences, 9x AD Marks, 9x Armor Seals and 9x Magic Resist Glyphs.\n\nhttp://i.imgur.com/9r6oJgS.jpg\n\n---\n\n## AP:\n\nThe next rune page is one that you are going to want to use on the AP champions you play, from mid laners, certain junglers, some top laners and quite a few supports. Like the AD rune page above this is the second **must have** which will complete your rune pages if you only have two slots for them. \n\nFor the specifics of the rune page, I would recommend running.\n3x AP Quintessences, 9x Magic Pen Marks, 9x Armor Seals and 9x Magic Resist Glyphs.*\n\n*Optionally if you want to be a bit more aggressive you could swap out the Glyphs for more ability power or some cooldown reduction, however if you are on a budget for runes IP wise I would recommend just sticking with Magic Resist as they are the safest and you can use them on your AD page as well, saving you some IP.\n\nhttp://i.imgur.com/ri6y18F.jpg\n\n---\n\n## Tank/Support:\n\nThis rune page is for your more tanky champions in the top lane such as Shen, Malphite, Nautilus or your tanky support picks Thresh, Braum, Leona. Letting you soak up more damage while still having some AD from your marks to help with last hitting or your auto attack damage in general.\n\nOnto the specifics of the rune page I&rsquo;d recommend using:\n3x Armor Quintessences, 9x Attack Damage Marks, 9x Armor Seals, 9x Magic Resist Glyphs.\n\nhttp://i.imgur.com/sW86KTL.jpg\n\n---\n\n## ADC:\n\nThe last basic rune page that I want to go over would be for ADCs or Marksmen. ADCs can generally use the standard AD page if you are on a budget quite well, however if you have the extra rune page, having a specific rune page set up for them will help you out in the long run. The page itself is very similar to the AD page with only 1-2 changes.\n\nSpecifics of the ADC rune page that I recommend.\n3x Attack Speed Quintessences, 9x Attack Damage Marks, 9x Armor Seals, 9x Magic Resist Glyphs*. \n\n*Now as a quick note here if you have the extra IP leftover, you can consider running up to 6 attack speed or mana regen Glyphs if you want me more aggressive in your rune choices.\n\nhttp://i.imgur.com/zUj1F3O.jpg\n\n---\n\nHave more rune pages and don&rsquo;t know what to do with them?\n\nIf you have more than 4 rune pages you have a few options for what you can do with them. \n\nWhat some people like to do is set up situational variants of the basic rune pages such as a version of the AP rune page with magic resist glyphs if they see they are vsing an AP opponent in lane, or ability power glyphs if they see they are vsing an AD opponent in lane.\n\nI personally like to set up rune pages that are specifically &ldquo;min/maxed&rdquo; for the champions I like playing the most. There are certain champions that work well with specific runes that not a lot of champions use, so this lets you set up a rune page specifically for them to maximize your rune potential on them.\n\n---\n\nIf you have a specific champion that you want to set up a rune page for and you aren&rsquo;t sure what to go with, make sure you leave a comment asking me and I will get back to you with what I would advise. Along with that you can always go look up, up-to-date guides on the champion, or do research as to what the pros are taking on your favourite champions.\n\n# Masteries:\n\nhttp://i.imgur.com/9DxaS6K.jpg\n\nUp next after runes is masteries. So what I would recommend for your mastery pages is to set up masteries for the champions that you play, making sure to take the masteries that you think will both best suit the champion you are playing, and best suit your playstyle. **Make sure that you understand why you took certain masteries over others, so that in champion select you can re evaluate and make changes based on the champions the enemy picked if needed**\n\n_Keep in mind these mastery pages are here just to get you started. These should be changed and adjusted as you play._\n\n---\n\nThere are some roles for example that use a lot of similar mastery pages. A great example of this would be ADCs. Almost all ADCs use a similar base mastery page with the exception of sometimes swapping out the keystone between Fervor of Battle and Warlords Bloodlust. \n\nAs with all things in league this is a trade off. The usual thought process is that if you are going to be up and close to enemies or you are going to be taking a lot of damage warlords is the better option. Fervor takes time to get the stacks to use effectively, so you need to be able to take extended trades for this to become better than warlords. So pick between the two situationally, warlords will help you survive, and fervor will give you more damage the longer trades go on.\n\nhttp://i.imgur.com/mptAWOg.jpg\n\n---\n\nThe next role that has a lot of champions that share the similar mastery pages would be Mid lane with AP mages. A lot of these champions like to focus on the middle tree Cunning and the keystone Thunderlords Decree. As a bit of a starting point for your mid laner mastery pages, here is what I run as a starting page on a lot of AP mages such as Ahri.\n\nhttp://i.imgur.com/eAet0E6.jpg\n\n---\n\nFor a tank mastery Page for example there are going to be 2 different masteries that you are going to want to swap between for your Lane and two to swap between for your champion. \n\nhttp://i.imgur.com/zOzjNJC.jpg\n\n###### Example Tank Mastery Page\n\nThe first being the difference between taking bandit or taking dangerous game. When you are playing a tank in the bot Lane as support you are going to most likely going to want to take bandit to help with gold income, however when you are playing a tank top you are going to want dangerous game.\n\nhttp://i.imgur.com/GNwmsdf.jpg\n\nThe second of which being champion dependent will be the difference between taking Courage of the Colossus or Grasp of the Undying. If the tank that you are playing has hard CC and can proc COTC it&#039;s most often better to take that over Grasp. If you are a tank and can&#039;t proc COTC you are most likely going to want Grasp.\n\nhttp://i.imgur.com/MEVAbwz.jpg\n\n---\n\n> Regarding Masteries I would also advise if you're going into the Resolve tree, that Siegemaster and Fearless are both incredibly valuable options that should be considered! Siege master is incredibly efficient given the resistances it provides for free early, so if you're being hit by mostly champions or being pushed in early it works well.\nFearless is a decision between needing summoners cooldowns (Lee Sin/Malphite) and resistances when taking damage when you don't need the summoners.\n- Note from Rusty on the Resolve Mastery Tree.\n\n---\n\nWhen you are building your own mastery pages for your champions, I would recommend doing research to see what other players are running on the champion. As a tip to get you started focusing on a specific keystone that you want to take can be a good starting point as well.\n\nAlways keep your mastery pages updated depending on what you are up against in a specific game and what works best for your playstyle.\n\n# Champion Pool.\nhttp://i.imgur.com/9DxaS6K.jpg\n\nThe next thing that you need to prepare before going into ranked is having a good champion pool. Now a champion pool should be a collection of champions that you are comfortable in playing. I would recommend having a champion pool of around 3-5 champions for the main two roles that you play, and 1-2 champions for other roles incase you get auto filled. \n\n---\n\nIf you are wondering how to build a champion pool for yourself I can help with that as well. Let me run through a bit of example of how I would build a champion pool for myself and how I have done so in the past. \n\nThe first thing to figure out is what your favourite champion is, playing your favourite champion can help a lot as it will keep your mentality positive and help you have fun as you learn. As you can see for this example I am going to use Ahri and build a champion pool off of her.\n\nhttp://i.imgur.com/bovZKGl.jpg\n\nNow that we have Ahri we can delve into the type of champion that she is. Now Ahri is a AP burst mage, that could be classed as an Assassin, usually goes into the mid lane as well. With that information we can think of other AP mages to branch out into other champions. Now my personal favourite part of Ahri&rsquo;s kit would be both being an Assassin, and her team fight ability with the combos that she has.\n\nFor me when I branch out in both directions using those as pointers, I land on Akali for the Assassin part, and then Lux for her combos and team fight presence.\n\nhttp://i.imgur.com/PFdbyGi.png\n\nFrom there we can branch out even further, from Akali we get a similar playstyle in Katarina and from Lux we get a somewhat similar playstyle in Orianna. \n\nThat is the basics of how to build a champion pool around the playstyles that you enjoy. I now have five different champions that I can try to see if I like, and if I do can play in ranked once I am confident in playing them.\n\n# Set yourself goals:\n\nhttp://i.imgur.com/9DxaS6K.jpg\n\nWhen you are playing ranked I find it&#039;s always good to have a goal to work towards, but lately I have found that it&#039;s actually even better if you have two types of goals to work towards.\n\n## A rank goal:\n\nThe first goal will be your rank goal, I would recommend setting not to far from your starting position and then moving it as you reach it, maybe 1-2 divisions at max. This helps you see real progress towards your goal and helps you climb at a good pace.\n\n---\n\n## A improvement goal:\n\nThe second goal should be your goal on what you want to improve on. For example pick some part of your gameplay over the next 10-20 games that you aren&rsquo;t particularly good at. For example it could be warding or csing. Once you have picked your goal, go into each game wanting to put a bit more focus onto doing that correctly until it becomes natural to a point that you are happy with it, and then move to another area that you could improve on.\n\n---\n\nWith your goals set out this way you not only will be climbing goal wise but your skills will be increasing at the same time. If you can learn while you climb you will find your ride up the ranked ladder a lot more smooth. Players often find themselves hitting walls if they grind out games where they can&rsquo;t climb any higher. That is a point where the player in question needs to improve parts of their gameplay before they will be able to climb further. Always be consistent and constantly be learning.\n\n# Ranked Diaries:\n\nhttp://i.imgur.com/9DxaS6K.jpg\n\nOne thing that will help you improve as you play is a ranked Diary. What ranked Diaries are is as the name implies a log of how you are doing in ranked. Now how I recommend you set these out is after each game you write down, when the game was played, what your score/cs was and if it was a victory or defeat. After that paste in a screenshot of the after game lobby. \n\nBelow the screenshot, write down 3 things that you feel you did well at and 3 things you feel that you need to improve on from that game. This will help give you a clear understanding of what you need to improve on, and what your strengths are. After a few games you will start to see a pattern and understand what parts of your gameplay you need to focus on.\n\n---\n\nTo give you a bit of an example, I do a Ranked Diary myself using google docs so that its with me everywhere I go as long as I&#039;m signed into my google account. Here is a visual example of how I would lay it out:\n\n05/01/2016\nAkali - 11/5/6 - Victory\n\nhttp://i.imgur.com/B4Xsqev.jpg\n\n3 things I could have done better:\n\nUsed my trinket more while roaming around.\nPunished Veigar when he didn&rsquo;t have his stun up.\nRespected Varus&rsquo; ult more.\n\n3 things I did well at:\n\nI roamed around the map well especially to bot lane.\nI understood what I needed to do to win the game under laning phase and I executed it well.\nThe times I did die I was able to learn from them and adjust accordingly.\n\n---\n\n# Thanks for reading! \n\nI hope this advice helps you on your 2017 climb.
