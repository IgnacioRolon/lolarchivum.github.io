Spending the time to unlock them, figuring out what they they do and learning combos and how to play them in game, getting more slots to fine tune your prefers playstyle while finding a build that you like and know how to play with is rewarding and enjoyable. The mind are remenicent of star guardian but the level design and ascetic combined with a few new faces make it look and feel like a new and bright gamemode. The kayn boss fight is interesting with different ways of counterplay for the most part and is balanced quite well.\n\nCONS:\nWhile this gamemode has alot going for it there are just a few problems that hold it back from being better or in my opinion the best PVE to date (from riot) One of the problems that are encountered are the amount of bugs, there are a tremendous amount e.g. being unable to press keys until escape is pressed (that took awhile to figure out,) Queue match not appearing and dodging acdentialy, pressing accept on a match just for it to say you dodged, locking in and having it say you dodged but not getting a ban, using your revive on an ally even though your teammate just healed them and now it's on cooldown, reviving an ally just for you to not go invulnerable, even if you die and revive your teammate losing the game. Ridiculous framemate drops from sona ult (which isint just because of the tier of computers even my friends with  much better computers than me lagged and lagged more but no other ult did this as much,) glitches to the questing system  (which was mostly fix but they are still there a bit and shouldn't have been there at all. All the bugs listed are the ones that I get decently frequently and that at least 2 of my friends have gotten multiple times to make sure it's not just on my side as well they have large differences in quality of pc and internet speed yet still see the same problems. The quests. In particular the ones that require you to lower the amount of augments you are aloud to use for the first few this is extremely challenging and enticing but getting down to two augments you begin to wonder why you even spent all that time getting them refining your skill and learning your combos in the first place. I think it is challenging and interesting up till two augments (having done 4 and 3 augments) but up to two it begins to get a little ridiculous and I believe harder difficulties should just be unlocked rather then losing all the progress you have built up. This could be my biast leaking in but one champions with or without augments feel stronger than others however I find this is minor compared but one example is the strenth yasuo has when kayn is foreign out blue orbs that are if you're close enough one shot and he can sash to avoid while most others have to use all of there warps or just cant survive. Last is a small complain that mostly sums up to repitiveness, the champion pool feels just a little to small.\n\nPersonal Opinion:\n\nThis is my second favorite PVE gamemode and my third favorite gamemode ever only beat out by star guardian which was just this but fixed a few of the issues that I had with this one but I do prefer the brighter look of this one but the gameplay and style of invasion I prefer more the only other one I like more is normal U.R.F but after going through rehabilitation I am beginning to move on from my addiction and trying to enjoy different gamemodes just as much. All round I love PVE gamemode and hope there will be many more \"Extraction\" is my second favorite and I love how different and independent it is and the skins it have us.\n\nPs: That Kayn skin is beautiful. Am in love.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Limbo","date":"2018-09-16T08:06:11.457+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Really cool mode and the mode brought me back to the game for a decent amount of hours of power gaming. \n\nOnly suggestions would be around the event missions and how solo players experience a pretty toxic pre-chat lobby. \n\nWould be good if the aug limit missions didn’t require to be sequenced (as I was guilted into completing two augs before I had it available and making me bitter once it unlocked). \n\nAlso keen to bring back team finding tools in client (miss public chat rooms)","replies":[]},{"poster":"Nagishi","date":"2018-09-16T03:25:44.921+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Odyssey: Extraction PVE game mode is an excellent game mode! It has a variety of enemies that require different strategies to deal with such as equipping specific augments for each enemy they are encountering. This game mode also has brought a lot of people together to team up and cooperate with each other with little-to-none disagreement (even though it is quite a challenge due to human nature) in order to achieve what they have in common, which is completing missions.\n\nThe game mode also implements augments which is a great idea as it enables players to go all out with their creativity and come up with ridiculous but tactical augments such as with Yasuo's augments; Retribution and Wandering. Not only that, the game mode makes players attentive and rational as there are aspects in the game mode which can punish the players pretty harshly if they are not paying attention. Aspects such as the duration of Resuscitate and the traversing of the terrain.\n\nAs for the missions, the missions are reasonably hard and requires actual effort and cooperation. Missions such as Planetary Legends, Galactic Legends, Universal Legends and so on. The missions follow a gradient of difficulty and progress to become more difficult as the players are getting more in sync with the game mode. The reward is worth it for the amount of effort put into completing the mission such as the skin shard for Odyssey Ziggs and an Odyssey Gem for those who are unable to afford to purchase with RP. This induces a feeling of victorious which drives players more to complete other missions and so on.\n\nAs for the bugs, I have scrutinised each round and have found none or too little of a hassle to be considered a bug. It is a well-polished game mode close to perfection.\n\nRiot has put a large amount of effort into PVE game modes like Star Guardian and Odyssey which makes it such a fun time during the event.\n\nThat is all from me.\n\n{{sticker:sg-kiko}}","replies":[]},{"poster":"willsgotskills","date":"2018-10-02T14:42:05.654+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Good: \nGetting more friends on league since you need help with missions, helping others is usually a good thing\nRelatively fresh concept, pve is also less stressful (?) compared to having to constantly think about how to play against real players\nAugments allow for customisation, especially things like AP jinx or on-hit ziggs which many of the people I played with thought was a troll build at first.\n\n\nBad:\nMissions caused solo/duo/casual players grief since I've met some who have never cleared the onslaught at all with everyone spamming ff and demanding their missions to be done first ( I tried to help some but that's limited to my time, and I can't help all of them can I?)\nThe bug which loads people into the game with no augments...\nSome augments were just useless, since most of the time only the OP ones were taken\nSome mob spawns were much harder than others which makes RNG play a part in runs succeeding.\nMore attention can be brought to the discords which the community has been using, or League itself could make its own to help group for missions either in game or outside the game. \nMore attention also needs to be brought to this OCE specific event, I only saw this today (8 days before the end of the event), maybe put a link somewhere in the game?\nAlso cannot see death stats\nSome champions were much stronger/played than others, e.g. malphite only appears in a 4 yasuo setup to group mobs up, ziggs/sona were definitely less played than yasuo/jinx unless missions required it, and without copying strategies you usually couldn't get them to pull their weight.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Krispy Migraine","date":"2018-09-21T18:49:24.107+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The new mode is really cool, it's just the missions for onslaught that ruin it all. Sometimes you'll come across someone that wants to do 4 augs, and someone that wants to do 2 so then people start complaining. If one person brings more than what they want, they'll just ff. And if you do follow the others, you only get your mission that you're on completed and not their mission. Most of the time I dodge. There's also a lot of bugs.

Then I'm left with only 7 seconds to pick my augments. If I'm not doing the ofa mission, the team may have decided to do the 4- augment challenge instead, but I don't have enough time to decide what augment to remove, or what set of augments I should change to.\n\nI think teams should regain their lost life if they win a stage. Often my team would lose the first stage, and have 0 lives at the fourth, so we can't even have a warm-up or a chance to make a new plan or strategy. Teams should also have the ability to get a full refund of the items they have bought prior to the round starting.\n\nIt's a fun mode. I'm always delighted to see new modes to play. The augments seem like they've had a lot of work put into them, and have very interesting and creative results. I love the characters and how they have short bios to introduce them well. I'm very glad to see this co-op mode back again!","replies":[]}]}
