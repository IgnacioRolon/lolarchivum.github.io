Didnt even know this was coming out!\n\nAs an Org manager, and someone who has worked with Elam, I can attest to what he has written above.\n\nAlso nothing happens quickly. Elam enjoys a position of trust because he has been reliable OVER TIME, and was never about flashing around his connections.\n\nWork hard, and like Sebbie, the new House Manager for Sin Gaming, positions will come to those who are patient. Sebbie was the House manager for X5 before that all went bust, but she waited it out, kept applying and working networks connections, and is still progressing her esports career and dream.\n\nThere are plenty of volunteer, and increasingly to some extent, paid positions in Australian esports. Just be prepared to put in a few years!","replies":[]},{"poster":"kitasai","date":"2017-08-20T10:01:26.345+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Awesome!!!","replies":[]},{"poster":"CptStupendous","date":"2017-05-26T05:03:26.809+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"This is a fantastic post!\n\nPassionate fans who want to contribute are a huge part of all esports teams.\n\nYou could say the same about AFL or NRL teams not so long ago. It was the passionate fans who volunteered their time for the club who helped make them what they are. \n\nIf you're passionate about esports reach out to your favourite team.
