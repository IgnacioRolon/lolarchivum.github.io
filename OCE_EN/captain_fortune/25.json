Pixel art is always pixellated, but a pixellated image or drawing is not always pixel art. Drawing/painting at a low resolution can be a good start, but it is not inherently pixel art.\n                                                                                                        .\n___\n\n######**_~~EXAMPLES~~_**\n\nhttps://i.imgur.com/OPyXfzi.png?noredirect vs https://i.imgur.com/zVq54DV.png?noredirect\n\nA good way to distinguish them if you are unsure is to take a step back.\n\nhttps://i.imgur.com/m9nQGhG.png?noredirect vs https://i.imgur.com/EkTeg6a.png?noredirect\n\nPixel art isn't art painted at a low resolution to make it pixellated, it's art created (or refined) on the pixel level. More pixels (higher resolution) means more work to refine the effect, and pixel art generally follows the \"less is more\" policy.","replies":[{"poster":"Fallion","date":"2019-07-11T16:48:45.042+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Does it mean I'll submit it 1350 by 1080 or 150 by 120 (multiplied/divided by 9)?","replies":[{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2019-07-12T10:44:21.903+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You can submit in 150 x 120 :)\n\nIt's the shape that matters not the size.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Prue","date":"2019-07-01T08:22:56.292+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Does this:\n \n\"This artwork must be in 1350x1080 (or multiples of) aspect ratio.\" \n\nMean that the piece could be portrait?

We keep trying to think of a better way to say it, but basically, we're looking for a specific shape, not necessarily a specific size, and different programs use different metrics so we're trying to keep it as universal as possible without being confusing. \n\nThis also means that no, this cannot be a portrait piece, it must remain landscape.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Mashuun","date":"2019-07-01T11:10:33.945+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"It means you can multiply it / divide both sides, keeping the same ratio. For 1350x1080, that is 5:4.\n\nFor pixel art, you would want to do it in something like 360 x 288, which is still 5:4 ratio, then upscale once finished.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Canc","date":"2019-07-09T00:24:07.110+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I thought I gave up on finishing the piece and just submitted yesterday, then 1 hour later I had some idea and want to push for it to finish. \n\nMy question is I linked my art, but can I continue to modify my entry on that same link?
