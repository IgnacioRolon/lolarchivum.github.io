To be able to switch roles that dramatically without necessarily selling all your items is a huge boon for players who are good at reading the flow of the game, and will help bring back games that are slipping due to over/underfed allies and enemies. \n\nWall walking is obviously something we have all thought about at one point or another, I think this will almost certainly be his strongest ability, As a guy who plays roaming champions, I can appreciate how powerful this will be for roaming/ganking quickly and undetected from places no one expects. However I would have liked to see some kind of restriction on it like with Sol's E, so that he cant wall walk within a couple of seconds of being damaged, otherwise he might well become just too slippery, and there are already a fair number of champions who have near-guaranteed escapes. \n\nI think wall walking will be invaluable for stealing baron/dragon too. To slip back and forth over the wall not only terrifies the other team but significantly reduces the risk jumping the wall into known/unknown territory would usually have. \n\nHis other two abilities seem fairly straightforward.\nA dash with a spin _(I don't really see the difference between this and the shit Yasuo pulls)_.\nand a skillshot slow.\n\nI am fond of the shadow-assassin version of the W though, there will be some neat plays centred around that I reckon. \nUsing it to Zone the enemy to make sure they walk where you want them to, so you can land a guaranteed Q, or position yourself without losing the time taken from casting.\n\nHis ult is interesting. I would imagine it would play very similar to Fizz's playful/trickster though in a teamfight, It's a brief escape from the brawl to avoid a scary ability, or just to catch your breath, with a nice chunk of damage afterwards. \nIt would have been cool to see some form of control with it though, puppeteering the victim, perhaps beign able to cast one or two of their spells for your advantage. _(perhaps in a future champ?)_\n\nBut it also prevents any chance of escape by the unfortunate victim, _(you cant flash or Lantern away, becasue youll take the reaper along for a ride as well.)_\n**I really want to see a poppy screw over an allied Kayn with her ult xD** \nthrow him into the summoners platform or into a whole group of enemies or something. It'd be hilarious. \nand there are the interactions like Shen's ult which they have talked about, _(but I cant see that particular situation happening an awful lot..)_\n\nTaliyah or TF could potentially take Kayn into the summoner platform though, id like to try that out. \n\n\n_________\n\nIn terms of Theme.\nI think riot have done a great job tbh, he's an assassin/reaper type champ _(which is the preferred theme for nearly all unimaginative 12-25 year olds.)_ so we can expect him to not be underplayed! Not to mention many of the popular skin lines will work exceptionally well with him. \n\nHis shadow-assassin W connects him perfectly with Zed's organisation, while his Scythe and Darkin form link him perfectly to Aatrox's world.\nand the voice interactions between him and the scythe are awesome! they are both badass as well as comical. _(voice overs make all the difference when making a champ enjoyable to play!)_\n\nSo I am looking forward to seeing _(and hopefully playing)_ him on the rift.","replies":[{"poster":"Time Criminal","date":"2017-06-28T08:10:03.242+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Lord Sesshomaru,realm=OCE,application-id=FjGAIbRv,discussion-id=4NIAVHgw,comment-id=0001,timestamp=2017-06-28T05:33:05.521+0000)\n\n> Wall walking is obviously something we have all thought about at one point or another, I think this will almost certainly be his strongest ability, As a guy who plays roaming champions, I can appreciate how powerful this will be for roaming/ganking quickly and undetected from places no one expects.
