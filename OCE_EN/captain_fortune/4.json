If you are entering as a team, make sure that you are all queuing together in your games for the most accurate representation of your team&rsquo;s progress.\n\n# Want to find a team to play with?\n\nGo have a look at our [&quot;Finding Homeguards to Play With&quot;](http://boards.oce.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/team-recruitment/a7WdEyU4-volunteer-ocean-week-finding-fellow-homeguards-to-play-with) post and join the discord to start playing with other summoners. From there you can form a team you want to regularly play with and start grinding points towards winning!\n\n---\n\n# Rules\n\n**At the end of Ocean Week, come back here and post screenshots of each of your player&rsquo;s client pages showing their score along with their summoner name at the end of Ocean Week**. You will have 24 hours after Ocean Week has ended to submit these, and the winners will be announced the next day.\n\nAs with all competitions though, there must be rules and here are the few that we have for you to follow:\n\n+ Teams must consist of no more than 5 players.\n+ You, or any of your teammates can only be a part of 1 team.\n+ Once you have picked your team to play with, your team name and players are locked in and cannot be changed.\n+ Only maps that are eligible to gain points in Ocean Week will be counted (you may play on other maps too, but you won&#039;t get any points for those games)\n+ Make sure that you have permission to sign up your team from each player.\n+ Don&rsquo;t change your Summoner Name so that we can track your progress.\n\n**Make sure you come back to post your team&rsquo;s results!**\n\nThe winning team/player will get 10 Hextech Chests (divided equally amongst players if you&rsquo;re in a team) and the runner up will get a 4 win IP boost per player.\n\n---\n\n# Sign Up Application\n\nWith the rules stated, here is the google doc to sign up your team with:\n\nhttps://goo.gl/forms/yiX8o9nrNPcZXPEW2\n\n---\n\nWe are excited to see what strategies you come up with!
