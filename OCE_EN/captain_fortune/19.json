Make sure that a little bit of the U bend is visible and you'll be sweet!\n\nI'd also not wrap her arm around the letter because it's kind of breaking the flow of the image - she's charging towards the left and engaging her in the same space/world as the letter physically means I'm now trying to relate those 2 things in my brain (and all of a sudden it doesn't make sense!). I suggest just having her on a layer above the letters instead.","replies":[{"poster":"Captain Fortune","date":"2016-01-13T09:45:14.536+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey mate just curious.
