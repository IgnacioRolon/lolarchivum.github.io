If you're looking to play with a Rioter, the Help & Support sub-boards probably aren't the best place to look. But fear not; all hope is not lost. You're most likely to find a Rioter response on the [**General Discussion**](http://boards.oce.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/general-discussion) sub-boards or the [**Miscellaneous**](http://boards.oce.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/miscellaneous) sub-boards! Alternatively, there's a chatroom inside the League of Legends client that Rioters sometimes join, named \"PlayWithRiot\". \n\nGood luck on your search, and again, congratulations!","replies":[]}]}
