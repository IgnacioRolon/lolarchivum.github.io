YOU BAN ME ! Really? This is what you do to your support / money makers , i just bought RP and I wanted to play so bad I did and guess what you ban me for 5 games waiting 20 minutes each time!

Please reply to this , I am this close to never ever playing this bull shit you call a game . \r\n\r\nP.S - Don't give me that \"oh it show's that you afk'd\" I couldn't log into the game there is a difference I didn't manually press Quit game .","replies":[{"poster":"HORSE OF FORCE","date":"2015-02-13T05:19:23.526+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> I recently played a ranked team game only to find out in the loading screen that my game crashes about 4 games before that my internet disconnected and i couldn't reconnect\n\nSo, so you're in the loading screen, waiting for the game to load in, and then suddenly it hits you: your game crashed **four games before that**. Like, you only just realised this after playing three other games.\n\nSorry, that's just hilarious.\n\nAre you sure it was a ban and not just a penalty? That's quite a severe difference, as a ban is usually handed out by a moderator who's reviewed your case.\n\nAlso, during that time, it was still not implemented into the system to detect whether or not your purposefully quit or was disconnected. There's nothing that can really be done about it.\n\nWould you like to try and fix your connection issue?","replies":[{"poster":"Yazo","date":"2015-04-04T10:01:22.970+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I men't before i was crashing , I disconnected due to internet issues but i ended up joining later on . Also i said bug splat wouldn't let me get into the game when we were on loading screen it would crash constantly . I played 4 games before that so i could get out of the leaver buster , but on the last game i couldn't connect due to bug splat so i had to play another 5 games waiting 20 minutes each . Don't say \"Thats Hilarious \" Because the system sucks balls . It wasn't even my fault . I've been playing for 4 years , so don't mock me , I have wasted as much time on this shit as it is .","replies":[{"poster":"HORSE OF FORCE","date":"2015-04-04T23:10:43.170+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The hilarious part was how you phrased it, not the misery that the faulty system has put you through. With the way you said it, it would mean that after you initially got disconnected from the game, you played another four games before realising that you got disconnected, as if though your mind had lag at comprehending what had happened.\n\n*I'd never laugh at the misery of others.*\n\nBugsplat is not the thing preventing you from joining the game, the game crashing is the reason, and bugsplat is only there do tell you what happened instead of just nothing at all.\n\nAre you still getting connection issues?","replies":[{"poster":"Yazo","date":"2015-04-07T04:59:34.140+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"No , i am not having connection issues , Plus mate , I didn't disconnect all 4 games , I Got disconnected to put me in leaver buster and on the last game my game crashed but i joined back , but i had to go through it all .

Leavebuster is a bit faulty with its system, and I don't agree with its limits. It should be at least ten minutes of inactivity to be considered AFK, because not all systems can reboot within five minutes.\n\nThis board is here to help people getting their game running again from technical issues, not to complain about the unfairness of the system. That probably belongs on Misc., but even then, people would not appreciate it.","replies":[{"poster":"Yazo","date":"2015-04-10T02:34:04.583+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Really , thats funny .

Even someone who was incompetent would be able to see that it's obviously not what literally happened to you.
