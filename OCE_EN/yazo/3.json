How can you have been booted out of promotions if you only lost two games?","replies":[{"poster":"Yazo","date":"2015-04-25T14:27:23.257+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"i said i lost 2 games so if i lost 1 more that would be 3 its a 3/5 for promotions . To sum it up you have to win 3 but i lost 3 so yea .","replies":[{"poster":"HORSE OF FORCE","date":"2015-04-26T05:37:17.535+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Well, that means the troll only effected one out of your five games. Since you only have to win three, it's still entirely possible for you to do that. And it's not like you have to win three games in a row to be promoted. Is it really that bad?","replies":[{"poster":"Yazo","date":"2015-04-28T12:44:23.295+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"holy crap . Dude , i men't after i played 1 game after losing 2 that 3/5 i lost another so thats 4/5  , 3 losses means no promotion i lost 2 already he made it a third , i didn't even have the chance to try he just took it away from me .","replies":[{"poster":"HORSE OF FORCE","date":"2015-04-29T10:02:50.235+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"My point was to not be so easily deterred by trolls. If you give in like this and make a post complaining about it on the boards, they've accomplished their goals. The best thing to do is report (via client), wait a bit, re-queue and try again.\n\nIf the toxicity is too much, and you don't mind a bit of lag, try moving over to NA. I hear they have a lot less toxicity than OCE; though that's only what I heard.\n\nEither way, best of luck in the future.","replies":[{"poster":"Yazo","date":"2015-04-30T10:56:29.563+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Its not toxicity i'm really annoyed about its the lack of care they don't realize when they troll ranked games they make other people waste their time , normals isnt that bad but ranked you lose LP so if you win a game and then you get matched with a intentional feeder that makes you lose LP , it just throws all that time in the garbage 30 minutes of pure shit just a waste of time aswell as 20-40 minutes of even more wasted time if you are in the trolls game for that long .","replies":[{"poster":"HORSE OF FORCE","date":"2015-04-30T11:32:34.331+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":">they don't realize when they troll ranked games they make other people waste their time\n\nThey realise, and that's the exact reason why they do it. They usually have the attitude, \"Something I don't like happened this game, meaning my time is wasted here. I want to waste everyone's time now!\"\n\nAnd on the subject of time, is playing League for a longer duration of time inherently bad? After that game with the troll/whatever that means you're going to play another game to regain that LP. I like playing video-games for longer. But some people see the game as some sort of occupation.\n\nThis is more a philosophical debate than a discussion about technical issues now.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Super Euro Flash","date":"2015-04-14T22:10:52.966+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Added you on one of my smurf accounts.
