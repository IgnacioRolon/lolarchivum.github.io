I made this account sometime in 2012 and the email I've used i haven't had access for in the last year. I never thought to update it as I didn't think it mattered that much however i realised you need a confirmation email to play LORT . I have tons of proof that i am the only owner of the account , i know the exact post code it was created ,  i know 2/3 refunds that i made in 2013 and i also know the exact email my account is currently linked to . \r\n\r\nI never share my password around and i can tell you what i changed it to . I had already sent a ticket but i wanted to make sure that this gets through and im worried i wont be able to change it because i made it so long ago and my memory is fishy . I was about 12 when i made the account hence why i don't remember what exact champions i first purchased but i know i had purchased the starter pack and i know all mystery gifts i received and who they were from  when they were released in 2013 . I hope we can resolve this issue as i really want to keep my account secure and continue playing League as well as LORT . Thank you &lt;3","replies":[]}
