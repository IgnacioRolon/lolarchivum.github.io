I click on the red arrow and it brings to a page were it has me sign in. I sign in and then it bring me to another page telling me to type in the code that they have sent to my e-mail. I put in the code and it brings me to another page that says my account has been updated and shows my username at the bottom. I go back to the PBE to play since my account has been updated but the same dialog box that has the red arrow that tells me to update my account is still there. I have tried to close the PBE and open it again and doing the whole process of putting in the code but the dialog box is still there. Someone please help me.","replies":[{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2019-11-27T01:03:31.272+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Submit a ticket to player support: https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/requests/new\n\nCould be the update got interrupted at some point and something went a bit wrong. Could be something to do with it being a PBE account. Support should be able to point you in the right direction.","replies":[]}]}
