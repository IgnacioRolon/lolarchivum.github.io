It's important to note that they wont be able to provide you with any information regarding actions taken on other players accounts. If they have shown consistent \"game ruining\" behaviours, then something should be done, even if it takes a while for the systems to get there.\n\nAnother point to consider is that the IFS notifications (in-client pop-up when someone you reported is punished) is notoriously unreliable. It often only notifies a single reporter, and occasionally seems to miss the mark entirely. I would certainly recommend that you *not* use them as any indication of a lack of punishments.","replies":[]}]}
