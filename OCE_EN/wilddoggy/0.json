Same with skins, I just get laughably cheap skins when opening chests and stuff...\r\nThis is just my plead for Riot to really start being considerate of their players, it won&#039;t cost you much to implement a system that doesn&#039;t give me the same shards I already have and to give me more expensive items, or atleast to balance it out. You know how this could&#039;ve been avoided? If they didn&#039;t go for this stupid loot boxes trend that every game these days likes to go with.\r\nAnyways does anyone agree with me or am I alone on this?","replies":[{"poster":"Fitzky","date":"2017-11-26T03:03:38.528+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Just keep complaining so Riot knows the majority of the community doesn't want this, otherwise they'll be like \"ehh a few toxic crybabies they'll stop eventually\".","replies":[{"poster":"Essembie","date":"2017-11-28T09:01:47.857+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Fitzky,realm=OCE,application-id=FjGAIbRv,discussion-id=Qqn9232n,comment-id=0002,timestamp=2017-11-26T03:03:38.528+0000)\n>\n> Just keep complaining so Riot knows the majority of the community doesn&#x27;t want this, otherwise they&#x27;ll be like &quot;ehh a few toxic crybabies they&#x27;ll stop eventually&quot;.\n\npost fatigue lol - so many people are willing to accept such a low standard and in many cases vote against their own interests.\n\nAnd thats why we get conservative governments.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"JasonWazza","date":"2017-11-26T01:21:31.385+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Low rolling is likely to happen upwards of 50% of the time, so yeah every level is going to feel like shit.\n\nWelcome to Tencent Riot, where we don't give a shit and just want your money {{sticker:slayer-jinx-wink}}","replies":[]},{"poster":"Essembie","date":"2017-11-25T20:56:02.903+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I wholeheartedly agree.\n\nget involved in the conversations already going\n\nhttps://boards.oce.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/miscellaneous/iHB2uec5-na-boards-are-full-of-rage-at-lootboxes\n\nhttps://boards.oce.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/miscellaneous/8BhL0J2V-hawaiian-state-representative-chris-lee-announces-action-to-combat-predatory-practices-in-gaming\n\nhttps://boards.oce.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/miscellaneous/GntH5sIB-multiple-complaints-around-the-state-of-the-game-ritodevs\n\nhttps://boards.oce.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/miscellaneous/y2WdLoRa-belgium-says-loot-boxes-are-gambling-wants-them-banned-in-europe","replies":[]}]}
