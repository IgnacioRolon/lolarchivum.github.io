I haven't been a saint either, but this kind of positive reinforcement will make me strive to be more understanding, tolerant and level-headed. \r\n\r\nI'm not sure if I fully deserve this awesome gift, part of me says yes and the other not so much. I'm just happy to have gotten a token from you guys, it didn't matter what it was, it was the gesture that made me feel so grateful. \r\n\r\nCheers!","replies":[{"poster":"Jockulation","date":"2015-01-09T09:47:49.189+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I got the Mystery Skin pop up when logging in.
