The issue will be fixed next week in patch 8.16, but for now I recommend you check out some of the solutions players have found in [this Reddit thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/95klnc/why_are_the_first_10_seconds_of_the_game_just/e3tmb15) and see if they work for you.\n\nFailing that, [Player Support](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/requests/new) may be able to assist in finding out why this problem is so extreme for you and at least getting your delay down to the 8-10 seconds that most people with this issue are seeing. Of course it could be a completely unrelated issue, in which case I'd also recommend immediately submitting a ticket with Player Support.","replies":[{"poster":"Halucagen","date":"2018-08-11T02:40:16.436+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"cool thanks for the help, most of the suggestions in the reddit thread were already done on my pc for other reasons so i guess ill just have to avoid jg for the moment  oh well","replies":[{"poster":"Gehirn","date":"2018-08-17T01:59:21.866+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hi Halucagen, brief update. We've been able to replicate this issue on at least 1 machine, sadly it is still happening after 8.16. But we're working on it right now and hopefully will be able to figure out the problem and get a fix out, or maybe even a workaround for now.\n\nDo let me know if the issue is already resolved for you though.","replies":[{"poster":"Halucagen","date":"2018-08-23T11:33:49.081+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey just an update, the load in is now down to ~45 seconds but i'm now getting bad FPS stuttering when minions spawn in by the looks of it.
