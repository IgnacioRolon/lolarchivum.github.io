Although my team mates have been telling me that i&#039;m not &#039;disconnecting from the game&#039; on their end - i&#039;m just kind of standing there even though on my screen i&#039;m &#039;attempting to reconnect.&#039;\r\n\r\nI&#039;ve never had this issue before in the 3-4 years i&#039;ve been playing and i&#039;ve even been playing on the same PC this whole time.\r\n\r\nIts very strange and frustrating as its unplayable as that 15-20 second &#039;disconnect&#039; is more then enough time to get my killed.\r\n\r\nPlease advice what action is to be taken to resolve this issue.\r\n\r\nCheers,","replies":[{"poster":"SephirothSG","date":"2016-04-10T00:26:30.395+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey there,\n\nCould you do the following for me.\n\n* [Download WinMTR](https://sourceforge.net/projects/winmtr/files/WinMTR-v092.zip/download) and run a traceroute to the following IP.
