I also watched a lot of LCS over the years, so can assist you with information on building a team comp/shot calling if required.\r\n\r\nI also have a working mic.\r\n\r\nHope to hear from you soon.","replies":[{"poster":"5uperTrinity","date":"2016-09-21T23:52:14.314+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You up for a duo partner?
