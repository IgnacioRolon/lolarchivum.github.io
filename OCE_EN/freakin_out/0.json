Long story short i penta&#039;d the team while my team was 9k gold behind at the time and i wasn&#039;t fed, just kinda normal.\n\nBut anyway, i was so focused on what i needed to do and dodging skill shots that i didn&#039;t really get to take in the fight and i barely even rememberer how it happened. hence why I&#039;m here!\n\nIs there any way i can view my previous game so i can watch this play - its probably the best play I&#039;ve ever done in 4 years of playing and i barely even remember it because i was so stressed and focused.. lol\n\nPlease someone reply with some good news for me!! :)\n\nCheers","replies":[{"poster":"SephirothSG","date":"2016-03-30T07:10:23.377+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey there,\n\nYou might have luck with replay.gg, however I'm not sure if it will display replays from before you were registered with their service.\n\nGive it a go anyway and let me know.","replies":[{"poster":"Freakin Out","date":"2016-03-30T09:53:38.461+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"SephirothSG - You sir are a champion!! it worked!!! :D:D:D\n\nI had never used that website before, but it had my game there for me to view!\n\nThanks so much SephirothSG, if i had a gold start sticker i would be placing it on your forehead right now.\n\nRiot - if you are reading, give this man a little something special for me will you? :)\n\nCheers,","replies":[]}]}]}
