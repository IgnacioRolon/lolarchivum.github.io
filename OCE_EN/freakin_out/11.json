I also watched a lot of LCS over the years, so can assist you with information on building a team comp/shot calling if required.\r\n\r\nI also have a working mic.\r\n\r\nHope to hear from you soon.","replies":[{"poster":"fergus","date":"2016-09-16T06:05:04.527+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"ADC main gold 2\n\nWorking mic\n\nIGN:ferguslad","replies":[]},{"poster":"Jewish Boy","date":"2016-09-14T02:17:55.598+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Top/Jg/Adc mostly, Gold V atm, add me if interested\n\nIGN: Jewish Boy","replies":[]},{"poster":"xCheesecake","date":"2016-09-13T12:17:05.297+0000","up_votes":0,"down_votes":0,"body":"Mid Pirmary, ADC secondary... wouldn't mind joining a team :3 throw me an add if interested XD \n\nPS: I also have a working Mic\n\nIGN: Kawaiisenpaidesu","replies":[]}]}
