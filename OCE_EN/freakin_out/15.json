(title was: Random leave buster, but i played the game?&quot;)\r\n\r\nI finally played your 5 games of 5 min wait times - even though it was your game that failed to notify me that game had crashed on load screen which resulted in me missing 10 mins of a 42 min game because of it.\r\n\r\nAnd once again your game crashed mid game, forcing me to restart my PC which resulted in me being out of game for about 7 mins, and now i have 5 games of a 10 MINUTE ban!!! I played before the crash and after it, so what is your problem!? I wanted to play the game, it was your game not letting me!!\r\n\r\nI have been here playing every damn minute for every damn game for the last 3-4 years and you ban me because one game crashed? GG Riot, real good system you have in place...\r\n\r\nThink its time to look into DoTA 2 - its a joke how you a treating a loyal customer and a player well received by the public with my collection of every colour ribbon.","replies":[]}
