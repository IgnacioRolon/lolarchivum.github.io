I also watched a lot of LCS over the years, so can assist you with information on building a team comp/shot calling if required.\r\n\r\nI also have a working mic.\r\n\r\nHope to hear from you soon.","replies":[{"poster":"Clever Girl x","date":"2016-10-02T09:45:09.183+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey man I added you.
