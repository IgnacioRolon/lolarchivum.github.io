If you were placed the same that makes you the minority. Your unranked friend was S5 because fresh ranked accounts start with S4~ mmr. Placement is based on your individual mmr more than what games you won/lost in placements.","replies":[{"poster":"Jabakon","date":"2018-01-25T05:23:04.063+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"but he did well in most of his placements, my friend who got silver 5 even said you were better than me during the game, is it just an unfortunate calculation?","replies":[{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2018-01-25T05:48:22.029+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Your fresh friends mmr would have been S4~ when he started placements, whereas you other friend after the soft reset would have been B4~. Lose a little mmr over placements and friend 1 ends up S5 and friend 2 ends up B5. The determining factor here is that your other friend ended last season in B2.","replies":[{"poster":"Jabakon","date":"2018-01-28T22:48:25.430+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"alright thanks that clears it up","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}
