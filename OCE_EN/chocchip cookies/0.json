My friend was playing Vi Jungle. As he went to gank we got counterganked against Xin. I ulted him just before he died, after he had &#039;respawned&#039; with my ult, he ulted Xin, He went towards Xin, and as he reached him the Xin stopped moving, however the animation for the Vi ult connecting with Xin didn&#039;t work. He looked as if he stopped moving, I believe it might just be the animation.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\nChocChip Cookies","replies":[{"poster":"SephirothSG","date":"2016-02-17T02:13:55.439+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey there,\n\nThis board is for Help & Support regarding technical issues with the game.\n\nThe best place to post this would be over on the NA boards [Report a Bug section](http://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/bug-report), before posting please read [this thread](http://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/bug-report/3mQGBEjA-how-to-report-a-game-bug) on how to post a proper bug report.","replies":[]}]}
