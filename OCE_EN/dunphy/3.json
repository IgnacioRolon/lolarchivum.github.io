I am able to play only Lulu ( AD/Sup ), Lux ( AP/Sup), Ahri (AP) and probably Soraka and janna as a supporter. If you are still looking for someone to finish the quest, PLZ add me on your friendlist.\r\n\r\nI know I am still not Level 30, but believe it would be okay as I have Keystone mastery\r\n\r\nThank you :)\r\nDunphy","replies":[]}
