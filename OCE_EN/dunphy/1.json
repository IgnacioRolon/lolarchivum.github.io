I am able to play only  **Lulu ( AD/Sup ), Lux ( AP/Sup), Ahri (AP) and probably Soraka and janna as a supporter**. If you are still looking for someone to finish the quest, PLZ add me on your friendlist. \n\nI know I am still not Level 30, but believe it would be okay as I have Keystone mastery\n\nThank you :)\nDunphy","replies":[]}
