So Nidalee tries to gank its unsuccessful and riven doesn&#039;t say anything ( I believe, I was bot so I wasn&#039;t exactly paying attention to top) She goes back to lane and attempts to duel Rengar, she dies. So she says shes going afk, she sells all her items and doesnt move for a couple mins then she proceeds to walk down bot and just intentionally feed. I reported her but I don&#039;t believe she will be punished because I went through her match history and she has a history of intentionally feeding judging by her scores. And the worst thing is if you took away her deaths from the overall score we would have been winning in kills for most of the game which is a shame.\r\n\r\nDuring the game she also said it was her smurf and so she didn&#039;t care if she got banned. After the game I added her and she wanted to 1v1, we both played thresh and I beat her but she continued to abuse me and talk bout her gold 1 smurf which was plat preseason and how she hates &#039;bronze sh**cu**s&#039;\r\n\r\nI don&#039;t have any proof but her Summoner name is &#039;U r e z&#039;. I do have a screenshot of her admitting she fed before the 1v1.\r\n\r\nRiot please ban this account aswell as their smurf.","replies":[{"poster":"HORSE OF FORCE","date":"2015-04-10T08:49:24.999+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":">1v1\n\n[Read this](http://boards.oce.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/announcements/BjArMH2B-boards-universal-rules) before posting.
