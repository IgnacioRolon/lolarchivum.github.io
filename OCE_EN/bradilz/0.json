Mess around however you like with that last one. Frozen Mallet is probably a good option, haven't tried it yet tho!\n\nBlack Cleaver though is almost always first buy. AD, CDR, Armour Shred, HP and movespeed. Everything Kled wants in one item.\nSterak's Gage/Maw + Guardian Angel are also **INCREDIBLE** items on him and I recommend squeezing them into his build wherever you can. They give you plenty of opportunity to get Skaarl back after you've been dismounted and makes you insanely hard to kill. I've won a lot of fights because of them :')","replies":[]}]}
