I know this for a fact because I lost two games for one ark of mine. Which I'm quite annoyed about because for one thing I hadn' t lost a provisional yet, we were winning and I was deathless and then had a black out. Couldn't get back on League for a day. Then found out I had lost two provisionals for the one. Shame.","replies":[]}]}
