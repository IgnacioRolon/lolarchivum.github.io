People on my team and the enemy team have reported me for being afk, also reporting me for being toxic since i was trying to tell them that i disconnected in the loading screen. It wont be a big surprise if i get banned since most of the league community is toxic and they don't care about others. So please reset the strikes i got or whatever because i honestly don't deserve them and i don't have the right to be banned off League. I hope that a Staff member reads this or if you know one please let them know! Thanks for reading. :)","replies":[{"poster":"HORSE OF FORCE","date":"2015-01-04T10:40:30.172+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":">i don't have the right to be banned off League\n\nHave you read the EULA?\n\nAnyway, you shouldn't get banned for something like this. You don't get a leave marker if your game crashes and you rejoin within ten minutes. If people are reporting you, then it wouldn't be for much, considering you haven't really done anything bad, unless you're disconnecting again after reconnecting.\n\nBy any chance does this have to do with Yasuo?","replies":[]}]}
