Only to see Battlecast Prime Cho'Gath in game... I made a mistake. I understand Gentleman Cho is a very old legendary skin but if you could please do a rework with his visual model/jokes etc. I love the voice though Battlecast prime seems much better than gentleman cho, i have some ideas for the new Gentleman Cho. /dance (sits on armchair and drinks wine in front of fireplace) /joke (animations) as well as giving him a better visual. I want my money worth and thanks if you read this. {{champion:31}}","replies":[{"poster":"HellsHaven","date":"2015-03-20T05:16:05.796+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"hay i thought gentleman cho ult could be less violent.(not that my mummy say so) its just that his bloody as fuck ult just makes me uncomfortable with that skin since he is meant to be a gentleman tho im fine with his deafault skin {{champion:31}}  as this looks like it will be a very bloody and gory champion. {{champion:432}} is fat","replies":[]},{"poster":"Crusader charlie","date":"2015-03-16T22:07:39.220+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"ding ding ding, time for a visual update. pretty sure cho is rather limited in terms of how good he can be because even with better textures, his in game model is really clunky and.. well boxy.\n\nit would be nice to see a champ I like so much to be made shiny again","replies":[]},{"poster":"WhisperPan","date":"2015-03-13T06:42:28.252+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I thought they did a visual rework this patch or last patch.
