We can sort out which roles and champions we&#039;re all good at and build an awesome team comp together and hopefully climb a lot easier. I at least want to reach Silver V before the season ends! :3\n\nI&#039;ve been playing league for maybe a year+ now and only recently have I thought about getting into ranked more seriously. I main mid and support (mostly kat and naut), I can play top and jungle too. I&#039;m not so great with ADC but I can practice that in norms and customs. So basically, I&#039;m looking for anyone who can top, mid, jungle and adc :3 Since I know a lot of people out there hate playing support, I&#039;d gladly fill that role in but would like mid here and there too. Currently B3, which is why I&#039;m finding it so difficult to climb on my own. \n\nI can usually play after 5 - 6pm on Mondays - Thursdays and anytime on Fridays - Sundays if nothings going on. Let me know which roles you main, rank isn&#039;t necessary since I mean cmon I&#039;m bronze 3.

I'm Gold V at present (stopped cause I mostly just wanted the rewards) and mostly want a team to get the ward skin, but I'd be happy to play with you. My only rule is if it's not fun I won't play :) \n\nI've been playing for three years now (boy has it really been that long), first year seriously playing ranked though and I gotta tell you, ranked doesn't get much better, so long as you don't get unfortunately stuck in B5 the toxic doesn't get much better/worse (though the higher you go the better the skill at least....generally) so teams are a great alternative. My advice, remember it's a game and you're there to have fun (but still take it a little more seriously than norms), and especially if you start this late, don't expect to get very far before season ends, just consider it an experience in getting better at the game :)","replies":[]},{"poster":"Aidan7787","date":"2015-10-29T12:48:35.849+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Add me bro, I play all lanes accept support.
