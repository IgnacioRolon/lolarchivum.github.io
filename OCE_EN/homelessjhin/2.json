Sorry you had to play with someone like that :( \n\nIf you're not happy with how the report system dealt with your report though, I recommend you submit a Riot Support Ticket [here](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/requests/new).\n\nThe best category to use is:\n\n**_\"I want to report abusive behavior, cheating, or a malicious link\"_**","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"HomelessJhin","date":"2019-11-02T19:08:34.545+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"i was probably a toxic asshole back then. chances are i still could be. but hey, im not a teenager and have a job so fuck it. it is what it is. id rather have a beer and hit the rift than waste peoples time trying to have shitty little arguments on the internet. probably just from years on playing xbox live back in the day","replies":[]},{"poster":"Essembie","date":"2017-12-30T22:09:36.083+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"if that is all you got booted for, that sucks balls. \n\nsuspect there may be more to the story though.","replies":[]},{"poster":"laz464","date":"2017-12-22T11:28:01.814+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"i wish i could get a chat ban instead of a 14 fucking day suspension. be so much better than a 14day ban rather go back to nah where u could say anything and it was 3 chat bans then 1 day ban instead of 14day ban and then probably perma.","replies":[{"poster":"cuckboii","date":"2017-12-22T11:41:51.337+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Same. Instead of getting chat restricted, they suspended me instead. \nIf I'd been chat restricted, I would've thought \"oh yeah, I better reform\". \nBut now I'm thinking \"what the fuck, Riot?\"\n\nI think they should have 1 chat ban allowance per month, then a 14 day ban, 28 day ban, a 3 month ban, then a permaban.\nUpon unbanning there should be an instaban cooldown on the account, starting at the 14 day ban it should be 7 days, 14 days, 28 days then three months.\n\n There should also be more options to apply to be unbanned since the automated punishments could screw it up.\n\nI feel like this would be literally perfect for league or any multiplayer game. It would keep the most toxic accounts out of action but still seem very kind.","replies":[{"poster":"laz464","date":"2018-01-21T07:31:54.362+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"exactly","replies":[]}]}]}]}
