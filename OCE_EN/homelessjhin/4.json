You are judged by your actions alone, and in this case they were toxic.\n\nIf you want to know what you should do now, I recommend you focus on just communicating only essential information through the chat. The whole point of a chat restriction is to give you an opportunity to learn self control when situations get tense. Calling people \"retards\" and being \"slightly aggressive\" doesn't help you win games and just makes the game less enjoyable for everyone else, therefore you should avoid it at all costs.\n\nGood luck with your reforming, lemme know if you have any questions :D","replies":[{"poster":"HomelessJhin","date":"2017-09-25T23:54:29.436+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"yeah dude, agree to every point there. just super tilted and being childish at the time aye. deserved the chat ban. still on that hon grind now, lvl2 stylin ;)","replies":[{"poster":"Tele","date":"2017-09-26T02:17:01.854+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Good on ya' :D\n\n{{sticker:slayer-pantheon-thumbs}}","replies":[]}]}]}]}
