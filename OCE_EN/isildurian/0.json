If you are playing champions that you enjoy you will find climbing to be a more fun and help you focus on your mentality on improving.\n\n---\n\nSpeaking of the main thing you want to focus on is improving your basic mechanics. Choose a part of your gameplay that you want to improve on, have it be csing, trading, positioning or etc and spend the next games focusing on getting better at that area. There are many great resources that will help you improve as well that you can look up, but I would suggest always have a look around in case you find conflicting opinions, then based through your own experiences make a judgement call as to which you think is correct.\n\nI personally would recommend through my own experience to check out this series of videos by unswlolsoc, starting off with his video about \"[The trading stance](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iko2tqmDpJQ)\". Let me know what you think and if this series helped you out.\n\n---\n\nAnother thing that can help is goals. Having a ranked goal to get to gold is good, but I would suggest setting a closer goal to your current rank. This way you can really see your improvement as you go up, and this will help your motivation towards climbing.\n\nAlong with this try to set a goal as to, as previous mentioned, what mechanics you want to get better at. If you set yourself these goals, this will help you track your improvement in your mechanics as well, letting you know what to focus on when, once you have gotten good enough for your elo in specific areas.\n\nAlways be looking to improve, eager to learn, willing to take advice and you will get to your goal elo.\n\n---\n\nTo answer your question about a person to play with, if you are interested I can play some normals with you some time and give you some pointers tailored to the areas that I think you should improve on. So feel free to send me a friend request if you are keen.\n\nI hope that this helps, if there is anything I can clarify on, or any other questions I can answer let me know, and good luck on your climb.\n\n~Elam","replies":[]}]}
