Its Friday night, I&#039;m going to chill and have fun.

If you think I sound like someone fun you can play with you&#039;re damn right!\r\n\r\nReply to this thread AND add me in game - I&#039;ll be checking the thread over the next 5 hours looking for my duo queue partner for the night.\r\n\r\nThat&#039;s right, you could be bronze and I can smurf duo queue with you for some easy wins and fun times, just post below!","replies":[{"poster":"TheQuantumGamer","date":"2015-12-11T13:50:32.048+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"M8 hit me up. you seem chill as.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Kayn Me Papi","date":"2015-12-11T03:29:15.482+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Sounds good to me {{sticker:slayer-pantheon-thumbs}}","replies":[]}]}
