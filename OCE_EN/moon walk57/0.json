Though, in order to get Alistar and Unchained Alistar you will need to contact support as it doesn't work for oce. You will be given the codes for Tristana/Garen and their skins to use in the store in-client. If you can find someone willing to give you the code you could also get Arcade MF and Riot Kayle for free and, if I'm not mistaken, any purchase of RP at an EB Games outlet will get you a code for Mad Scientist Ziggs, assuming they have some in stock (might have finished for all I know but you can ask). Hope this helps.","replies":[]},{"poster":"JasonWazza","date":"2014-11-29T16:28:42.879+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You just named the skins, google it, it can't be that hard to get them.","replies":[{"poster":"Jakiron","date":"2014-11-29T20:49:00.024+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Super helpful mango.\n\nTo be fair though you put as much effort into the help as op put into looking for the skins so I guess morally you're not entirely bankrupt. gg wp","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"SEKAI","date":"2014-11-29T16:24:27.251+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You need to follow/like/subscribe their page on Twitter to get Dreadknight Garen, Facebook for Riot Girl Tristana and Youtube for Unchained Alistar.\n\nI think.\n\nNot sure if it's only the skin or it also gives out the champ for you, so just to be sure, you get the champs first before you acquire the free skins.","replies":[{"poster":"Jakiron","date":"2014-11-29T20:45:56.715+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Pretty sure it unlocks the champ if you don't have it.\n\nI know some of them do, not sure if they all do.\n\nFairly certain it tells you before you get the code.\n\n[Riot Girl Tristana](https://www.facebook.com/LeagueOfLegendsOceania?sk=app_174961479209942&brandloc=DISABLE&app_data=chk-547a2f096a2ac)\n\n[Dreadknight Garen](http://oce.leagueoflegends.com/en/news/community/promotion/come-and-join-us-social-media)\n\nafaik for Unchained Alistar you have to contact support.","replies":[]}]}]}
