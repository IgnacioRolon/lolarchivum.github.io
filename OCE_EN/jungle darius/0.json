We already found a great place to host it at, basically everything was taken care of, however, something we just now realised is: is it allowed to even do this? Do we have to ask permission by Riot?\r\nIf it is allowed, is there an option (since it's all LAN) to utilise a local server so the lag is minimized?\r\nI hope someone can answer this!\r\nSincerely,\r\nAll the members of the Cold One crew.","replies":[{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2019-07-18T12:33:29.919+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> Is it allowed/do we have to ask permission?\n\nAbsolutely and no. It sounds like you're running in EUW so I ran it by the volunteers over there, and they confirmed there are no restrictions on privately run tournaments. About the only thing that might run you into trouble there is if you advertise it as an official Riot tournament and/or use the Riot logo. So long as you make it clear it's a community tournament, you're good to go!\n\n> Is there an option (since it's all LAN) to utilise a local server?\n\nThe short answer is no. The longer answer is things like worlds and the big Riot run tournaments like MSI, All Stars etc. are generally the only ones that get access to the tournament realm of servers. If you're in the same place, then your ping all should be the same, so you at least still get that equalising factor.\n\n___\n\nIf you want any more info, I'd recommend posting on the EUW boards as the people there will likely have more region specific answers for you :)","replies":[]}]}
