It would be much much longer if they saved the allocated roles of a summoner until he she next logs on. eventually you would end up with a small percentage of auto fills over the majority.\nI hope i have explained this clearly.","replies":[{"poster":"Mortis Ex","date":"2017-01-12T08:50:13.835+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=ThatsBS,realm=OCE,application-id=Ntey9fRZ,discussion-id=WsfAlhOQ,comment-id=00000000000000000000,timestamp=2017-01-11T14:09:13.306+0000)\n>\n> Thats my point, the waiting to find the autofill.

If you wish to take advantage of your earned autofill protection then you may have to wait longer. If you prefer not to wait then you can fill. The point is that you \"earned\" the autofill protection. \nThe biggest bonus to this would be supports would be a desired duo partner and get more recognition as being team players rather than a role everyone hates being filled to for the second time in a row because you earned protection on your last/only game of the night. \n3.50 isnt very long for an estimated queue time and yet they already activate autofill.

Putting it into practice would create longer que times (That you have eluded to and are prepared to wait longer for), but is the whole community? \n\nSure they might be, but what is an acceptable length of time?  I won't even mention the low pool of players at off peek times. \n\nI'm confident riot would have already looked into it and it not been able to ensure that your theory is feasible.","replies":[{"poster":"Neosinf","date":"2017-01-15T12:06:38.999+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Having no autofill protection is like running out of condoms.\n\nYou want to go in but the risk...\n\nAll the guy is saying is that he opens his drawer and finds he's out more often then he likes.\n\nHe doesn't mind waiting for a new box to arrive if it means he can have some safe fun.\n\nBut you're telling him that he should just get in there so that everyone has a chance to enjoy.\n\nWell he doesn't enjoy going to war without a helmet.

Some players might think this is great but there seems to be a substantial portion of the community who disagrees, like I do. We are not talking about a game that only goes for a few mins. When you queue for a game of league you have to be willing to set aside in excess of 1 hour, a few mins for queue, a few mins for champ selection, a few mins for loading and then anywhere upwards of 20 mins for a game ( very rarely you see a game go less than 20 mins but often they will go for >30). \n\n\"Thats my point, the waiting to find the autofill. It would be much much longer if they saved the allocated roles of a summoner until he she next logs on. eventually you would end up with a small percentage of auto fills over the majority.\"\n\nYou are proposing a theory that this would result in less autofills which I totally agree with. \nMy theory is that in response to this, the community would quickly adapt and see an increase in the roles that people are not currently playing, for the reason they want to get into a game faster, and as less supports in particular would be throwing tantrums about being autofilled which would result in a healthier and happier community.\n\nAnd the \"I dont want to autofill\" button could have a timeout of say 10 mins or so which is generally around the time people start getting pretty antsy about the delay, or have the game prioritise people who dont use the button over people that do in matchmaking, or have some very small reward for people who fill or main support, and potentially disable it at very, very off peak times, but not anywhere as readily as it is right now.\n\nRight now there are many games with people throwing tantrums about getting filled and making all sorts of threats of feeding etc in champion select if people wont swap, picking troll sups and taking farm, not buying any sup items and not even trying to ward, basically just playing mid or top stuck in a lane with someone else who they ignore or troll. Chat logs from lobby dont seem to be recorded so they can make all sorts of toxic threats and hurl abuse around and then just go silent in game and troll away and as long as they dont actually feed or abuse anyone in the game they get off scot free. \n\nMy point is, autofill in lower elo seems to be much more counter productive than helpful a lot of the time. In high elo with a much smaller pool people recognize each other and generally work together to create a team with the best chance at winning but in lower elo it just seems to encourage more trouble than it solves. If the queue is popping within a few mins and people are getting autofilled then I dont think it is doing its job properly.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Neosinf","date":"2017-01-12T09:01:59.416+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Autofill is an evil entity\n\nAutofill is the other team's sixth player\n\nAutofill is the hidden end game boss from Final Fantasy X-4: Summoner's Rift\n\nAutofill is a demon that feeds on the tears and rage of yasuo-only noobs\n\nAutofill was etched on the bullet that killed Harambe\n\n\nAre you really going to let this murderous, shmuck-faced spawn of matchmaking efficiency defeat you?\n\n\nPICK UP YOUR **** SWORD SOLDIER (or wand, seeing as you have to play support 1/2 games) AND BRING JUSTICE TO THE ROLES NO ONE WANTS!","replies":[]}]}
