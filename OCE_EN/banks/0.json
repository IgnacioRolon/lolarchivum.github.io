Again the only thing that works is restarting my PC, and then the game will run normally for 3-4 hours before the same problem occurs again. Please help.","replies":[{"poster":"hadoukenn","date":"2015-09-01T07:42:25.876+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Just started getting this problem today..
