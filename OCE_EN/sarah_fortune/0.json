It costs over 3000 BE to level up to lvl 6 on a champion. That&#039;s a whole 5 days of grinding just to upgrade my level 6 tokens. And then, I can&#039;t buy any champions. Please, give us BE after every match.","replies":[{"poster":"Donut Panic","date":"2017-11-08T11:45:42.858+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yeah it cost me 3900 BE to get level 7 Karma which was almost all of my BE, this is pretty silly.
