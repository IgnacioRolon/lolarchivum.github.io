I recently picked LoL back up and (finally) verified my email address, though it appears I can&#039;t transfer back to OCE. If I recall correctly, before I verified my email, the option to purchase a region transfer was still in the store, however it is no longer there, and I&#039;m stuck on NA. Is there any information on this? / A fix?","replies":[{"poster":"Wuks","date":"2017-10-23T14:11:12.456+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You're gonna have to hang in there for about another month.
