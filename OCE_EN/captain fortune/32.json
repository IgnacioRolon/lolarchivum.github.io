Also Gnar has a 46% win rate there are much better tanks to pick/learn then him right now.","replies":[{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2017-05-13T05:31:48.140+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"I think the idea isn't to swap to whoever is best in top lane atm but more to swap to champions that have skills transferable from the ADC role, hence the whole idea. Gnar is kinda obvious on that one, he's a true top laner but in lane has a lot of the same positioning and poke mechanics as ADCs do. Having not played Irelia I can't really say so *shrug* on that one.","replies":[{"poster":"Fitzky","date":"2017-05-13T06:12:36.930+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"But you can't transition your adc skills over to toplane when they are two completely different lanes, gnar is an half marksman half tank champion who barely needs to kite since you should almost be at full rage when you're engaging the enemy and he has a heavy slow and a leap in his kit to escape anyway. Even in his squishy form gnar still has a ton more health then any of the adcs since he still builds tank while adcs build full damage. This means gnar doesn't get caught out and die quickly like adcs do. In teamfights he should be the one engaging in his mega form so there is no marksman elements there. Gnar in my eyes isn't a half adc half tank champion, his large attack range and extra attack speed in squishy form is more to balance out the loss of health and AD he loses from not being in mega form. Therefore I think gnar has barely any adc elements to him. If you're moving to top lane, just learn the champs, Garen, Darius and Renekton are all fairly easy champs to play and probably require less effort then any adc champ.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"belquin","date":"2017-05-13T00:42:47.208+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Really awesome work Elam! Super informative and I definitely agree there are transferable skills. Keen to see what you recommend for Jungler lane swaps (given how different the role is!)","replies":[{"poster":"Captain Fortune","date":"2017-05-13T01:01:48.290+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thankyou! I am excited for the jungle part as well for the information it provides! **That is one thing I actually forgot to put in the main post, I won't be doing this series alone :D** Each part we are _hopefully_ having a guest that mains each role do a post for their respective roles with their unique advice, (along with input from the group of other 4 working on their parts) as for who they are, well I will leave that a surprise till they go live :P\n\nDoing it this way, not only are we sure that the information is accurate because we have people who play the roles daily talking about them, but it also brings together different members of the community and a sense of mystery as to who the next person is to continue the series. \n\n~Elam","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Pured","date":"2017-05-14T06:33:21.548+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I wish there was a transition from Bronze Diana to Challenger Diana version.","replies":[]},{"poster":"OutMagic","date":"2017-05-13T06:21:48.679+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Awesome Elam :D I'm a long time player but just noticed this and thought I'd up it, epic idea for you guys to do this C:","replies":[]}]}
