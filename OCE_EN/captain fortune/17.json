Or is her father completely unknown still?\nFinally, would Katarina fighting Garen or Jarvan, or Vayne fighting firecracker Kog'Maw make any sense at all?\nApparently not finally but are the Lunar Guardians and Lunar Empress Lux considered \"gods\"? Since Radiant Wukong is supposedly ascended, would he be able to let's say challenge lunar guardian nasus for his spot?

Whether those factions exist as independent nations or as distinct factions within a single nation is unclear. Considering the inspiration for the Lunar Revel Alternate Universe was taken from Asian culture (primarily East-Asian Culture, from what I can tell), you could attempt to take inspiration from Asian history in that respect, or perhaps try to explain it within the confines of what *is* defined within the lore (using some \"creative license\" to fill in the gaps).\n\n> Secondly, is Jarvan the prince of the Warring kingdom country/city, and if so does he have any relationships with Azir, who is the emperor?\n\nWith this, there doesn't seem to be any indication one way or the other within the lore. From what I can tell, it seems possible that Jarvin has no royal heritage (or perhaps no *known* royal heritage) and is simply a warrior who has become disenchanted with his duties, and left to seek greater challenges. Ultimately, you will probably need to take some \"creative license\" here and define an answer on your own (the important thing in doing that is having something that makes sense within the lore and the story being told).\n\n> Thirdly, since in Katarina's skin description she is said to be a princess, does that mean she is Warring kingdom Azir's daughter? Or is her father completely unknown still?\n\nThere doesn't seem to be any specific answer within the lore, though there are a few things to take note of. In Azir's lore, he's defined as an \"ageless ruler\", which would imply immortality (a trait that is not indicated for Katarina), who lives within \"his palace within the mountains\", where he has presumably resided for quite a long time (perhaps centuries). Personally, I doubt that there's any relation between the two within the confines of the Lunar Revel AU, and that it's more likely that Katarina is from a separate faction.\n\n> Finally, would Katarina fighting Garen or Jarvan, or Vayne fighting firecracker Kog'Maw make any sense at all?\n\nSo far as Katarina, Garen and Jarvin go, it seems that could be a likely possibility. The three are all defined as mighty warriors of their faction, with Jarvin even being defined as having \"peerless might\". Jarvin seeks only the \"worthiest opponents\", Katarina seeks to \"hunt the greatest heroes of the Warring Kingdoms\", and Garen fights at the behest of his lord Azir. It's possible that any combination of a fight between the three could occur.\n\nSo far as Vayne and Kog'Maw go, I'd have to doubt that under the \"confines\" of the lore. From what I can tell, Kog'Maw is a willing participant of the Lunar Revel festivities, and as such likely has some level of rapport with the people. Vayne still seems to possess the \"mission\" of hunting evil that she has within the \"standard\" LoL lore, and so she may not consider Kog'Maw to be a viable target. Though, with that said, it seems Kog'Maw still possesses the same \"devouring instinct\", which may give Vayne all the reason she needs to hunt him. Personally, though, I'd try to avoid such a \"confusing\" matter.\n\n> Apparently not finally but are the Lunar Guardians and Lunar Empress Lux considered \"gods\"? Since Radiant Wukong is supposedly ascended, would he be able to let's say challenge lunar guardian nasus for his spot? And is he allowed to win?\n\nThe lore for Lux does explicitly state she is a \"Demi-god\", so not a \"fully fledged\" god, but still very powerful. As for Nasus and Warwick, there are certainly reasonable indications that they possess a unique connection to Lux, as they were \"gifted to and raised with\" her, which could indicate that no others could fulfil the same \"needs\" (essentially, they'd be irreplaceable), as well as indication that they themselves are also Demi-Gods, or at least something close.\n\nMy understanding is that being \"Ascended\", as Wukong is, is essentially a step (or two) down from being a God (or, in this case, a Demi-god), so (personally) I'd say it's unlikely that Wukong would have the necessary power and abilities to defeat Nasus or Warwick, not to mention his shortcomings (such as his \"quick temper\" and \"impulsive nature\") which would *surely* be a detriment in such an endeavour. It's also possible that if he attempted to defeat one of them, and had some success, the other, and perhaps even Lux herself, would come to assist.","replies":[]}]}]}
