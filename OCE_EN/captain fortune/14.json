The prizes from this contest barely varied each other. A more appealing prize is obviously a bigger prize. As much I would love to be an active league of legends community member and contribute to this contest, I found that the prizes were not particularly worth clearing my schedule (or rather league time) in order to work on the artwork I had planned to submit, which is of course no fault but my own. However, to hold more contests there has to be incentive which for example could be when an event or skin line comes out. Does the heaviness of the prizes actually affect you as an employee?","replies":[{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2019-06-10T05:25:46.172+0000","up_votes":7,"down_votes":0,"body":"I think the key distinction you are missing is that we (the volunteers) *aren't* employees. An employee like Achenar had more resources to pull from for contests, where we as volunteers are much more limited.\n\nIdeally, people are entering these contests for the community and for a chance to practice and show off their stuff. The prizes are obviously an incentive, but they aren't the only reason that most people enter these.\n\nThe short version is yes, the heaviness of the prizes does affect us. The volunteers have internal support, but these contests are run by us, and are not something that Riot the entity is actively investing in. The Rioters that support us give up a good chunk of their *free* time to help us run these contests too.\n\nThat's not to say we can't run contests with bigger prizes, but we have a choice to make. \n\nWe can run contests more regularly to get people engaged, give more people overall a chance to get involved and to double down on the content release hype but have lesser prizes to support the frequency. \n\nOr we can run contests less often, fewer people get to participate, and each type of contest (FF, art, replay, etc) gets fewer rotations, but the winners (and only the winners) get a better prize experience.\n\nThere are pros and cons to both, and our plan is essentially to mix the two. Not all the contests we run will have mind-blowing prizes (and let's be honest a free skin for practicing a beloved hobby doesn't sound so bad), but we get to run these lower impact contests more often.","replies":[{"poster":"Khronix","date":"2019-06-13T07:33:43.097+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"That's a shame that Riot doesnt invest in the community who continue to create awesome fanart for their game. I remember back when prizes was something like 10k rp for first place which sounds like a lot but in reality its just digital in-game currency which you could argue is a potential loss for Riot but its something that they have an infinite supply of which is basically pixels as opposed to the creators time. There's some standout quality fanart that would cost not to put a specific price on it, but somewhere in the hundreds if you go by commission prices. That's not to say that people only enter for the prizes but it just makes their time and effort all the more worth it. I don't mean to sound like a douche about it but I think I'm not alone with an opinion like this. It's somewhat put me off entering for the longest time now and I've noticed that a lot of previous winners have stopped entering in the recent years. From an artists perspective its kinda like the free or cheap art argument where you could say its practicing your hobby and potentially getting exposure and a bit of money as a bonus but yea that never ends well haha.","replies":[{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2019-06-13T14:18:03.156+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Believe me, I understand, and I'd love to give out bigger prizes, but like I said we have to consider the trade-off. Running contests less often but with bigger prizes means less people overall get to participate, and the participants far outweigh the winners numbers wise. \n\nHaving more appealing prizes would draw more participation, but we'd get less variety in our types of contests. Those who enter fanfic contests may only get a contest every 1.5-2 years instead of 1-2 a year etc.\n\nI'm of the mind that more opportunities for participation beats out the bigger win, but we're open to feedback.","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Canc","date":"2019-06-07T09:41:36.858+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"nice, I didn't enter for the prize. I just love to be part/support my region/community. I know how much 4-win ex boost are given out to various small event for participation, would that be consider for art contest participation as well? - The gallery post indicated 'eligible entries' assume the trolling ones are filtered out, either that or perhaps top 50 like previously ran artamathon are given xp boost?","replies":[{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2019-06-07T10:16:59.970+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"Eligible entries just means all valid entries, so ones that didn't break any rules.\n\nEXP boosts is certainly something we can look into, but there are pitfalls there too. If the barrier of entry is too low you'll have people who spend 5 minutes in paint just to get the participation prize, but if it's too high then an EXP boost really isn't much to offer those players who really put in the effort.\n\nThere's also the fact we can't really gauge the effort involved with contests like these. For a professional artist an entry to the quality of our winners might only take a few hours, but for someone really trying to improve and taking their time on it might take days. Then you have the whole quality vs effort argument with prizing and it all turns into a slippery slope.\n\nCertainly the shortlists will vary in length (and doing two tiers of shortlisting may also be an option) based on the depth of the contests and what resources we have available at the time. Being volunteer-run contests we don't have the kind of resources that Achenar had, especially when it came to sponsored contests, but we still love running them and the community engagement they generate.\n\ntl;dr - Nothing is off the table, but we're pretty heavily limited resource wise.","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Canc","date":"2019-06-05T07:28:01.774+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"well, mine didn't make it, can I at least link it here to be part of this post? \n\nMy entry: Battle Academia Lee Sin https://www.artstation.com/artwork/8lOxDO","replies":[{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2019-06-05T08:52:05.887+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"There will be a gallery post going up with all the eligible submissions but we rushed the results announce to get prizes out in time for people to buy bundles and spend tokens before they expire :)","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"VVhizza","date":"2019-06-06T10:52:37.925+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thanks for the mention! \n\nYuteki nailed it!
