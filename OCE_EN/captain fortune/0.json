Thanks to the on-hit passive on her W, Top Neeko may work in certain matchups. APC Neeko could also work thanks to this (if APC Ori works in high Challenger, why shouldn't APC Neeko work?).\n\nPersonally, I'll be playing her in the Jungle/Mid. Her Q bounces on large monsters and her W (both active and passive) works on them too. Will just need to practice her clears a bit.\n\nAs for runes, I guess it's just dependent on playstyle, but I'd either go Electrocute (very easy to land with an E + 2 bounces of her Q) or Dark Harvest (making her Ult even more of a nuke).\n\nThat said, I've seen people talking about playing her full AD and mimicking an ADC... but that's mostly for fun.\n\nI also think she'll be one of those champions that can have several viable build paths (like an AP one-shot build, Nashor's AS/On-Hit build, Tankier CC spambot, utility mage, etc.).\n\n**Questions:**\n\n* How does her ult work with transformation champions? Does she turn into whatever form they were in when she clicked the portrait? Does she switch forms whenever the champion she's copying switches forms?\n\n* How does this work with Kayn? If she takes Kayn's form, and then he goes into Blue/Red will she automatically turn?\n\n* What about post-6 Evelynn? Will she look like a regular pre-6 Eve? Does she look like the demon form, just without stealth?\n\n* How about Jayce, with his hammer forms?\n\n* Does she default to picking Jinx's minigun, or does it depend on what Jinx has when she switches to her?\n\n* If an enemy champion clicks on her while transformed, does it display her items/stats or the teammate she's copying?\n\n* How does Zhonya's work with her ult? Does the stasis not work? Does the ult cancel? Does she still do her ult, albeit untargetable?","replies":[]},{"poster":"XD haha","date":"2018-12-05T16:26:44.464+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I don't think the uses of her passive are limited to tricking the enemy team. Doesn't she also get ad/movement speed stats as well? So she should be able to copy a higher ad teammate when farming/ leashing, and then switch to a higher movement speed teammate for moving around the map.","replies":[]},{"poster":"jadelink","date":"2018-11-22T11:50:49.144+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I suspect from the look of her it will be 'she is played everywhere with a vast banrate and low winrate', for a week or so.  Smart people will realise she has stupid oneshot potential, and the game is still all about instant burst.  \n\nEventually the nerfs will start, possibly later than usual due to pro play being delayed (and how broken she is when played well is masked by the awfulness of buttonmashing random players).  After half a dozen rounds of nerfs she will reach the annoying obscurity enjoyed by bad reworks who got overloaded damage + mobility, like Akali and Irelia.  Broken in pro/high elo main hands, useless for anyone else, and frequently banned.  Playable in a wide variety of roles by the .01% who can actually play them.","replies":[]}]}
