I can't wait to see how this Zac rework turns out.\n\nOne thing I am concerned about however is the display of CC. While at first it may seem a good idea, I feel like this will be almost OP for champions like Gangplank with his oranges and ADCs who build Merc Scimiitar. These kind of abilities and items require impeccable timing, and if used by a good player, can protect them from an otherwise devastating attack, or help them run from enemies in a montage worthy chase. But now, these epic chases, won't be so epic, as any player can notice a display above their characters head and use Scimitar. What separates the good gangplanks and the great adc's from the average ones, is being able to almost instantly react to cc and use the item or (in gangplanks case) eat his oranges. At first glance it seems like a good idea, but I feel this will really detract from the fun of playing adc (and gangplank).\n\nApart from that, this mid-season update looks awesome. Good job to the developers behind it at riot, and I look forward to next patch (or the one after, if riot wanna be difficult and make us wait an eternity)  when I can play it.","replies":[{"poster":"Tele","date":"2017-04-20T02:40:24.963+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Damn didn't think about that on Gangplank, he's probably significantly stronger now. I know in low elos you could bait an early orange as Thresh if you played properly, but that's probably not possible anymore :( \n\nI think for ADC it's a worthy trade off though. Sure, plays like [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1D7jD7aySNw) won't be as impressive, but ADC will get a little bit of love in low elo without affecting high elo much, which is a welcome change IMO.","replies":[{"poster":"Miicka","date":"2017-04-20T12:16:47.548+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You make a good point.

Otherwise not much has changed.\n\nSejuani ult got mega nerfed and I'm just not seeing that power redistributed into the rest of her kit, beyond her passive everything else is less powerful or more team reliant. I've been maining Sej since 2012 and already had to live through one rework, we'll see if I can get a handle on this version as well but one thing is for certain: she'll only be able to carry through CC now rather than damage. More like a pure Tank less like a Fighter, which does mean she needs to work around her team or vice versa, less self reliant.\n\nZac has the most potential to be more powerful in skilled hands, but his Q and Ult appear very easy to mess up. (Q the wrong champs/miss, ult the wrong champs/mistime/counterplayable by giving enemy tanks a free trip into your backline if they bet you'll make a bounce backwards and they jump in your ult)","replies":[{"poster":"Captain Fortune","date":"2017-04-20T04:30:57.437+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I was having similar feelings about the skill cap increasing on the champions as well, and the exact same with the Maokai ult.\n\nHowever the thing I am excited about with these changes is that with the skill caps being increased it makes playing these champions especially in team fights a lot more 'mirco' intensive. IMO this possibly leads to helping team fights for tanks in a sense being less 'stale' and more reactive depending on how the game is going. Helping get to the point of no game being the same and making players adapt to their situation more.\n\nTo expand on this with the old Maokai, with no offense to current Maokai players in saying this but it just seems like you would have a lot more to think about and keep track of in a team fight with your teams positioning and how you want to use your abilities the best you can to help your team win the fight. Similar with Zac as well.\n\n---\n\nIf I may ask being a Sejuani main yourself currently, with these changes in mind moving away from exactly the thoughts on how 'strong' it is, how much do you think these changes impact how 'unqiue' she is? Being that in champion select if you were wanting to pick a jungler for your team do you think this puts her in a position where she fits a more unqiue role in the team or can be substituted out with others easily based on kit?\n\n_This mainly refers to competitive/high elo play, but also could be taken in the context of all elos solo queue as well._\n\n---\n\nLet me know what you think, I am curious your thoughts.\n\n~Elam","replies":[{"poster":"Gehirn","date":"2017-04-20T05:24:04.470+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"On Sejuani, the one thing that stands out as unique is her E passive stacking with _allied melee champions_. That will be a main decision driver in champ select. There is a realistic chance that you are the only melee on your team sometimes, making her a less viable pick.\n\nI feel like she has been made more unique in that regard, but only because she has been forced further into a niche. She would have to be better at working with allied melee champions than other tank AP junglers to justify picking her. Is that the case? I don't know yet.\n\nHer previous(current) ultimate was the easiest decision point for her: \"Do I want long range AOE non-committal hard CC for engage? Yes > pick Sejuani\".\n\nNow that's not the case, it is no where near as reliable a hard engage tool. She must now use her passive cc reduction to close the gap for it to be as reliable, as well as rely on her team to quickly follow up on ulted enemies because all but one are now merely slowed, not stunned - plenty of space and time for them to escape. Hell, even for a disengage ult you now pick Maokai instead.\n\nShe basically has a more damaging Braum passive on her E assuming she hits the targeted stun and AA portion, but I don't believe this is a power upgrade from her previous E. It requires far more team co-ordination and a certain team comp. If I wanted a stacking stun, I could just get Braum on my team for a similar effect that requires less decision making for my allies because I can choose to mark a single target for them to co-ordinate on. But of course we're not talking about Support picks here.\nPreviously it was a long range AOE heavy slow that was fairly easy to apply _without_ relying on your team's help. Again this isn't supposed to be about strength, but I'm not sure why I would pick her for her E unless I wanted my team to focus on locking down and killing a diver or assassin when they go for my carry. This sort of goes against her \"charging in\" fantasy though as you're just peeling for your backline by anticipating an enemy dive.\n\nHer W is just a frost passive stacker with lower damage than current, her Q is the same. While I don't think there is a champ that does what new Sej does, I'm not sure it's needed. If old Sej was in the game alongside new Sej, then old Sej would be the \"better\" champ.\n\nThis is all an \"on paper\" analysis though. I'll have to play her to find her new strengths and figure out if they fill a smaller niche but do it better, or if she's just weaker while also being less pickable in general.\n\nEdit: I should note that her new clear speed and sustain will also determine if she is worth picking over other AP Tank junglers, as she has struggled with her first clear since early last year.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Maraudaur","date":"2017-04-20T01:37:07.361+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Wow this looks amazing!\n\nThe two things I am most excited about are actually all the UI changes and the Rift Herald.

As using it early could lose you pressure not only in the bottom side of the map, but the top side towards Rift Herald as well if they want to roam away from top. Do you think this could have an impact on summoner spell choices or the pacing of the game with this change?\n\n~Elam","replies":[{"poster":"Maraudaur","date":"2017-04-20T04:58:28.927+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I think it opens up aggressive summoners top a lot more as winning top and getting Rift can play a larger part on winning the game.
