Can she do a full recall while in true invisibility? Just W, expect her to be there when the W fades, but *poof!* she's gone?\n\nWhat about enhanced recall (ie. Herald/Baron)? What about TP? Is the TP swirl still visible if you're standing close enough (such as how you can see TP swirls even in unwarded brushes), or is it also masked? If so, it could make for some nifty TP plays where the laner doesn't even ping the TP since they're thinking she's just faffing around in stealth.\n\nDoes her recall animation change while stealthed (like Eve)?\n\n(*Also, how do you do all that formatting on the Boards? Like the clickable buttons, or your profile icons + description, or having Akali in the header.

It would be super call if her recall changed while she was stealthed though I am unsure if this is currently a thing.\n\n---\n\n_RE: How do we do all the cool formatting._\nAs boards volunteers, we get access to additional tools to create discussions such as this using coding (HTML and CSS), this is currently not a feature for everyone, however, if this is something that you are interested in you could always make your way up to becoming a boards volunteer yourself! \n\nSimply pick which type of volunteer you want to be, Instructor, Emissary or Wrenchman and start making your way towards it by helping out in those areas of the boards, we will keep our eye out.\n\n{{sticker:sg-ahri-2}}","replies":[{"poster":"TTL Rem","date":"2018-07-24T09:18:22.981+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Ooh! Thankles very much <3\n\nJust an additional thing: does LoL performance affect chances of being a Boards volunteer? Ie. Honour Level 0/1, or being Bronze V but going for Instructor?","replies":[{"poster":"Captain Fortune","date":"2018-07-24T10:53:40.699+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey TTL Rem, got around to updating the PBE and I have answers to your questions.\n\n[**Can Akali Recall while in her shroud? (click me)**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MmQZfnFje1c&feature=youtu.be)\n\nSadly she cannot recall while invisible as, as soon as she starts channelling the recall effect she gets revealed, a bit of a bummer but hey it makes sense!\n\n---\n\n[**Can Akali TP while in her shroud? (click me)**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8y3yB8Qy0ME&feature=youtu.be)\n\nThis one actually had some really interesting effects such as finding out that for the first cast of TP yes you get revealed, but after about a second you actually go invisible again! Which means this could lead to some outplay potential, but probably not as smooth as what you are after.\n\n---\n\n**Does Rank and Honour Level affect being a volunteer**\n\nRank never effected being a volunteer, some of the best coaches in the world are actually quite low ranks as they spend so much time analyzing the game as opposed to playing it, so don't see that as something that would hold you back. As for Honour level, this isn't something we have discussed in the past, let me get back to you on this!\n\nHope these help!\n\n~ Elam","replies":[{"poster":"TTL Rem","date":"2018-07-24T11:01:59.856+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Awesome!
