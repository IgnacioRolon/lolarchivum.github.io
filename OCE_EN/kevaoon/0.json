It will arrive in about 1-2 days.&quot;. We filled out a form which included our address, name and phone number and we went on to watching the event. Its been about a week now and we still have not received our showbags. Can anyone help?","replies":[{"poster":"Crunch","date":"2015-12-04T05:26:28.322+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hi SuperMini0n,\nMy name is Cameron \"Crunch\" and I was helping to run the event. I am very sorry to hear the bags have not been distributed to you yet after the hiccup with customs last Saturday. I will be following up with the Hoyts staff as they have control/responsibility for the postage and handling of them. I'll also see what I can do regarding skin codes for you as I know this is a huge selling point of attending these viewing parties. \n\nI sincerely apologize for the lack of communication here and regardless of the lack of *swag* on the day I hope you enjoyed the event! There will be a clearer line of communication between Riot/Hoyts/Myself to ensure that this error does not occur again. \n\nReally hoping they arrive for you soon!\nCrunch","replies":[{"poster":"Kevaoon","date":"2015-12-06T03:48:24.442+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thanks for the help!","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Maraudaur","date":"2015-12-04T07:19:05.003+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey SuperMini0n,\n\nWe are working with HOYTS to get the swag bags sent out asap.
