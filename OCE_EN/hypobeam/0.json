I have improved a lot on my behavior lately, i have been doing anger management lessons and looking at myself now and comparing myself to back then, i can say that i have improved a lot as a person! i would really love to get back into the league of legends community once again and have a second chance as my behavior has changed drastically since then. at the moment i cannot show any results but for you to trust me with this second chance and accept me back into the community i can show you results! i would love to not completely quit this game and taking a massive break from it taught me a lot of things and i believe that i will not let you down!!","replies":[{"poster":"Neo89","date":"2016-07-27T13:45:00.266+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Seems there's a lot of unsupportive & arrogant fuks in the lol community, (in regards to things like 'self-improving' summoners).\n\nNice to see some empathy though.\n\nThose of you who want to be mean to those who are disadvantaged for any reason, should refrain from even posting.\n\nI won't bother to elaborate further....","replies":[]},{"poster":"JasonWazza","date":"2016-07-19T07:21:53.443+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"It's very possible that riot will not unlock your account, that said it may be worth making a new account and starting from scratch.","replies":[]},{"poster":"im a mushroom","date":"2016-07-26T04:44:29.453+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"denied!","replies":[]},{"poster":"ErÃ¸se","date":"2016-07-20T04:39:03.453+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Send a support ticket maybe","replies":[]},{"poster":"Prince Smashy","date":"2016-07-20T04:20:37.832+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I am pretty sure if the account got perm ban for more then 6 months, then that account get deleted from the database, which means that the account can't be retrieved again.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Iosua Bot","date":"2016-07-20T02:21:13.354+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Soz man.\nTime may have changed, you also have changed.\nBut your account will FOREVER be PERMANENTLY BANNED.\n\nStart from scratch man ;-;","replies":[]},{"poster":"Juuzuo Suzuya","date":"2016-07-19T07:31:42.488+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"seems like worth looking at but i doubt riot would unban the account as riot is riot. i don't think they have ever unbanned an account no matter if you used 100000$ and improved your behavior, checked into anger management or even do something so temporary and reflect on it.
