I carried the team back from the brink and despite having less deaths than the average player and more assists I only scored an A?\r\n\r\nhttps://i.imgur.com/YQGdjP6.jpg\r\n\r\nWhat exactly am I doing wrong with Ivern?","replies":[{"poster":"H F","date":"2018-04-13T12:37:39.234+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Could we lack of vision? You don't show game time, but could also be cs numbers that's low? What about towers and objectives, did you help with any of that? All this is taken into consideration.","replies":[{"poster":"Billy Tilly","date":"2018-04-14T01:56:15.967+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yea, I'm thinking now vision is probably exactly what it was. It sucks they got rid of the jungle item which provided vision!","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Devi","date":"2018-04-13T14:28:19.998+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I agree with H F. I would put it down to vision,counter jungling and objectives. This is my game earlier, I earned an S.\n\nhttps://imgur.com/ePuyj5S\nhttps://imgur.com/todjuzQ\n\n\nif someone is about to take a tower go help em push, or if the jungler is off doing random things take dragon/baron/herald. Make sure you buy vision wards and ward like crazy (preferably in the enemy jungle or around lanes that need it)\n\nAnd try not to die.\n\nI hope that helps. :3\n\nEdit: I also noticed you upgraded your jungle item, I wouldn't do that friendo, its kind of pointless doesn't work well for him you are better off buying another item on him in all honesty. Sell it once you have all the other things built but need one more item for full build. (its what i do) Its also quicker to snowball that way.","replies":[{"poster":"Billy Tilly","date":"2018-04-14T01:55:21.805+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Oh dang. Not bad at all. And I see what you mean. That makes sense actually. I'll give what you say a go and sell the jungle item and maybe replace it with an item that gives vision. Can't go wrong with extra vision.\n\nAnd I see that you gave me an add. Cheers. Ivern is fun as. It's time we rep the rift with him homeslice.","replies":[]}]}]}
