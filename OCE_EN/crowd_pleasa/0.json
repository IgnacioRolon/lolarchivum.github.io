It is a good idea for an item because it greatly boosts the laning ability of mana reliant champions such as jayce and ezreal. But it is usually never completed before laning is over, so usually tear is built instead. My idea is for it to have a new build path with a new item. Which behaves exactly like a vamp sceper but it returns mana instead. And the new essence reaver would be built from an essence scepter(working title), a vamp scepter and a pickaxe. This would also give a choice of what the player wants to buikd first( damage, hp sustain or mana sustain).","replies":[{"poster":"BarryButcher","date":"2015-06-06T04:16:44.689+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Essence Reaver costs too much for what it does. By the time you get enough money for it, you usually don't have mana problems anymore.\n\nI had a few ideas for it. Much like you, Pickaxe + Vamp is an obvious change they can make. Just reduce the AD, make it cheaper, might be a good \"snowballing\" item.\n\nWhat I also thought, was MAYBE, since they changed Blackcleaver, change Reaver to Brutuliser + Vamp. Take away some AD but adds amour pen.","replies":[{"poster":"McRuthless","date":"2015-06-06T21:27:59.890+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It originally did build from pickaxe + vamp with less AD/cost.
