I CANT PLAY THIS GAME ANYMORE, YOU'VE FUKED ME OVER.\n\nI uninstalled, that's how much it sucks and before I get told that I don't like change or change is good, stfu, Its not good when it makes you play like shit because you've been playing with the old hud for 3 years, I cant even ping on the screen anymore... I use to press and drag the icon above the mini map, it was so easy especially when I was already looking around the map.\n\nI feel like you did all this just to cater for the pro players, who would complain about not being able to see the corners of the game...","replies":[]}
