I have been playing for a few months now and had no issues with lag until around 40 days ago when I experienced extreme lag for no reason for many games in a row. I was \"leaver busted\" a few times too, due to drops in connection with the server. My partner and I both play on the same internet and he is having no troubles at all. I have upgraded my modem, had my computer looked at and updated and still I am having these issues. I have been unable to play a game through for over a month now and it is saddening me. I really enjoy your game but I really can not play at 4k ping. \r\n\r\nI note I am not the only one mentioning incredible ping in game. Others who were just in a game with next to no ping, are crippled by 800 ping this round. \r\n\r\nIs it a compatibility issue? Any ideas as to how to resolve this? I am going a little crazy here :P\r\n\r\nMany thanks,\r\nLyri","replies":[{"poster":"Axis of Struggle","date":"2014-11-28T13:26:55.714+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"are they lag spikes or frame rate crashes. My theory is leagues is have errors galore that lock up the game for less than a second and because the game locks up it \"registers\" as a latency issue.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Sackboy","date":"2014-11-28T05:40:18.140+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I haven't spiked once since playing on NA, maybe I have and I'm just used to playing on 300ping.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Arks","date":"2014-11-28T02:43:48.574+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I've been getting lag spikes very often, but they are like 200-400ms not extreme 1k+, my usually latency is around 30-40 and it makes it very hard to play most of the time when it will spike out of nowhere.","replies":[]}]}
