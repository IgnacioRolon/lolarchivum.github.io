We WIN the rank, but we didn&#039;t get any IP and rank point. Can you guys tell me what just happen, is it the server problem? And can we get out score back?","replies":[{"poster":"Gehirn","date":"2017-03-01T02:30:41.842+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thanks for the report. We just discovered an issue with Ranked LP gains not working correctly, we'll be disabling ranked while we investigate the cause. We probably won't be able to give the LP back but it should even out in your following games as your LP tries to catch up to your increased MMR from your win (which did correctly update)","replies":[]}]}
