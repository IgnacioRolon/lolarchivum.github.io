Random disconnects, game becoming unresponsive, cant click champions in champion select, Q-W-E-R keys not working. Game occasionally works properly but I&#039;ve been booted and forced to CTR+ALT+DEL too many times and now i&#039;m getting an AFK/Leaver warning.\r\n\r\nAnyone else experiencing this, also will this affect my account in any way?","replies":[{"poster":"HORSE OF FORCE","date":"2015-04-11T01:07:19.460+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Firstly, stop going into match-made games until you've fixed this.
