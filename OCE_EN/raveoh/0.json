How much effort actually went into creating this pathetic pile of shit game mode? A day? Less? Why would people want to play the shit champs that Riot have failed to balance properly? Its just infuriating...","replies":[{"poster":"GoldenTomat0","date":"2015-02-14T02:21:31.686+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"it's fun playing bad champs vs bad champs though. it's not meant to be taken seriously either. think of it as a way to experience new champs.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Project Xayah","date":"2015-02-14T07:11:35.211+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"1. It's a featured game mode. It's designed for fun. If you can't find fun with it, go back to playing norms/ranked/ARAM and shut the f*ck up.\n2. It provides a good challenge to those who seek it. You play champs you might not normally play, in positions you might not normally play, with a team comp you've probably never seen and against  team comp you've probably never seen. If you don't want a challenge from it, go back to playing norms/ranked/ARAM and shut the f*ck up.\n3. Despite the fact it does seem a little 'lazy' or 'uninspired' it's actually a good idea for a featured game mode. It's not something you'd normally do, picking things for you enemy while they pick things for you and if you refuse to accept that go back to playing norms/ranked/ARAM and shut the f*ck up.\n4. This game mode will give Riot a chance to better balance the less played, or as you called them 'sh!t', champs. If you don't like that go back to playing norms/ranked/ARAM and shut the f*ck up.\n5. No ones forcing you to play it, it's only around for a couple more weeks so go back to playing norms/ranked/ARAM and shut the f*ck up.","replies":[{"poster":"hðnkƒørÇªmíllè","date":"2015-02-14T08:32:37.025+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Preach the Quinn love Heart ♡","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Knuuckles","date":"2015-02-14T02:52:54.215+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"absolutely littered with trolls played it a few times and severely disappointing","replies":[]},{"poster":"HellStrikerZ","date":"2015-02-14T05:52:25.884+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"This game mode is the only game mode where trolling is acceptable lol.

If you make the mistake of giving them a hyper-carry its your fault.\nIts a fun game mode, in my opinion. Even if barely any effort went into making it, I think its quite enjoyable. Its a break from the standard restrictions of League of Legend's meta.\nIf you don't like it, don't play it. The other queues are still open.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Garens Harem","date":"2015-02-14T02:31:52.033+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"ITT- opinions","replies":[]}]}
