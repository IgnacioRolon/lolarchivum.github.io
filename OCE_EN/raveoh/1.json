Not ranked. I've only ever played probably all up 50 ranked games. I have 1163 normal wins. I'm silver.\r\n\r\nI'm trying to practice ADC so I can start playing ranked seriously, but I'm losing almost literally every single game. I noticed this started happening a few weeks ago. I usually have a really clean looking match history with 1 / 2 losses in it. Now my match history has 3 wins in the entire thing you can see. The problem seems to be 1 or 2 feeders on my team every single game without fail. Just got out of a game with a 0/15/7 Zilian, which isn't even the worst I've had. A few days ago I had a 0/22 Talon. When I play with a team of 3 or 4 I win. They are the only wins in my match history. When I duo queue I lose WITHOUT fail. My friends have joined my games and have noticed the same thing. My gf has played about 6-7 games duo queue with me this week and has noted the same thing. Every single game 1/2 feeders. **Every time**. I've also noticed that often our entire team will be comprised of bronze/silver players and the other team will consistently have gold/plat and sometimes even diamond players.\r\n\r\nDoes anyone know why this is happening? Is it something to do with my MMR or because I'm playing normals? Or am I just being unlucky? I feel like I do really well at the start of each game. I win my lane with few exceptions, but when I get out of lane there's always 1 person on their team who has been fed completely....","replies":[{"poster":"Ing√©nue","date":"2015-03-14T08:49:42.178+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"probably just unlucky :/ A good idea is to get a 5 man pre made so that you have reliable teammates. \nThe 'being placed with bronze and silver and against plat and diamond' is also pretty unlucky, their mmr for norms would be the mmr for a low elo player simply because they don't play enough normals, hence you having to play against them.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Spidicus","date":"2015-03-16T04:13:37.547+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"\"Normally I only lose a few games ....
