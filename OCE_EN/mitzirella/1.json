Hard to make friends in normal games so I thought I'd give the forum a go. I'm not salty at all so don't stress about flame! \r\n\r\nI'm also in the process of climbing from Gold IV so if you're interested, wanna be duo buddies? I main Jinx ADC and mid lane, I also play support so I'm versatile with 3 lanes. \r\n\r\nJust add my summoner (mitzirella) if you're keen to play this trash game together","replies":[{"poster":"MyLyfSucs","date":"2019-10-09T06:18:06.814+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey man, I’m not really good at league (silver 4 once I’m finished placements) but I’m always looking for new people to play with, my irl’s are kinda toxic and I don’t like that. I play a bit of everything. However I can’t add you right now because my league client is glitching out and won’t open. But I’ll add as soon as I can :)","replies":[]}]}
