Early game is not as important as decision making late. It's an ability to make right calls and rotation on a map is what separates an average adc from an adc main. \n\nThen there is other group of adcs/supports who has 0 respect for their partner and think they did everything on their own. I just hate playing with people like that!","replies":[{"poster":"Oriphix","date":"2018-04-18T23:48:23.725+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The thing is mistakes happen, instead of focusing on recovering or how to improve people start blaming. The excessive use of ? pings for a mistake is ridiculous which seems to be the norm now to many players which is really frustrating.
