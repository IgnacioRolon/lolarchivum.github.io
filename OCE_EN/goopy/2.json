The custom skins also did not show in the menu of skins I installed.\r\nAnd I tried to load into a game which had a Amumu in it, but apparently he is missing from the game files, as I had Spidermumu instead of original Amumu skin.\r\nSo now I have to re-download LoL because I made the stupid decision to delete a file because it didn&#039;t look neat in my hard drive (I like things to be organized)\r\n\r\nWill this uninstall the custom skins and put the skins and put it back to normal?","replies":[{"poster":"SephirothSG","date":"2016-01-14T12:38:49.614+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey man,\n\nYou already said you're reinstalling your game, this should definitely fix your problem and yes, it will remove your custom skins.","replies":[]}]}
