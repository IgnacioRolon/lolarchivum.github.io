Pretty good.\nBut the player model skin itself lacks color. \nIf you look at the hair, it has a grey scale type of theme with the blonde. I think her hair should be a bright, vibrant blonde.\nThe red and white suit also lackss in color, if you look at it the red seems to look as if it is lacking in color, which I think should be a real eye-popping red that is very luminous. \nAnd the white areas seem to be almost grey, which does not look appealing.\nIf these tweaks could be put onto Katarina&#039;s Christmas skin that would be good to see, as it is a skin none the less and should look appealing to purchase and look as good as the splash art says.\n\n(I would of put images onto this discussion but I do not know how xD )","replies":[{"poster":"vhumy2001","date":"2015-12-23T12:31:03.532+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Maybe they will just change the splash\nThe chance of skin re-animation is rare unless in reworks\nSo long,reworked Kat{{champion:55}} \nBut I dont have a problem with her kit right now(Maybe a slow?)","replies":[]},{"poster":"Jink","date":"2015-12-22T13:54:53.087+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Can we have the pole dancin /d back too that shit was majelic.","replies":[]}]}
