Work was finishing for most citizens of the land, but for Vayne and Lucian it was just getting started.\nThey met years after Lucian lost his wife Senna, to the demonic afterlife named Thresh. They met by chance in Noxus and both saw potential in working as a team to rid of the evil magic that was poisoning the land. They strolled down a dark alley in Nomedlrow; a city to the north of Noxus. They quickly slipped on hoodies to keep their identities unknown as they erupted onto the noisy streets; as  traders selling unknown items to their customers, all had daggers in their malicious smiles. One of them glared at Vayne as they passed, slashing away at an animal carcass and exchanged it for 3 gold serpent coins with a customer. This sent a shiver down Vayne&rsquo;s spine, and looked forward.\n&ldquo;Wonder what work we&rsquo;ll get tonight,&rdquo; said Lucian. &ldquo;Last night we had to deal with some gruesome stuff.&rdquo; \n&ldquo;Whatever filth comes our way, I&rsquo;m sure we will purify it&rdquo; replied Vayne. She did not like conjuring up conversation with Lucian; not because she did not like Lucian as a working partner, but she was focussed on work. They took a left down another alley, then a right down a narrow corridor and another left to come to a sombre building named Emundabit&rsquo;s Quodorbis. Lucian knocked three times, then two times. A metallic grinding was heard as a sliding door moved to reveal green eyes, peeping at who knocked. &ldquo;Password?&rdquo; the figure spoke with a croaky tone. &ldquo;Let this world be purified as it once was&rdquo; they both said quietly. The slider slide shut, and numerous locks and chains were heard being unlocked.\n\nThe door creaked open, and they entered. It was a bar; tables scattered around the place, the lights were dimmed, the conversations were discrete and the people inside were all cloaked. Vayne and Lucian sat at the bench tops on ancient stools, as the figure with the green eyes took off his hoody to reveal the face of a human, with green skin and scars all over. He waltzed behind the bar with a skip in his step and beamed at the two of them.\n&ldquo;So, what&rsquo;s the situation this time?&rdquo; Lucian said as the bartender passed them beverages. &ldquo;This one&rsquo;s on me&rdquo; He said. &ldquo;Boy do I have a mission for you!&rdquo; He got a bunch of ancient papers and flunked them on the top and rotated them towards the two of them. &ldquo;This one is a shocker,&rdquo; exclaimed the bartender. &ldquo;A gang of bandits to the west of Zaun have been reported by sorcerers to be kidnapping lost people and bring them into a dark, dark forest and mutating them into creatures of evil.&rdquo; Vayne read through the papers, to gather any information that would be helpful. One thing did catch her eye out though. &ldquo;With all of our missions, there has been an author or a list of people who have reported, but this one has none. What is the reason for this?&rdquo; \n\nVayne noticed a drop of sweat form on the bartender&rsquo;s forehead and his breaths came quick. &ldquo;Ugh, I think they lost them. The person who gave it to me was cloaked, so I could not identify him and ask.&rdquo; _He is lying. There must be a reason for this. I do not trust this one._ &ldquo;Get ready Vayne, we&rsquo;re heading for Zaun&rdquo; said Lucian and put an energy crystal into his gun. &ldquo;What?&rdquo; said Vayne, rising her eyebrow. &ldquo;Do you expect us to believe that this is safe if the papers are not filed or authored correctly? This is a trap.&rdquo; &ldquo;Vayne.&rdquo; Expressed Lucian. &ldquo;You said that no matter what you will do whatever it takes to purify this land, no matter what the risk is, did you not? This mission will help those who are being corrupted with magic. And besides, this will pay handsomely. You can finally get more bolts for your crossbow.&rdquo; Vayne went quiet. _It will pay for a big amount. But still&hellip;_ &ldquo;Very well.&rdquo; said Vayne hesitantly and got off the stool. &ldquo;But keep your guard up, and your eyes open. Check the shadows for anything impure.&rdquo; &ldquo;The same to you.&rdquo; Said Lucian.\n&ldquo;Before you go!&rdquo; exclaimed the green figure, he searched under the bar to eventually bring out an ancient medallion for the two of them. &ldquo;Gifts I bear! They will protect you and enhance your skills in combat. They were made for the knights of the Old King.&rdquo; The medallion had a faded symbol of a rose. _That symbol, so familiar&hellip;_\n&ldquo;Good luck!&rdquo; shrieked the bartender, as they opened the door. Vayne heard him whisper under his breath &ldquo;you&rsquo;ll need it.&rdquo; \nThey left the bar and stopped for supplies for the trip ahead, and exited Nomedlrows gates to head for Zaun. They travelled along the trails by night, and kept to the shadows at day. Hardly anything was said between the two of them. They were both focussed on the mission assigned for them. \n\n\nThey followed the directions the bartender had given them, and leaded them to the forest.\nThe trees were all dead and seemed intimidating; and a white, misty, screened fog came oozing through the branches. &ldquo;This is it then,&rdquo; said Lucian. &ldquo;Was hoping for a forest with a bit of life&rdquo; and chuckled to himself. Vayne peered through the fog, and could have sworn she saw a dark, shadowy figure dart from one tree to another and disappeared. They walked into the forest; keeping their eyes open for any movement and stepped slowly, to avoid any traps that could be set for them. \nThe fog made it difficult to do so, but they weren&rsquo;t gullible. It was extremely quiet, the only thing that was audible was their footsteps on the earth. Suddenly, a blood curdling scream was heard to the west of them, and both jumped at the sound. They ran towards the sound to come to a clearing, where engravings have been marked in the earth, and skeletons were scattered everywhere. Vayne could smell the distinct stench of human blood. I will end whoever had done such terrible things. They readied their weapons and looked around peering into the darkness. More screams were heard, as if the voices were circling the clearing. The voices came closer; they were in the form of green auras. &ldquo;Thresh&rdquo; they both said.\n\nAn evil, undead chuckle was heard, and out came Thresh. His lantern of souls was noticeably bigger in size. &ldquo;Do you like my little trap I set? I knew that with a bit of persuasion and torture I could bring you into my clutches.&rdquo;    &ldquo;You.&rdquo; Lucian said. &ldquo;You will not get away with what you did to Senna.&rdquo; Vayne looked at him to see his hands start to tense, with sweat sliding down his hand. &ldquo;Lucian, calm down&rdquo; said Vayne. Lucian shrieked with anger in his tone and sprinted at Thresh, shooting aimlessly. Thresh simply swerved to the right and said &ldquo;Hex the one with the angered mind, make him mine for me to bind. Make him be deceived by evil. Make him battle is friend who seek this world to be peaceful!&rdquo; The marked engravings on the earth glowed a dark purple, and Lucian stopped dead in his tracks. He turned to Vayne, the medallion glowed with a bright purple, the rose in full color. The Black Rose corporation&rsquo;s symbol! How did I not see that!? He aimed his gun at Vayne. &ldquo;He is under my control,&rdquo; said Thresh. &ldquo;The Black Rose&rsquo;s new hex&rsquo;s and deceiving spells can only be broken by killing the conjurer.&rdquo; Vayne tumbled to the right as Lucian fired a shot directly at her. She couldn&rsquo;t shoot him, it would kill. He shot two more energy bolts, one passing through Vayne&rsquo;s right shoulder. She shrieked in pain. He shot again, but Vayne used her special ability where she could become invisible temporarily. She manoeuvred out of the way to progress onto Thresh. She searched him with her eyes for any weaknesses_. Chest? No. Head? Of course not. _She realised, the lantern must be it. She had no choice, she shot three bolts at the lantern as she fell on the earth. Thresh shrieked in agony, as the lantern split, the souls within being freed from their endless torture.\nThresh disintegrated almost immediately, and Lucian was about to end Vayne before the aura in the medallion fading, and started to come to his senses. &ldquo;My head is throbbing&rdquo; he said. He soon looked around to see Vayne bleeding, and no sign of Thresh. He ran and helped her up. &ldquo;What happened?!&rdquo; exclaimed Lucian. Vayne just said &ldquo;I&rsquo;m okay, just help me up and I&rsquo;ll tell you everything.&rdquo;","replies":[{"poster":"freedykugger","date":"2017-06-04T08:41:21.267+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"the context was awesome just the buildup was to long i lost interest half way but otherways great story{{sticker:slayer-jinx-wink}}","replies":[]},{"poster":"Oneechan","date":"2016-07-10T13:40:02.855+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Tense and mysterious in the beginning, but I feel the build-up is just a tiny bit long.

One thing I noticed is that in the opening sentence you repeated 'started' a lot. Maybe you could replace the second one with began and remove the last.
