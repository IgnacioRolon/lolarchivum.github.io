After a day at work and wanting to relax i started league. First game in, pregame chat had the support asking for mid and having the midlaner subsequently correct them for poor spelling and then a top laner that threw out an ultimatum where he&#039;d run it down mid and play blitz top. Here i thought they were just screwing around so i ignored it for most part and didn&#039;t dodge which was my mistake.\r\n\r\nLess than 5mins in our adc was already flaming the support and top laner was spam pinging me mia and trash talking. I understand i should have muted but i kinda snapped and said what was said here which had the in game chat starting maybe 12-15mins in. I definitely crossed a line and im not trying to justify it but off 1 game during the christmas holiday feels a bit unfair since it also denies me being able to farm up my prestige akali skin as well.\r\n\r\nWith no prior chat restrictions and being provoked after game by the entire team all game i personally would have believed i would have gotten one of the chat restrictions first, instead of a straight up final warning. Sorry to everyone if this seems a bit whiney and unfair but there has been precedents of OCE emissaries telling people to appeal 14 day chat restrictions in the past.\r\n\r\nMerry Christmas and a Happy New Year thanks for reading this post.\r\n\r\nGame 1\r\nPre-Game\r\nTruth: ?\r\nTruth: what\r\nTruth: why all the hate\r\nTruth: wtf\r\nTruth: sure\r\nTruth: im cool with this\r\n\r\nIn-Game\r\nTruth: fucking tilted\r\nTruth: this game is over\r\nTruth: try having a team that doesnt make you wanna neck yourself\r\nTruth: blitz toxic since champ select\r\nTruth: go fucking neck yourself blitz\r\nTruth: you sat top and let xin steal my red\r\nTruth: of course you&#039;d watch tyler 1\r\nTruth: only spastic shits\r\nTruth: watch him\r\nTruth: you wanna run it down midd\r\nTruth: sure\r\nTruth: im going to fucking run it down mid\r\nTruth: im done with this game\r\nTruth: if you arent afraid to call your own bluff blitz\r\nTruth: go uninstall\r\nTruth: brand you go fuck yourself too the first thing in chat you say was being a shit spelling nazi to xerath\r\nTruth: can you just end this game\r\nTruth: np bro\r\nTruth: not even inting since nobody got my kill\r\nTruth: end please\r\nTruth: blitz seriously you have no fucking balls\r\nTruth: why make an ultimatum\r\nTruth: its k guys we can still win\r\nTruth: some idiot voted no\r\nTruth: i started the fucking vote\r\nTruth: you spastic %%%%\r\nTruth: when i start the vote\r\nTruth: im trying\r\nTruth: that&#039;s not pushing\r\nTruth: that&#039;s diving you liar\r\nTruth: fuck off\r\nTruth: this blitz is the worst shitter ive seen\r\nTruth: well your lucian wont fucking kill me\r\nTruth: gg\r\nTruth: ty for ending fast\r\nTruth: nvm\r\n\r\nPost-Game\r\nTruth: never wanted to tell someone to kill themselves until now\r\nTruth: but i won&#039;t\r\nTruth: because rules\r\nTruth: enjoy chat ban?\r\nTruth: for threatening to run it down mid early like you did\r\nTruth: in champ select\r\nTruth: yeah good luck m8\r\nTruth: good\r\nTruth: i hope you feel hurt\r\nTruth: :)\r\nTruth: and what is riot going to see\r\nTruth: and they&#039;re going to see blitz\r\nTruth: provoking\r\nTruth: good fucking luck\r\nTruth: getting anything through\r\nTruth: GOOOOOOOOOOOOD FUCKING LUCK\r\nTruth: YOU SHIT %%%%\r\n\r\nHad this posted on the NA boards by accident and so i came here instead since i know in OCE especially Australia Profanity is more mildly accepted here.","replies":[{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2018-12-29T10:24:15.512+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":">Truth: go fucking neck yourself blitz\n\n>Truth: only spastic shits\nTruth: watch him\n\n>Truth: you spastic %%%%\n\nIgnoring the rest of your log (which almost certainly would have netted you a chat restriction), the reason you received a 14 day ban is because of Riot's policies regarding no tolerance language. The no tolerance language in question is suicide encouragement and ableist slurs, but also includes things like racism, sexism, etc.\n\nYou get only a single warning for no tolerance language (14 day ban) because of the severity of the behaviour, but ultimately that's what this is - a strong warning.\n\nYou can appeal your punishment to [player support](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/requests/new) if you wish, but I can basically guarantee that your punishment will not be removed or reduced.\n\nWhile you clearly feel you should not be punished so harshly for a single game, many would argue that such a reaction is not by any stretch appropriate. Consider it this way, your reaction to someone being an asshole in a *video game* was to literally and in no uncertain terms tell them that they should *end their life*. Such a reaction is far from appropriate, and hardly in the realm of understandable either.\n\nNo-one expects you to be perfect, and no-one expects you to not get frustrated, but this reaction is a far cry from okay.","replies":[{"poster":"Truth","date":"2018-12-29T10:43:21.667+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Replied to INGENUE what i would have replied for this comment too\n\nThanks for taking your time to reply.","replies":[{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2018-12-29T14:09:05.442+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"While I cannot in any way condone what was said, even in the case of someone being a right dickhead, this is still just a warning.

Keep in mind that response times may be a little slow due to it being the holidays, but do not create multiple tickets as it does slow it down even further.\n\n___________\n\n\nMental health and suicide are no laughing matter, and Riot are doing their best to crack down on it. \nMuch like hate speech (racism, sexism, homophobia), it often gets escalated and you skip that chat restriction tiers. \n\nNo matter what happens in a game, or however shitty your IRL day was, there is literally 0 reason to tell another player to kill themselves. \n\n>Truth: go fucking neck yourself blitz\n>Truth: never wanted to tell someone to kill themselves until now\n\n__________\n\nThe rest of your log screams negativity, and I get it, We've all been there, we have all flamed in some some capacity. Bad days and games happen, and as long as it isn't a common thing (and you dont resort to the lowest of the lows) then you won't deal with bans and punishments. \n\n__________\n\n>Truth: and what is riot going to see\nTruth: and they're going to see blitz\nTruth: provoking\nTruth: good fucking luck\nTruth: getting anything through\nTruth: GOOOOOOOOOOOOD FUCKING LUCK\nTruth: YOU SHIT %%%%\n\nThe system judges you based on YOUR actions and YOUR words. Doesn't matter if someone else is provoking you, you will only ever be judged on what you have said and done in the game. We are given a few tools to deal with this (such as muting chat, pings and emotes) and there is also the action of dodging a lobby  where pre-game toxicity is obvious (like in your case), or simply AFKing to preserve your mental and account standing. Not that I encourage leaving your games (it really is a last last resort before you do something stupid like tell someone to kill themselves), but the leaverbuster punishment is far less severe than getting an account ban.","replies":[{"poster":"Truth","date":"2018-12-29T10:40:58.339+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Not trying to justify the words that were said and i do regret it now looking back onto it, Pre-game toxicity i would have dodged if it weren't for the consistent dodging i've had to do currently and i have been hit by leaverbuster before for single emergencies.\n\nWhat got to me specifically was the blitz trying to play the victim card after starting a fight i suppose and even though it definitely isn't okay to say that, i suppose i just assumed that under the context of the situation there would be some leniency or a chat restriction applied but now i know that's no justification or leniency for anything like this even with a clean record for 5-6 years.\n\nThanks for replying.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"hokyabox","date":"2018-12-31T09:12:47.823+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Had this posted on the NA boards by accident and so i came here instead since i know in OCE especially Australia Profanity is more mildly accepted here.\n\nProfanity....lol , He is asking? will the Australians understand...lol, yeah, we understand.\nYou shit head.\n\nNow fuck off.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Chocolate Cake","date":"2018-12-29T08:09:42.788+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":3,"body":"because riot dont give a shit and treat all players negative or not as toxic asshole thats why nice people can get permi banned from 1 game their system is hog shit and refuse to fix it because it makes them money","replies":[{"poster":"XD haha","date":"2018-12-29T08:31:15.448+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Chocolate Cake,realm=OCE,application-id=T8eq2lFQ,discussion-id=PoPGAMXs,comment-id=0000,timestamp=2018-12-29T08:09:42.788+0000)\n>\n> because riot dont give a shit and treat all players negative or not as toxic asshole thats why nice people can get permi banned from 1 game their system is hog shit and refuse to fix it because it makes them money\n\nEasy does it now","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"XD haha","date":"2018-12-29T08:28:39.836+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Just from this chat, what I'm seeing is that your principle is \"if you wanna get on this level, then so can I\". It's definitely how most people works, I wouldn't have given you a 14 day ban, maybe a 5 game chat ban? But the thing is, you have to understand to adjust your emotion levels. If you allow others to define the  playing field that you're going to fight on, then you're letting yourself be manipulated emotionally. You cannot do that, at one point you just have to learn to say \"cool story\" \"k thanks bye\" or \"whatever muted\" instead of going onto a full on keyboard war. \n\nBecause the truth is, no one is going to remember you after that game ended, no matter how badly or greatly you performed. Your egos, presence and innate abilities are not information anyone else cares about,  even if you buff up your chest and protect your reputation the only thing that's going to get harmed is your ability to play games, and maybe your ranked level. \n\nSo, I'm going to say this:\n1. Riot, revert the 14 day ban this one is a bit unfair\n2. Truth, do not let your emotions get in your way","replies":[]}]}
