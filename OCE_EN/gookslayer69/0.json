This season they seem to have thrown a curve ball with the ranking system, and it&#039;s fairly impossible to climb as fast as you fall with the amount of afk&#039;s and trolls etc.\r\n\r\nThis season I was unluckily placed in B5, but got as far as my series to Silver again, however I failed my series, and have drastically fallen back to B4.\r\n\r\nI main mid {{champion:90}} 50 games in ranked, positive KDA (somewhere around 8.1/7/10, average of 180 cs and 65% win rate. \r\n\r\nBut can also play {{champion:1}} {{champion:99}} {{champion:115}} {{champion:25}}  fairly well in mid. \r\n\r\nI can play {{champion:77}} {{champion:31}} {{champion:19}} {{champion:9}} well in the jgl.\r\n\r\nI can play {{champion:31}} {{champion:36}} {{champion:41}} {{champion:1}} well top lane \r\n\r\nI can adc {{champion:222}} {{champion:104}} comfortably, but its not a preference.\r\n\r\nAnd I can support {{champion:1}} {{champion:16}} {{champion:412}} {{champion:25}} {{champion:201}} {{champion:53}} quite well. \r\n\r\nA lot of other champs I can play kind of okay, but wouldnt try ranked queue with them unless I have worked on them. \r\n\r\nI know alot of other people are having the same struggle of placing back to where they were last season, and it&#039;s not because their playing badly themselves, it&#039;s quite frequently the people they get put with. \r\n\r\nIf anyone&#039;s interested add GookSlayer69 (the name is a personal joke, and when I made it I intended to play league once and never return) and send a message when you see me online.\r\n\r\nCheers.","replies":[{"poster":"Smurf Commando","date":"2015-04-14T05:40:58.662+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Lol send me a request and I wanna I'll play a ranked game with you I fell from silver cause of trolls and feeders/afkers so ik tf so yea add me and play tonight if you can","replies":[]},{"poster":"Homura Akemi","date":"2015-04-08T16:39:28.606+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'm vry bud b0ss","replies":[]}]}
