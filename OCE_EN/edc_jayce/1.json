Now I see the problem, if you have read my history matcha you might find out the date is different , i was busy on my study, but the date shows me I&#039;m still in the game, which mean some one knows my account, but have to said I didn&#039;t tell any one my account. People will not read the history match when they login to the game,they read the store pages first. So I have no idea for that as well. Cause change in D/F to me some time is like I&#039;m play riven D is flash and F is tp . So that is the issues. What else can I do to fix this. I mean can u please help me out? Or Anything I need to work with you to unlock my account ? If you read this let me know please.\r\n\r\nRegard","replies":[{"poster":"Tele","date":"2016-07-28T04:28:59.637+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey man,\n\nJust before I answer your question let's clear this up first. The people who replied to your [previous post](http://boards.oce.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/player-behaviour/lUR2PlEX-this-account-has-been-permanently-suspended) were just ordinary players. They just assumed you were banned for elo boosting, none of them actually knew for sure.\n\nI'm an emissary. We're part of a group of board volunteers who help with issues like yours.\n\n> **Anyway, on to your answer:**\n> \n> You said you received a notification saying _\"This account has been permanently suspended.\"_ That could mean anything, not just elo boosting.\n\n> You have to go contact [**Riot Support**](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/requests/new) and ask them why you were banned. Use the link I have attached to do that.\n\nI hope this helps. Feel free to reply if you encounter any problems ;)","replies":[{"poster":"Edc Jayce","date":"2016-07-28T12:09:56.512+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hello my friend,\n\nThey sent me back a email says I used the hacks things, but I'm not!  I don't even know lol has hacks thing!  That is very weak, man! They just tell me like Yo ! Our system found out that you were using hacks things, we have to ban your account.  ????  I'm just like \"Sorry what did you said????\"   People standing here for a reason. And me , I just want the truth and the justices.","replies":[{"poster":"Tele","date":"2016-07-29T04:12:21.935+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"That's something you'll have to sort out with them sadly, I'm not really qualified to help here. If **Riot** bans someone they always make sure that they're 100% sure scripting has occurred.\n\nIf you say it definitely wasn't you, then chances are your account has been compromised at some point and a player ran scripts on it.","replies":[]}]}]}]}
