Now I see the problem, if you have read my history matcha you might find out the date is different , i was busy on my study, but the date shows me I'm still in the game, which mean some one knows my account, but have to said I didn't tell any one my account. People will not read the history match when they login to the game,they read the store pages first. So I have no idea for that as well. Cause change in D/F to me some time is like I'm play riven D is flash and F is tp . So that is the issues. What else can I do to fix this. I mean can u please help me out? Or Anything I need to work with you to unlock my account ?

I'm gonna be honest, though, I sometimes swap flash to 'D' from 'F\" if I'm playing certain champs or if I'm using a different keyboard. It doesn't signal boosting.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Vanilla Bread","date":"2016-07-25T03:48:53.339+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Lata hehe","replies":[]},{"poster":"kaboomblah","date":"2016-07-24T01:12:21.649+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Sigh.
