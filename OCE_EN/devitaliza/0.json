Our usual playing times are 5-12PM (New Zealand time) so basically all evening. We have a fully dedicated teamspeak 3 server with 50 slots that can be used by you and anyone you would like to talk/play with once you have expressed interest in our group and have joined in a few games. We also have a 150+ member steam group that plays other games for anyone interested.\r\n\r\nIf you are interested in any of this please post below:\r\n1. Your age (must be over 16)\r\n2. Your games played (we would much prefer level 25+ is possible, but any level can be accepted)\r\n3. Your preferred role/s\r\n\r\nYou must also be willing to work as a team\r\n\r\nIf you are interested simply post your reply below and I will send you our teamspeak details and any other details required.\r\n\r\n(Also, if you are wondering about my level/games played please note that I will at most times not be participating in LoL games, so don't worry about my inexperience :))\r\n\r\nThanks for your time :)","replies":[{"poster":"Lord Cyrus","date":"2015-01-15T04:10:11.393+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'm 19, the only game like this i play is league, i'm level 30 bronze 2 and steadily climbing, i will play anything except adc and i'm a kiwi so i'm available at the times specified.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Juju fancIub","date":"2015-01-07T13:36:23.999+0000","up_votes":0,"down_votes":0,"body":"Dammit, im 15 :(\nIf that counts then here are my details.\nI am level 30 but in ranked my best was b3 before being demoted to b4. Then my main was ultimately banned cause my friend kept dc'ing when I let him play during my trip to america. My current account has around 2010 wins.\nI find shaco jungle very fun but I am a solid blitzcrank support user. I used to main morganna and I am also an ok thresh player. Since this year I am in year 11, I might not have the same playing schedule. My last years one, I was available around 4-5pm and 10pm-3am EST. If there is no one else available then feel free to add me. If you get at least two players then you dont need to contact me. Good luck have fun recruiting more people ;)","replies":[{"poster":"Devitaliza","date":"2015-01-09T05:05:13.314+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"That is fine :) as long as you can act mature you can check the group out.
