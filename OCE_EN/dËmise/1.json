You have to consider that upgrading the server's capacity is a big undertaking, and they'll want to be confident that it's actually warranted before going through with it (and also keep in mind, no *definite* word yet as to whether TFT will stay on the permanent roster). As it stands, we've had TFT for less than a week, and the beta and ranked releases for the mode (coupled with the fact the Arcade event is currently running) are likely causing an increased amount of players to jump on. I've been playing a bit of TFT myself and noticed more than a few low level accounts (level 1's in particular) getting into the mode, so it does seem to be attracting extra players currently, but whether that's a *long-term* trend isn't going to be evident just yet.\n\nBit of a side note: the fact that we're getting actual login queues for OCE could be a good sign anyway. If it is a long-term trend, it means the server's population will be going up, and Riot *may* decide to adjust the queue schedule accordingly, such as making normal draft and ranked flex full-time, and bringing TT onto a more regular schedule.","replies":[]},{"poster":"JinHae","date":"2019-06-29T14:47:28.712+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"idk why everyone is crying about que times I literally never have to wait to log in or play.","replies":[]}]}
