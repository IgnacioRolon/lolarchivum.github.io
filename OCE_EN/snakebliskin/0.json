Dota 2 feels much better in this aspect and i feel it lowers the skill ceiling of LoL a little.\r\n\r\nToo many heroes!:  Trying to balance this game must be a nightmare with the roster being this large.  Dota 2 has a lot of heroes but LoL has a mega tonn which i beleive leads to balancing issues.\r\n\r\nToo bursty:  Fights are over way too fast in comparison to Dota 2 early to mid game.  I was getting deleted as Darius at lvl 9 with 2 decent +HP items (1520 hp at the time) by a Zed who simply pressed a few buttons.  HP shredded that early in the game like that against a tanky hero is unheard of in Dota.  Shorter fights imo = less skillful and strategic gameplay.  I also had a player at lvl 12 dive our base through 2 towers and proceed to 2 shot me with melee attacks, again this is unheard of in dota to be diving at lvl 12 like that.  The damage needs to be toned down in a big way to slow down game play and allow for more strategy because atm its way too dumbed down.\r\n\r\nNo items like Blink dagger or invisibility cloaks.  No curiour to bring your items from the shop.  no teleport scrolls.\r\n\r\nFeelsbadman.  Bad first impression.  sorry","replies":[{"poster":"Nightjar","date":"2019-01-22T12:10:12.406+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"part of it's depth is in the simplicity, much like the chinese puzzle game GO. There is also the fact that league is a fundementally different, more casual and typically a faster game than DOTA2. In League lvl12-14 around 22min is about where a high rank game is going to end.\n\nCreeps being easy to kill, opens up the possibly of eating a minion wave with a few spells and roaming, in exchange for mana and not pressuring your opponent when they cs, in League you get much more opportunity to try to impact another lane if you time when you crash your minion wave well.\n\nWhilst last hitting is much easier and there are less denial mechanics, it does encourage developing the ability to control a minion wave to become an essential skill at lower skill levels. In DOTA 2, let's be honest, even 500+ hour players won't be comfortable with denial, staggering and timing the build up of a minion wave to push, they may not even be aware of it's effectiveness.\n\nWhereas in League, because of the much simpler csing mechanics, a good player can pick up and begin to learn about the basics of a minion wave easily within 300 hours. In league since it's harder to 'deny' a player, it's also harder to completely shut out an opponent from the game which is a bit fairer considering how much weaker league towers are, how easy it is to snowball and turn an individual advantage into a teamwide lead, and how much quicker you can close out a game of league of legends.\n\nLeague isn't actually that bursty, depending on your characters, even compared to DOTA, but again, it's a faster game pace, and you'll often find that your tanky character might not be on even footing to that assassin. I'd be willing to bet that you underestimated how much of a powerspike that Zed had on your darius. In DOTA gold gives you more options and build customization, which allows more flexibility and more diverse lategame options, but in League, alot of what we spend our gold on is alot of raw stats, and so any advantage gained in lane shows more visibly, especially at 1-2 item powerspikes. Also since we choose to buy into stats more than actives and extra abilities, alot of our heroes/champions at early levels have very similar balances of tankiness to damage, which means falling behind can make it feel like you're insufficient at either.\n\nIf you came into LoL expecting a DOTA2 clone, you'd only be half right.  League is faster, more casual, and easier to learn than DOTA, but there isn't a lack of strategic depth. Because the entry floor and basics are simpler, optimization and understanding of the game becomes more important at lower ranks, even in the average rank, knowing how to move around the map, take camps, cs, objective rotations, watching professional players and understanding item choices begins to start showing up and becoming important at lower skill levels. \n\nAlso if League ticks you off so much, try Heroes of the Storm. Imagine the difference of moving from DOTA to League, and then triple that dumb down feeling.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Outis","date":"2019-01-22T18:15:24.582+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"my experience with dota 2 is the opposite of what you're saying. game is all about point and click cc abilities that last way too long. then you get burst down while you're cced or silenced for 5+ seconds. not sure how you equate that to being skillful.","replies":[{"poster":"Krispy Migraine","date":"2019-01-22T19:44:05.010+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Mars the Dumbars,realm=OCE,application-id=FjGAIbRv,discussion-id=kG7MTv3n,comment-id=0002,timestamp=2019-01-22T18:15:24.582+0000)\n>\n> my experience with dota 2 is the opposite of what you&#x27;re saying. game is all about point and click cc abilities that last way too long. then you get burst down while you&#x27;re cced or silenced for 5+ seconds. not sure how you equate that to being skillful.\n\noh hello you were on my team yesterday","replies":[{"poster":"Outis","date":"2019-01-23T05:48:41.693+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"hi","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"DarkShade918","date":"2019-01-23T00:05:46.760+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"First things first, DoTA is trash, always has been, always will be (doesn't stop me from playing it though)\n\nDoTA and LoL are two very different games, although both MOBAs, DoTA is slow, and is more strategy driven, league doesn't need that, since the games last 30 mins or less (unless you're in an elo where no one knows what ending is).\n\nBalancing is a nightmare, but i'd say a 5+ second stun in DoTA is far more unbalanced than the 3 second Morg snare that in itself, is arguably busted, the reason balancing is a nightmare comes down to two things (champion count has nothing to do with it), the first is how much focus on pro play there is vs solo play, riot doesn't care much about how normal players feel, when they balance for high elo pro players, the second is the balancing team are low ranked, and play maybe 1 game a week, so they actually don't know shit about how the game works, and listen entirely to the complaints of high elo pro's assuming that the Pro's know something about the game that they don't\n\nYou can creep block, its a hard strategy to do, so often not worth it, all it takes is to stand as close to on top of the minion you can get and hope the enemy player clicks you instead\n\nToo bursty - league games are short, because of this exact reason, nobody likes being stuck in a 60+ min game, people who do are crazy\n\nBlink dagger is flash, Teleport scroll is teleport\n\nYou don't need invisibility, if you want that, play Akali or some shit, its in kit's instead of an item for a reason, invisibility is a broken ass skill that should never have existed in the first place, Camouflage is just straight up fairer\n\nYou only have a bad impression because you though DoTA and LoL were the same, which means you didn't do any research, you just picked up the game, its like comparing OW to Paladins, same theory, different game different play style","replies":[]},{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2019-01-22T12:20:19.078+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Creeps: That's kind of the point. DotA has *much* longer games than League, and for some people, that's the experience they're looking for. For me personally, and I'm sure I'm not the only one to share the opinion, I prefer League's simpler minion management. DotA creeps were, in my mind, a tedious slog. Too much time managing minions and not enough of the fun stuff.\n\nToo many heroes!: True enough, though even a game like Overwatch with a fraction of the characters will never be perfectly balanced, such is the consequence of a MMO environment. The meta, which is primarily player driven, is constantly changing, which means things that were balanced before in the common matchups and such, now aren't, or people find some obscure combination that just works too well. DotA is the same.\n\nIn Overwatch, a single hero being buffed/nerfed too hard affects a much greater percentage of players, so you could argue the champ diversity is probably a point in League's favour there. Go to forums of any popular online game and there will be balance gripes, it is what it is.\n\nToo burtsy: While pretty much anyone will agree that too much snowballing isn't all that fun, this again comes to League having shorter match times. It's unusual to see matches at 50 minutes, where DotA games stretch well past that. Assassin's are just that, and being new to the game means you miss a lot of nuance. How fed was the Zed? How many items did he have? Were you building/playing to Darius' strengths or just building what looked tanky? Darius is a bruiser not a straight tank, and much of his survivability depends on his kit and not just his items. I'm sure you had similar experiences when you started DotA, even if the matches are slower paced.\n\nThis comes down to a style thing. A lot of people (generally outsiders) see League and DotA as basically interchangeable just because they fall into the same genre and have the same roots, but they are very different beasts. League games have a much faster pace, even with snowballing being toned down that's still the case.\n\nAs for people diving you that deep, that's because they're damn fed not because it's normal. There are more than a few smurfs in lower levels, so you will face people who are not by any stretch new to the game, that advantage means a lot. Again DotA alleviates some of this with it's slower pace, because early game doesn't involve anywhere near as much trading as League does so it's harder to get fed early.\n\nBlink Dagger is Flash. Invisibility is a powerful tool and very easy to abuse, which is why it's specifically and deliberately built in kits in different forms, not given to anyone who wants it. You don't need a courier to bring your items because you can teleport back to base yourself which is a whole strategy in and of itself. Teleport scrolls are Teleport.\n\nI get the feeling you have a bad impression of League because you want it to be DotA with a bigger population. That's not what League is, so if that's what you're expecting, it's not surprising you were disappointed.","replies":[]}]}
