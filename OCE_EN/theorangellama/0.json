With that, I want to buy a mid/top lane champion. I like champions that don't make me bored after 5 round or so...  I played Yasuo recently and found him to be very fun to play. However, I also played Zed. I realized the outplay potential Zed has, but I am also aware of his multiple counters (Zhonya's, Kayle's Intervention, etc.).\r\n\r\nAs such, I really hope you guys will help me in choosing one of the 2 champions... Comments are welcomed...","replies":[{"poster":"DAVIravi","date":"2015-07-11T07:05:16.804+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Zed or yasuo?

They're both fun champs to play into each other as well. With Zed. A good Zed will be able to work around the Zhonya's or ult prevention. Zed has the added range with his q and w. Yasuo is limited in ranged combat but makes up for it in crit chance and melee combat. I see a lot of new Zed's and Yasuo's spamming their combos. The key to both these champions is to be graceful. The true nature of an assassin. I can't really tell you which one I prefer since I own everything. But you can't go wrong with either. Good luck.","replies":[]},{"poster":"BarryButcher","date":"2015-02-03T15:42:27.123+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yasuo is more fun imo but Zed is just all-round a strong pick in most situations. Yasuo needs to be picked carefully because he can get shat on by certain champs.\n\nPersonally I own Yasuo and not Zed, simply because I've played Zed and im terrible with him LOL and he doesnt interest me enough to put time into getting better","replies":[]}]}
