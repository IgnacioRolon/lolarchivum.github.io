What happens is that when you're playing your placements, you're matched with people based on your mmr from last season (that being gold). Since you're on par with their skill, you'll win/lose about fifty percent of the games. Now, you probably scored the exact same placement in the division you were in last year, but they way Riot do it is that you're placed a few divisions *below* what you're meant to be. This is to encourage you to climb. It prevents people who haven't been playing for a while to get into an extremely high division because they got carried in some of their placement matches, and then end up feeding/losing disastrously for around ten games until they're back in their normal division.\n\nHope that helps clear it up.","replies":[]}]}
