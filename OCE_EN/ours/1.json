Though I'm not sure if this is indeed the case, and that how they pinpoint such a thing without running into problems considering a person could own multiple computers (a desktop and a laptop for instance) or that they may have a routine of visiting internet cafes. Then again, I'm not sure about this part.\n\nAs for why they don't provide any evidence for your ban, it's because unlike other forms of rule-breaching such as being a dickhead in-games, they can't disclose any details when it comes to scripting/3rd party software bans purely out of technical concerns as anyone and their dog could just trial-and-error their way into coding the perfect cheat program by taking the evidences as feedbacks. Hence why they have to keep it in the dark.\n\nI have no idea if your ban is deserved or otherwise, but you, the person who writes this thread, should generally from the bottom of your heart, have the most idea about whether or not you truly deserve this ban.","replies":[]}]}
