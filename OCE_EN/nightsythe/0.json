Sometimes when i get matched against really good players, they often give tips about how to be better when i ask politely, but if I try that now I can't tell whether they're still there or not. The removal of this feature has made post game player interaction more difficult.","replies":[{"poster":"LeeSinToMeOkay","date":"2020-01-13T18:54:20.112+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I feel like this is a bug. I have it too and it's very annoying, the post game client in general feels very glitchy atm.","replies":[{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2020-01-14T02:01:11.884+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It is a bug, but there were other more impactful issues that needed fixing before season start.\n\nYou can still tell when people have left the lobby because the \"player has left\" message still functions as normal.","replies":[]}]}]}
