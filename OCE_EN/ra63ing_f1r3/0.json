We are already seeing balance issues stemming from the updates, and before they fix the balance issues of one set of reworks, they are already working on the next set.\n\nLook at Brand for instance, he was a normal, perfectly balanced champion with an average sized faithful player base, with a normal win rate and ban rate.\nThey rework him, he tops the charts of _\"most fucking annoying champion in the whole game\"_ for several months, gets hard nerfed cos they gave him wayyy too much power, then his role changes from mage to \"support\", as if he wasn't problematic enough.\nThen and after a year of throwing the meta way out of whack and causing a rollercoaster that no one enjoyed, he's back to his average sized faithful player base with a normal win rate and ban rate.\n\nSo what did it accomplish? **Absolutely nothing. **\nIt just ruined a whole lot of games to get back to square 1.\n\nThen we look at updates like Fizz and Zac, who just blatantly became 3x worse than they already were, Zac was strong but manageable, and now his ban rate is ridiculous, and Fizz went from one-shotting 1 person, to one-shotting 3 people, and completely vaporising one of them.\n\nThen we get to the amazing ones like Zed.... \n_\"We will take his bonus AD from W... and give it to R.... WOOOOO!!!! NEW CHAMP ALERT!!\"_\n\nThey say the champions are updated for balance reasons and to create counterplay. _(Tell that to Zac/Fizz/Darius)_ Yet most of the updates have caused more problems than new champs do on release. Kog'Maw was so unbalanced that Riot even had to revert him already, not to mention the several minor-reworks Malz has had in order to keep his minions in check.\n\n________\n\nPersonally, I think that champions should be a rock, they are released after years of working on them _(so a LOT of thought has been put in, unlike the reworks which are a 'dime a dozen'.)_ then they stay that way forever _(with normal balance tweaks here and there of course, as the meta shifts)_\nIn my mind, Champions should only receive updates when there is no other option and the health of that champion _(and the game)_ is threatened.\n\nPoppy/Sion/Yorick etc are examples of these. Champions who were so hideous, so game-breakingly weird, and looked/felt like they should belong to a different game entirely. Those are the champs that should be reworked, no one else.\n\nThe only other reworks I can get behind are ones like LeBlanc, where there is no other solution to balance their kit other than a partial rework.\n\n\nThey work on new champions for years _(Azir took 3 years of development I believe, and we know how long \"Ao Shin\" took....)_. and even then they can only work on a select few at a time, and release them very sparingly. Meanwhile they chug out groups of reworks nearly every month. \n\nSo you can see why they cause problems. They are rushed and not thought out well.\nDefinitely a short term solution. \n\n_______\n\n\nOne thing caught my eye in the 'Ask Riot' posts. _(or /dev... I'm not sure.)\nAnd it was one of the major rework team Rioters saying:\n_\"We are still trying to decide which champ to give the next big rework to.\"_\n\nWhich seems wrong to me.\nReworks shouldn't be something that you are actively looking for.\nThey should be things that pop out at you.\nIf a champ is obviously hideous, obviously unbalanced, and obviously despised, then give them a rework!\nYou shouldn't have to walk around with a magnifying glass, scoping out your next victim. \nIf a champ needs a full rework, it'll be obvious like Urgot.\nIf you have to look for it, then obviously no one is bad enough to need one.\n\n\n\n\n_Sorry for the long post, but they announced a rework for my favourite champ... \nI'm still sore...._\n\n_________\n\n\n**TL;DR:\nA rework is like someone running over your beloved dog, going out and buying you another of the same breed and saying: _\"Why are you upset, you've still got a dog!\"_**","replies":[]},{"poster":"SEKAI","date":"2017-06-23T11:30:31.022+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Why, many of the older champs have badly designed kit mechanically, thematically or both, or are just plain broken and will never be balance-able (check out Poppy's old R). That's why they do reworks.\n\nChamps would receive mini-reworks if their kit is not too much problem to balance reasonably or that there is nothing that makes no sense thematically. They could also receive no reworks and just VU like in the case of Twitch for example (though Riot probably has regretted that, given that they've probably realised now a stealth assassin with monster scaling and team shred isn't a exactly the greatest idea).\n\nJust releasing champs is not going to solve the problem, those champs have to be reworked. So it's better done sooner than later, Riot has waited long enough anyway, check out Urgot, he's been left in the dumpster for like 7 years or something before finally getting his rework.","replies":[{"poster":"Lord Sesshomaru","date":"2017-06-24T10:03:57.702+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I do agree that many champs just need a VU not a rework _(Karthus was a good example of this)_. But for some reason they don't want to do this anymore?\n\nand obviously champs like Poppy and Urgot needed to be reworked.\nLike you say, poppy's R was a little unbalanceable, and Urgot's R just makes 0 sense considering the rest of his kit and his theme.\n\nBut reworks like Zac are just 100% pointless.\nThey take a strong champ, one that fits his theme perfectly, and turn him into a monster!\nIt makes no sense.\n\nThey say they want to introduce greater strengths, but also greater weaknesses into champs. Well my question is: **Where is the greater weaknesses in updates like Zac/Brand?**","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Fitzky","date":"2017-06-23T10:20:25.796+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Because Riot can't balance champions for shit\nhttp://imgur.com/TdjDMof","replies":[]}]}
