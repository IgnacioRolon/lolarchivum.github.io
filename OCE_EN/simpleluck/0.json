It&#039;s super annoying and I know I should make the rune page before hand but I&#039;m jumping into draft even not knowing where I will be and just wanting to make the runes as I go.\n\nPlease make an option where it stops doing that lock thingy, because I just want to make my runes in peace having a hex flash on thresh instead of that recommended Resolve rune page without one.  I&#039;m not the fastest rune page maker especially when it just came out :/ Just some feedback.","replies":[{"poster":"JasonWazza","date":"2017-11-07T07:57:28.249+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I mean the main issue is that Riot said that they would give us 15 extra seconds for Rune pages and shit....\n\nDraft doesn't get any extra time added to it.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Django UnJaned","date":"2017-11-07T23:26:43.753+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"That's a bug we're fixing right now!
