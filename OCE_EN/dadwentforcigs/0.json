Would love to know if anyone else apart from me and a friend is having the problem of loading into league only to have it like somehow forcefully mute your mic? Like no changeable settings will fix it unless I unplug and re plug it in, which makes the game crash half the time and from then on I lag at the most random bs times. Is this a normal thing or am I just to fucking high? Please... just an explanation, a solution would make me just cream.","replies":[{"poster":"PLAYER47","date":"2018-07-20T19:36:19.453+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Have you checked your clients settings under voice?\nYou might have the \"Mute me when I connect to league of legends voice\" box checked.","replies":[{"poster":"DadWentForCigs","date":"2018-07-30T10:43:18.399+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Wasn't fixing it and it seems it has stopped after a few days of posting, thank thy lords.","replies":[]}]}]}
