Its why matchmaking looks a little weird when you compare them. \n\nJust like in ranked, new accounts in normals have a pretty decent MMR because they haven't really played enough to settle. You will also find that often high ranked players end up in normals with relatively low level/ranked players because they just dont tend to play normals as much. \n\nYou also have to consider things like what time of day it is (things are weirder during late at night and during the day with work/school hours) and if people are playing premade. All of this has an impact on matchmaking.","replies":[]}]}
