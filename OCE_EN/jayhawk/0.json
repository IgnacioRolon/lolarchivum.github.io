So I sent in a support ticket and got this response:\n\nhttps://i.imgur.com/n6TIY1k.jpg\n\nI waited a few days because I recognise that it can maybe take some time and it was possible that the player could have stopped playing for a bit and so not many reports may have come in or there may not have been much of a sample to look at. However, I checked their OP.GG this morning and came across this:\n\nhttps://i.imgur.com/KkZXgPR.jpg\nhttps://i.imgur.com/rILAMSQ.jpg\nhttps://i.imgur.com/a4TjzUL.jpg\nhttps://i.imgur.com/JmZXwj6.jpg\nhttps://i.imgur.com/X1FKQi2.jpg\nhttps://i.imgur.com/91hY0DA.jpg\n\nThere&#039;s actually so many matches between my game with them and their most recent that the game we played doesn&#039;t appear in his last 36 games shown here and there are 0 games on this account recorded on OP.GG for the last week where they haven&#039;t trolled.\n\nTo the Rioter who responded to my ticket, I&#039;m sorry, but if you expect me or anyone else to believe that your system actually deals with intentional feeding or trolling in a reasonable manner when it&#039;s not someone hehe xding it down mid into their opponent&#039;s fountain, it&#039;s going to take a lot more than just your assurances that things will get done eventually. \n\nI haven&#039;t seen this player since, but there has to have been 320+ players negatively impacted by this person&#039;s gameplay since I played with them and many more before that with no discernible punishment or ban placed on the account. If that&#039;s how the system works, it&#039;s really not going to encourage anyone to take it seriously compared to what is clearly evidenced by the bans issued for chat infractions.","replies":[{"poster":"Fitzky","date":"2018-02-05T03:19:05.373+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":3,"body":"Yet again more proof of Riot and their shitty banning system, too bad this post will just be seen as toxicity and not taken seriously.

It’snot uncommon, the emissaries give you a human presence to ask questions to.

Only not-for-profit organisations and charities can engage volunteers in designated volunteer positions.\n\nThese organisations cover a wide range of activities and interests, such as community organisations, health (for example, hospital services and programs), welfare, sport and recreation, conservation, emergency services, environment, arts and education sectors as well as special public event involvement.\n\nIn addition to this, local government and councils run various community service programs that use volunteers such as day centres for the elderly, youth centres, children’s activities in libraries and bush regeneration activities.\n\nCorporations and private companies (for-profit) cannot involve volunteers from outside their organisation. They can involve their own employees in volunteering projects or programs for community benefit. This is commonly referred to as ‘Corporate Volunteering’ or ‘Employee Volunteering’. Not-for-profit organisations willing, ready and able to engage with corporations can benefit greatly from this type of volunteer contribution. Volunteering NSW helps match corporate volunteers with not-for-profit organisations and volunteer opportunities.\"\n\nAlso if you take a look at this (too much to copy paste) https://www.fairwork.gov.au/how-we-will-help/templates-and-guides/fact-sheets/unpaid-work/unpaid-work#lawful you will see the details of it all. According to fair work (which you will notice never lists corporations as an organisation you 'volunteer' for) this is unlawful. Even if they started calling themselves 'interns' it would be unlawful. The law is actually crystal clear but for some reason you are denying it.\n\nYou also don't seem to realise that hospitals and churches are treated differently even if they are privately owned. I did make it pretty clear that it is \"corporations/private companies\" which hospitals and churches generally are not considered to be. But as a side note, just because some company does it, does not prove that it is legal. Might surprise you, but corporations are the biggest law breakers out there.\n\nalso they do more than just \"answer questions\". they are moderators, which IS a job that people get paid to do.
