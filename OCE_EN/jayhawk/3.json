In a game against her, I stood directly on top of one of her tunnels she was ulting to, destroying it well before she reached the tunnel. Thinking it would have cancelled or stopped her movement, I assumed I was safe to then engage the champ in front of me. But then I was instagibbed because Rek'Sai got to the exact point the tunnel was at before it was destroyed and killed me. \r\n\r\nCan you either make the tunnel invulnerable so that it's clear she can still get to it or nerf her ult so that she stops at the next available point if the tunnel she is ulting to is destroyed. In the heat of the moment, I'd probably forget some fact like that and to be honest, I hate playing against Rek'Sai at the best of times, clarity issues like that are just annoying.","replies":[{"poster":"hðnkƒørÇªmíllè","date":"2014-12-30T12:40:50.813+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":2,"body":"I don't think {{summoner:13}} is supposed to be taken on Rek'sai, you'll most likely get reported if you do.","replies":[]},{"poster":"SEKAI","date":"2014-12-30T13:13:35.055+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"Yes, agree with OP.\n\nNeed more clarity on the relation between ulti and tunnels.","replies":[]},{"poster":"KingDinger","date":"2015-01-01T01:22:03.377+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"if she has already started the channel for ulty there is no reason killing the tunnel should waste her ult. that would be over powered in situations where you are in place to do that. meaning it would become an even worse version of TFs ult where you HAVE to do it away from the enemy and not try for MLG pro engages with it.\nactually, new idea. if they add that part, destroying tunnel during channel stops ult. then during the travel, the ult does 1000 true damage to anything it touches and knocks up for 1.25 seconds. then it would be slightly balanced.","replies":[{"poster":"Jayhawk","date":"2015-01-01T23:09:49.667+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I accounted for that, I said make the tunnel indestructible so it's more obvious that you can't stop her OR make what is clearly an obvious nerf and make the ult end if it's destroyed. It isn't clear right now and Riot has been continually talking about clarity within the game. That isn't clear at all, she just appears out of nothing, I don't mind which way they do it, I just hope they do something to make it more obvious that she will still be coming regardless of whether you're standing on the tunnel or not.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Akuen","date":"2014-12-30T16:59:57.303+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'm reasonably sure that if you destroy a tunnel before Rek'Sai ults to it, her ult will be cancelled.
