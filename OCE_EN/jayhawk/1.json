It doesn&#039;t. So I think you really need to update the wording of this ability for clarity&#039;s sake because it clearly doesn&#039;t remove all disables. And before you ask, yes, I got #rekt by not knowing this and am pretty salty about it.\r\n\r\nAlso, just checked the Wiki and it does a better job of explaining it than your tooltip does. Why not use theirs?\r\n\r\nCleanse\r\n_Removes all disables (excluding Suppression) and summoner spells debuffs affecting your champion and grants 65% crowd control reduction for 3 seconds._","replies":[{"poster":"HORSE OF FORCE","date":"2015-06-23T03:51:44.540+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Suppresion was originally described as severing the connection that a summoner has to their champion, rendering them unable to perform any action while still under the influence of Summoner's Rift. But now summoner's don't exist anymore and the champions are suffering delusional memory loss, so who cares anymore?\n\nAnyway, point being, suppression was meant to be the \"ultimate\" form of crowd control, that would prevent a summoner from assisting their champion at all. You can't cast any summoner spells while suppressed.\n\nCleanse should be reworded to what you've suggested. Even though suppression is worded specifically to say it can't be removed, it's still a bummer to have to go and look that up when you have a spell that supposedly removes \"all disables\".\n\nThis post would probably be better suited in [Player Creations](http://boards.oce.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/player-creations). Or head to the NA boards and find the better category.","replies":[]}]}
