This indicates that you deserve to be where you are, even of you do go on occasional win streaks (everyone does). Also, the vague MMR calculator states your MMR at nearly 200 less than where it should be, hence your low MMR gain and high MMR losses as the system is trying to match you at a skill level where you are winning the majority of your games.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Lethal Ninja","date":"2015-03-03T13:58:09.313+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"what tier are you in?","replies":[]},{"poster":"Deche","date":"2015-03-03T12:24:50.109+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"LP is not calculated depending on how many ranked games you win. \n\nWhen in game a total MMR is calculated for both teams. MMR is the chance your team would win. So if you have higher MMR then you will get less LP but when your MMR is lower than the other team you get higher.\n\nSo since you won a few games in a row you are generally a higher mmr than those in your league you receive less LP. But it really is a weird system and don't think it works well.","replies":[]}]}
