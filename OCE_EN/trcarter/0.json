I could understand that if the other players didnt have a lot more deaths then me but I just dont understand how come I get constant low grades but people who are average get S rankings. please explain how the rankings are assigned so players and myself can understand.\n\nIt is making it very disheartening when you try soooo hard to play well and some scrub comes along plays like shit and beats you in their rankings\n\nI would attach a screen shot but match history&#039;s are down again... :(\n\nEdit... just played another ranked game - Lux support got S- ranking 6/4/23 and 74 cs - Me 9/10/21 - 75 cs apparently that gets me a B- as a jungle\n\nCan riot please explain this to me as my roll as a jungler was to gank and enable kills for other lanes I had more kill paticipations then everyone other then the ADC who played awesome... no S for him either - 23/7/12 and Highest gold in the game but he didnt get an S either????

The biggest thing to understand is you aren't graded against your team or the enemy team, rather you are graded against other players playing that champ in that position. \n\n> [Itâ€™s based on the champion and role that you just played in a game. So, for example, **we look at Annie mid differently to Annie support**. We take a series of performance metrics and compare how you do to all other players in your region in your champion / position combination. **It is percentile driven - so earning a high score means you performed in the top x% of players on that champ in that position.** The grade itself governs the point gains.](http://na.leagueoflegends.com/en/page/features/champion-mastery)\n\nIt's graded on a bell curve, with S+ being the top x% (around 1 or 2% if memory serves) of scores on that champ in that position. Things like ward placements and objective kills/assists will likely increase your score.","replies":[]}]}
