I have officially given up ranked. I have been in gold 2 8 times this season as soon as I get close instant dead zone of players that have admitted in chat they brought there accounts or Smurf. \n\nA gold or plat account that losses lane hard 1/14  check there match history and it’s all the same just loss after loss after loss. I tried changing it up going jungle gets objectives first tower and drags still gets flamed by the team whole game...\n\nNo teamwork\nPeople can just buy accounts ( when they clearly cannot play at the elo) \nThe most toxic community I have ever seen. Even enough to get trolled on the forums if you post something. \n\nIs it worth your mental sanity to continue playing a game that does not invest in its players views/ideals.\n\nI don’t need to provide evidence cause I know people also troll on the forums not mentioning one name and if you do find this thread you will still not get the satisfaction by me replying to any of your comments. \n\nBut in the general sense I get you, people are trolls always get in promos I got a teemo jg just troll yasuo picks majority of riven always feed say gg after 2 deaths. I didn’t think someone could get to gold or higher and still have that mentality........\n\nAnd not to mention the thousands of Players that speak another language during the game don’t speak English in a OCE server loose game hard in ranked it’s just no longer a competitor mode... from my experience and other league players I know in real life.","replies":[{"poster":"Miyokii","date":"2019-09-11T07:51:29.602+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I know it's pretty annoying :(","replies":[{"poster":"SeibaPendragon","date":"2019-09-12T03:21:59.017+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yeah dude honestly i am just leaving ranked solo duo for a while until its better...
