I was not suprised nor spooked as I cleaned up every last soul on summoners rift winning 10 out of 10 of my placement games. Keep in mind that I was Bronze 3 to finish off the last season carrying all of my games in that elo only to be let down by the unskilled and unpolished mechanics of &#039;Bronzies&#039;. In high hopes of winning all of my placements I saw a beam of hope that I would be put with players that are based around my skill level (silver to low gold). But I was outraged as I was placed in to Bronze 5, three ranks lower than the rank I finished at last season! This is absolute crap if you ask me, how could I be demoted after winning every single one of my games? I may as well should&#039;ve lost all my games and won 0/10 to obtain to same rank.\r\nI have invested 100s of dollars into this game only to be let down by the sloppy management of the league of legends committee not fully assessing and understanding the importance of the placement games for players. Thank you Riot Games for yet again making this a positive experience for me in league of legends, I have also invested not just money into this game but my own personal time that has been sabotaged by your poor ranking system.\r\nI would dearly appreciate it if you where to overlook my placement and place me into a rank that is most suited with the amount of games I won in my placements and two how I played and performed in those games.\r\nThanks you for your time, I love this game but this may be the hole in your fortress \r\nIGM : Just a Smurf","replies":[{"poster":"Partihard","date":"2016-09-27T16:57:57.960+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":1,"body":"Riot Provisional System is clearly broken. What's the point of a reset, or so a \"clean slate\" as RIOT says for the season and re-doing placements.  If from what I am reading here is correct. The guy placed b5 after winning 10/10 placement games. Clean Slate or Reset has no meaning. Placements have no meaning. Opening a new account and starting over to place higher in a division with same 10/10 placements is just a RIOT scam to spend more money to build runes, characters etc from scratch. Your spending is going to be lot more all over again on a new account vs existing account. This Placement system is just another scam by gaming company as RIOT. Where they they take pride in selling the idea of professional gaming of players that have abandoned education to pursue Professional gaming by spending 1000's of hours and you can be one too if you spend 14 hours a day playing there game. More hours + more accounts = more profit. And few really make it to top and the fact all tell their stories on videos that this is life and they have achieved something great at the age of 22 cause school is not for them is absolutely ridiculous. This company should be ashamed how they market this crap to benefit off young kids by sending the wrong message.","replies":[{"poster":"CtrlAltD3F34T","date":"2016-10-16T22:19:36.233+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":4,"body":"you cant buy rune with money. only IP, get off your conspiracy theory high horse.

Your MMR matters more than the actual placements, so most people will typically get placed in a similar division as what they were.\n\nBoy, I sure feel like the placement matches should be an opportunity to have somewhat of a clean slate, not just 10 more matches at the same exact elo you were at, except slightly lower, and you can't see until you've played 10.  It's hard enough to move around in solo ranked queue.  They should be trying to see how well I play against silver players, not how well I do with people on my team who can't figure out not to switch over to Facebook in the middle of a game, or who take graves in the jungle, or who don't realize that we already have a top lane, and pick one anyway.  (I'll give you a preview - I didn't win those matches.  Well good news, guess it doesn't matter anyway!)","replies":[]},{"poster":"Just a Smurf","date":"2016-01-21T01:10:17.546+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I finished last season as Bronze 3","replies":[{"poster":"Just a Smurf","date":"2016-01-21T01:10:45.314+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"So doesnt that mean I should get something higher as I was playing with bronze 3s?","replies":[{"poster":"rohitugnait","date":"2016-02-04T02:43:50.469+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"i know how you feel me and my friends won 10/10 and 1 got bronze 1 the other got bronze 4 and i got bronze 5","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"DaDrShrey","date":"2016-01-21T02:50:42.360+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":3,"body":"I think that just cos you won all your games, doesnt mean that you carried.

So just because you win games doesnt really mean that you are good. I think that your MMR starts with somewhere lower than what you currently are and you have to bring it up basically by carrying like almost every game. \n\n So I know for sure that my MMR right now is bronze 5 even though I was bronze 4 last season.

Maybe at the end of each month you give someone a promotional series and they have the chance to play a couple games against someone in a higher elo and if they can win the series they can jump there. Like fuck, anything is better than this flawed system. It honestly is starting to deter me from this game, and I'm sure a lot of other gamers are feeling the same way. And btw riot, stop banning people for raging in game, you brought this upon yourself - 1. Matchmaking system is broken, when you play the game half decent and get paired with people who legit plays like a bot, what do you thinks going to happen? 2. You give us access to chatting to the opposite team (what you think we are are going to say to them? hey man hows your day?) its a competitive game, shit talk is part of every competitive game... 2k16 is full of a bunch of pussies who get offended from anything. 2. give us a friggin in game actual audio chat... can guarantee it would cut the cancer in half because people are hesitant to use voice.
