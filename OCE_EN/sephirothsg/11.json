This is merely testing to the closest address that responds during a traceroute to those addresses, thus the results may not be 100% accurate to your in-game results however it&#039;s as good as I can get. \n\nDL link: http://168.235.67.241/res/pingtest.bat\n\nUnlike the tool posted by Rikka [here](http://boards.oce.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/player-creations/E9KBE6Bn-i-made-a-ping-tester-for-oce-so-you-can-test-ping-pre-game) this is not closed source (as it's a batch file) thus you can analyze the file for yourself to look for malicious content, nor is this file located behind an adfly link thus I don't generate revenue for you simply loading the page to download the file.","replies":[{"poster":"SephirothSG","date":"2016-02-15T10:32:24.539+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Updated to fix OCE IP.","replies":[{"poster":"Fluked","date":"2016-03-23T15:42:33.716+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thanks!

I know I noticed at least a 50ms increase on NA the last time I played there.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"SephirothSG","date":"2016-08-08T08:02:50.691+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Updated.\n\n* Dropped EUW2 and EUNE2.\n* Rename EU to EUW.\n* Change download link to something more permanent.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Madridista95","date":"2016-08-05T06:04:19.642+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thanks for the tool, works awesome!  but Non closed source?
