Is there any way to revert the log in back to the screens where it looked really nice with either the latest skin in an animated way or the pro league advertising.  Even though I never paid too much attention too it, I would much prefer to have it back, and the collection back too please. Is there any way to revert back to the (personal opinion) better more aesthtically pleasing  screens, and could there be any way to have the in game loading screen changed back to the s5 version to? please","replies":[]},{"poster":"DBkouen","date":"2019-07-04T07:17:40.999+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"when i logged in it says i'm spectating and i can't open my profile and play the game, then when i received an invite to join a party it says on hold, i tried to restart my client and my pc a few times and it still doesn't work, can someone tell me what's happening?","replies":[{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2019-07-04T08:49:29.970+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Seems like it might be some variant of a ghost game.
