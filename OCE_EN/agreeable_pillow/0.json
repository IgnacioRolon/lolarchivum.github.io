He uses something called League Sharp and boosts other people in game. He has been doing this for around 4-5 months and he hasn&#039;t got banned. He brags to me about no one catching him and him never getting banned and its getting obnoxious. Is there a way to report him outside of the League of Legends client? I don&#039;t think Riot has any 3rd party detecting programs because then he would have been banned a while ago.","replies":[{"poster":"Tele","date":"2016-05-29T00:00:03.716+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey summoner,\n\nI know it can be really frustrating when guilty players seem to go unpunished for extended periods of time. It leads to a lot of confusion and doubt surrounding **Riot**'s punishment system.\n\n**_So I'd like to clear that up now:_**\n\n+ _Scripting_\n[Scripters are banned in waves](http://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/miscellaneous/AEVP3NMA-anti-cheater-banwave-incoming). This is done to ensure that they don't know when or how they were detected. It also makes it really hard to find exploits in the detection system.\n\n If your friend has been detected for scripting, he'll be riding on one of those ban waves. I know it can be frustrating when these people can continue playing for a few months, but hold tight the** system does work and is banning people as we speak.**\n\n+ _Elo Boosting _\n**Riot** has many systems in place to [detect elo boosting](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/204168430-MMR-Boosting-Detection). They scan for unusual account behavior and patterns, then a **Rioter** will double check over everything to eliminate false positives. To my knowledge, it's the only system being constantly double checked by real **Riot** employees ATM.\n\n However because of this, unless **Riot** is 100% sure that elo boosting is occurring, they won't issue punishment. Perma-bans are very easy to get through boosting, so it's not worth the risk to punish innocent players on the possibility that they were boosted.\n\n**_\n\n> _As a last comment:_\n> I would recommend you tell your friend to stop elo boosting and using scripts. There's a small possibility that he hasn't been detected yet or that the punishment might not be as harsh. \n\n> If he keeps going he'll just provide more and more evidence for **Riot** to perma-ban him.\n> \n\nI hope this answered your question!","replies":[]},{"poster":"Waysted1","date":"2016-06-29T02:53:35.441+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"remind him that he isnt playing leagues at all, his scripts are doing it for him. does he need scripts to wipe his bum too? he weakens himself every time he does it. i saw a youtube vid where this guy had been scripting for years and decided to stop. he said it was like starting the whole game again except he knew about items etc. leagues is his favorite game and he didnt know how to play it.....let that sink in a little.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Richard Busby","date":"2016-06-06T06:33:20.761+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"they don't have any cheat detection \n\ntrust me","replies":[]},{"poster":"JasonWazza","date":"2016-05-28T12:23:37.921+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"If he is boosting, he personally wouldn't get banned anyway, that account being boosted would.","replies":[{"poster":"TheeRash","date":"2016-05-28T12:29:21.137+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=JasonWazza,realm=OCE,application-id=T8eq2lFQ,discussion-id=usEUMIGR,comment-id=0000,timestamp=2016-05-28T12:23:37.921+0000)\n>\n> If he is boosting, he personally wouldn&#x27;t get banned anyway, that account being boosted would.\n\nHe is boosting via scripting.","replies":[{"poster":"JasonWazza","date":"2016-05-28T13:25:19.315+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Generally you don't boost on your own account, so again, the person who he boosts will get banned for being boosted AND scripting.","replies":[{"poster":"Agreeable Pillow","date":"2016-05-28T13:34:00.007+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I should have gave more context.
