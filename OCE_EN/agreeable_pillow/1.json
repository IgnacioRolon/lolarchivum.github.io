It might depend on the specific ability though.\n\n> Does adding a point in an ability while it is going off such as Ashe's ult, Fiddles ult etc. , increase the statistics of the ult?\n\nDepending on the ability it *might* increase the stats of the currently active ability. Keyword \"might\"\n\n> When I add a point in an ability while it is on cooldown, does the cooldown decrease (for abilities that reduce the cooldown when adding points into them)?\n\nNo. The cooldown will only be reduced after the next cast as the result of a point being put into the ability, not while it's on cooldown.","replies":[]}]}
