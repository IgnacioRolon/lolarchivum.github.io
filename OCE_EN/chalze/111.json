As I understand it, the in-game prompt you're referring to is actually the one that pops--up when you attempt to leave, while the \"inactivity notice\" (which should come up before you get marked as \"AFK\", as I understand it) talks more about how being AFK can incur penalties. It seems weird that the post-game message would have come up if Leavebuster didn't get triggered, but that shouldn't have happened if you hadn't got the \"inactivity notice\" in-game.\n\nYou might want to try contacting [Support](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/requests/new) and see if they can help, or at least give you a clear understanding of what happened. Be sure to ask specifically for what you want, as they'll generally only respond to what is asked (if they can give a \"yes/no\" answer, they probably will).","replies":[]},{"poster":"Klavinmour","date":"2018-05-12T11:49:53.835+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"That would be a lot of bullshit.\n\nIf you're waiting for 20 gold, that's nowhere near the 5 minute mark where the message pops up.","replies":[]}]}
