The game played out and for some reason I became practically the most fed in the entire game at around 18 kills if I remember correctly (probably not but a ton). My score at the time was a perfect 18/0 and once we got to the base, they surrendered so I was like lol good game boiz and I went in 1v5 cuz Yolo right, we&#039;ve won the game. So I 1v5 under their turret, obviously died in the last second before the nexus exploded, and after the game I was awarded with an A+.\n\nMoral of the story boiz, don&#039;t do anything stupid even when you&#039;re fed af :&#039;( would&#039;ve been the most free S in my life\n\nEdit: This ain't a boast post, everyone on their team was raging at their Yasuo cuz he was actually really bad, I just got extremely lucky","replies":[{"poster":"PuncakesssR","date":"2016-09-22T08:43:43.764+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Your KDA isnt the only thing that counts towards an S rank, Pretty much everything thing you do in said game counts towards it. like your CS, Objectives etc.","replies":[{"poster":"Chalze","date":"2016-09-23T08:31:56.847+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=PuncakesssR,realm=OCE,application-id=Ntey9fRZ,discussion-id=yGyn1YNO,comment-id=0000,timestamp=2016-09-22T08:43:43.764+0000)\n>\n> Your KDA isnt the only thing that counts towards an S rank, Pretty much everything thing you do in said game counts towards it. like your CS, Objectives etc.\n\nMy other stats were good enough for an S- at least, except for that one death/shut down.\n\n> [{quoted}](name=Knuuckles,realm=OCE,application-id=Ntey9fRZ,discussion-id=yGyn1YNO,comment-id=00010000,timestamp=2016-09-22T09:40:33.752+0000)\n>\n> Possible the worst analogy I&#x27;ve read in my days\n\nStill made me lol though xD\n\n> [{quoted}](name=Ascalon127,realm=OCE,application-id=Ntey9fRZ,discussion-id=yGyn1YNO,comment-id=00000000,timestamp=2016-09-22T23:20:40.983+0000)\n>\n> Also the time period it happened in.
