It does the normal damage plus the lichbane damage. 75% of base AD though, so the blue number not the green (when you hover over your AD)","replies":[]},{"poster":"Project Xayah","date":"2014-12-12T01:58:30.331+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You could read the description of the item and you'll have your answer.
