Damn, I thought it was quite common, it's really good since there's literally 100% customization for itemization, makes things quicker.","replies":[{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2016-11-10T23:53:01.753+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Item Sets aren't being revoked, they'll just take a little to re-implement after beta client rolls out.

I'd recommend either posting over in Help and Support so our wrenchmen see it, or submitting a support ticket as player support should also be able to help you.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"LevvyLeviticus","date":"2016-11-10T21:01:45.257+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Could be because they're revoking the item set choice as only 3% of players used it.","replies":[{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2016-11-10T23:50:58.731+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> WILL THE UPDATED CLIENT HAVE THE SAME FEATURES AS THE CURRENT CLIENT?\n> The updated client is where we'll release all new client features (like Replays), and there are a few things that may take a few patches to to re-implement after open beta gets going. One feature that isn't being immediately brought over from the legacy client are item sets. However, your existing item sets will still continue to work and our third-party API will still allow you to download custom item sets from community developers for in-game use.","replies":[]}]}]}
