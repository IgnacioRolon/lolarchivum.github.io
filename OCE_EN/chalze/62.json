Cuz seriously, he's not that weak, if a Bronzie like me can carry with him then you know that he's not that weak...\n\nDoes it just mean that he really really REALLY suits my play style? Cuz honestly I really don't believe I'm that much better than my peers...to me, Kassadin's actually quite face roll if you can manage to get a few kills early (and avoid dying which isn't that hard anyway)...\n\n{{champion:38}} {{champion:38}} {{champion:38}} {{champion:38}} {{champion:38}} {{champion:38}} {{champion:38}} {{champion:38}} {{champion:38}} {{champion:38}} {{champion:38}} {{champion:38}} {{champion:38}} {{champion:38}} {{champion:38}}","replies":[{"poster":"Gloric","date":"2015-03-16T02:54:08.759+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Shyvana is regarded as weak at current since her early game both in jg (can't clear at start, low health if you want to try to gank, etc..) and her lane is weak (as her exchange is bad). But 9/10 games I play her, I dominate and carry. the 1/10 either of many things, either I just do badly, make bad choices with ganks, or team does bad and there's no way I can catch up to their 0/20 lead at the 12 minute mark.\n\nPeople in low elo, like myself, but unlike myself, are often far too obsessed with \"what's best\" according to this or that guide, when they can barely do the basics. Can't click their mouse properly and are unable to pay attention to what's going on around them. \nI play what I like, most of which are not prime choices according to what this or that guide says. Shyv, Vlad, Sion, my 3 favs, definitely not popular at current, but I also think underrated.\n\nBut yeah, I think it comes down to your own playstyle, as said. I think I might just be more suited to a semi-tactical, semi-strategic role, ie. engaging with good gank skills such as Sion's R and Shyv's R, as well as judging when to run or approach/hit-and-run with Vlad's playstyle.\n\nAnother thing though, could be that the players you're going up against just aren't ready for the champ you're playing, because they haven't played against them for awhile due to their unpopularity.\nI think that's the reason for my success with Sion, in the lower brackets, people just don't see him much, so I pretty much get a 100% stun rate with my Q (which has won me a lot of games with him, whether as jg or playing support), and I can't count the number of times i've had a low health mage try to exchange with me as Shyv at full health, and i'll just R in and nuke them in half a second, because they probably just aren't aware that Shyv's ult can be up within no time of being used.\n\nSo yeah, it might make a difference if you're a super computer Diamond/Challenger, but I doubt it'll make any difference below that level. Play what you want.","replies":[{"poster":"Chalze","date":"2015-03-16T05:54:25.886+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You like Shyvana?\n\nEnjoy her buffs to her E then aye :)\nI shall enjoy Kassadin as how he is now even though he's still regarded as super-sht lol","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Migit78","date":"2015-03-15T11:29:18.072+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Like you said you're probably just doing well on the champion. He suits your play style.\n\nKassadin has always been a strong pick, especially if you can pick up a kill or 2 in the early game.\nJust the recent nerf to his Ult range annoyed a lot of Kassadin players because it makes him more suseptable to damage when attempting to land his combos.\n\nHowever if you can play regardless of the change, I would continue to play him","replies":[]}]}
