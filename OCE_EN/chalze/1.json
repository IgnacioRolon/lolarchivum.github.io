The addition of attack speed is useful of Thresh because it means his passive is proceed more too. To be honest though, it is a high-risk, low reward build. Like tank Thresh, he still gains AP to improve his abilities too.\n\nHowever...\n\"His basic attack wind up is only reduced by 0.25% per 1% attack speed, rather than the standard 1%.\" - The LoL wiki.\nThey implemented this change sometimes after his release. Thresh used to be better as AD Thresh, and the idea still exists although it is not as good as it used to.\n\nMy view: AD Thresh can be done but why bother? You can do AD Bruiser Thresh, I think, but an ADC build for him is just %%%%.\n\nTL;DR - if you want to do this, there are better champions. If you want to trade AD scales for utility as an ADC, I believe there are better champs for this. To be honest, I am surprised that I don't see more ADC Lulus since I see ADC Threshs. Her autos change normally, and she still gets magic damage from her passive while having utility. However, I still wouldn't really use her as an ADC.","replies":[]}]}
