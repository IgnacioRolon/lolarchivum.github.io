It’s like gambing, the system lets you win something great in the beginning, gets your attention, and then makes you spend money on it more and more hoping you’ll get the same luck.\r\nNow I did get Riot K9 Nasus, assuming that Riot wanted to give me something “really good/rare/un-purchasable” as a starter since I’ve never used self Mystery Gifting until now. I just hope it’s correct to stay away from self Mystery Gifting from now since I’ve probably blown my “good luck” on the first one.\r\n\r\nThoughts anyone?\r\n\r\nRito what are your views on this?\r\n\r\n{{champion:75}} ~Doggy got this for sure~","replies":[{"poster":"Biggest Gimp OCE","date":"2014-12-02T03:52:46.256+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"my mate got pulsefire ez first go then third one he got spirit guard udyr","replies":[{"poster":"Lord Sesshomaru","date":"2014-12-02T05:42:44.083+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thats one lucky guy","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"P1 GTR","date":"2014-12-02T06:46:17.015+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yup Blitzcrank skins ftw....

For example I now have 2 nocturne skins, 3 cass skins, 2 tf skins and like 2 kat skins I think. These are all from self mystery gifts. It was so anoying but i can afford it so idk really, it's not like I'm blowing my rent money on it. I dunno if riot intends on the system being like this but it is quite off putting. My advice would be that if u want a certain skin just buy it for full price. The chances of getting the one u want is very very low.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Project Xayah","date":"2014-12-02T04:02:32.708+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Honestly I'd say it works something along the lines of: the higher the value of skin you get the more likely you are to get low value skins. So still a bit luck based but still trying to bait you into getting a lot.","replies":[]}]}
