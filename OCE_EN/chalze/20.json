I do somewhat feel like a good Kat post-rework can potentially be more devastating than a good Kat pre-rework, but that&#039;s just my opinion I guess :P","replies":[{"poster":"JasonWazza","date":"2016-11-09T09:44:42.217+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I mean give it a few days before you ask opinions, because opinions will be heavily biased.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Fitzky","date":"2016-11-09T08:53:15.073+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"gonna take a while for people to get good on her, first couple of games I've seen such a mess from kat players","replies":[]},{"poster":"xDarkRavenx","date":"2016-11-10T13:24:02.687+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"People haven't been playing the assassins much yet. Well I've only seen a Talon and a LeBlanc, but they had no pressure on the map at all since anyone could 1v1 them... a level 1 Annie beat a level 3 Talon in lane, but maybe that's because he was getting cocky since he's an assassin.\n\nEDIT: For some reason I just forgot my last game I had 2 Kats, but they did jack shit.

I like the flat armor pen rework because i'm a sole tank player and EXTREMELY HATED the league of ghostblade meta. \nI like the maw changes however the item getting cooldown reduction is a really good change, who cares about the item loosing armor pen it is a survival tool that is needed on alot of ad champions like gangplank.\n\nKatarina is now easier to lane verse and isnt a face-roll champion anymore because she used to have the pantheon playstyle: go into lane spam q on enemy, if they are low enough go all in, if I didnt get a kill roam with ult bot lane to get a double kill\nKha and rengar changes are alright rengar is more annoying to kite however and ALOT easier to predict.\nEkko honestly ekko has been a problem of a champion since the start of tank ekko thank god for the changes (STOP PLAYING TANK EKKO GO BACK TO AP EKKO)\nShaco: his passive cooldown is such a good change SUCH a good change.\nZed is now playable in higher elo but just the same of a monster people think he is in low elo. However he still needs nerfs because just a zed being in the game forces alot of players to take exhaust mid (its unhealthy for a champion to force you to take a certain summoner spell)\nFizz: the ult changes look alright but they need to make it so you can either qss the ult or do something to unhook the shark.\nAkali: at least i get a few more seconds to relax before i get all in'd at level 6 and die (EVEN THOUGH I HAVE STACKED MAGIC RESIST)\nLeblanc: from what i can tell alot of Leblanc mains don't like the change so i guess i can start playing mid lane karthus again.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Luciz1","date":"2016-11-09T14:06:52.218+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Just question to riot.

Yes, I understand it's due to counterplay that her burst through her passive needs 1.5 seconds to lock in, but eh, it's just not that fun needing to wait that 1.5 seconds in some situations. Also, the fact that her W has a brief delay before being able to pop back, even though it's a tiny delay, it's still incredibly noticeable. I guess if it makes her a more healthy champion then it's for the better :P","replies":[]},{"poster":"BarryButcher","date":"2016-11-09T09:42:26.992+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Talon is broken as fuck.
