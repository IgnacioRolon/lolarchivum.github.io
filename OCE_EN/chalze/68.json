I have my doubts about getting 10 splash arts. Maybe another 4 for the main, or maybe a second for darkness, but highly unlikely all 10 of them. The themes are so vastly different between them it'd pretty much be a brand new splash art for each just with similar compositions as far as pose and background go.\n\nBut like you, I'd love to have 10 new splash arts, I love the splashes Riot does. I'm just not holding out much hope :P","replies":[{"poster":"Chalze","date":"2016-11-26T09:01:25.412+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Well if Riot wants to up their game :P","replies":[]}]}]}
