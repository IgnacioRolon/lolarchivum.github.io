I&#039;m pretty sure Irelia&#039;s one is overdue since we had a preview of it sometime ago in LCS, and Warwick&#039;s probably won&#039;t come anytime soon since he might get reworked. Xin&#039;z is just begging for a re-splash, I mean, out of the 3 Demacian bros two of them (J4 &amp; Garen) both had new artworks.\r\n\r\nIn terms of remodeling, perhaps Evelynn, Ryze (it says everywhere that his model is finished...), definitely Nunu and perhaps classic Janna.\r\n\r\nI know some of these models may have gotten texture upgrades, but the models are just...eh...\r\n\r\nI didn&#039;t mention real obvious ones like Taric but thats cuz he&#039;s like Warwick and is probably getting an overhaul","replies":[]}
