But still, I know his itemizations, but does anyone have any tips for me?\r\n\r\nI do know at this stage I&#039;m far too distracted by his passive and trying to use those for CS rather than using autoattacks so that&#039;s something I&#039;m much more aware of, I&#039;ve also noticed that Aurelion can&#039;t use his Q as an instant stun so he can&#039;t peel for himself if the enemies get up real close. What do I do in this case? I know I can use my R, but that&#039;s an ultimate with a long cooldown...\r\n\r\n{{champion:136}} {{champion:136}} {{champion:136}} {{champion:136}} {{champion:136}} {{champion:136}} {{champion:136}} {{champion:136}} {{champion:136}}","replies":[{"poster":"Miicka","date":"2016-09-01T09:54:44.241+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"> Yasuo who I know to be quite broken in his current state\n\nYay another talon12 rant","replies":[{"poster":"Chalze","date":"2016-09-03T08:14:20.294+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Miicka,realm=OCE,application-id=FjGAIbRv,discussion-id=RpEqJWIK,comment-id=0006,timestamp=2016-09-01T09:54:44.241+0000)\n>\n> Yay another talon12 rant\n\nWell I mean he does have a 58% winrate (at a peak on some servers) and I mean...is insanely strong right now :P\n\nAt least against Aurelion Sol\n\n{{champion:136}} {{item:3031}} {{champion:157}} ","replies":[]},{"poster":"Lord Sesshomaru","date":"2016-09-01T12:51:33.365+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Only he can argue against the facts","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Requiemsfire","date":"2016-09-03T19:37:31.601+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Try aurelion top lane and slap them melee bruisers in the face with your spaceballs.\n\nIt's really tricky, you have to try and farm as much as you can, I seriously recommend practicing freezing the wave with him but that's a lot harder on aurelion than other champions simply because the stars will interfere with your last hitting in lane and deal damage to minions. Against divers and melee carries, I honestly just would say you're literally screwed in every sense of the word because they will zone you so hard and poking them will just result in them diving onto you and killing you. \n\nIt might be ideal to roam towards either bot lane or top because Aurelion's E is very efficient for ganking over terrain and cutting opponents off.
