Plants = angle with sword & angel with bow.  \nVoid Zyra - see above except darkness retracts inward on completion. Plants = Void plant melee & range \nProgram Zyra - like project/mecha/arcade - thinking along the lines of data transfer to morph into digitised abilities. Something similar to tron.\nScoceress Zyra - human version (ie. regarding her lore) sorceress that travelled into the woods. casting dulled down version of lux (in a nutshell)\n\nFurther ideas: \nAntlantian / Pool Party Zyra w/ seaweed beach theme\nOrder of the Lotus Zyra - fancy version of original skin\nElderwood Zyra - wooden/ more ornate/ accented version","replies":[]},{"poster":"Lonely Flame","date":"2015-03-22T00:01:43.004+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"So yeh tip for the future: Before posting check out the League of Legends wiki.
