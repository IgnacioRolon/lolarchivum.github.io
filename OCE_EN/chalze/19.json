The only way to beat Jax is to play cancer like Quinn and Lissandra top.","replies":[{"poster":"Klavinmour","date":"2014-11-28T07:23:47.812+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":2,"body":"It really isn't. I've played a lot of Jax {{champion:24}} (PAX Jax owner :P ) and I've faced a lot of Jax. He is terribly easy to kite, even if the Jax player knows how to ward jump.\n\nWhile yes Jax can typically out trade any ranged ADC, there are a bunch that can easily kite him, such as Draven{{champion:119}} , Kalista{{champion:429}}  and Vayne{{champion:67}} . These three typically have no trouble at all with dealing with Jax.\nI've also experienced Sivir {{champion:15}} being able to destroy Jax easily, but then again I play a lot of Sivir, one of my most favourite champs ever, have been playing her since S1.","replies":[{"poster":"csm","date":"2014-11-28T12:54:32.767+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Why feed the bronze troll?","replies":[{"poster":"Klavinmour","date":"2014-11-28T12:58:42.176+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Correcting isn't feeding, feeding a troll is to reply in a ragey and butt hurt form.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Chalze","date":"2014-11-28T08:06:34.025+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"> Jax doesn't need buffs..\n\nYeah I don't think he does aye xDD\n\n> They are just \"fixing\" Yasuo by giving him back his move speed.\n\nLol, that's good enough for me~\n\n{{champion:157}} {{item:3087}}","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"BarryButcher","date":"2014-11-28T06:40:15.165+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"They are just \"fixing\" Yasuo by giving him back his movespeed.\nLots of changes to junglers...
