I just had a game where as Lee Sin I did &#039;relatively well&#039; ending the game 4/2/4 and helping our Yas get a Quadra etc, when suddenly Rengar (enemy jungler) asked me if I was a &quot;normals hero&quot; seeing that I have around 1600 normal wins but have little to no progress/history in ranked at all. I mean as an extremely casual player I actually quite like the term &quot;norm hero&quot; even though &quot;hero&quot; exaggerates my 4/2/4 score which isn&#039;t insanely great anyway (I mean our Yasuo got a quadra, he should be the hero but eh). I&#039;ve been playing since Sept 2012 and have always been a casual player but this is the first time I&#039;ve been called that.\r\n\r\nWhat do you guys think? He said I should start to climb out of Bronze even though I&#039;m worse; I&#039;ve been essentially unranked for 3 seasons now.\r\n\r\n{{sticker:slayer-jinx-catface}}","replies":[{"poster":"Roguestoney","date":"2016-10-22T09:40:07.409+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"He was just salty nothing more to it.","replies":[{"poster":"Chalze","date":"2016-10-22T19:25:32.305+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Roguestoney,realm=OCE,application-id=Ntey9fRZ,discussion-id=UdKJfd1M,comment-id=0002,timestamp=2016-10-22T09:40:07.409+0000)\n>\n> He was just salty nothing more to it.\n\nNonono, he asked it as a genuine question, he wasn't salty/tilted in game (ok maybe a bit tilted gameplay-wise since I'm Lee and I have too many things to counter him with).
