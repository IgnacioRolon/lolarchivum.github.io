Our Jax who wasn&#039;t doing too well probably is on tilt, but he later had an argument trying to defend Blitz on saying how his disconnections aren&#039;t &#039;intentional&#039;. By my understandings, any kind of disconnections that results in the game being heavily swayed one way or another is a reportable offense, regardless of the cause. The only &#039;justifiable&#039; disconnection is if there&#039;s a problem on Riot&#039;s side which we can&#039;t help.\n\nNote that he was dropping in and out but his presence was still not enough to make a positive impact on the game, ending 0/0/0, thus it wasn&#039;t a &#039;remake-able&#039; situation.\n\nSo Jax keeps pushing on how the net issues aren&#039;t Blitz fault to which I argue it is, since the problem is on his side and the outcome of the disconnections. The way I see it is, is that regardless of whether it&#039;s intentional or not, any form of disconnection is a reportable offense, thus Blitz comes under this bracket since the problem is on his side. Jax then keeps pushing on how it&#039;s &quot;not his fault&quot; since it&#039;s unintentional to which I answer back saying it isn&#039;t his fault as an individual person, but as a bigger picture of the pronoun &quot;him/his&quot; meaning the individual sitting in front of his computer and playing the game through his own internet system, it is &#039;his&#039; fault as the issues fall under his own circumstances. And then Jax starts to attack me saying what kind of &#039;logic&#039; I&#039;m using.\n\nAm I wrong here? What&#039;s your view on issues like this? Note that Jax and I weren&#039;t arguing about whose fault it is, but rather whether it was a reportable offense or not.\n\n\nThanks guys!\n{{sticker:slayer-pantheon-thumbs}}","replies":[{"poster":"The Wanak King","date":"2016-11-04T01:18:03.110+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Its not \"Intentionally\" his fault, Like he has no control of how his ISP controls it \n\n however in the terms of use it is the individuals fault;\n\nII.

It's my responsibility! I totally expected a tree! That's some grade A biased logic. Yeah Gordon's got a fair noggin, the only time it'd be report-able in my opinion would be somebody who knows their experiencing problems but keeps trying to play rank again. That's like telling somebody they can't dress the way they want to in case of haters and only being able to ask for permission from 1 person on when they can change. Lol Gordon again.
