My favourite Annie skin is Panda Annie, but most people say Reverse Annie is the best skin.","replies":[{"poster":"Lord Sesshomaru","date":"2014-12-14T20:49:34.605+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I didn't meant put any less effort into it, i mean put effort into making it so the currently available skins acre more sought after to create a demand and get more money.\n\nI see what you mean and you are probably right, but to me it seems like every time they do a VU the legacy skin gets the best VU e.g. Phantom karthus, Riot singed\n\nthey way it seems to me is that before the upgrade no one cared about any of them, and now after the VU Phantom Karthus, Riot singed and Black Ali have gone from the skins no one cared about to the crowd favourite, at least from why i have heard other people say about them.\n\nit seems counter productive to me to have the unavailable skins as the favourites. \n\nbut thats just my two cents :P\n\nI'm with you there i prefer panda to reverse annie.","replies":[{"poster":"Klavinmour","date":"2014-12-14T21:21:49.866+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"For me Karthus is all about the Pentakill skin.
