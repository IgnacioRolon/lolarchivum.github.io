Her early game damage is horrendous, and until you get a few ranks in it or acquire quite a bit of AP, her W deals near negative damage. I don't know if this is factual, but I personally feel like Ahri spikes quite hard in the mid game, and doesn't tend to fall off too much, if you can cs really well in lane and not die, you'll be fine. If you can pick up a kill, even better. Ahri's kill pressure in lane doesn't come from strong all in damage, it comes from wearing down your opponents with E-Q-W's until they are low enough to kill, or, extended fights at level 6 where you are able to just outright outplay your opponents with your dashes.\n\nIn terms of your skill order, the standard one is R-Q-W-E. And as for your build a standard one against a balanced team is, Morellos-Sorcs-Dcap-Void-Zhonya's-Rylai's/Abyssal/Luden's/GA. Obviously varying it with an earlier Zhonya's, Abyssal or Athene's where appropriate.\n\nHere are a couple of tips to Ahri, I don't know if you need them, but then again, I don't really know what you mean by \"I can't play Ahri...\"\n\n. Landing your charm is no longer essential like old Ahri, though your damage output is greatly increased when landing it as it lines up all the rest of your skillshots, the charm itself does damage and quite a bit in the late game and your W orbs are drawn to Charmed targets.\n. Remember that your ult also does damage, (I know you probably know this but worth mentioning) in 1v1s, weaving AA's into your dashes while using them to dodge skillshots and wait for your cooldowns is essential. In teamfights, make sure you dash close enough for the orbs to go out to enemies, but far enough that your safe. \n. One problem that I sometimes have is, that W doesn't cast automatically after Q anymore, so make sure when you land a Charm, that you spam W right after Q until it goes off.\n. Remember that your Q deals more damage on the way back, very useful against tanks and finishing off the kill. It returns to you in whichever direction you've chosen to run in after sending it forward.\n\nHope I was helpful!","replies":[{"poster":"JasonWazza","date":"2015-03-26T11:15:14.901+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":">.
