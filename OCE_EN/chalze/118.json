But beware, I am Bronze so don't take my word in terms of 'high level gameplay'.\r\n\r\nKassadin and Irelia are both now on the run towards top contenders for 'OP' again even after nerf after nerf. So why is this happening?\r\n\r\nI remember picking up Irelia WAY back but just after she got nerfed the hell out of her. I got used to her and thought 'wow Irelia seems like she's still really strong at the moment' so I kept abusing how strong she is, having the DPS to shred tanks, the mobility of assassins, the tankiness of tanks, the inability of being locked down all the time and the burst and sustained damage of ADCs (nearly). So then I thought, why wasn't anyone using her?\r\nI asked the forums quite a lot, and everyone said \"because she was nerfed and now not as strong\". This basically translated to \"she's not good anymore since she was only good after the nerf, don't play her\" in player's minds. But not me. I kept abusing her and eventually now, she's picking herself up again as someone who is OP. Now more abused by others, more and more people realise how strong she still is, and I thought, well, at a certain point, people will find out and I will no longer be able to abuse her since she will be under Riot's nerf hammer again (maybe). Even GamingCurios hosted by JeremyC stated that Irelia is probably the most overpowered top lane bruiser now in 4.21\r\n\r\n\r\nSo what has this got to do with Kassadin?\r\nWell, as I've said before somewhere, I used to abuse Kassadin as well even after his nerf. I got used to Kassadin post-nerf, so I'm thinking his power level always was like this. Once I played 12 games as Kassadin in a row and lost only 1 (I had to afk lol). Seriously once he's rolling, holy crap he can instagib almost anyone. But really, what has Kassadin got to do with anything I said about Irelia?\r\n\r\nWell, for ages now Kassadin is said to be the only assassin with the damage of a support. I entirely disagree. This guy not only had a practical 100% win rate but also 100% ban rate, and for good reason. But then, he got nerfed on basically every single ability (except his W, I like the new W now). Both Q and E had an extra 100+ base damage before nerf and his R used to cost less mana. So then everyone thought he was crap. Everyone except me. I continued to abuse him, and I think now, same as Irelia, he's now feared AGAIN and making his way up to recognition as an overpowered champion, especially in the late game.\r\n\r\nSo, about these two champions, seriously. ABUSE THEM NOW BEFORE THEY GET NERFED AGAIN.","replies":[{"poster":"JasonWazza","date":"2015-01-05T08:50:40.644+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Generally speaking, every champion is strong, it's a matter of what's stronger, right now i would think Irelia is close to (if not) top tier if you can use her, she still has poor matchups and can be beaten.\n\nWhat defines a strong champion is less about their ability to do certain things well, and more to do with how much they can be countered (and how much everyone is aware of this.)\n\nFact is if you can play a champion really well, they are powerful (this goes like quadruple in bronze) especially the underpicked one's because of lack of known counters.","replies":[{"poster":"Chalze","date":"2015-01-05T20:58:00.355+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=JasonWazza,realm=OCE,application-id=FjGAIbRv,discussion-id=hFFN9yAb,comment-id=0000,timestamp=2015-01-05T08:50:40.644+0000)\n>\n> Generally speaking, every champion is strong, it's a matter of what's stronger, right now i would think Irelia is close to (if not) top tier if you can use her, she still has poor matchups and can be beaten.\n\nYeah but my point is, no one in low levels actually bother to use hard match ups against enemies...and even if they do it's most likely not their main/someone they're good at.

Irelia is still stronger than strong could be in my opinion. she has a tool that lets you fight healthier/stronger foes, built in true damage for shredding tanks and sustain on top of it. Her passive combined with tenacity from mercury treads and the new elixir, makes her super mobile and 'CC' resistant. People tend to shy away from champions if they even get nerfed in the slightest from what I have experienced, even if they remain strong afterwards.\n\nYeah that's the thing, but they're still both insanely strong at the moment.
