They do alot of damage but can also be very hard to kill due to stealth, lifesteal, mobility, cc or in a few cases just because they'll 100-0 you before you can do anything to fight back. That isn't to say that other champions can snowball because even a janna/soraka can snowball if she has enough kills+assists+levels to the point where she can 1v1 the enemy midlaner; but I feel these champions have really strong game ending potential if they get ahead and are really hard to win against if they're fed.","replies":[]},{"poster":"TheOneUser","date":"2016-08-19T12:53:45.338+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"trundle olaf cass + that new adc guy with a gun. anything auto attack reliant can snowball pretty well","replies":[]},{"poster":"BarryButcher","date":"2016-08-19T07:04:45.528+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"any assassin really.\n\nalso this fucker snowballs pretty hard {{champion:240}}","replies":[]},{"poster":"BananaSlayerAMO","date":"2016-08-19T06:25:10.952+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"LB, Fizz, Vayne, Jinx, Katarina, Teemo (imo as a Teemo main)","replies":[]}]}
