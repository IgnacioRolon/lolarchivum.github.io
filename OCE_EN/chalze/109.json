Imagine Morgana's Q already... but also realize there are a lot of point blank or instant abilities like Xerath and so on.\n\nI would feel like if they made this, it would be too strong or too weak like I said above which wouldn't really balance the game out. It has to at least slow down both movement speed and projectile of both teams just to make up for the slow projectiles or it could be really unhealthy for the game depending on how big of an area of effect it has.\n\nIt seems nice but really eh, just annoying, rude and something Riot has most likely thought about but threw in the trash.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Project Xayah","date":"2015-03-26T08:30:30.268+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Such a mechanic could possibly be applied to slows in general, so rather than just slowing move speed it also slows projectile speed. Most likely not a 1:1 ratio of move speed:projectile, something more like a 2:1 or 4:1 ratio (example: a 20% slow would slow projectiles by 5/10%). Probably mean slows would need to be nerfed though.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Zero Infinity","date":"2015-03-26T03:38:43.412+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Something like Bard's ult, but a bigger range :P, so everything moving in the area is drastically slowed.","replies":[]}]}
