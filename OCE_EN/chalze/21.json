But the meta has shifted to a point where other top lanners either counter him or at least can do well against him. His early game is weaker now as well which makes all the ranged bullies or high sustain champs do really well against him. So he's still just as good as always, just his lane opponents are harder to match up to.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Sackboy","date":"2015-03-16T13:48:16.817+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Holy fuck I haven't seen Jax played in about 5 months, lol.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Unseen Predator","date":"2015-03-16T08:47:55.978+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Because Irelia is the new Jax.","replies":[]},{"poster":"RNG Remilia","date":"2015-03-16T07:24:55.400+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Jax gets ruined by kiting + CC + burst and that's pretty much all this meta is atm.","replies":[]},{"poster":"GoldenTomat0","date":"2015-03-16T07:21:06.458+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"meta changed. ranged tops fuck him up. that's where irelia is stronger. so you pick her instead.","replies":[]},{"poster":"BarryButcher","date":"2015-03-16T06:48:47.097+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"His early game got nerfed so you have to be a good Jax instead of a mindless one for him to survive it early.
