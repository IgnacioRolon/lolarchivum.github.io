It wasn't to reward positive play, if that's what you think.\n\nRiot has found that giving away skins gets people into the habit of buying more skins. As such, the whole \"free skin\" is more likely than not just another way to promote the concept of buying skins, especially to the section of the market who hasn't bought a skin yet.\n\nEssentially, the mystery gifts are a psychological way to MAKE Riot money, even though it looks like they're being generous. Giving a refund point will do the opposite of that, which is why Riot avoids doing such things as all costs.\n\nThe only reason Riot provided refund points to begin with was to avoid spamming of the customer support with requests, and to make it look like they're being \"fair.\"","replies":[{"poster":"Chalze","date":"2015-01-17T19:15:20.936+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I know about the marketing strategies in that but still...can't Rito be a little nicer?\n\n*lolkimtryingtoohard*\n\n{{champion:268}} SHURIMA {{champion:268}} SHURIMA {{champion:268}} SHURIMA {{champion:268}}","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Blood Harvest","date":"2015-01-18T01:12:07.341+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I think its a bad idea, it was not announced and it was a little thank you, idc if you guys say its a marketing strat, they where being nice, be grateful you even got anything, most companies dont care and would not give away anything. \n\nBe grateful with what you have","replies":[{"poster":"Chalze","date":"2015-01-18T02:14:10.683+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Fair enough but it still is a marketing strategy, you gotta admit","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"csm","date":"2015-01-17T10:22:15.569+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"And what would you want the year after? 200 elo?","replies":[]},{"poster":"Chalze","date":"2015-01-17T07:24:00.233+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Or end of year, probs not end of S4 specifically","replies":[]}]}
