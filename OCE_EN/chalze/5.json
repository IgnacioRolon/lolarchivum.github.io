I think she might get a bit more play now that DFG gets removed, because she's never really relied on it. I think she is a good pick against many people. I tend to have a fun time against people like Yasuo against her in the sense that its an easy lane - easy to land snares on someone who must go melee and her snare gets rid of his passive shield before you can just do heaps of damage to him. Her single target damage kinda sucks in comparison to a lot of people though, but that is never gonna be the point of picking her. Utility is also nice, and her shield makes it easy to make a lot of trades, especially once you have a bit of AP. Also, she is pretty strong early on since she starts with her ultimate, even if it is pretty weak at that point in the game.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Night Blakey","date":"2015-02-03T05:23:30.661+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The thing is... other supports generally still have stuff to offer your team even when you get wrecked in lane.
