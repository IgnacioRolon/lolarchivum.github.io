I remember back in NA when all the gamemodes were available, and I would play LoL as much as I could depending on how much time I had to spare. If I had 10-15 minutes I had the option to queue up for Dominion. If I had 25-30 minutes I had the option to queue up for Twisted Treeline. If I had a full 45-50 minutes I would play the usual Summoners Rift. After transferring to OCE  I couldn&#039;t play as much as I wanted to because of the lack of Dom&amp;TT and I believe I am not the only one.\r\n\r\nHonestly, as players we want some &quot;mini&quot; LoL game-mode we could just play and queue up for whenever we had a decent amount of spare time. Now with Dominion gone, people who aren&#039;t able to play full games and can only manage to play Dominion (and perhaps only play Dominion because of it) will now be forced to quit League. I&#039;m not quitting, but I&#039;m definitely not happy to see one of my favorite gamemodes removed (especially when you guys basically threw off Dominion from us by making it unavailable anyway, now you&#039;re just putting the final nail on the coffin). \r\n\r\nWhy would you remove such a beloved gamemode? I could&#039;ve easily started off (and continuing to this day) to be a Dota fan, the only thing stopping me was that League had Dominion and Twisted Treeline (I didn&#039;t know about the existence of custom gamemodes on Dota back when I started LoL, hell LoL was my first game ever that wasn&#039;t an FPS). This move can only be detrimental for your business, market and for the gaming community. Unless you guys are replacing Dominion with something excellent you guys have thought of already, I don&#039;t know who the hell made the decision to throw it away.\r\n\r\nI think at this stage we can only hope that perhaps they have developed the game mode with magma Chamber. If they release that only then will the community be satisfied...even so Dominion will be missed by basically everyone. Why is Riot doing this? I honestly see no &quot;benefit&quot; of removing such a gamemode...","replies":[]}
