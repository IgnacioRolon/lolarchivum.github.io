His cool downs are meant to be that long, as when he was released, his w cd was low enough to make him essentially unkillable, so riot had to nerf it pretty hard. The 30 extra heal cap is absolutely insane now as lane hecarim can regain health at a %%%%%%edly fast speed, and if ever his q didn't do reduced damage to minions and monsters, he would be easily the fastest clearing champion in the whole game.\nAlso for your question about top hecarim, the buffs recently given has now rendered him an extremely powerful top laner, and so far I have had a 100% lane win rate in 5 games, two of which was against riven. His passive is not for only homeguard, but also allows thing such as youmuu's and righteous glory to be great picks on him, while movement speed items (pd, shiv, tri force etc) also give him a slight extra damage boost, and when paired with champions like zilean he is absolutely devastating.","replies":[]},{"poster":"SkarSkarSkarner","date":"2015-02-12T09:41:09.834+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"With the Skarner question, Flash is always better.
