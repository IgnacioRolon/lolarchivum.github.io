He turned around and gestured to the beautiful barmaid, dressed in an alluring French Maid outfit. He glanced at the Rabble Rouser, asking, &ldquo;you want anything more?&rdquo;\nFinishing his third mug of ale, he opened his mouth and laughed, &ldquo;well, if you&rsquo;re buying, I&rsquo;m in!&rdquo; \nYasuo was curious of what the Avarosan Ale tasted like. Little did they know, he had never tasted alcohol in his life. Being the responsible drinker as he is, what others thought as sake, was just milk.\nGragas leaned forward, asking &ldquo;So that&rsquo;s what leads you here then? Always on the run? That sounds nearly as fun as it is dangerous isn&rsquo;t it? With a guy like me, gee I can&rsquo;t exactly run a mile without having a break,&rdquo; patting his large belly.\n&ldquo;A sword&rsquo;s poor company for a long road, but I&rsquo;ve gotten used to it. I guess the longer you venture from society, the more it&rsquo;s worth returning.&rdquo; He unslung his sword sheath from his hip, and laid it on the table. &ldquo;I know a lot of people want me dead. They call it justice. I&rsquo;m the only one who knows the truth.&rdquo; Yasuo&rsquo;s eyes fell as he stroked the sheath, his voice deadpanned. &ldquo;All I have left is the wind by my side.&rdquo;\n\nHe could still feel the hot crimson liquid, seep through his fingers as his brother lay dying in his arms. He could still remember the look on Yone&rsquo;s face as his last words escaped his quivering mouth. He could still remember the feeling of being drenched in sorrow. But that was the past, and it ultimately became who he was. As his memories flooded his mind, he could only feel pity among himself.\n\nA soothing voice of a young woman broke his thoughts. &ldquo;Two large Avarosan Ales?&rdquo; said Nidalee with a hint of seduction in her voice.\n&ldquo;Aight, drink up buddy. You have a past that deserves to be forgotten. I don&rsquo;t even know if I have a past at this stage since I&rsquo;ve been drinking so much.&rdquo;\nThe two of them burst out laughing, Gragas leaning back as his belly pushed against the table, Yasuo shaking his head chuckling.\n\nThe double hinged door of the bar was suddenly booted open. Five, no six Ionian guards rushed in, blocking the doorway as Gragas and Yasuo&rsquo;s banter was cut off. Through the middle of the guards emerged a heavily armored Ionian general. Panic arose as everyone in the bar evacuated. Only the two captives along with the Ionian guards were left. &ldquo;Ha! There you are. Nowhere to run now.&rdquo; The general walked slowly towards the two, shouting at them. &ldquo;In the name of Ionia I charge you with murder of a-&rdquo;\nBefore he could finish, Yasuo outstretched his hand at him as a gesture of dismissal as he turned his head away. &ldquo;Yeah yeah we&rsquo;ve heard it before. Just tell me how the hell you found me.&rdquo;\nThe Ionian general fumed. &ldquo;I ain&rsquo;t telling you nothing, guards! Seize-&rdquo;\nA figure bearing a sword pushed the general aside from behind.\n&ldquo;It was me.&rdquo;\nThe figure was plated in sleek armor, a perfect combination of silver and green. His helmet had seven lenses stretching out from the front.\n&ldquo;My Seven Lenses of Insight can track a wider spectrum of light, but can also help track people from far away. I&rsquo;m sorry Yasuo. Your path ends here.&rdquo; His crisp Ionian accent rang through Yasuo&rsquo;s mind. But that didn&rsquo;t bother him. He didn&rsquo;t intend on being caught. Not today. He turned toward Gragas, giving him a look of assistance. Gragas immediately replied by returning a look of understanding. What ensued, was chaos. And everything happened at once.\n\nThe six guards, the general and Master Yi lunged forwards as Yasuo reached forth and gripped the two large glass mugs of ale. Gragas reached down behind the table and singlehandedly heaved up an entire keg of beer, stepping to the side for maximum power. Then time resumed.\n\nYasuo hurled the two mugs forward, catching the first two guards on the head. The glass was thick and hard, instantly knocking the two out. Gragas charged through the two now unconscious guards, swinging the keg violently around his body sending two more guards flying to either side of the bar. With a smooth underhand throw, he lost the keg along with the fifth guard, flying towards the sixth. But Yasuo was busy himself.\n\nYi swung with force and speed, but Yasuo was able to block every attack. However Yi was a master, and used the momentum of Yasuo&rsquo;s blocks as power for each subsequent attack. He swung his blade underhand at Yasuo legs from his right. Instantly reacting by jumping up to dodge the blade, Yi, using his momentum, twisted his body around and delivered a hard kick with his left foot. The kick landed true and Yasuo was sent flying backwards into the bar counter. Yasuo&rsquo;s head spun, stars filled his vision as he grunted in pain. Yi rested his blade on his shoulder and walked towards Yasuo.\n&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t have to do this Yasuo. Come quietly. I will try help you get through the court of Ionia.&rdquo;\nYasuo rose to his feet, raised his sword at Yi and panted in exhaustion. &ldquo;I can do this all day.&rdquo;\n\nA sudden thud sent Yi soaring through the air as Gragas dropped the dented wine keg. &ldquo;Right, looks like they&rsquo;re really stirring up a fight, you&rsquo;re gonna have to make a run for it.&rdquo; Gragas&rsquo; deep comforting voice helped Yasuo focus as he shook away the stars that filled his vision. The limping general yelled &ldquo;GUARD THE DOOR!&rdquo; Though battered and bruised, the determined general and 3 other guards stood in perfect formation, lances outstretched, blocking the doorway.\n&ldquo;What now?&rdquo;\nGragas sneered. &ldquo;Watch me,&rdquo; as he reached for his biggest cask.\n\nAll four of them were blown out the door of the bar, drenched in beer and wine. Gragas and Yasuo rushed out of the bar, knocking aside the double hinged doors.\n&ldquo;What the hell was that?&rdquo; Yasuo exclaimed.\n&ldquo;My Explosive Cask, keep it near me when things get too messy. Not that it helps but ah it spices things up. It&rsquo;s spiced wine, gets that extra kick into it.&rdquo;\n&ldquo;Yeah that was one helluva kickback.&rdquo;\nGragas patted Yasuo on the back. &ldquo;Right, I think you should take your leave. I&rsquo;ll be able to deal with these guys, but Yi&rsquo;s escaped and he&rsquo;ll be on the hunt for you.&rdquo;\nYasuo nodded in acknowledgement. &ldquo;Couldn&rsquo;t have done it without you. I owe you one.&rdquo;\nGragas laughed it off. &ldquo;Haha, just remember, if you&rsquo;re buying, I&rsquo;m in.&rdquo;\n\nYasuo set off through the woods, the winds carrying him faster than he had ran before. But he couldn&rsquo;t look back, he could sense an unwanted presence. He emerged from the forest into a small open plain near a pond, where with a flash of light, he was stopped abruptly in his path. Had he not brought his sword up in time, he&rsquo;d be in two. Yi&rsquo;s heavy blow knocked him backwards as Yasuo tumbled backwards onto the grass. \n&ldquo;You cannot outrun me.&rdquo; Yi said, deadpanned with his crisp Ionian accent. His body had a golden glow radiating from his armor. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t force this upon yourself brother.&rdquo;\n&ldquo;You&rsquo;re not my brother. Last time this happened my brother ended up in a pool of blood.&rdquo; Yasuo replied angrily with a hint of pain in his voice. &ldquo;Besides, the Ionian law is what&rsquo;s forcing this upon me.&rdquo;\n&ldquo;You must pay for your actions. That is how justice works.&rdquo; Yi said as he sheathed his sword on his back. \n&ldquo;This is not justice. I&rsquo;ve told you countless times, that murder was not committed by me. I&rsquo;ve told them before; I am wandering the lands to find who did this to me. Who did this to us.&rdquo;\n&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry brother. Ionia has put a price and a time on your head.&rdquo;\nGripping his sword, Yi rushed his blade towards Yasuo. Too late to block the blow, the sword edge made contact with his neck, only to have a bright light radiate from his supposed wound. Within seconds, Yasuo magically disappeared, only to be summoned to the Fields of Justice.\nUnable to overcome the magic of the powerful summoners of League of Legends, Yi sighed and spoke under his breath. &ldquo;You live to fight another day.&rdquo;\n___________\n\nBack at the bar, a limping and intoxicated general stumbled towards Gragas. &ldquo;By the name of Ionia, you are arrested for helping a-&rdquo;\nGragas grabbed the generals head and dunked it into a puddle of wine. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll drink you under the table scrub. This is Freljord.&rdquo;\n\n{{champion:157}} {{champion:79}} {{champion:11}}","replies":[{"poster":"Oneechan","date":"2016-07-10T11:26:23.007+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Great use of the champion's skill sets and quotes.

I somewhat have a whole plot figured out, where the hate, pain and regret of Yasuo has made him an emotionally guarded person but so has Riven after being abandoned and left to die to Singed's poison. Then they would have a love hate relationship (they're listed as rivals and not \"enemies\") where both are both on the verge of killing each other, forgiving each other and understanding each other. \nI would've made it so Yasuo's initial exposure to Riven was in the game he was about to have where as Yasuo was sent top, the mid laner Taliyah and he would exchange some 'philosophical' words, especially tied to how people should forgive and forget, especially despite the fact that they can take their anger out however they want on the Fields of Justice since they just keep respawning, since life and death in the Fields of Justice is only temporary, as a result Yasuo can reflect upon how his grudges can only be temporary, since there's nothing in life you can't get over.\n\nSpoiler Alert: everybody gets killed by the satanic overlord Teemo lmao I've said too much of the plot already but eh, that's what I'm thinking of doing if people want me to continue :P","replies":[{"poster":"Ripcord24","date":"2016-06-26T10:58:53.854+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"So much plot...\nBut yeah, if you have any spare time to continue this that'd be awesome, I know I'll be reading it{{sticker:slayer-pantheon-thumbs}}","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Chalze","date":"2016-06-26T07:33:06.066+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey guys!

I hope the ending wasn't too confusing, basically Yasuo was able to escape as he was summoned for a game. As a result he was just teleported out to the Fields of Justice.\n\nSo yeah, thanks for reading! Responses are welcome :) :) :)","replies":[]}]}
