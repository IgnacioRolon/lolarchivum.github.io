I'm on fibre, dunno if that makes a difference with the international lines going to Aussie though. Are you on copper or Fibre?\n\n(Probably should make a new thread for this)\nThe new international net line in NZ (Subject to our Govt approval) will hopefully will go through Hawaii to USA soon, once our Govt gets enough grief from the public (Promulgate this round and make other kiwis aware of whats required for faster net) and who knows our ping could be better from NA over OCE lol. Na just kidding it will never be, but downloading and streaming would be  a lot better. As currently we have to go though Aussie lines to get hooked up to the rest of the world (sigh).","replies":[]}]}
