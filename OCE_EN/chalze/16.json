Knowing I was one of the first people on the Oceanic server is really cool. I only have one question though I was going to send to Riot Support but I might as well ask you now.\nSo apparently when you transfer to a new server you can choose a new summoner name (I don't remember what it was when I came over to Oceanic Server 3 years ago). I want to change it back to 'airaze' which I started off with back in late S2 and I was thinking whether that name will be available when I get back there. For example right now I can search up 'airaze' on LoLKing and it'll show up my old account back on NA server; will that name be available for me to change to? Considering it's already 3 years old and inactive.\n\nThanks Maraudaur!\n\n{{champion:91}} {{champion:91}} {{champion:91}} {{champion:91}} {{champion:91}} {{champion:91}}","replies":[{"poster":"Maraudaur","date":"2016-11-28T10:27:43.640+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"Sorry man I'm not sure, player support is still the best place for that.","replies":[{"poster":"Chalze","date":"2016-11-28T19:57:52.445+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Aight no worries, I'll send them a ticket.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Talon12","date":"2016-11-28T22:33:09.570+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Evirtua,realm=OCE,application-id=Ntey9fRZ,discussion-id=Y3xsXmEs,comment-id=00000000,timestamp=2016-11-28T08:04:49.081+0000)\nwhether that name will be available\n>\n\n\nDid a quick check for you, that name should now be available to use from the 28/6/15, which was well over a year ago, so you're all good on that front. Although, I'm not sure if you will be given the name change option, as (if i remember correctly) its only given to you if your name is already taken, which did a scan again) it is not, so you might have to invest a little extra to get that name change, although do save that RP buy (if you do) until you're in America, because as was previously stated rito games loves NA and as such they get a much better price (yes their currency is worth more, (but even so we earn our currency at the same rate, cash hogs) cashing in at 24% more than we get.\n\nIf you didn't bother reading that TDLR: **Both your names are available on NA**\n\nAlso, Trump is a criminal, don't like him by any means, he got elected mainly through empty lies.\n----\n\nAlso, don't forget your inflatable Kangaroo, Americans are fascinated by those. Not even kidding seen it before some random Aussie thought it would be funny to hop around on a blow up roo in America, all the residents came out and even some of the kids said thing along the lines of \"Look ma, they do ride kangaroo's\" Funny people, even if they are a bit wacky on their decision making (Trump.
