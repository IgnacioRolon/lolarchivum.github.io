What if there was a Lee skin based on Lui Kang (not the story mode zombie one, the multiplayer one)? Lui Kang has an iconic &#039;ability&#039; to have &#039;Fire/Flame Fists&#039; which could be Lee&#039;s passive, and one of Lui Kang&#039;s scissors-split fatality kick (with fire animations on his feet) could be Lee&#039;s &#039;Resonating Strike&#039;...\r\n\r\nWhat do you guys say? (Yes yes I know about Shen-corpion and Sub-Shen-ro but c&#039;mon, those are old with no special animations)","replies":[{"poster":"oops","date":"2015-04-21T06:20:13.448+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Surely there would be no legal issues, I don't see why Riot shouldn't just rip skins straight from MKX.","replies":[{"poster":"Unseen Predator","date":"2015-04-21T06:35:53.755+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Dat sarcasm, or are you just stupid?
