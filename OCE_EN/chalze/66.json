B, The ip boost was for a very special occasion, this post is extremely %%%%y.\n\nThis time it was particularly bad, it wasn't just lag, but also the client bugging up and full on crashes and disconnections. But luckily it was dealt with quite quickly so an extra day of IP boost request/compensation is fine now, thought I would've fought harder if the issues had kept continuing.\nIP Boosts are a rare/special occasion, but for us to have 'shorter' time than promised due to Riot's problems does make it sensible for Riot to compensate for it.\n\nBut since the issues went away reasonably quickly, everything is settled.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Cucked by      S","date":"2016-09-18T08:38:03.635+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I dodged 4 queue pops on my smurf DESPITE accepting the ready check.
