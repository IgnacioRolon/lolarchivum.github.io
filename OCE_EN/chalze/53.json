I'm sorry I sounded that way, I just think it's hilarious how much of a nuisance he can become if he knows how to play the map and when to engage. He doesn't require mechanics and I think it's funny when he just goes ham and you're silenced and you just have to take his spinning and just be like 'well I didn't want to use my combo anyways'. \n\n That said a champion I used to play alot and still do sometimes; cho'gath is in my opinion the pinnacle of not being good and still being able to destroy people who master highskillcap champions. Mastery 7 Yasou? hahahahahaha I picked cho'gath you aren't going to have a good time. He's deadlevel easy, with huge sustain, naturally super tanky, massive sustained melee damage, ranged poke, a knockup and silence, huge true damage, high ap ratios but also high base damage. I have mastery 5 almost 6 in cho'gath and imo there is no difference between playing him first time and mastering him, you'll still do well.","replies":[{"poster":"Nightjar","date":"2016-08-11T10:56:58.267+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Also good waveclear and even if you are completely outmatched in lane nobody wants to towerdive you.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Nightjar","date":"2016-08-11T08:39:47.043+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I have no problem with riven mains so long as they look at their map, maybe roam and ping mias, since they often are strong enough to end the game before the teamfight heavy lategame if they get ahead; and I feel riven mains aren't as toxic as they might have been in the past.","replies":[{"poster":"Nightjar","date":"2016-08-11T08:41:49.917+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I generally don't have any problem with any main though so long as you aren't super toxic...except for lvl7 teemo's who lose lane to nasus even though I camped top and who try to convince me that teemo is countered by nasus even though I played teemo for a fairly long time and I don't see how you can lose that lane.","replies":[{"poster":"Xuízunä","date":"2016-08-11T10:21:08.637+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I agree!
