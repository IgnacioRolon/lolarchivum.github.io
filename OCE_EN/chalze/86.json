I am in no way boasting but I have gotten S&#039;s on champions like Kalista, Orianna and Malphite, all who if played correctly can easily give you an easy S on ARAM. The thing is, is that it is random, but if you&#039;re struggling to gain an S grade on a lot of champions you&#039;re using, might as well go take ARAM a swing.\n\nI sometimes still do this mainly due to the fact that most of the champions I&#039;m actually any good at I already have Hextech chests so if you still have a bunch of random champions you hardly use and have little to no motivation to try get an S with them on Summoner&#039;s Rift, playing ARAM can be a fun experience as well as a way to get chests if lucky. After all, ARAMs do last shorter than an average 45min game so I guess you 'play more full games' of ARAM than Summoner's Rift.\n\nSo ultimately, unfortunately it is still due to luck as opposed to Summoner&#039;s Rift being skill, but I still think it&#039;s a fun way to get chests. But the biggest downside is, is the fact that you&#039;ll still need to earn those keys.\n\nSo I guess, play away guys!\n\n{{sticker:slayer-jinx-wink}}","replies":[{"poster":"jontebenno","date":"2016-11-24T22:28:38.002+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Getting S scores and chests are really easy, I find that getting key fragments is much harder due to the random drop, when I play regularly I stack up chests and have no keys, right now I have 9 chests and no keys/fragments.  which will take ages to unlock as I would have to win my next 27 games, as champions that I own, and get a key fragment every single time, which is as far as I know about the key drop rates, impossible or nearly impossible, and I would probably get more chests during those games.  If you want more hextech loot, play with larger groups, as riot stated that keys drop more with more people and when in a premade, if any one of the people in the premade earns an S you are eligible for a chest( I think you need to be playing a champ you own and haven't had a chest on yet), which obviously massively increases your chances of getting a chest if you have 3-5 players in the premade. I'm not a statistician but queuing up in large premades seems to me to be the best way of getting loot.","replies":[{"poster":"Chalze","date":"2016-11-24T23:43:16.052+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"In other words, if you're really good of course you can use skill but someone like me I hardly venture out of my champion pool so I'm 'done' for this season (e.g. I'll never get an S with someone like uhh Mordekaiser but who knows I might get one on ARAM somehow, so that's a chest that I would've never got since I don't play Morde)","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"DarkShade918","date":"2018-06-20T03:39:57.834+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"34 chests, only played norms/ranked\n\nMaybe you could just get good, and then you will earn chests faster\n\n(duoing also helps)","replies":[{"poster":"Roguestoney","date":"2018-06-20T03:48:36.126+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"Mate.

I have 97% of the champions but I only have chests on 20% of the champions cuz I hardly venture out of my current champion pool so this helps me get random chests every now and then.","replies":[]}]}]}
