I actually thought his current kit was really fun. \n\nIf he is then it's not an ultimate skin for him, because why would they release an ultimate skin for him now when he's getting reworked? Also I doubt it's a rework cause the Yorick rework only just happened.\n\nMost likely a new champion, it kinda fits the theme of champion teasers.","replies":[]}]}
