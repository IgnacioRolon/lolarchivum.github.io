Many of us enjoy what rito gives (for free), I still find the game very entertaining after having played since season 2.\n\n[edit] Got my S grade on Kog this morning, SKT1 Vayne skin shard tyvm.","replies":[{"poster":"Chalze","date":"2016-08-31T04:49:53.646+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=QAPLA,realm=OCE,application-id=Ntey9fRZ,discussion-id=6loRAIVv,comment-id=0001,timestamp=2016-08-31T00:44:37.111+0000)\n>\n> As I only ARAM, I often get idk, 30k+ ip sitting there doing nothing.
