The only thing was, was that at the end, I&#039;d be soloing the Nexus 3 times or so since the 4 of them just run into fountain and die so they can &#039;restart&#039; the fights which we will only just barely win due to me spamming W in teamfights as Sona. The last time I had to solo the Nexus, I did manage to kill it, even the Nexus explosion animation played, but it wasn&#039;t in time for the 4 man premade surrender and despite the enemy Nexus explosion animation already played and gone, our Nexus still played its animation, exploded and we got a Defeat.\r\n\r\nI really don&#039;t understand the mentalities of these Chinese premades being so over-confident and doing such a thing. They all had ranked borders above Silver whereas I was unranked, I told them how I thought they were good due to their borders, and that as the only unranked player on the team, I should be the &#039;bottom line&#039; and nobody should be worse than me, and they begin to (using very broken English and a fine mixture of Chinese &#039;pinyin&#039;) mock me by saying how I&#039;m Silver/Gold+ and how they&#039;re gonna report me for &#039;trying to push&#039; for the win.\r\n\r\nI honestly will never understand these Chinese people...one more reason to hate being mistakened for one...","replies":[{"poster":"normanzzz","date":"2016-11-05T13:25:10.684+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"finally someone said CERTAIN chinese people. i see people be like : fuck you u asians go kys and im like wtf. why do you think every asian guy is toxic/bad just becoz one asian was bad or couldnt understand you. jesus","replies":[{"poster":"Chalze","date":"2016-11-06T01:18:53.957+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=pocky sama,realm=OCE,application-id=Ntey9fRZ,discussion-id=KU4uXHEH,comment-id=0001,timestamp=2016-11-05T13:25:10.684+0000)\n>\n> finally someone said CERTAIN chinese people. i see people be like : fuck you u asians go kys and im like wtf. why do you think every asian guy is toxic/bad just becoz one asian was bad or couldnt understand you. jesus\n\nI'm 100% certain they are chinese, I meant that this certain group was being weird.\nSo I'm not assuming they're chinese because they're toxic/bad, it's because not only was their english broken, they also used pinyin and later friended me and their statuses has simplified chinese characters.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Fitzky","date":"2016-11-03T08:58:17.712+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I've been encountering a big number of Chinese players recently in games as well\nhmmmmm","replies":[]}]}
