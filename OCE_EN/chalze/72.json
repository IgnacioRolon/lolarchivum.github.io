I do have Ice Drake but not only did this ruin the fiery theme but even the visuals of Sunfire Cape become more boring (I agree how the old one looked like a debuff, but it made you look so much cooler, especially when I always rushed Sunfire on Warlord Shen because it looks so beast).\r\n\r\nI want to go back in the days where Sunfire looked like you were on fire, when Shyvana had her old classic and when Elixir of Fortitude existed :’(\r\n\r\n\r\nAnyone share this nostalgia with me?
