Kassadin has the largest mana pool of any champion in LoL (I think) at most stages of the game, and I think his total mana with Archangels is 2538. Archangels gives 60 AP and 3% AP from max mana, which for Kassadin is 76.14. That means Archangels gives you 136.14 AP at Lvl 18. Das insane compared to other mages with Archangels.\n\nSo yeah, always get an Archangels stacking, and once you get snowballing, you can singlehandedly carry anything really (except a whole team of tanks, fk dat sht)","replies":[]},{"poster":"Chalze","date":"2014-12-14T20:07:00.354+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Back in the days where people think Irelia was meh because she had a 'history' of nerfs but she was still strong and now it's being proven by her ban rate but I sense Kassadin is like this now, and more people will realise he's still somewhat strong if he gets going.\n\nGuys, lemme put this out now. Play Kassadin (in low elo) and abuse his snowballing potential before he really turns back as over strong in the meta. Kassadin is said to be weak due to his history of nerfs and the fact that his early game horrible, but even though he has a history of being nerfed, he can still snowball like hell (trust me, back then, my post-nerf Kassadin win rate was 11-1. I played 12 games in total basically and lost one [AFK lel]) and his weak early game can be avoided since low elo people don't punish you enough (like Akali, no one seems to punish her enough these days).\n\nSo GO NOW, AND PLAY KASSAWIN PEOPLES","replies":[]}]}
