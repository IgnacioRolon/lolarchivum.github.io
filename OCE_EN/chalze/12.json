Also, I know some team mates are good and try to tell you what to do but eventually you will learn by yourself and chances of you playing with the same people is less than 50%.

I will offer advice, such as \"hey, the whole enemy team is AD and you are feeding, try building some armour\". etc.\nWhen you see players that don't engage in teamfights, only wait to clean up after (maybe it's acceptable with champs like Yi, but not Gangplank, who was the subject of discussion) in ARAM, have very low assists, but still more deaths than kills, yeah... this dude deserves a comment or two. Not spiteful comments, just a \"how about teamplay rather than personal gain play?\".\n\nI say this because I prize myself on being a team player. Like, earlier today I had a game (ARAM), where I was Singed, on a team with 4 ADC's.\nOur Kog'maw chose to go AD rather than AP despite the team selection, and ranted and raved at me \"feeding\". Calling me \"retard\" and such. I built tank, we lost the game, and low and behold, in postgame stats, who had the most damage dealt to champs (out of both teams) ? Tank Singed did. The last time I played Singed before this game, I got an S grade.\n\nWho is the fool that doesn't know how to play? The tank that out-damages all the ADC's, or the Kog that thinks K/D/A means everything? (and I of course had most assists).","replies":[{"poster":"WeaponizedAutizm","date":"2016-09-07T19:10:54.333+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"\"GP 4 assists, real team player\" and \"how about teamplay rather than personal gain play?\" are poles apart in sentiment and intent.

Yes.\nLonger answer? Yes, if they are the type to have little emotional control and flare up easily over direct or, in this case, indirect slights cast at them or are simply is a 'bad place' in that moment.\n\n> You are so funny.\n\nI like to think I have my moments...\n{{sticker:slayer-jinx-wink}}","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Arcsecond","date":"2016-09-12T20:26:46.412+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Unfortunately some people are quite easily tilted no matter how benign your intentions were.
