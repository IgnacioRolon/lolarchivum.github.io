Nami is the easiest out of the 3 I'd say. Bard is the hardest and Zyra hasn't been seen very much for a while, although she's great for peeling.","replies":[{"poster":"Antodara","date":"2015-04-14T02:07:43.253+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"I haven't seen a single bard player that can actually support well. His laning phase sucks as he doesn't have any real lockdown or peel for you to get in to trade with, and that ult is more of a hinderance than a blessing until it gets to teamfight stage. Nami is a better support overall, the ult and the Q allow for some serious plays, especially for close range ADC's like Graves or Vayne.","replies":[{"poster":"Lord Kylar Alice","date":"2015-04-14T06:05:46.687+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Antodara,realm=NA,application-id=Ntey9fRZ,discussion-id=phxqE10X,comment-id=000000000000,timestamp=2015-04-14T02:07:43.253+0000)\n>\n> I haven't seen a single bard player that can actually support well.

I meant peel not as the way it's meant. I guess that's where you got confused a bit.\n\nBard can't stop an enemy champ for you to harass and/or kill. Nami can. Bard's ultimate can actually leave YOU as the ADC in a really bard spot. Nami's wont. Bard has a heal, so does nami, bard's is slightly better. Bard is intended as a harass and peel/pick support, but doesn't do these jobs well as his harass damage is pitiful and his pick is so situational or it's linked to a long cooldown attached to his ultimate it just isn't funny. \n\nNami is incredibly solid, and I have never performed badly when laned with nami. When laned against bard as the support, nine times out of ten, I get giddy as it's basically a free kill lane unless the bard is spectacular. And if he's really good, it just means there's a player like him not behin the keyboard of, say, a Lee Sin or a Riven.","replies":[{"poster":"Chalze","date":"2015-04-14T10:09:42.853+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Antodara,realm=NA,application-id=Ntey9fRZ,discussion-id=phxqE10X,comment-id=00000000000000000000,timestamp=2015-04-14T06:44:52.081+0000)\n>Bard's ultimate can actually leave YOU as the ADC in a really **bard** spot. \n> \ni c wa chu di dere","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"BarryButcher","date":"2015-04-14T02:56:10.746+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Bard is fun just fro messing around. He's no good for Solo Que imo, but he just super fun to play with friends.\n\nZyra is good if you know how to play her. A good Zyra can solo carry a bot lane with her zone control and damage. A bad Zyra will be 0-6 by 4 minutes since shes super squishy.\n\nNami is just solid. Heals, CC, Disengage. Strong kit.","replies":[]}]}
