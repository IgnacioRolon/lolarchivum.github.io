Healers are ridiculously valuable on ARAM, especially in the early game. They tend to fall off if there are no tanks on their team, and/or when the other team has a \"balanced\" composition. With MF, she's good for some poke. Take Deathfire, grab a Rod of Ages as your first item and just spam E. That's what I always do and it usually ends with me having few deaths (so long as there's a good amount of coordination on my team).","replies":[{"poster":"I Stealth I","date":"2017-08-11T06:58:53.856+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"bruh, 3 year old thread\n\nThe fact that Evirtua isn't even in OCE anymore makes it worse\n\nXD","replies":[{"poster":"Project Xayah","date":"2017-08-11T07:15:58.261+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Ha!
