This one is typically overseen but it&rsquo;s quite low actually. You just have to be Lvl30. That&rsquo;s a problem.\r\n\r\n\r\n_______\r\n\r\nSo, to enter a competitive scene, you don&rsquo;t have to be good, you just have to level up by playing long enough, it doesn&rsquo;t matter if you lost 300 games to reach Lvl30 and not a single win, you can still play ranked but damn will your teammates hate you for feeding. The second problem with the &lsquo;ranked requirements&rsquo; is that it&rsquo;s not &lsquo;skill based&rsquo;. You can reach Lvl30 by buying with money, XP boosts and this is why you see some people in Bronze V with only 50 or so normal wins. God knows how many losses that mofo has.\r\n\r\nSo, my main problem with people who generally suck in low elo dragging other better players down purely because they suck so much.\r\nLegit, I don&rsquo;t play ranked often at all, but I KNOW that there are people who actually drag your team down not because they&rsquo;re trolling or whatnot, it&rsquo;s actually because they generally aren&rsquo;t skilled enough.\r\n\r\nWhat kinds of people drag &ldquo;normal&rdquo; skilled people down to low elo? Anything that can lose a game, and that&rsquo;s generally trolls, AFKers and players who generally suck. So how do we fix this?\r\n\r\nWell I propose a different cap on being able to play ranked. I say that instead of making it Lvl30; instead of making it based on level which can be bought, I say we make it based on how many successful games a player has which isn&rsquo;t purchasable and purely on skill, for example, 200 normal wins at least.\r\n\r\n___________\r\n\r\nSo there are three scenarios for the 3 different people (well, 4 including the normal player).\r\n\r\n1 - Those who generally suck.\r\nWelp, you start playing and unfortunately you&rsquo;re just not that good at the game. But that&rsquo;s fine, because (I think) theres no way for others to see how many losses you have, so that&rsquo;s not a problem (other than the ending screen of a game which then just cover it up or something) but if your win loss ratio is only lets say, 1:2 (you win 1 game per 2 losses), you can play lets say 200 or so games to reach Lvl30, but you&rsquo;re not that good because you only have 1/3 of them as wins, which isn&rsquo;t enough. So that prevents this guy who actually sucks from playing ranked. The only way he can play ranked is that he has to experience how to be good enough to WIN 200 games which may be 600 games but that&rsquo;s fine, because he has 200 normal wins, he knows how to win and play normally, therefore he can enter ranked queues fine.\r\n\r\n2 - Trolls\r\nWhy would you&hellip;I mean you still need to win 200 games at least so you can enter ranked to troll. So again, you still know how to play seriously for a few hundred games so you can enter ranked. You have played 200 wins. You know how to win. You wanna troll in ranked then that&rsquo;s your decision. Teammate reports will cover that problem.\r\n\r\n3 - AFKs\r\nLeaverBuster\r\n\r\n4 - Normal Player\r\nNo problem, 200 normal wins should be fine if you have a 50% win rate or so. It&rsquo;s not too hard, we reach around 130~150 normal wins at Lvl30 anyway. Not gonna be a problem.\r\n\r\nJust to add the 5th type - Smurfs\r\nWell, you should be good enough to win yourself 200 games easily.\r\n\r\n_____\r\n\r\nSo this new &lsquo;requirement&rsquo; for ranked solves the biggest problem, people who generally suck and buy XP boosts thinking they&rsquo;re good enough for ranked.\r\nThis new requirement actually requires some degree of skill from the player before they enter ranked. I think this is tons better than just &lsquo;Lvl30 you can play ranked&rsquo;.\r\n\r\nPeople don&rsquo;t realise, when you reach Lvl30, you&rsquo;re not ready for the competitive scene, it just means that you know this game. You&rsquo;re not necessarily good or bad, you just know it.\r\n\r\nTo git gud is another story, and that story should take you to around the 200 normal wins cap to enter the competitive scene.\r\n\r\n__________\r\n\r\nOr Riot can just make levelling up harder but hey that&rsquo;s just discouraging for smurfs and new players alike&hellip;\r\n\r\n___________________\r\n \r\n \r\n \r\nSo what do you guys reckon?","replies":[{"poster":"She Loves Me","date":"2015-04-10T22:22:26.364+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You're saying teams are keeping better players in bronze.

If you cant carry you belong there.\n\n\nNot ‘teams’, but a single player can ruin it for the rest 4.\nBoosters usually have significantly more skill to easily carry themselves out of Bronze. Boosters are usually Gold/Plat+ which of course have a breeze through Bronze, but I’m not talking about those.\n\nSee, there aren’t just good players and bad players, there are also normal players. Good players will be positive, whereas bad players will be negative, but normal players will stay neutral/slightly positive, more likely to be pulled down by bad players because well, lets face it, there are FAR more bad players than good in Bronze. \n\nGood Players: Doesn’t matter what my team does, I can carry them through any sht that happens.\n\nBad Players: I don’t have the skill to not feed so I will drag my teammates down.\n\nNormal Players: I won’t feed and I should do ‘well’ if my teammates don’t feed. They don’t have to carry, just not feed.\n\nEither way, this isn’t about boosters and whatnot, it’s about how the new ranked requirement should allow normal to good players in ranked, and keep bad players out forever OR until they become normal (or possibly good). That’s the point of this thread.","replies":[{"poster":"She Loves Me","date":"2015-04-11T00:26:14.728+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"if everyone was somewhat good in ranked we wouldnt have a bronze tier.... are you dense or what?
