Champions who have really long ranged blinks has the whole entire map around them just flashing in their face, and it's hard to 're-aim' stuff if you have your camera locked.\r\nI know, just turn off camera lock for when you flash/blink (like Liss and Kass) but like, for those who don't like to unlock camera, why not have a smooth (but still quick enough) shift to where you are after the blink?\r\n\r\nClarity buff :P\r\nI'm not sure if anyone actually understands what I mean :\\","replies":[{"poster":"Klavinmour","date":"2014-12-22T03:20:59.984+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I don't understand people who lock their camera...\n\nHow do you play long range champs?
