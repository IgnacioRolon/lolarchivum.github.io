If the dagger hits an enemy unit, it will suppresses them for 0.5 seconds. X champion can cast this ability a 2nd time within the 0.5 suppress (stuns scale with tenacity so it&rsquo;s harder for X champion against someone like Irelia with 9346% tenacity)\r\nSecond Cast - X champion pulls back his target a set distance towards him however will not exceed behind melee range (no over pulls). The chain will stay attached for another 0.5 seconds. If the target isn&rsquo;t in melee range, X champions can cast this ability a 3rd time within 0.5 seconds of the attached chain.\r\nThird Cast - X champion dashes to his target, dealing damage again.\r\n\r\nIf on the Second Cast, the target is put within melee range, X champion&rsquo;s next auto attack will be buffed with the same damage as the Third Cast, slowing his target.\r\n\r\nSo it&rsquo;s like in-between a Thresh Q and a Lee Q, but with more &lsquo;flexibility&rsquo;. Might be OP, but I think it&rsquo;s pretty cool.","replies":[{"poster":"CakeyZ","date":"2015-04-11T02:55:50.072+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"i see this working very much as thresh's Q, but instead of it being a choice if you dash or not, you're screwed to have to dash. That way its about landing on the right person. Perhaps just make it that you can activate the ability again while its travelling to recall the chain, in case you can tell you're gonna miss?","replies":[]}]}
