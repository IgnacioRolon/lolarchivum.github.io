Will Q deal damage 3 times to a single target?\r\n\r\n{{champion:245}} {{champion:245}} {{champion:245}} {{champion:245}} {{champion:245}} {{champion:245}} {{champion:245}}","replies":[{"poster":"Auir","date":"2015-06-01T13:46:20.806+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"It doesn't work, I've been trying for a flat 9 hours yesterday and the Q only procs twice. \n\nMy theory is that because when you use your ultimate it is not a teleport like shen's ultimate or katarina E. Rather you are traveling backwards in time and thus when you jump back through your Q path the Q simply disappears as you pass it rendering the entire idea useless. But that is just my theory.","replies":[{"poster":"kJs","date":"2015-06-01T14:58:12.359+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"Logic doesn't apply because Corkie and Anivia still gets snared by Caitlyn's traps.","replies":[{"poster":"Auir","date":"2015-06-02T10:09:05.239+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Ahaha those aren't skills, rather they are still in the terms of league \"walking\"","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Focus On End","date":"2015-06-01T06:20:32.458+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"so you're going to blow your ult on the sole purpose of making your Q hit an extra time, lel.","replies":[{"poster":"ShuffledPancake","date":"2015-06-01T06:40:41.263+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=tempname7371343,realm=OCE,application-id=Ntey9fRZ,discussion-id=dl7t1EA8,comment-id=0004,timestamp=2015-06-01T06:20:32.458+0000)\n>\n> so you're going to blow your ult on the sole purpose of making your Q hit an extra time, lel.\n\nits not blowing your ult.... you are hitting them with the ult and 3 times with q.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Bipolar","date":"2015-06-01T00:48:45.098+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"It can only hit twice.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Icoryx","date":"2016-09-10T17:50:21.666+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"DOESN'T WORK :/ TESTED\nI think what @Auir said is true but I got a theory. You run in a straight line and when you want to do the combo you run to the side and when your Ult is almost straight again you throw your Q back wards wait for it to come back and then you use ult and {{summoner:4}}! behind the enemy. That should work cause you ult away from your Q instead of Ulting into the Q's direction.","replies":[{"poster":"Chalze","date":"2016-09-11T04:22:19.900+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"This was well over a year ago lol","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"sparklefart","date":"2015-06-01T00:34:50.487+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"no","replies":[]},{"poster":"JasonWazza","date":"2015-06-01T04:23:20.307+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":">Iâ€™ve also seen Varus Qs damaging twice if the flash into it again after they got hit (extremely rare).\n\nPretty sure this doesn't happen.","replies":[{"poster":"kJs","date":"2015-06-01T07:48:54.378+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":3,"body":"I've seen Ezreal's Q deal twice if the target flashes accordingly.","replies":[{"poster":"Auir","date":"2015-06-02T10:09:29.505+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"How does Ez.
