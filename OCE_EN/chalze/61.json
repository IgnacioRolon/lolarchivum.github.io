I'm only one example, but it's easy to understand how a lot of others would feel as well.","replies":[{"poster":"Chalze","date":"2014-11-26T07:34:03.194+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I still check here daily now, but I'm forced to do so...I'd much prefer our beloved GD...\n\n{{item:3031}} {{champion:157}} {{item:3087}}","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"combat","date":"2014-11-26T04:00:36.564+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"What?
