At the time I had absolutely no interest in MOBAs like LoL/Dota2/whatever. I was happily playing my own games until a person I always looked up to had started to play LoL, my older brother (who has now quit due to academic/work reasons).\r\n\r\nHe would often play LoL in front of me and always wanted me to try it out, however I refused basically every time while I opened my FPS games and played on. Back then, LoL looked childish. Like, seriously childish. I was comparing at the time LoL with Modern Warfare 2 and I was thinking to myself, “how the heck did my brother get into something that looked so childish?” I would deny his invitation every time.\r\n\r\nUntil, one Sunday, being the slightly selfless person that I am, I decided to install LoL purely for the sake of making my brother stop annoying me (I had a Mac back then and I remember I had used the boomjie iLoL Client). Back then, patching was long and painful, but I decided that since at the time I had no Administrator rights on my laptop yet, I had to think of an idea to stop my laptop from going to standby as it was on installing LoL.\r\nSo, what I did was, I plugged my laptop charger in, opened the client, started to install, and found a rubber and a few coins to weigh down a key for key repeat on a TextEdit file to avoid standby.\r\nBy the time I came back to my laptop after a day out with the family, the installation had completed (after 6 hours, yeah, the iLoL client was slow) and I had made an account. My parents went to take a nap, and that was when my brother and I joined the first game of LoL I’ve ever played.\r\n\r\nI had no idea what I was doing, and my brother told me to ignore the tutorial in The Proving Grounds (for those who were playing back then) so I just straight to a Co-Op 5v5. I was in champion select where my brother looked at the free champs, and decided that he would teach me how to play Pantheon, which became my first every champion that I ever played. For summoner spells, and I will always remember this quote from my brother, “You can’t take Flash right now, so get Ghost. Always have something to do with mobility as a summoner spell”. Then he told me to get Surge on Pantheon. lol\r\nI entered game, and I had no idea what to do, except to move. I would always forget to buy stuff, always stack BF swords, always owner why I couldn’t cast all my abilities at Lvl 1, and as Pantheon, I would always cancel my own channeling abilities.\r\n\r\nI eventually had enough IP to get a champion which I reckon was the coolest looking champion that I had known. I purchased him, and spammed him in every game I played. He was none other, than the Wuju Bladesman. I own a Mac and I could have several desktops at a time through Mission Control, and I basically made all my backgrounds Yi skins. Oh boy, the old Yi art is by far the most nostalgic image I have of LoL. My brother came up to ma and mockingly asked “You think Yi looks cool? You really thing Yi looks cool? What about this guy?” He showed me Malzahar, and Malzahar became my first 4800IP champion. I in fact wasted 2 refunds on Jax and Xin just to get enough IP to get Malzahar, and back then and even until now, I still think it was a good decision (getting Malzahar, but not wasting my 2 refunds >_> I eventually bought back both Jax and Xin but oh well, I wasn’t even Lvl10 yet).\r\n\r\nThis went on for some time. I keep finding newer, cooler champions/skins and I eventually got hooked on LoL, and I got hooked well. I eventually forgot about most of my other FPS games and I went sorely on LoL, playing whenever I had the opportunity; on all maps, Rift, Scar and Treeline. The most ‘changing’ thing my brother would show me would be Dragonblade Talon, a skin even until now do I love and treasure above many other skins I own (but grr godamnit they removed his silence >_>).\r\n\r\nOne of my friends at school decided to give me a few RP cards, and to my surprise, even though I asked for 1 $10 RP card, she gave me 2 $25 RP cards. I was almost overwhelmed by the total of approx 7000RP I had (she’s a great friend, although one I had to say no to when she told me that she liked me. In fact, only last month did she try LoL. She’s far from Lvl30 xDD)\r\nI instabought 2 things: Talon, and Dragonblade Talon. I didn’t know what else to get, so I also instabought 2 things I always wanted at the time: Wukong, and General Wukong. If I remember correctly, I hadn’t had that much hype for any champion/s other than Talon and Wukong at the time. I then had around 3 lots of “975” I could spend, and I decided, well, I got the RP for free, I might as well get champions with them. I proceeded to buy Lee Sin, Darius and another skin which I cannot remember anymore. I remember when Darius was at the top of his OP scene, and I wanted to try him out. Not surprisingly getting a ton of success with him (back then his win rate was practically 99% on the top lane). Me using Lee Sin at first didn’t go too well. I immediately lost interest in him and continued with Talon, Wukong and Darius.\r\n\r\nI would progress through to Lvl30 with the majority of the time, me being a top lane bruiser, usually Jax, Wukong and Talon (mid). Darius quickly got laid off as he got too repetitive in gameplay and eventually I got bored of him. This would be when my brother and I would storm through games together. For a period of time, I also remember he loved Draven and I loved Darius, although I was the younger brother and he was the older.\r\nMy brother’s academic life began to stack up on himself, and he played LoL less and less, until I eventually became better at LoL than him, then he thought his time was over, and moved on from his 200 or so normal wins to games where he could start/stop anytime. I became alone.\r\n\r\nThis is when I started to use Lee Sin again. I searched up a few montages and really got into him, going top before going anywhere else with him (even though he was classed as a God Tier jungler at the time). This is when I’ve never had more fun in my life. Lee Sin became my go-to champion for ages. I just couldn’t get bored of him. I learnt to hate him when he was picked on the enemy team too.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAnd here I am now, with 1000+ normal wins and my time is decreasing too. I don’t have the correct circumstances to play LoL PVP anymore, and now I’m just rotting in Co-Ops/ARAM. My most beloved friend is telling me to stop spending money on LoL (which I still plan to, I NEED to buy Winter Wonder Orianna at least when it comes out since I think it’s gonna be a “Legacy/Festive” skin). I’ve spent well over maybe $300~$400 on LoL, I have around 40 skins and I hardly use half of them anymore, but I still believe playing LoL and spending money on it (not necessarily mine) had been worth it all the way for the amount of fun and joy Riot’s brought to me through this game. People say they wasted money on skins etc but I see them as a virtual display of decorations that one would normally see physically placed on a shelf or a desk. I treasure every minute I have and had on LoL, whether it was a Victory or a Defeat. And all this credit goes to Riot Games for over 2 years of my life’s main entertainment. I don’t plan to move on further from LoL, and hope that I can stay with it in the future if I ever get a grip on my spare time. So I would like to say a big thank you to Riot for making LoL simply exist, the endless joy and countless tears have meant much to me on the battlegrounds of Summoner’s Rift (I don’t care about Treeline and Crystal Scar now lol).\r\n\r\nTHANK YOU RIOT GAMES","replies":[{"poster":"Rav","date":"2014-12-12T02:41:30.668+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I want to make this into a movie, OP.
