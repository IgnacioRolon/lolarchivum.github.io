You don&#039;t need to necessarily own them :P\r\n\r\nHere&#039;s my list:\r\n\r\n1. Aether Wing Kayle - Probably the most beautiful skin in my opinion, never use her or have the skin though\r\n2. PROJECT: Fiora - Absolute definition of sleek and shiny. There&#039;s a beautiful artistic touch to her too\r\n3. Warring Kingdoms Xin Zhao - A really traditional but also pretty looking skin, makes Xin Zhao look like how he should be\r\n4. Cosmic Reaver Kassadin - Really gives the cosmic and possibly inter-dimensional feel\r\n5. Temple Jax - An old-fashioned traditional skin, mostly due to my nostalgia since it was one of my first skins ever","replies":[{"poster":"Miicka","date":"2016-09-15T12:50:03.620+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Void Bringer Illaoi: I know its for illaoi but you can't deny she looks sexy af in purple.\n\nPool Party Renekton: I mean come on, best recall for a skin ever.\n\nArcade Riven: Particles :D\n\nPROJECT Zed: The unseen blade is the deadliest...
