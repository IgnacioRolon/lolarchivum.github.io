These tournaments will continue to run fortnightly, seeing a total of four tournaments throughout the OOL, followed by a fifth playoff week to crown the victors. Winners will get their shot at making it into the Challenger League (OCS) and, as such, eventually the Oceanic Pro League (OPL)._\n\nLast split we saw one of our top teams, XeRo Empire (now Team Regicide), automatically qualify into the Oceanic Challenger Series to compete for their shot at the OPL. The breeding grounds of the OOL saw 74 unique teams competing throughout, with 42 of those competing in multiple weeks, consecutively or otherwise.\n\nAnyone can enter the OOL, but competitive teams will gain a natural edge if they play consistently, as this will result in a potentially higher placement at the end of the tournament.\n\n**How can I sign up?**\n\nYour Path to Pro can  be found on Battlefy here!\nhttps://battlefy.com/riot-games-oceanic-open-ladder\nAll of the weeks are available now for sign-up!\n \n**What is the schedule?**\n\nWeek 1 Tournament (February  4 ~ February 5)\nWeek 2 Tournament (February 18 ~ February 19)\nWeek 3 Tournament (March 4 ~ March 5)\nWeek 4 Tournament (March 18 ~ March 19)\nWeek 5 Playoff Tournament  (April 1)\n\nDates are also available on our Leagues Page, or our OOL Battlefy website (Where you also sign up) \n\n**Is there Prizing?**\n\nPrizes shown are per player:\n\n1st &ndash; 3200 RP + Triumphant Ryze\n2nd &ndash; 2800 RP\n3rd &ndash; 2100 RP\n4th &ndash; 1100 RP\n5th-8th &ndash; 800 RP\n9th-16th &ndash; 500 RP\n\n**How do I qualify to the OCS?**\n\nBy accruing points! Points earned directly correlate to where you place at the end of the two day tournament. These tournaments stack up to an end placement where we invite the top teams to fight for their spot in the OCS.\n\n**Preliminaries (Day 1) Points**\n\n1st &ndash; 20 points\n2nd &ndash; 15 points\n3rd &ndash; 10 points\n4th &ndash; 5 points\n5th &ndash; 0 points\n\n**Playoffs (Day 2) Points**\n\n1st Place &ndash; 90 points\n2nd Place &ndash; 60 points\n3rd Place &ndash; 40 points\n4th Place &ndash; 30 points\n5 ~ 8th Place &ndash; 20 points\n9th ~ 16th Place &ndash; 10 points\n17th ~ 32nd Place &ndash; 5 points\n\nFor those who need to find the rules for competing within the OOL, they can be found here!\n[Click me!](https://docs.google.com/document/d/17MJeF00nVhFgRridtbSzZQyq-t04PD5loUR1PQVv2b8/edit?usp=sharing)\n\nFurther details or confirmation on dates, prizes  and structure, can be found on our league page below!\n[Here!](http://oce.lolesports.com/articles/oceanic-open-ladder-54687)\n\nIf that doesn&rsquo;t quite cut it, the Battlefy website once again has all of your needs fulfilled\nhttps://battlefy.com/riot-games-oceanic-open-ladder\n\nThanks a bunch and best of luck on the Rift! \nI&rsquo;ll be around alongside Zeforus one of the tournament admins to answer as many questions as possible up until the events start!\n\nCheers,\n\nRusty.","replies":[{"poster":"lukeenright123","date":"2017-02-14T10:56:58.449+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'm bad at league, feed most games, never done ranked and have ping that averages 300.
