This always happens and lasts for like 30 seconds. It is very detrimental from my playing experience as it hits in champ select as well. It also doesn&#039;t allow me to talk to friends or be invited into game and is frustrating. It happens every like minute or whatever.","replies":[{"poster":"Water","date":"2015-05-17T07:17:16.619+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yes, i've tried 'ipconfig /flushdns' on the command prompt and nothing. \nWhat is IPv6?

Right now (2015), however, the majority of networks still use IPv4 to communicate, so having IPv6 enabled is often redundant. If you have it enabled, sometimes, the client might try using it to communicate when it should use IPv4, so disabling it might work. The way to disable it changes depending on what OS you are on.\n\nCould you please tell me your OS?\n\nP.S.
