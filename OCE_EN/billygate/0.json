This was when it *wasnt *trying to re-establish a connection, which it was doing for the majority of the time.\n\nI eventually reset my router and came back, and my internet was working fine, but I was left with the attempting connection window. And there I remained.\nThe game was long over, so I decided instead of waiting for I dont know how long for the game to recognise that I had a stable connection and the game had been lost, I would end task the game and log back in.\n\nI didnt get an option to rejoin (game was over), all I got was a leaver buster message.\n\nI am not in the habit of leaving games (ever), so this was pretty annoying.\n\nHas anyone else had this experience with the game unable to recognise a reconnection? And what is the best thing to do if this happens? Just wait forever?\n\n**TL;DR Internet issues were fixed, game didnt recognise that, ended task and then got done in for leaving. Anyone have any helpful advice?**","replies":[{"poster":"HORSE OF FORCE","date":"2015-03-20T11:11:31.767+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"You can try testing out a custom game before playing real games on that day to make sure you have a moderately stable connection. Would get rather annoying if you play every day, though.\n\nAs usual, make sure there are no background processes eating up bandwidth.\n\nIf you do lock up in a game, and it's clearly not responding, best thing to do is take action, such as restarting the client. Leavebuster only recognises when you aren't issuing commands to the game, not whether or not the game is actually open on your computer. That means you can close the game, ignoring all the warnings about leaving your team-mates and how you'll get punished, immediately reconnect, and NOT have a leave-marker added to your account because you issued another command within five minutes.\n\nHope this helps.","replies":[]}]}
