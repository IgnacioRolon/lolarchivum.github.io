I&#039;m new to ranked and i was just wondering, how come i went from B1 to S5? I won 3 of my 5 matched promos is this why? if not why do i automatically skip so many ranks?\r\n\r\nThanks in advanced :)","replies":[{"poster":"Er√∏se","date":"2015-12-16T12:59:50.170+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"So the ranks go from 1-5 (1 being the best and 5 being the worst)\nThe ranking system waits for you to get to a 100 lp (league points) before you qualify for a series (a series is where your next few games decide whether you are going to advance up the ranks or stay) so if you are bronze 3 and have 100 lp,you will need to win 2/3 games to advance to bronze 2.However if you are bronze 1 and have a 100 lp,you will need to win 3/5 games to go up a rank(silver) and it goes on all the way to masters. Challenger updates every 24 hour unlike the rest of the ranks.(As far as I know)","replies":[]},{"poster":"Rocka","date":"2015-12-15T11:45:50.403+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The divisions go from:\nBronze 5\nBronze 4\nBronze 3\nBronze 2\nBronze 1 \nSilver 5\nSilver 4\nand so on.
