Got placed in silver, so im looking for someone around that level to support me. Im a solid adc and will follow what my support does in lane. I can carry teamfights well with my positioning.\r\n\r\nI took a long break inbetween but looking to win some games now.\r\n\r\nIf you&#039;re a solid support player, who doesn&#039;t rage at all then add me up. Idc if youre silver gold bronze as long as you have a positive attitude and a good support pool of champs then we can run it. \r\n\r\nBrickk","replies":[{"poster":"BraaadaWilly","date":"2018-02-19T21:42:55.248+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey mate,\n\nSilver Thresh/Bard/Leo/Braum player.\n\nI am a v good Thresh & Bard so if that's the kind of Support you're looking for, add me :)","replies":[]},{"poster":"CALGARY","date":"2018-02-13T03:29:39.027+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'm the best Leona in bronze- which does not say much haha","replies":[]},{"poster":"Exarch Leona","date":"2018-02-12T05:18:06.283+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yo\nMain Leo, Cho and Ali this season. \nCan tank pretty much everything except a Fizz","replies":[]},{"poster":"Boo Nah Nah","date":"2018-02-12T02:23:43.533+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey mate, add me - VenusWilliams \nI main Soraka, Leona and Lux supports","replies":[]},{"poster":"SOOM","date":"2018-02-11T05:00:33.086+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Me","replies":[]},{"poster":"Noodle of Power","date":"2018-02-11T03:15:32.979+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'm silver atm, and used to main support, before moving to mid lane, however I have been looking to get back into the support role more.
