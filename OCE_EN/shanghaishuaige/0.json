The S6 pre-seanson marksman upadte wasn&#039;t a adc buffed patch to my opinion. \r\n  Firstly, the AD items now are too weak. TBH. I know you&#039;ve buffed marksman&#039;s ad at level 1 by 5~8, but so what? The IE,blookthirster, mercu are now 65 attack dmg. This was quite insane i would say. Remembering BT has up to 100dmg back in S3.\r\n  Secondly, the update on marksman play style was silly. Quinn has gone to Top and mid lane while corki goes mid. And you let Graves immerse into the jungle as well. or top.\r\n  I understand that people may say these champs can still go botlane however then they are not maximizing their utility where they can now perform better in a single lane. Bot lane has been a very very crucial lane since S2 that needs ad and sup to cooperate. I love how you buffed sup in S4 so it can actually leads the AD to fight,engage or back.  But now, only a few champs can go bot(YES, EZ LUC and the badly nerfed Kali), cait and mf sometimes. It was boring then usual where graves and corki can dominate the bot lane under some circumstances but countered by the long-range marksman. Now it becomes farm and poke only. Bot lane has also become a place where Top players tele and get kills. Feels like bot players are really dependent on other players in the game where like LB can come down and get few kills and u cant do shieeeet. \r\n  The ad carries have been really weak in different patches. In the tank meta, ADs are threathened by Sion or Hec&#039;s enourmous dmg while they are tank. In the assasin meta, they got melted. Nothing much you can do,. Predictably, Marksman are getting ruined in 6.9 :)\r\n  Let me remind you the reasons that ADs are strong by in the S2~S3.\r\n  The attack dmg was high enough to pay back their hardworking farming for 40mins. They have the movement speed bonus by Phantom (12%)\r\n  The core playstyle for AD carries was hit and run, it depends on attackspeed and movement speed. So ADs can kite the tank while Tank can&#039;t kill them without a Flash. \r\n  Situation now is really different in S6. The tank was a bit too tanky for ADs to kill and they have enough dmg to finish them off. BTW, the CD was also an important factor that ADs can&#039;t survive. Usually we think the Assasins and mid laners have CDs so that if you survive in the first round of team fights, u get a chance of aceing them. The CD are now too short. When you think you are going to finishing off the teamfights, the mid laners now have the abilities cooldowned and destroyes in one sec.\r\n  ADs now dont have enough movement speed to kite or to dodge these abilities. They are too dependent on the flash or their own abilities such as Arcane shift.\r\n  Overall, i reckon ads should have more strong items, longer range( even a bit is enough) and more movement speed bonus. {{champion:18}}","replies":[{"poster":"HarrietStardust","date":"2016-05-11T17:41:23.682+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"As an adc so incredibly sick of top lane/mid/jungle coming in And ganking all kills like gtfo until your actually needed pls.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Crunch","date":"2016-05-07T21:40:51.455+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Riot's idea of the Marksman Update is to create the role around the Type of Champion (Ranged DPS) with a variety of core strengths to each marksmans kit. This doesn't necessarily mean to hold them to the bot lane ADC role, but to create diversity within champions and allow them to be balanced more by the compositions built around them. In the Marksman Update Page, the changes made to the following ADC's are described by Riot as:\n\n\n>{{champion:21}}  \n> Miss Fortune's always been the wombo comboiest of League's champs, so we're souping up her ult and adding in a new mechanic to highlight her trigger-happy tendencies.\n\nShe can still be used to great effect in Wombo Combo. She has seen some struggles through the Tank and Mobility meta, but with the recent Mage changes along with some itemization shifts we may see her come around again. Too soon to tell.\n\n\n> {{champion:133}} \n> We're turning Quinn into League's speediest champion. No-one counters a split push as fast as Demacia's Wings.\n\nSplit Push - Usually done by a top/mid laner. Hence she is used as a ranged counter to split-pushers. Not built for the ADC (Bot) Role. We just happened to see her have so much map pressure due to her high damage.\n\n>{{champion:104}} \n Graves has always been about **getting up close and personal** to whatever he wants to make holes in, and **now he's even stronger at that.** We dare you to dive him.\n\n**_Up close and personal_**. This bit was a bit shady for a while when his Q-R Combo would 2 shot from mid-range. But now that he has been smoothed out a bit, Graves being a Marksman who can deal big damage to bruisers and tanks is well filled by him.\n\n> {{champion:96}} \n> We're refining Kog'Maw into a high-powered artillery void puppy. **Properly protect him, and he'll wreck any team.**\n\nWell we all know exactly how true this is. Guinsoos change will be very interesting to see on Kog. \n\n\n> {{champion:42}} \n> **Corki's still the most magical of the marksmen, **but now the daring bombardier gets one minute to go FULL CORKI whenever he heads back to base.\n\nBecause he's the most Magical, he fills a niche where he was often picked as a flex for mid/bot due to the fact he could provide Magic Damage in the case of an AD Mid (Zed/Yasuo) or taken mid as a MAGIC damage oriented Marksman. The fact that he gets the package which helps with ROAMING and allows huge powerspikes and kill potential gives him a great reason to be a strong mid laner.\n\nSo based on Riot's wording on the update when they first released the changes I believe they've done a reasonably good job of tuning the Marksman role in the right direction. The Tank Meta will not last forever, and with the 6.9 Changes we will see a change. Picking the wrong ADC into the wrong compositions can really hurt you in Season 6, and not having enough DPS or the right composition to peel you or engage the enemy really has shown to be a massive factor. Try to analyze which of the Marksman will be best in each situation when Picking/Banning.","replies":[]},{"poster":"ShanghaiShuaiGe","date":"2016-05-05T05:31:21.433+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"LOL Can the balance team see this?","replies":[]},{"poster":"CHEESYLEEKS","date":"2016-05-04T08:10:28.904+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Qss now only removes certain types of cc ,no more boot enchantments.\n\nMay aswell build steraks,maw,frost mallet,tri force and deadmans plate everygame.","replies":[]}]}
