But hear me out","subforum":"Gameplay & Strategy","embed":{"description":"Having just had an account permabanned for toxicity, im left with a \"toxic\" (hue) taste in my mouth. I get that Everyone wants to have a positive gaming experience, and i fully respect that noone wants to play with a toxic a$$ like me.","url":"http://boards.oce.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/player-behaviour/qLP5z6ru-regards-toxicity-in-oce","image":"http://cdn.leagueoflegends.com/apollo/assets/vb/boards-wallpaper.jpg"},"up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"Now i know that ive been a pretty douchey person, and im not even going to try and lie about what im like. I know im a toxic player. However i feel like Riot are addressing the obvious issues (toxicity) and disregarding less obvious issues (the reasons why people act up). Now i know sometimes i get short tempered and offensively rude. However after surfing these forums alot, ive come to realize that alot of people are in the same boat. Im not condoning my behaviour, however i feel that permabanning at this point, especially while dynamic queueing is up is a bit ludicrous. But thats a whole different kettle of fish.  Anyway, I am proposing a change to the ranked system, at which point I propose Riot unban all currently banned accounts with a &quot;final strike&quot; option due to the fact that i am confident this solution will sort out all further toxicity. \n\nSo without further ado i bring you &quot;the plan&quot;.\n\nA modification to the current ranked system using MMR (MatchMaking Ratio) as a base modifier with a separate equation for individual performance for participation in every kill/ assist and objective taken at a rate of .5 (This has naturally been rushed due to my account being banned, but hoping my proposed plan will fix that). Now first the boring stuff. Maths.\n\nFirst in the event of a win. Lets assume you&#039;re at neutral MMR (20 lp for a win, 20 for a loss).  you go 20/0/20 and solo carry a game. you take 10 towers and pretty much win the game by yourself. The (0.5 ratio gets factored in) now you gain 20 lp for your win + 20/0/20 (gaining 0.5 per kill or assist and losing 0.5 per death) therefore this person would gain in total 20lp (victory mmr base) + (20/0/20 x 0.5 = 10/0/10) + 10 towers (x .5) would equal a whopping 45 lp.  I know this sounds excessive but lets also remind that just because this person carried one game, doesnt ensure they will do it again. Also remember that their teammates will be getting bonuses for objectives and kills. \n\nNow lets assume that out lovely solo carry friend in the above example LOST his game &quot;GASP!&quot;, but alas my good friends, it happens.\n\nNeutral MMR modifier (-20) + kill/ assist modifier 20/0/20 (x 0.5) = 20 + objective modifier (10 towers x 0.5) = 5 means he still comes out with 25lp. \n\nNow lets try a different tact. A loss in which someone intentionally feeding goes 0/40/0. Factor in neutral mmr (20 for win, -20 for loss) annnnnddd math.  0/40/0 (x-0.5) death modifier in this instance means this lovely chap gains -20 (from mmr modifier) and 0/40/0 (x-0.5) = -20.\nSo this lovely person loses a whopping 40 lp. \n\nIn the event that the team actually manage to win this even with le feederino he gains +20 (mmr modifier) and loses 0/40/0 (x0.5) = -20 so he gains..... nothing. nada. 0. zilch. \n\nNow im expecting a bit of resistance from people who are like &quot;i clawed my way up from the pits of hell to get where i am&quot;. I apologize as this seems like its favouring people carrying, and im not going to lie, it does. But as its all about objectives/ kills/ deaths noone misses out, junglers getting dragons, barons, rift herald wont be forgotten, supports getting assists, (maybe factor in a modifier for counterjungling, or for wards and pinks placed? still in progress) but isnt it worth swallowing ones pride on this in order to be able to improve the OCE community?  &quot;But wait, all im seeing is maths and numbers, how is this going to remove toxicity, how is this going to make previously permabanned accounts behave? whats to stop them going back into their old ways and being a drain on the oce league community?&quot;.\n\nWell heres my theory behind it. I know in my instance alot of my anger and frustration was at a team not listening, or following my lead, yes i know lads/ ladettes, im not their dad, they dont have to listen to me, but as a jungler, it means alot  when my team folllow my lead.  I feel that If this system was in place while i was playing i maybe might have got less frustrated (no excuse for my behaviour and language admittedly, as id feel like my individual performance mattered more, and that even if i (like the lovely example above where the chap who lost went 20/0/20 and pushed 10 towers, still came out with +25 lp, id feel less inclined to be abusive to a team for underperforming, disregarding my advice, as id have known as long as i did well id still finish ahead. \n\nItll encourage more teamwork taking objectives and teamfighting, as well as more splitpushing and focussed gameplay. By having a slight modifier for wards placed or for counterjungling done it also allows there to be more pressure on junglers doing their job as well\n\nMy intentions in thinking up this idea are purely selfish in nature, but i realize riot arent going to reinstate my account or the other permabanned peoples accounts without good reason. Some kind of buffer, reassurance that people can be reformed. I feel that this is the golden egg. Im available for questions! (seeing as i cant play my account at the moment, fingers crossed this solves that){{champion:90}}","replies":[{"poster":"BarryButcher","date":"2016-02-17T11:13:39.564+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Making your gain LP based on K/D/A is a short sighted idea.\n\nMany many many games, theres a 2/8/4 Nasus who took 4 towers and backdoored the win despite the scoreline being 40-20.\nAlso what it would mean is, if its, 0-8 scoreline after 5 mins. people will afk to save their LP.

If this chess player was consistently winning in a fewer amount of moves, then dont you think that shows that he's either got some full proof plan hes executing that consistently works, or that the other people he faces are just completely dominated by him? Both examples show that he should be moving up in order to be with people who stretch him, and challenge him more","replies":[{"poster":"Strat","date":"2016-02-17T16:41:14.909+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":">Or do you feel someone who consistently plays above their elo should be punished as well?\n\nIf you consistently play above your Elo, you'll have a win rate that's a lot higher than 50%, which means you'll be gaining MMR given 10-20 games. In reality, many people perceive that they're playing at a high level when they're not. Read up on the [Dunning-Kruger effect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dunning–Kruger_effect), it explains what you're experiencing.

Why assume Riot hasn't put any thought into it?\n\nLook, a ranking system rewards a player for contributing to wins, and punishes a player for contributing to losses. The *only* foolproof way to measure this is to take averages of wins and losses and adjust it based on the skill level of your opponents.

Of course not, sometimes your team mates will let you down, or sometimes the enemy team will give you an easy win. But adding extra factors based on opinions just serves as needless noise in the statistical data. It introduces what's known as a \"statistical bias\" towards certain measures of performance. It's really difficult to tune it - people do PhDs on this sort of thing (forms of indeterminate multi-variable statistics). In the end, given how quickly the LoL meta changes, it's basically impossible to tune it perfectly because each time something changes it'd disrupt the balance again.\n\nWhy bother when you have a perfectly good measure of performance - winning or losing? It's OK to get it wrong from a statistical perspective, because as long as you play enough games (50-100+) it will ALWAYS correct itself to an approximately correct MMR.\n\n>If this chess player was consistently winning in a fewer amount of moves, then dont you think that shows that he's either got some full proof plan hes executing that consistently works\n\nNot necessarily at all, it could be due to your play style that you either win or lose the chess match sooner. If you look at chess grandmasters, some will have identical win rates while having very different average turn counts at checkmate. Does that mean that the guy with a higher average turn count is worse at chess? No, it just means he has a different strategy - being more defensive at the beginning and setting up a winning position for a later part of the game.","replies":[{"poster":"Azmarius","date":"2016-02-18T02:47:40.578+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> If you consistently play above your Elo, you'll have a win rate that's a lot higher than 50%, which means you'll be gaining MMR given 10-20 games.

Is always positive and supportive, yet their team consistently lets them down. Dont you feel this player should be rewarded somehow for their \"team contribution\" on an individual level as opposed to skins at the end of the season for \"being a good sport this year\". Free stuff doesnt improve ones ranking is all im saying. And i dont feel mmr in and of itself is a \"perfectly good measure\" of performance. In any \"team game\" the better team will win. But what if you dont have the better team? I had a game where i got queued with the same guy today for example. He went 3/11 and 3/9 in each game respectively, wouldnt listen, wouldnt say anything, was just a real pain in my a$$. Kept roaming and letting his lux roam (picked lee into lux). 3 consecutive games i was paired with this guy, i was positive , supportive, begged him to listen. begged him to stop roaming. Nothing. This goes to show no matter how positive you are, how good you were doing in your lane, sometimes it doesnt matter. \nAnd yeah i understand how multivariables are hard to account for, but I dont think the meta changing should modify a base formula that much, but youre right, it wont be tuned perfectly, but i feel any kind of tuning is a step up on mmr being a flawed system and only taking a \"teams\" stats into account","replies":[{"poster":"Strat","date":"2016-02-18T06:55:05.173+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":">I think currently sitting at around a 67% winrate\n\nMore like 55% win rate (67% is only on one of your champs). Still, if you maintained that 55% win rate you would have likely gotten out of Bronze without many problems. Just gotta grind the games out.\n\n>Lets say a player consistently sacrifices for the team, splitpushs, dies securing dragon and baron, tanks enemy dragon, lures them away from team so they can take objectives\n\nYou list all these things, right, but half these things can be terrible plays in the wrong context.\n\nSacrifices for the team: situational, can be good or bad.\n\nSplit pushing: rarely if ever a good idea in low Elo (this rarely works in Plat+ yet alone Bronze Elo). It's a good play in a perfect scenario, but the blame rests on you for split pushing when you know your team won't provide pressure/stay alive on the other end\n\nDies securing dragon: almost never worth it\n\nDies securing baron: usually worth it, the one thing on the list that is usually a good play.\n\nTanks enemy dragon: what?\n\nLures them away from team: aka you got caught overextended while \"split pushing\" without waiting for your team to get into position (or backing off if your team isn't cooperating).\n\n>But what if you dont have the better team\n\nYour team is RANDOMLY chosen from a skill level. What does this mean? It means sometimes the enemy team will be better, and sometimes your team will be better, but on average (over the course of many games) the teams will be the same. What's the only thing that is constant in this equation? YOU. If you are playing consistently above the skill level, then your team will ON AVERAGE be better than the enemy team, winning you games.\n\n>but i feel any kind of tuning is a step up on mmr being a flawed system\n\nHey, we haven't established any form of proof that MMR is flawed yet.\n\nEdit: I know you're perma'd, but if you end up leveling a new account to 30 feel free to add me (reply to this post any time in the future with the summoner name so I know it's you). I'll be happy to spectate some games and give feedback on how you could be winning your games more easily. I've been Bronze 5 (300 Elo in Season 2), and now my main is Plat 1, so I've learned a lot about the game and what separates lower Elo from higher Elo players.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Rcade Circles","date":"2016-02-17T10:48:45.975+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Holy shit that was good.
