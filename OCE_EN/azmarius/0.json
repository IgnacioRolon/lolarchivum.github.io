I get that Everyone wants to have a positive gaming experience, and i fully respect that noone wants to play with a toxic a$$ like me. But lets take a step back and look at other forms of toxicity besides the obvious ones. In games where I call early objectives, or that elusive 21 min baron, and noone shows up, or i say &quot;keep lanes busy so i can sneak a dragon&quot;, pink it, and then start it, only to be ganked by mid and bot while my team continues farming. Or aceing the enemy team at 25 mins and then calling a baron only to have people go back to lane and keep farming. Now isnt not listening to a good call a form of toxicity as well? or when a lane feeds so you purposely get 5 man ganked by pushing hard so other lanes can push, only to have them ignore it and continue farming. I get that no individual person is labelled as a sole shotcaller, but if there is a lane behind theyre obviously doing something wrong, and should let other lanes be the playmakers and help them out. Eventually when you go from like 4/0 to like 8/15 from trying to win a game by making openings noone takes, so you get angry and lash out. I&#039;ve had responses for this from &quot;its bronze&quot; to &quot;then play in a 5 man premade&quot;, but do you have to really be in a 5 man premade for a team to want to win?  I get that there is a huge skill disparity, and I shouldnt expect much from my elo (bronze) but if people arent going to take advice, then how does one win?.  Riot need to implement a system in conjunction to the &quot;mmr&quot; system that rewards players based on individual performance. Rewarding them positively for kills/ assists/ aiding in objectives (maybe adding more lp) as well as punishing people who have excessive deaths (maybe losing more lp) . I feel that this will decrease toxicity as a whole, because Then it wont matter if you go 20/0/20 and lose, you&#039;ll still be rewarded for doing a good job. I feel i speak for alot of people who have tried to solo carry a game, only to have teammates who dont/ cant listen (whats the point in having a ping system when noone follows them?).

Alright, you're already in lane so, lets get a turret._\n \n Remember **any** objective is better than nothing. \n\n If people are greedy and just farm after kills, get them to take enemy **Blue buff**, **Scuttle Crab**, **Rift Herald**, literally anything is good. If they wont even move, then go to lane and help them push!\n\nThe best play is the one that works. I consider it a miracle in itself that you can place 5 people in a room, give them 1 min and 30 sec, and they'll come up with a half decent team most of the time.\n\n+ Sometimes people and organizations can't reach an agreement in centuries. \n**_Why?_**\n**_Because they aren't willing to give up some ground and compromise for a different play._**\n\nJust something to think about :)","replies":[{"poster":"Azmarius","date":"2016-02-16T09:07:39.128+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Agree with everything you just typed.

Also while reading your \"tactical disagreement\" link, and riot has said to mute or ignore people who are flaming, and \"If muting or ignoring a player doesn't stop the negative experience, please use the reporting feature.\"\n\nSo that should mean noone gets reported, the only reason why people then get reported is because people don't mute them, in which case then people not muting them isnt adhering to riots suggestion for dealing with toxicity. \nI get that people shouldn't have to put up with the kinda abuse i dish out, but when you try and solo carry a game and people are just unskilled (no longer reportable)  and don't listen to the people trying to get a win for them makes me hulk out. I understand some people have bad games, hell I've done it where I've just been totally outplayed and have fed the hell out of my lane, but i'm all for the advice, someone telling me to become bait, or what not in order to allow every other lane to win.

Its like having a relationship you put 100% into and the other person cant be bothered. It gets draining and exhausting, and tiring and frustrating, and after a while you just dont want to see the other person anymore. More i think about it, a crappy relationship is exactly the same as solo queue.\n\n> Even then it's better to achieve nothing than to try and force something your team won't help with and end up dying.

The thing is i could go 15/0 and still lose if i dont force objectives. Constantly butchering my KDA to try and make them LCS bigplays. The thing here is riot have made it pretty clear that they dont want people to be reported for \"differing in opinions\". But im confused then by their \"be a team phiosophy\". They casually encourage teamwork, but dont enforce it. The only thing they seem to enforce is toxicity, and flagrant violations of the rules. Makes me wonder why theres no system in place to actually enforce teamwork.  \n\n> One thing to note here is that dodging does NOT affect your hidden MMR, whereas losing a game does.

But i feel riot have to rework their system so you dont get an automatic loss for dodging in your promos. I think that ideas gotta go. Theyre basically forcing you at knifepoint to play a game with a troll or something you know youre going to lose, rather than dodging because of that instaloss. I think scratch that idea, make it you still lose lp but dont get an instaloss in promos. Maybe also have a reduced dodge timer, maybe 50%. So instead of 5 mins its 2'50\", and instead of 10/ 20 mins its 5 and 10 minutes respectively\n\nThanks for the well thought out reply Arf Arf Arf Arf","replies":[{"poster":"Arf Arf Arf Arf","date":"2016-02-16T14:33:30.782+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":">More i think about it, a crappy relationship is exactly the same as solo queue.\n\nIt's true, soloQ is draining. But being positive is critical. Being negative only lowers your chances of winning. Worst case scenario: you make your team mate rage quit or AFK.

At the end of the day, mathematically speaking the people on the enemy team are making as bad plays as the ones on your team.

At the end of the day alot of people say to me \"its a game\", and it is. But its also been labelled as a competitive sport by definition.

Do they look at your overall score? objectives taken? gold/ cs. Do they see how hard youve tried before ultimately losing? Or do they just see the black and white proof of being toxic?.
