Sometimes, when late game rears its head around, it's almost always fatal if you get 'charmed' by an Ahri. My best advice would be to harass and poke her early game and try get some early kills. Charm has a high cooldown early game, bait her into using it and save your all in combo for that moment when charm is on cooldown. I suggest using a champion that can lane bully and snowball hard like Katarina or Talon.\n\nCountering her Spirit Rush can be a pain as well, as it has an offensive use as well as a defensive, making it somewhat unfair. Try to burst her down before she has a chance to ult. \n\nI can help you a bit more if you could let me know what champions you play, but hope this info helps anyway","replies":[{"poster":"rainbowskillmove","date":"2017-01-16T01:42:45.612+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thanks man","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Nightjar","date":"2017-01-16T20:13:33.840+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"my suggestion, play syndra, yasou, zed or fizz. Ahri won't have a fun time against these midlaners or basically anyone who can dodge/block her charm and 100-0 her.
