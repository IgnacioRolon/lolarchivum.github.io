I am unable to select a Champion,  Summoner Spell, or Rune / Mastery Page. I can&#039;t even select a champion on the side of the screen to view their abilities and lore. \r\n\r\nThe only way I have found my way out of this glitch is by selecting the Champion, Runes, and Masteries I want to use, before selecting teleport. However, after the game is finished and I am met with the scoreboard and stuff, I am still unable to select anything. I have to restart the client to get it to function again.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis is super annoying and has costed me a 5 minute probation\r\n\r\n{{summoner:12}}","replies":[{"poster":"GearedSanity","date":"2016-01-14T16:38:01.384+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Having the same problem... :(\nHopefully it will be fixed soon","replies":[]},{"poster":"Mêltên","date":"2016-01-14T14:41:51.928+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It happens to me everytime i change my Summoner :(\nBecouse of that i have to leave 2 games","replies":[]},{"poster":"DatDaemon","date":"2016-01-14T07:40:57.033+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It happens to me even when I dont take TP\nThis is beyond ridiculous.","replies":[]}]}
