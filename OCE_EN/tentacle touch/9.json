Not ranked teams, ranked.\n\nSo you can still Solo Queue like before, just that they added options.","replies":[{"poster":"Tentacle Touch","date":"2016-02-07T01:55:42.284+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"http://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/miscellaneous/HGblb9fH-the-2016-ranked-season-updates-on-dynamic-ranked-and-your-feedback\n\nThey have plans to add a pure solo queue (no duo) in the coming time after dynamic was added.","replies":[{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2016-02-07T02:33:24.303+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"No specific timetable yet, only that it's soon.

More likely they thought that dynamic would remove the need for it, and I think for the most part they are right, but there are people who have grown accustomed to and prefer the less team oriented experience of true solo queue. It is more likely they were simply not prepared to create a solo queue to work with the new system and so it's taking them a bit to get it together.","replies":[{"poster":"Tentacle Touch","date":"2016-02-07T08:34:14.161+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Probably, the other theory was just me with my tin foil hat tightened.","replies":[{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2016-02-07T08:46:06.798+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Only a hat?
