You know we aren&#039;t going to quit anytime soon.\nEvery evening after school I go on my computer and play the game with the same mentality, \"My team will win and get along\". First game I lose because someone took someones blue buff and they got all butt hurt and start auto clicking mid lane to feed. I try to convince the person to let it go and work as a team and he  says to me \"Mid laner took my blue buff i want him to lose\". Its just not fair to 3 people when 2 people have some kind of fall out in a maa\\tch and its a sure loss because someone is just running into mid lane 24/7 while spamming in all chat \" Buy Mejias and Occult\". Thats not it, Matches are already lost due to many more reasons :-\n1) Auto locks in a champion and someone picks a champ with tele and ghost and runs in again and again into the players lane.\n2) People get so butt hurt when u tell them something new that they call you shit and feed ur lane and say this will teach u a lesson to shit talk people.\n3) this one is the best one - Someone who hass lost 3 games in a row says fuck u all and feeds for no reason purely because someone else ruined his game so now he ruins other peoples games.\nToxic people breed more toxic people. I myself find myself in a \"i dont give a fuck\" mood that i myself become toxic.\n\nYou really need to fix this shit, specially in OCE. it is getting out of hand\nPlease let us kick people in champ select if they are being toxic already. only kick them out if its is a 3-2 vote. ( This will cancel out the toxic Duos as well)\n\nLet us lose less LP if we have an AFK.\n\nAND MOST OF ALL BRING TRIBUNAL BACK. We need to punish toxic behavior. There are people telling other peopel to go get cancer and burn in hell or stuff like i hope your family dies of aids.\n PLEASE just do something! instead of just sitting there sucking up money!!\n\n\nIts not just bronze its in Every ELO!","replies":[{"poster":"WEETBIX 4 BREKKI","date":"2015-04-27T12:05:37.287+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"***","replies":[{"poster":"Frankoo","date":"2015-04-27T14:13:07.839+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"They wont though, most of the league player base in australia is aged less than 16. at that age they are going through a phase of self importance, they will bring down people with them if they feel attacked.

This behaviour is unacceptable and we are working on making the game a more enjoyable experience for all. I read over your ideas, and it sounds like you are quite passionate on the subject and looking at different solutions. I worked with some designers and here is some feedback we had for you: \n\n_**\"Please let us kick people in champ select if they are being toxic already. only kick them out if its is a 3-2 vote. ( This will cancel out the toxic Duos as well)\" **\n_\n\n- We have looked into a kick vote before and found that players wanted to use this to kick players for all kinds of behaviour, such as - not liking the bans, not like the team comp, \"poor\" champ selection, etc...This can actually increase the time to get into game considerably. When we ran this test, 60% of games resulted in someone being kicked from the lobby and then you begin the process all over again. That just didn't seem like a great experience either. Something we could do in Oceania is ban players that we find dodge in champ select often and continuously have a negative impact for players.\n\n_**\"Let us lose less LP if we have an AFK.\"**_\n\n\n - We are testing the idea of giving players the option to reset a game within the first 2 mins, if there is a 4v5 situation, and no First Blood has been taken/given. We feel this is a good spot to do this, because the game hasn't really developed, and it's obvious that a player has not been a part of the game from the start. If testing proves successful, this is something we are planning to roll out. While it doesn't adjust your LP loss, as you suggested, this does feel like a fair balance to all players. I personally feel bad when the other team has an afk, and would be happy to reset at that point, before too much of my time has been invested.\n\nAt Riot, we want to help players understand what bad looks like, and give them an opportunity to get better. I have worked on many MMO's before joining Riot and believe me, I was a big fan of just swinging the ban hammer back in the day. I now look back, and realize that players need feedback, we all need to understand the why, and that can help us improve.\n\nWe do have a number of systems in place and some in the works (like Tribunal) here in Oceania. You can read all about that in our FAQ here: http://boards.oce.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/announcements/L65wrRYe-player-behaviour-faq\n\nStay positive and continue to be a leader in game, I do believe that positivity can be contagious.\n\nBest,\nRiot Cochese","replies":[{"poster":"Frankoo","date":"2015-05-01T13:02:18.505+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"\"Something we could do in Oceania is ban players that we find dodge in champ select often and continuously have a negative impact for players.\" - This is not a good idea as people leave champ select due to reasons such as people threatening to feed, or locking in mid when someone has already locked in mid, or just being a straight out jerk to everyone. People leave not because they are toxic they leave because they dont want to avoid negative experience or lose LP","replies":[{"poster":"Project Xayah","date":"2015-05-01T13:35:31.269+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> People leave not because they are toxic they leave because they dont want to avoid negative experience or lose LP\n\nBut it doesn't matter what their reasoning is, they're still *breaking the rules* therefore they should get punished, same as a person who feeds would get punished for *breaking the rules*.","replies":[{"poster":"Frankoo","date":"2015-05-01T14:19:58.891+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I know where ur coming from but we need to fix the disease not the symptom.

I agree. Just game back from a nasty ranked game. My adc seemed quite new to ranked and though was quite mixed up with builds, the whole team hammered us (Yes, I was supp) when I defended her. Saying things like \"This botline, can't do S***\", \"probably clicked ranked by accident\", and calling us \"stupid\" and telling us to \"f*** up\". Not even that, we were dying and in a team fight and they literally stood still behind us doing nothing! As if watching us die and not to add, they were \"laughing\". There was worse that I don't want to remember. Like seriously, people can have a bad game and that's understandable because everyone has that. But, not only language and commenting, but behaviour like 6-year olds was unnecessary. This toxic and salty behaviour can be so negatively impacting on one's mental state of mind not just throughout the game, but after the game as well. Like you said, the toxic spreads and breeds more toxic people.\n\nI ended up trying too add those 3 toxic people with only one accepting. I tried to explain how unnecessary such talk and language. He seemed to understand but eventually replied, \"But I wasn't even as savage as the teemo or vicktor\". Got me wondering if they even know that such language is cruel and rude. \n\nRiot, I believe you should focus and put in more towards developing and strengthening the Tribunal system. So many school kids play these games nowadays and it really affects their behaviour in and away from the game as human beings. Players and innocent players are getting hammered day by day, and with more feedback and warnings, it can really make a difference. \n\n**Please hear us out Riot!**","replies":[]},{"poster":"FacePalm77","date":"2015-09-25T13:35:12.948+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Give the power back to the people.

Talking to people just wastes time, you could be warding, focusing more on your lane or even looking at the mini-map. You'll find by taking part in arguments you'll miss CS and lane pressure by typing all the time. I think if you wanna climb the only thing you should type is \"gg\" at the end and \"gj\" when someone makes a decent play. \n\nI definitely agree on your less LP loss idea though, only issue would be people harassing others to leave games for less LP loss. Tribunal would be nice too, why don't we just share with the NA tribunal?
