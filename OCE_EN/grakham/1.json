People seem to forget this is an objective based game. One person dead means you have the man advantage around the map for and you should be pushing down objectives. Not every kill needs to go to the ADC etc.\n\nFrom what I could see you missed your net and karma got the auto attack off BEFORE you pressed ult. You were also out of auto range so to me I'd be securing that kill regardless. The amount of times I've left a 1 hit auto kill for my ADC (as support) and they've failed to secure it is simply amazing.","replies":[]},{"poster":"tts01008","date":"2017-11-10T23:58:39.066+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"One single kill steal does not need to be discussed at all.  The main benefit of killing someone is that you gain the advantage of taking objectives from the opponent afterwards.  Unless the support keeps on intentionally taking kills from the adc, which is not going to benefit the team in the long run as sups have lower gold cap, there is not much to discuss.","replies":[]}]}
