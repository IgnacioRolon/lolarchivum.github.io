You say its really rare your teammates win their lanes, but for every guy that wins lane, someone has to lose lane. Half them will be on your team, half will be on the other team. If you think this isn't true then either a) your counterpart on the enemy team is having a greater impact on the other lanes than you are (through ganking, roaming, improving morale etc.);  b) you're biased and only notice/remember when your teammates do poorly and not when they do well; or c) your assessment of which guy is actually winning the lane is wrong.\n\nI feel like you're also asking the wrong questions. Instead of asking \"How do I win a game when every lane feeding 10 minutes into the game\", you should be thinking, \"what can I do to stop them from feeding in the first place\". If they're really that bad and there was nothing you could do, then you don't win that game, simple as that. Even someone significantly better than the people they're playing with will probably only win 60% or so of their games, focus more on turning the tides in the closer games rather than getting caught up on the ones where your team is vastly outmatched.","replies":[{"poster":"FISTFACE","date":"2015-08-10T06:44:45.965+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hard to communicate with ignorant players that don't respond to pings.

Focus on yourself, and making sure you play well (winning lane, good farm, etc.) If you play well, then you have a higher chance of winning the game. Even if you don't win, you will improve as a player, making it likely that you will win more games in the future. Overall, try not to think \"did we win the game\". Try to think \"did I do well?\"","replies":[]}]}
