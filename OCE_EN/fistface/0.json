Such as a the most common AFK  player then there is the kid that rages at not getting their lane but still locking in there champ and going stubborn and swearing the rest of the game at the team ( I  was forced to go Rammus ADC many times). Lastly there are the people that are ignorant for their team and just purposely K.S for the rest of the match for a better score and use horrible English/Ebonics while scolding at the team for every kill they get, then say that they are a freaking Microbiologist. This may sound like whining but i have had enough of these types of players, is there any way to get better ones or do i have to buy RP to change regions? Because my friends always seem to end up getting great teammates every game.","replies":[{"poster":"Frankoo","date":"2015-06-01T11:47:51.531+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You dont you are in the heart of toxicity","replies":[]},{"poster":"BarryButcher","date":"2015-06-01T07:55:11.075+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Duo.\n\nI used to think to myself, I don't want to duo because I want to see how good I am personally without help. But I have come to realise duoing isn't about \"getting help\" its about reducing the retardation factor by 1.\n\nI've duo'd with a friend of mine and so far we are 11-3. Although it doesnt completely stop getting the AFK's and trolls and whingers, it does help to know there is atleast 1 other person on the team you can rely on.","replies":[{"poster":"FISTFACE","date":"2015-06-01T08:10:31.067+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"But even if i duo with my friend there is always that guy on my team that happens to have one of the gaming disabilities listed above.","replies":[{"poster":"BarryButcher","date":"2015-06-01T08:27:03.302+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Me and my friend get them too. But the fact is me and my friend work so well together we can have a top laner or a jungler go 0-8 in lane and threaten to afk and we will FORCE them to win the game.\n\nYou + your friend should be enough to carry a game even with an idiot. You think we went 14 games without \"idiots\"? I'd say there was only 3 games from the 14 where the team was actually really good and worked well together. The other times you force your team to win by putting them on your back and not raging at them. That's the most important part. Don't rage or argue with them, its makes things worse 9/10 times. Don't even offer advice, stay silent.\n\nKeep your cool, trust yourself, trust your friend. Carry.","replies":[]}]}]}]}
