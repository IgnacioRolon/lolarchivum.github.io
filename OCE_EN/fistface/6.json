Making the match unfair as $h!t, the team can&#039;t be carried as the person afk either plays an important role or has  most of the cc. Or it becomes  a 3v5. Riot please make a system that allows people to join. I have had enough of afk&#039;s and would like something to be done, reporting the afk doesn&#039;t make a difference as the next match I get matched up with another afk. Idk why but whenever my team has a lead on the other team then a teammates randomly quits the match. Or my  teammate just goes afk from the very start of the game.","replies":[{"poster":"CyanShinobi","date":"2015-09-01T08:34:22.979+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"There also needs to be a way for the server to test your internet connection when logging in. If your internet isn't strong enough/stable enough to have a game come up with a notification saying \"You do not have the minimum internet requirements to play this game at this time. Refresh your router or contact your server provider\", or something along those lines. All games have minimum requirements to play. LoL should too.","replies":[]}]}
