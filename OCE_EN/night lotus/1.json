It has been almost eighteen days since the troops of Noxus marched into our land&hellip;\nI guess I finally saw some sign of life in the distant village, I couldn&#039;t tell whether it was just my misery of surviving a massacre or just looking at false hope. \n\nI finally reached a house.  \n\nAs I got closer, I could hear the sounds of a child screaming and crying. I walked into the house and what I saw I couldn&#039;t believe... It was a nine year old girl sitting down in the corner, whimpering in fear. I knew I needed to travel alone. I&rsquo;m a pathetic nobody and I can&rsquo;t even save those I care about. \nYet I couldn&#039;t just leave her there, could I? \n\nI could see her parents lying down, their bodies coated by wounds of swords and axes, yet their hands were still holding each other&rsquo;s with a note saying &quot;you are the blessed child of Ionia; may the spirits of our elders now walk with you&quot;. \n\nI walked slowly over the blood stained floor to the girl. As I got close, she started shaking and burst into tears. She pulled her old, grey blanket close around her, and stared solemnly at her blood-stained boots. Her angelic, silver hair covered her face and she refused to look at me, slowly shuffling away from me as I approached her cautiously and calmly. \n\n&quot;Hey there, don&#039;t worry I&#039;m here to help you...&quot; She turned around, and looked at me with big gloomy eyes with tears streaming down her face. \n&quot;What&#039;s happening to me, what&#039;s going on?!!!&quot; she exclaimed in shock, her voice sounding like an endless echo. I kept staring at her eyes as they flashed a deep midnight purple.\n\nI scanned her face.  It was smeared in her parent&rsquo;s blood, mixed in with yesterday&rsquo;s dirt. A small four-point star in-between her violet eyes. There was a ragged scratch on her cheek and the symbol on the back of her neck. It looked almost demon like, it was a death black circle with midnight violet lines running and intertwining like snakes into the middle. The mark of those with great power&hellip; A transcendent.\n\nWhile the marks shook me to my core, she was alone and there was no time for questions. I put it out of my mind and started talking in a calm loving voice.\n &quot;Here here honey, it&rsquo;s okay don&#039;t worry everything is going to be okay&quot; I hugged her to give her some warmth to comfort her. I expected a hug in return, but she just remained pale and stiff. \n\n&quot;Wh-wh-why is everyone dead! Why are mommy and daddy dead?&quot; She stuttered, I could hear the pain in her voice, it was miserable. \n&quot;I don&#039;t know...&rdquo; I lied to her.. &ldquo;But I don&#039;t want to leave you here. Okay?&quot;, I asked pleadingly. \n\nShe started to settle. Over the sound of her diminishing sobs, we both heard the ear-piercing sounds of the Noxian battle horns. She tensed at the sound, and quickly agreed, wiping her remaining tears &quot;Okay, what is your name though?&quot;\n\n&quot;My name is... I can&rsquo;t really remember my own.. Well what&#039;s yours little missy?&quot;\n\n&quot;My name is Syndra&quot;, she said.\n\n &quot;That&#039;s a beautiful name you have Syndra. Now let&rsquo;s get out of here before anyone finds us.&rdquo;\n\nWe could hear the screams of an angry mob close to our house; obviously looking for people. Another slaughter was about to begin, I needed to get her out of there.\n\nSyndra quickly turned towards me and shook me. She yelled at me as some of their shrieks turned into blood-curdling screams, screaming out a horrifying thirst for the blood of the Ionians. &ldquo;Help look for the door!&rdquo; I could hear the fear in her voice, I could tell it wasn&rsquo;t her first encounter with these nightmarish people, nor would it be her last.\n\n&ldquo;Well where the hell is it!?&rdquo; I exclaimed in haste. \n\nI scanned the room with her, kicking and shoving the broken books and furniture off the floor. Syndra&rsquo;s eyes widened as we heard the sounds of the neighbouring house get torn down by the vicious mob with the screams of the family inside. We hastened in speed knowing that we were next.\n&ldquo;Any luck!?&rdquo; I yelled out to her.\n\n&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t have a clue! Hurry pleassseee!&rdquo; I heard the sound of her breathing, it quickened incredibly.\n\nI looked away from her and I saw a glimmer of light from under her parents&rsquo; corpses. I dreaded that it would have to be there of all places. \n&ldquo;Syndra, the damn door&rsquo;s where you parents are at!&rdquo; I choked out. \n\n&quot;C&#039;mon we need to get moving before they find us!&rdquo;\n\n&quot;Alright let&#039;s move quickly then&quot;.\n\nWe moved their bodies, I didn&rsquo;t move them that roughly. The girl saw her parents murdered, that isn&rsquo;t easy. She pulled on the handle and it opened the door. It made a loud creaking sound as she opened it. She jumped in and gestured for me to get in. I was just about to and then I saw the note her parents had left her. It was double sided, I didn&rsquo;t notice that before. I grabbed the note in haste and entered the passageway slamming the door behind us. From inside the passage we could hear the screams of more families. As we heard them we made a run for it in the passages. The mob just crushed down a door and heard us. I turned around to suddenly realise it was the door behind us. I could see the bloodstained faces of the maddened people. They screamed like maniacs as they bolted towards us. We sprinted toward the doorway at the end of the tunnel. \n\n&ldquo;RUN! RUN SYNDRA RUN!&rdquo; I yelled out in fear and haste.\n\n&ldquo;COME ON! MOVE IT!&rdquo; she replied in a terrified voice.\n\nThey were tailing us, we burst through the barrier ahead of us and bolted towards the closed shelter. Then when I thought we might be safe.. They caught us&hellip; We were captured and brought back to their prisoner camps. We were regularly starved and forced into forging weapons for Noxus, farming for their foods, mining into the deepest of mines, forcing us to do all of this or risk losing our lives. I regularly told Syndra that things would be okay, and that we would one day be free from this nightmare. But as the months went by, things seemed to become worse and worse for us. It became harder to convince Syndra that we would be okay, the girl&rsquo;s powers as a transcendent grew stronger, and it became increasingly difficult to protect her from the authorities.  \n\nThen one day when we were both on our ways to our small shelter provided by the Noxians. I had decided it was time to show her the back of the note which her parents had left behind. It explained that Syndra was destined to rule over Ionia, but her path was one of chaos. She had started crying and the nearby Noxians had noticed Syndra&rsquo;s eyes turn into a deep purple, she couldn&rsquo;t hide it this time. I remember vividly their voices roaring &ldquo;LOOK! THAT&rsquo;S MAGIC, SEIZE THEM!&rdquo; They threw me down onto the wet mud and pinned me to the ground as I watched my poor precious Syndra cry and beg them to let her go, only to be imprisoned and chained up like an animal on the spot. I felt the axe of Darius himself piece through my neck as Syndra screamed, I remember seeing her eyes shine brighter than I&rsquo;d ever seen them, her scream sounded so murderous and fearful. \n\nI had died&hellip; \n\nSyndra&rsquo;s magic had managed to resurrect me as a spirit, however I was invisible to the mortal plain. I was bound to watch over Syndra as her spirit, her elder, her family for the rest of eternity. It was then I felt most connected to her heart, and soul. The closest I had ever been to her.\n\nAs the years passed the war slowly died down and Syndra was saved. The village elders that took her in had erased her memory of the tragic events of the war in an effort to lead Syndra onto the correct path in life. They manipulated her memories to have shown her to live a normal life, one where she was reckless with her powers as a child in order to have fun and show off to her friends. She was then given reason to be sent to the village&rsquo;s old mage in an effort to restrain her hidden potential and raise her to be a guardian of Ionia. But every time I looked at her I couldn&rsquo;t help but wonder whether or not the little girl I desperately tried to save could ever forgive me, and maybe... Just maybe she would ever be able to remember me.\n\nThe one who lost their name&hellip;\n\n_Feel free to leave any feedback or comments! All are appreciated._","replies":[]}
