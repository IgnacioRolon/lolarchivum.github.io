Personal account gifting error!!!","subforum":"Help & Support (OCE)","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey Riot and fellow summoners. \r\n\r\nI need some help pronto for this problem. I don&#039;t know what to do to fix it, as the problem is only linked to this account. I can login to my alternate accounts on this device and still be able to gift, and other devices have the error when I use this account. What basically happens is, I open to the gifting page and it loads (somewhat) but instead of coming up with a list of people I can gift it comes up with &quot;Redirecting you to the BYOD SSL certificate install page&quot; followed by a black client, and when I highlight it, the words &quot;DNS error&quot; followed by a description come up. Can I please get some help as soon as possible for this issue, since it is EXTREMELY annoying, considering I want to give a friend a birthday present through a P&quot;urf&quot;ect surprise. \r\n\r\nThanks for reading, \r\n-Lotus\r\n\r\nLinks: (in case of some error)\r\nhttp://i.imgur.com/mkDWh5U.jpg?1 (byod certificate error)\r\nhttp://i.imgur.com/sLQI9fg.png?1 (black screen + writing)","replies":[{"poster":"HORSE OF FORCE","date":"2015-04-03T11:37:07.211+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"That seems weird.
