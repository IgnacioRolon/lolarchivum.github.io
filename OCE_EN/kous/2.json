Now that more and more Chinese are flooding the OCE server, getting abused in poor English and unable to communicate with teammates is now a common occurrence. Finding 4 non English speaking team mates happens much more than it should. The damage this has done to the server is irreversible. Riot decided to make the decision to bring the Chinese to the OCE server now you are left with a joke of a server.\r\n\r\nI now refuse to play on this server as i cannot stand the amount of toxic games i have to participate in. This game isn&#039;t worth the stress.. it used to be worth the time now its an utter joke.","replies":[]}
