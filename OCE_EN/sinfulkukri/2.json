They've got enough stuff  to do. Repair the client in the startup menu..","replies":[{"poster":"sinfulkukri","date":"2016-07-08T03:00:21.958+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'm sorry, post was made in the heat of the moment.. does repairing it help fix the issue? cause it's like the 1st time it happened in a while.. i was just mad because it was my promo's. I know riot is going all they can tho and good on them.","replies":[{"poster":"Soulless Reaper","date":"2016-07-08T05:45:25.883+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Repairing the client should hopefully fix it. you will lose any custom builds you've made. But it should hopefully fix any problems you've got. In the near Future Riot is releasing their own client which should be absolutely beautiful. It looks fantastic and it's only just hitting the PBE from the Alpha stage.","replies":[]}]}]}]}
