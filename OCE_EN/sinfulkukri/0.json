ITS KILLS TRYN DURING ULT","subforum":"Miscellaneous","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Whilst playing Tryndamere i died a total of 6 times during ult..  when went on cooldown. 2 times i thought maybe because of the 0.5 sec activation delay. but the other 4 of them were 2 secs after the ult as i activated to test it out. This got me to playing a few games with tryn and i noticed it was always Warwick with his  Skirmisher's Sabre ult combo that kills me through ult.. \r\n\r\nPLZ RITO FIX ASAP\r\nTY XD","replies":[{"poster":"Sackboy","date":"2014-12-08T03:22:25.058+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Please don't fix it, it's finally some %%%%ing counterplay to his ult.
