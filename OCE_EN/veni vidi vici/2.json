So all champs would have unknown /random abilities and every single time they hit q,w or e it&#039;ll be a different random ability. You could even maybe put the ability types in groups and have it random from a group.. Like melee champs example: Tryndamere can randomly use a poppy q or a yi heal or a vi q sorta thing. Imagine how unpredictable the game mode would be.. Mages, marksmen and supports... All random abilities from their group/type. If it stays in the groups your item build would still be functional (if you&#039;re building ap you will still get all ap moves.) I believe it&#039;d be a hectic gamemode!!

So, for example, you could pick Blitzcrank and end up with Death Sentence (Thresh's Q) or Dredge Line (Nautilus' Q) instead of Rocket Grab (Blitzcrank's Q) for the duration of the game, rather than a random one of the three every time the ability is used. It allows for far more reliable ability use, which is always ideal.\n\nAnother point, how specifically would we be classifying abilities? Will they be classified under their effects (so like the example above with Blitz, Thresh and Naut) or will it be based on the champions role (Mage, Marksman, Tank, Fighter, Assassin, Support)?","replies":[]},{"poster":"HellsHaven","date":"2015-04-09T06:46:03.166+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"this sounds insane but also champions like {{champion:432}} heavily relies on their set abilities and so therefore this will be extremely chaotic and may cause a lot of raging","replies":[]},{"poster":"Entrako","date":"2015-04-03T12:15:07.861+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Love your idea but i just wont work. It's complicated so i don't want to explain why that deeply. Just think about it, those abilities are sort of ''assigned''  to those champions (not a good word), they would have to re write champs and go into all this technical stuff but the bottom line is it just wont work. Still great idea. <3","replies":[]}]}
