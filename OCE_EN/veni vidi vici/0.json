You all have seen people running away with 100 hp, if a player with full page of AP (which stacks up to +36 AP) combined with a medium range scaling of 60% AP skills (ie Lissandra Q) you dish out 22 more damage per Q compared to another level 29 person on the same champion, who may not have one bit of AP because they brought Gnar instead of runes and decided it's not for them, should the two stand next to each other and facebash with their Q, the one with better rune page will come out on top.","replies":[{"poster":"VENI VIDI VICI","date":"2015-10-09T23:33:50.913+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> There's no difference, consider any female wearing low cut top to show boobs will get more subs on twitch than a random in challenger.
