I used a pair for the first time at PAX Aus this year and i was surprised at how well they worked, i could actually hear almost nothing other than what was coming out of the headphones themselves.\n\nIt doesn't effect the volume levels of the game or their voice coms either, if you look up the technology behind active noise control it's actually pretty interesting.","replies":[{"poster":"VENI VIDI VICI","date":"2015-12-23T06:20:50.795+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hmm I remember back when noise cancelling meant it'd just turn the sound up basically.
