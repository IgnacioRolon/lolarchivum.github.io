If I was vsing MY elo on the other hand.. Anyway yes I&#039;m sad.\n\nTonight I jump on at 10pm and realise I gotta smash 3 wins before 12.. Just missed out. Won one in 20min, next one got smashed.. Then ranked closes at 11:35? \n\nAny thoughts that I&#039;d be able to get the skin being just a game or 2 away from gold? I was almost there but smurfs.. In my belief I deserve it and hadn&#039;t had much time this year to ranked. But if they give it to me alot of people would want it too which I understand.. Just sad. Just missed out. Rip dreams, any chance you could have mercy on my soul?","replies":[{"poster":"Serfige","date":"2015-11-10T14:01:18.377+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":2,"body":"LOL get gatekept son","replies":[]},{"poster":"DragonOfTheVoid","date":"2015-11-10T19:02:18.081+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"if you went to the lowest lv in gold you should of stoped and been that got the skin and got over it","replies":[]}]}
