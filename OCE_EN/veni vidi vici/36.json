It's because every single game you're in a queue full of noobs AND (a big *AND*) you've nerfed some champs to the ground.. I just played as Volibear, his q literally has a 2 second cooldown ALL GAME.. Wtf is that. What's the point of playing Voli if you're constantly kited because you have no potential to catch anything that has a dodge or leap etc. . 2sec cd all game, even if you're fully kited out and then have to wait the 2 secs to press it again to try run away. Let alone charge up your bite or even use your R.. I've lost 8 out of 9 URFS usually because everyone can't hold their own lane. You need to bring a ranked system so people can play with similar skill level. Not have noobs vsing pros. It feels overwhemingly helpless and hopeless the every game yyou have no impact to carry because you have 2 troll duos or anything of the likes. It's a really fun game mode but it's really lost it's magic and I see it because of these 2 reasons.. I've waited all year for this but it's lost its fun. ON TOP OF THIS, it's impossible to not get flamed every game for no reason.. Even if you're having a good game, you'll get spammed as a noob by some shitlord duo who picks champs that only benefit themselves, not team comp..  If I don't pick op champs it's not worth playing cause half of the champs are nerfed to the ground.. I think bring a ranked system.. This was a rushed post but you're welcome for the input.","replies":[]}
