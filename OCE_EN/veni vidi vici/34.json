Sometimes giving help can feel boring and sometimes feels wasted on people. Some people are generally pretty helpful and get no reward for the service they&#039;ve provided.

Wouldn&#039;t want the boards to dry up with just trolls lurking.","replies":[{"poster":"Deep Terror Nami","date":"2015-12-26T18:07:31.502+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Knowing you helped is reward enough for those that truly want to make a difference :3 Giving rewards for it could result in masses of people interfering with each other trying to get it, and distributing false information in the process.\n\nBut that's just my opinion. A ribbon/seal would be nice for those that truly deserve it :P","replies":[{"poster":"VENI VIDI VICI","date":"2015-12-27T05:28:04.654+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"True.
