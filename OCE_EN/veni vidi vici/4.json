Honestly a pain in the ass. Happens to me so many times..","replies":[{"poster":"Elffie","date":"2016-06-20T13:46:06.640+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"its not a bug riot set it that way so that you cant buy some major hp items then undo it for an insta heal. its basically to make every single purchase/play matter and count. it was even in the patch notes this season as to why it was there and why it happens {{sticker:slayer-pantheon-thumbs}}","replies":[{"poster":"VENI VIDI VICI","date":"2016-06-20T19:10:22.443+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Ah nice.

Happens a lot to me, if it was a bug I think it would've been fixed by now.","replies":[{"poster":"Lord Sesshomaru","date":"2016-06-20T23:09:26.601+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Syndra's R has no blue timer on its icon when it is on Cooldown, it has the seconds but it looks like it will come off coo down any second when it really has over a minute to go. Thats a bug and its been going on for months and months and months without being fixed. \nRiot aren't as good at fixing bugs as you might think.","replies":[{"poster":"VENI VIDI VICI","date":"2016-06-22T11:17:24.208+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Also a bug where the shop says you have enough gold to buy a complete item eg. Infinity Edge, when you just bought part of the recipe eg. Pickaxe and have 1300gold when In reality you have like 400 left over.. And ult timers been screwing up lately too.
