I can barely afford any champs other than the cheapest ones. It takes absolutely FOREVER to earn blue essence... I have 2 accounts, one is NEW with 7days worth of game time. Another has 102 days worth of gameplay. I have every single champ with 150k BE on the main account and 1k be on the new account.. Meanwhile only able to afford the 450 champs.. What the hell is the deal with that Riot. Scam artists? Does EA come to mind??","replies":[{"poster":"Nightjar","date":"2018-03-02T04:19:58.133+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"regardless of whether the new system is better or not.\nThe current system feels bad, it feels like we're being ripped off, regardless of whether we really are or not, it feels like it's a rip.\n\nNow onto why it is a ripoff (or at least makes the system less exploitable). Firstly, the average level up chest is worth around 900BE, and milestone chests are worth approx 3000BE. The new system does hold higher value provided you do use the champions shards rather than dusting them, however this has diminishing returns as your collection expands. Assuming you dust everything, the difference is the rate you earn BE/IP is negligible.\n\nSo it does actually help new players who don't give a damn about who they play (which is almost none of them, because new players like to play what they want, and not what you randomly give them, again feels bad).\n\nNow onto players who were trying to fill out the very last of their collection. Maybe some people didn't realise this, but if you filled out the lower cost section of your collection, you could significantly raise the value of your IP. If you owned every 450-3150 IP champion, by buying 3 champion shards, you could raise the value of your IP investment drastically. Firstly, you would roll shards, if you got a good shard, you could use conversion to get a high cost champion at a large discount, in a similar way to the current method, so the new system doesn't have much benefit, but most importantly, if you had 3 ryze shards, you could reroll. This would convert any low rolls on the value of your champion shard, into something far more rewarding (provided you owned all the cheap champions). If you owned all the 450-3150 champions, your 5100 IP investment would return a champion whose average worth would be around 5600. So essentially, by exploiting this, you could get alot more out of IP than you could with BE.\n\nSo long story short, if you look at only the simple BE/IP conversion, it looks fair, though the system feels alot worse than IP did; but if you look at the range of ways you could use IP, technically yes you are actually being ripped off a bit.\n\nBut in the end, its Riot's game, they can do what they want. They can decide to ban you, even if you did absolutely nothing wrong, with no justification because you don't own anything (maybe this will be strike 1 for me, I've always been a nice player but I don't exactly agree with riot's ethics or lack of them), you have no rights, Riot owns these accounts, and if you don't like it, go play Heroes of the Storm because they don't care.","replies":[{"poster":"Dyzon","date":"2018-03-02T08:33:17.889+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yeah I was nearing the end of my collection and would do the re rolling of champion shards of lower value than 4800 or 6300 to unlock the newer champs for cheaper using the method you described. It's a shame now that you can't do it and finishing out my collection may take way longer even though i've got about 15-20 champions to go, because as you said the chance of getting a champion shard for a champion I don't own is way less likely.

Crafting a champion shard into a champion permanent seems like the best way to get new champs cheaply but in doing so you are basically having to get new champions at random, rather than choosing them from the store.","replies":[{"poster":"VENI VIDI VICI","date":"2018-03-01T07:41:44.616+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Exactly grrr...

Win of the day is a very very very small amount compared to champions that cost 6300 BE..\n\nProbably just a money making scheme because people will be forced to use $ for champions instead of in-game rewards. Should just buy a new account with alot of BE already on it for $15 because it will save you a lot more time.","replies":[{"poster":"VENI VIDI VICI","date":"2018-03-01T08:18:41.616+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I guess really it's roughly 4x harder to get champions now..
