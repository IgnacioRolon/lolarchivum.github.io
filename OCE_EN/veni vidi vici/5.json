Being played nons-stop because of her broken ass being the fastest thing since usain bolt with an ability to throw trucks at you. When is this champ being toned down to the point where she doesn't make me feel like giving up on league because of the pleb! Boring ass champ which is broken with little counter isn't fun playing with. It's funny how her kit change was meant to make it so she has to either fully engage or disengage rather than being always safe and risk-free. . I don't see the part where she isn't like that now?? She can throw spears all day long and have no counterplay.. Oh you tried to engage her? She will pull you to her nexus before you catch her.. Lock down doesn't work on her, she just jumps out and heals. There is little threat to the aboriginidalee. \n\nYeah I might be over the top with this post but gosh I am sick to death of this champ being in every game let alone every lcs game. Maokai/rumble/nidalee/lee-sin/ kalista/annie/ zed gosh i am sick of seeing these champs in lcs. I don't even watch the game if more than 2 of these champs are played. Absolutely sick of seeing the same game. It is stale. I think the food at the back of my cupboard is more fresh than half of these matches. Maybe instead of nerfing everything, bring older champs BACK up to speed.. idk anymore. These nerfs are becoming messy that's for sure.","replies":[{"poster":"JasonWazza","date":"2015-03-06T03:47:43.741+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":">with an ability to throw trucks at you.\n\nThat was old Nidalee spears.\n\nNew Nidalee spears are cars.","replies":[]},{"poster":"OJ191","date":"2015-03-07T07:31:10.337+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'm more sick of kat leblanc and zed, being a mid main and all.\n\nOh and xerath's Q cooldown is still pretty cancer but at least he's relatively rare these days.\n\n\nactually nah nidalee can diaf too I just remembered the last time I had to face her mid, her spears were hitting me literally on the other side of minions, she would throw it at me down lane, I would walk to the opposite side of the approaching casters, then I would get magically chunked by magic even though it was a) visually missing (but normal for the broke ass hitboxes it has) and b) having a minion directly between me and it.","replies":[]},{"poster":"BarryButcher","date":"2015-03-06T02:26:19.659+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"She's \"risk-free\" in the same way Akali is \"risk-free\" 1v1, yes there is almost no risk because she can kill you before you can do anything about it.

Decrease the flat damage on the spear, but successive spears on the same target could be increased due to the hunted mark. And to balance it, either decrease the cooldown, or increasing the hunted mark's duration, that way nidalee can't cause game-changing damage without specific, decisive precision and finesse.","replies":[{"poster":"jomoko2012","date":"2015-03-06T08:14:29.655+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Woah someone that actually speaks for both sides and convinces me that his/her points are right.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"JasonWazza","date":"2015-03-06T03:48:34.364+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":">I know you can't nerf the damage, because then Nid would be dropped.
