Seeing Huni abuse this combo in this match https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ysGdl8l-S4 made me pretty dumbfounded by how stupid this is. Homeguards should not be effective past a certain range from the base. They&#039;re for getting out of the base quick- not so a Hecarim (any other fast moving champ) can just teleport in and make the distance of half the map in 1 second!!! If you think it isn&#039;t a problem- watch this game. UOL continuously come back at finatic and then get destroyed just because they didn&#039;t take into consideration that Huni has teleport and can make you out of position in 4.1 seconds (4 seconds to teleport behind them.) Absolute bullcrap Riot wtf.
