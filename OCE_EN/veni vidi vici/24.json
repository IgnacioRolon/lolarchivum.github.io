Make the game sounds more enticing with more variation in sound. For example  a sion when he thuds the ground with his hammer or lucians doubletap/ult.. Turn the bass up??\r\n\r\n\r\nOK, so here I was watching pro plays on youtube and was thinking about how you could make a really cool dragon/beast sound with some base and clicking etc etc make it a crazy raur.. hey.. wouldn&#039;t it be cool if there was a bit of bass (the heavy low vibration sound) in LOL? Imagine there&#039;s an option that you can turn bass up cause I realised most of the sound currently is treble.. Moderate-high sounds. In shooting games proper headphones make the game so much more of an experience. I used to put a silencer on every gun just because my headphones made the beats/thuds sound amazing.. It made my experience that much better.\r\n\r\nImagine having another way to describe how big and powerful say, dragon is? Or baron? Or big tanky champs with huge hammers or marksmend who shoot big guns... A bit of bass would make the game 9.9/10 I think. \r\n\r\nCheers for reading.","replies":[{"poster":"DW GunGale","date":"2015-09-21T11:30:27.519+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Let's fix the issue with Juggernauts before giving them another reason for us to hate them.","replies":[{"poster":"VENI VIDI VICI","date":"2015-09-21T12:06:49.034+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"lmao","replies":[]}]}]}
