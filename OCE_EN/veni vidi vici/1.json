In norms I rarely ever lose 50% chance of winning. Lately it&#039;s been seriously hard to carry games. I&#039;m not sure if I am bad and can&#039;t carry this trash or the team is trash. The other night I wanted one win (not ranked).... I had an 8 loss streak before I could claim the First Win Of The Day Bonus. \r\n\r\nJust now I was just in a game as ww.. It was 12-3 by 12minutes (every lane died every time they were in lane and the jungler had nothing to do with it.) I say nothing and the aatrox who kept feeding riven and the twitch who fed jinx started ganging up on me (basically saying report me and I was so trash and salty and toxic and the worst they&#039;ve ever seen) and were absolute cunts to me.. I DID NOTHING FUCKING WRONG. NORMALLY I DON&#039;T HAVE A PROBLEM WITH NORMS, you know people just play whatever and chill.. I can not win 2 games of blackmarket brawlers.. After 10 games I finally got my first win... THE EVENT IS ALMOST OVER AND I&#039;M STUCK IN UNCARRIABLE TEAMS.. Don&#039;t mean to bitch but fuck this... I&#039;ve had it for over a week.. Just constant wankers","replies":[{"poster":"Zorphiax","date":"2015-08-05T12:41:01.658+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":2,"body":"Salty much\nAltho yes I can feel your pain but then I watched this:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugXC7g3p0JU\nTeamwork OP\nAn older Riot video","replies":[{"poster":"VENI VIDI VICI","date":"2015-08-07T04:52:06.409+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yeah haha people don't realise dis","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"vicelore","date":"2015-08-05T23:14:48.930+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"The new game mode is crap anyhow, Id suggest changing roles..

People that would purposely buy the same minion that you said you would buy or not buy any because they were being royal twats.

Hopefully you find a way to cleanse the salt and rage and play from a refreshing standpoint, getting the 3rd icon before the end of the event.\nI would normally say take a few days off to cure the tilt but if your goal is to get those wins then I think you're just going to have to get a duo or trio or premade and \"get carried\" for the 3rd icon.","replies":[{"poster":"VENI VIDI VICI","date":"2015-08-07T04:48:56.820+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I do a lot..
