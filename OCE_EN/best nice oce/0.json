It poses no problem while playing, but finding games, creating lobbies, champ picks/bans, and changing spells, masteries and runes can sometimes be a problem. I disconnect about 3 times while creating/searching for a game and another 3 in champ select. It wasn&#039;t much of a problem because I was lucky enough to not d/c when it was my turn to pick, until just now. The lobby I was just in, I was first pick. I banned all three champs and picked mine fine. Thirty seconds later the client frosted over (not sure if its a related problem) and closed. The person I was duoing with said it hadn&#039;t crashed, so I figured I&#039;d reload while the game was loading. A moment later he said that it cancelled, and that &quot;Phat Dubz failed to select a champion&quot; which is clearly not the case. I then had to wait a 5 minute timer before searching for a new game.\r\n\r\nThis obviously isn&#039;t my direct fault, and while annoying the issue was tolerable. But now I&#039;ve been penalised 3LP and a 5 minute timer (a small penalty that I&#039;m not fussed about, but it can lead to more severe punishments). SO -- what&#039;s the fix?","replies":[{"poster":"iPunchFatLadies","date":"2015-05-17T05:44:02.875+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Same here! I can't even play with my mates!

Think of it as backwards compatibility. Disabling it would mean that if your computer is only allowed to communicate using IPv6, then it would just have no way of communicating to older devices (including servers that have not enabled IPv6 yet). This problem would actually go unnoticeable for the time being. In fact I'd bet that you wouldn't notice it for at least four more years. But eventually the limitations of remaining with IPv4 will outweigh the benefits of keeping it enabled and hence it'll be removed by most services. They'll probably just say, \"We improved connectivity,\" or something similar to explain it.\n\ntl dr; Disabling it won't have any noticeable effect.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"best nice oce","date":"2015-05-18T03:07:49.260+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'm currently in champ select and haven't had a problem yet since doing this.
