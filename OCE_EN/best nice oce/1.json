Purchasing them only costs 75g, so while there&#039;s no direct effect on gameplay and it&#039;s just a minor visual error, it&#039;s still an error.\r\n\r\nThe two screenshots are of different stages in the game but they still show the problem.","replies":[{"poster":"HORSE OF FORCE","date":"2015-06-11T08:40:05.764+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":">both images fail to load\n\num\n\nAnyway, bug reports go [here](http://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/bug-report). Could just be that they made the upgraded trinket price not upgrade dynamically, like the rest of the items. Maybe it was intentional?","replies":[]}]}
