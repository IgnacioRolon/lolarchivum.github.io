The chances of there only being 1-2 good people on a team is minimal, and being a bot game the skill level needed to win is minimal.\r\nWhat I&#039;m trying to say is, leaverbuster should be more lenient in bot games, removing the afk trigger but keeping the one that happens when you actually leave the game.","replies":[{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2018-11-17T13:47:30.792+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":1,"body":"It *is* more lenient in bots, but what if you're in a game with new players? You're either screwing them over or teaching them that afking is fine, either way not exactly ideal.\n\nWhile the cost to your team is *much* less significant in a bot game, it's still there, and you still made a commitment to that game.","replies":[{"poster":"Yaboidanielkim","date":"2018-11-17T20:55:19.551+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"In what way is it more lenient?

Even if you left for the whole game if you didn't leave games often you wouldn't be hit with a LPQ. It's more lenient in that you have to leave more bot games to trigger LPQ than ranked games or normals.","replies":[{"poster":"Hi Im Stanky","date":"2018-11-19T05:06:57.714+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"what about us people who have no history of leaving before the bugg from patch 8.21?","replies":[{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2018-11-19T08:27:47.012+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You'd have to take that up with player support: https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/requests/new\n\nI'm not aware of any widespread issues that occurred during that time that match your description, and there are multiple ways to end up with DirectX errors so multiple reports don't necessarily mean the issues players are experiencing aren't still local errors.

This bug is wide spread through every region since 8.21 go look yourself there's multiple posts all about the same thing from every region. NA Tarzaned himself tweeted about it a few weeks back saying he's not playing the rest of the season out because of this bug. There's a massive Reddit thread just for this bug and \"possible fixes\" since you guys aren't even acknowledging this as an issue yet. And it's been going for over a month now! Next patch notes say nothing about it. Support has literally offered no help to hundreds of people from across all regions too trying to tell us it's a local error wasting our time basically testing this or that. While we are all hit with unfair 20min qeue timers, some people even just from bot matches like this.\n\n You guys shouldn't even have ranked games available right now with this issue!","replies":[{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2018-11-20T03:01:59.924+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"_I'm not a Rioter_, I'm just a player. I don't have any inside info nor do I have a chain of command to pass this up. I don't follow the reddit page, and not even really NA boards, so all I've seen is 3 or 4 players with an issue that can be caused by any number of things. In my experience if things were so widespread there would be far more posts than that.\n\nDoesn't mean there isn't an issue, that isn't what I said. I said I wasn't aware of any issues matching your description. Support have the means to pass on widespread issues as well, so still your best option is support.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Ing√©nue","date":"2018-11-18T00:53:16.463+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Leaver buster triggers if you frequently leave games.
