He was telling us that we were trash and that he was left to carry. After the game he then sent me multiple requests to be added as a friend. I messaged him and told him to leave me alone, to which he replied &quot;look at you&quot; &quot;you are absolute trash&quot;. I then told him to stop harassing me. His reply was &quot;I just looked at  your ranked scores lmao  your fkn shit, uninstall league for all of us you 12 year old child&quot;. I then told him i would report him for cyber bullying. His next statement was &quot;go for it idfc kmai why the fuck do i care i have a secure vpn that no one can track fk wit&quot;. I then said  &quot;listen bud, you need to stop harrasing others over the internet its just a game&quot;. &quot;lmaoo and your tash, bye before i boot you offline&quot; was his response.\n\nThe moral of the story is, people like this, who threaten to boot you offline and abuse you for playing a game shouldn&#039;t be allowed to play League of Legends, it&#039;s a bad influence for the community and is not needed.

In saying this, I went ahead and removed the summoners name as it violates the [universal boards rules](http://boards.oce.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/announcements/BjArMH2B-boards-universal-rules). \n\nTo deal with players like this, I would encourage taking onboard some of **BarryButchers**'s  suggestions.\n\n>1. Mute - mute players as soon as they give any signs of being abusive. That way, you can ignore them and go about your game in peace. \n2. Report -  [Definitely utilise the end of game reporting feature. Consistent reports are the only way to ensure that a player gets punished.](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752884-Reporting-a-Player)\n3. **why add someone who you know it only doing so to be a prick? **- don't add summoners  that have expressed abusive behaviour! You are in control of your friends list. \n4. people who are habitual toxic do eventually get banned - [We have an instant feedback system in place and its working 24/7 to ensure players that are getting reported are getting punished. ](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/207489286-Instant-Feedback-System-FAQ-)\n\n**As the abuse happened outside of the game,** be sure to send in a support ticket to Riot detailing exactly what happened, and any evidence you may have.\n\nPlease keep in mind that player support is busy and it may take a lil while for them to get back to you (almost always reply within a week). During this time do not lodge multiple tickets or continue adding information to your existing ticket, as it may send your enquiry to the back of the queue.\n\nAlso please keep in mind that Riot are unable to tell you if the player receives punishment due to privacy reasons.","replies":[{"poster":"PrometheusLD","date":"2016-07-30T12:17:31.231+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> Also please keep in mind that Riot are unable to tell you if the player receives punishment due to privacy reasons.\n\nTo quote the Player Behaviour FAQ they stickied on this board:\n\"Reports are used by the Instant Feedback System in the following way:\n...\nFollow-up notifications for players who reported a player who was punished\"\n\nIf they are prepared to tell you when a report results in punishment, the best conclusion one can draw from silence is inaction.

You could be facing 2 - 3 week delays in replies.  \n\n 2. **That information doesn't serve a good purpose.**\n Don't get me wrong, report feedback is really important and we need more of it. But at some point it does become a privacy issue as well.\n\n It's a really great feeling to know that your report helped punish someone, but after that, additional information really doesn't enhance this, and we start to get the possibility for negative effects. The last thing we want to see is players using report information against players who are genuinely trying to reform.\n\n _e.g.\"this draven is about to be perma-banned, let's try fuck with him and see if he'll snap\"_\n\n__*\n\n_Alright, so then what is **Riot** doing about report feedback right now?_\n\n+ Currently on live we have [this notification](http://apollo-na-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/1438974480/banned.png). The idea is solid, but it's outdated and we need a better system IMO. Most people don't really understand how it works/what triggers the notification.\n\n According to **Lyte** a big focus of the new tribunal would be report feedback. I'd imagine this is where they're going to bring in improvements for a report feedback system. They're [working on it](http://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/player-behavior-moderation/mEIlagLk-when-is-the-tribunal-coming-back?comment=0006) as we speak, so should get finished up soon with any luck ;)\n\nI hope this cleared things up!","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"HerpDerpHippo","date":"2016-07-30T05:35:25.000+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I tried to leave a support ticket but it directed me here.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Łæoña","date":"2016-07-31T02:58:08.331+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It happens alot of the time, Don't listen to him; just either mute him or block him and he won't be able to msg you. \n\nBest possible way to go about with this is to mute the player, always instant mute if the summoner is toxic.\nIf u feel a little tilted and still want to game then either watch a funny video ( I personally watch Conan O' Brian which got me off a tilt and won a rank) or listen to some music whilst you play.\n\nIf this happens again just mute and play your best and forget about him.
