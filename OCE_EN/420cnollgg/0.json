Will there be any reimbursement for the countless ranked games I've lost due to DCs","subforum":"Help & Support (OCE)","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"Those who have experienced this issue have no doubt attempted just about every troubleshooting issue riot games and online forums have to offer. The only way to test if the changes you made worked is to start a game and see if you dc or not. I tried several different procedures including turning off my firewall, repairing league (3 times) and uninstalling and reinstalling the game twice. This resulted in plenty of lost games and lost lp, given that there is seemingly no fix. This issue to someone who takes the game quite seriously has been incredibly annoying. Too much time and lp lost for an issue that has nothing to do with me or my connection.","replies":[{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2018-05-30T14:56:32.429+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"If you knew there were issues why were you testing in ranked games? Coop vs AI and Normal games are all run from the same servers and have the same connections as far as ISP issues are concerned so you could have used them. Other players affected also mentioned here on boards that a tracert showed the bad connections even when they weren't bad enough to actively affect a game, so it should have been fairly easy to test without entering a ranked game.\n\nAt any rate, bottom line is that Riot can't refund LP. It messes up a whole lot of stuff on the backend with matchmaking and would result in a way worse time for players than any LP that might have been lost. If you have to be annoyed at any one I think Telstra is the place to take your complaints to given it was their issue. \n\nRiot can't control Telstra anymore than you can. When stuff like this happens Riot can't do anything other than warn players about the issues until x ISP gets their ass in gear and fixes the problem. At best they can divert traffic, but that usually results in higher ping at best, and depending on where the issue is sometimes just isn't possible.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Typhon","date":"2018-05-31T00:34:13.727+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"https://boards.oce.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/help-support-oce/bPfLvjTR-network-issues-telstra","replies":[]}]}
