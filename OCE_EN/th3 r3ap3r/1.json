WTF is with the blind?...she can black your whole screen for 3-5 secs....yet a champ with the same ability &quot;teemo&quot; cant?....it so dumb. She can one vs one basically most champs with FA items..esp other adcs. I know she needed a buff...but wow\r\n\r\nAtleast get rid of the &#039;black out your whole screen shit&quot; for starters...next time im in bot lane (esp as the adc) VS a quinn..i&#039;ll mise aswell play with my monitor turned off...so dumb riot..wow","replies":[{"poster":"Talon12","date":"2016-01-01T15:25:10.947+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"She weaker compared to when she was first done, they legit cut like 50% of her scaling off.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Project Xayah","date":"2015-12-31T04:25:04.146+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I (also?) think they should revert her \"blind\" to pre 5.22, it was far better then (and was actually a blind, ffs Rito).\n\nAs for her passive, it's really not that different in damage compared to pre 5.22, it basically just takes an extra attack to provide full damage. I was always getting near crit level damage from each passive proc pre 5.22, which we had 2 of then, shy only by ~10% (even while using IE, don't ask me how), now though it's ~120-160% (depending on level) for 3 procs.\n\nThe changes to her ult are pretty cr*p anyway though, all it is is move speed and you can't even use it as an escape. You may as well just play Rammus if you want MS.\n\nWhen you think about it, pretty much the only thing that actually got buffed was the Heightened Senses active, which reveals a much larger area (pure utility and not even that useful for a decent player).\n\nThe reason she's doing well at the moment has nothing to do with how \"OP\" she is, she's actually not that much better than pre 5.22 (I'd say worse). It's a combination of the pre-season changes (specifically items and masteries), the fact that no one knows how to deal with her (and that no one knew how to deal with her before, though not nearly as much) and so many people playing her because everyone thinks she's OP, even though she isn't. Probably also to do with the fact that she got a rework and everyone thinks that means she's OP all of a sudden. Give it a few months and she'll be considered trash tier again, unless Rito ruin her again for the sheer fun of it.","replies":[{"poster":"Talon12","date":"2016-01-01T15:26:06.299+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"its 15-50 + 115%-150%\n\nand if you get 40% cdr on her, she can actually become quite strong, as your e and q can be put together into a perma combo, where you e aa q aa wait for blind to finish/nearly finish then rinse and repeat.\n\nI also rather her q now than old blind, it makes it much harder for everything to kill you, sure if you let a melee on you, they can kill you in it, but thats what e is for, get out of their range while they are blinded to get free damage.\n\nDo not underestimate the quinn combo damage from, reaaqaa, with a little thunderlord in there its even more. Although i do agree she is lacking slightly in something, can't quite put my finger on it, but its something to do with a nerf to her combo i think.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"King Crow","date":"2016-01-01T12:26:33.395+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"She has a lot of counters.
