Seriously what is wrong with RIOT these days you guys do nothing to stop the true toxicity in games and then you do stuff like this when I&#039;m clearly barely toxic when compared to the bulk of community.

Newer accounts have a lower tolerance for negative/toxic behaviour, due to how easy it is to level up and create new accounts. This prevents people who were recently banned on a different account from simply leveling up their account to 30 and repeating their behaviour. Additionally, this helps alleviate some of the toxic behaviour that new players may be imposed to. By repeatedly asking your team to ff and saying that it's over, you create a negative environment and say things like \"im down to not play\" and \"im done\". If you wish to create a new account again, I highly recommend reviewing your behaviour and working to improve it moving forward.","replies":[]},{"poster":"PurpIe","date":"2017-10-24T09:08:33.855+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You kept saying 'just ff' something i'd insta report for.

It seems VERY likely that you do this stuff regularly.  You play the game till it's over (barring internet failure, which is painful for everyone concerned).\n\nYou rage, you call your team idiots, you threaten to AFK (which you may well have done, the chat doesn't show this), and I very much doubt it's just this game, it is usually a long history  of the same sort of thing, (except where extremes of abuse occur).  Apparently you thought your team believed you were inting, you may well have been, and riot may have thought so to.  Inting is quite frankly as bad as abusive chat and certainly banworthy.\n\nHard to say why you were banned without a full view of the games, but there seems to be many possibilities.","replies":[]}]}
