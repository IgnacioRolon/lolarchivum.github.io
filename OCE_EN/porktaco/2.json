I&#039;m not even gonna begin with all the buggy issues in your game. How about how come you can get banned for barely any toxicity in game. Yet Tyler1 can have his ban taken back and account given back to him when he&#039;s 100x more toxic than your average player who gets banned. And then your own staff will say things like they &quot;hope he dies from a drug overdose&quot; and stuff but oh they&#039;re still allowed to work within your fantastic establishment. Your prices on everything in store are absolutely rip off you&#039;re all money hungry demons now. Then there&#039;s the que timers if you decide to skip a game that someone was obviously going to troll in. Or the fact I can join a lobby and have it bug out completely that I cannot see nor select any champions within said lobby. Oh and then I&#039;m stuck waiting 15 mins before I can join any other lobbies. Seriously what is wrong with you people that you decide to make EVERYTHING as annoying and stupid as possible? You guys do legit NOTHING to people who troll feed and ruin matches and overall experience and fun for everyone else in that match. But OMG someone in that match says that person is trash and it happens more than once cus lets face it almost happens every match nowadays and then that person is banned for two weeks for freely expressing that this troll is ruining the fun for everyone else. RIOT please fix up your own tragedy that is what you have become!","replies":[{"poster":"Mozzie25","date":"2017-10-11T05:56:17.417+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I don't agree with unbanning Tyler1 but get your facts right. They aren't giving him his account back. They are just no longer actively banning every single account he tries to play on or using a ip ban.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Fitzky","date":"2017-10-11T04:01:48.538+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Just gonna put it out there, Tyler1 is not the person he used to be, he has completely changed as a person and is now reformed. I use to hate him too, but now he is a really cool and entertaining streamer. Also the Rioter who trash talked him was actually fired and is no longer working with Riot.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Akkordian Zoeve","date":"2017-10-11T00:51:36.531+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Agreed!\n\nYes, I am much less toxic than I used to be, but that had nothing to do with repentance after my chat bans, but rather the fact they reworked my champion and I love her so much I don't want to lose what I have ❤ ❤ ❤ ❤ ❤ ❤ ❤ ❤ ❤ ❤ ❤","replies":[]}]}
