When someone is toxic in chat you can easily mute them and the problem is solved, when someone feeds or goes afk that is something that is out of your power, you can't do anything about it and the actual game itself is affected. So why does someone get punished immediately after a game of swearing in chat but people who go afk or feed in a game get 2-3 chances before a punishment is given? Why can people get PERMENANTLY BANNED from the game for doing something that is easily solvable by the rest of the players on your team DURING the game, but players who continue to leave the game and force people into an unfair 4v5 will just keep getting 20 minute leave busters. I've also seen on countless occasions of people running it down mid and saying \"I've been doing this for years and never been punished\", because they've never been toxic in chat. \n\nRiot says the in-game chat isn't important to the game but as soon as something goes down in it suddenly its the most serious offense you can commit while playing the game.","replies":[{"poster":"PorkTaco","date":"2017-10-21T10:58:15.392+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"This is exactly correct, they are ruining the game and community completely and now I am perma banned for the odd occasion saying \"stfu\" to people who are actually flaming or the odd \"wtf\" over trolls","replies":[]}]}]}
