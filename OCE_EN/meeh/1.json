One scary scary day, as the skinny asian boy tried to play League, a strange letter popped up! From the Devil himself saying \"Unspecified error occurred. Please check the logs for more information.\" Scared and unsure what to do, he screamed in terror at the top of his lungs just like Justin Bieber singing 'Baby'! Afraid that he would never be able to play LoL again. Till this day, the boy hasn't been able to play a league game. #ineedhelp Seriously... i...need...help. NO LEAGUE = NO LIFE.

I play on the Mac, and a few other Mac users seem to be experiencing it as well. Tried a lot of the fixes posted on a few forums, but none have worked thus far.

What I can tell you is that many people are also getting this issue, so waiting it out might be the best. If you really want to do something though, you can try setting your DNS manually. Ask if you need instructions.","replies":[{"poster":"MeeH","date":"2015-01-11T08:53:43.582+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Can you tell me how to fix it besides re-downloading the game again if that's possible. I can't be stuff re-downloading it and also that people have been saying that re-installing the game doesn't work soo i not too sure :/","replies":[{"poster":"HORSE OF FORCE","date":"2015-01-11T10:37:55.513+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"If you're on a Mac, then that's most likely. No one I know who's on a Mac been able to download the installer.\n\nI'm not certain on a fix that will work for everyone, but manually setting your DNS might get you some results. To do so, go into Control Panel>Network And Internet>Network And Sharing Center>Change adapter settings. Go into the box list and scroll down to Internet Protocol 4 (that's not it exact name but it's right next to the same one but version 6). Select it (leave it checked) and go into properties. Set your DNS to manually use 4.4.4.4 for primary and 4.4.8.8 for alternative.\n\nWe can try other things if that doesn't work.\n\nBest of luck.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Zhaoyang1225","date":"2015-01-10T14:11:14.513+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Same thing happens to me","replies":[]}]}
