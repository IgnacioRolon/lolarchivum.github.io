People don't play when they know they're gonna lag. People just get into game and find themselves lagging. \r\nSo why? Why do people say that?\r\n\r\nJust recently in one of my games, my Yasuo when 4/2/0 early, and was doing really well. Then he started lagging too much, so he went AFK. At the end of the game, my Ashe said to report him. So, I told her that he had 1k+ ping, so there's no way he could have played properly. \r\n\r\nHer response? \"so shouldnt have joined the game\".\r\n\r\nI just don't understand it. People don't play the game and know \"I'm gonna lag exactly 6 minutes into the game. I'm gonna play because I want to lag\", so why speak about people lagging like that?\r\n\r\nNow, this isn't even a rare occurrence. This happens all the time. \r\n\r\nPlease reply with your thoughts on the matter. Should the lagger not play the game because they somehow know that they're going to lag halfway through? Or, should the playerbase stop saying what they say to laggers?","replies":[{"poster":"Acinicus","date":"2019-10-01T15:34:38.278+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"If you have a shit internet if ur prone to lag play a normal first or Aram or something to see if ur lagging at that point if u can play out a game and not lag fine but a lot of people know they are lagging and play anyway.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Broken Scripts","date":"2019-09-21T23:51:58.895+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":">so he went AFK.\n\nBoom, easy report for AFKing.","replies":[{"poster":"Begging to Lose","date":"2019-09-22T01:20:41.642+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"That isn't the focus of the post.

Also, most players who AFK from lag AFK because it has a better result than what's essentially running it down...\n\nWith that said, talking about the whether or not someone deserves an AFK report isn't the point of this post. It's about whether or not someone should be told that they shouldn't have played the game (though you did address this in your other reply).","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"JasonWazza","date":"2019-09-21T08:05:59.147+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"As for my actual thoughts on the matter it's this, The issue isn't the people who lag out one in a 1000 games, it's the fact that a lot of these people are lagging 1 in 2 or 1 in 3 games, and ruin the experience for everyone, hell some of the friends i play with complain about the same issues, and that's where i can see the justification of the saying \"then you shouldn't play\"\n\nBut for most of my friends, i also don't blame them for the lag, i know better, Australian internet sucks and it's the ISP's fault, not the player, but that doesn't magically make it ok to leave a game however, these friends of mine still play the game out, which is a fuck ton better then the player you talked about who left, and that's where i won't give forgiveness to someone regardless of any circumstance.","replies":[]}]}
