If you got rid of that, Rito would have to remove some of his strength to make up for it.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Jink","date":"2015-06-15T12:51:33.298+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Please buff my ten thousand range dashing soldier AOE slow ability plus AOE damage with remnant soldier on location for flash knockup into wall lol nty.","replies":[]}]}
