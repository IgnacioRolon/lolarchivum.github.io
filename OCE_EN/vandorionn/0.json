However, in the last few weeks and since the pre-season started, something has been happening with the teams I am being put with that is just getting out of hand. For instance, being placed in teams with multiple players who are either playing their first ranked game or sub 10th ranked game, being placed in a team of people in bronze 3-5, against others in high silver/low gold, consistently having someone afk or troll. I know the latter is not something that you can predict, but surely people who do this all the time would have such a low MMR/ban rate that they would not be in my games as frequently as they are. For the first time since I started playing in Season 2, I have felt like I just don&#039;t want to play this game anymore simply because of the teams I have been put into through the match making process.\r\n\r\nHas something been changed with the pre-season? It sure feels like it. I just came from a 7 game lose streak where I had either one or more players on my team that were way too under ranked for the game and so fed hard in the first 5 mins (it&#039;s amazing how many times someone can die in 5 mins)(, or afkers/trolls. This has consistently been happening over the last few weeks since I have been playing the pre-season and honestly, it is just unacceptable. How am I ending up so frequently, on the lower end of these teams... surely one of these times I should be getting at least one person on my team who is doing something useful.","replies":[{"poster":"BlitzForever","date":"2015-12-20T20:37:47.371+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I have no idea why you are blaming your team when your playing like this........\n\nhttp://imgur.com/WbDhbZK\n\nThis is also why you have a 7 loss streak :/","replies":[{"poster":"CHEESYLEEKS","date":"2015-12-22T09:57:32.819+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Shrekt","replies":[]},{"poster":"Vandorionn","date":"2015-12-20T21:51:46.043+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"If you actually did your research on what you just linked, you would have clicked on those and realised that those aren't actually my account.","replies":[]}]}]}
