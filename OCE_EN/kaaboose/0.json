ITEM SETS\nIf there is a way to set these up with the new client I can&#039;t find it. I love being able to create custom item sets for my favorite champions and having to revert to the old client to do so is a pain.\n\n2. STEAM LINK\nI doubt many will care about this one but the new client does not work with Steam Link. I have to hot foot it back to the pc until the champ select screen then go back to the lounge room. I know this won&#039;t effect a lot of people much but it&#039;s problematic to me.\n\n3. WAIT DISPLAY TIMES\nIn ranked with the old client it would tell you if the roll you have selected would result in a longer or shorter wait time. The new one does not and I found that a handy bit of information.\n\nIn conclusion I love the new client but if I want to make or edit an Item set or play with steam link I need to revert to the old client. Would really like to see these fixed/implemented before the final release.","replies":[{"poster":"Corehog","date":"2016-12-22T22:22:18.871+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Riot have said that they will not be bring back item sets as a rather small minority of people use them.\n\n[Maraudaur's Comment](http://boards.oce.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/alpha-client/qxEpENYl-wheres-the-item-sets)\n\n[Riot's official feature list](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/230175788-Updated-Client-Open-Beta-FAQ#h2q1)\n\n\nHope this helps :)","replies":[]},{"poster":"Kaaboose","date":"2016-12-20T21:31:39.375+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Since the Christmas client went live I can now run the new client through steam link!
