The laners blame the Jungler for being behind or getting ganked when they&#039;re to far pushed in lane. Team mates saying stuff like &quot;jg didn&#039;t gank me gg&quot;. It&#039;s something I absolutely despise about this game. I also have no idea how a game can make people so angry and annoyed just by playing it.

I never ask or pester the jg asking for ganks, I'll ping opposing laner when they're low and I know they don't have flash. \n\n When I get ganked and I'm over extending I can't really blame anyone but it would be nice to have a counter gank especially when it's happening constantly. What I really can't stand is Junglers @ my  elo won't gank when they see enemy over extending they leave me getting pushed under tower and won't help. It's worse when you get tower dived by the jungler and mid and they're both getting away with under 200hp and the jgl just completely ignores it and calls you a feeder later and tells you to stop dying... \nSilver 1.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Mozzie25","date":"2018-04-24T02:30:36.743+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Honestly it is bull shit to blame the jungler. But at the same time a jungler can have a massive effect on the match. So when yours has none and spends 20 mins farming it can be infuriating.\n\nAs a top laner it took me a while but I have gotten use to being on an island. If I get a gank from my jungler awesome. If I don’t that’s completely fine. But when your getting camped by the enemy jungler and yours is failing to do anything at all, it can be pretty rage inducing. \n\nHonestly I think the reason they attract rage is that there absense is more notable. If your bot dies a couple of times it’s a problem that will have to be dealt with. But you can probably lane safely for a while. If you jng dies a couple of times and now you have a lee sin preventing you from moving up to farm under penalty of death that’s a bit more noticeable. \n\nThe effectiveness or lack there of is also much more obvious. If you get ganked top a couple of times and die but your jng fucks up his ganks bot and doesn’t get anything it’s a pretty big sign something has gone wrong. \n\nAt the same time there’s different expectations of junglers to laners. As a laner if you exit lane even with no deaths or kills that’s ok. If you as a jungler fail to secure any assists or kills that’a viewed negatively as your supposed to be making things happen.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Project Xayah","date":"2018-04-24T00:58:21.998+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> Why is it teams use their Junglers as a scapegoat?\n\nQuite imply, it's easy for them to blame the one person on the team who isn't laning, particularly when that person has taken on a position that is responsible for assisting all their teammates during the laning phase. They find it easier to just blame the person who wasn't there, than to take responsibility for their own actions and accept they did something stupid. They think they're gods, and that everyone else is dragging them down, when really they're just sh!t.\n\n> My thoughts are is it possible for this game to not be toxic at all?\n\nI'd say that's a definite no. Not even considering that LoL is likely within it's last few years of viable play, it's just how people are to be toxic. You see it all the time in society. When it comes down to it, there is not a single person who has ever been completely non-toxic. Everyone has their flaws, but some are better at controlling them. When it comes down to it, you also need to consider that this is the internet, which provides people with an astounding amount of anonymity, which just makes it easier to be absolute d!cks to others, since they don't have to deal with the consequences as they would IRL.\n\nBottom line, nothing will ever be free of toxicity, the best we can do is strive for something near that.","replies":[{"poster":"Nightjar","date":"2018-04-24T01:56:39.045+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"when the support has ganked top more than the jungler, I feel I have a right to complain. Also support roams have a anecdotal 100% (n=9) chance to cause Silver Yasou's to disconnect within the minute thereafter, it's very funny.\n\nAs a support, I don't expect junglers to come and win the lane, I'm confident I can do that alone; but if you aren't putting pressure bot for early dragons, and mid is difficult to gank, then I expect you to at least help out our toplaner. It's the longest lane, it's a lane where vision control is very stable, and it can snowball very hard. If you don't have a kill, assist, or at least blew a few flash cooldowns, you're just deadweight.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Oriphix","date":"2018-04-24T00:57:20.985+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Well you can sort of understand that the jg is meant to snowball lane.\nHowever I find that anyone can just roam and help lanes out.
