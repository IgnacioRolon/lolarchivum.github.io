I was playing on a cool 120-130 ping and was having a blast. Oce is awesome! Only downside was i was placed 3 divisions lower than where i was on NA, but thats ok i&#039;ll just climb back up. \r\nSince one of the recent patches (I believe 5.18?) i started getting more and more games with 222 ping. Solid, unwavering 222 ping. I don&#039;t have skype, curse, google chrome, itunes or ANYTHING open. Its really frustrating me and i know its not just me with this problem. One of my friends who lives close by to me is having this problem as well. My hopes of returning to silver after being shoved back to bronze because i moves server look ever less likely if this ping doesn&#039;t improve.\r\n\r\nSpecs &amp; Stuff:\r\nISP: PCCW (Netvigator)\r\nWhat im using: Macbook Pro Retina 15-inch, Mid 2014.\r\nProcessor: 2.2GHz Intel Core i7\r\nMemory: 16GB 1600 MHz DDR3\r\nGraphics: Intel Iris Pro 1536 MB\r\nYes, i am wired directly by ethernet\r\nYes, my connection to other things such as youtube and other online games is unchanged.\r\nYes, im bloody frustrated about how much lp i&#039;ve lost from this screwed up 222 ping. Its like a nightmare.\r\n\r\nI hope someone has a solution, or something i can do to help my ISP fix the problem/settings i can change to fix the problem. Thanks in advance guys!\r\n\r\n--Silver Scrub (Who ironically is in Bronze 1) {{item:3070}}","replies":[{"poster":"Mindstar","date":"2015-10-08T00:10:38.536+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hi there,\n\nSorry to hear about your ping issues.  Your best bet will be to run a trace route to 103.240.227.1 and see what path the traffic takes.  It will help understand how data gets from you to your isp, through the internet to Riot's Sydney datacentre (where the OCE game servers live).\n\nFor context - connections from Hong Kong to Sydney can take a [lot of different paths](http://submarine-cable-map-2014.telegeography.com/), and this is largely influenced by how your ISP (or an ISP in between yours & Riot) wants to route traffic on any given day.  If it is 220ms, I'd expect it isn't going via the shortest possible path, but taking the long way around.\n\nLet me know how you go with the trace route.\n\nCheers,\nMindstar","replies":[{"poster":"Mindstar","date":"2015-10-08T01:47:24.312+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Per the Cable map above, I've just found out that the \"SEA-ME-WE3\" cable is cut, and that is causing traffic throughout southeast asia to take different, less optimal paths.  It can take a few weeks for undersea cables to be fixed though, since it requires to send a cable repair ship out to the broken section.\n\nOnce that is fixed, things *should* stabilise and return to normal.\n\ncheers\nMindstar","replies":[{"poster":"Silver Scrub","date":"2015-10-08T22:31:47.584+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Cheers, mate. Thanks for clearing the situation for me. Do you know where to see if the cable is back to normal again? So i know when its safe to play league of legends again. Hopefully in time so i can get back to silver before november haha.\n ","replies":[{"poster":"Coldie","date":"2015-10-10T04:04:30.509+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"On September 15, 2015 the cable was again cut at segment 3.3 causing significant disruption to services from Australia to Singapore. Service disruptions caused particular impact for Apple customers due to the release of the iPhone 6, iOS9 and OSX just prior to the cable cut. Apples services were reported as being crippled for Telstra customers but the impact was noticeable for all other Australian ISP's. [16]** This disruption is expected to be repaired sometime after Mid October 2015.** [17] This is the third time that the cable has been cut in this segment in just over 2 and a half years.\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SEA-ME-WE_3","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Desha","date":"2016-07-06T11:23:17.992+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"i'm on 226ping any help? and im from Hong Kong.","replies":[]}]}
