This is what I got;\r\n\r\n\r\nBundles\r\nWe now have flexible cost bundles that automatically adjust their price based on the content you already own. Bundles have a minimum cost, but pricing is otherwise flexible. Although we are able to refund Champion Release Bundles, we will not refund larger bundles with flexible cost.\r\n\r\nFrom what I understand the bundle I bought was a Champion Release bundle, yet I&#039;m not able to refund it? Is there something I am doing wrong, or was it not considered a champion release bundle?","replies":[{"poster":"HORSE OF FORCE","date":"2015-03-28T00:51:50.772+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It's entirely possible that they just didn't label it right in coded language.
