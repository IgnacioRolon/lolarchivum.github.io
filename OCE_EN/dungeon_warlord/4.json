All I have been hearing is how the Chiefs are by far the standout team in the region,  I really enjoyed seeing Legacy not only match it with the Chiefs in the first game, but then come out even stronger in the second game to take the series 2-0 with a dominating performance.\r\n\r\nWell Done Legacy - Keep it up!\r\n\r\nps. {{champion:427}}  Rocks or is it &quot;gottcha&quot;","replies":[{"poster":"belquin","date":"2017-03-07T00:29:35.182+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It was such an exciting game - we will have to see if the added exposure to playing live games will help Legacy continue to perform like that throughout the finals gauntlet! \n\nChiefs also have a habit of firing up and playing even harder when they are behind, so it's going to be hell exciting!","replies":[]},{"poster":"Lelouch","date":"2017-03-06T08:28:22.591+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"i dont watch opl at all but decided to watch those 2 games, both phenomenal teams. \n\nTally outshined Swipper and Legacy botlane looked absolutely amazing even against the Chiefs bot. Claire's laning phase is solid, he is able to go toe to toe with Swiffer.\n \nIt was really fun to watch the 2 best teams perform, you could tell they are a cut above the rest, it's gonna be exciting when they vs each other again. \n\nProps to legacy, they made me a fan in those games but dont discount chiefs either im sure they will work harder and improve for future battles.","replies":[]}]}
