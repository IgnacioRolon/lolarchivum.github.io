Most of the Chiefs players are at around this figure.  \r\n\r\nIt falls fairly rapidly from there. Top 10 we get down to around  $7,000. Top 20 we are down to  around $2,300. \r\n\r\n37 people have managed to earn over $1,000, and only 67 people have earned anything at all. \r\n\r\n\r\nI am running a 1v1 tournament on the weekend that has a $10 prize, and if the winner is not from the list(follow link) they will be just behind the person at 67 who has earned $20 for a tournament.\r\n\r\nSeeing as it is not easy to earn money in this region playing League of Legends (at least according to the statistics I was able to find), I don&#039;t quite understand the lack of interest in the tournament series I have started. Digital Puppet Masters.\r\n\r\nSo far I have 3 people registered for the 1v1 tournament on in 2 days, and not a single entry into  the team tournament which has the first 4 dates open for registration (has been open for over a week) and carries a $100 prize for each round.\r\n\r\nI am offering $10 this weekend for a 1v1 tournament which is free to enter. I suppose I should be grateful I haven&#039;t been swamped, as this will be my first run and a means for me to gain experience in hosting tournaments, which will help things go smoother for the bigger tournaments I have planned for the future.\r\n\r\nI know $100 is not much of a prize, but it is something, and can add to somebody&#039;s earnings as a League of Legends player in the region. \r\n\r\nFaker (not surprisingly) is the top earning League of Legend player in the world with around 900,000 in earning to date.\r\n\r\nI do have plans to create bigger prize pools for my tournaments in the future, but I will need the  support of the community in order to attract sponsors and create revenue. At this stage all prize money is coming from  my own pocket.\r\n\r\nSo please get behind this project and participate, the better the numbers the more advertisers I can attract and the bigger the prize pools can be in the future.\r\n\r\nhttps://battlefy.com/digital-puppet-masters","replies":[]}
