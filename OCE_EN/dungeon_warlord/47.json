The Chiefs don&#039;t seem to like dealing with the 4-1 split push strategy too much, as their strength is in grouping well and team fighting, so if Flaresz has a good day and if this tactic is employed and executed well, this might just upset the Chiefs.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, Chief are a good team, and after coming off a loss will be right on there game this week(as all good teams are), so it will be tough for SIN to cause the upset against such quality opposition with such a focus on returning to winning ways.\r\n\r\nMy tip: Chiefs 2-0.","replies":[]}
