My budget for this game is as follows, For each division I gain I spend $100 on Riot Points ($100 when I started before being ranked, then $100 when I was ranked). I am still waiting to get to silver and spend my next $100, and have been for 2 years. This means by suppressing my lp and keeping me in b5 Riot are actually costing themselves income.\r\n\r\nThere are a few factors as to why i stay in b5, but by far the main reason is my mmr stuffing up my lp gains for a win.\r\n\r\nFor a company that proclaimed to create a game by gamers for gamers, they have forgotten one of the main factors that make a successful computer game. (Lower levels are easy to get out of and they progressively get harder the more you advance.) This is just good game design.\r\n\r\nAnyway, this is my suggestion, just as experiment suspend all lp penalties due to mmr for all player Gold and below on the Oceanic Server(a smaller  area with enough players to get some good feedback) and see if the ranking system improves or falls in a heap.\r\n\r\nWhat do you think?","replies":[{"poster":"fattyhotdogs","date":"2016-07-15T00:54:33.686+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You don't really understand the whole system.

I actually spend most of my time doing something with League Of Legends, whether it be playing games, watching games, drawing the champions as a hobby. \n\nI may be b5 but I also have a Bachelor Of Technology(Computer Studies) and have been in a sense studying this game for over 3 years.\n\nThere are lots of problems with the game atm, too much damage/burst, dynamic q has its problems, they have actual competition from other Computer Games, the mmr/lp thing is just one of many. \n\nCan I ask why i would study a system that in my opinion is not working very well, understanding it is not going to make it work any better. As I suggested, why not try a different system and see what happens in a smaller server environment?\n\nLike what is Riot afraid of, getting more that 200 people to watch the OCE League? Getting people to want to play the game again?Losing money to the unethical practice of Boosting(unsportsmanlike, see other posts)? Still haven't heard Riots official stance on this practice?\n\nWhat have they got to lose really?\n\n","replies":[{"poster":"fattyhotdogs","date":"2016-07-15T03:21:31.711+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"How the fuck can you say something isn't working if you don't know how it works?","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"JasonWazza","date":"2016-07-15T04:58:37.644+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":">This means by suppressing my lp and keeping me in b5 Riot are actually costing themselves income.\n\nOh no, $100 means so much to a company that probably earns 100s' of thousands+ from a single skin release.\n\n>Lower levels are easy to get out of and they progressively get harder the more you advance.\n\nYep, that is done, Level 1 is easy, Level 30 is hard, the ranked system isn't level's, it's ELO.\n\n>Anyway, this is my suggestion, just as experiment suspend all lp penalties due to mmr for all player Gold and below on the Oceanic Server(a smaller area with enough players to get some good feedback) and see if the ranking system improves or falls in a heap.\n\nThe system will just be irrelevant if this is done, fact is you have shown to the system, that you don't deserve to even be in bronze 5, but against the system's best judgement, there is no wood division to put you in.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Knuuckles","date":"2016-07-15T04:19:40.395+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The system is fine, if you don't have a win rate above 50% you don't deserve to climb","replies":[]}]}
