I played for 2 years on the Garena server and do not wish to start the &#039;grind&#039; all over again due to University commitments. Any inputs or insights will be greatly appreciated. IIRC, there was such a transfer during 2013-2014.\n\nThank You\n\nYours Sincerely,\nA","replies":[{"poster":"Skiepher01","date":"2015-06-08T11:05:15.473+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You actually cant since Garena has their own servers for League of Legends.

How does this logic apply?\n\nEdit: Just did a bit of research. Apparently Garena is a private company that have agreements with companies such as Riot Games to host their games on their servers. Effectively, what you said is exactly true, in that only very specific time frames will allow you to transfer your account from Garena onto any other region. Usually, you just buy the transfer from the store, and that is what I was thinking about. Sorry for the confusion.","replies":[]}]}]}
