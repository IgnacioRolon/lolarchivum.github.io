The skill differential in Bronze is big, and players are *very* inconsistent, so it makes it difficult to climb unless you are significantly better than the rank you have. Fresh account typically get placed in the B2-S4 range, but if you drop now (lack of experience, exposure, consistency. You've only been playing a very short time after all) then it will certainly make it harder to climb next season when you get placed lower than your end of season rank.\n\nClash doesn't have to be super srs, it depends largely on what you and your team expect from it, and as a team you can come to that agreement, but in ranked (esp solo/duo) the expectations are a little different, so while you might be happy to be placed for the sake of clash, you might not want to be placed for the sake of ranked.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2018-05-29T03:17:43.978+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"For the record you do have to have done at least your placements (in SR) to play clash. I don't know if you can even join a team on an unranked account tbh.","replies":[]}]}
