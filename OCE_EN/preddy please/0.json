Clown Bard perhaps??","subforum":"Miscellaneous","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Hey guys recent skin ideas have been fantastic but can we have a new skin for Bard. \r\nI understand it&rsquo;s for popularity reasons that champions get played more often then others, therefore they receive more skin updates. But would it be fair to say they remain popular because they keep receiving new skins, promting people to keep playing them.\r\nI really thought a Dark Star Bard would&rsquo;ve been created when you guys went 100 on making heaps of Dark Star skins. Unfortunately he missed out.\r\n\r\nI think a clown Bard would be awesome. Running around collecting Ballons and throwing ballons at summoners. (Maybe revive surprise party, Bard style?)","replies":[{"poster":"Sn4ke","date":"2018-01-12T06:54:13.842+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Sounds like a pretty good idea, like maybe not a clown but something more like one of fiddlesticks skins but a clown skin would come out around halloween","replies":[]},{"poster":"Broken Scripts","date":"2018-01-10T22:50:45.836+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Does anyone even play Bard?
