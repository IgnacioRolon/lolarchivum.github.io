I normally would say they dont stand a chance but they give me hope for OPL for the first time in years.\r\nEven if they lose we still get 2 more shots at Gigabytes with Legacy and Dire Wolves...\r\n\r\nRegardless of the results  Sin have done OPL super proud and I cant believe I would ever say this but &quot;GO SIN!!! GO!!!&quot;\r\n\r\nWhat are your thoughts\r\n\r\nOomf","replies":[{"poster":"Maraudaur","date":"2017-07-05T10:13:39.970+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"SIN WAS AMAZING GAME 2. That was one of the most intense games I've watched all year. WOOO #GOCE Love when there are international tournaments.","replies":[{"poster":"Oomf","date":"2017-07-05T12:41:58.556+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Heart breaking lose and I know haters are always going to hate and say OPL sucks but think about this\n\nGigabyte Marines are one of the top teams in the world.. and top team at Rift Rivals\nin Group stage on GBM beat us we won the other 2 games\n\nAlso think about this...    Sin our number #5 team (3rd last season thanks to a good gauntlet but they didnt rank 3rd before play offs) beat there number 3 and #2\n\nSo you could say GPL only have Gigabyte Marines...   and thats it.. OPL beats the rest of there league...\n\nSo Overall OPL did well...  sure we finish 3rd but to lose to GBM is like losing to SKT...  theres no shame losing to a team that should win anyway\n\nCongrats to the OPL teams... \n\nI think the shake up to OPL has created a stronger league for us..  no longer cheifs cheifs cheifs (and I am a cheif fan)   Better compition creates better teams and OPL are defiantely no longer the easy beat region...   will we make worlds this year...  probably not but next year at the rate of improvement we are showing I recon we can do a lot better still and could be our year","replies":[{"poster":"Maraudaur","date":"2017-07-06T00:38:55.485+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Definitely agree, always heart breaking as a huge fan to see OCE get knocked out. But you're spot on about Gigabyte Marines, they are world class team, its no shame to lose to a team like that, and the results show us that while GPL has 1 top tier team over the quality of OPL is better.\n\nExcited to see the continued growth and improvement of our scene and more international tournaments!","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"LAKIGR","date":"2017-07-05T12:38:23.053+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"What a shame legacy and dire wolves let us down","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Jason","date":"2017-07-05T15:24:01.333+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"SIN's whole thing right now is that they are a force of pure disruption to the local Esports scene.\n\nLast split pulling some amazing wins vs LGC and CHF in the groups\n\nThen playing 15 competitive games in 3 days, besting AV and CHF, as well as taking LGC to a nail biting game 5\n\nAnd again now, against all odds, taking on almost an entire foreign region and only losing to the best of the best, who then wiped our entire region.\n\nCombine this with their \"When things get messy, we can out-mess anyone\" play style\n\nand SIN are the true DEFINITION of what a Wildcard is, and what they can do.","replies":[]}]}
