After my league of legends finished downloading i tried to download the SIU program again but now i cant open it because it is missing a file called lolviewer.exe .\r\nWhenever i go into the zip to extract the lolviewer.exe it does nothing and now i cannot use the program because of a constant error that im getting being told i do not have the lolviewer.exe file. Does anyone have a solution to this problem?
