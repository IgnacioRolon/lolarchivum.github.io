People have no balls to learn the game, they just wanna rush in and look cool. Plus accounts are so cheap to buy. Even NEACE recommends skipping level 30, so why wouldn't we?\n\n[Here is a game where Chuz tried to 1v5.](https://imgur.com/a/x70cU) It just wasn't possible. I mean this was OCE challenger and the whole of the blue team were scrubs and had no macro sense, but still wasn't possible to for Ekko to carry it. The blue team just grouped like a herd of baboons and still won (one guy got caught in the lategame).\n\nWould be nice to see more carry potential in the game, like Scarra says.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"18cent","date":"2018-04-10T10:18:32.845+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"0-10 yasuo in mid before 20 mins on my team and a 2-10 twitch lol thought these fairtys tales only happend in bronze 5\n\n****yasuo is plat****","replies":[{"poster":"Scottez","date":"2018-04-10T13:13:48.695+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Bro i had a perfect game 2 days ago for the first time in a very long time. Every team member had at least 4 kills (except supp) and we got all towers, inhibs, drags and rift scuttler and i think the highest kills was on the mid that had 9 kills. Enemy didn't kill one person and didn't get one tower. Everyone fed on the enemy team so consider yourself lucky only two did in your game, but shit stomps happen. I had my one and only chance to fight seras dragon in league and our team just got completely rolled on, disappointing but it happens man.","replies":[{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2018-04-10T14:03:15.345+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"{{sticker:slayer-pantheon-thumbs}}","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"SovietStalin","date":"2018-04-10T13:40:57.649+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Just gitgud","replies":[]}]}
