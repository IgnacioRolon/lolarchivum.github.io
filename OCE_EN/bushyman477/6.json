You are playing kog&#039;maw (0 mobility champion) and used your flash 150 seconds ago, but are being ganked and need to escape. You push Reduce, and your flash is halved by base cd (150sec), and is up again, and you flash to survive.\r\n-This spell has to be viable, so maybe have a 5 minute cooldown.\r\n-Using flash as an example, every 5 minutes, you could flash, then 2.5min later, you flash again, and now wait 5min to repeat.\r\n-This would work on other spells too\r\nE.g. You are toplane and teleported to lane 150seconds ago, but a teamfight is erupting at dragon and you push Reduce, and now can teleport in to that teamfight.\r\nE.g. You are a support with decent mobility (Braum) so you take Exhaust and Reduce, that way you can fight botlane regularly while maintaining  a your W to escape.\r\n\r\nGranted this spell would be strong on champions like Leblanc paired with Ignite as she has high mobility to escape, but frequent use of ignite in 1v1&#039;s.\r\n-Maybe Reduce cannot be paired with Ignite and Smite, so when either summoner spell is selected in champ select, Reduce is grayed out?\r\n\r\nThis is an idea I had, and currently don&#039;t see why this spell or similar can&#039;t be implemented (considering we haven&#039;t had a Spell added in a while) and have no idea where to put this, so here&#039;s to hoping Riot agrees!\r\n\r\nAny thoughts?","replies":[{"poster":"ScrubCloud","date":"2015-11-23T07:40:01.781+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"This is actually a very good idea as a summoner spell, taking a spot to provide main use of the other Summoner Spell.","replies":[]},{"poster":"JasonWazza","date":"2015-11-23T07:35:55.641+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Flash while it may be counterproductive at this point is required in the game, or else we will face the worst of mobility creep.\n\nAs for your concept of rewind, fact is it's a waste of a slot really, having 2 summoners that have utility rather then one that does (IE: TP/Flash over TP/Reduce) makes a huge difference.\n\nNot to mention i think you under estimate just how annoying this spell is, it's not going to be a \"Use this to get your SS off CD now\" it's going to be \"i used a SS now i will use Reduce\", Add to this Summoner spell CD reduction available (ionian boots and Mastery) and it means instead of having a 200ish second flash, you now have a 100ish second flash (and that is disgusting.)","replies":[{"poster":"Bushyman477","date":"2015-11-23T07:41:46.083+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"But like I said, base cd, so lets say Reduce ignores applied cooldowns reductions to SS, its not actually that bad of a spell. If you are a champion like Riven or Fizz who has high mobility and can go without flash, then its use it quite high as they will have a hell of a lot more 1v1 chances. Yet on someone like kogmaw mid, having flash with the ability to reduce would be quite good","replies":[{"poster":"JasonWazza","date":"2015-11-23T07:44:53.565+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I think you don't really understand the point of \"Obvious weaknesses\"\n\nKog'maw isn't broken because of 2 reason's right now.\n\n1. Lack of mobility\n2. Reliance on items (this is the pre-season patch)\n\nIf you basically remove #1 because of this spell (which you basically would be able to) then you have other problems of this SS just being like flash in that it's basically required on every champion.\n\nAnd for the love of god, i don't want everyone having what is essentially 2 flash summoner spells.\n\nReduce would be borderline broken, especially if you just build Ionian boots and have the CD reduction on summoner spells (having a 100 second window to gank someone who just popped their flash isn't a meaningful weakness.","replies":[{"poster":"Bushyman477","date":"2015-11-23T08:14:01.690+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I don't think you really understand the fact that this was an idea okay? you don't have to shoot down everything I say","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}
