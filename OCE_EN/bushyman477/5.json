The rock broke in two. The wind but a mild breeze passing over the blades of grass. _Clink_. The rock broke again. The afternoon sun beamed down upon the workers. _Clink_. The rock disintegrated into chunks the size of one&rsquo;s head. Dorrick leaned down to pick up the fragments before tossing the stones into the nearby wheelbarrow. \r\n&ldquo;Aight, thas&rsquo; enough for today&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;Best get an early sleep, tomorrow&rsquo;ll be a long day o&rsquo; digging!&rdquo; he enthusiastically exclaimed as he chucked his pick into the barrow. With a satisfied look on his face, the jaded old farmer headed off towards the shed.\r\n\r\nPutting down his pickaxe, Deonte wiped the sweat off his forehead. &ldquo;Reckon he&rsquo;ll give us extra for tomorrow?&rdquo; he queried. Ayla turns to him with a disdained look on her face, &ldquo;Well, maybe if you hadn&rsquo;t _accidentally _ set his prized goats loose, we might actually have been able to enjoy our one free weekend&rdquo;.\r\n\t&ldquo;Oh, come on,&rdquo; Deonte replied, &ldquo;You know as well as I do that the old man cares for nothing but himself&hellip;it&rsquo;s good for a man to be set in his rightful place from time to time&rdquo;.\r\nAyla flicks her head and storms off towards the gate with her childhood friend following.\r\n\t&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s see if we can stop by the market on the way home, they might have some unwanted scraps&rdquo; Ayla claims. The two of them shut the gate and untethered their horses, before trotting off down the track towards the Faerndel Village.\r\n\r\n_Swoooooooshhhhh_. The sky blackened briefly before returning to the dying golden sun glow. Ayla and Deonte stopped and looked upwards immediately, before exchanging worried glances. &ldquo;Wha&hellip;what was that?&rdquo; Ayla stuttered. Deonte shook his head, &ldquo;No idea, one of those Freljordian mountain eagles?&rdquo; he attempts.\r\nSuddenly, a long but slim dark figure darts back across the sun. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s headed for the village!&rdquo; exclaims Ayla, pointing towards the sky.\r\nWithin seconds, the object slows its descent into a hover, a hundred yards above the homesteads. Its glistening scales catch the light as the beast comes into view.\r\n\t&ldquo;De&hellip;Deonte&hellip;. is that&hellip;is that what I think it is&rdquo; she shook her head in disbelief. Before Deonte can reply, the beast arches its head back before thrusting it towards the ground and opens its jaws wide. A jet of white-hot flame erupts from its gullet, shooting down onto the houses. The beast arcs from side to side, ensuring no house is left uncharred.\r\n\t\r\nDeonte puts his hand on his friends shoulder and shakes her out of her trance, &ldquo;We have to get to the castle!&rdquo;. Ayla kicks in her stirrups and wheels in the opposite direction. Galloping away with Deonte in hot pursuit, the two race for Faerndel Castle.\r\n \r\n**Part Two**\r\nSir Adrew Tiren rushes towards the ramparts, heeding no attention to the worried soldiers standing there. Using his hand to shield the sun&rsquo;s rays, he looks off in the direction of the burning village. &ldquo;Oh, mighty Gods, protect those people&rdquo; he mutters. Before he disembarks the wall, however, he glimpses out of the corner of his eye two figures in the distance, gunning it for the portcullis.\r\n\t&ldquo;Open the gates&rdquo; Sir Adrew shouts as he bounds down the stairs for the entrance.\r\nThe horses blast through the entrance of the castle, and through no will of their masters, both rear their front legs, knocking Deonte and Ayla onto the ground. Adrew offers his hand to Ayla, coupling her elbow with his other and proclaims, &ldquo;Did you see anyone else?&rdquo;. She shakes her head, and Deonte, scrabbling to his feet, says &ldquo;Was that a&hellip;a dragon?&rdquo;. The grizzled knight slowly nods his head in silence.\r\n\t&ldquo;I thought they were gone?&rdquo; Ayla challenges, &ldquo;Weren&rsquo;t they wiped out by the Dragon Slayers in the last Dragon Wars?!&rdquo;. Adrew replies &ldquo;What else do you know flies and breathes enough fire to incinerate a village&rdquo;. Deonte cried &ldquo;&hellip;our village&hellip;&rdquo;. Adrew grabs the teen around the collar and looks him in the eye &ldquo;Listen here Trapp, the only things dragons desire is the roasting of human flesh and if one has sought out our fiefdom and attacked, you can be assured it&rsquo;s not alone&rdquo;.\r\nWith that came a thunderous roar. A drumming of wind. A chill silenced the castles inhabitants. Looking skyward, they noticed four more silhouettes closing in.\r\n\t&ldquo;Get&hellip;to&hellip;the KEEP NOW! GO!&rdquo;. Adrew draws his longbow, nocking an arrow. &ldquo;Archers, fire at will!&rdquo; he yells as he looses the projectile. Deonte grabs Ayla&rsquo;s hand and pulls her away from the terrifying sight, stumbling towards the old stone Keep. Pounding on the door, the two yell for help. The door creaks open, and hands reach out to pull them in.\r\n\r\nAfter a few moments, their eyes adjust to the dim glow of the candles, and they see hundreds of people, young and old, women and children, all huddled together in pure fright. In the distance they spot Baron Gareth talking to Lady Arika. Walking towards them, wading through the crowds, Deonte leads Ayla. &ldquo;How safe are we?&rdquo; the youth demands of the leader. A steward steps forward to force Deonte back but the Baron waves him off, &ldquo;If they truly are dragons, then we truly have only one hope. And that hope hasn&rsquo;t been seen for many, many years&rdquo;. \r\nDeonte looks at Ayla, &ldquo;We should leave&rdquo;. Disdainfully, Ayla looks around before nodding, &ldquo;We have to do this, we have to try&rdquo;.\r\n\t&ldquo;Is there a back entrance, a small exit we can use then?&rdquo; Ayla pleads. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s no point&rdquo; Lady Arika replies, &ldquo;If they want you dead, they will have you dead&rdquo;. Deonte interjects &ldquo;Please, just&hellip;please, let us at least try&rdquo;. Contemplating, the Baron looks at the dubious Lady, before nodding his head towards a small door beneath the parapet stairs. With a silent thanks, the two head off. \r\n\r\nTogether, they grab the rusted ring of the door and pull. _Woooosh_. They swivel around, looking towards the front entrance. _Crrrackkkkkkkk_. Suddenly, a big chunk of stone falls out of the roof into the crowd, followed by a jet of white flames. Ayla grabs Deonte&rsquo;s hessian shirt and yanks him through the door.\r\n\r\n**Part Three**\r\nThe drones of the wailing echoed through the craggy cavern. The two hurried along the stone path, weaving in between boulders and crevices. Despite the chill of the mountain seeping into them, all they could feel was the warmth of adrenaline as they carried on. After a few minutes, the two reached a cavern that was open to the night sky. The stars cut through the blackness like needles of white light. With a frosty breath, Ayla whispered to her friend &ldquo;Do you think we&rsquo;re safe here?&rdquo;, to which he starts &ldquo;I hope-&rdquo;. Before he could finish, the bright stars were blotted out, and the bluish haze of the cave dimmed. A tremendous _whoosh _ echoed through the cave as it settled down on the rocky edge. Ayla and Deonte froze in pure terror. Deonte slowly grabbed Ayla&rsquo;s hand. &ldquo;Ayla&hellip;I&hellip;I&rsquo;ve got something I want to say&rdquo;.\t\r\n\t\r\n&ldquo;Well my friend, you can tell her in your own time&rdquo;. The ruff, broadly intonated voice cut through the chill. The silhouette of a man stepped in front of the dragon. A man bigger than most. A man carrying&hellip;a&hellip;dragon head? The man tilted his head in their direction &ldquo;Sometimes battle, is unavoidable&hellip;you are safe, with Braum&rdquo;. And with that the man spun back to face the ancient beast. Grabbing a piece of nearby rubble, he launched it at the reptilian nose. The dragon did not like that. With a screech, it arched its neck backwards, preparing for the devastating inferno it was about to unleash on these pitiful morsels. A streak of pure heat came billowing from its mouth. When the smoke settled, the beast was surprised to see the three humans still standing, with the big one having somehow dispersed the wall of fire. Suddenly, a _whirrrrrrr _ sound from above. The dragon froze. It&rsquo;s burning eyes faded to nothing. There was something sticking out of its neck. Something long and sharp.\r\n\r\nWith a sickening sound, the spear was pulled out of the beasts neck. Pantheon leaped off the back of the dead scaly beast and stood proudly beside his companion. &ldquo;They disgrace the art of war&rdquo; he proclaims, &ldquo;But it is our job to stop them. Honour compels me&rdquo;. With a discrete nod he turns back towards the cavern Deonte and Ayla came from. The large man known as Braum leans towards them, and says &ldquo;Run to Demacia, tell them of what has happened this dark evening, they need to ready the armies. The war is not over&rdquo;. With a pat on Deonte&rsquo;s shoulder, he then says &ldquo;We will return to the battle. But remember, when the going gets tough&hellip;you call Braum&rdquo;. And with that, he turns to follow his brother, back down the cavernous path towards the perilous screeching.","replies":[]}
