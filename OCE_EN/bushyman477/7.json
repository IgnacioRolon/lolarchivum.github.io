I have been playing League via portable hotspot from my phone - not the best situation, but when you need to play league, you need to play league. The other day however, the game wont log in. I type my password in, then it says \"Logging in\" for about a minute, before coming up with \"Connection Error\". I have restarted the client, hotspot and even reinstalled the game, but to no avail. Yet, when I went to someone elses house, it worked fine. \r\n\r\nTL;DR - game will not advance past log in screen when playing on hotspot.\r\n\r\nHelp is greatly appreciated as it sucks not being able to play, especially as it's Ocean Week...","replies":[{"poster":"HORSE OF FORCE","date":"2015-01-27T09:12:02.794+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hi there, I use a phone's hotspot as my permanent internet source, yet I don't lag in game or have connection issues.\n\nHave you tried moving your phone to an area where it gets better reception?","replies":[{"poster":"Bushyman477","date":"2015-01-27T22:48:32.331+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yup, didnt work.
