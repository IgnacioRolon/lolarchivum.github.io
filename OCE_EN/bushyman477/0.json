Now I don&#039;t claim to be a toxic flamer, but I have been known to chuck around a few swear words. This account, however, I didn&#039;t realise how bad the volume of trolls in low levels is. I&#039;ll give a description of my last game, with a TL;DR after.\r\n\r\nI get in champ select. Call support. lock in Morgana. Everything seems fine till I realise our Darius has instalocked without calling a lane, and tops been called, so I ask where he intends on going to which he replies &quot;adc&quot;. Whatever. Get in game, and he runs toplane, and feeds the duo top, all the while typing in Chinese and constnatly saying &#039;so bad&#039; to our team. Our Fiora, 10 min later, gives up on the game and proceeds to only farm. The 360cs in 55min. 1/1/1 score. She refused to help, no pushing lanes or anything, often times just waiting for jg to respawn. My mid and jg are good, and I did well in a 1v2 lane bot, that is until Darius came bot and messed around. Long story short, the game was absolutely horrible. As it went on team refused to ff, there was little to no chance of winning (in my eyes, 40min and we were literally in same situation tower-wise as beginning). \r\nLONG STORY SHORT, I got toxic as hell towards the darius and fiora, understandably, but also towards my jungler who was now &#039;reporting me for being toxic&#039;, at which point I thought &quot;f**k it, if he&#039;s gonna report me may as well go out with a bang and go on him too&quot;...stupid thinking, but he was a d**k too.\r\nGame ends after 55min of pure agony ( I&#039;d have been content losing, or afking, I just wanted the game to be over), everyone decides to not report fiora or darius and instead me - I did play the game, albeit poorly due to my everhigh tilt, but they didn&#039;t - and I get the chat restriction...\r\n\r\nTL;DR I got chat restriction for being salty and toxic (understandably) but people ganged up on me and made me more angrier.\r\n\r\nNow. Ultimate question. How do I not be a toxic mutha? Like, I can&#039;t mute everyone, I hate not seeing messages. And I love playing with good people, I&#039;m a hella friendly guy in game if people are nice too, but I also like to &#039;voice my opinion&#039; on those who Int troll/feed, I shouldnt get the blame (Dunkey all over again) (*as much blame as the trolls that is). I need to learn how to be quiet and not get so salty. How. How. How do I stop getting worked up over tw*ts in game.\r\n\r\nThank you for reading my vent. I don&#039;t actually expect replies, just needed to get it out. Anyway.
