You are playing kog&#039;maw (0 mobility champion) and used your flash 150 seconds ago, but are being ganked and need to escape. You push Reduce, and your flash is halved by base cd (150sec), and is up again, and you flash to survive.\r\n-This spell has to be viable, so maybe have a 5 minute cooldown.\r\n-Using flash as an example, every 5 minutes, you could flash, then 2.5min later, you flash again, and now wait 5min to repeat.\r\n-This would work on other spells too\r\nE.g. You are toplane and teleported to lane 150seconds ago, but a teamfight is erupting at dragon and you push Reduce, and now can teleport in to that teamfight.\r\nE.g. You are a support with decent mobility (Braum) so you take Exhaust and Reduce, that way you can fight botlane regularly while maintaining your W to escape.\r\n\r\nGranted this spell would be strong on champions like Leblanc paired with Ignite as she has high mobility to escape, but frequent use of ignite in 1v1&#039;s.\r\n-Maybe Reduce cannot be paired with Ignite and Smite, so when either summoner spell is selected in champ select, Reduce is unselectable?\r\n\r\nThis is an idea I had, and currently don&#039;t see why this spell or similar can&#039;t be implemented (considering we haven&#039;t had a Spell added in a while) and have no idea where to put this, so here&#039;s to hoping Riot agrees!\r\n\r\nAny thoughts?\r\n\r\n*EDIT* The entire concept is based around champions who have a single important spell. Flash is taken 99% of the time, but champs like high-mobility ADCs taking Heal, Toplaners taking TP, offmeta mage supports who have to take heal/tp/barrier (because ignite or exhaust requires them to get close enough to die), etc, all rely on THE single other summoner spell. It just makes sense to have something like Reduce.","replies":[{"poster":"00shots00","date":"2018-01-31T04:55:00.164+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I like it and upvoted you. pretty great to be honest its not like its OP because you're losing one in a sense you're just stuck with flash on a sorter cooldown for 1 more use. no idea why they haven't thought of this well done man!\n\nP.s. the people that down voted you don't care about the game dw about them.{{sticker:slayer-pantheon-thumbs}}","replies":[]},{"poster":"TheDemonEmperor","date":"2018-01-31T02:15:53.201+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"With flash you can make reflex outplayed; And this concept is fun to watch in the pro scence.
