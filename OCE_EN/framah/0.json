He farms reasonbly quickly and is pretty healthy, floats on into my jungle and either kills me or takes my camps. I know I can just ward but that doesn't stop him from coming. The only counterplay I can see is to get my team to dive on him, but even then it's risky and relies on my team to actually come and help. I'm trying to get back into Kayn again and he is really fun but I have no idea what to do against junglers who can just walk into my warded jungle and take whatever they want, and also can pressure the map more with better ganks. I've had similar issues in the past with other junglers like Jarvan IV and the only counterplay I can see is to 1. Get teammates (Doesn't work everytime and the enemy can still roam, meaning they have 2 champions that can fight whereas we have 1.5) 2. Ward and don't let them kill you (doesn't stop them from taking camps) 3. Invade them (Only helps once I know they are invading me, and at that point they will always be one step ahead as they don't have to avoid me but I have to avoid them) 4. Counterpick at champ select (not actually counterplay). If anyone has any other advice they can give me that would be fantastic, I'm at a loss of what to do against these bullshit early duelists that still farm well.","replies":[{"poster":"Broken Scripts","date":"2019-11-26T02:40:49.333+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"1.

He relies on his autos to heal, if he can't heal, you win the fight as you will out sustain him as Rhaast, Randuins can slow him and slows his attack speed, Frozen heart is better if they have a lot of Attack Speed on their team (Randuins for Crit ADC, Frozen Heart for Attack Speed ADC), i'd then follow up with a 3rd item spirit visage (of course get boots somewhere early so you can outrun him if you need to), and then finish Thornmail, the rest of the build is up to you and your team comp vs the enemy team comp\n\nNoc is rough matchup, i've made many Kayn players rage quit because of it, it literally comes down to timing if you wish to win a fight with him Pre-11","replies":[]},{"poster":"Pikachoochoo","date":"2019-11-24T19:01:29.192+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"it is okay to be new, you know you can travel through terrain to avoid common/obvious ward spots, heal, and gank through more terrain if you combo it with mobility boots and mobility runes (if either suits and you give your allies enough warning that you're coming + looking/waiting if they are ready or near enough to see you coming in case they're new)??? Way better than having to wait for Noct ult. + using jungle creeps to fight with you by waiting/warding until Noct shows up and start it first before you sandwhich him which works greatly with warding his side too if it's worth the time (e.g you or your team have enough lead or your team doesn't need ganks much). + warding main crossing points or buffs that benefit you the most (e.g blue for cds n kiting or red for dps and running enemies down). Oh yeah  and maxing certain abilities to suit, e.g you only get e once and leave it as your last upgrade for when your other spells are maxed out (if pulverizing fights already easily for more dmg) or leave Q once (keep it at lvl 1 until it's your last upgrade again) and max E and W evenly for cc, kiting, and healing yourself in case you have too many feeder allies. If Noct's the only problem then keep your W at lvl 1 (to be the dumby spell to cancel his spell shield, if he even got it) n max the rest evenly n dance good (fight well)","replies":[]}]}
