I don't understand how to get top 4 in this game unless the game says \"yeah okay you can make it this time.\" I hear people say that you can consistently top 4 through better positioning and being able to adapt but no one seems to explain what better positioning is. As far as I'm concerned, beefy units up the front with your squishier units at the back and shuffle them around to deal with assassins and blitz. I've had people tell me \"Just build this comp every game and you will top 4\" but I don't know HOW when my comp relies on what the game gives me. I try to not commit to anything and see what I get but then the game gives me scraps. A couple of champions that have no synergy together. Meanwhile I'm getting fucked over with thief's glove and various two star/three star units whilst I can barely get my key units at all. I try to switch up comps but then I just trade the already shit comp I had for something even worse because everything good is already taken. I make sure to scout other teams so that I build something I can reliably get but EVEN THEN when no one is building the same champions as me I still don't get what I need. \r\n\r\nTL;DR. Tips on how to win consistently at TFT without relying on luck?","replies":[{"poster":"bgentle2myashe","date":"2019-10-27T21:59:28.473+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Well firstly, the positioning of your team should counter your enemies to be efficient. Problem is there is no way to know who you're next opponent is and you can get matched with anyone at time so you have to position in what could best be described as the \"average\" of all you're opponents. If you have 2 or more assassin type enemies then its worth putting at least 1 carry at the front middle. Alternatively you could put 1 tank or front liner at the back next to a carry to shield them from the side that one of their main assassins will jump to. \nPositioning is as crucial in TFT as it is in league. Also, item choice and upgrading is important. When you pick your team comp you need to build appropriately to that team comp. Learn what items belong on what champions in that team comp. Obviously early you wont have the right champions to put the items on so what ever is you're cheapest or lowest ranked champion that will be a \"throwaway\" later on should be given those items. So when you get the champ you are looking for you can throw away you're now \"unneeded\" champion and have the items ready to put with the new one. \nThings will change dramatically soon when the new TFT changes come in to fruition how-ever, one important and under-rated strategy that really good players use is to adapt you're team comp accordingly to what is available in the carousel. You need to pay attention to what synergies work and learn them asap. That way you are not limited to only finding a particular team comp. If Riot is hemorrhaging wild champs but you are set on knights, the game will more than likely pass you by. If you are a good experienced poker player you will know and understand the term \"when to pull the trigger\". This term is also extremely relevant in TFT. Knowing when Riot is changing champs available on the carousel or trying to throw you off the scent of a good team comp is a common issue no matter what rank you are. Admittedly, I am not a highly ranked player because I struggle to execute but I still understand the concepts behind the game. I also study a lot and watch streams and I highly recommend using one or all of these strategies to improve you're game. No guarantees of course but good luck and I hope you see success.","replies":[]}]}
