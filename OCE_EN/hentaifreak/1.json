I&#039;m looking for a Ranked 5&#039;s Team... Main ADC and Mid and Play Support well. Also Decent Jungler and Top... I have reached Platinum 1 in season 4 and quit in season 5... I just started playing last year in December and reached silver 1. My Schedules are flexible so i can join you guys anytime during training and i adapt quicky to any strategy. Hopefully this post will get a positive feedback because i can&#039;t make a team around my place due to people being very busy. :) Add me also on FB: Ezreal Miles","replies":[]}
