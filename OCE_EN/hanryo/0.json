This energy empowers its weilder&#039;s usually bleak abilities with the power of the ancient creators of the blade.\n\n==ABILITIES==\n\nPassive - Fight For A Cause\n\nFor every ally champion in range of *champion&#039;s name*, gain 2.5/5/10 armor and magic resist while above 80% health. (at levels 1/8/16)\n\nFor every ally who dies in range of *champion&#039;s name*, gain a temporary stacking damage boost of 1/1.5/2% for 5 seconds. Duration resets at every sequential death from the initial. Duration does not stack. (at levels 1/8/16)\n\n\n\nQ - Forwards Jab *WIP Name* (14/12/10/7/5s CD)\n\nThrusts your blade in a direction dealing 30/50/80/110/150 (+1.0BonusAD) physical damage to the first target struck, slowing them for 5/7.5/10/15/25% of their movement speed for 0.5 seconds.\n\n\n\nEmpowered Q - Blasting Jab *WIP Name* (Shared CD)\n\nThrusts your blade in a direction dealing 50/80/110/150/200 (+1.2BonusAD) physical damage to the first target struck, slowing them for 10/15/20/30/50% of their movement speed for 1 seconds.\n\nAdditionally, after striking with the blade, toggle Ancient Release off and create a blast cone of energy behind the first target struck, dealing 50/80/110/150/200 (+0.5AP) magic damage to all units inside the cone.\n\nThis blast cannot affect the first target struck and will not trigger if no target is initially hit with the jab.\n\n\n\nW - Ancient Release (7/5/3/2/1s CD after toggled off)\n\nWhen toggled on, initially consumes mana before empowering *champion&#039;s name*&#039;s basic attacks with the magic sealed within the ancient blade. Granting (0.1/0.2/0.3/0.4/0.5AP) bonus magic damage on hit at the cost of a  mana per second drain.\n\nKilling enemy units with Ancient Release toggled grants 5/10/15/20/30 mana restoration over 2 seconds.\n\nThe Ancient Release effect empowers Forwards Jab to Blasting Jab and Impactful Decision to Captive Decision.\n\n\n\nE - Impactful Decision *WIP Name* (25/22/19/16/12s CD)\n\nThrows the ancient blade to a targeted location. Upon impacting at the location deal 10/20/40/70/100 (+0.3/0.4/0.5/0.6/0.8BonusAD) physical damage in a small radius around the impact while also slowing affected units for 10/15/20/25/35% of their movement speed for 1 second.\n\nAfter throwing the blade, and all active and toggle abilities, except active items, are disabled until the blade is retrieved by being close to it&#039;s impact zone or by waiting 3 seconds for the blade to return itself. During this time, however, your basic attacks are replaced by punches that deal only base attack damage.\n\n\n\nEmpowered E - Captive Decision *WIP Name*\n (Shared CD)\n\nThrows the ancient blade to a targeted location. Upon impacting at the location deal 20/40/70/100/150 (+0.4/0.5/0.6/0.8/1.0BonusAD) physical damage in a small radius around the impact while also slowing affected units for 20/30/40/50/70% of their movement speed for 1 second.\n\nAfter impact, the Ancient Release is toggled off as energy rushes outwards in a circumference around the blade. After 1 second a cylindrical energy prison is formed, preventing entrapped enemy champions from escaping by any physical means of movement. This prison last for 1/1.25/1.5/1.75/2 seconds. \n\nAfter throwing the blade, all active and toggle abilities, except active items, are disabled. The blade is returned once the prison is formed. During this time, however, your basic attacks are replaced by punches that deal only base attack damage.\n\n\n\nR - Pillar Of Hope (200/160/120s CD)\n\nAfter channeling for 3/2/1 second/s, strike down the charged ancient blade from above *champion&#039;s name*&#039;s head to the Earth below. The blade releases a straight surge of ancient energy through the ground in the chosen direction at double the base movement speed of *champion's name*. Once reaching the casted length, the energy erupts from the ground into a pillar of raw ancient energy dealing 300/500/800 (+1.0AP) magic damage over a duration of 3/3/2 seconds.\n\nIf the energy surge makes contact with an enemy champion, it will stop early and suppress the struck champion for half the duration of the pillar. Converting 15/30/50% of the total damage to true damage; for the stuck champion only.\n\nThe channeling time for Pillar Of Hope is reduced by half when using it in the direction of a completely formed Captive Decision.\n\n==DESIGN==\n\nCurrently, there is no actual artwork to display the champion or their abilities.","replies":[{"poster":"CarIos","date":"2017-10-27T06:22:41.500+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"ANCIENT RELEASE ME DADDY! {{champion:50}} {{item:3113}} {{item:3113}} {{item:3113}} {{item:3113}}","replies":[]},{"poster":"Akkordian Zoeve","date":"2017-10-27T00:29:18.481+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Good, except Riot hates hybrid champions","replies":[]},{"poster":"JasonWazza","date":"2017-10-27T00:51:25.253+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"And you just made an AD champion that can abuse Gunblade.\n\nThe general issue with Hybrid champions, is that they can just pick and choose to take items that are super efficient (READ: Gunblade) and abuse them to their hearts content.\n\nBut again, in saying this, you have effectively made an AD champion\n\nFirst off, that Ultimate does way too much damage base line when you hit a champion (1k True Damage and a suppression is way too much)\n\nBut fact is, this is a champ where you avoid leveling W where you can, and just use the Q/E as an AD champion occasionally activating your W for a short time.\n\nYou basically build Gunblade on this champion once you start leveling your W (So maybe second to third item) so that you can abuse the free scaling but otherwise your probably an AD Brawler/Offtank, as the main \"burst\" to speak of in this kit is your Ultimate (And that shouldn't be a burst ability).","replies":[{"poster":"Hanryo","date":"2017-10-27T05:05:55.552+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I considered what you said and have made changes to all the abilities, some slight, some more impactful than others.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"heypoo","date":"2017-10-27T11:34:21.296+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"why U DO THIS","replies":[]},{"poster":"Mozzie25","date":"2017-10-27T01:58:05.424+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The scalings are wack. 1.0 ad on an ability that gets down to a 4s cooldown before cooldown reduction.","replies":[{"poster":"Hanryo","date":"2017-10-27T05:04:54.990+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Changes have been made","replies":[]}]}]}
