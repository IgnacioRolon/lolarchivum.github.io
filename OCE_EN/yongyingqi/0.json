Building a relic shield makes your job even easier, healing up whatever the adc does end up taking through your wall. Taking exhaust makes eliminating the enemy adc as easy as pie. Due to yasuo's high mobility and shield, this makes it easy to dash quickly to the enemy adc (or supp) for a quick eq combo then dashing back out on the wake of a w, making hurting you for a substantial amount near impossible. if its too risky to eq around, stack q up on high health minions(or minions you exe to heal adc) to then wind up a whirlwind, then using the cc it provides to give your adc the opportunity to either heavily damage or even kill the hit enemy. If you can hit a 1/2-3/4 health enemy adc with whirlwind, going in on with r and exhaust makes their chance of survival around about 10-15% (unless they have tahm) because this allows their adc to be 2v1 banged with reduced damage and defence, while under the effects or around 2 second knockup/suppress combo. And you just build yasuo, with a mix of some supp in there. Enjoy rekin like a boss, if you have the mechanical skill to use yasuo like a boss that is.","replies":[{"poster":"Zorphiax","date":"2015-07-27T11:30:50.940+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Talon12,realm=OCE,application-id=FjGAIbRv,discussion-id=gQZ2sxEq,comment-id=0001000000000001,timestamp=2015-07-27T11:04:46.054+0000)\n>\n> seeing as bot lane is usually ranged harass your w comes very handy in protecting yourself and your adc from poke while also being able to trade back.

Because of yasuo high mobility, and that most fights like that occur around minion waves, yasuo can easily dash out of her ultimate range, then chucking back his q to ult whoever doesn't have her e on them, yasuo does well if he is moving fast so its hard for the enemy team to keep track of what he is doing\n\nalso most people don't believe because its hard to do, but if you time your w right you can block nauts ulti (time it to overlap one of the mini wakes will cancel it.)","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Talon12","date":"2015-07-27T10:54:51.804+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"it works only when a boss plays it","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Chicken4dinner","date":"2015-07-27T22:04:46.770+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"No sustain, clearing camps is fairly limited and the jg items limit his kit.\n\nPlus his ganks suck","replies":[]}]}
