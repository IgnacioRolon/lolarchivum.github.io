The item can melt tanks super fast if they try to chase. Tanks also typically can't deal enough damage to kill of a smart Teemo. \n\nI think the best way to kill off a Teemo is to 100-0 one. In other words, pick assassins.

Tanks can kill Teemo if they have a good gap closer and can stick, but a good Teemo should be able to get away (bushes, shrooms) or not get too close in the first place. \n\nI think also everyone is saying \"build MR\" but check what the Teemo is building first. \n\nVoid staff counters MR: Teemo builds Void, you build Health. \nLiandrys counters Health: Teemo builds Liandrys, you build MR. \n\nVoid is also core on Teemo (he scales on MPen, not AP).","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Jink","date":"2015-07-25T18:01:18.848+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Just pick Olaf, run through 300 shrooms killing all allies following you and E him a few times then throw Axes at him, pop youmuu's, QSS, flash Ignite chase after him furtherly throwing axes at him then die, throw your keyboard at your screen and afk like everyone else does when they face this rat p.o.s.\n\nhttp://apollo-uploads-oce.s3.amazonaws.com/1437847312/images.jpg\n\nR.I.P All teemos you will not be missed in the 1 game out of ten you do die.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Elendil","date":"2015-07-25T10:17:46.325+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"{{item:3151}}, bye bye mr.tank!","replies":[]},{"poster":"JasonWazza","date":"2015-07-25T07:55:58.656+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Depends on the tank.\n\nIf the tank has a gap close and doesn't rely heavilly on AA's then yeah it will work fine.\n\nAgain make sure to fight on your terms when his on CD's, and get your sweeper upgrade and pinks.","replies":[]}]}
