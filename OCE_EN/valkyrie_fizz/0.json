But that doesn't mean 20 minutes (it was initially 3, and I was thinking of 10 at the most). \n\nWhat's even worse, is that after I've been in queue for 20 minutes, I get auto-filled into ADC anyway... So literally wasting 20 minutes of my time to get into 40 minutes of a position I hate and am useless at, and BOOM! just like that I'm down 20 LP.","replies":[]}]}
