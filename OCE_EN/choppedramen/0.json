So I go into my match history and find that someone had hacked into my account and played 2 ranked games with Orianna. I have never used any 3rd party services, and I have never even played or bought Orianna before! I only play Top and Junglers! I've had this account for 10 years now and I can't believe that this is happening!\r\n\r\nIs there anything else I can do other than submitting a \"Recover my Account\" Ticket??\r\n\r\nPlease help!!","replies":[{"poster":"Project Xayah","date":"2020-02-25T22:58:27.183+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"The Account Recovery ticket is a good step. The Support Agent will take you through the process of verifying you're the original user, during which they'll ask a bunch of questions relating to the account to do so (you don't have to answer all of them, just enough to prove your identity, try to give as many answers as possible, and any information not directly accessible on the account or 3rd party services can help), and they'll look for a compromise period. If they can detect a compromise at the same time as the offences, they should be able to remove the associated punishments and you'll be good to go. It's important to note that any history of account sharing *may* mean Account Recovery isn't possible.\n\nIn addition to that, it's a good idea to go through some of the general safety and security stuff with being compromised, such as;\n\n* Change your password, if you haven't already.\n* Run an anti-virus scan on any computers you've used for LoL recently (I'd recommend Malwarebytes Anti-Malware Free for manual scans, which can be used in addition to other AV software, but your choice). It might find nothing, but always a good idea to check.\n* Verify security for other accounts, especially ones with sensitive information such as bank accounts, emails, government etc. The website https://haveibeenpwned.com/ is a good resource for helping to track down potential compromises.\n* If you've played LoL on any computers you don't own recently, it can be prudent to notify the owner(s) of those of the possibility of compromise. If you use public computers, a quick check before doing anything with them can help protect you (looking for anything unusual attached to the computer, especially if the tower is easily accessible, and checking Task Manager [or similar service] for any unusual processes is a quick and easy task; if you find anything suspicious, let the owner know).","replies":[{"poster":"Exarch Leona","date":"2020-02-28T23:07:38.458+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"Don't lie to the poor guy.
