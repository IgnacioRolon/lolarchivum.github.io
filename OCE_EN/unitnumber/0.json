He said he wanted to bash their heads in and after I told him that kind of behaviour wasn&#039;t on he decided to direct his anger towards me and generally be a disgusting person with more detailed threats about how he&#039;d murder me as he went on and asking me if I was a male or female which I never answered because he was obviously looking for something to insult me about regardless of what I told him.\r\n\r\nThe thing that took me by surprise the most though was that as soon as he&#039;d finished his rant and he unfriended me. The entire conversation was gone?\r\nI couldn&#039;t screenshot it or copy paste it or anything. It just disappeared. \r\n\r\nMy question is, is there a way to report people who are so persistent as to constantly friend request then threaten my life multiple times (which I&#039;m pretty sure is **illegal **when done face to face)? and why is all the incriminating evidence removed from my access as soon as he unfriends me? It seems pretty ridiculous that they are allowed to get away with that sort of behaviour and not give and way to report it.","replies":[{"poster":"DarkShade918","date":"2019-01-04T07:27:55.093+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"Just send a ticket to riot under reporting other players, state this players name, and then they can go through your logs with that player (or at least i hope they can, since once its on the net, it can't leave)\n\nOtherwise, in future if this happens, instead of just letting it happen, screenshot/copy paste as it happens so even after the leave (even if you can't get a full transcript) you  have evidence of what transgressed","replies":[{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2019-01-04T07:49:32.897+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"^ This.

This was the reply I got. \n\nHello,\n\nI'm sorry to bring you these news, but we cannot police personal direct messages, and thus you are responsible for your own interactions with anyone. Keep in mind that you should contact your local authorities if you feel threatened due to your interactions with other players.\n\nPlease keep in mind that you should not ever keep anyone in your friends list if you don't want to chat with them. You always have the option of blocking other players, and I advise you to make use of it anytime you feel uncomfortable talking to them about anything.\n\nI hope that you will understand the fact that continuing any bothersome conversation with someone in private messages is your own responsibility- again, as previously mentioned, you always have the blocking option available.\n\nPlease let us know if there's something else we could help you with.","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"UnitNumber","date":"2019-01-04T07:48:29.230+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thank you! this is what I was looking for.\n\nTo be honest I didn't think about screenshotting the conversation until a few seconds before he unfriended me.\nHopefully, the ticket will sort things out.\n\nThanks again for the info.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"TheDemonEmperor","date":"2019-01-04T06:27:21.621+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Without evidence.

Yes! so practice what you preach, walk away. Dont be \"petty crap\". \n\nYou think turning a blind eye to a disagreement is being holier than thou? It seem like that is your moto.
