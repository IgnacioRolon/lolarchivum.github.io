Account sharing is also against the ToS.\n___\nIf you wish to appeal the ban then you can [submit a support ticket](http://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/requests/new), however, if they say no then on a second look the ban is still legitimate, and the chances of getting your account unbanned are basically zero.\n\nPlayer support cannot tell you what was detected because that would also tell you and anyone you chose to share the information with what was NOT detected and thus it compromises further investigations.","replies":[]}]}
