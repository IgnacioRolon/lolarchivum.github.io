Players need to think ahead before starting a game, that is if they want to win it :)","replies":[{"poster":"Last GuardiaN","date":"2015-03-31T13:19:51.635+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"i am just thinking, if people starts feeding there must be a reason, but if team cares enough and work good enough, they problem can be solved as well, or you get a GG but everyone is happy yea?; )","replies":[]}]}]}
