When it logs me in after trying 473628976 times, it doesn't connect the chat, and I have to do it manually, and it doesn't always connect. When I try to start a match it lets me into the room, I can decide my champ and everything, and after it doesn't load the loading match page. And \"unable to connect to the server\" comes up. \"Try to check the firewall etc\" which I never had on. So now I have 10 minutes of leaverbuster on me, for no reason. This is so utterly annoying. I've been trying to play all day and this doesn't seem to have an end.

Oh, that's right. There are no forums, riot stuffed that up too.\nNVM, perhaps they get the servers up soon and I be too busy playing to badmouth them.\nRemember a few months ago.
