I lost -23 LP for BOTH matches, which is pretty much the worst case scenario... \r\n\r\nOne was a straight-up 3v5, the bot lane just left the game at level 3. In the other our top laner was gone for 15 minutes.  From the results of both games, you can clearly see it was an unfair loss. Yet the losses still stand, and I&#039;m willing to bet those trolls got away with it.\r\n\r\nI can&#039;t get the one hour of my free time back... but I&#039;d like to see some compensation because I have hideously rotten luck when it comes to these things.","replies":[]}
