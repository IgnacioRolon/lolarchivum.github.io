I could ALT+Tab and use the messenger system, go on Facebook etc and everything was fine. 4 out of the 10 players complained about the lag that we were experiencing. I even contacted my ISP to see if it was their end that was messing up with my game play. They said everything was fine (which is what I expected). We lost the game and I was put into low priority queue for 5 games, which is a pain in the ass. \r\n\r\nAnyone else having problems like this? I contacted Riot Marauder on Facebook and he gave me some links to things I should read. He&#039;s the reason I posted here. It seems like we get the poo end of the stick. Updates coming last and long response times (if any) \r\n\r\nHate to be rude but just my honest opinion.","replies":[{"poster":"HORSE OF FORCE","date":"2015-04-07T06:32:07.626+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":">Hate to be rude but just my honest opinion.\n\nIt's not an opinion, it's the truth.\n\nDo you have any other applications open while running League?
