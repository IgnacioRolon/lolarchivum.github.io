I don&#039;t know if anyone remember&#039;s Age Of Empires? Anyway, one aspect of that was that part of your team could be turned or coerced to the other side. A little priest would come out and cast a spell to take your men. Instead of a surrender option why not ask players to &quot;Change sides&quot; And make the game more interesting. It would be human nature after-all to consider that. Are yu more likely to win changing sides? Or stick with your teammates? That would the question everyone would wonder through the game. Who is selling out? What do others think of this?","replies":[{"poster":"Project Xayah","date":"2018-03-22T08:49:52.909+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Converting units in AoE and converting champions in LoL are *very* different things. When it comes to AoE, converting a single unit has a rather insignificant effect, especially in the large scale, whereas with LoL, converting a champion would pretty much guarantee victory for the team that player joins, resulting in a ridiculously unbalanced match (and there's already enough reasons for people to complain about balance).\n\nThat said, it could be possible to \"convert the concept\" (sorry, couldn't resist) into a Featured Mode. Could make it so that, at given intervals, 2 players, 1 from each team, are offered the opportunity to swap teams. If both accept, give it a short animation (I'm thinking recall/teleport style) with invulnerability for the duration of it and then have them appear in their \"new\" teams fountain.","replies":[{"poster":"Nightjar","date":"2018-03-22T15:56:46.447+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"you turned an idea that seemed untenable into something that seems like an incredibly fun mechanic (though it would be funnier with an all random gamemode and where team swap was enforced and might be something fun to add to an URF variant).","replies":[{"poster":"BrutonnWarrah","date":"2018-03-25T10:35:54.844+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thank-you I appreciate your comment.

Just two players would suffice. One opportunity each, at given intervals. Number's don't guarantee victory. Sometimes players quit voluntarily anyway, some purposely, and some involuntarily. But matches can still be won, if the other players aren't bot's.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Lord Sesshomaru","date":"2018-03-22T08:06:10.966+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Wouldn't that just turn a 5v5 _(which is more often than not, already unbalanced)_ into a 4v6?\n\nHow would you be supposed to win against that?","replies":[{"poster":"BrutonnWarrah","date":"2018-03-25T10:25:30.171+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The thing is you could still win, if the other players were good enough. Odds favor the experienced. I've seen it first hand in Player vs Player, three experienced champions can carry two inexperienced players, and still win. I think you even could limit it to one betrayal character. Depending on skill level. Start off that way perhaps? In some of the greatest battles in history, there has been betrayal, but there has also been great victories.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Iloveyoubabygirl","date":"2018-03-29T05:10:06.613+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"kek standard games had the unlocked team function option typically turned off unless they were trying to plant and cheese wins or were playing continental diplomacy ffa (Free for all) or something (both of which 'spiritually' occur in pub moba games for the record)\n\nbut yeah um i get betrayed as a team opener main at the least 5 times every game, just turn around and farm and fuck em, and just blow up squishies or take towers instead. put mute on if it makes u feel better","replies":[]}]}
