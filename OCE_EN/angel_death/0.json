I have been just muting people at the first sign of toxic behaviour and when I do I always have much better games and still win just as many without the added communication!

OFC they should not blame you everytime you die or make mistakes. But most people play for win in ranked games, not for fun","replies":[]},{"poster":"kaboomblah","date":"2016-06-11T03:26:10.221+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You must be ready to be criticised if you play bad. Well, in ranked anyway. Normals and bots is where you practise, you shouldn't be flamed there. But ranked games are where people are really trying to win and if you frustrate people time and again with bad plays, then you will be criticised. Just like sport is a meritocracy, so are ranked games. Nobody gives a damn about your personality or who you are, you just need to contribute to the team and not be a liability. Aye, games are supposed to be fun. But it's not fun for the four teammates who are losing due to you.","replies":[]}]}
