I seem to be getting no key shards no matter how well I play, recently I played a game of Jinx and had one chest available at the time so I decided I&#039;d do my best to get it. I farmed quite well and kept on top of my lane (even with my troll support Teemo). By the end of the 44 minute game I had reached 9/1/7 with 217 cs. When I got to the end of game summary I was extremely upset when I saw I only got a B+. Normally I wouldn&#039;t bring up such a petty problem but the reason I do bring it up is actually because of a friend, who went 9/11/7 on Caitlyn adc by the end of a 44 minute game (which his team lost) and received an S- for his performance and also received a Hextech chest.\r\nI&#039;d really appreciate some clarity on this topic, thank you.","replies":[{"poster":"Ingénue","date":"2016-04-16T10:09:26.129+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It isn't a set score you need to achieve, it's all relative to how everyone else on the server is doing with the same champ in the same role.\n\nFrom Riot:\n\n> It’s based on the champion and role that you just played in a game. So, for example, we look at Annie mid differently to Annie support. We take a series of performance metrics and compare how you do to all other players in your region in your champion / position combination. It is percentile driven - so earning a high score means** you performed in the top x% of players** on that champ in that position. The grade itself governs the point gains.\n\n[(Source)](http://na.leagueoflegends.com/en/page/features/champion-mastery)\n\n[Basically grades similarly to a bell curve](http://study.com/academy/lesson/bell-curve-definition-impact-on-grades.html), meaning we have a server full of ADC gods. \n\nRiot hasn't released a list of the factors that contribute to a high grade, but I would suggest working on CS, objective assists, and possibly warding to bump up your grade that extra notch ♥\n\nIn terms of key drops in general,\n\n>>When asked about specifics on key fragment drop rates, **Wingfield** explained they key drop rates are not linear and the rates reset each month:\n\"Hey all, \nJust want to help clarify some things about key drop rates: \nKey drop rates are NOT linear and **only wins have a chance of dropping a key**. So you will earn key fragments much faster in your earlier wins than you will in your later wins. Or said another way, each incremental key fragment drop is harder than the last (on average... there is variance). This resets on a monthly basis for each player individually. \nThe goal is to create a nice ebb and flow. \n**Grade does NOT impact key drop chance. **\n**Premades DO increase drop chance. **\nHope that helps clarify \"\n[(source)](http://www.surrenderat20.net/2016/03/red-post-collection-hextech-crafting-on.html#6)\n\nWinning is the only way to get a key fragment, saying this, it's time to pull out the cheese tactics to secure that victory! \n\nPlaying premade is the other way you can try and bump up your key rates.\nEven though there has been no official statement regarding how much your chance of a drop increases while playing with friends, a [Reddit user collected some data](https://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/4atwfj/hextech_key_fragment_drop_rate_statistics/) regarding this. They came to the conclusion that there is approx a 5% increase in drop rate while playing 5man premade (of course, not definite as Riot has stated that drop rate varies from player to player, but it is still pretty reasonable). \nTime to start playing with friends to get your hands on that sweet hextech loot :D \nIf you don't have many friends to play with, check over on the [clubs board](http://boards.oce.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/clubs) or the [team recruitment](http://boards.oce.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/team-recruitment) board to find more. \n\nGood luck ♥","replies":[{"poster":"xJelly","date":"2016-04-17T00:13:33.842+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thanks heaps !!","replies":[]}]}]}
