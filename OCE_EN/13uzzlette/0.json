She only has 3 altogether with one the Sktt1 skin being limited to get. \r\n\r\nAnyways I was looking through some boards and found a post (the link attached) which had a death blossom zyra and an arcade (Mariobros style) design and they look amazing! \r\n\r\nZyra has so much potential to have such pretty and nice skins just like other champions for example lux and Sona. \r\n\r\nWhat do you guys think? Do you reckon it&#039;s time for riot to make some decent nice looking zyra skins, especially after her rework?","replies":[{"poster":"AShadowlilly","date":"2017-02-08T23:29:02.956+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Can we please get a new Zyra skin?","replies":[]},{"poster":"CookedChickens","date":"2016-10-13T23:34:23.863+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"They could make arcade zyra with her plants like Mario deadly plants","replies":[]},{"poster":"Mrs Venus","date":"2016-10-09T12:59:08.963+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yes..
