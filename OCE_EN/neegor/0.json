And there are plenty of those kids.\n\n>Truthfully, they mostly speak their language to see if anyone else in game can speak it with them. Nothing wrong with that.\n\nThose players you are refering to; Most of them are playing at an internet cafe while boasting to their friends that they know english; And to demonstrate, they swears in english, calling people dog, pig and other lowly animals. Aswell as targeting the parent or sibbling. \n\nAnd when they typed in characters, you can be sure if it's a losing game. 70% of those are insults meant for the intended target.\n\nAgain, let me reiterate, not all of them. But most of them.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"C9 Snocky","date":"2018-12-23T12:07:42.583+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Whilst I dont necessarily agree with region locking, I will add that the single time I translated pre-game lobby when I had 4 chinese players they were talking about how they were going to \"fuck with this oce guy\" by stealing blue on leash","replies":[]},{"poster":"QAPLA","date":"2018-12-20T21:39:46.097+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I have no issue with Asians living in the OCE region playing LoL on the OCE server.\n\nBut for us to be a dumpster for all the trash that gets banned from the Asian servers, no thank you.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Astara","date":"2018-12-20T10:02:54.084+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I agree only in that if they got banned on their own server, they shouldn't be able to make a new account on this one.
