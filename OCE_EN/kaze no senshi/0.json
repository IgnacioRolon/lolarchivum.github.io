The equations that Gathering Storm functions off are as follows:\nfor Ability Power: y=0.04x^2+0.4x\nand for Attack Damage: y=0.024x^2+0.24x\nWhere x is the time in minutes, preferable to use a value divisible by 10 (because 10 minutes per Gathering Storm stack), and y is the adaptive stat value. \nSo at 4 hours (240 minutes), the Ability Power value is 2400, you have that correct, but the Attack Damage value wouldn't be 1800, it'd be 1440.0.\nI'm interested in the equation that you used to find your values.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Support Center","date":"2017-12-20T12:48:58.068+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Whats the Formula for this?","replies":[{"poster":"Unbound Prowess","date":"2018-07-16T16:51:30.612+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"For AP:\ny=0.04x^2+0.4x \nFor AD: \ny=0.024x^2+0.24x\nWhere x is the time in minutes (use a value divisible by 10), and Y is equal to the adaptive stat. yw :))))","replies":[]}]}]}
