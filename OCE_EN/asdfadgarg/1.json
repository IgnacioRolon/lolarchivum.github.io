Returned to League this year and reached gold 1 without much hustle and I did this thing (requested my account data from riot) since my location changed a lot when I first created the account and I do not have the access to the original email either cause I went through 2 pc&#039;s and got a laptop now. I had an auto reply from blitzcrank bot saying it takes a month for them to reply with it for security reasons. A month has passed and here I am trying to log in to have a few games of ranked with my friends to get this message on the screen saying Your account has been permanently suspended.\r\n\r\nAnd now I am unable to recover my account :( \r\nSo just a wee warning to people who ever wanted to do this, Be very careful or do not do it at all otherwise you will end up just like me","replies":[{"poster":"Project Xayah","date":"2018-08-13T04:13:18.977+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Are you sure it's related to requesting your account data? It *may* be a matter of coincidental timing. Personally, I've previously requested account data on two accounts and had no issue with it, though that was several months ago.\n\nThe notification you received in the client should have informed you of the cause of the suspension, including chat logs in the case of a chat related punishment (you would have also received an email on the registered address regarding the ban). If you have not received that information, your best bet is to contact [Support](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/requests/new) (choose the \"I have a question about a suspension or restriction on my account\" option) and ask them to provide a reason for the punishment (you may also choose to appeal the ban, which may or may not result in the ban being overturned)). I would also recommend you attempt to change the registered email to one you have access to (if it isn't already), which you *may* have to submit a separate ticket to Support for if the standard method is not an option for you.\n\nIt's important to keep in mind that there could be any number of reasons that your account has been permanently suspended, depending on what's happened with/on the account, such as excessive negative behaviour, detection of third party software, account compromise (in which case, the ban is likely a security measure), just to name a few.","replies":[]}]}
