For security reasons, we are not able to do that while you are logged into a League of Legends account on our Support Site.\n\nIn order to proceed further, please provide me with a different email (one that is not associated with any League account). We will create a new ticket for you using this alternate email address, where you can reply and proceed further with your request.","replies":[{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2018-08-12T14:23:58.352+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"There's a few reasons you receive bans without explanation, usually they are a result of manual and/or unusual suspensions since the system doesn't have a way of automatically knowing what they were for, at which stage you are directed to support for context.\n\nIn your case, sounds like it was a security ban for suspicious activity on the account.
