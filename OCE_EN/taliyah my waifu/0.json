But if you're building her regularly, this is a buff. \n\n_Personally, i don't think Taliyah needed buffs at all, she is very strong, and in my opinion is perfect they way she is and i don't think Riot should go messing around with her, (if anything she probably needs a nerf). _\n\n**TL;DR:** This buff changes very little if you hit all 5 rocks. But it gives her more damage if you only land a few rocks.","replies":[]},{"poster":"I Stealth I","date":"2016-12-18T03:42:18.942+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Someone please get Lord Sesshomaru here","replies":[{"poster":"Lord Sesshomaru","date":"2016-12-18T04:34:10.824+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Don't worry, I'm on the case :P","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"BarryButcher","date":"2016-12-18T03:31:28.235+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"think your calculations are off friend.\n\nAt level 5 Q.\n\nOld value: 140 base + .4 AP and 50% reduction on next 4 boulders.\nNew value: 170 base + .45 AP and 60% reduction on next 4 boulders.\n\nAssuming 100AP\n\n140 + 40 = 180 initial. 90 on last 4. so 180 + 90 + 90 + 90 + 90 = 540\n\n170 + 45 = 215 initlal. 86 on last 4. so 215 + 86 + 86 + 86 + 86 = 559\n\nAssume level 1 Q and 20 AP.\n\nOld: 60 + 8 = 68 + 34 + 34 + 34 + 34 = 204\nNew: 70 + 9 = 79 + 31.6 + 31.6 + 31.6 + 31.6 = 205.4","replies":[{"poster":"Taliyah my waifu","date":"2016-12-18T03:35:47.903+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"it's 60% reduction each time\n\nEDIT: Nevermind I thought it was 60% then 60% again etc. lmao #notatruetaliyahmain","replies":[{"poster":"Your Neighbour","date":"2016-12-18T13:24:33.909+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Taliyah my waifu,realm=OCE,application-id=FjGAIbRv,discussion-id=3gmb0JbU,comment-id=00000000,timestamp=2016-12-18T03:35:47.903+0000)\n>\n> it&#x27;s 60% reduction each time\n> \n> EDIT: Nevermind I thought it was 60% then 60% again etc. lmao #notatruetaliyahmain\n\nCool ID","replies":[]},{"poster":"BarryButcher","date":"2016-12-18T03:41:18.496+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"yeh i had to double check that.
