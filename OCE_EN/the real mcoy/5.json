Also they&#039;ve removed unskilled player from the report list, however I had a riven in one of my games who has a terrible average on riven (it was like 3/11/5). she proceeded to lose lane and cost us the game, and I reported her (half cos I just don&#039;t wanna risk playing with her again) because I feel like playing ranked on a champion you know you cant play the the standard of the elo your in should be reportable. So just wanted others opinion on this and also if I report her will that ensure I never have to play with her again?","replies":[{"poster":"Project Xayah","date":"2015-12-24T05:17:54.323+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"There is no way to *guarantee* you won't be matched with a particular player, likely because such a system would be easily abusable. You can, however, wait one or two minutes before queuing again to significantly decrease the chance of being matched with anyone from your previous game, not that it's that likely to happen anyway.","replies":[{"poster":"JasonWazza","date":"2015-12-24T07:26:53.872+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You can friend them and then not queue when they are queued.","replies":[{"poster":"Omni Presents","date":"2015-12-24T09:54:26.207+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"This has got to be the best and dodgiest way to stop queueing with those who you don't want to play with.\n\nUnfortunately there is no way to do it otherwise, nor will anyone ever implement it. If you are just an ordinary player and never really have good games, you will end up having more bad games and than with your list of 'never gonna group you up' players, along with those who don't want to group with you, you may never end up getting a game.","replies":[{"poster":"JasonWazza","date":"2015-12-24T10:27:35.858+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Honestly i implement it when i run into obvious smurfs, that i don't want to run into on the enemy team.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}
