I was playing aatrox into a fiora, there&#039;d been so jungler intervention and we both had kills, Also they had an aa focused adc and jungler (i think it was a yi or tryn or something). I&#039;d built bilge water cutlass and ninja tabi, i was slightly ahead in harm kills were even, the lane was pretty even over all, either of us could win an all in. Anyway I rushed a thornmail at this point, proceeded to shrek her, finished botrk then went on with my build. Is thornmail a viable item if your laning against someone who does all there damage through aas, and there are other auto attacking champs on the team","replies":[{"poster":"Epica","date":"2015-09-13T02:15:46.815+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"The only champion you should ever rush Thornmail on is Rammus.","replies":[]},{"poster":"BarryButcher","date":"2015-09-12T16:16:41.692+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Thornmail rush was never good and with the recent changes to it, it is even worse to rush it now. Since the refelcted damage is now based more on your bonus armour than the enemies damage. (see patch notes from 5.16),\n\nI think any amour item would have given you the win in that lane. I mean, if they are AA focused, nothing wrong with Randuins since it has the Cold Steel passive.\n\nAlso you build is so bleh that game... Titanic Hydra + Thornmail + Bork... yuck. 0 synergy in those items","replies":[]}]}
