So far what I&#039;ve learned from practice games is you typically throw out all your spells at once, making it hard to work the procs in at maximum efficiency, more so if your assassinating people. The specific situation I was thinking of is there&#039;s a number of bruisers on the opposing team, and your spending a significant amount of time kiting. Lichbane seems great here as its a lower pressure situation, and it maximises your sustained damage. Anyway just wondering what the general consensus is and when it should be built?\r\nCheers","replies":[{"poster":"Olee","date":"2015-11-04T23:31:03.351+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Lich Bane can be a great gimmick build on Ahri and it's certainly lots of fun! But I wouldn't recommend it if you wanted to play a kitey teamfighting mage Ahri. In that case I would suggest swapping out your Sorc Shoes for CDR Boots+Morellos+Masteries=40% CDR and then building a Rylai's","replies":[]}]}
