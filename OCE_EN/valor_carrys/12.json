Interesting problems to solve in the early game.\r\n\r\nThe interesting problem being what order do you want to do the 5 available camps, because no jungler does the Raptors for the first clear, and hell most times Krugs are skipped for the first round so it&#039;s 4 most times.\r\n\r\nThe only problem to solve is what to do if your a farming jungler, and that is to change junglers.\r\n\r\n2. &quot;Where can i Gank?&quot;\r\n\r\nThe issue here is that is CAUSED by the changes.\r\n\r\nIf you have ever played any of the farm heavy junglers (Or just played Ivern) you will know the camp respawns are terrible for anyone who&#039;s question ISN&#039;T where can i gank?\r\n\r\n3. When early game jungle is healthiest.\r\n\r\nEarly game jungle was healthiest when most junglers had a choice on their pathing through jungle.\r\n\r\nNow though you are put down to about 2-3 pathes that you can complete, and there is nearly always going to be an optimal path which doesn&#039;t involve doing Raptors OR Krugs.\r\n\r\nHell this season&#039;s jungle is the first time that starting Red buff on Blue team is actually disadvantageous to basically any jungler that does want to farm, not because they don&#039;t want red, but because they can&#039;t realistically do Raptors level 2, and backtracking to take Krugs is wasting time, meaning the optimal path is Blue &gt; (Gromp, which is less of a backtrack) &gt; Wolves &gt; Red &gt; Krugs(/Raptors if your like one of the 3 that can do Raptors at 3)\r\n\r\nThis seasons early game jungle is the most monotonous samey shit that i have experienced, and riot making a dev diary saying that they wanted to make it less solved is terrible.\r\n\r\nSmite buffs were fine, and your justification for removing them was bad since you said it in the preseason.\r\n\r\nChanging it to just here&#039;s a heal on smite was basically you guys saying &quot;We know the jungle is too strong without giving smite something to help junglers, but we want to get rid of the one thing that differentiated the camps outside of how much a camp will kick the shit through you (CoughRaptorsCough).&quot;","replies":[{"poster":"FatedSaviour","date":"2016-12-16T02:10:28.597+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":">(idek how to quote so) you said people ignore krugs then go to 4, did u forget that people can go raptors second camp, like {{champion:14}} {{champion:18}} {{champion:28}} . you also talked about the main issue bieng, where do i gank, there is so much more to that when i play\nwhere to invade, do i change starting camp so i can invade, will i clear blue in time to leave without a fight, will my teamates be in a good position to help, can i turn invade into a gank, can i not only gank, but make them think they r in constant danger while i gank another lane, jungle probably has the most thought into the laning phase, not the most skill (adc's probably deserve that) but thought","replies":[{"poster":"Valor Carrys","date":"2016-12-16T02:32:20.205+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Eve can't do raptors early without a death wish, Tristana jungle may be able to do raptors, but that is basically a troll jungle (no offense if you actually play it, but it's not a jungler i would want on my team) and Sion was one of the 3 that can actually do raptors.\n\nWhat i was trying to demonstrate was that what the /dev group was trying to say they wanted to accomplish with this new jungle has failed, and actually made Jungle less unique and even more of a samey structure.\n\nThey were the ones to make it less of \"Where do i gank\" and more of an open path, but now if your not playing a heavy gank jungler, you will find yourself falling heavilly behind.","replies":[{"poster":"FatedSaviour","date":"2016-12-16T02:49:45.973+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"i tried trist jg once and failed cuz i got dorans btw, and the /all team proved trist can jg, mates have been saying only if u go ap tho, makes nno sense to me, and eve was a pure guess for me XD","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Talon12","date":"2016-12-14T01:51:29.262+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Mumu, rengar, garen, jax, reksai, sion, shyvana, vi, zac and warwick\n\nLooks more like 10 to me, not 3\n\nThough not sure about rengar, he could definitely do it before his nerf, not sure after though.\n\nBut yes jungle is unhealthy at the moment, a patching fix for that would be to make raptors have 20% less hp in first clear. Seriously, there are 6 (is it?) little raptors, and all of them attack faster, do more damage and are tankier than the big raptor. A camp should not be designed around \"Have i got massive aoe damage which i can use multiple times in 5 seconds? if not fuck it cant clear those till 6\" Raptors have a monopoly on jungle executes atm, and not surprising considering they do 150+ damage every second. at level 1.","replies":[{"poster":"FatedSaviour","date":"2016-12-16T02:12:28.681+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"i cant think of many aoe jg champs at the moment, but sion's raptor clear is so good, its not a chore, but an actual clear, that is, if im not invading XD","replies":[]},{"poster":"Valor Carrys","date":"2016-12-14T02:00:49.684+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Mumu, Sion and Zac are ok doing it at level 3\n\nThe rest either lose too much health or have to level their skills differently to do it.","replies":[{"poster":"Talon12","date":"2016-12-14T03:22:14.509+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Just thought about rengar, all they did was passive wasnt it, so doesnt affect 1st clear.\n\nRengar can clear it with his combo jump-q-e-w-q Garen's e clears them all to 1 aa worth hp and w reduces the damage, jax e allows him to clear htem out without taking damage, warwick out sustains them. Vi clears them easy with a full charge q then 2 e her shield blocks all their damage,  shyvana has massive aoe w with massive damage due to her 20% bonus ontop of the 7 sec of 80 tick, reksai can clear them all using tunnel q into untunnel into her q which puts all of them at 1 aa hp, and kill off 3 of them if you hit the mini's for your q.

I feel that the jungle has been way too simplified to allow for depth. And the plants changed the way people can gank. There's certain blast cones that are used in the same way all of the time...e.g. blue side jungler ganking top uses it to get in the bush. Slight advantage to blue side now that lane swaps are nerfed. Also the scrying bloom plant is really only used to deny defensive vision around objectives. No sensible jungler uses it **_before_** ganking. So it's largely untouched until objectives like baron are on the table - slight advantage to red side on this one. At least they removed the cheesy Krugs-to level 3-to gank plays. I'd still say that last year's jungle was more interesting and had more depth. They'll probably change it at the end of the season like they seem to always do anyways, so jungle comfort is only a season long experience.","replies":[{"poster":"FatedSaviour","date":"2016-12-16T02:11:20.233+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"what you said about junglers using it before ganking, yeah, thats so true, cuz they can see the plant going off","replies":[]}]}]}
