Understanding the game better can only make you better, not worse.\n\nAnd yes i watched the video, but that doesn't make autofill any less needed for queue health.\n\nNo one likes being auto filled, _(i don't like it either)_ but it does help us all have games much faster. So i feel it is necessary, _(especially if we are getting 10 bans soon, which will make loading screen a little longer as well.)_","replies":[]},{"poster":"CHEESYLEEKS","date":"2017-01-10T11:28:11.826+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Top to bottom, first pick to whats left thats it.

Most of the games, I actually get top and I do get support time to time. I've also never been autofilled, maybe because of support being my secondary preferred role.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"TheOneUser","date":"2017-01-09T18:37:48.294+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Faker once said that you're not good at league unless you can play all roles.
