He can fall behind  pretty hard if beaten in lane and suffers pretty hard if the enemy jungler can catch him in the early levels, and this can make him pretty useless till he can catchup or get 2 completed items.\n\nYasou has a high base skill requirement but you get rewarded pretty hard for being able to meet this skill requirement. Imo Yasou has some matchups where a good yasou is nigh impossible to beat and other matchups where he is pretty much screwed unless he's arkadata. There is a reason Yasou is a staple of high ladder ranked matches, picked or banned in most matches regardless of meta. With the changes to assasssins, shifts in the toplane, midlane and adc's popular picks he's not doing too well at the moment but he still has an acceptable winrate and yasou mains have some of the highest winrates among players who one-trick champions.\n\nRight now in the current meta; he's not really overpowered or broken, but he's still irritating to play against and whilst he does require alot of skill to be decent, he's by no means weak or disadvantaged.","replies":[{"poster":"Talon12","date":"2016-11-26T09:15:14.630+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Nightjar,realm=OCE,application-id=FjGAIbRv,discussion-id=VaaLt4dj,comment-id=000100000000,timestamp=2016-11-26T05:02:49.294+0000)\n>\n> Yeah someones never tried to play Velkoz, into Yasou, try it sometime, you&#x27;ll have fun.\n> \n> Yasou is overall very strong, he scales into the lategame extremely hard but still has an acceptable early game, he has a defensive ability most supports would die for, he has a dash that almost has no cooldown, he can do more damage than most adcs, he can outduel most champions in the game come midgame, he has the outplay potential to make is fairly possible to get a pentakill in a 1v5 if he&#x27;s snowballed, a good yasou can basically solo carry the game if he can get snowballed. \n> \n> He does lack in what he provides to the team beyond raw damage, an ultimate which works well in wombocombo comps and some defensive utility when diving poke based comps, and he does kinda of force the team to have some knockups since even for a good yasou, getting a 5man knockup on his own is very rare.
