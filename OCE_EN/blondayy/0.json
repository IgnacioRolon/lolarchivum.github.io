I'm B5 myself and can tell you for sure that finding duo partners is not the way to go about it. If you're always positive good for you, I try to respect my team mates as well and it really makes a difference in climbing that ladder. But personally I feel like duo is actually a really bad idea if you're doing it on a regular basis. Like, every now and then I think, \"Hey, that's my best mate online, we should duo a few games!\" But if you're going to put that effort into climbing the ladder do it alone. I guarantee that you won't be learning at the same pace. Plus you'll never be able to bring yourselves to criticize each other on an actual issue with their play for fear they'll stop duoing with you. I ain't here to tell you how to live your live but that's my 50 cents and I would advise taking it :P\n\n\nHave a wonderful day! ","replies":[]}]}
