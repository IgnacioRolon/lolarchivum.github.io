Getting an S rank is pretty achievable after a few games but the key fragments have a random rate. I guess this is to encourage more games and partying up, but when the S ranks outstrip the key fragment rate it can get a little annoying. So my idea is simply that when you get an S rank with a champ you already have a chest for that you&#039;d have a guaranteed or at least higher chance, for a key fragment drop. That means we can still play the champs that we love and a bit of the sometimes frustrating &#039;random&#039; factor is removed.","replies":[{"poster":"Bambooze","date":"2016-04-17T11:25:06.383+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Wait I forgot. Is it that if you get an S with a champ you've already gotten on, you can't get a chest or a key fragment?","replies":[{"poster":"Ing√©nue","date":"2016-04-17T14:32:57.248+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Just the chest.
