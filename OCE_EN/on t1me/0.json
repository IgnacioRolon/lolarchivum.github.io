I mean, worst case scenario you just choose the higher rank players because you can't distinguish what is better anyway but it gives everyone a fun competitive trial. My goal was to go as far as possible and I had completely open trials and trialed 100's of players over several years for my team, and the best players I got were from bronze-silver-gold, which make up the majority of the player base, the rest platinum and up just couldn't cut it.","replies":[{"poster":"SnowmanBlaster99","date":"2017-10-23T08:27:43.181+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It's a waste of time trialing players under d1 that would get cleaned out no matter how good of a team they were vs Challengers.

I'm a guy who you used to argue with a lot, but my main got banned. Since then I've smurfed through the divisions you think are at least kind of skillful and they're just horrible players. A lot have decent mindsets but they're bad players. Don't know priorities, mechanics are bad, low mental APM, fundamentals are bad, no strategy, don't have diamond eyes (lolsoc vid explains this), don't make % plays, can't abuse mistakes, make too many themselves etc. You're saying a team should look for those players as well as players who don't make those mistakes? It's like comparing a guy who's just learned the rules of Chess to a guy who's a grand-master, on paper Chess doesn't seem that difficult if you have common sense, but my God, it is a lot more complicated with a lot more shit in it that most people would ever imagine, League is similar and since you're only Gold, you've kinda shown that you aren't good enough to know such things.","replies":[{"poster":"Transcender","date":"2017-10-23T14:20:10.711+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":3,"body":"You must be holding back vital evidence to disprove my mathematics and statistics which show recorded evidence of the difference between multiple accounts and the effect that the luck of matchmaking has on them.

So if you play 1000 games, far enough of a sample size, you should get 50% win ratio correct? Everything should even out by + or - 5 games. If matchmaking is everything, good players won't be able to consistently get high rankings with high amount of games played. \n\nHow can people like this exist when they don't even duo queue? \nhttp://www.op.gg/summoner/userName=wanxiaowan\n\nI would take your statistics seriously, but I've literally been a booster before so what you're saying is complete bollocks to me. Remember this lovely game where I showed you how bad you actually are? https://imgur.com/a/af5nH\n\nI've debated with you over the Apdo statistics before. He helps his team more than you do, he doesn't die, thus it makes it easier for his team to excel, he is playing a role which allows him to do this better, he has better warding and more pressure so that his lanes don't take as much punishment.\n\nYour ranked games come down to your team, but your rank does not. \n\nIf you consistently out perform your opponent throughout the game in most if not all aspects, your win ratio with rise above 50%, by how much depends on the difference in skill. \n\nWhat I'm saying is true through almost all sports and games, if you play consistently better than your opponents, over a large amount of games, luck is no longer a factor thus you will have a win rate greater than 50%. \n\nI go through your account and you say luck is a thing when you have games where you go 4/10 and die to the enemy adc under your turret 3 minutes in? \n\nFrom going through all of your Twitch games, you have a really hit or miss play-style. You either kill the enemy bot lane early and snowball off them, or you die and feeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeed. You do not know how to play from behind and your playstyle sucks, you also seem to have a hard time carrying games where your team gets behind. A good player would be able to not have those issues. \n\nYou are saying that no matter how good you play individually, you can't climb well because of teams? So you're saying that people who miss 50% of their cs, try diving at level 2, try to fight when behind, never look at minimap, missclick all the time, yell at teams to drop team morale, die in lane solo every game etc will have the same win % as someone like Faker due to Faker only being 1 out of 5 players in the team?\n\nYou make a lottery winner analogy but the problem is there is no skill involved with lottery, knowledge of the lottery and mechanical skill (LOL) of the lottery mean nothing, everybody is equal, plus, there is only really 1 lottery winner, not tens of thousands, even millions who are above your rank.\n\nYou make soo many mistakes in your games. Not only that, you miss out on many opportunities, you do not know what to prioritize during a game and it seems that your fundamentals and decision making are flawed. You use bad strategy with runes/masteries and you are the definition of a 1-dimensional player. I even got to verse you myself and you had underwhelmed my already low expectations, I really think you should open your mind and become open to the fact you could be wrong because you obviously haven't done that yet. When I was 13 and in bronze, I had the EXACT mindset to you, I even mained Twitch at the time and I was a fool. The thing that changed my perception was the fact that boosting company's exist and they always are able to consistently boost players fast, otherwise they don't make any income. How can plays like Apdo, and now myself consistently climb to high divisions with high win ratios even when given low division accounts.","replies":[{"poster":"Transcender","date":"2017-10-25T07:48:34.968+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":3,"body":"Please stop trolling me and provide evidence that DOESN'T support my case.

Challenger players are lucky with teams. \n\nI proved that players who are good will have higher win %'s thus climb divisions. \n\nI gave a person who is a good example of this, played solo queue, many games, abnormally high win ratio considering the sample size. \n\nI point out mistakes that hold you back as a player and why you can't climb effectively. \n\nThe only thing that can really be taken as proving your point is the statement: \"Your ranked games come down to your team, but your rank does not.\" Almost all players can agree to that. There are games in bronze that even I can't carry, but the thing is, that's 1% of games, the other 99% I DO successfully carry. The higher you go, the less % you can carry due to players becoming better, making less mistakes, being smarter. That doesn't mean you can't though. I can go through your division with an 80% win ratio, sure there are times where I lose 3 games in a row due to horrible teams, I am not going to deny that, but because I am the only variable and I am the best player in these games, I am able to carry a significant more % of my games than I would have otherwise lost. If I lose 3 games in a row, I will win the next 10-15+ because I am better than them. That's the story of high elo players smurfing/boosting. They're CONSISTENTLY better than their opponents by large degrees and due to that they climb. \n\nAnd pointing out boosting companies exist proves what you are saying? \n\nYou are willfully ignorant. You are mad that after thousands of games you can't get out of gold and you fail to realize that people like me can go through your entire tier faster than you can gain 100lp. \nProof of boosters and smurfs doing this are out there. Get a boost yourself and watch your rank miraculously climb as if your teams are magically getting better and as soon as they finish climbing and you get back on, your teams are bad again as if the problem was you all along.

So if there are players who get up to challenger because of lucky teams, there must be players who get equally unlucky and get stuck in the shit in the exact same games.

They can consistently climb accounts fast no matter the division, mmr or role (excluding support) and are able to effectively have amazing teams over thousands of games played between them weekly. It's a statistical improbability that they're just lucky every single time. \n\nThe funny thing is, you're unable to argue against everything I say so you try to aim for my weakest points rather than my strongest to make you feel like you did a good job arguing, yet you're just using logical fallacy's to make you feel better about your statistics and reasoning.\n\nThere are a lot of things statistics alone cannot account for. \n\nHere are some things that could allow your team to perform better.\n\n**Lane pressure** - shoving in lanes, allowing your jungler to invade/play more aggressively, allowing yourself to ward and roam more, castrating the enemy mid laner and causing them to lose in cs as they will either not be able to cs under turret perfectly, or would run themselves out of mana trying to do so. You also bring attention to yourself, if you're pushed up the enemy jungler will want to gank you.\n\n**Not dying** - not giving enemy team gold, experience AND pressure. You also tilt your team really easily if you die, people give up real easily and kill deficits are the way for them to be like \"fuck this we've already lost\"\n\n**Warding** - so your team has more information\n\n**Dewarding** - to starve the enemy of information\n\n**Roaming** - to apply pressure, get your lanes/jungle ahead, good players abuse Fog of War to make enemy team assume they're roaming towards them, when in reality they could just be doing something else\n\n**Not flaming/pinging unnecessarily etc** - do not tilt players who can tilt easily\n\n**Great csing** - Teams who use tab and see you're up 100 cs will be like, damn that's pretty decent, you might be smurfing.\n\n**Absorbing pressure and NOT dying, especially from enemy jungler** - if the enemy jungler is in your lane, they're not in your teammates lanes, and your jungle has free reign of the enemy jungle\n\n**Over performing when it comes to damage output whether it be team fighting or making picks at GOOD times** - team will have more hope/higher morale if you hard carry everything, picks also don't mean much if you don't get objectives after it\n\n**Objective control / an eye for getting objectives** - by taking turrets, getting shutdown gold and dragons, you're giving your team gold and buffs\n\n**Being a recognizable and respected player** - if people realise they're on a team with the best solo queue player in the world, they're most likely not going to give up and play safer, the enemy team will be scared and start playing not to lose rather than to win\n\n**Pinging** - making people who are otherwise blind not blind by pinging them of danger or good calls you are making\n\n**Not getting them killed by making stupid plays** - they will follow you a lot if you're trying to 1v5 or something, and they'll die to and get tilted off you\n\nThe fact that Apdo specifically plays mid makes this easier although this can be used in all roles apart from support. Now let's see. Who would be better at doing this, a hard stuck gold 5 Twitch player, or players who are strategically and mechanically better than you, like smurfs and pros? Do you see why their teams perform better? You have to be INCREDIBLY biased to suggest that you do not falter in MOST of these, you average like 6-7 deaths a game whereas pros have far less and do far more.  You have averaged 9.1 deaths a game in your last 20 games, that's incredible. \n\nLets have a look at your account and gauge how well you do on these from the statistics alone.\n\nNot dying - you play like you're inting half the time\n\nWarding - you average like 3-4 a game, when the people around you have 10+, you are the inverse of a support player. YOU HAD A 40 MINUTE GAME WHERE YOU CLEARED NO WARDS, YOU PLACED 3 NORMAL WARDS, AND 0 CONTROL WARDS. DUDE. \n\nGreat csing - your csing is incredibly inconsistent which shows that you are too aggressive and you try to fight 24/7 or you're just horrible at last hitting, you should never have anything under 6.5cs per min on an ADC yet you have managed to get under that 8 times out of your last 13 adc games. So you're underfed on gold/exp.\n\nAbsorbing pressure and NOT dying, especially from enemy jungler - can't absorb pressure if you've already been solo killed in lane can ya?\n\nOver performing when it comes to damage output whether it be team fighting or making picks at GOOD times - your damage outputs are generally pretty good, but that's also probably because you're trying to fight every minute and why you average 9 deaths a game which is definitely not beneficial.\n\nBeing a recognizable and respected player - you are recognizable to anyone who uses boards, but not in a good way.\n\nNot getting them killed by making stupid plays - if making stupid plays had a poster boy, it'd be you.\n\nI did not list lane pressure, roaming, flaming/ping unnecessarily, objective control and pinging. Do you really think gold players would be better than pros/Apdo at this? Really?\n\nDo you understand why teams play better when they're around people like Apdo usually? Why the seemingly suck for you?\n\nYour results for whitepuma > whitepumah is cause you have a small sample size from what I've researched. You also assisted your team more and had less deaths, maybe it means something!!!\n\nYour logic is flawed and you do not understand the high level side to League of Legends like players such as myself and Apdo do. You as a player are horrible and make monkey decisions when you're playing which causes you and your teams to lose.

I feel like I am going to have to write up just one document, containing all of my data, points and mathematics because I feel like I am repeating myself over and over and over. I even stated some of the answers to your questions in this thread and you still chose to ignore them or maybe they are not within your comprehension, or maybe you just decided to not read them?\n\nI read everything, don't worry. Would you rather me simply not answer all of your bad arguments and instead ignore everything like you were with mine? XD\n\nDude, actually try to understand my points. To make sure we are on the same page. I am stating that regardless of how good your teams are, good players can always climb through them with relative ease until they reach their skill level in terms of division, where they would plateau and their win rate would start evening out until they get better and slowly keep climbing. That's what happens. That is also the reason challenger is the best division with the best players. The players who didn't plateau or were able to climb due to them being better than their opponents most of the time. That is also the reason why Challenger players (if tryharding) are able to absolutely demolish anyone under their rank. \n\n\n> The player who plays better in the same games will have a higher winrate, however putting players in different games will always provide erratic results.\n\nPutting players in different games does not provide erratic results if they are better than the players they are versing. Thus people who smurf, boost, pros fit in here. People who are in the highest division they've ever climbed to will show erratic results because they do not possess the ability to carry like people from higher divisions can because they're not as good.\n\n>First of all they don't have all amazing teams. They have balanced teams on average, some will be bad, some will be good, their ability will determine the speed they climb or fall at but that is on average, let me repeat, ON AVERAGE. \n\n\nOn average you get will get balanced teams over the course of a decently large sample size, good players can make their balanced teams look and play better. Thus teams don't really matter in climbing as it's down to the player to outperform the players around them. As I gave statistics for, you cannot really impact 25% of games unless you are astronomically better than the people you are playing against, although you can decide 75% of them.\n\nYour point is that teams are a large factor in deciding whether people win or lose a game. If you are better than the players around you, teams do not matter.\n\nFor instance, if you were anywhere near as good as me, you'd have 80%+ win ratio and wouldn't be complaining on boards asking why a team is looking for actual, good players. I just leveled my account to 30, and I have played 3 ranked games against high silvers. I have 100% win ratio with an average kda of 14.7 / 1.7 / 4.3.\n\n> That is how averages work, and that is also how luck works, the majority of the time they will be able to easily climb ON AVERAGE. just because it seems like a statistical improbability, doesn't mean it can't happen and would they give away information such as, not being able to boost a player.\n\nI was literally a booster (don't do anymore). https://imgur.com/a/1KTZE\nPeople don't fail. They only recruit the highest level players possible. They don't hire anyone under diamond. As I said. You control 75% of your games, you auto win 12.5% and you auto lose 12.5% (unless you're like 2 tiers+ above). It is entirely plausible to think that the best players in the world can climb regardless of team quality. The thing is, I'm not saying boosters never lose games, I have myself. What I am saying is that they'll win MOST, and by most I mean 75%+.  \n\nYou started this shitstorm by effectively saying  \"why not look at Gold players too, they could be as good for your team\" or w/e. \n\n>So I noticed, instead you are looking for 0.22% of the player base who are all just as shit as the other 99.78% due to a 1v1 system being used in a 5v5 game.\n\nThis is the most stupid thing I have ever read. You climb by being better than your opponents, helping your team play well and leading them to victory. That is what gets you over 50% win ratio over many games played which has been proven. Players who can't do that do not possess the mechanical ability and/or game knowledge to be able to carry games in their division. Over a large amount of games, you need to be truly good to have a high win ratio, that's why the best players are in the highest tier possible.\n\n>Do you even know what you are trying to disprove? You are claiming luck does not exist in the matchmaking system, but this lines up just fine with my point. Luck means chance, and \"when you have eliminated the impossible, whatever remains, however improbable, must be the truth.\"\n\nLuck does not exist because these players are good enough to win even when their teams all suck. If you want to say luck exists with teams, well yes, you get some good, some bad. It doesn't matter if you, the individual are good. You don't need your teams to be good. You don't care if they're bad. You just play well and win the game for them. As a smurf, I'd rather play with shit teams every single game than toxic, egotistical ones. \n\n>You realise both your jungler and top laner went positive right?\n\nYeah our jungler who was ignoring our team, afk farming and taking as much cs and buffs away from our team as possible and not helping us when we needed him to was reaaaaal positive. \nRiven dying 11 times and giving the enemy team pressure and opportunities to do things such as Baron/Dragon, take turrets, walk into our jungler fearlessly as it's a 4v5 and just bully us around was reaaaal positive. \n\nYou also need to take into consideration the fact that I was 19/3/7. It's easier playing with someone who is 19/3 than someone who is 4/4. If I was playing to the average level of a gold 5 player, their kda's would be A LOT worse. \n\n>Are you really trying to bait me out into posting MY damage dealt relative to my team? Are we really going to go there? Because that is not an accurate representation of performance even for a carry in a game. Objectives do not count as damage dealt. But if you are seriously inviting me to a damage dealt contest.. I don't have absolutely any reason to back down on this one.\n\nIf you fight the opponent 24/7, you're going to have more damage dealt, thats a given. But you are lowering the chance of your team winning the game if you don't play by fundamentals and knowledge. You dying for turrets and trading kills and such doesn't help your team. It's better to get cs than kills as focusing on cs will give you MORE gold than going for kills 24/7, it doesn't give you a bounty to give more gold and exp to enemy team, and most importantly, it will work 100% of your games. If you focus on farming, you really can't go wrong. If you focus on kills, you might go 4/10.\n\nThe point I am trying to make is. Luck exists over a small amount of games, not over a large amount. The \"luck\" factor is how well your teams play. If you are good you can override the luck factor and win regardless. That is why boosters and smurfs exist and are able to climb. Even in streaks of games where people are \"unlucky\" with teams, you can still win if you over-perform. I gave you statistics of carryable vs uncarryable games. I provided an example of a seemingly uncarriable game and showed how I carried and won it with all the KDA statistics shown and such, things you seem to value. \n\nThe reason you seem to think that Gold players are just as good as Chall is because of statistics you're biased towards. Not understanding what goes into being able to win games even with bad teams. Not understanding how much individual players are capable of. Anecdotes that simply do not mean ANYTHING unless you're talking about individual players where then you would near more than anecdotes to make a solid conclusion. And your own ignorance and lack of knowledge and skill about the game. \n\nYou've even versed me before and been absolutely crushed. I saw your play first hand as I was the adc opposite to you and you were horrible. You played as if you didn't have a brain. You didn't ward, you played horribly weak strategies with things such as summoner spell and builds (VERY large weaknesses) and you allowed us to abuse your weakness by pushing into us without your support having flash thinking you could 2v3 simply because you had 1 extra combat summoner spell...?\n\nI've even pointed out your mistakes and lack of fundamental game knowledge and you ignore them even though they're literally what hold you back from climbing. \n\nI have given you every stat and strong analysis to completely counter all of your points and you get salty that I write a lot and used word logic LOL. The thing is, I make sure I know what our argument is and I argue much stronger points than you do. I give statistics and points that counter your arguments, you half ass reply to them with weak points yourself and I am able to easily counter them lol. \n\nI use common sense, logic and knowledge to prove you wrong, but since you seem to lack all 3 yourself it's incredibly difficult to change your perspective. Everybody else would agree with me, but not you. That's most likely due to your ignorance and how incredibly close minded you are when it comes to having arguments over things such as this.","replies":[]},{"poster":"ThatsSoLiam","date":"2017-10-27T05:41:32.579+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I do know though, the statistics provide me with the information necessary. I can look at the kill graph, gold graphs etc and tell most of what I need to know. Spectating would be better but to me it's incredibly obvious what will happen if I watch them, you will play like a Gold 5, make Gold 5 level mistakes and I would have wasted hours of my time to prove to someone who will not acknowledge their ignorance that they're wrong, but they're ignorant so it doesn't matter.\n\nThere is by far enough logic, statistics and analysis to convince anyone that what you're saying is inaccurate. At this point, you aren't even addressing things such as boosting or trying to logically disprove my stats and analysis. You're abusing the argument from ignorance fallacy but it has been proven wrong.\n\nAt the start of this argument, your point was that teams are a large factor in how much you win. Players like Apdo's teams performed better, thus he managed feats such as getting to platinum(?) with a 100% win ratio. Which is true to an extent, he was lucky. Although the thing you fail to realise is even if he WASN'T lucky, he would still have AT LEAST an 80% win ratio if he was tryharding, of course there was luck involved, but the reason he climbed was not due to luck. \n\nYou fail to have properly disproved some of my arguments such as:\n\n> So you're saying that people who miss 50% of their cs, try diving at level 2, try to fight when behind, never look at minimap, missclick all the time, yell at teams to drop team morale, die in lane solo every game etc will have the same win % as someone like Faker due to Faker only being 1 out of 5 players in the team?\n\nYou'll say, \"Well Fakers teams simply play better so of course he is going to win!\". I explained what players like him do to increase their teams performance by playing well themselves.\n\n>Okay, you talk about using math right? So if you play 1000 games, far enough of a sample size, you should get 50% win ratio correct? Everything should even out by + or - 5 games. If matchmaking is everything, good players won't be able to consistently get high rankings with high amount of games played.\n\nOkay, considering your incredible sample size, why can't you or any of your friends get higher division? There are many people who play thousands of games who reach challenger, why aren't you one of them?\n\nWhy can professional players CONSISTENTLY climb to Masters/Challenger from Plat/Diamond every single time they get a smurf, or boot camp? Have you ever watched people like hi im gosu do unranked to Challenger multiple times and succeed every time?\n\nIf teams matter so much in depending how much you win or lose it's all about RNG in a sense, not literally but figuratively. You've gotta hope your team plays well, but for pros and high elo players, their teams are great EVERY SINGLE TIME. If teams matter so much, why do players like Gosu 1v5 pentakill and go 30/0 in their smurf games? The lack of skill of their opponents allows them to be abused by good players.\n\n>**Answer this, why do boosting companies exist and thrive? They can consistently climb accounts fast no matter the division, mmr or role (excluding support) and are able to effectively have amazing teams over thousands of games played between them weekly. It's a statistical improbability that they're just lucky every single time.**\n\nYeah, this one completely disproves you. If they failed to meet standard, they wouldn't make money, thus they wouldn't exist. The players don't often duo queue, and there are generally things such as 1 division per day speeds they need to keep to, which they do. \n\nYou also failed to disprove the statistics and analysis shown in one of my other replies. I gave you factors that definitely influence how well your teams play, and I elaborated on each point just to show you how in case you didn't believe so. I then compared statistics of your games to Apdos to show how much extra he does as a player to influence how well his team plays. \n\nYour statistics that you cling onto show that the accounts with the lower average deaths have generally, higher win ratios. \n\nThe only games that are out of reach (most of the time) for good players to carry are games where as an adc, your top, jungle AND mid feed. The % chance of someone in your team losing their lane is 1/2, 50%. The chance of both top and jungle lose is 1/4, and the chance that all 3 of top/jg/mid lose is 1/8. That means there are 12.5% of games that are near uncarriable due to bad teams (depends on division still, you can generally bypass this in bronze).  Also factor in the enemy team has 12.5% chance of top/jg/mid losing as well. So 25% games are out of your reach, you don't influence it unless you literally int. You will win half, lose half, statistically over a decently large sample size of 130 games +. That leaves 75% within your grasp to carry if you over perform for your division.\n\nNow, you say that teammates performance is a lot of the reason how people can climb, people who get lucky with it succeed, and people who don't, do not succeed. You fail to realize how much one individual player can do during a game. Not only can they influence how well their team plays with the factors I have previously listed, they can also over-perform as an individual player to secure victories. I will use an example of an account I have played on. \nThese are the most recent ranked games available.\n\nhttps://imgur.com/a/vKdZl\n\nI will analyse the Corki game, which is the most recent game on the account, this is in high gold/low platinum. A tier above you.\n\nhttps://imgur.com/a/adBmE\n\nhttp://matchhistory.oce.leagueoflegends.com/en/#match-details/OC1/188642178/200506640?tab=overview\n\nHow did I win when literally only Lulu - the support - played well on my team?\n\nI dealt 1450 damage per minute in a game where we were losing the entire time\n\nI got my first kill by invading the Ezreal jungle early on (as a midlaner), I then invaded him 4 minutes in and killed him again, and my next 3 by ROAMING and getting my botlane ahead over the next 8 minutes. Although, my team was horrible and Xayah was dead weight, Riven was trading kills and increasing the strength of the enemy Tristana, and our jungler was trolling (32% kill participation on a jungler).\n\nMy teams average kda was 3.17 (not including me).\n\nThe enemy teams average kda was 3.2 (not including enemy mid).\n\nMy teams average kda was 4.27 (including me)\n\nThe enemy teams average kda was 2.96 (including enemy mid)\n\nOur top was slightly better than their top, but made the game harder due to dying 11 times to the enemy tops 9. \n\nOur jungler had a decent KDA due to not doing anything thus he didn't die much.\n\nMy adc went 1/12, their adc went 16/6.\n\nBoth supports played well, our support did better KDA wise due to me. \n\nIf teams matter so much when it comes to winning, why can I do that?\n\nRiven had the 2nd highest damage in our team with 24,989 damage over the course of the game (583 damage per minute)\n\nThe enemies team 3rd highest damage was Ezreal with 22,281 (520 damage per minute), 2nd highest was Malzahar with 28,815 (673 damage per minute) and 1st highest was Tristana with 39,187 (915 damage per minute).\n\nI dealt 61,395 (1450 damage per minute).\n\nSmurfs are able to do this, your team doesn't matter most of the time. Your statistics are inaccurate. Getting lucky with teams doesn't make people climb. It's skill, it's them being able to be individually great and allowing their teams to be great with them, even in circumstances like the game I pointed out, my team was still worse than the opponents even when I had gone 19/3. If I was 0/0 the kda difference would have been SUBSTANTIALLY greater to the enemy.\n\nEven if to you, that game is an outlier. HOW CAN THAT EVER HAPPEN? If I can do that then, it means I could have the ability to do that again. If being lucky with teams means so much in climbing how come that even with HORRIBLE teams people like me can still carry them 1v9?\n\nWhitepumah, tell me why I am wrong in all of my main points. Don't dodge my points. Go for my strongest arguments and take them down, that is how you win arguments and gain the logical upper hand. Otherwise, it will be proven that I am right, and you are wrong. Explain them all. If your argument is so strong you should be able to PROVE me wrong. Do it. \n\nGood luck.\n\n\n","replies":[]},{"poster":"SOOM","date":"2017-10-26T22:58:56.700+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"This guy has listed heaps of important factors which lead to winning and its not luck....\nstop ignoring things and stop being ignorant.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Transcender","date":"2017-10-31T02:45:41.923+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=ThatsSoLiam,realm=OCE,application-id=mR0UmRrp,discussion-id=FpEz9whO,comment-id=00000000000000000000000100000000000000010000000000000006,timestamp=2017-10-29T09:37:20.125+0000)\n> \n> but you play a lot of ranked, and you also have game streaks like [this](https://imgur.com/a/yKdu9)\n> \n> Your stats just show how 1-dimensional you are.

It is not after 100 games you will be at your elo, that suggests that luck doesnt exist. Same will be said for if you play 1000 games you will be at your elo, that suggests luck doesnt exist.\n\n>Answer this, why do boosting companies exist and thrive? They can consistently climb accounts fast no matter the division, mmr or role (excluding support) and are able to effectively have amazing teams over thousands of games played between them weekly. It's a statistical improbability that they're just lucky every single time.\n\nFirst of all they don't have all amazing teams. They have balanced teams on average, some will be bad, some will be good, their ability will determine the speed they climb or fall at but that is on average, let me repeat, ON AVERAGE. That is how averages work, and that is also how luck works, the majority of the time they will be able to easily climb ON AVERAGE. just because it seems like a statistical improbability, doesn't mean it can't happen and would they give away information such as, not being able to boost a player. This is why I am asking you to provide evidence that disproves the luck aspect, because unless you are telling me that the most basic mathematical elements do not apply to this matchmaking system, then logically the only alternative is that my account is a statistical anomaly that must be accepted and treated as such.\n\n>Yeah, this one completely disproves you. If they failed to meet standard, they wouldn't make money, thus they wouldn't exist. The players don't often duo queue, and there are generally things such as 1 division per day speeds they need to keep to, which they do. \n\nDo you even know what you are trying to disprove? You are claiming luck does not exist in the matchmaking system, but what you have tried to use as proof lines up just fine with my point. Luck means chance, and \"when you have eliminated the impossible, whatever remains, however improbable, must be the truth.\"\n\n> How did I win when literally only Lulu - the support - played well on my team?\n\nYou realise both your jungler and top laner went positive right?\n\nAre you really trying to bait me out into posting MY damage dealt relative to my team? Are we really going to go there? Because that is not an accurate representation of performance even for a carry in a game. Objectives do not count as damage dealt. But if you are seriously inviting me to a damage dealt contest.. I don't have absolutely any reason to back down on this one.\n\n> I dealt 1450 damage per minute in a game where we were losing the entire time.\n> Even if to you, that game is an outlier.

That would mean that these two divisions, and even lower gold have the most players in them. This means a greater division in player skill. There are more people, this means that there must be a larger quantity of skilled/unskilled players. So let's say, there are 100 players in Bronze/Silver/Gold. Of these 100 players, 20 are excellent players - soon to be plat/diamond. 40 are average players, deserving a spot in Gold. and 40 are unskilled players.\nThis means that you have a 40% chance of getting a terrible player. a 20% chance of getting an amazing player, and 40% chance of getting an average joe! This means, an average team comp would be - 1 amazing player, 2 average players, and 2 awful players. If both teams have this exact chance, then sure it comes down to whichever team is more skilled, or more so, which 'amazing' player is better.\nThat's not how chance works though. You could just as easily get 3 awful players, and 1 average player, and 1 amazing player. What if this amazing player is support? What if the enemy gets 3 amazing players, and 2 awful players. Their amazing players take the roles of jungle/top/mid.\nYou are screwed.\nThis is where luck comes into it, especially in the lower divisions, and probably mostly in Silver - as this is where the majority of players reside. Whichever team is dished out the better players - wins.\nI know mmr affects these statistics - but mmr is not dictated by individual performance, it is dictated by wins/losses. That means, it is as much a victim to chance as your team comp is.\nThis argument doesn't hold up in higher elo. Here's why. We've said there are 100 players in bronze/silver/gold. Now let's say due to the nature of the ranked system, there are 10 players in Plat/Diamond.\nOf these 10 players, 6 really deserve to be there. 4 are average, but have risen the ranks due to lucky streaks of getting superior players on their team. This means that you have a 60% chance of getting an amazing player and a 40% chance of getting an average player. This means your average team comp is 3 amazing players and 2 average. This is where games truly become about skill. And this is where YOU truly make a difference. At this level the skill divide between players are greatly reduced - this means that teams are usually facing off against each other on level ground - it becomes more about skill and less about chance.\nI think it is for this reason that you usually see players in Plat/Diamond refusing to accept that luck is any part of it. Because for them, at their elo, it mostly isn't.\nFor the majority of the population in the lower divisions however, luck is a HUGE factor in games. I don't care how good you are, if you get 20 games in a row where the other 4 players on your team are straight up terrible - you will not climb.\n_______________________________\n> I have only ever not done absolutely everything I could to win a game ONCE, and that was going to be a test for how far I could go down in MMR and then how it affected going back up relative to league and MMR.

The only times you would need to 1v9 is generally when top, jungle and mid lose which is 12.5% of the time. Of course you would have the off game where your team plays like monkeys even when playing decently in the lane, but so do you. For all the games where your team play like monkeys and die at important times, the enemy team would have that as well. If you are good though, you can still _easily_ win with players like that. That is why you are gold. When you can only play 1 champ, with 1 style, you will fail when  you don't get it because your fundamental play is lackluster. \n\n>I guess they purposely have long drawn out fights with someone who has full offensive runes, clearly missing 90% of their attacks and flashing under my tower right?\nA good player will know that he has to provide pressure on the map when he is behind in order to keep the enemy from making use of their advantage in numbers.

It also makes YOU weaker because now your champion is in limbo not pressuring, farming and gaining gold/exp, not warding, helping the team etc. Dying is a very, very bad thing. The only times it is worth while is if you steal baron, kill 3-4 people for it etc. When you go 1/15, I doubt that you are dying for good reasons.

Nah, the Corki that saved countless teamfights, stopped the enemies from cracking our base and taking our inhibitors 1v4, stopped the incredibly fed Tristana every team fight, output so much poke the enemy team couldn&#x27;t even go near the Corki, whilst only dying 3 times. \n> \n> The Corki got carried XD\n\nI just want to point out some fun little facts I looked into whilst analysing each frame of that game on the lol match history:\n\nThe riven had higher gold than you did all the way up until the 18 min mark.\n\nThe riven took her first tower at 6:11\n\nkhazix gets the infernal at around 8\n\nkhazix took the tier 2 tower at 10:53\n\nkhazix took your mid lane tier 1 tower at 11:38\n\nkhazix got the 2nd infernal at around 15\n\nlulu got her tier 1 bot tower at 15:03\n\nkhazix gets rift scuttler at around 17\n\nkhazix got bot lane tier 2 tower at 19:03\n\nkhazix got your mid lane tier 2 tower at 22:31\n\nxayah gets mountain at around 27\n\nkhazix takes bot lane inhib at around 29\n\nriven gets 3rd infernal at around 35\n\nriven gets top tier 3 at 39:04\n\nriven gets top lane inhib at 39:09\n\nwhile\n\nkhazix gets bot lane inhib at 39:11\n\nOHH... WAIT HERE YOU ARE: Corki the god who is getting all the kills and taking all the objectives on the map 1v9 like the god he is, while his khazix afk farms and riven and xayah feeds the enemy to the point where only a god could stop them, gets the elder dragon at around 41 and amazingly, somehow, through ALL possible odds manages to 1v9 and kill 4 enemies gets 1 of 2 nexus towers and ends the game!\n\nWhat a spectacular performance by the corki, report that khazix and riven and xayah as clearly they did nothing all game but intentionally feed and afk.\n\n> Players you perceive are bad are not bad, they are horrible. \n\nWell it is about time you got something right. What I experience as a bad teammate, to you would be a living nightmare that would haunt you for the rest of your life. What you consider a bad teammate is something I only hear in folktales and long for the sweet decadence of performance that is from having the correct amount of chromosomes.\n\n> You are bad, the players equal to you are bad.\n\nTherefore my performance should be equal to the average of players I play with and against but you implied that I only have a better score because I vs players who are bad which is implying I am better than them, which implies that I am better than my rank, which implies that you are wrong about the perspective you have been terribly failing at trying to prove this entire time. So can you please stop contradicting yourself?","replies":[{"poster":"ThatsSoLiam","date":"2017-11-03T03:27:08.010+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":">I just want to point out some fun little facts I looked into whilst analysing each frame of that game on the lol match history:\nThe riven had higher gold than you did all the way up until the 18 min mark.\nThe riven took her first tower at 6:11\n\nHer early game was good, she got first blood off an invade and proceeded to snowball. Our top was winning early, jg was ahead (due to me shutting down enemy jungler), I was ahead, bot was feeding. \n\nBut, the early game is not everything in a game. From the 22 minute mark to the 34, she died 4 times in a row, she then proceeded to trade with the weakest person in the enemy team, and then die 2 mores times additionally in a row and that was her game (whilst she was dying I got an unofficial pentakill (in base defense due to her) and a quadra.) Our team went from 9.1k gold lead to 1.1k nearly entire due to her. Her dying gave the enemy team baron **TWICE** and pressure and allowed them to come back.\n\nFor the rest. It's not like they were the ones to make the call and the ones to solo the objective. I was there for most of it pressuring and poking down the enemy so the fed Tristana and the Kennen/Ezreal/Malz/Nami couldn't pick/burst us. If I didn't help my team we wouldn't have achieved half the shit we did and my team would have had A LOT more deaths, in fact, we would have EASILY lost the game. \n\nDo you know why my team didn't get punished for taking turrets etc? (apart from obvious instances when they suicided)\n\nBecause I dealt 51% of my teams damage.\n\nWhat could the enemy do to my team if I'm absolutely destroying them by my self when they come near? Imagine if I had 28% of the damage share (avg 2015 lcs mid laner share, couldn't find more recent statistics, most played champions were Azir/Ryze/Viktor, ranged mages)\n\nIf I did 28%, even 35% or so, we would have lost the game. \n\nIf I didn't output that much pressure and have massive teamfights (like stopping the baron'd up enemy team from taking our 2nd inhibitor by way of unofficial pentakill) we would have lost the game.\n\n>What a spectacular performance by the corki, report that khazix and riven and xayah as clearly they did nothing all game but intentionally feed and afk.\n\nThe good outweighed the bad by a large margin. I would say KhaZix played decently but considering he was shit talking and griefing by stealing lane cs early on, taking all buffs and baiting in our team to die, I don't think he was decent. \n\nRivens early game helped us a lot but she effectively inted and nearly lost us the game by literally going like 1/7 after 24 minute mark and losing us baron twice. \n\nI really don't need to say much about Xayah, do I?\n\n>Therefore my performance should be equal to the average of players I play with and against but you implied that I only have a better score because I vs players who are bad which is implying I am better than them, which implies that I am better than my rank, which implies that you are wrong about the perspective you have been terribly failing at trying to prove this entire time. So can you please stop contradicting yourself?\n\nYou are better than your rank, on Twitch, I never said in general. That is why your Twitch winrate is 60% and your total ranked win ratio is 51%, you can only play Twitch with one specific style. Hypothetically, if you had only played Twitch and he was never banned ever and you always got him you would be above your current Gold IV. But since you can only play Twitch and you suck horribly on anybody else, you cannot climb well. I honestly encourage you to try to get better the game. Watch the videos and try, to see how it affects you. Like, on Twitch you're pretty good, but you lack fundamentals and understanding.\n\nStop blaming the system and others for your own weakness. Over 13 games I am 11/2 on this account against high golds/plats and I'm not even that good.
