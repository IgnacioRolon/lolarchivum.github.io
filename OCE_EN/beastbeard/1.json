Most of them won 1 out on 10.. \r\nWell the ranking system put them to either bronze 1 or silver 5 but not bronze 2 or lower and there KDA&#039;s weren&#039;t as good. Somehow they got S5 or B1...\r\nI think they should change the ranking system even though it helps low skilled players..\r\nThanks","replies":[{"poster":"CHEESYLEEKS","date":"2016-01-07T09:58:19.331+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I remember I played my 10 games and on the 10th game I was like I'm bronze 5 for sure\nSilver 4 lol","replies":[]},{"poster":"Imasukai","date":"2016-01-07T08:54:21.514+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I've noticed pre-season always seems to be a little fairer on people. They'll be soft reset when season starts anyway, so they'll have to place again, and if they do the same thing, they'll almost definitely hit the bottom of bronze.","replies":[]}]}
