If you got that score in mid, top or jg with vayne it would most likely have been a definite S or S+, I would imagine.\nSeems to me like they base your score off the generic meta for that specific champ. You play a champ where they are usually played, you gotta be perfect for a perfect score.\nYou play a champ in an off role, it's seen as a harder feat therefore a decent score reflects the difficulty you should have had for that game.\n\nSide note, some good games you've had there. I could only dream of achieving 40 kills in a single game haha","replies":[{"poster":"Schlossberg","date":"2016-07-30T09:28:39.144+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yeah I have been Vayne in the top lane alot recently. \nThe game was weird their bot wasn't very good in learning from their mistakes..","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Nightjar","date":"2016-07-26T13:39:02.413+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"from what I've observed farming S's recently for higher mastery and hextech, getting S's is easier in normals and is mostly decided by 3 factors, the % of the total kills on your team that you have, the number of deaths you have (try to keep this to at most 1) and your cs (especially if you are support for some reason).\n\nif you want S's my advice is to make sure you take all the kills you can unless you are sup with the changes (in which case just take 4+2*(#deaths) kills ) and at the very least have an assist for 3/4's of your teams kills. Also try to have at least 140cs in a 20min game, 180cs in a 30min and 200cs in a 40min. If you are sup have at least half this number too.\nThis seems to be sufficient to get an S with basically any champion and basically involves alot of being a selfish asshole and not caring for your teammates. I'd advise you pair up with someone who is really low elo or unranked and enter normals as a duo though since this will make the enemies easy to wail on and it's not as bad to be selfish at this level since bad players expect this sort of stuff and probably won't report you for being selfish. Also at this level if you ks alot; so long as you carry hard (and seeing those scores I'd imagine you would) they won't begrudge you too much if you are friendly in chat.","replies":[{"poster":"Schlossberg","date":"2016-07-30T09:29:57.924+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thanks a lot for this.
