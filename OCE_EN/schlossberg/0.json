They are good computers and will definitely last you forever (mine is a 2010 and i basically never changed anything in it, still rocks), but if all you need is gaming you're better off with a cheapo that you can customise to your liking. Just stay away from Dell*.\n\nThat said, if you get one you can expect a high variation of FPS depending on the desired graphic quality. On a 2010, i range from 30 (very high) to 70+ (mid-low), so i'd expect you'd be a tad above that.\n\n* *residual of a long, stressful conversation i had with them trough lawyer.*","replies":[{"poster":"Schlossberg","date":"2015-08-31T09:06:05.870+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thanks","replies":[{"poster":"Ediwir","date":"2015-08-31T11:46:50.826+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Too easy man.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Schlossberg","date":"2015-08-31T09:05:59.903+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I need a lightweight laptop.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"See Me Fail","date":"2015-08-30T13:16:30.211+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'm using a 13' macbook air and can play smoothly without skipping or frame loss on normal - high quality.
