Our time was short but I suppose all good things come to an end, sadly I don't think as much as we protest to save GD, I honestly think we all know it wont happen no matter how hard we try.  My favourite thread was:\n\nhttp://forums.oce.leagueoflegends.com/board/showthread.php?t=82848&page=1\n\nMainly because it had everything inside which represented our forum, it was a random thread which took off, It had some flaming, some great jokes (http://forums.oce.leagueoflegends.com/board/showthread.php?t=82848&page=24) <-- Made me laugh so hard when I saw that Pic, and alot of really personal things/views we shared and we actually constructively discussed and respected. We were 90% talk talk, but did have that 10% of personal talk.\n\nI must admit I really did enjoy reading all your guys threads and comments, we were a small forum so we pretty much knew all the regualrs which made it really have that homey feel. I'll come back to GD and read some of the old posts we made and have a good chuckle, it's wont be the same here, and we will slowly drop off this forum one by one,  we wern't a perfect forum but to me it was my favourite. I don't usually make any serious threads (if any) but I just want to say thanks to everyone in GD community for everything, you guys were great :')","replies":[{"poster":"Rav","date":"2014-11-20T14:35:18.945+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Best part is I can't even click on those links because I'm permabanned.\n\nRacist Riot.","replies":[]}]}
