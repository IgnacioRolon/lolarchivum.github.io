Anything below this (regardless of lane events like ganks), you should probably practice on becoming consistent. \n\nBy 20 minutes ~234 is the max CS. Similarly to above, you should be aiming for at least 60% (140), or maybe a little bit higher as it becomes easier to farm when you have items behind you. \n\nFollow these basic numbers, and it's one of the things that is good to be able to pull of consistently to get out of bronze.\n\nLike Cakemeisting mentioned, the best score you can actually have is one that puts you at a CS advantage above your opponent. You will always have the upper hand in items, making it easier for you to trade in lane as well as snowball (which really demoralises enemy players). There are a number of smaller skills that you can practice that will aid in this. \n\n* Learn how to [trade successfully and to deny minions](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iko2tqmDpJQ&list=PL9RdXhXESRJzgY_SwHB8T-cZxXljWhQvz) (watch all vids in the series)\n* Generally keep up with the [CS training](http://imgur.com/orWUCKH) (even just as a 5 minute warmup, before you play a game and track your progress)\n* Learning wave manipulations so you can know when to push and when to freeze (and how to as well), and what will screw your enemy over the most.

But some people seem to aim that \"100 cs per 10 min\" rule. But hey, up to you I suppose.\n\nYou want to maximise your chances of winning, and keeping your cs high is definitely one sure way to approach it, but there is no rule for what cs you should have at a certain point of the game as there are too many variables in play. So really just take a rough range in which you're comfortable with and push yourself to get some cs from time to time, as long as your cs is more than your opponent (or if you have kills to make up for it), it's good cs I say.\n\nI won't worry too much about the number itself.","replies":[]}]}
