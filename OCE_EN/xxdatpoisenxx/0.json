Depending on where you play and what you're doing. The maximum you can get from minions alone at 10 mins is 119cs, and again much more at 20 because minions don't spawn right away.  So yeah 170-180 at 20 mins is decent and good enough for silver but can be much higher. But its not realistic to have perfect cs, which is why i say aiming for 90 at 10 mins is perfect without being perfect, if that makes sense.","replies":[]},{"poster":"JasonWazza","date":"2018-02-13T00:28:31.159+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"A) don't lie to yourself, a quick check of your account says otherwise.\nB) the reason CS is good, is because it enables you to get items and be in a better position then your opponent, if you are up in CS consistently and are climbing, then the sky is the limit, CSing is an enabler, not an indicator.\nC) CSing well when losing is more important then when you are winning.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2018-02-13T00:22:35.178+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I mean for high gold level I was always told that matching the minutes is good (and consistent CS), so 100 at 10 mins, 200 at 20 and so on and so forth. Of course that muddies early and then again later in the game. I'm also a support main and am trash at csing so take that with a grain of salt I suppose :)","replies":[]}]}
