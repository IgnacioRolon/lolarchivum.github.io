Which is one of the key things of the game that might attract people and might be what Riot Games wants to keep the game as. Kind of like Smite and Paladins. It kinda sucks that you have to pay online to play multiplayer, but then those game's servers are seperate to the pc ones. (I think)\n\nBut on the other hand if the game didnt require a Live Gold subscription, I guess people who use the xbox might start complaining that because League of Legends doesn't need a Live subscription, why should SMITE, Paladins etc need it.","replies":[{"poster":"Poucas Trancas 1","date":"2017-10-25T09:38:35.238+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yeah, about this free to play methodology you are right. But as I pay live gold every year, it wouldn't be an issue for me.\nIn this case you would have the choice of playing or not, live gold is a subscription that is more than just enabling you to play online games, this thing goes beyond. \nPhil Spencer wants everything to be a cross-platform btw, I do not see a issue between both companies, after all it is a win win.","replies":[{"poster":"koreoes","date":"2017-10-26T09:50:22.479+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"That's a possibility as well, it will all depend on the demand from the people that would like it and out of those people who would want to pay to play League as well as capabilities of League with the current tech Riot has.\n\nIt would be a huge step for Riot Games though, could earn a lot of money and players but with that comes another whole platform to support. They'd probably have to set another whole team or something to deal with the XBOX platform and its players. It'd be pretty interesting to see though!\n\nThe people who don't have as capable computers but have an Xbox would benefit the most from it I'm guessing.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Aaron Sorenson","date":"2018-04-04T20:23:09.216+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Why not PUBG did it, free on PC and cost on XBOX.
