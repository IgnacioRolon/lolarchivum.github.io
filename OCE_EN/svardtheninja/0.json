Favorite top laner?","subforum":"Miscellaneous","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"hey guys this is my first post ever... i think, but i wanted to get ur guys takes on top lane who is your favorite champion at the top lane? currently im sitting on the most played and wins of poppy and well i find that shes a great champion but against certain people its hard to farm... so i remembered jayce can change from ranged to melee. This instantly made me think well maybe it could be the best farming solution to laning at top against almost anyone. But still id like to know what you guys think or what you think is the best champion top please try to avoid adding jax we all know hes a powerhouse.","replies":[{"poster":"Bambooze","date":"2016-01-19T11:35:13.775+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Gnar can be good.
