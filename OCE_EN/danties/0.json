No ping spikes, no lag, no indication that anything was wrong with my internet, my PC or the RIOT servers. Suddenly my game froze and I got an attempting to reconnect screen. Assuming it was a problem on my end I looked for a fix but nothing was wrong, I closed my game to try and reload to see if that could fix it and now I can&#039;t reconnect. My client window is normal and lets me queue as normal but if I search on lolnexus my game still exists.\r\nI don&#039;t really feel like getting a free random loss and 4-9x reported for something out of my control.\r\nHelp? lol.\r\n\r\n(I has just played an URF game before this and everything was fine. The game I&#039;m unable to reconnect to is also not in my match history)","replies":[{"poster":"         Swhyper","date":"2017-08-14T07:56:13.376+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey there,\n\nSeems like the issue occurred during when you're in-game. Since this is a disconnection problem, it's most likely that your current DNS server isn't reaching Riot's preferred DNS (Google DNS).  Please follow these steps: \n\nStep 1. First of all, in your windows PC go to the Control Panel and select Network and sharing center.\n\nStep 2. And there click on Change adapter settings.\n\nStep 3. Now there you will see all networks, select the network that you want to configure for Google DNS.\n\nIf you have decided to try out Google’s DNS and want to change ethernet settings then simply right-click on Local Area Connection and then select Properties.\n\nStep 4. Now click on Networking tab and there under This connection uses the following items select the option Internet Protocol Version 4 (TCP/IPv4) and then click on properties.\n\nStep 5. Now choose the radio button Use the following DNS server addresses there and there will be written some default IP, simply clear them. Now there fill the value of google DNS value that is 8.8.8.8 OR 8.8.4.4 and then simply click on “OK” and then restart your network/computer.\n\nPlease let me know if you're still experiencing this issue. :D. \n\nThanks\nSwhyper","replies":[]},{"poster":"Agent Kitty","date":"2017-08-12T09:52:24.113+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Just had the same thing happen, so bizarre, we were winning as well :(","replies":[]}]}
