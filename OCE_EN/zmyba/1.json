This could be your modem dropping out, your ISP having a minor \"blip\" in their network (or any network they cross between).\n\nIf this continues to happen, please head over to http://oce.leagueoflegends.com/tools/network-logs and follow the steps there to reun a diagnostic report and send the results to ocelivereports@riotgames.com.\n\nWe can then look into your ISP and see if there is something we can do with them to help improve the connection for you.\n\n-ToxicHawk","replies":[]}]}
