Some concerns were raised in the twitch chat of the OUC stream that the skill gap between some of the teams was pretty unfair. Some reasons people raised were that only one team from each region was allowed to compete. I didn&#039;t read the leadup to this event so I have no idea myself.\n\nPersonally, IDGAF it&#039;s been fun to watch so far. Although it is jarring to me to spy on the players runes and see that on one team we have multiple very high ranked players with 12-15 full rune pages and on the other we have guys who still use tier 2 runes.\n\nAnyway, what&#039;s everyone else think?","replies":[{"poster":"JasonWazza","date":"2015-08-22T07:02:59.446+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":">and on the other we have guys who still use tier 2 runes.\n\nThat makes me laugh, and is really just pathetic if accurate.","replies":[{"poster":"Billos","date":"2015-08-22T07:24:46.853+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yeah unfortunately its true.
