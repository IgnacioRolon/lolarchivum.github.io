Wards have been removed and there&#039;s his whole new rune system. I read on a LoL post that the devs were changing some stuff with support items. As such, I&#039;m a little confused about how to properly play Support now without wards. I&#039;m somewhat nervous about just hopping onto a game blindly and having some folks be mad that I don&#039;t know the new ropes. \r\n\r\nAre there other items to substitute? Or perhaps is there another method of putting wards? I remember reading on that post that wards were becoming &#039;passive&#039; or something of the sort? Would someone care to explain how supports work now?\r\n\r\nMany thanks.","replies":[{"poster":"Wyldfyre","date":"2018-02-15T13:50:26.369+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Generally as support you will start with a gold generating item which after you have earned 500 gold through the item it will passively upgrade to allow ward placements like the old sight stone. The base item you buy will depend on what character you play as support, the three items are spellthief's edge, relic shield and ancient coin!\nSpellthief's are for ap supports, relic shield for tanks and ancient coin is for any support. \n\nTank supports seem to be very strong right now but having knowledge of all the characters will help. \nTry to always keep a pink ward up on the map.\n\nI am only a silver player but enjoy supporting and the way it allows you to control the game so good luck with coming back.","replies":[{"poster":"TheIceDancer","date":"2018-02-16T01:58:17.221+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I see, so the starting items have now gained the Sightward Passive.
