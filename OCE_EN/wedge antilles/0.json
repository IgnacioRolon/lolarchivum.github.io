You can read more about lever buster [HERE](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752714-LeaverBuster-FAQ#h1q2)\n\nTo indefinitely avoid players leaving your games, i would suggest creating/joining a premade team. On top of avoiding lagging/afk players, you also minimise general toxicity, and can make friends. You also get extra IP, master points and an increased chance of hextech loot :D","replies":[]}]}
