I find maxing W and rushing Lich Bane and either Zonya's or Deathcap i can do some extreme damage its just his Q is pretty weak but not that bad.","replies":[{"poster":"nz knifer","date":"2015-03-15T11:03:29.062+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"yah but if you were to lane with him what items would you rush first? because he doesn't have alot of damage. iv been playing him support because of his cc and ult but its hard to make good trades","replies":[{"poster":"Fatmike","date":"2015-03-15T17:00:11.520+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Normally if its a melee match up id still max W and go lich bane, but if im relying on Q poke damage id go morello's. I also like tanky support gragas its good against a leona or braum but if you get a poke support theres not much you can do but peel.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"TouchMyKimchi","date":"2015-03-14T23:40:01.963+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Me thinks, change her passive to fire from her plant on a decent CD and maybe less dmg.
