As it is now groups match with solo players of higher mmr.\n\nREMOVE ROLES FROM MATCHMAKING EQUATION AGAIN WHILE STILL LETTING PLAYERS PICK ROLES. HOW? READ ON!\n\nOnce teams are matched, players have 30 seconds to pick three roles (or fill) in order of preference. This happens once you are in champion select, and your selection is hidden from other players until the 30 second period is over. If you do not select your roles the system will put fill as your preference.\n\nFrom here there are two options:\n1. Roles are decided based off the first in best dressed method - basically what happened between players in the old system\n2. (This is better) a program works out the best way for everyone to get a role that they are happy with.\nThen go into the game :D\n\nThis solution is aimed at reducing Queue times while still allowing for role selection. Queue times should be drastically lower and role preference (while not top two) will still be considered.\n\nTl;dr\n- New Matchmaking system that solves all discussed issues\n1. Search for players BEFORE selecting roles\n2. In champ select players have 30 seconds to select top three roles, in order of preference\n3. A program works out a way for everyone to get one of their preferred roles if possible\n4. Go into game and enjoy a much faster queue time\n\nThankyou","replies":[{"poster":"Main Line","date":"2016-06-11T12:57:42.020+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"So simple and easy to program.\n\nJust do it Riot.","replies":[]}]}
