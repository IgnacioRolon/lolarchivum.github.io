There is no drop-down box at Recommended. I created the sets on the same PC as I&#039;m using, one day ago. Made a new one specifically to test before a new game, set just to Braum for all maps....played Braum. Doesn&#039;t show up.\r\n\r\nHalf a dozen games since making them, the sets are definitely still there, but they don&#039;t show up in game.","replies":[{"poster":"HORSE OF FORCE","date":"2015-06-22T08:07:26.202+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":">the sets are definitely still there\n\nHave you tried navigating to the folder they're saved to to see if they're still there?
