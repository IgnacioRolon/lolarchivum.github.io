Now, because they D/C&#039;d after already connecting, we could not remake, and so spend a grueling 15 min waiting to FF a brutal game. It was a waste of my valuable weekend, I work as a doctor, and hardly ever get enough time off for this type of thing. \r\nI think the game mechanics need to change in order to correct this. \r\nHere is my proposed fix:\r\n\r\nif a player D/C&#039;s at any point BEFORE 5 min, a system vote goes out to all allied players whereby the majority can all vote to end the match. If this does happen, the D/C champion gets penalised HARD (ie -50 LP for example) in order to prevent intentional D/Cs. It shouldn&#039;t matter if the player has initially loaded in or not. \r\n\r\nNow some might argue, oh but what about connection issues? - tough, either sort the connection or don&#039;t play ranked, it really should be simple as that.","replies":[{"poster":"JasonWazza","date":"2017-11-05T10:29:24.271+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":">I played a game today where our mid-laner disconnected 10 seconds after arriving onto the Rift.\n\nSorry bud but that isn't how the system works.\n\nIf a player is deemed AFK at any point before 1:30 (till 3 minutes)/before a kill is gotten, a remake is available.","replies":[{"poster":"Best Evelynn OCE","date":"2017-11-05T21:37:56.898+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"^ Agreed","replies":[{"poster":"Nightjar","date":"2017-11-06T01:58:28.103+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"it's sadder when you join back in after client crashes, jungle camps haven't even spawned and you'd only be a little late getting to toplane, where you're certain you'd still be fine, but you're confronted with the option to cast the 5th green vote, for a remake, where declining wouldn't even matter.","replies":[{"poster":"JasonWazza","date":"2017-11-06T03:13:54.370+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":">jungle camps haven't even spawned\n\nAlso not possible, remakes are only possible at 3 minutes.","replies":[{"poster":"Nightjar","date":"2017-11-06T10:08:55.518+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"this was a while ago, before the remake timer was moved back.","replies":[{"poster":"JasonWazza","date":"2017-11-06T11:05:06.996+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Since when was it moved \"back\"?\n\nhttps://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/208754686--Remake-FAQ\n\nThis shows it still at 3 minutes, and i swear i had one at 3 minutes not even that long ago.","replies":[{"poster":"Nightjar","date":"2017-11-06T11:28:19.287+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"no I mean back when they were testing remake.
