But i got to thinking when i saw CRITICAL DAMAGE runes. when i first saw them i wanted to create a full page of them. but after a search abit i read that APPARENTLY! when it comes to the math typical runes like attack speed/attack dmg runes are better for trynd. I DONT KNOW IF THAT IS TRUE?? i know crits scale off ad but in my build i have for trynd i can max attack speed easily (guinsoo&#039;s rage blade {{item:3124}}). so no need for attack speed i thought but im considering scrapping the attack damage and armor runes left?\n\nWould it be worth it to spend the amount of ip these ridiculously priced runes are (crit dmg runes) for a full page of them?? will they even be better then just normal runes for trynd? i want all factors considered EARLY , MID and LATE game! i imagine they would only be better late game right? but this is just a maths thing now and id really like to hear that these runes can be used! please help and thank you! :)","replies":[{"poster":"wonkey donkey","date":"2016-02-09T11:10:01.684+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I used to main tryn I tried that out for awile to because I thought would be very strong but it limits his early game so much I think a lot more reliable using normal ad runes far stronger early game a lot bigger chance of snowballing and dumb as this sounds if the matchup is vs somebody I know is very very hard I run flat armour/mr runes makes laneing 100% easier a lot harder for them to bully you and deny cs","replies":[]},{"poster":"DragonOfTheVoid","date":"2016-02-07T09:14:59.560+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I have played trindmon for a few years now if you just get {{item:3031}} {{item:1001}} {{item:3812}} {{item:1325}} {{item:3071}} {{item:3153}} {{item:3508}} you have 40% cd a lot of life steal crit is 90% and no one can out run you if you hit them 1 time","replies":[{"poster":"GigaPube","date":"2016-02-07T22:52:02.602+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=snakeowen,realm=OCE,application-id=FjGAIbRv,discussion-id=il3noA6J,comment-id=0000,timestamp=2016-02-07T09:14:59.560+0000)\n>\n>{{item:3508}} \n......\nis this even trolling.....","replies":[{"poster":"DragonOfTheVoid","date":"2016-02-09T09:55:08.739+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"trindmon op atm cos its a assassin meta and if he gets r off faster then you can qwrrewqrwereedrq he wins","replies":[]},{"poster":"DragonOfTheVoid","date":"2016-02-09T09:53:55.561+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"no troll try it before you nuke it","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"UnusualSUK","date":"2016-02-07T09:50:37.727+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"im talking about runes but thanks for that item set","replies":[{"poster":"DragonOfTheVoid","date":"2016-02-07T10:09:57.668+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"you don't need runes on trindmon he op no matter what you do","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Mauradon","date":"2016-02-08T06:44:55.568+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Attack Speed / AD gives you a stronger early game so you can snowball whereas crit dmg is only useful later and even then its not amazing \n\nalso only rush guinsoos vs tank champs botrk is better otherwise imo","replies":[]},{"poster":"GigaPube","date":"2016-02-07T22:54:51.709+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"crit damage is worthless until late game, so unless your opponent is bad, play passively and dont over commit for kills cos if it backfires you're even further behind","replies":[{"poster":"UnusualSUK","date":"2016-02-08T04:10:55.242+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"thats great to hear! i believe i can take trynd into late game.. which then meaning these runes would be much better! right? :o","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"VeganCrossfitter","date":"2016-02-07T12:01:49.665+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"If you have the ip, its worth a shot, but its a big investment for just one champ when his normal ones are pretty solid as is","replies":[]}]}
