I have had issues with my client for a while now, but this update the client as it is scanning for files, an error comes up stopping the update. Because of this I decided to delete the league of legends folder and add an older client I had from a portable hardrive. Unfortunately it refuses to delete the folder as it says &quot;Unable to delete as it is in use&quot;. \r\nI have restarted my computer, and I have checked the task manager and there are no signs of the folder being used. Because of this I am having to run the game from a portable hardrive but would love to delete the game so I am able to reinstall it to remove all of these issues I am having.\r\n\r\nCheers guys.","replies":[{"poster":"Mindstar","date":"2015-09-08T02:43:01.162+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hi ncox,\n\nCheck out the [Reinstalling League of Legends](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/202539040-Reinstalling-League-of-Legends) steps - there might be a couple of steps in there that you need to do to get rid of everything.\n\nCheers\nMindstar","replies":[{"poster":"ncox","date":"2015-09-08T06:25:00.120+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I have tried this, using control panel to uninstall.

There could be any number of things on your PC that might be preventing you from deleting it so here are a couple of suggestions I can think of to help you investigate further:\n\n* Log in as as an administrator to delete the folder\n* Try out a tool like [process explorer](https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/bb896653.aspx), \n * search for the League path by clicking \"Find\" -> \"Find handle/dll\" and type the folder path (eg: \"C:\\Riot Games\\\") \n * The resulting list should show you which processes are accessing files in that path.\n* Boot into windows [safe mode](http://windows.microsoft.com/en-au/windows/start-computer-safe-mode#start-computer-safe-mode=windows-7) and try deleting the folder from there.\n\nLet me know how you go or if you have any other questions.\n\nCheers\nMindstar","replies":[{"poster":"ncox","date":"2015-09-10T13:20:37.321+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Already logged in as administrator that unfortunately didn't work.\nNo Riot games folder in the C drive, have it on my desktop.\nSafe mode wont allow it to be deleted either. \nThanks","replies":[{"poster":"Mindstar","date":"2015-09-11T05:37:09.569+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Sorry perhaps I wasn't quite clear above.\nYou should use process explorer to examine the folder you're trying to delete.  That will tell you what process is using a file underneath that path.\n\nIn your case, the path you would search for, using process explorer would be something similar to\n\"C:\\users\\YOUR-USERNAME\\desktop\\LEAGUE-FOLDER-NAME\"   (replace the caps with the correct names)\n\nIf this doesn't turn up anything, I'd strongly suggest sending in a ticket to player support, as they have tech specialists who will be able to help you way better than I can.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]}
