I was thinking having a Summer , Autumn and Winter map to keep Summoners Rift fresh. Imaging this, riot using the winter map when winter starts in real life, or an Autumn map in the beginning of the actual month autumn starts.I just feel like summoners lift is stuck in one season and I think season cycling in Summoners rift would make the game that much better.\r\nCheers, \r\nLoL Addict","replies":[{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2015-09-13T13:54:21.675+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Well I imagine it would take them a lot of work that they may be unwilling to do but, certainly it's not like seasonal stuff that gets used for a little while then goes away so it would be a long term thing. I honestly think it would be very interesting, and hey, they made a whole new ARAM map just for the Bilgewater event.","replies":[]}]}
