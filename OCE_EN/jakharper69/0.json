Once he hits 30s, it will be quicker. But, LoL is trying to find other newer players that are duo'd with more tactical players.","replies":[]},{"poster":"JakHarper69","date":"2018-06-28T04:17:47.252+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"we also tried ARURF late last night but only got one game in due to the same issue.\n(been in a normal draft queue together for 15 mins atm)","replies":[]}]}
