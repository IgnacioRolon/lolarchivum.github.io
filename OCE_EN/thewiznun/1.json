That way you don&#039;t feel bad that you always only play with one skin and you haven&#039;t wasted money on the other skins that you have brought (Or been gifted).\r\n\r\nWhat are your thoughts?","replies":[{"poster":"iPatch","date":"2016-09-26T09:51:09.248+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"This is a great idea! {{sticker:slayer-pantheon-thumbs}}","replies":[]},{"poster":"Nijel","date":"2016-09-26T07:16:02.645+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":".#Iknowthatfeel #firstworldproblems ; )\n\nI'm not sure about all the new things coming with the Client Update but this sounds like it would be an excellent addition. \n\nMaybe it could be displayed as the last skin in the skin selection menu as a big question mark. Not only would that be a decent way to present it but it would let you choose the specific champs you would like the system to randomise for you (rather than a global toggle applying to all champs).","replies":[]},{"poster":"Wess","date":"2016-09-26T06:02:01.494+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I like it!","replies":[]},{"poster":"Bambooze","date":"2016-09-26T04:47:51.388+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I guess it would be good, but only if it's a toggle function","replies":[]}]}
