So bored that they would rather go make out with there girlfriend or go get a frozen coke because why would anyone sit in front of a computer for 5-20 minutes then if they miss the accept match option they have to wait another 5-20 minutes. Come on, really.\r\n\r\n2# This game when it was released in beta was the best game ever to hit the market, stop going backwards please you&#039;ll just be another WoW, awesome then nothing. Losing customers is not making money which is not helping you develop this game.\r\n\r\n3# People have lives, if they leave a match once every 20 games that is not fking bad, This is moba, people will leave every now and again because games take 40 Fking minutes and if your boss calls you up suddenly to get to work do you really think people will stop and be like O, S**t better not get punished for leaving a game, Do you realize the job is how people pay for riot points that keep this game running? there is a difference between a pro leaving in a high level ranked match to a non ranked average match were your skill isn&#039;t on the line ( IT&#039;S FOR FUN )\r\n\r\nIf you really want to punish people at least have a percentage of games they have left compared to the total games played before you start destroying this game that people have come to love-punish people through a temporary suspension or something because how the hell is this working for you. (Some people on your team have poured there heart and soul into to try build this game). We play when we have time to and that 5-20 minutes you take away I think the worst part is if your waiting 20 minutes and you go make a coffee and miss the accept your 20 minute wait in invalid . .!..  ..!. .\r\n\r\nWhoever has been making all these changes over the past few years needs to get fired. Stop ruining a game people have been playing for 5 years just because you think you know all the answers new guy.\r\n\r\nLastly I&#039;m not saying that leaving matches is OK, I feel bad when I do it and I dislike it when it happens. Punishing your entire player base because some people leave matches all the time is not OK. I am not not okay with this. I&#039;m 23 and I don&#039;t have time to muck around when I&#039;m not at work I have a life and when I want to chill out on the game that I enjoy and have spent money on don&#039;t make me wait because &#039;I&#039; make time for this game.","replies":[{"poster":"JasonWazza","date":"2016-09-03T09:15:37.763+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":">If you really want to punish people at least have a percentage of games they have left compared to the total games played\n\nJust as a point, this is actually the case, I'm still yet to get any sort of ban with probably close to 2.5k norms under my belt, and i have recently been leaving the occasional game, and am yet to be banned.\n\nFact is afking on the odd occasion is fine, and riot know this, but if your afking every 20 games, like you say, there is an issue and this person should be playing a different game.\n\nFor example if i someone with 2.5k games afk'd every 20 games, i would have afk'd **125** times, and on top of that, would have basically ruined the game for **1,125 People**\n\nDo you think this is acceptable?\n\nBecause i don't.\n\nLeaving 5% of games, just isn't acceptable, regardless of reason.","replies":[{"poster":"KawtYouNow","date":"2016-09-12T11:20:42.766+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"GIVE THIS MAN A MEDAL...SOMEBODY","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Tele","date":"2016-09-03T00:56:39.693+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"The idea is that LeaverBuster wastes your time because you wasted the time of others. \n\nWhen someone leaves a game, 4 other people have to wait 20 minutes before they're allowed to leave. The competitiveness in the match is gone and it's not fun anymore. It's a massive waste of time for everyone.\n\nLets be fair though, this is partly **Riot**'s fault too. There needs to be more systems like _/remake_ to end games with AFKs quicker. \n\n***_\n\n> People have lives, if they leave a match once every 20 games that is not fking bad\n\n+ Everyone understands that you have responsibilities in real life, and LeaverBuster allows for you to leave some games [unpunished](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752714-LeaverBuster-FAQ#h3q3). But remember **you also have a responsibility to your team to finish the game.** \n\n You're playing with real people who also have lives. Their time also has value.\n\n Also consider, if everyone left 1/20 games then 50% of all games could be decided by an AFK. I don't know about you, but that's hardly competitive at all.\n\n> If you really want to punish people at least have a percentage of games they have left compared to the total games played...\n\n+ I believe this is actually already roughly how LeaverBuster works. If you AFK in more than X% of your games, you'll start to receive punishments.","replies":[{"poster":"Melbounce","date":"2016-09-03T04:54:45.462+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Riot are just lazy or have poor coding skills, using adobe air says it all.

This should let you deal with rare occurrences like your choking girlfriend or a power outage, without getting punished.\n\nIt's also important to remember that, for everyone else in the game, it makes no difference whether you left for a legitimate reason or not. The outcome is the same for them.\n\n_ What about when I got a power outage and left my first game and was punished straight away?_\n\n+ I know LeaverBuster punishes once your % of AFK games gets too high. If you've only played a few games, then it might trigger LeaverBuster very quickly. I've had it happen on a few smurf accounts. \n\n Did you have less than 100 games when this happened? I'd say that was probably the cause of the issue.\n\n Once you get more games in you should be given plenty of room for the occasional AFK.\n\n__*\n\nYour proof system idea is pretty good BTW. I think it would just be really hard to implement and a little inconvenient. \n\n+ When there's a power outage, would you have to go down to the power company for official \"logs\" to send to **Riot**? \n\n I'm also not sure how you can prove anecdotal stuff like the accident with your fiancÃ©e. **Riot** would really just have to take your word for it, which leaves the system open to being exploited.","replies":[{"poster":"WeaponizedAutizm","date":"2016-09-05T20:19:50.801+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Your modem/router will have a log and Widows Events will also have a log.

The whole point of these systems is to make sure the _time_ matches the _crime_ and as Tele said, leaving games wastes the time of 9 other people. It's only fair that you should have to waste some of yours. At the end of the day, no one says that you need to sit down at your computer and watch the timer count down. Finding something else to do these days really isn't that difficult, and when you've done your time you can move forwards a lil wiser so you never have to go through it again.","replies":[]}]}
