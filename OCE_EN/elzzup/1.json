So bored that they would rather go make out with there girlfriend or go get a frozen coke because why would anyone sit in front of a computer for 5-20 minutes then if they miss the accept match option they have to wait another 5-20 minutes. Come on, really.  \n\n2# This game when it was released in beta was the best game ever to hit the market, stop going backwards please you'll just be another WoW, awesome then nothing. Losing customers is not making money which is not helping you develop this game.\n\n3# People have lives, if they leave a match once every 20 games that is not f**king bad, This is moba, people will leave every now and again because games take 40 F**king minutes and if your boss calls you up suddenly to get to work do you really think people will stop and be like O, S**t better not get punished for leaving a game, Do you realize the job is how people pay for riot points that keep this game running? there is a difference between a pro leaving in a high level ranked match to a non ranked average match were your skill isn't on the line ( IT'S FOR FUN ) \n\nIf you really want to punish people at least have a percentage of games they have left compared to the total games played before you start destroying this game that people have come to love-punish people through a temporary suspension or something because how the hell is this working for you. (Some people on your team have poured there heart and soul into to try build this game). We play when we have time to and that 5-20 minutes you take away \n\nWhoever has been making all these changes over the past year needs to get fired. Stop ruining a game people have been playing for 5 years just because you think you know all the answers new guy.\n\nLastly I'm not saying that leaving matches is OK, I feel bad when I do it and I dislike it when it happens. Punishing your entire player base because some people leave matches all the time is not OK. I am not not okay with this. I'm 23 and I don't have time to muck around when I'm not at work I have a life and when I want to chill out on the game that I enjoy and have spent money on don't make me wait because 'I' make time for this game.\n\nGod that felt good to get off my chest. \n\n-------\n\nI also came up with an idea that I think might be cool, League Of Legends has an open world mode were you level up and choose customs skills ( I'm sure some of you played custom hero's WC3) maybe a limit to one passive and 3-4 skills that you earn or something. Just throwing the ball at that idea.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Knuuckles","date":"2015-02-13T09:18:30.511+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"i know what you mean, 20 minute LPQ got me thinking some crazy things","replies":[]}]}
