I get it I had/have connection issues in a ranked game twice in a row, for that I am  genuinely sorry. For everyone involved and because I was trying to win but in my defense i reconnected to both of those games and won one of them also your punishment isn&#039;t necessary potentially losing was punishment enough nobody has perfect internet, I realize that until my connection is sorted I shouldn&#039;t touch ranked. Seriously though this isn&#039;t a job - waiting 20 minutes to enjoy a video game is like driving to work and not getting paid. Fuck you, I started up last week after not playing for a year because of this leaver buster crap and its happened all over again. I know I&#039;m one person and that having connection issues effects other and for that I am sorry. But your punishment is like doing jail time. Its a fucking video game and I&#039;ve invested over 200 dollars into it so sort your shit out. As it stands you&#039;ve costed me another 10 minutes of my life to write this riot games. Stop wasting my fucking time and let me play league.","replies":[]}
