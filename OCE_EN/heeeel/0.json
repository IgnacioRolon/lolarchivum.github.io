I've also seen this in champ select, for example, if the captain doesn't ban a particular champion, they'll give up before the game has even begun, or just begin abusing the rest of the team for any mistake. No one wants that kind of a team mate. People play this game to have fun, not to get abused. \r\n\r\n**tl dr:\r\nNext time you're playing and you see something you don't agree with, or someone makes a mistake, don't cry, don't give up, that doesn't help anyone. **","replies":[{"poster":"Jakiron","date":"2015-01-25T19:54:59.290+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"omg whut a nub crying coz he's bad I'm afk gg enjoy your loss","replies":[{"poster":"Dawaraven","date":"2015-01-28T06:13:20.310+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Ribbon main?","replies":[]}]}]}
