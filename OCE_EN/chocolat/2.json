As I understand it was very script intensive, so coding for all the new bots will be a challenge.\n\nAs a side note though, [**Riot FeralPony**](http://ask.fm/RiotFeralPony/answers/137246540806) did say they were developing new modes for the rotating queue. This indicates **Riot** is keen to add new content to the rotating queue, so I'd say it's likely we'll get Doom Bots again sometime in the future.","replies":[{"poster":"Shashe","date":"2016-06-06T09:42:45.620+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Okay cool, sounds good.
