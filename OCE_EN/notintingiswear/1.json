Do you really? Level 20 accounts running Mark and Exhaust, never changing runes. Literally ever, so you get Malzahar with PTA, and Lux with Grasp. YOU DO NOT NEED MORE TIME! \r\n\r\nhttps://imgur.com/a/gr1YEjt\r\n\r\nDo not try and say &quot;We need more time.&quot; You do not. You need to improve your fucking detection. When a player can not change A SINGLE rune or summoner for 20 levels, that is blatant. I&#039;ll remind you. By level 6, JUST 6! You have unlocked Ghost, Heal, Barrier, Mark, Clarity. Name me 1 human who will get the INCREDIBLY OBVIOUS notification they unlocked a new summoner spell, and then proceed to never change it. Name me 1 human who will ignore the notifications about the ability to change runes when you unlock the ability to fully customise them by level 15. And if I recall you unlock the ability to pick any Primary rune you want at level 9 or something.\r\n\r\nThe behaviour these bots exhibit is blatant, to the point that you can tell who is a bot, with over 75% accuracy, on champ select. With ONLY the knowledge of Summs and their name. How you guys with internal stuff cannot detect them shows your incompetency. You do not need to ban them at level 2. But start adding flags, make it so when an account is suspicious, only put it on a team with other suspicious accounts. \r\n\r\nTo FURTHER add to the incompetency. I made a post exposing 77 bots. This post was 1 week after I started my little experiment. I reported nearly every single one, every game. After 1 week. Barely any were banned. So I made my post. 1 week later, still several unbanned. A week later, STILL several unbanned. I make a support ticket. A riot employee responds. A week later, STILL ONE UNBANNED. This means this bot, who did the same behaviour, not only remained unbanned for a MONTH, despite hundreds of reports, including CONTACTING RIOT DIRECTLY. But this account was able to exist for long enough to GET SOLD AND PLAY RANKED FOR 2 FUCKING WEEKS. \r\n\r\nStop being fucking incompetent riot. Because you are. I&#039;ve explained to you in detail a few ways you could implement to mitigate the issue. How many steps were taken? 0. Sites like G2A? They&#039;ve existed for years, selling league accounts, despite this being a direct violation of your ToS. \r\n\r\nAnd to the people who could look at a bought account, and didn&#039;t have the competency to scroll down past their smurfing games from AFTER THEY BOUGHT IT to before it started playing ranked. I pity you. Must be hard living with that few brain cells.\r\n\r\nRiot games. I want to believe you when you say you&#039;re taking steps to deal with the problem. I really really do. But I can&#039;t see it. No one can. As a result of bots remaining unbanned even after contacting support to report a 3 week old bot, I&#039;m done reporting them ingame. Why is it my responsibility to spend 2 minutes after a game that I just wasted 20 minutes in, reporting 6 players, just for them to remain unbanned anyway. Fix. Your. Shit.\r\n\r\n/rant","replies":[]}
