Warriors imbued with the light of the first star. Destined to protect others from the creatures from the darkness. Each one a blazing star, burning their own lives to harness the power within their souls. Each one living a beautiful but ever so fleeting life. Except me. my light was ever so dim. Whilst my team stood tall in their fight against the darkness, I could only stand behind them, relying on their lights to shield me. Cowering. Weak. \r\n     A raindrop jolts me out of my daydream. I glance at the city, the world my sisters once protected and slip back into my memories. For years I have waited for the First Star to bring my sisters back to me. Instead, over the years the First Star has been calling other teams of guardians to Earth. It has realised that one team isn&rsquo;t enough to protect this planet. But even knowing that I am not the only guardian on this planet doesn&rsquo;t curb my loneliness. My guilt. The fault of a fallen team lies with its leader. My sisters. My twin sister, Diana, among them. As we grew up I was always her aspiration, her strength. Yet when she needed me most, I could only run and hide whilst they fought. My light being so weak that the creatures could not sense me, my existence as a leader binding me to value my own life more than those of my sisters.\r\n     When the fighting ended the sun shone upon the remains of the battlefield. Star guardians pass away in one of two forms. The first is where their entire essence fades away and leaves behind their shattered core. The second is where their core is taken away by their familiars and their bodies are left behind. My team was of the second type. \r\n    Dreadful howls erupt around me, pulling me out of my mind demanding my attention. Once again the corruption of darkness seeks to claim my city, my home. Countless creatures of varying sizes begin pouring into the clifftop clearing I rest on. The new teams are young. Clueless. They do not understand the depth of the power they hold, they are not ready to face such a threat. \r\n       Each Star Guardian has a Guiding star, a star which mirrors their power and their personality. When a Guardian realises which star is theirs, they will achieve a new level of strength, unparalleled by what they have now. But they must face it alone. I cannot teach them, cannot hint at what they can become. Each day I walk past them in the hallway I pry at their lights, hoping they have become closer to their true selves while I myself wear a mask. One of a teacher who would not teach what they truly needed to know.\r\n       I look over the disintegrating husks of shadow and proceed towards their source. Before I take the first step a familiar tang pulls at my heart. My heart skips a beat, skips two. Relishes in the feeling. My sisters are on their way back. I increase my pace, leaping past the dusty remnants. Bashing aside those in my way, slashing those that were too large. As I finally reach the lakeside clearing I see 4 streams of light proceeding towards me. My heart leaps with joy, I may be their elder now but I am still their leader, our bonds still stand. I ignite my shield and raise it, welcoming their return. The creatures surrounding me suddenly shrink away, fearful of my light, confused at how strong I have become. I snicker, the sun too, is a star.\r\n\r\n&ldquo;My name is Leona!&rdquo; I roar as I turn to face the recoiling horde. \r\n\r\n&ldquo;And for today it&rsquo;s a class on Supernovas!&rdquo;","replies":[{"poster":"Akkordian Zoeve","date":"2017-09-18T05:39:14.532+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I loved the twist on how the guardian wasn't actually a student, but a teacher :D","replies":[]}]}
