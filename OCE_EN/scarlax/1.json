Opinions on him were varied, some adored his talent for cards and fancy dress, whilst others called him a treacherous swindler. But what everyone agreed on was that he never played fair. No matter how charming or clean he seemed, there was always an ace or two up his sleeve. However today the man, now known as Twisted Fate, had no plans of conning any being of their gold. He had only come to unwind, enjoy his newfound freedom after narrowly escaping from Bilgewater&#039;s clutches. Now playing in a casual poker competition he&#039;d now reached the finals from sheer luck alone. \n{{champion:254}} \n&quot;You aren&#039;t pulling any tricks today?&quot; Across his table sat VI, the Piltovan Enforcer. Even though she had forgone her usual gauntlets and metallic suit for leather ones her eyes seemed to carry even more ferocity than they did on the rift. Word was that she had been keeping an eye on T.F. since he had arrived in Piltover.\n{{champion:104}} \n&quot;We&#039;ve got too much time for tricks.&quot; A gruff voice interjected. Malcom Graves, T.F&#039;s old partner in crime and life. \n&quot;And you ain&#039;t worth any of it chickie, ain&#039;t I right Tobias?&quot;\n\n&quot;Simmer down hotshot, today&#039;s a good day and you&#039;ll scare lady luck away with those manners of yours.&quot; TF said while hushing graves with quick glance.\n&quot;You&#039;ll see what I mean.&quot;\n\n~~~~\n{{champion:51}} {{champion:254}} \nThey were suddenly interrupted by the sound of sirens going off when shortly Caitlyn burst in through the roof on a hidden platform with a cache of some sort.\n\n&quot;IT&#039;S THE CLOCKWORK VAULT! SOMEONE&#039;S TRYING TO BREAK INTO IT, WE NEED TO GET GOING NOW VI.&quot; she barked hastily.\n&quot;Simmer down cupcake,&quot; Chimed VI gleefully while she hopped onto the platform. &quot;You know I&#039;m always ready for a punch up sweetie.&quot; \n&quot;We&#039;ll finish this later _Tobias_,&quot; mocks Vi before zipping up with Caitlyn.\n{{champion:4}} {{champion:104}} \nTF and Graves shoot a knowing glance to each other. Years ago they were the only people who have ever broken into the Clockwork Vault. Having someone else try now meant either kindred souls had appeared, or someone was trying to mock their great deed.\n\n&quot;You go first partner, I&#039;ll catch up.&quot; T.F said before disappearing in a shower of cards from his sleeve.\n\n&quot;How ironic.&quot; Graves rolled his eyes and set towards the door but not before he flipped T.F&#039;s hand over. A royal flush, the highest hand possible.\n&quot;Well I&#039;ll be damned. _Lady Luck IS smiling_.&quot; He mimed while crashing through the door towards the vault.\n\n~~~~\n{{champion:4}} \nT.F landed in front of the treasury and surveyed his surroundings. There were meant to be cameras, security bots, sentries and all manners of security systems installed in each nook and cranny of the facility, making it the safest Vault in history. T.F had only bypassed everything back then with his teleportation magic and so far to his knowledge, apart from him, no one (minus the summoners) could utilise such unique magic.\n \nHe tentatively walked towards the direction of the Clockwork Vault. If they didn&#039;t teleport in, yet bypassed the cameras without disabling them there was only one other possibility he could think of. _They weren&#039;t detected by anything until they tried opening the vault._ The thought left a bitter taste in T.F&#039;s mouth, among the few individuals he knew of, there were only two that could maintain extended periods of invisibility. The question now tugging on his mind was _Why are they doing this?_\n{{champion:28}} \nAs if to answer his question a face materialised inches away from his own. A blue skinned beauty with the mark of a full moon upon her forehead. Clad in dark leather and bright orange goggles she looked even better than he remembered. \n\n&quot;E-Evelynn,&quot; T.F stumbled along the name. Her appearance brought along a slew of conflicting emotions to T.F. The one and only woman to have broken his heart instead of  her own, if she had one. He held his ground while he began to flip a card behind his back.&quot; _Blue, Red, Gold, Blue, Red, Gold._&quot; he chanted to himself, trying to calm himself down\n\n&quot;Oh sweetie look at you, you look like you&#039;ve...seen a ghost.&quot; Evelynn slowly approached him and caressed his face with her hand. \n&quot;_Did you...miss me_?&quot; her hands had wrapped around his neck like a snake evaluating its prey. \n\n&quot;_GOLD! JUST DO IT! JUST TAKE HER OUT!_&quot; T.F screamed in his mind. Steeling his will he reached behind her, feinting to hold her whilst grasping his card till his knuckles glowed the same colour as his card.\n\n&quot;_Tobias I&#039;ve missed you so much_.&quot; she whispered into his ear before pulling back and wrapping her lips around his. T.F&#039;s card dissipated along with his will. Giving in to Evelynn&#039;s embrace he pulled her close, to cherish the fleeting moment as much as he could. \n\nMoments pass and they stood face to face. T.F&#039;s mind was trying to find the right words but all he could choke out was &quot;Why are you here?&quot;\n\n&quot;Your eyes are still so beautiful Tobias, I thought I&#039;d never see the-.&quot;\n\n&quot;WHY ARE YOU HERE?&quot; Shouted T.F, his mind clearer.\n\nWithout warning Evelynn threw a sidewards kick with enough force to carry T.F all the way to the wall. Evelynn approached the fallen man and smirked sadistically. \n&quot;Why I&#039;m obviously here to break into the Clockwork Vault dear  and we&#039;re going to take everything from it. E-V-E-R-Y-T-H-I-N-G.&quot; Evelynn savoured every last letter of the word as if it was a world renowned delicacy.\n\nT.F&#039;s eyes widened in horror, back when he and Graves had intruded they had only taken certain exploited goods from corrupt nobles. But if the Clockwork Vault was cleared out there would be irreparable damage caused to the Piltovan economy...or worse.\n\n&quot;_Twitch, its twitch with her._&quot; This meant that the gold would all go to Zaun, empowering the already powerful mad scientists rampant in the lawless city state. Which could escalated to another war, one which the summoners could not prevent or end.\n \n&quot;Why...?&quot; T.F looked despairingly at Evelynn, hoping that this was just another one of her jokes. \n&quot;You used to be so kind.&quot;\n\n&quot;Kind?&quot; Chimed Evelynn before unleashing an abysmal laugh.\n\n&quot;EVERYTHING. WAS. TO. MAKE. YOU. SUFFER.&quot; Evelynn accentuated each word with another heavy blow to the River Rogue before he finally crumples, and his world goes dark.\n\n~~~~\n{{champion:51}} {{champion:4}} {{champion:104}} \nSplish-Splish-Splish\nBANG!\nT.F awoke with a jolt to see a slightly concerned Caitlyn.\n\n&quot;Don&#039;t die yet partner, that was only a warning shot.&quot; smirked Graves as he knelt down next to T.F.\n&quot;Figured you&#039;d probably run into some trouble so I brought some potions along for you, so much for a good day huh?&quot;\n\n&quot;Now if you&#039;re actually up, its emergency time so can we get going already?&quot; asked Caitlyn impatiently before setting off towards the vault.\n\nT.F grinned, he&#039;d never have imagined himself to be relieved to hear that posh voice. Nor did he think that the stiff sheriff was capable of making a joke. Picking himself up and nodding towards Graves&#039; direction together they set off towards the vault. \n\n~~~~\n{{champion:4}}  {{champion:254}}  {{champion:51}} {{champion:104}}  || {{champion:28}} {{champion:29}} \nAs they reached the vault they caught sight of Vi engaged in battle with Evelynn and Twitch desperately trying to crack the vault, Vi threw punches that dented the vaults with each blow but Evelynn was nimble and avoided each blow by mere inches. \n\n&quot;So that&#039;s how you were done in,&quot; says Graves cheerfully.\n&quot;I sure wish I was there to see it.&quot;\n\n&quot;Tough luck, Malcom.&quot; scowled T.F. \n\nT.F throws an empowered card right at Twitch while Graves cocks his shotgun and lets loose a specialised returning shell towards the ongoing duel. Vi and Evelynn both narrowly avoid being caught in the blast whereas Twitch was hit in the hand by the card and retreated to the shadows, cursing. Evelynn turned to see the scope aimed at her and scowled before calling upon a large field of spikes which hit Vi as she charged in but stopping the rest in their tracks. Traces of the injuries inflicted on Vi flowed back to Evelynn and forms a shield to block the pursuing sniper shot by Caitlyn.\n\n&quot;VI STOP THE VAULTS SAFE NOW,&quot; screamed Caitlyn but her order fell on deaf ears as Vi was still hot on Eve&#039;s tracks, determined to chase her down.\n\nAs they burst out of the Treasury and into the Town Square Twitch materialises next to Evelynn and throws a foul flask containing a deadly concoction at Vi only to have it sliced in twine and blown back by a throwing card and empowered explosive shell. \n\n&quot;I didn&#039;t want THAT one back,&quot; grumbled Twitch as he once again slipped into the shadows. \n{{champion:222}} \nOut of nowhere a variety of animals stampede into the square, each graffitied in bright neon pink. One elephant in particular has a short, pale rider.\n&quot;FATHANDS! HOW CAN YOU BE PLAYING TAG WITHOUT ME?!&quot; shouts the rider.\n\n&quot;JINX!&quot; roars Vi as she gets cut off by the ensuing stampede.\n\n&quot;Awwww Sorry Fathands, but today I&#039;m on their side, I get to annoy you more this way HAHAAHAHAHAH!&quot; Jinx dances with glee on her ride before jumping off and disappearing in the chaos. _&quot;We can play better games if there&#039;s more people right Fathands?&quot;_ is signed on her elephant.\n\n~~~~\n{{champion:4}} {{champion:104}} \n&quot;So much for a relaxing average day huh Tobias?&quot; complains Graves before emptying his mug. \n&quot;The animals took forever to herd up, and the chickies even had the gall to get us to help!&quot;\n\n&quot;Better herding animals than breaking you outta jail hotshot,&quot; T.F shoots back. \n\nT.F slowly flips a card while staring at his drink. Yes, love, hate, magic and fisticuffs all seem like something that would happen in an average day in Runeterra, even as a child that much was apparent.\n\nSuddenly a summoning circle appears underneath the duo&#039;s feet. _Oh right and this. How&#039;d he forget about this. _","replies":[]}
