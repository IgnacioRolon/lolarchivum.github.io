ADC be loving you. \nMax W next, slow helps, but the bonus move is a bonus I guess.\nThen last max Q. All you need to do is boop enemies with Q, get behind them and ulti them into your turret. \nAnd when it comes to late game, try to split them apart, usually by pushing tanks away, and squishies into your team (you'll wanna flash for that). \n\nBuild wise, rush ardent into athene's, finish sup item, move speed boots (the yellow ones). Twin shadows would be a must because iirc, her W scales from movespeed now. Redeption either before or after boots (wont matter, move speed bonus already). \n\nGo Summon Aery, Manaflow band, trancendence, scortch, and any combo of font of life, revitalize and bone platting. \n\nFound this has worked for me like 90% of the time.","replies":[]}]}
