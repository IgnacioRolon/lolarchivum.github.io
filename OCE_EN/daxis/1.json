I would right click on a minion expecting malph to gently stroll up and pummel it but instead i would get him walking back and forward behind an unpassable wall of minions. This was not just a one off but it happend multiple times. Some times even with 2 minions alone. it was like watching an alzheimers patient make breakfast.\r\n\r\nMaybe its just me but i think it needs a bit of attention. Do you agree?

Im up for some good yarns.","replies":[{"poster":"DragonOfTheVoid","date":"2015-11-24T11:01:55.807+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"its not just 1 champ its all ap and tank champs now and not just tanks","replies":[]}]}
