Usually it's not noticeable because the explanation has a fancy cinematic camera pan to keep you distracted. If that camera pan is not happening, then it could be a glitched client. Firstly, make sure your locale is correctly selected, and that your computer also has this locale selected. Then, try repairing the client from the patcher (it's in the cog, I believe. If not, try the question mark. Both are at the top right).\n\n>I also tried to play a game, but the server kept on crashing and freezing,\n\nThe server has been playing up of recent, but it wasn't so bad that it was constantly kicking out players, just a bit of lag.

I just took the terminology for granted.\n\n\"Locale\" means what language/location your computer is supposedly in. For example, if your locale is Australia, Sydney, then your time would automatically be adjusted to [UTC+ 10](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UTC%C2%B100:00) and your language would be set to \"English AU\". There is a setting for this on your computer, usually labeled \"Region\" or \"Locale\". I'm sorry that I can't be specific, but it's different for each OS.\n\nWhich leads onto OS, which means operating system. In essence, what software runs on your computer to run other software. Examples are Windows 7, Mac Yosemite, Ubuntu, Windows 8, etc.\n\nYour ISP is your internet service provider. When you connected to the internet, you needed to pay a company for that connection. That company is your ISP. Examples are Telstra, Internode, Optus, Vodafone, etc.\n\nPatcher is a term specifically for League of Legends. It's the first window that opens up when you double-click the League of Legends icon. What the patcher does is download the latest updates for the game for you, and then \"patches\" them onto your existing game. It's useful for if something goes wrong with installation, as it should just fix it automatically. You can manually evoke this action by clicking \"Repair\".\n\nIf you're on Windows, please do the following:\n1. Press Winkey+R. Type in \"dxdiag\" without quotations. Hit Enter.\n2. Click on the \"Display\" tab at the top of the window that opens up.\n3. Upload the information relayed on that tab. You can do this by either using the Snipping Tool to create an uploadable screenshot which you can attach to your reply, or you can just type up everything that appears. I mainly need to know what's under \"Name:\", \"Main Driver:\", \"Current Display Mode:\" and if there are any \"Notes\".\n\nIf you need any help with that, tell me your OS and I'll be able to get you more exact instructions.","replies":[{"poster":"Lizard22","date":"2015-05-10T02:24:09.934+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Ok...\nI'm in Adelaide, and the computer has Windows (That's all i know i'm afraid)\nI have no idea who my ISP is.\nI don't know which key is the Winkey, and I don't know how to use a snipping tool.\n\nsorry I can't be more help.","replies":[{"poster":"HORSE OF FORCE","date":"2015-05-10T04:01:27.420+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Ok, Winkey refers to the key on your keyboard that has the Windows logo on it. It may also be known as the meta key, the super key, or the physical start button. The version of Windows you have should be written on the box your computer came in, if you brought the computer that could work straight out of the box (you didn't install the OS yourself, which explains why you wouldn't know what it is; a computer cannot function without an OS).\n\nIf you don't know who your ISP is, ask the person whom provides you with an internet connection (like your administrator or guardians). If you don't know who that is, well, that's just bad practice. You shouldn't be using something which you don't know the limitations of or origin of it. It's like drinking the water that falls out of the sky and not knowing what rain is.\n\nThe snipping tool is available in all recent versions of Windows. It can be accessed by searching for it from the start menu. To do that, open the start menu, click the text box, and type in \"Snipping Tool\". It should be the first result. The icon looks like a pair of scissors with two circles behind it. Make sure the mode it's on is \"rectangle\", and once you do that, it should turn your screen grey-ish. Draw a rectangle over the area you want by dragging from one corner to the opposite.\n\nTo check your locale (and OS too, if you still haven't found that yet), there's two things. First, go into your control panel (accessible from searching for it from the start menu). Click \"System and Security\", and then \"System\" (the big green text) to see what OS is currently running. This is different if you're on Windows XP, which I highly doubt. To check your locale, press back twice to get back to the control panel's homescreen. Then click \"Clock, Language, and Region\". Here, you can check \"Change location\" to see if the correct region (Australia) is selected, and \"Date and Time\" to make sure your clock is set up correctly. You should be using \"(UTC+ 9:30) Adelaide\" for your \"Time Zone\". Then, go to the \"Internet Time\" tab and sync your clock to any of the servers listed. If it's already set to automatically sync, then you can just leave it.\n\ntl dr; Go to Windows Help and search these things. They can explain it with pictures.\n\nDid you get dxdiag to show you what display settings are currently enabled?","replies":[{"poster":"Lizard22","date":"2015-05-10T04:19:17.698+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"here's what i've been able to find out so far:\nos is windows 8\nname: Radeon R7 240\ndriver aticfx64.dll\ndisplay 1680x1050 (32bit)(60Hz)\nno notes\n\nlocale seems to be right\n\nI think ISP is adam","replies":[{"poster":"HORSE OF FORCE","date":"2015-05-10T04:45:29.024+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I have not heard of that ISP before.

If you set up a custom game, and find that you can't issue any commands, then there's no way you can actually die. Your champion would be on the fountain and constantly regening their health, not to mention the bots don't aggro that far. Could you be clear in what exactly you can and can't do?

It drastically reduces the chances of it being a local issue on your computer. That sounds like there's a problem with your connection.\n\n[This page](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664) has a bunch of things suggested by Riot to try and help with these sorts of situations. I'll provide a brief synopsis of the most influential ones:\n\n* Switch connection, for example connecting with a wire instead of wirelessly.\n* Turn off your firewall/anti-virus before playing.\n* Completely uninstall your firewall/anti-virus (but be sure to reinstall once you're done!)\n* Use an alternate DNS (this one is a bit complicated, instructions below).\n* Forward League's ports (even more complicated, if you want to try then tell me your modem's manufacturer).\n* Turn off any VPN or proxies (if you don't know what these are, then you don't have to worry).\n\nTo change your DNS in Windows 8:\n1. Press Winkey (start) and type in \"Control Panel\". Click \"Control Panel\".\n2. Click \"Network and Internet\".\n3. Click \"Network and Sharing Center\".\n4. Click \"Change adapter settings\" on the left hand side of the window.\n5. Identify which connection is the currently active one. Should be the one that doesn't have the cross on it. Right click that and go into \"Properties\".\n6. In the window that appears, there will be a list in the centre of it. Scroll down that list to somewhere near the bottom and select (do not untick) \"Internet Protocol Version 4 (TCP/IPv4)\"\n7. Click \"Use the following DNS server  addresses:\" and then type in 8.8.8.8 and 8.8.4.4 into the preferred and alternate fields respectively.\n8. Click \"OK\", \"OK\" and close the rest of the windows.\n9. Press Winkey (start) again and type in \"Command Prompt\". Right click \"Command Prompt\" and then click \"Run as Administrator...\"\n10. Type in (copy and paste does not work here) \"ipconfig /flushdns\" and then press Enter.\n11. When it's done, restart your computer.\n\nIf that's still failing, check the quality of your connection through this site:\nhttp://netalyzr.icsi.berkeley.edu/\nIt's an institute which has created this tool to assist people in diagnosing their internet connection. It requires Java to be installed and running on your system, as well as your browser having permission to use it. Usually, this means just clicking \"Allow\" to the prompt that comes up. If it doesn't, however, then that probably means you don't have Java installed. If that's the case, ask me. It's not the most straight-forward procedure.\n\nHopefully this will at least make what's going on a bit more clearer. Sorry for the wall of text, but making it shorter just won't work.","replies":[{"poster":"HORSE OF FORCE","date":"2015-05-15T07:08:22.998+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":">and have wasted your time.\n\nIf something's not working, then it's never a waste of time trying to fix it.\n\nFor wireless v. wired connections, you must first establish what connection you already have. If you have a laptop, almost 100% of the time it's wireless due to the portable nature of it. Some older laptops will still have support for a wired connection but actively encourage you **not** to use it. The fastest way to check is by asking the person who set up the computer. If they say the computer uses \"Wi-Fi\" then it's wireless. If it's anything else, then it's probably wired. If it's wireless, try plugging in a network cable into the computer and connecting to the internet that way.\n\nAlmost all firewalls and anti-viruses function in a different way, so it's pretty much impossible to set up generic instructions on how to do it for each program. Your best bet would be to go to the help documentation that comes with your program. Older ones will provide this documentation with the disc cover, but the newer ones opt to have all their documentation online (usually found in the \"Help\" submenu).\n\nTo uninstall a firewall/anti-virus, however, you can use Window's Control Panel. Go into the Control Panel and then click \"Uninstall programs\". Find your firewall/anti-virus and click \"Uninstall\", then follow the on-screen instructions. Some might ask you if you want to retain your settings, in which case you do because you'll be reinstalling later on.\n\nI can't really explain how to change your DNS in a more transparent manner. And port-forward is still pretty complicated. It's very much related to how much you know about your router.\n\nMost internet cafes will sport a copy of League on their system. It might be really costly to use, however. That in combination of risking your password being stolen and not being able to save your configurations, I would not suggest it.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Lizard22","date":"2015-05-14T04:46:23.635+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"a possible connection problem? damn.\n\nThose look very confusing (For me), and I'm not really sure what it all means (Apart from firewalls/anti virus).\nI am a bit worried though.
