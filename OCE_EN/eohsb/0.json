I am currently stuck in plat 3. Does my account&rsquo;s lp decay start after a week since i stopped playing rank game? Or is it 28 days? And how much of my lp does it cut mine down?\r\n\r\nAsking this question because I am living in Australia atm but think I&rsquo;ll visit ma homeland which is Korea for 2~3 weeks to get something solved.\r\nAnd I am a bit worried cuz as you all know, accounts can&rsquo;t be transfered to Korean server.\r\n\r\nPlz help my dead brain smart summoners :3","replies":[{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2018-04-18T04:22:08.850+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"28 days in Plat and Diamond, less in Master and Challenger. On that 28 days you'll lose 35 LP and again every 7 days after that. If you fall to or below 0 as a result of decay you'll be demoted a division.\n\nSo basically, play a game the day before you leave and you'll be fine :)\n\nhttps://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/204010760-Ranked-Play-FAQ#h3q1","replies":[{"poster":"EOHSB","date":"2018-04-18T16:57:26.108+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thank you thank you <3","replies":[]}]}]}
