So to explain what happens I will run up the start up process of exactly what I do and hopefully you guys can distinguish what I need to do. First up I open up the league client from my homepage on my laptop, Next I type in my username then my password then proceed to click sign in... so as you could imagine very average nothing out of the ordinary in that sign in process, yet it has popped up an alert that something went wrong with authenticating my account of some sort, it provides links but NONE of them go to anywhere. It&#039;s troubling me cause I&#039;ve spent quite a bit in money and time on this game and I would like to be able to play it. Some times it says I may be offline and I tried multiple strategies to get pass it but even IF I DO IT JUST GIVES ME THE AUTHENTICATION PROBLEM! I&#039;ve reinstalled the client and waited 4 hours for the bloody thing and it let me play 1 game, I&#039;m grateful for that but seriously.","replies":[{"poster":"Wuks","date":"2017-10-24T12:02:07.434+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Can you provide a screenshot of the error you're encountering?
