I can tell you're very skilled with Ahri. Good job :D Definitely subbing for more :)\n\nOne thing you could work on is when editing the audio to the clips, try to sync the music with the video (i.e. a down-beat on a kill, or a crescendo just before an epic engage).\n\nAlso, could you tell me how you made your intro? I would love to use something similar in my videos :)","replies":[{"poster":"Mixi","date":"2017-05-05T12:06:02.966+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"aww thank you, it means so much <33 i'll take your feedback thank you! \nI used http://velosofy.com/ to get a video template and edited it using After FX!\nYou can also just type on youtube 'youtube intro template', theres heaps of videos with different ones you could download and if you can edit them if you like with After FX!
