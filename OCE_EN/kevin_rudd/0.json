I will be sitting in the client, and my pvp.net will keep disconnecting for no reason at all. When it finally looks like it will be fine I go into a game,  and well during champ select. I will keep d/cing and reconnecting during it. The final straw for me was just before I was in champ select, got disconnected and had &quot;pvp.net exe has stopped working&quot; come up, it forced shut my client, I checked my profile and sure enough I&#039;d had been penalised the 3 lp (sure that isn&#039;t much) plus also having to wait 5:30 min before re queuing again, for something that isn&#039;t my fault.... This is just ridiculous. How can I can fix it? I even try reopening the client. Nothing works.\r\n\r\nIn fact as I type this type this, it has done it another 6 times and counting.","replies":[{"poster":"HORSE OF FORCE","date":"2015-06-17T02:52:33.550+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"What ISP are you with, and what OS are you on?\n\nDo you have any other applications running while League is open?","replies":[{"poster":"Kevin Rudd","date":"2015-06-17T06:27:45.590+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'm with Internode (iiNet), and run windows 7 home premium.

You've probably already tried that, lol. If you have any anti-virus/firewalls, try uninstalling them and running League.
