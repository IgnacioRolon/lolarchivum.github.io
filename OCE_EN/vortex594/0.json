(available from level 1)\r\nAlendi switches between Assault mode and Skirmish mode. \r\n\r\nR: inspiring charge.\r\nAlendi charges toward an enemy, applying fear, and gaining additional damage. while Inspiring charge is active, Alendi is immune to slows, including the slow from Weather the storm, and nearby allies are 50% resistant to slows.","replies":[{"poster":"Chicken4dinner","date":"2015-01-19T11:47:22.806+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I like the idea of assault/skirmish...\n\nBut two dashes without an early access disable, workable harass \nor any play style changes from assault to skirmish is a bit of a tip in his kit\n\nBTW, 2 things. you have bonus armour in his passive so why make his q scale to that? skirmishers will be built for attack damage and on hit effects mostly and as a first thought. Also his e should have bonuses themselves so assault and skirmish isn't just an ability change for q and passive.\n\nMake him different, Make him versatile but most of all make him fun!\n\nP.S also, I think his q footwork should have a multi use function that agrees with his kit. the dash back could be essential for the skirmishing side of him\nand tenacity mostly focuses on slows because that makes up for about 60% of all disables.","replies":[{"poster":"vortex594","date":"2015-01-27T01:53:22.759+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"i decided to give his Q armour scaling entirely due to the bonus armour from his passive, as if adding his weight to the ram.\nboth of his Qs are AA resets, with the idea of chasing an enemy in Assault mode, and evading attacks in Skirmish mode. the bonus damage from the armour is added to the damage of the auto attack. it's essentially a 100% ad scaling knockback, with some bonus damage from his armour.\n\nfor the E, perhaps a bonus to attack speed, or the speed of his footwork/ram. as the level increases, he dashes back/forward faster, or further. \n\nmy thoughts on footwork were that it would be used with his Assault/Skirmish.\nhis shoulder ram would be used to initiate, then he would switch to Skirmish as the enemy fights back, using footwork's dodge to avoid the enemy's attacks, switching back to Assault while footwork is on cooldown, for the bonus armour and occasional knockback from shoulder ram.\nif the enemy starts to run, footwork's bonus movespeed from Versatility helps him chase, or if he gets in trouble, run away. \n\ntenacity affects the duration of CC, not the strength of the effect. that's why i made his E give tenacity, rather than slow resistance, and inspiring charge gives immunity to slows, rather than CC. to avoid CC, he still needs to catch it with his E, even while inspiring charge is active.","replies":[{"poster":"Chicken4dinner","date":"2015-01-27T09:28:35.966+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I didn't know It was basic attack damage with his q. However I know for tenacity it is the length, what I meant is for weather the storm is that it is just too risky when no way to cancel the slow (excepting ult with a big cooldown that shouldn't be used with in mind to counter this slow) whereas slows make up most of the cc in the game. Say you have that slow debuff, and then someone slows you further (like nunu's e), you would be screwed for the amount of time it lasts (even with strong tenacity).\n\nSkirmish should also result in a short blind when he jumps back from a melee attack as he kicks dust in their eyes or something, jump back ram foreword and then some kind of duelling bonus.\n\nAlso I believe his abilities should differ between assault and skirmish, including ult\n\nP.S, Under a stroke of inspiration I realized you should have attack stacks for each stance, like with skirmish every third attack say he aims a sneaky cut under your opponents guard slowing their attack speed and interrupting their next attack animation, but he is really fragile in that stance. While Assault every 4 attacks or something he does a punch or hilt smash that breaks defence yet if they run he cant do much to keep up, or If he is ganked... well better switch stances. \n\nYou could consider making skirmish stance like \"thief in a swordfight stance\" (ask yourself, how could a thief possibly win in a swordfight? you know like dirty plays) whereas assault stance could be like \"let me crush through their vanguard\" and the bonuses of each stance can dwindle over time forcing a swap.","replies":[{"poster":"vortex594","date":"2015-01-27T23:37:24.177+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"i'll start from the bottom of your post. this will be a long one.\n\ni like the idea of the attack stacks, but i think it'd be more unique if they affected him, rather than the enemy.\nhow about these\n\nskirmish: every 3rd attack, Alendi gains 30% dodge chance, stacking until he dodges an attack.\nassault: every 3rd attack, Alendi raises his critical chance by 30%, stacking until he critically hits.\n\n\ni really don't like the idea of the \"thief in a swordfight\", Alendi is \"the soldier's pride\", after all. honour, but not to the point of getting himself killed. a skirmish isn't a dirty fight, it's a quick battle between a relatively small number. each side tries to strike quickly, and damage the other side's forces, while taking as little loss as possible. your impression of assault, on the other hand, is right on the mark. \ni also like the idea of the bonuses diminishing. perhaps the bonus stats decrease by 25-50% each time the skirmish/assault attack bonuses are applied?\n\nall his abilities changing with skirmish/assault is probably a good idea, though i think weather the storm should be in both.\nperhaps, when weather the storm blocks a spell, it gains a bonus effect based on skirmish/assault? \n\nskirmish: Alendi's cooldowns(except inspiring charge) are reduced by half. \nif he's used footwork recently, he can use it again right after weather the storm blocks something, and weather the storm itself will have half it's cooldown if it's used at the right time. this is also a punishment if you time it badly.\n\nassault: double the distance of Alendi's next shoulder ram, and it gains a very short stun(.25 seconds, or something around that).\n\n\nfor his ultimate, perhaps inspiring charge on assault mode, and a more duelist style ultimate in skirmish, say...\n\nValiant Engagement: Alendi gains bonus damage, attack speed, and gains bonus movement speed when moving towards an enemy. \n\nwith the differing ultimates for his stances, there needs to be a way to stop him from activating one, then switching to the other stance.\nperhaps, the bonuses from his passive don't diminish as he fights, and he can't switch stances while his ultimate is active.\n\n\n\non your next notes, Skirmish's footwork already does almost exactly that, but in a more soldier like way. he dashes back, avoiding the next AA. that means it misses. when he dashes back in, his next attack shreds armour.\n\n\nperhaps, rather than being slowed AFTER he blocks a spell, he's slowed BEFORE he blocks it. with good timing, this means he can avoid the slow altogether, but it's still there if he times it badly. \n\n\nany other ideas? i think i'll edit this stuff into the main post soon, along with character design, and lore once i come up with it.","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"DiabolicEsper","date":"2015-01-27T03:02:51.645+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"the w and the e makes his guy too hard to kill.\nWill get nerfed hard...","replies":[]},{"poster":"Faruel","date":"2015-01-17T06:26:53.393+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"i like this idea, a lore and some base stats/ progression would be good.","replies":[]},{"poster":"PREETY R","date":"2015-01-16T02:43:09.528+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Would be ridiculously op","replies":[]}]}
