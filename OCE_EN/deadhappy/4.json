Beyond that aim, it&#039;s a great place to meet like-minded players to play with.\n\nIt also provides dedicated team channels for you and your new team to voice chat.\n\nFeel free to join: https://discord.gg/jHUjmRR\n\n\nOver 150 players have joined so far and the player-base is growing fast, teams are forming and players are looking. Great place to find some scrims before Clash launches!","replies":[]}
