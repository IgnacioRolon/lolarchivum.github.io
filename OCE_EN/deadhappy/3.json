Beyond that aim, it's a great place to meet like-minded players.\n\nIt also provides dedicated team channels for you and your new team to voice chat.\n\nFeel free to join: https://discord.gg/jHUjmRR\n\nThe more the merrier.\n\nUpdate: 70 players have joined so far and the server is growing steadily, teams are forming and players are looking. Clash launches on the 25th!","replies":[]}
