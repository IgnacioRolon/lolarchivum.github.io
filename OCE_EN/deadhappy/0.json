It also has players looking for teams so if you&#039;re looking to fill some roles this is a good place to do it.\r\n\r\nThe server holds weekly scrim nights on Monday and Tuesday 7PM-10PM AEST. You&#039;re welcome to participate in just 1 night or if the timeslots don&#039;t suit you at all, you&#039;re not required to participate and can scrim teams from the server whenever you like.\r\n\r\n**Server Size**\r\nPlayers: 186\r\nRegistered Teams: 6\r\n\r\n1st scrim night kicks on Monday 4th of June 7PM AEST. Great opportunity to get some high-pressure games in before Clash.\r\n\r\nSee you there!","replies":[]}
