SO here is my question. IF I win a game for 15 p and lossing a game for 25 or even more. does it mean I have to go back to bronze and climb up again ?  It is so unbelievable for ur rank matching/allocating system. every time I tried so hard. my team mate just feed. I dont know how can I describe the feeling about ur matching system riot. Additionally I have to wait 10 min for a silver gold game average. what is wrong with your system?","replies":[{"poster":"Omni Presents","date":"2016-06-06T11:59:07.283+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"You do realise they screwed the system over when they changed it to a dynamic queue, right?\n\nIt is not just you, it is not just me either, it is happening to a LOT of players but no one wants to stand up and say there is a problem with the game for fear they will be ridiculed for saying something and be told it is only your fault, not that of your team.\n\nI have NEVER seen such bad games in the 5 years I have been here since they changed how the queue system works, even at the end of last season it was better than this shit I have been experiencing this season.","replies":[{"poster":"Exarch Leona","date":"2016-06-06T12:14:52.998+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thats not the problem. \nI've called it out multiple times.

In duo at least you could trust one other person to work as a team, instead of hoping for the luck you needed to take objectives. \n\nWith the addition of NCS and Dyna queue generally speaking teamwork is far more prevalent, and so many less games are lost in champ select because of fights over pick order vs call order/getting people stuck in roles they can't play. Even an uncoordinated premade has a better idea of what's going on with each other than 3/4/5 solos ever will. \n\nPerhaps it is a bit different for me, as a support main the teams movements dictate my own, rather than needing the team to follow me as frontliners do, or a team to work around me as carries do. Perhaps it is simply easier for support, as I can fit in with the premade team, rather than needing the team to fit around me (even in mid I tend to take a more utility centric role). Either way I am genuinely curious about the problems you have with Dyna queue.","replies":[{"poster":"Omni Presents","date":"2016-06-12T09:05:57.902+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I was the third person to say something against that video and most of what I read was nothing but negative around how shit this who thing is.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"BarryButcher","date":"2016-06-06T11:15:06.257+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"no what it means is your W/L record is appaling and you have destroyed your accounts MMR by losing so much.\n\nIn order to drop from Gold to Silver, you have to have the MMR of a Silver V account (roughly), so you must have lost a lot of games.\nYour gains and losses in terms of LP equal out when you have a 50% win rate and you gain more than you lose when you have a 55% + winrate.\n\nRight now you are sitting at 48% winrate, so you will losing more than you gain because the system believes, you are in an elo that is too hard for you so its trying to drop you down. Losing 14 of your last 20 will do that.\n\nYou currently have 16 more losses than wins. So basically you will have to go on a 16 game winning streak to make up for all the losses. or go 2 wins 1 loss for the next 40 games.\n\nStop playing Liss and go back to Viktor. You have a surprisingly good winrate with him.\n\nhttp://oce.op.gg/summoner/userName=Chyghvan","replies":[]},{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2016-06-12T03:00:19.786+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Basically you are losing more LP than you are gaining because the system thinks you are higher than you should be. If you aren't then you will prove the system wrong by still winning more games than you are losing, and you will climb. If you are higher than you should be then you will lose more than you win and fall. If you are about where you are supposed to be then you will be winning/losing basically 50/50.\n\nThis is prime time to take a step out of ranked, and go back to norms to practice, to focus on where you can improve, or at the very least to do the same in ranked. You've hit the point where you won't climb without improving, thus the best way for you to climb is to focus on improving rather than winning, because you as you improve, the wins will come on their own.","replies":[{"poster":"the raging blade","date":"2016-06-15T13:53:41.127+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hello again,\n\nI don't see any reason why would we ever do that to you. As my colleague mentioned earlier, we can't foresee if a player is going to troll or feed or AFK. There is no such technology for that.\n\nAs for AFK's, our automatic LeaverBuster system is implemented to discourage Summoners from repeatedly leaving matches and/or idling during gameplay. Suspensions and punishments are issued against Summoners that leave or idle in several games over a relatively short period of time. The LeaverBuster system bans chronic leavers and tracks and punishes users who continually leave their Teams.\n\nYou can find more about LeaverBuster in our Knowledge Base:\n\nhttps://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752714\n\nOn the other hand, can you provide me an evidence that you were matched with Challenger/Gold/Silver players?\n\nLastly, we don't disclose information about a player's sanction due to privacy.\n\nI think that if you aspire to get better, you should try to focus on what aspects of your own game you can improve rather than externalizing blame on the system and on your teammates.If you want to climb, focus on yourself. Tens of thousands of other players can do it and you know you can as well. Recognize that the first step starts with you!\n\nMaggieNoodle\nRiot Games Player Support\nWorst Viktor ever\n\n\nwhen the riot shity team reply me this i know that they r so lack the money to develp a good game? so go eat shit riot staff members, u r just here to disappoint every one","replies":[{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2016-06-15T15:06:52.797+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'm not entirely sure how that was relevant to what I posted, you may have been better off making your own thread, but League is a skill based game. To climb/get better you are going to have to improve your skill. The only context I have on what you sent to support is the way they responded to you, but it looks like a perfectly acceptable answer to me.\n\nIf you were asking if they were purposely matching you with people above your rank or who are going to troll/AFK then that isn't the case. Trolls/AFKs are fairly unpredictable quantities as far as the matchmaking system alone is concerned, and if you're versing people above your rank then it's because your mmr says you should be where they are and you would have high LP gains until you either got there or lost a whole bunch. A Bronze 4 will never vs a Challenger in ranked.\n\n> when the riot shity team reply me this i know that they r so lack the money to develp a good game?\n\nNothing in the ticket implies anything remotely close to that. Rather what it implies is that you sent a ticket to support claiming you were being placed with bad teammates and that it was stopping you from climbing, when the reality is that you need to stop focusing on your team and start focus on the common factor in all your games, namely YOU. Every player in every rank encounters trolls/dcs/afks/intent feeders.\n\nA brief look at your match history tells me you probably need to focus on limits and risks vs potential rewards (are you going to die and is it worth it?), and how to play from behind. Those kind of questions however are better directed at the instructors over on the Gameplay and Strategy board.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Erøse","date":"2016-06-13T06:47:19.743+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I feel like this is something to do with your mmr....\n\n\n\nOk, I just checked your mmr from oce.op.gg and it seems like your mmr is slightly lower than average which probably explains why you are getting silver team mates. Your mmr is 1,313 and the average mmr is 1,372. Mmr decides the rank of the people you go against and get matched up with. Also, work on your grammar and spelling.","replies":[]}]}
