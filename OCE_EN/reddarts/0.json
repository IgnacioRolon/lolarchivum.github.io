The time that you wait really depends on how long it takes for the rest of the players to get into the queue that you are currently in.\nI know it is not really fun waiting for match, and I was frustrated of waiting in the first place, but now I got used to it.\n\nYou can always choose to look away from the computer when you are in queue (I don't encourage you to do this if you are being invited into a game by your friend, or if you invite your friends to play with you). Inviting your friends to play can shorten the queue time.","replies":[]}]}
