I have a KDA with anivia of 3.8, KDA of 2.9 on Tahm Kench, 2.6KDA with Oriana. I play a lot of Syndra in norms but I dont have a ranked KDA for her, but i would estimate around 3.  I also play a lot of leona in norms and would estimate a KDA of around 3.2.  I am looking for **a serious ranked 5s team for season 6**.  I was placed in bronze 3 with winning 8/10 promos and then have been stuck in elo hell, however my mmr in norms pairs me up with gold/plat.  Please add me &quot;sprattyy&quot; and send me a message if you&#039;re interested in me playing in your team.  \r\n\r\nMy Lolking:\r\nhttp://www.lolking.net/summoner/oce/1553170#profile\r\n\r\nLet me know :)","replies":[]}
