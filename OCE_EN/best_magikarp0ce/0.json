Its been about 2 hours  now and I still can&#039;t reconnect back into the game. I thought by now the game would be over and i would able to proceed with another game, but there is only a reconnect option. I&#039;ve tried restarting my computer, relaunching the client, resetting my router and still nothing. Is anyone else having the same problem?","replies":[{"poster":"SephirothSG","date":"2016-05-08T02:02:11.330+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey there,\n\nSounds like you're experiencing what is known as a Ghost Game, these are caused when the client/server doesn't receive the proper \"End Game\" message.\n\nThese aren't something you can fix yourself, nor can Riot. You just have to wait it out, the issue will resolve itself within a couple hours.","replies":[]}]}
