In my opinion I think it would be a really great idea if every time a new season starts players that have used all of their refunds get a refund token in their account but it is only used on what you bought in that season. I think it would be great to add into the client and it would keep players happy. I hope this feature can be thought about and added in the future as it would be really cool to see.\r\nBut it is only just a thought.\r\n{{sticker:slayer-pantheon-thumbs}}","replies":[{"poster":"DipperOCE","date":"2018-02-19T08:16:45.920+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I started playing League in 2014 and people back then said the exact same things you said.
