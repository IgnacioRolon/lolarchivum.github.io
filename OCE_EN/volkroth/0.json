I&#039;ve noticed, actually, that if I leave that options app open, the screensaver works as normal... but the moment I close it, it forgets all the pics again.\r\n\r\nIt&#039;s frustrating, cause this is my favourite screensaver, and I love the league art. Anyone able to suggest a fix?","replies":[]}
