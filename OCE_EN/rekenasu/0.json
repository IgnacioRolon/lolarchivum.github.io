I have been matched with placement scrubs 5 games in a row now constantly trolling/feeding. They shouldn&#039;t be paired with s5 onwards. They are really destroying the fun in the damn game its impossible to climb constantly getting placement people with 1/6 ranked placements who have no idea about the fundamentals of the game. Please Riot fix the match making for people on their placements!{{champion:32}}","replies":[{"poster":"Tele","date":"2015-12-27T07:53:55.237+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"You're mistaken or exaggerating. It's the 2nd to last patch for pre-season, there's literally no point in starting ranked now. The number of people in placement matches isn't as high as you make it out to be. \n\nYour enemies will have this disadvantage as well in some games, take advantage in those.","replies":[]}]}
