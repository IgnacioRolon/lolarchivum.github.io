I have asked him to log into his forums account and sit next to my while I type this so that he approves. (Thank god he  agreed!)\r\nMy account is suspended for &quot;suspicious activity, and malicious changes.&quot; Which I made. I understand why they may see this as I have made a lot of changes on the account and changed the country I access it from. I have also changed my ISP which changes our IP address. I can see why they are a little suspicious about the access to my account. But they keep asking me to prove it&#039;s mine. I have proven its&#039;s mine and all was good, they unbanned me. Now it&#039;s banned again. untill the year 2100. (2100 ban is security related im very sure. It said so on google anyway.) \r\nhttp://boards.oce.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/player-behaviour/h33LTFGx-permanently-suspended-for-suspicious-activity\r\nIs my ticket made from my forums account; however I am not able to login to my forums account OR riot support account anymore because It says wrong password. I have made sure it&#039;s 100% the correct password and even did the forgot my password a few times.. Still can&#039;t get it. I know I have the right username, pass, and region. \r\nI am making this post because I am unable to access my support, forums, and league accounts. I need some help. I have already proved it&#039;s my account. I appreciate them caring but this is a little ridiculous. It&#039;s like the government kicking a family out of their house that they own outright and saying &quot;provide us proof you paid for the house&quot; and we will let you back in. Untill then you&#039;re living on the streets. and then not accepting the proof the family gives them. That&#039;s what it seems like to me anyway. :(\r\nI&#039;m so stick! Please take a look at the link to the forums post above; I will have to reply using my sons account and get him to login and sit next to me while I type these posts. (Not going to be a parent who asks their kids for their password for everything and controls it, just me though! I prefer him to be happy and let me type this rather than forcing him to let me.)\r\n\r\nSo I would like some help with my account { Reported4verbal } no &quot;}{&quot; in the name. \r\nPlease help me. I&#039;m really annoyed at this point :(.","replies":[{"poster":"Deep Terror Nami","date":"2016-02-20T10:41:40.166+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey Nicole27,\n\nYou can submit an [Account Recovery Support Ticket](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/requests/new?ticket_form_id=38154) without logging into the Support site. Please follow all of the steps below to regain control of your League of Legends account and reverse any unwanted actions that the individual who compromised your account may have taken:\n\n1. Run a complete anti-virus scan on your computer and remove any malware that is detected. If you don't have an anti-virus program, I recommend downloading either [**MalwareBytes Free**](https://www.malwarebytes.org/mwb-download/) or [**ESET NOD32 with a free 30 day trial**](http://download.eset.com/special/live-installer/us/eset_nod32_antivirus_live_installer.exe). Either or should be able to get the job done. \n\n2. Once the scans have run and any detections are removed, change any accounts/passwords that you believe may have been compromised. This may include your email account(s) and League of Legends account (if you still have access to it; if not, skip to the \"Submitting a ticket\" step). You can change your League of Legends password by going to the [**League of Legends account area**](https://account.leagueoflegends.com/na/en/protect) in the top-right corner of this page. Click on your summoner name, and select \"Settings\". In the box that comes up, click \"Change Password\" and follow said steps. (Make sure that your email account is secure before doing this step, as a confirmation email will be sent to the corresponding email account.)\n\n3. Now that your accounts are secure, it's time to contact Riot Games Player Support to deal with the unauthorized actions on your account and/or recovering your account. \n\n\nTo contact Riot Games Player Support, you'll need to [**submit a ticket on the Riot Games Support website**](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/requests/new?ticket_form_id=38154). In the ticket, please submit all the requested information along with whatever information you can provide about your situation: \n\n> ##**[NOTE: DO *NOT* POST THE INFORMATION ON THE BOARDS. SUBMIT THEM IN YOUR TICKET!]**\n\n Lastly, to increase your chances of a quick resolution to your request, follow the tips below the best that you can:\n \n1. Be sure to submit as much information in your initial ticket as possible. For obvious reasons, each Player Support Specialist's request for more information will delay the resolution of the issue.\n\n2. Be respectful and polite in your correspondences with Riot Support. (They're doing their best to help you!)\n\n3. Try not create a new ticket or respond to an existing ticket before a Player Support Specialist has had the chance to review your request. New tickets/replies may bump your ticket back to the bottom of the queue, thus increasing the amount of time before a Player Support Specialist is able to review your ticket.  \n \nI know that there are quite a bit of steps listed above, so if you have any questions, please don't hesitate to ask. Best of luck!\n\nPlease visit the [Protecting Your Account](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201751664-Protecting-Your-Account) and [Recovering Your Account](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201751694-Recovering-Your-Account) articles for more information.\n\n-DTN","replies":[{"poster":"Nicole27","date":"2016-02-22T14:13:02.648+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey,\nI got a reply. They said \" know that you are confused as to why we can no longer release this account to you. We've recently made an investigation and found a solid evidence that you are a secondary user of this account. There were also discrepancies of the information you provided. I am sorry, but there's nothing much that i can do for you in this matter\n\nI know 100% as true as I am sitting here right now, I am deffinetley not a \"secondary user\" i find it offensive she says that when I am such a loyal customer to trn around and ban me and say \"sorry you changed a lot of your account details all at once, seems a bit excessive. We are banning you.\"\nHow do I prove that I am not a secondary user? \nI also gave her lots of information i know is correct such as paypal transaction id's. I could even send her screenshots of the page where I purchased rp. I also filled out their usal information quizz and am sure most is right. I also offered heaps of other info that I can remember. I was working with her and she turns around and says pretty much \"no, youre a secondary user.\" \nI changed a lot of the account info recentley, and changed countries, and then changed isp again. This is about the only thing that I think may cause suspicion, if it is. It isnt \"solid evidance\" though.\nI have a friend who got his account hacked once and they started playing games on his account and feeding to get him banned (very sure thats not happening to me, match history no different, also dont think someone else would have even logged in to my account, password is hard to guess.

I appreciate you for trying to help. But I know you have contact to riot as you told me in the in game client chat. Could you please ask them? I am a bit worried about my account. I can't even log in to the forums and support page it says wrong password. I don't see how they keep banning me. I know it's my account and I keep having to provide heaps of info to prove I own it. Excuse my language, but they should just let people play the god damn game and stop locking their accounts because riot think someone is using it. \nI agree that there looks like suspicious activity on my account as I have moved country and transferred the account to several emails and logged in with several ip's. However those Ip's are from the same house. Just a different ISP, even my data from my phone.\n\nI can't see the \"last activity\" bit. Just hoping for an email. Been over 24 hours.
