I keep feel like I keep going around in circles with the support team, they are nice and helpful for sure, but I am not getting anything and it&#039;s just circles we are going in.\r\nSo once again, I am using my sons account (this one) with my son sitting next to me to type this as I can&#039;t access anything related to league of legends. I am completely locked out.\r\nThey said to me that they are having trouble verifying that I own the account. I gave them heaps of information they wanted, plus I suggested I could give a whole heap of other info, such as messages I have sent in game that I remember, friends on my list, skins and champs on the account, champs I play most, and heaps more. The reply was that there was &quot;discrepancies&quot; in the information I gave them required for recovery. They need to prove I own it and they said it looks like I am a &quot;secondary user of the account&quot;\r\nI know for sure I am the only one to play on the account and am willing to do anything to prove it because I know I am not a &quot;secondary user&quot;.\r\n\r\nI am very stuck and I want my account back, after all, it&#039;s just a game and feel like I am being treated horrible, especially when I am a loyal customer\r\nI have spent over 2 thousand dollars on this game for myself, friends and my son.\r\n\r\nSo I really need help. Please someone.\r\nMy forums post is at the top of this message, the link up there^\r\n\r\nThanks in advance. Please help me :(","replies":[]}
