I keep feel like I keep going around in circles with the support team, they are nice and helpful for sure, but I am not getting anything and it&#039;s just circles we are going in. \r\nSo once again, I am using my sons account (this one) with my son sitting next to me to type this as I can&#039;t access anything related to league of legends. I am completely locked out.\r\nThey said to me that they are having trouble verifying that I own the account. I gave them heaps of information they wanted, plus I suggested I could give a whole heap of other info, such as messages I have sent in game that I remember, friends on my list, skins and champs on the account, champs I play most, and heaps more. The reply was that there was &quot;discrepancies&quot; in the information I gave them required for recovery. They need to prove I own it and they said it looks like I am a &quot;secondary user of the account&quot; \r\nI know for sure I am the only one to play on the account and am willing to do anything to prove it because I am extremely confident I am not a &quot;secondary user&quot; especially with the amount of actual money I&#039;ve spent on the game. \r\n\r\nI am very stuck and I want my account back, after all, it&#039;s just a game and they are kind of treating it like I want to get into fort knox and find the original recipe and the secret herbs and spices haha].\r\n\r\nBut I know for sure I made the account and am not a second user, as true as I  swear on it as true as i am sitting here typing this (and an aussie wouldn&#039;t misuse that saying!)\r\n\r\nSo I really need help. Please someone.\r\nMy forums post is at the top of this message, the link up there^\r\n\r\nThanks in advance. Please help :(","replies":[{"poster":"TrashDonnut","date":"2016-02-23T10:19:56.028+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Email confirmation should solve it all, if you've done that; i don't know what else.","replies":[{"poster":"Nicole27","date":"2016-02-23T20:24:06.970+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hi,\nI have reset my passwords to my email, and it worked.
