Yes, it is a reasonable argument. But lets review the point you've made and break it down in 2 chunk. The native perma banned players, and the oversea students. \n\n1st. The players that is coming over from china's server. A popular believe is because they have been perma banned and wanting to start over. Lets go with that for now, for simplistic sake.\n\nThose players that have lost their prestige in the forms of money invested, ranking rewards, ETC... They already have nothing to lose, so the chances of them coming here to cause havoc is high. But! the percentage of their numbers isn't. People in general are not willing to go to a different server with many barriers. Such as langue, higher pings, friends are not with them, just so they can rage at the populace and not get ban.\n\nHow many of you are willing to go to their server and extract your revenge the same way?? Again, a **small **handful. Not worth mentioning.\n\n2nd. The oversea students who is coming over to study. There are a lot more of them than the 1st scenario. It take time for those kids to integrate and learn English. So in the mean while, they will use what they know. \n\nLet us look at how many of them will actually be toxic. This is the focal point.** Is anyone here willing to provide me with the evidence**, that the **majority **of them is behaving badly. Or are you guys cherry picking a few cases and narrate it down to chinese as the masses. To say that they are the primary concern, is the same as saying, they as a race/culture are the problem. And if that is the statement. Then provide the evidence to go with it. \n\nYou don't make a huge claim as such, and have no statistic to back it up.\n\nIf you have the problem with the individual.

Admittedly, this wasn't the best presentation of the issue.\n\nHowever the gross negligence and refusal to admit the problem is possibly the largest driver of this animosity.

It just simply isn't the topic of this particular discussion.  The topic of the discussion is that \"Chinese people are the problem.\" \n\nThe title here is \"Chinese ruining the game ...again\", not \"Why is profanity in other languages deemed less offensive than English?\"  That is a very valid discussion for sure, and one I'm happy to have with you if you want, but it isn't _this_ discussion.\n\nThe discussion posed by OP is clearly about \"who\" is ruining the game, not \"what\" or \"how\".  Just because we are defending the view that it's not 'Chinese people' at fault, doesn't mean that we defend the use of the Chinese language being used for toxicity _(by anyone, Chinese or otherwise)._\n\nUsing the language was only a small part of OP's point.  The majority of his post was listing a bunch of behavioural issues that pretty much all player demographics produce, and trying to attribute them to one specific race.  So from what we can see here, the racist attitude seems to be the more pressing issue in this _particular_ thread.\n\nSo having at go at us for not specifically talking about something that isn't the direct topic of the discussion seems a little unfounded.\nIt's like having a go at politicians for not discussing poverty, while at a global warming summit.\n\nUsing the Chinese language (or any other) to navigate detection software, is one issue.

You continue to discuss the symptom and not the cause.\n\nSome proponents of this conversation are somewhat mislead in their outcomes, I have already and will continue to admit this. However the problem isn't Chinese people, it's the use of Chinese as a way to avoid banning and Riot's continued biased moderation on this matter.\n\nI am not going to delve into discuss whether the people using Chinese profanity are actually banned players from Garena server, or are OCE localised players trying to childishly incite anger and racial tensions whilst giggling about the lack of consequence to their behaviors. In all likelihood a mix of both.\n\nWhat is causing this level of response however, is the fact that by use of Chinese profanity, players have made themselves exempt from judgement. They are allowed a position of power over other players, and allowed to ignore the strict code of conduct other players must follow. Furthermore, any attempt to create reasonable discussion on this manner is attacked for racism and trimmed or removed by moderation. This isn't about racism, anyone can throw some swear words into google translate and copy paste, and ofc if you get the banned overflow from another server, it will seem objectively more toxic. If you took the most toxic 1% of any server, no matter which server, they would look the same.\n\nAnd yet still, this matter has had to be brought forth, time and time again, and nothing has been done. Discussion on resolution has not even been broached. Surely GARENA has a profanity filter we could borrow? Yet, still the problem persists, and the thoughtless righteous, have again misidentified the issue and dismissed it. Unaware or even considerate of the underlying cause.\n\nWith problem resolution, it's not about the symptoms, but the underlying cause.\nand sometimes to learn this, you need to play devils advocate.","replies":[{"poster":"Lord Sesshomaru","date":"2019-05-14T05:21:45.815+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I mean, I haven't missed the point.\nQuite simply because this discussion is quite genuinely and obviously about the symptom, not about the cause.\n\nI agree being able to swear in Chinese with less punishment is a problem, I've already said I agree with you, several times.  If you go and make a post about that, then I'll come and support your view.  However, someone else made this thread, and clearly they are more worried about the race of the offenders rather than the method of offending.  So naturally, I'm going to respond to that particular point.\n\nUnless your Garena chat filter will fix (and I quote):\n> always holding other people hostage by playing bad refusing to surrender. -- giving them advice , they will ignore it and continue to feed. -- usually they are party up as 2 or more people ( they are too bad for solos).\n\nThen perhaps it isnt the most relavent topic for this particular thread.\nBecsuse, once again, this thread isn't about using the Chinese language for swearing.  It's about Chinese people ruining the server.  Yes the two issues have a crossover, but one isn't the other.\n\nAgreed it's frustrating to see symptoms treated, and not the cause. But sometimes symptoms can't be ignored either.  The cause of a bad cut may be a sharp knife, but right now the knife laying motionless on the counter is less of an immediate threat than the blood pouring from your finger.  The blood isn't the cause of the injury, but keeping it inside you takes priority in that particular moment.\n\nKids swearing and giggling at each other in a language neither of them understand, is less of an issue right this second, than a clear and very public attack on a particular demographic of the playerbase.\n\nFocusing on a racist comment here, doesn't make your issue any less important.  But it isn't as relavent to this specific scenerio, which is why people have focused their efforts on stopping this strain of racist attitude from spreading, instead of looking at swearing.\n\n> any attempt to create reasonable discussion on this manner is attacked for racism and trimmed or removed by moderation.\n\nI would hardly call anything in this thread \"Reasonable Discussion.\"? If this post is what you consider appropriate discussion on the matter of avoiding chat filters, then I overestimated you.\n\nI can guarantee you, if you create a concise well worded and clearly articulated point, with evidence about the issues of having less chat restriction on other languages. And not outright attack anyone's race or culture (as OP did).  You'll have nothing to fear from moderators.\nNo one wants to be sworn at in any language.\n\n> This isn't about racism, \n\nMost of the time I would agree. Throwing words into Google isn't racism.  But this particular post is very much about racism, and that's what people are responding to here.\n\n> you need to play devils advocate.\n\nI find it amusing that you call me of all people out on not playing devils advocate.\n\nAll in all, people are often uncomfortable with what they don't understand.  And the sad truth is that most of us don't know any language other than English.  Having someone throw a language you don't know at you makes people uncomfortable, wether it's swearing or not.\nIf I say to you: 多分、あなたは美しい人ですね。chances are without google you won't know what I said.  I could be asking for a gank, or calling your mother something unsavoury.  I know what I said to you, and unless you've studied the same language, you probably don't.  That makes a lot of people uncomfortable.  It makes them feel small, or stupid.  And naturally they act defensively.  That's the base mindset that we have to deal with, and you have to tread carefully or else you'll make that worse.\n\nThat's why you can't jump into these matters the way OP did.  It doesn't promote any kind of reasonable discussion.  You have to approach your issue tactfully and without making people feel small and unsafe.  OP is clearly afraid of what he doesn't understand, and his defence mechanism is to go on the attack. And look what that achieved... \n\nMake your point well, and without jumping to conclusions, and you'll be much more successful.","replies":[{"poster":"Nightjar","date":"2019-05-15T03:22:50.314+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I decided to jump into this hellhole of a comment section, even if the original post isn't good, because these threads are often very transient, pruned very quickly, regardless of quality, or at least they used to be?

Pick your moments. ^^\n\nIf you started a thread years ago about the problem, I wouldn't relate it to nowadays.  I'd start a new thread (when this post has died off).  We have different moderators, a different community, hell the game itself is nearly unrecognisable from a few years ago.\n\n-----------------------------------------\n\n**Using language to avoid chat filters.**\n\nAnd it may not be quite as simple as \"Just block X swear words in X language\".  As you mentioned before, romanised versions add a whole new landscape.  I don't know much about Chinese, but let's look at Japanese for a second. Take my name: Sesshomaru.\n\nIt can be written like this:\n\n殺生丸\nせっしょうまる\nセッショウマル\nSesshoumaru\nSesshōmaru\nSesshomaru\n\nEvery single one is viable. And if you want to put \"Lord\" into it as well, then you can start combining different lettering too.\n\n殺生丸公\n殺生丸こう\n殺生丸コー\nせっしょうまる公\nせっしょうまるこう\nせっしょうまるコー\nセッショーマル公\nセッショーマルこう\nセッショーマルコー\n\nWhen said, they're exactly the same.\nOr get trickier again, and do something like:\n\n殺生まる公\nせっしょう丸こう\n殺生まるコー\nEtc.\n\nNow we are getting into the realm of there being too many combinations for me to type out.  So you can see how this would be an issue for any detection system.\n\nYou can also translate just sound, but no meaning to fool an AI system. Eg:\n\nユー シト フェース バスタード\nThat doesn't mean anything in Japanese. But if you say it:\n\"Yuu shito feesu basutaado\"\n\nHow are you going to stop something like that?\nIt's not technically a swear in either English or Japanese.\nAnd that's just ONE language to think about.  And no doubt there are other concerns to think about as well.\n\n---------------------------------------\n\nSo while I'm completely with you on finding a solution to using other languages to bypass systems.  It may not be as easy as slapping another server's filter over it.\n\nIt could well be one of the reasons why it hasn't been their top priority thus far.  I'd solve world hunger if I could!  That's definetly higher on my priority list than where I'm going to have dinner tonight.  Yet tonight, I will be solving my own hunger, not the world's, despite it not being the highest priority. The effort involved is just so great.  In the hour between 7 and 8. I am capable of solving my hunger, and I'm not capable of solving hunger in Africa.  So I'm going to solve the problem I can solve. \n\nI'm not putting words in Riot's mouth, but they may have a similar issue.  If they really wanted to, they probably could solve this problem.  But there's a LOT wrong with this game.  And people using a language they don't understand to insult people who don't understand it, may not be the most pressing issue among those many things.","replies":[{"poster":"Nightjar","date":"2019-05-15T09:54:15.817+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"yeah you've cited how people could get around the filter, it's certainly quite easy, but I think it still begs the question, why isn't there some basic level of filter already in place?\n\nIf I decided to look up say, a pirated anime on a 3ds, I could certainly do so, there is only so much nintendo can do, but it isn't as simple as typing it into google and clicking the first result.\n\nIf I decided to play on a different server whilst on holiday, if you swear in that server's native language, you'll get banned for certain phrases, but if I copy and paste that same phrase into a server with a different native language, hey viola nothing get's flagged at all.\n\nI'm not saying, Riot needs to go to great lengths to create the best all encompassing chat filter ever, but it seems counter intuitive to not sync the profanity filters across servers.","replies":[{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2019-05-15T13:19:02.061+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"This largely comes down to how the system functions.\n\n[THIS](https://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/player-behavior-moderation/Ifb0rpEJ-riot-should-just-make-a-list-of-banned-words-and-how-not-to-be-condescending) thread does a good job of outlining the basics of the system, why filtering words is largely futile, but also how the system gets around that.\n\nConsider this: It's generally accepted that things like 'sb' and 'cao ni ma' are toxic, even if the reporting player doesn't understand exactly what they mean. These words get consistently reported, and so the system learns that this is negative behaviour and it shows. It's pretty obvious that such language is recognised by the system now, I certainly get enough feedback reports for it.\n\nNow consider this: [Insert Chinese characters here] means nothing to most people. Those that speak the language will know it's toxic and report it, but that's a small(ish) percentage of players. You might review and report before leaving post game, but not a lot of people would. \n\nYou can add specific words or phrases to a filter, but there are so many different ways and characters to say things in Mandarin/Canto there's no way you'll catch even most, and the system can't learn what's toxic on any sort of reasonable timeline because so few people are reporting when it is.\n\nMind you, those people who aren't reporting are also unaware of the toxicity and so can't really be affected by it for the most part.\n\nThe reason they don't sync more than the basics across servers is because what's accepted or not varies from server to server. A lot of the stuff allowed on OCE would get you at least chat restricted on NA. Mum jokes are a huge no-no in a lot of asian countries (China in particular), whereas here they are accepted as just jokes in certain contexts.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Lord Sesshomaru","date":"2019-05-15T13:18:38.213+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Oh I agree, it makes no sense that words banned in one server are allowed on another.\n\nLike I can understand cultural differences 'Baka' for example is much more light hearted in English than in Japanese.
