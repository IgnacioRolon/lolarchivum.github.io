KDA means very little in the greater scheme of things. If I'm playing support and the toplane teemo is getting 5 man camped and is still managing to hold his towers somehow with shrooms despite dying repeatedly whilst we're securing inhibitors and dragons; I still consider him mvp for keeping 5 people up there and basically winning us the game.\n Also what about when buffing and cc supports put themselves on the line to hard carry compared to when they stand back and just buff from a distance enough to get the assist. When the soraka does most damage on the team and puts out silences and slows during teamfights compared to when she sits back and just heals occasionally. When that janna helps makes picks and throws herself into a teamfight to perform the winning typhoon ult. What about that splitpush jax who went 1-6-2 but solo took 8 towers, 3 inhibs and a dragon. He might not have gotten kills but the gold and map pressure he earned was well worth it.\n\nConsidering game performance purely by kda is a very bronze thing to do.
