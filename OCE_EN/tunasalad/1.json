At this point i knew it was time for them to stop and suggested we play some overwatch or head out somewhere instead.\r\n\r\nI find this concerning, bronze and silver are the new players of the game, how are they expected to grow when they get stomped by higher elo players?  and I question the well-being of players in that part of the ladder, in conjunction with the health of the game.","replies":[{"poster":"Slowdownn","date":"2016-05-30T08:48:21.518+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"1. I think smurfing is universally accepted for this game. Remember they can be on either side. It is the match making that is ruining ranked at the moment. In B4-5, the difference in player's ability can be varied and as long as the yolo system doesn't improve then we may never have evenly matched game plays. By improving the system, I meant other then being carried out from these tiers, players should be able to raise in rank by playing consistently good and gaining points even with loses.","replies":[]},{"poster":"JesusForgotHisGA","date":"2016-05-30T06:00:36.444+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"There's nothing they can really do about and if there was I doubt they would implement anything. I mean why would they? Smurfs or what not people are still playing the game, populating servers and at the end of it all more likely to spend money on RP etc.\n\nWelcome to F2p. If people actually had to pay for an account or key rather than simply creating a new one things would be a lot different.
