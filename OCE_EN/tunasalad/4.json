The point is you shouldn't be in low elo at all. **the player has been playing for at least 4 years**\n\n\nif you're in bronze I question if the account was boosted? \nhas the account been sold?\nhas the account been shared?\nor has it been dropped in elo intentionally?\n\n\nA side question to this would also be, Has riot OCE ever looked into legacy accounts?\n\n","replies":[{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2017-01-05T14:49:08.621+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"There are people who have played for 4-5 years and remain in Bronze, never having gotten out despite playing regularly.\n\nSome people learn faster than others, some people have the wrong mindset, some people lose the mindset they need to do well, some people lose skill faster or slower than others. The skill gap between high Bronze and low Gold isn't *that* large, and League is almost a completely different game than it was just a couple years ago (especially for jungle and support).\n\nIf it was S5 Gold and S6 Bronze then yeah that's hella sus, but S3 Gold to S6 Bronze is entirely believable.\n\nAs for if they have been playing over that time, maybe they have a medical condition that means deteriorating reaction time or coordination, or maybe they had an injury that impairs their gameplay, or maybe they just lucked/duo'd their way to gold the first time and really belong in mid-low silver given there's no decay below plat.\n\nAs for things like account selling, yes they do look into it, and yes it does get caught. Old/inactive accounts tend to be the targets for compromise, since the owner may not notice straight away, and since we see posts pop up here on boards to the effect of \"I haven't played for 3 years why is my account banned?\" it's safe to assume even those old accounts get investigated.","replies":[]}]}]}]}
