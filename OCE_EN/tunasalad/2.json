Not many people solo queue in flex (that's what solo/duo is for) so finding that 5th for 4 man premades takes a phenomenal amount of time. Draft pick doesn't have that issue because the queue isn't split so 4 mans are allowed.","replies":[{"poster":"Nightjar","date":"2018-02-27T11:21:55.563+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"eh it's flex queue, anyone who queues solo for flex queue isn't really taking it very seriously, and is likely using it as a secondary system to soloq. I queue up for flex queue as a solo more often than I do as a team, as it allows me to try out new picks in a slightly lower ranked environment. \n\nAlso you'd be surprised but overall toxicity is much much lower in flex queue (people probably don't want to look like an ass in front of their premade buddies). Even when my friends have been playing blitzcrank jungle, illaoi adc, swain jg in flex queue, nobody has called them out for it, or even gotten very toxic, from what I've seen, players in flex queue find it quite novel provided you perform well.","replies":[{"poster":"Tunasalad","date":"2018-02-27T11:30:25.857+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Might actually give it a go.\n\nwhile i understand draft is warmup/chill play. it can be frustrating playing with god awful picks. if its a slight step down from ranked like you say it may be worth while to play solo in flex and see how it goes compared to normal draft pick.\n\nThanks mate :)","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Tunasalad","date":"2018-02-27T11:06:15.917+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"but its very unpleasant to play as a solo player in it. \neven as a duo, if you are vsing 4-5 man premades. its brutal.\n\nits even worse if you are matched as the solo player with a 4 man vs a 5 man.\n\n","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Destruktorxp","date":"2018-12-09T22:42:09.542+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It is disabled for very simple reason. 4 guys could make troll surrender and the 5th would lose because bunch of 10 years trolls.","replies":[]}]}
