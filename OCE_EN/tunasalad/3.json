Now don&#039;t deny it. you get mad at this person for losing you the match or feeding or whatever on your main account, well guess what. you are part of that problem in addition you are also placing your friend in that environment to receive abuse or worse. you are setting up your friend for failure, for abuse and for a negative experience in the game. and ultimately denying them the chance to become as good as you are.\n\nSmurfing is not helping the server improve, you are killing it instead.\n","replies":[{"poster":"Dunkmaster Vi","date":"2016-03-08T23:52:34.237+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"smurfing is when you make a new account and start fresh\n\nwhat you are describing is boosting\n\ndoesn't change the fact i am against boosting though but calling it smurfing is misleading.","replies":[{"poster":"TrashDonnut","date":"2016-03-09T07:44:56.383+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"^ Pretty much what is being said.","replies":[{"poster":"Tunasalad","date":"2016-03-09T11:44:27.819+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":4,"body":"Thanks for your imput mate, do you have anything else to contribute to the discussion?","replies":[{"poster":"TrashDonnut","date":"2016-03-11T09:47:39.928+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"What do you mean \"contribute\".\n\nYour post literally doesn't make sense.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Tunasalad","date":"2016-03-09T11:33:10.551+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":3,"body":">smurfing is when you make a new account and start fresh\n\n>what you are describing is boosting\n\n>doesn't change the fact i am against boosting though but calling it smurfing is misleading.\n\n\nI've called it smurfing for 2 main reasons\n\n1. higher ranked players make these accounts just to stomp. \n2. they also use them in a way i described above.\n\nYou can combine the 2 terms of players if you like, the problem still remains, there are alot of higher ranked players making gold/silver and bronze games a negative experience\n\nBut yes \"free-boosting\" is common, and whatever you want to call it, its a problem\n\n\nDerailing aside, do you have anything else to add on this topic?","replies":[]}]}]}
