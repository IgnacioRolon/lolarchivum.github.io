I was wondering if anyone with Dodo or iPrimus has experienced the same issue. I&#039;m currently unable to connect to servers, because it disconnected me whilst in a game.","replies":[{"poster":"IngÃ©nue","date":"2016-04-01T14:05:20.941+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> Hi all,\n\n>Tonight we'll be performing a brief network maintenance to remove one of our peering partners at 1am AEDT. Players on iiNet, Spark, Dodo, iPrimus and potentially other ISPs are likely to experience a brief disconnect from games in progress around that time.\n\n>This is a follow-up from last nights issues, and will allow the partner to perform maintenance to their network to prevent it happening in the future.\n\n>Please keep an eye on this thread and the server status page for any updates.\n\n>Cheers\nMindstar\n\n[source](http://boards.oce.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/announcements/yWTUfB8G-live-network-maintenance-1am-aedt-2nd-april)","replies":[]}]}
