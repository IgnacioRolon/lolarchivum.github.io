Again, your title, 'pro tip: don't update to the new client', doesn't even suggest that you're saying to upgrade later. Also, if you are just complaining about something, it is whining. No clubs? I'm sure that you found a solution to that situation.\nStop whining about the new client, it's way better than the legacy client","replies":[]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Riot martlet","date":"2016-11-11T00:36:21.826+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey, when we went to OCE we didn't have clubs on but it should be there now when you log back in.
