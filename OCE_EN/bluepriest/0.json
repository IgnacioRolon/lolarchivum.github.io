It had some balance issues, but overall it wasnt too bad. Is the balance pretty good right now? I know that league is balanced around 5s, so I dont expect it to be perfect (heck, 5s balance isnt perfect) but is it at a pretty decent spot right now, or is it terrible?\n\nedit \n\nif theres any major 3s players out there reading this, and you know of a good guide to follow up on (Sam was the man when I was playing, and had a tier list and everything for 3s), then that would be awesome","replies":[]}
