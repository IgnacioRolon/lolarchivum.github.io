How ironic. I have contacted riot many times and they will not lift it and say they are going to close my ticket. Do you guys think I should be banned for telling someone to not say kys?","replies":[{"poster":"LevvyLeviticus","date":"2018-01-05T22:17:01.103+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"i saw the chat log below, and tbh it more looks like a chat restriction/14 day ban than a perma ban, the bot is kinda out of control","replies":[]},{"poster":"Niji","date":"2018-01-06T00:46:44.282+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"God its so low iq that Riot never gives the chat logs of anyone else in these cases. If I got reported I'd want to know what I responded to or when ppl post here and can only give their side. Heck if Riot is afraid of name and shame just make other summoners appear as their champions names or names like Summoner 1, Summoner 2, etc.\n\nAlso the chat is ran by a bot these days so if you say one of the nono words kys, [slur for race], [slur for gays] and many more then the bot just gives you instant 14 day or if you had a 14 day before instant perma.\n\nRiot support of course sticks by this when imo context really should matter. No, Riot doesn't care, if you say any of those words and get reported no matter what no ban overturn.","replies":[]},{"poster":"esp","date":"2018-01-05T19:24:46.019+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Going to need more info bro. If it was one game that you only said, \"saying kys will get you banned\" then no. Key word ONLY. If there was nothing else said to get triggered by the report system then no, You shouldn't be punished for it. Even if there was slightly bad behavior during that game I don't think it should punishable by a perm ban.\n\nAs I had put in my thread they can take a lot of things out of context and use it against you to say \"you're punishment is justified, you said this and that\". So.. You're going need to elaborate more on the circumstances.\n\nI'd also like to tell you that they are going to say you've had lots of reports on this account and that the penalties that get issues for permanent bans are manual reviews (not done by bots). Though, I can't confirm the legitimacy of this. I've heard a lot of stories on people being permed for ridiculous reasons and as you said so yourself, riot close tickets. Personally I don't think they care, especially in OCE. If they had just had tribunal when they moved servers 4 seasons ago. No one would have complained about toxicity and no would be complaining about unfair judgement by their BOT. It would be community reviews not riot and not riots bot. It's biased.","replies":[{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2018-01-06T01:54:45.082+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":">no would be complaining about unfair judgement by their BOT\n\nThe players decide what to report.

I can't see the other guys reply so it really does seem like you said kys as a way to offend them. If you mean that one player asked you what will get me banned and you replied kys.. wellp you kind of fucked of yourself over there as it wasnt in a sentence so yeah it can be assumed.\n\nDon't think there's much you can do except keep sending in tickets to explain the situation more and hope they are feeling sympathetic.
