I tried to play a game of intermediate bots for my first win of the day twice and got 4 afk the first time and 4 feeding bots the second time.\nI know this is the &quot;player behaviour&quot; section but it&#039;d be awesome if i actually got to play with actual living human behavioured thingies. Good job on keeping these folks out of normal mode though.\n\nOne more note: I'm finding that the aram bots have got an upgrade. They're now able to carry games and do all sort of really cool stuff, like attack moving and spamming abilities, but never use summoner spells and all disconnect at the same time. They're noticeably bots but since they do well sometimes, they probably aren't getting banned.\n\n\nCommon characteristics (if this helps any bit with detection)\n1. Summoners are never used (normally they take mark/ghost or mark/flash)\n2. They act a bit like scripters\n3. Most if not all have the first icon\nhttp://vignette4.wikia.nocookie.net/leagueoflegends/images/5/5c/ProfileIcon01.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20110527180005 \n4. They disconnect at the same time\n5. They have multiple periods of idling \n6. They don't like hitting turrets (I think they have the same priority of hitting things)\n\n7. Generally, they don't play anything other than the free champs\n\n8. Not awfully bright\n\n9. Zero chat presence (When the game ends, they've already left the lobby before I've even entered)\n\n10. No use of jokes, taunt, laugh, dance\n\n11. I'm tempted to use these \nhttp://%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%\nhttp://www.elitepvpers.com/forum/league-legends-guides-strategies/3283525-eng-howto-free-ip-farm-playing-without-doing-anything.html\nknowing I'll get away with it\n","replies":[{"poster":"OCE Yisus","date":"2016-07-11T08:56:34.274+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"The most annoying thing with them - perfect synergy\n\nThey know the absolute perfect times where we have no summonsers and hit all 5 of us with a Wombo 100% of the time","replies":[{"poster":"TheOneUser","date":"2016-07-11T11:11:38.370+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"lol","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"JasonWazza","date":"2016-07-11T02:20:36.432+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":">They're noticeably bots but since they do well sometimes, they probably aren't getting banned.\n\nMeh most bots don't get banned anyway.","replies":[{"poster":"Gehirn","date":"2016-07-11T03:59:46.414+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"There have been far fewer bots these past few months due to improved detection and banning methods.
