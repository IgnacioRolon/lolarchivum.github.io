We have a pretty decent OCE community over in Summoners' Society which is part of our bigger Aus PC Gaming community. We have a Facebook group https://www.facebook.com/groups/SummonersSocietyOCE/ and people are always looking for others to get games going with. We recently started up a Discord server too. It's really new but I have seen people using the LoL channels already. We have some community nights & streams planned in the near future (where we will also be giving aspiring casters a chance to get out there and have a go). Then as the year gets going some looking for team/ team match up based community comps and LoL based productions. We were really active a year or so ago then had a break, but things have starting growing again really quickly and all are welcome. If you are keen, check it out. \n{{sticker:slayer-pantheon-thumbs}}","replies":[]}]}
