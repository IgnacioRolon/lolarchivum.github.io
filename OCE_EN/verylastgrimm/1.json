None of them were competent. He left his throne and the royal life to defend those from Dragons and the original team of slayers were determined, strong and some of the best fighters in the world. But as they fell, the numbers dwindled, the fight against dragons was once needed again and the dragon slayers came back to arms. However the newcomers were not as talented as the experienced Dragonslayers. Yes experience came with time but none of the new Trainees showed outstanding potential. They may had been adept at fighting humans or wolves but none showed that they could match a Dragon&rsquo;s might by themselves or even with a team around them. \r\n\r\nJarvan got up from his tent, he had to train them again and hopefully he will see some improvement. As he got ready, a flapping noise was heard, signalling him someone had entered his tent. He turned around to see a muscular man, he recognized it immediately as the signature mustache the man took care of was a clear giveaway.\r\n\r\n&ldquo;Greetings Braum, what brings you to my tent, training doesn&#039;t start for another 10 minutes&rdquo; Jarvan spoke.\r\n\r\nBraum chuckled &ldquo;the leader was always about business wasn&#039;t he.&rdquo;\r\n\r\n&ldquo;I&#039;ve come to deliver a little surprise, we have a l-&rdquo; Braum abruptly stopped mid sentence. He noticed a&hellip;. Distressed look on Jarvan face. Braum could sense it Jarvan&rsquo;s frustration, he had heard many times after training the new dragonslayers the cusses and swears he spew out like a drunken bilgewater native.\r\n\r\n&ldquo;Everything alright Jarvan, you seem distracted&rdquo; Braum inquired. If he was thinking about a personal matter Braum wish not to pry into Jarvan&rsquo;s personal life.\r\n\r\n&ldquo;Yeah Yeah&rdquo; Jarvan spoke quietly. &ldquo;It&#039;s just that&hellip;. For once in recent history, I fear the dragonslayers may be at a disadvantage. Our new line of trainees aren&rsquo;t as anywhere near as good as our last batch and we are running low on numbers as it is. I fear that we may not be able to defend those who need it&rdquo;\r\n\r\nBraum gave Jarvan a hearty laugh &ldquo;You know, you should have more faith in them,&rdquo; Braum sat down on the stool in Jarvan&rsquo;s tent. The feeble thing creaking under his weight.\r\n\r\n&ldquo;What you look for fighting talent but what you should be looking for is heart and passion&rdquo; Braum stated in his normal cheerful voice.\r\n Jarvan just sighed, &ldquo;its not that easy. We put our heart and guts into them and we get no results. Its frustrating.&rdquo;\r\n\r\n&ldquo;Well, there are talented soldiers who wouldn&#039;t fight dragons correct?&rdquo; Braum asked Jarvan. Jarvan nodded, wondering where Braum was going with this.\r\n&ldquo;Well, where are they? Some of the best fighters runeterra has to offer are standing to the side in the fight against dragons. With these new serpent like creations, we need numbers more than ever but where are the fighters. See what i&#039;m saying Jarvan, one may be good at fighting, but one isn&#039;t as valuable as one with courage&rdquo; Braum finished feeling on high after his speech.\r\n\r\nJarvan smirked, &ldquo;You know how to always make light of a bad situation. Also what was the news you came to deliver, its about time we greet the Trainees.&rdquo;\r\n\r\n&ldquo;Ah yes, you see there was a late recruit. He came in last night and we think he may be the next top general&rdquo; Braum said, watching Jarvan face lightened a little.\r\n\r\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n\r\n&ldquo;Ok Trainees, we will be practicing basic strikes. This time however, Braum and Pantheon will be running your training whilst i tend to the new trainee here&rdquo; Jarvan said as he gestured to the new trainee.\r\n \r\nThe new Trainees was someone that Jarvan recognised but couldnt put his finger on it.  His hair was done up in a ponytail, and his weapon of choice was his spear with 3 talons acting as the spearhead. The man had a stance, showing he was ready for anything, anyone.\r\n\r\nJarvan dismissed the trainees before turning to the new Trainees. &ldquo;You ready Trainee, Im not allowed to go easy on you hope you know&rdquo;\r\n\r\n&ldquo;I don&#039;t expect you to Sir Jarvan&rdquo; the voice spoke. The feeling of this person being familiar nagged Jarvan, but he couldn&#039;t think of who. It was a demarician but that&#039;s all he could remember before he got the backend of the spear to the chest\r\n\r\nJarvan winced as the wind from his lungs were knocked out. The new trainee smirked, before lunging at him again. Jarvan managed to dodge it this time and launched a counterattack. The trainee saw this coming though, and deflected Jarvan&rsquo;s lance. Jarvan regained his stance and balanced. &ldquo;This guy is good&rdquo; Jarvan thought.\r\n\r\nWith newfound excitement, Jarvan charged and swing his lance aiming for the trainee&rsquo;s shin.  The attack was blocked without ease, followed by Jarvan taking two strikes, one to the thigh and one to the ribs. The strikes of the spears would damage any human had enough force and with some new teachings, they could pierce a dragon&#039;s heart.\r\n\r\n&ldquo;He strikes like lightning&hellip; WAIT A MINUTE.&rdquo; It just dawned on Jarvan who this mysterious trainee was. He knew of him but never really spoke to him nor did he ever work with him. The only thing he remembers is that he is skilled as he was his father&rsquo;s bodyguard. \r\n\r\n&ldquo;Nice to see you again Xin Zhao&rdquo; Jarvan spoke as he lowered his lance. Xin Zhao smirked and dropped his spear.\r\n\r\n&ldquo;You know you could of asked. We didn&#039;t need to do this trial. You know i would put you in straight away.&rdquo; Jarvan said. \r\n\r\nXin Zhao smirked. &ldquo;But where&#039;s the fun it that, it&#039;s not often you get to challenge the son of the king of Demacia&rdquo;\r\n\r\nJarvan and Xin Zhao laughed. Its not often that they got to relax during stressful times. With the fight against dragons being at its peak, it felt good to have a nice hearty laugh. \r\n\r\n&ldquo;Jarvan you have to see this&rdquo; Braum yelled, waving him over. Jarvan excused himself and told XIn to get himself used to the camp. Jarvan jogged over to Braum.\r\n\r\n&ldquo;See i told you, you can teach them to fight&rdquo; Braum said smugly, which was different for the Heart of the freljord. Jarvan watched in awe. All the practices payed off. Most of the trainees were constantly striking at good points that were hurt a dragon rather than glance off it and more so annoy it rather than damage it. Jarvan watched as Braum was right. The trainees can fight. The flurry of strikes hit the points they marked. The speed was faster than any time before. And of all, they striked with purpose. The training dummies splintered from the strikes with Pantheon nodding in approval of all the trainees hitting hard. For once in weeks, Jarvan felt that the Dragonslayers could defend against the oncoming dragon threat. And for once, he felt that the odds were in their favour.","replies":[]}
