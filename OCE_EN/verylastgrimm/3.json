I have too much spare time (aka not doing homework and doing this instead) and have decided to make league champions for fun. So i thought i would post the one i think its the best out of them all. Haven&#039;t gotten any backstory but that will hopefully happen in the future. But anyway here he is. \n\n\n\nRole:Mage\n\nPassive: Puppet master- Ven leads with one of his puppets, he gains buff depending of which puppet he leads with.\n\nIf he leads with Tril, every 10 seconds, he gets an empowered auto, Dealing magic damage and reduces armour and magic resist by For 1.5 seconds.\n\nIf he leads with O&rsquo;Quist, He deals 10% more damage to enemies who is health is higher than his current health.\n\nCasting an abilities except for q and ult changes the puppet leading.\n\nQ:Mind Tricks / Puppet Shock \n\nMind Tricks- If Tril is leading, Ven Chucks trilo in a straight line, If Tril hits an enemy unit it Tril deals  (% AP) magic damage. Tril then explodes, dealing (%HP) to enemies around Tril also slowing them.\n\nIf he kills an enemy unit, He can cast Puppet shock without having O&rsquo;Quist in the lead or paying its mana cost\n\nPuppet Shock - If O&rsquo;Quist is leading, Ven drains the life around (AP over 3 seconds) and putting it in Quist for 4 seconds. If he reactivates or the duration is over, Quist explodes, Dealing (% of life leached) and heals for % Of life leached\n\nIf he kills an enemy unit, He can cast Mind Tricks without having Trilo in the lead or paying its mana cost.\n\n\nW: Strings- Ven Sends Tril after an enemy champion, Stunning them, and slowing enemies around the target champion. all enemies also lose % of armor and magic resist for 2 seconds.\n\nAfter Strings has been casted,Ven now leads with tril\n\n\nE- Dummy Dance -  Ven dashes a short distance, O&lsquo;Quist in hand. Once at his target location, He jumps and drops Quist underneath him Dealing (%AP) magic damage,\n\nAfter Dummy Dance has been cast, Ven now leads with O&rsquo;Quist\n\nR-ShowStopper\nPassive: Ven gains bonus movement speed when enemies around him have been targeted by cc\n\nActive: Ven swings both of his puppets in a cone in front of him, dragging all enemy Champions hit by either of them to the center. Once the puppets clash, They explode dealing (%AP) and knocking all non champion enemy units back.\n\nThis is long i know but its an interesting idea i had. Thought i post and see what everyone else would say","replies":[{"poster":"vannetapear","date":"2016-09-07T04:13:57.169+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hello!

Im not the best at ratios because I have a tendency to make either too op or too under powered as i have shown. But feel free to add Ratios and stuff like that. Its not like i was going to do it anyway haha","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"EzeBlood","date":"2016-09-04T06:44:23.494+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I like the idea of the passive on the ult, but the wording seems wrong. Perhaps instead, have it say \"Passive: Ven gains bonus movement speed when enemies around him are movement impaired, displaced, silenced, or blinded. (These four cover all types of cc, including stasis and grounded, and riot doesn't like putting \"cc\" in their tooltips.)\nOtherwise, I think this is a mechanically well balanced champion. I'm assuming that Mage means suited to mid-lane rather than support/jg, in which case the sustain from O'Quist's Q and the maneuverability given by the E and R passive would cause some fairly strong early games that can snowball out of control, providing Ven's scalings were high enough.\nAll in all, good concept, I like it and I don't even play mid (Except the occasional Star Dragon).","replies":[{"poster":"VeryLastGrimm","date":"2016-09-06T06:46:21.594+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=EzeBlood,realm=OCE,application-id=hIjvqaz6,discussion-id=T1G42vyy,comment-id=0000,timestamp=2016-09-04T06:44:23.494+0000)\n>\n> I like the idea of the passive on the ult, but the wording seems wrong. \n\nI agree, the wording was wrong  but i found it easier to do that and not add ap Scaling as im afraid of making them too big or too small but my worst worry was that noone would understand how his passive and Q work. But thanks for the feedback and ill keep that in my notes","replies":[]}]}]}
