After 10 games, me and my brother finished our games with the same win ratios (6w 4L) and he finished silver 2 and i finished Bronze 1, This doesnt make sense as he finished silver 3 last season and I finished silver 2. Someone please explain as i thought you couldnt get a rank above the one you finished in last season. Cheers to anyone who will help.","replies":[{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2019-01-29T04:01:02.900+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Likely he played in preseason and saw a significant enough increase in his MMR throughout that time. It's also likely that he was versing higher MMR players (as a result or otherwise) during his placements, leading to higher LP gains for victories and so a higher starting point.\n\nIt isn't impossible to be placed higher than your end of season rank, just very uncommon.","replies":[]}]}
