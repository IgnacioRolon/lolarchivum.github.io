When I say \"positive attitude\" I just mean, don't mess with me and we'll get along just fine. Thought I might as well be upright and honest about that. But in terms of attitude I strive to win and I'm not toxic, nor am I boosted or the sort.\n\nMy IGN is the same as on here: Lovesick\n\nFurthermore, my top ADCs are: Twitch, Vayne, Ashe, Lucian and Ezreal.\nI do play every other ADC, and the only reason Jhin isn't up there is due to the fact I refuse to play busted picks, in an effort to properly learn the game and not abuse tactics, but I do play him. The only ADC I refuse to touch is Corki (not my style of champion), and potentially Draven (other ADCs do his job better+he's too situational).\n\nThe order (from best to worst) of my other ADCs goes as follows: Jhin, Tristana, Jinx, Caitlyn, Miss Fortune, Kog'maw, Sivir (awkward asf auto attack animation for me) and Varus.\nNotice, I left out Kalista, that's because she is currently not strong in the meta and until she is I will continue to leave her out. Though I will say my Kalista is actually rather good.","replies":[{"poster":"Mazoh","date":"2016-12-05T08:22:29.754+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"you seem abit retarded","replies":[{"poster":"catch this work","date":"2016-12-06T14:02:59.341+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"How so?
