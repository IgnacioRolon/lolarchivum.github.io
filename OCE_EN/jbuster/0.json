(B3, B2). \r\nI&#039;ve been in bronze 5 and i&#039;ve seen the horrible plays and decision making but bronze 5 players look like Gold players compared to level 30s. I&#039;m saying this because it sucks to be matched up with a level 30 because it usually means i&#039;m about to lose 20LP in my silver game. I&#039;m also bringing it up because they&#039;re about to make getting to level 30 around 2x (?) easier with the experience being alot less needed. \r\nI often play with my bronze 5 friend or my level 20ish friend and, not saying im good after all im only silver but, you know they&#039;re bad if you have 4-5 levels on them and you&#039;re 1v3ing in their base.\r\nEven a warning would be fine or a win requirement of like 300+ wins\r\n&quot;You&#039;re about to enter ranked mode, this is a competitive mode, opponents are more difficult&quot;\r\n\r\nBut that&#039;s my rant after losing 2 games with level 30s because they somehow died over 5 times before 15 minutes in a ranked game    {{item:3070}} {{item:3070}}","replies":[]}
