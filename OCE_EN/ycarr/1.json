Only way to climb is to assume that your allies will all feed to oblivion and bot will have a minimum of 10 deaths by 10 min. And do everything yourself. I mean there are games where one person does literally 97%+ of teams damage and their team isnt even fucked to honour for the legit solo carries, they feel they are all the shits even at 1/17 and scoff at the very idea they are useless trash. Thats how it goes, either 1v5, home their team has more idiots on it or lose.\n\nJust a side note, like 80% of game matchups in this meta are determined by which botlane gets ahead.","replies":[]}]}
