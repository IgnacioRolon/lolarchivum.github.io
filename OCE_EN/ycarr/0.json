You aren't their boss, and while there is the expectation that you are playing to win in ranked, that doesn't mean players are magically not going to have bad games. \n\nYou're saying you've never had a really bad game? You've never racked up 10 deaths far too quickly because the enemy is just that much better than you, or you're just that tilted? Would you want your team typing asshole bs at you for that when I'm sure you know you're doing bad or would you prefer they themselves actually play to win instead of just giving up because you lost lane?\n\nIt's really not that hard to just not be an ass.","replies":[{"poster":"TheDemonEmperor","date":"2018-03-08T14:08:53.728+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"There are bad games, and there are serval others factors. Which is more common to find, such as: \n\nBoosted\ntroll pick\ni dont care if win or lose\nYou did'nt do what i told you, so now ill run it down mid\nrefusing to communicate with team 'side lane farm all day'.\nbuild like a nub and when got told to adjust. Start raging and then dont want to win.\n\nI can go on and on. When you meet with these people ingame, they dont care. They think you're the fool to care about the win, they just want to have their 'FUN'. \n\nThe actual bad games from players are rarer than you think. assuming they are not being smurft on by their lane oppent. And lets not pretend all is well. Those people that is styling on the poor guy would taunt others aswell. Example. You suck, gg ez, bots game, ect. These remarks + the feeling of the oncoming defeat. What do you think is going to happen? people gonna hold hand? No, insults and finger pointing. Everything contribute to the event when someone would snap - some much quicker than others.  \n\nWhen the match is already down the hill, hey, what can you do. Might aswell give them a piece of your mind 'within boundary ofcourse'. \n\nIf you think company/manager dont straight up rage at the lower tier then think again 'your subordinate failure reflect greatly on you, so when shit hit the fan your job is also on the line'. Big corporate in asia are know to go hard on employee for not making deadline or standard. Another example is gordon ramsey; Take a  look at how he run his michelin star restaurant back in the day.\n\nYes this is a game, its not payed.
