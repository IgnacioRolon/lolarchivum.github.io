His ult synergises so well with tp as a lot of the time I can push my lane, back, ult bot lane, back again, and then tp top without losing much cs, doing this helps your bot lane so so much. Split pushing which in lower elos wins games is so easy as tf is the best split pusher in the game and often when theres a teamfight at baron I can just go full trick2g style and take down a inhib and even an additionall nexus tower a lot of the time as the enemy team has no idea how fast a tf can push lanes. an elixir of iron plus blu card lich bane prock = 1/4 of turrets health, you are literally the fastest tower pusher and wave clearer in the game, its crazy. I find a lot of people literally cant deal with how fast there top lane gets pushed and a lot of the time put way to much focus in too me allowing my team to take free objectives as the entire enemy team is usally sat in top lane chasing my a**.\r\n\r\nanyway just seeing posting this to ask what other people think of tf being a very viable top laner?","replies":[{"poster":"SorakaXHealBoT","date":"2015-06-21T16:22:39.639+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Well there is a reason why TF is played as a midlane champion because his ult have better coverage of the map because he can ult top or bot and therefore have maximum map pressure at mid lane","replies":[{"poster":"Alamo","date":"2015-06-21T23:15:07.884+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=SorakaXHealBoT,realm=OCE,application-id=FjGAIbRv,discussion-id=oFiLLtxc,comment-id=0000,timestamp=2015-06-21T16:22:39.639+0000)\n>\n> Well there is a reason why TF is played as a midlane champion because his ult have better coverage of the map because he can ult top or bot and therefore have maximum map pressure at mid lane\n\nGive this man a medal","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Garens Harem","date":"2015-06-22T08:59:52.281+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":">(new meta)\n\nclimb to diamond or somesh.it then\n\n> his laning phase in 90% of the matchups is great for farming\n\nthey can probs kill you , so you can't farm\n\n>considering that most meta top laners are meele based and tf is ranged with a stun and mana regen.\n\nhaving range, and a stun doens't make you immune to melees, eg j4\n\n> Split pushing which in lower elos wins games is so easy \n\n''lower elos'' key word\n\n>you are literally the fastest tower pusher\n\nye, and not tryndomere\nfast,but not the fastest.... and efficient \n\n\nThis can probably work well in low elo IMO.\nBut can work extremely well if you know what you're doing and your team coordinates a good split push.\n\nJust remember he is squishy.","replies":[{"poster":"Chicken4dinner","date":"2015-06-22T10:09:46.883+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The issue with top is that he has no mobility\n\nNo mobility = no gap closer\n\nno gap closer = no traversing the very long top lane fast\n\nno traversing top fast = you are vulnerable to any champ with more mobility then you and ganks are most likely lethal.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Alamo","date":"2015-06-22T06:40:49.765+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> You can't keep the lane warded constantly with only a trinket ward so you're very vulnerable before the first back.

There aren't actually many champs who have this and for most of them it usually means burning an ultimate. But TF DOES have one that lasts for TWO seconds and is on a ridiculously short cooldown. As part of a pick comp I think he'd be a great top laner, but for any other kind of team comp, there are other much better picks.","replies":[]},{"poster":"McRuthless","date":"2015-06-21T16:25:57.133+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The main reason why tf (and a lot of other ranged tops) aren't actually as good as they seem is because they are extremely easy to gank when played top because the lane is so long. Oftentimes you will be unable to escape ganks even with flash up against good junglers. The long lane also makes it easier for melees to all-in immobile champs so if you start to fall behind youre likely to get zoned or start feeding.\n\nTLDR it might be good 1v1 but it relies on the enemy jungler not taking advantage of you","replies":[{"poster":"Armpitpleasures","date":"2015-06-21T23:06:22.865+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thats what wards are for.
