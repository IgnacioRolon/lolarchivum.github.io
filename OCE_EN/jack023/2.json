Fully closing the game and restarting did not help.","url":"https://youtu.be/H8GKUdhWwcE","image":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/H8GKUdhWwcE/hqdefault.jpg"},"up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Just copying my bug report from the Reddit megathread. Any help would be greatly appreciated. I can&#039;t play like this.\n\n- **Server:**  OCE\n\n- **Type of Bug:** Can&#039;t open shop in ARAM.\n\n- **Description:** I cannot open the shop. I have checked my keybinds (It was as expected). I have clicked the shop button on the UI and I have clicked the shopkeeper. All three ways of opening the shop just expanded my champ stats next to my portait in the new UI.\n\n- **Video / Screenshot:** [Video of my trying top open the shop window.](https://youtu.be/H8GKUdhWwcE) You can see me clicking the shop and stats opening.\n\n- **Steps to reproduce:** Attempt to open shop.\n\n- **Expected result:** Shop window opens.\n\n- **Observed result:** Get expanded stats.\n\n- **Reproduction rate:** 100% for this game. Wasn&#039;t happening earlier. Restarting game did not fix. Just opened a custom Summoner&#039;s Rift as Graves. Same problem. Looks like I can&#039;t play League...\n\n\n**Edit:** Restarted my computer, same probelm. Game is literally unplayable.","replies":[{"poster":"Zxkuqyb","date":"2015-12-13T01:03:09.192+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"After searching for the answer i might have found it on youtube:\n\n\"I fixed the problem finally. It only took me 3 hours to find a post on a forum. \nIt turns out if you change resolution from Eyefinity (3 monitors) back to 1 and you kept the store open on one of the other screens then it will stay on the screen even if you don't have it plunged in or even at the resolution. The fix to the problem is changing the resolution to get it back again.
