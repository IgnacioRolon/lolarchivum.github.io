PLEASE HELP.","subforum":"Help & Support (OCE)","embed":{"description":null,"url":"http://i.imgur.com/uJEEvR9.png","image":"http://imgur.com/uJEEvR9s.png"},"up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I made a post on the forums about this last patch that got no response even though I provided as much info as possible.\n\nI actually went out and bought a new (much better) router recently to try and fix the problem. It seemed to work for a short while but recently I have had black screens like what is seen above when trying to join a game. This problem is different in that before when I loaded into a game it would take a long time to respond before it came up with a connection error. Now it immediately tells me it can&#039;t connect.\n\nThis started late into last patch and the patch today didn&#039;t fix it. I have tried repairing my game many times and have reinstalled the game twice recently and I am still getting these bugs. Despite the fact that I am struggling with the loading screen for the entire time attempting to join the games, this has earned me 5 games of 20 minute leaver buster which is really unacceptable. making me wait almost 2 hours in \"time out\" because the game is bugged is a complete joke.\n\nAny help with fixing this would be really appreciated. I just want to play some league.\n\nAlso can I have leaverbuster removed? If you actually get back to me with a fix its kind of hard to test if it works when I need to wait so long for games. It isn't like I am going afk intentionally, that should be obvious looking at my game logs.\n\nNinja edit: link to previous post, might be helpful idk. http://boards.oce.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/help-support-oce/HaqEiRtp-constant-crashing-black-screen-on-load","replies":[{"poster":"Jack023","date":"2015-08-08T04:29:47.243+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Bump","replies":[]}]}
