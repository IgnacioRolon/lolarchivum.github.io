Never had a problem like this in the past but in the days since the patch this has happened several times. \n\n5.14 has literally been the most buggy patch I have ever played since season 3. Is there any way to have the punishment removed? I am not going afk in games. Not only did this cost me getting promoted to silver but now bugs like this are making me wait before games. \n\nI am seriously insulted that Riot think it is okay to make me sit in time out for 25 minutes like a child because **their** service is flawed.

I've re-installed 3 times now and each time I play a couple games, then get black screened. I have low-prio for 7 games now, as the most I can ever seem to reconnect for is 3 games then it just drops me and I can't reconnect. I've tried multiple forums to fix it, along with updating all drivers, but nothing helps. Please for the glory of Teemo fix this.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Jack023","date":"2015-08-01T09:32:10.561+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Bump - Nearly a week with no response.

Restarted the client now I can't log in. Seeing this. http://i.imgur.com/92LDedW.png\n\nAble to help me at all? I just reinstalled the other day because of the shop bug. This is costing me so many ranked games now. It's really annoying.\n\nEdit: Just want to add that I went through the help article linked in the screenshot. Everything was already set correctly and my internet is working perfectly fine in every other application. This is definitely a league bug and I am being punished for it.\n\n\nEdit 2: This is the message I get when the load screen disconnects. http://i.imgur.com/RNWAV19.png\n\nEdit 3: Just did a speedtest to show its not my internet http://i.imgur.com/0ub436f.png Also want to note that if I actually eventually get into a game I don't have any connection issues.\n\nEdit 4: Finally connected to my ranked game at the 30 minute mark..... we actually managed to pull out a win anyway but I got another 5 games leaverbuster... now with 10 minute wait. This is actually complete bs. Totally unacceptable.","replies":[]}]}
