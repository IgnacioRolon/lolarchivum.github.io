Anyone with a red buff. Thats about it. They dont really give auto attack slows in too many places simply because of red buff going to the adc and melee champions can buy a frozen mallet which means anyone can get a slow on their auto attacks.","replies":[{"poster":"Nightjar","date":"2018-08-25T00:39:32.026+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"i mean with a good support an adc doesn't especially need redbuff, and frozen mallet is a bit niche, so I feel it's better suited for bruisers and hypercarries who lack CC, since most tanks can itemize into Iceborn Gauntlet if they really need an extra slow, which they often don't.\n\nRed buff burn flat true damage and %max hp life regen also tends to favour splitpushers rather than adcs, because lategame if an adc gets picked, they are going to die very quickly, and whilst the slow is nice (though halved for non-melee similarly to frozen mallet), the frontline should be doing their job of holding a defensive line and making engages, and the support should be making sure the backline is peeled for, and the small red buff burn doesn't really factor in when an adc is a dps machine.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"GreasedLightning","date":"2018-08-24T11:59:51.958+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"the big guy here is nautilus, his passive is a snare on hit +physical damage. it has a per target cooldown but in teamfight or skirmish you can rotate your aa and lockdown multiple targets without using abilities","replies":[]},{"poster":"BarryButcher","date":"2018-08-24T01:20:26.804+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"technically Bard does if he has a Meep.\nNautilus' first Auto on a champion is a small root.\n\nCho'gath's auto slows when he activates his E but I guess if you include that than you also include Nami's E.","replies":[]}]}
