Was previously silver 1.\r\n\r\nI can play both adc and support at a high standard. My best adc&#039;s are hypercarries like jinx, cait and kog where positioning is key. My best supports include thresh, brand, morg and ali, pretty much kill lane bot.\r\n\r\nIf you have a team and are looking for one more person for bot lane, please feel free to add me. :)","replies":[{"poster":"AlphaCueSlowly","date":"2016-04-16T04:53:55.611+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Sent you a request.","replies":[]}]}
