Nothing too serious.\n\nI&#039;m 19yo, currently at uni in Perth and will finish on the 30th Nov, so after that I should be free most of the time to play for the team. My role preferences from favourite to least favourite are support, adc, jg, top, mid. In silver 5 right now but I don&#039;t play a lot of ranked. My norms elo is somewhere around gold 3 if that means anything. I do have skype for communicating etc.\n\nHmu if you&#039;re interested in making a team/looking for another member.\n\nCheers,\n\nGeoff","replies":[{"poster":"ThePinkApe","date":"2016-02-08T11:40:13.308+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"looking for a group to climb out of b5 with open to any role except adc","replies":[]},{"poster":"Aidan7787","date":"2015-11-09T04:01:02.059+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Aidan7787 About to finish uni, \nMid:{{champion:103}} {{champion:1}} {{champion:7}} {{champion:45}} \nTop: {{champion:39}} {{champion:266}} \nJg: {{champion:203}} learning{{champion:421}} \nAdc: {{champion:22}} {{champion:18}}\nSup: {{champion:1}}","replies":[]},{"poster":"RebirthKnight","date":"2015-11-08T15:40:58.650+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'm also at uni, finishing soon.
