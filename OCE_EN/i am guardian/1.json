In game he or she continuously started to feed all 3 lanes, although I won my lane we lost the game. I Do not know if it is right to call his name out so i&#039;ll just keep it back for now.\nI would appreciate some sort of punishment to these types of players all over league of legends because it is really annoying and frustrating to other players that play league for fun.\n\n{{item:3070}}","replies":[{"poster":"Gesteppie","date":"2017-01-21T20:40:39.556+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"bump.","replies":[]},{"poster":"the killer duck","date":"2017-01-23T09:57:31.208+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"If only oce was like china where they're allowed to ban feeders. From what it is it seems this is from norms. in cases like this happen from champ select, just dodge. From people who rarely dodge it takes around five minutes till you get back on queue, plus you wont see the feeder because he's probably in game while you're waiting for that 5 minute queue. great way to stop those things from happening is to play five man remade. it allows easier communication and less feeders depending if the guys you're with are good or not. hope this helps :D","replies":[{"poster":"the killer duck","date":"2017-01-23T10:00:28.556+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Checked his op.gg, found the  Alistair's name. his name's _Name Removed_.
