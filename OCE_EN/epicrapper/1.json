This helped me get in but then the ping was so high, I couldn&#039;t even connect to chat.As soon as i revealed my ip,showing I&#039;m from India again,the game disconnected me from pvp.net .I have played for 4 months without this problem.It showed up just last week and I&#039;ve been trying everythin I can ever since.

It's most likely a server side issue.\n\nYou might also want to try port forwarding, which is actually far more complicated then what the article glosses over. If you want to try that, just ask. You'll need to tell me the brand of your router and what OS you are on.","replies":[{"poster":"EpicRapper","date":"2015-05-10T07:38:42.161+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Did everything you said lol.Also,I did everything on the page.My computer was factory reset just a month before  I got the game (in december).

If you haven't, it could be quite hard. Most people don't even know that their router has a setting page, let alone the password to access it.\n\nDo you use any VPN or proxy? If you do, disable that. Also, try uninstalling any anti-virus or firewall you may have installed (not just close, *completely uninstall*). Make sure to always run in admin mode until you find a solution.","replies":[{"poster":"EpicRapper","date":"2015-05-11T13:50:42.964+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Well...I'll try reinstalling my anti virus (I'll run the game after uninstalling and then reinstall it).I uninstalled my vpn service because it is too laggy (I can connect to oceanic using a vpn ). Also,I haven't tampered with my router ever since i reset it last year,other than the fact that I did what was mentioned on the league of legends help page. Also,the game lets me connect to oceanic some times,but after some time,it disconnects me again.Kind of weird.(I even got a 20min leaverbuster because of this issue....my north american account still works like a charm though)","replies":[{"poster":"HORSE OF FORCE","date":"2015-05-12T06:54:10.139+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Very weird. This probably goes beyond what I or any other player here can do to help. It's most likely a server side issue, or ISP specific. You can try calling up your ISP and see if they can help you out with it, though I doubt that anything less than contacting Riot and getting them to fix it will net you any results.\n\nOh yeah, it's against the EULA to use a VPN to connect to League. Just saying.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"EpicRapper","date":"2015-05-09T06:52:10.497+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"BUMP","replies":[]},{"poster":"EpicRapper","date":"2015-05-09T01:53:54.878+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"bump..","replies":[]},{"poster":"iBeeprofen","date":"2015-05-08T11:45:18.764+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"When you make a League of Legends account it is tied to the server you create it on i.e. North America.
