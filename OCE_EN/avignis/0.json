There's no mage option for QSS at the moment and a LOT of midlaners have hard CC\n2. The movement speed passive acts somewhat as a mage option for phage (Theres the mirrors of other items: {{item:3074}} {{item:3085}} , {{item:3100}} {{item:3078}} , {{item:3022}} {{item:3116}} , {{item:3172}} {{item:3115}} AND SO ON)\n3. The % damage reduction (possibly even a shield) is a nice little addition because 100% of champions that hit you with hard CC will use damage abilities aferwards ({{champion:103}} {{champion:1}} {{champion:63}} {{champion:127}} {{champion:45}} {{champion:143}} {{champion:101}} AND SO ON)\n\nSo please, thoughts?\n\n- harrysurf","replies":[{"poster":"Jacko","date":"2015-01-30T10:36:29.361+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Althought i would love a 120ap qss item, i think riot would not make this due to the reason there is already a defensive 120ap item, zhonyas. If riot want to make a 120ap mr item, sure that would be ok but with qss might be a little over powered. I think riot will try and introduce a safe item that lets you have a safer approach as a first item so you can farm your lane and get into the mid game. not sure what riot thinks though","replies":[]},{"poster":"Avignis","date":"2015-01-30T10:47:47.390+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Ok so I've gathered people don't like the QSS aspect but what about the move speed?","replies":[]},{"poster":"Slim Chaedi","date":"2015-01-30T10:44:08.844+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"People keep talking about a QSS item for AP, but I think if we get one we would need to remove Hourglass.

Having yet another ap survivability may be overkill considering ad doesn't have one either.
