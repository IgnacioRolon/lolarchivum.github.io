Its broken, you've basically just made a {{item:3152}}  but 100x better . Could you imagine this on an Ahri or Leblanc who already have strong mobility and can now lane forever with huge burst while being even harder to gank? While its good that you're being creative, at least try to balance an item first (who cares if it costs so much when every ap mage will buy it). Not every item in the game needs an AD/AP counterpart, because AP mids play very differently to (most) adc's.","replies":[{"poster":"Avignis","date":"2015-01-31T02:16:41.833+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"What if the recipe was aether wisp instead of revolver and stats were\n120 ap\n5% move speed and the passives kept. Maybe a 1-4% mana regen? It's really not all that much considering it works at 2-8 on adcs and ad champions. \nI see where you're coming from though.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Slim Chaedi","date":"2015-01-30T11:20:39.354+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Changes are necessary but I like the idea. It would be good for those APs who need some mana regen, but not much. Like, I feel this would be good on champions like Diana, who have some mana issues but not enough to warrant buying an item specifically for that.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Mar3thyu","date":"2015-01-30T11:14:17.055+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"maybe not life steal but it sounds awesome and yeah they could've removed dfgs passive but left the item its self as you now get 20 less ap if you build rylais","replies":[]},{"poster":"Chalze","date":"2015-01-31T08:31:44.711+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"AMAZING ON {{champion:8}}","replies":[]},{"poster":"Slim Chaedi","date":"2015-01-30T12:59:15.669+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I agree with Matutinus here, which is why I said changes are necessary. To be honest, I think this could be better if it didn't provide 120 AP. With the stats you suggest, mages who don't need the mana regen part will still get it too. Katarina and Vladimir would be all over this item, I think.","replies":[]}]}
