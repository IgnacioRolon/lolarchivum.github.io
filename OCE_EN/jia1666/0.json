I was against Wukong in the top lane, everytime he goes for the e q auto combo, i tried to parry it but i find out is that it doesn&#039;t block it. Thus, every time he ult me i parry it so he got stunned, i parried the first hit. The next hit from Wukong&#039;s Q i got knocked up again which means that his ult really has no counter play. Unless i was Shaco, can anyone help me? My team is calling me feeders, and i&#039;m really tilted about this thing, because it means that i can never get better at Fiora.","replies":[{"poster":"You Tried","date":"2016-11-20T23:45:10.004+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Although you parried his ult, his ult will still continue, so the other instance of damage will still knock you up, since it hasn't knocked you up yet.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Yasei Doubutsu","date":"2016-11-20T21:00:18.260+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"It should block it, your probably timing it wrong, you got like half a second to block dmg n stuff.\nThe rest of the animation is doing dmg.","replies":[]}]}
