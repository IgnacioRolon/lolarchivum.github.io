I was against Wukong in the top lane, everytime he goes for the e q auto combo, i tried to parry it but i find out is that it doesn&#039;t block it. Thus, every time he ult me i parry it so he got stunned, i parried the first hit. The next hit from Wukong&#039;s Q i got knocked up again which means that his ult really has no counter play. Unless i was Shaco, can anyone help me? My team is calling me feeders, and i&#039;m really tilted about this thing, because it means that i can never get better at Fiora.","replies":[]}
