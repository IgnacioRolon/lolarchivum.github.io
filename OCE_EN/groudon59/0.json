WHERE IS BALANCE!","subforum":"Gameplay & Strategy","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"Hello Riot, or other League of legends users. I have mained Assassins for since season 3, and obviously i have seen Assassins rise and fall, such as the season 3 terrifying broken {{champion:238}} and {{champion:121}} obviously when i saw the pbe changes to {{champion:38}} i was a absolutely upset as he is not even the op, like look at {{champion:76}} or even {{champion:55}} ok i main them and honestly there too strong, and u look at {{champion:38}} like its a joke, another thing i feel as if {{champion:121}} could use some buffs to make him viable and turn into the jump in the face killing bug once again, pls buff his healing to monsters and make his isolation range smaller, maybe by half just to give him opportunities in teamfights, like u can sit in a teamfight and never jump on the adc, cause the isolation range is just too big, RIot u want him, not to max w, and since maxing q is now the only option {{champion:121}} is probably one of the weakest assassins on the rift. pls have a look at his isolation range, or buff something in his kit, to help him have at least opportunities in teamfights, where not talking {{champion:238}} who can go in a teamfight and get out, he doesnt need isolation but {{champion:121}} does so pls look at this. Riot u dont need to change numbers on {{champion:121}} but at least help him where he needs it most which is isolation range, make people think about positioning rather than going im far away from support, but {{champion:121}} cant get me cause im still not isolated. like please look at some way to buff {{champion:121}} put him in a good spot once again, where maybe he may see a little competitive play like his comrade {{champion:238}} .","replies":[{"poster":"BarryButcher","date":"2015-02-24T05:35:28.125+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Give Kha'zix more healing when damaging monsters would be interesting. Don't touch the Q though.\n\nWe'll see how the kass nerf works out. Reduced the range, but the mana cost is way less. Maybe if they tweak the CD on it a bit it would be ok.","replies":[{"poster":"Groudon59","date":"2015-02-24T05:56:41.256+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hmm sounds like a good idea, but khas isolation range could be tweaked a bit in my opinion\njust to give him more opportunity","replies":[{"poster":"BarryButcher","date":"2015-02-24T06:27:31.689+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Riot are just trying to make it so that there isn't 1 or 2 champions that pro players play. Obviously will never happen sicne pros always pick \"safe\" and \"reliable\" champions and will always find 1 or 2 to pick.\n\nHence the uncalled for J4 nerfs imo.
