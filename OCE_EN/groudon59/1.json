I have mained Assassins for since season 3, and obviously i have seen Assassins rise and fall,  such as the season 3 terrifying broken {{champion:238}} and {{champion:121}}  obviously when i saw the pbe changes to {{champion:38}}  i was a absolutely upset as he is not even the op, like look at {{champion:76}}  or even {{champion:55}}  ok i main them and honestly there too strong, and u look at {{champion:38}}  like its a joke, another thing i feel as if {{champion:121}}  could use some adjustments to make him viable and turn into the jump in the face killing bug once again, pls buff his healing to monsters and make his isolation range smaller, maybe by half just to give him opportunities in teamfights, like u can sit in a teamfight and never jump on the adc, cause the isolation range is just too big, RIot u want him, not to max w, and since maxing q is now the only option {{champion:121}}  is probably one of the weakest assassins on the rift. pls have a look at his isolation range, or adjust something in his kit, to help him have at least opportunities in teamfights, where not talking {{champion:238}}  who can go in a teamfight and get out, he doesnt need isolation but {{champion:121}}  does so pls look at this. Riot u dont need to change numbers on {{champion:121}}  but at least help him where he needs it most which is isolation range, make people think about positioning rather than going im far away from support, but {{champion:121}}  cant get me cause im still not isolated. like please look at some way to buff {{champion:121}}  put him in a good spot once again, where maybe he may see a little competitive play like his comrade {{champion:238}} .","replies":[{"poster":"Sackboy","date":"2015-02-24T14:59:15.166+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"Kha'Tits does not need %%%%ing buffs, he's damage is idiotic already. He has a 600 damage on a 2s cooldown, resetting mobility, stealth, self-healing + a slow.\nAssuming you jungle him you should do well as his laning is absolute trash. Zed needs to be gutted ASAP, they nerfed all viable AP assassins then removed DFG and left %%%%ing Zed, lmfao. Zed is one of few that has low risk, high reward, where you need an item or he will kill you and has minimal counters and insane damage early on due to passive.","replies":[{"poster":"Groudon59","date":"2015-02-24T23:23:15.060+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Honestly, compare zed to other assassins, have u seen nidalee and katarina as Assassins, there the worst, nid with her dmb dmg and untop of that she has a heal as an assassin like WTH, and then the good ol kat, no counterplay just 100-0s u, there is no item on an adc which will save ur life, cause banshees doesnt stop her ult, like wth, at least zed becomes somewhat useless late game, but kat and nid just stay viable the whole game.","replies":[{"poster":"Sackboy","date":"2015-02-25T02:14:17.972+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Groudon59,realm=OCE,application-id=Ntey9fRZ,discussion-id=kEa5iFAU,comment-id=00010000,timestamp=2015-02-24T23:23:15.060+0000)\n>\n> Honestly, compare zed to other assassins, have u seen nidalee and katarina as Assassins, there the worst, nid with her dmb dmg and untop of that she has a heal as an assassin like WTH, and then the good ol kat, no counterplay just 100-0s u, there is no item on an adc which will save ur life, cause banshees doesnt stop her ult, like wth, at least zed becomes somewhat useless late game, but kat and nid just stay viable the whole game.\n\nKat's counterplay is chain CC, save your %%%%ing stun when she ults and Kat will die.
