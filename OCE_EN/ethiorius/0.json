I waited 40 minute queue for an ascension game to get a screen where I couldn't click any champions and had to wait another 15 minutes just to get back into queue :/ \n\nWell now game play is  a lot better than afternoon I do have to admit.

Lot of issues going on at the moment with the client disconnecting, lobbies misbehaving and queues not starting correctly. It's not because you played Ascension, but it's likely because Ascension has been implemented. I recommend coming back to it tomorrow, hopefully things will be running smoother then.","replies":[]}]}
