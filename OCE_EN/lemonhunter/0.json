If so where was it and what were the things you liked/disliked about it? If you have never attended a community run event, how come? Also, what are things you would love to see at a community run event?\r\n\r\nThis is just a great place to say what you want and also for those who are wanting to run some events to get an idea of what people want to see.","replies":[{"poster":"ShuffledPancake","date":"2015-05-20T05:40:13.199+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Never been to one, mainly bcz none are in goullburn, id like to see some tournaments,after partys etc","replies":[{"poster":"Maraudaur","date":"2015-05-20T07:32:11.789+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey man! \n\nIf there are no tournaments/events in your area why not host one?\n\nCheck out our new events portal: http://events.oce.leagueoflegends.com/\n\nI'm here to help as well if this is something you're interested in.","replies":[{"poster":"LemonHunter","date":"2015-05-20T07:44:15.046+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Beat me to the suggestion!\n\nGoulburn is about an hours drive from Canberra, yeah? I know there are quite a few League players from that area that I'm sure would come to an event if you host one! Plus players from all around that area. Riot are awesome at helping out if you want to run an event of some sort. I highly recommend it!\n\nit can be anything, a tournament at a local internet cafe, a viewing party for some OPL stuff at a hall/bar, even just a catch up to chat League stuff.
