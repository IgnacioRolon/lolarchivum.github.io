Armor pen is necessary. Get as much AD as you can really because you get defense out of it (her shield scales out of AD).\n\nHydra lets you wave push so if you don't need to go for Bloodthirster.\n\nBoxbox (pro riven player) basically just rushes Hydra even before boots whenever he can because it provides a nice mix of stats then builds Last Whisper and usually goes for CDR boots but goes mercs or tabi depending on matchups etc.\n\nTP flash is pretty good if you're just starting as its good for hard matchups but ignite is great and I personally like Azubu Frosts strategy of taking heal and ignite.","replies":[{"poster":"kJs","date":"2015-07-08T02:15:10.179+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"{{summoner:7}} {{summoner:14}} Well Riven does have 4 dashes...\nI take Heal and Ignite on {{champion:266}} I do well if the enemy takes teleport and flash, if they take ignite then I have a bit of a harder time.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"kJs","date":"2015-07-08T02:14:59.424+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You should search up \"how to animation cancel riven\" on google.\nIt's a skill that all Riven players have to learn.
