I was 7/2.... smiling happy ready for a new season. Thought I was actually getting somewhere, some great games! My final placement match. We dominated them, 8/2 was there. The team surrendered for the ultimate troll. 7/3. Season 2 to Season 6 of being a wood/silver player.\r\nThe End. I don&#039;t honestly think I can bring myself to come back into this community or play league again.\r\n\r\nP.S.

Don't waste other peoples time in a game like league of legends because you cant or won't take it seriously.\n\nProbably why your MMR is 592. it is you sir who should not play ranked.\n\nPS: I had a sneaky suspicion you were trash, as this response is commonly used by shitters to excuse their horrid performances at games like LoL, Lo and Behold a quick look into your stats, no surprises.","replies":[{"poster":"Doc Savage","date":"2016-01-29T18:52:09.913+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"this person does not play professionally lmao. again a braindead comparison. he plays solo queue ranked. that's like me playing a social comp for basketball. its main purpose is for enjoyment and exercise. of course you want to win, and nobody said you shouldn't be competitive, but if i HATED it for whatever reason why would i keep playing?\n\nif ranked solo queue is so toxic that this person has nothing but negative feelings towards it then he should just stop playing it, at least for a bit. maybe even the whole game altogether. why are you people getting so mad and salty about this concept.\n\nPS. people can have more than 1 account. its easy to troll people with a low mmr account who think they're good at a game lmao\n\nPPS its toxic people like you that is making this guy hate playing it","replies":[{"poster":"CatchTheseHands","date":"2016-02-01T23:30:36.892+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Wrong, OPL and LCS is equivalent to Professional rugby, Solo Q ranked is equivalent to Club Competitive rugby, Normals is your social team.
