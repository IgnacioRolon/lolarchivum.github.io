It is this rating that determines the people you are matched with and your LP gains and losses. You cannot drop from silver to bronze unless your mmr falls to that of a bronze 5 player i believe (Which is so that people don't lose their season rewards too easily). Many silver 5 players are essentially bronze level players that are still in silver because the system is such that they cannot actually fall to bronze. This is likely the situation you are in which is why you are matched with mainly bronze players. You also need to raise your mmr back to silver 5ish level before you will start seeing any meaningful LP gains.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Infected Walnut","date":"2015-08-27T03:07:19.713+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"it means your mmr is trash.","replies":[]}]}
