Granted I&#039;m not the best player but I just got wrecked in a ranked game by full AP jungle Cho&#039;Gath. He had ridiculous amounts of health and was doing 1200 damage with a single Rupture. Not to mention literally one-hitting everyone with Feast. And he was unkillable! Seemed a little unbalanced to me.\r\n\r\nJust my thoughts! {{champion:31}}","replies":[{"poster":"ABlueQuaker","date":"2015-04-20T15:37:07.524+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It just sounds like you got stomped by something you didn't understand/know how to play against.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Essembie","date":"2015-04-20T06:15:34.554+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Any champ built and played well is strong.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Lord Kylar Alice","date":"2015-04-20T00:35:57.070+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Build MR and his Q won't hit 1200.","replies":[]},{"poster":"WEETBIX 4 BREKKI","date":"2015-04-19T14:09:41.539+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"He's never really been strong or weak, he's one of the few balanced champs, if you build him ap, yes he has big spike damage, but he usually drops pretty fast, if you build him pure tank, he does ok aoe damage with support cc and serves as a good damage soak, but either way he's only 'ok' I wouldn't say he's an op champ.","replies":[]}]}
