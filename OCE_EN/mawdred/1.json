In the meantime, I'll add you and we can chat or play normals with other members of the team until he's back again. I'm not sure when that will be, but hopefully we will get this thing started. We've been planning on making a team for a very long time and it's disappointing that now we've finally taken the initiative something like this had to happen. :(","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Osama bin Ladin","date":"2015-03-28T00:56:31.552+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Summoner Name: Osama bin Ladin\nAge: 16\nGender: Male\nRank: S4\nPreferred Role [and/or Champions]: Top [like half the champs that go top] Mid [diana,oriana]\nReason for joining: Have been playing the game for 4 years but have never seriously gotten into ranked, think its about time I did\nAbit about yourself: Im a casual Russian teenager who lives in Sydney.
