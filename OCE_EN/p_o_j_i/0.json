Why is that we cant unlock the mastery even when i already own the champion ( 2nd option).\r\n\r\nIs it a bug or something??..really wanna know{{sticker:zombie-brand-mindblown}}","replies":[{"poster":"SephirothSG","date":"2016-05-29T05:40:37.011+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey there,\n\nChampion Permanents are obtainable through the reroll option in the hextech crafting menu afaik, you need to reroll 3 champ shards to obtain a champion permanent.","replies":[]}]}
