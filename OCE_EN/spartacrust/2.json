Well I&#039;d like to understand how it works, the only reason why I am concerned is that-  as a Bronze (Separate from Normals I know but still...) I shouldn&#039;t be versing Platinum to Challenger consistently, not just once every 10 or 20 so games, it is more or less I see them every 1-3 games...\r\n\r\n(I have won many of these higher-tier games and enjoyed them and have also hated them) But that doesn&#039;t mean that we should be placed there; not when the higher-tiers aren&#039;t sportsman like at all; they instantly bag out on the Bronze players, they won&#039;t even give out a few pointers where me/others have gone wrong.. It&#039;s just not a healthy environment to have fun I just want to know the reasoning behind this.\r\n\r\n(And I also think that partys have a big play in this)","replies":[{"poster":"Gr1fter","date":"2016-06-27T08:35:04.885+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I've had a similar problem a while ago, though it was only one game.\n\n[link to post](http://boards.oce.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/miscellaneous/Ep0KQh79-mmr-at-its-best)","replies":[]},{"poster":"JasonWazza","date":"2016-06-27T04:07:22.443+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Looks like another rito MMR reset, love these things.\n\nTo my knowledge (obviously not knowing from riots side) Riot resets normal MMR from time to time, and this can cause effects similar to these, for example, your probably at the reset point for MMR, so whenever someone gets reset they are likely to be at your MMR (and because high elo players don't play norms all that often, they are most likely to be at this reset point)\n\nI've had the same sort of experience (though not to the challenger extent, though they may be playing norms cause of dynamic queue who knows) basically just lose your way out of the MMR.\n\nEDIT: hell my fresh 30 account knows these feels.\n\nhttp://oce.op.gg/summoner/userName=valorcarrys\n\nClick normals, and go through the games, this is a fresh 30 account, (legit the bot games are still in the history) first normal i played once i hit 30 had a plat and a gold in it, and it's regularly against Gold 3-Plat 1 players.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Gryffindor","date":"2016-06-27T00:57:22.397+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Are you playing solo or with friends?","replies":[]},{"poster":"Roguestoney","date":"2016-06-26T22:47:58.914+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Haven't seen a post like this before...","replies":[]},{"poster":"Spartacrust","date":"2016-06-26T22:41:57.146+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Alrighty here's an update where I literally JUST versed a full platinum to challenger game /AGAIN/ And all of them reported me for being trash.
