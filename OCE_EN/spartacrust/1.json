Sure, I'll get \"insta-killed\" by any of a couple dozen champs I've seen played in the mode but fact is I'm not there to get kills, I'm there for objectives because we all know objectives>kills (and it's undeniable since a relic gives you 3 points whereas a kill only gives you 1). Mainly, I just run around securing relics which is actually great on Quinn because of the move speed from \"Behind Enemy Lines\".\n\nMaybe instead of being a \"kill chaser\" you should realise there's more to the game than a \"good\" K/D/A.","replies":[]}]}
