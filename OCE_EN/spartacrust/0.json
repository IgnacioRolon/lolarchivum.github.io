Then look at your team list (this is VERY important) find one thing ANYTHING that looks non meta and call them a troll and a feeder (if they have only half the amounts of deaths as you, do not worry, it does not matter) and then get your friends to report them!\n\nDo this enough times and Riot suspend or punish them and you won't have to worry about getting better YOURSELF or anything!
