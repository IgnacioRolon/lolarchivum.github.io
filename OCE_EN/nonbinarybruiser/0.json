Recently they buffed Karma&#039;s E and she became a shield bot and Lulu fell out of the meta.  Riot&#039;s been nerfing Karma since and has also taken to further overloading Lulu&#039;s kit.  Lulu already has a beyond overloaded kit but they decided she needed an attack speed steroid because lolfuckit.  Futher they&#039;re now buffing her Whimsy heavily because they still want her to be better than Karma.  They never had this much issue with Karma being worse.  Lulu was the go-to obnoxiously safe scaling lane for the longest time - i really don't want to go back to that.","replies":[{"poster":"BananaSlayerAMO","date":"2016-08-10T05:13:18.523+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Although Lulu's early game can be ridiculously good (at least at my level), her offensive power falls off later on (especially as a support, which I believe makes her less viable than Karma as a support). By giving her W an offensive ability and buffing her ability scaling, it makes her more viable as a solo laner, possibly pushing her away from a support role and making her more relevant late game.","replies":[{"poster":"Nightjar","date":"2016-08-10T05:53:50.661+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"she is becoming almost viable as a solo toplaner with a tanky ap build and it's cancer for most melee toplaners without any cc, poke or gapclosers.","replies":[{"poster":"BananaSlayerAMO","date":"2016-08-10T07:24:59.386+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"'melee toplaners without any cc, poke or gapclosers'\n\nthere are none tho.","replies":[]},{"poster":"BananaSlayerAMO","date":"2016-08-10T07:24:28.209+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"And she isn't just 'almost viable' - she's strong, op even (aka what this thread is about)","replies":[]},{"poster":"Talon12","date":"2016-08-10T06:42:08.347+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Nightjar,realm=OCE,application-id=FjGAIbRv,discussion-id=9WjqPht4,comment-id=00030000,timestamp=2016-08-10T05:53:50.661+0000)\n>\n> she is becoming almost viable as a solo toplaner with a tanky ap build and it&#x27;s cancer for most melee toplaners without any cc, poke or gapclosers.\n\nur literally the only person in the world complaining about that atm.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"JasonWazza","date":"2016-08-10T05:29:53.081+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"For OP, the problem isn't the fact that one is better then the other, it's the fact that they are so much just a choice between which is better.\n\nThe changes we are seeing, makes the picking option more impactful (though riot did it wrong i agree, they are making a meaningful decision)\n\nThe difference between Karma and Lulu is there now, where before, it was basically which one has bigger numbers.\n\nIt also give Lulu a massive trade off for stopping enemies (i can polymorph the enemy, or speed up and give AS to my ADC, which actually matters here?)\n\nThey are giving more player choice which isn't a bad thing, though i do agree they went overboard.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Nightjar","date":"2016-08-10T01:42:54.757+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"After seeing alot more lulu bruiser top, I feel with a buff on her passive or further increase on her atk speed she's going to dominate toplane. Early levels she's a  huge lane bully for immobile melee tops. Her passive, atk speed buff and shield makes it hard to outtrade her. You  try to get cs glitter oh half your hp is gone guess I'm not getting cs anymore. You build tank and her movespeed buffs and debuffs let her get away. Her passive does a surprising amount of damage if you jump on her and you won't outtrade because she'll just whimsy you (this spell used to be somewhat a last resort to turn a fight around, not every trade), aa, glitterlance and boom you lost the trade. I feel they're not buffing lulu in the right way since lulu top is such cancer atm and they still plan on buffing her.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Maraudaur","date":"2016-08-10T00:39:11.749+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I think support Karma and Mid Karma are in a good spot to be honest not too strong nor too weak.\n\nLulu i feel is a bit weaker in general but she just got a buff! =D lowered CD on W and increased ATK speed given.
