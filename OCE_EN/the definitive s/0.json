Same cooldowns etc, just everyone has all of them. Even revive and clarity etc. This would be a fun alternative and let a few more stategys imerge. 5 smites. 5 exhausts etc\r\n\r\n2 -  Allow the champ select screen to have an all chat option. Obviously this has no game play value just a pyschalogical challenge of champ baiting or flat out abuse.\r\n\r\nThoughts.\r\n\r\nTDS","replies":[{"poster":"Sneed","date":"2015-04-01T03:48:54.680+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"All random all top.\n\n'Revolutionary' - Phreak","replies":[]}]}
