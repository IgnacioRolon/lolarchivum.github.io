With this recall it wouldn&#039;t have to take much work to make you could just use a large cloud of dust to cover lots of it being made like in old cartoons.\n\nThere could be some clever Emotes Lulu could say but I also have no ideas for this :(\n\nJust my ideas of what this skin could be like :D","replies":[{"poster":"Krispy Migraine","date":"2016-08-27T06:07:06.097+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I didn't know that skins had a impact on abilities...
