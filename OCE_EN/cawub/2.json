I didn&#039;t have many creative ideas for **Kled in Shining Armour** so I am just going to stick with **Kled in a Box** for this post.\r\n\r\n_**Kled**_\r\nKled would have a cardboard helmet or crown of some sort as well as cardboard armour.\r\n\r\nHis weapon when on riding Skaarl would be a wooden sword or cardboard sword. When not on Skaarl, Kled would have a gun made of cardboard that fires rolled up paper balls. (The sword would attach to the gun so that it doesn&#039;t randomly disappear for no reason.)\r\n \r\n_**Skaarl**_\r\nThis is where I got really creative Skaarl could have the appearance of a box car or maybe have him looking like a plane.\r\n\r\n_Plane Idea_ - Skaarl could have cardboard plane wings taped to his sides and they could flop as he runs around. (You could also put designs on the wings like red flames or pink sparkles or blue stripes.) The wings could have streamers flowing off the backs almost like a kite. \r\n\r\n_Box car idea_ - Skaarl could look like a box car. The car could be a convertible so that it looks like Kled isn&#039;t sticking through the roof or anything. Like the plane idea when Skaarl runs the hood of the car could be flopping as Skaarl runs. For design the car could take the appearance of a race car with racing stripes different colours etc. (Race Kled could be a whole different Skin idea with Kled wearing a racing helmet and holding a trophy but that&#039;s for a different post.)\r\n\r\nI haven&#039;t seen any abilities of Kled or Skaarl so i don&#039;t have any ideas for specific ability skinning but this is all that i have come up with so far.\r\n\r\n:) I hope everyone enjoys my idea of a Kled skin!!","replies":[]}
