If you were meant to be where you were, you'll get back there, if you were really meant to be a bit lower, you'll be a bit lower. If you're out of practice and no longer should be where you were, then you'll stay lower until you get back into it. It's a way to maintain a system that (as accurately as is possible) reflects the actual skill of a player rather than what their skill was 6 months or longer ago. The whole point of climbing a ranked system is to get better, you can't expect to go up in divs without getting better, and you can't expect to maintain a div without maintaining your skill.\n \n> Riot just needs to either Make a 1v1 queue where mmr actually will be accurate (minus smurfs but smurfs will quickly rise to their proper mmr in a 1v1 situation before they can actually do any real damage to the balance) or remove the mmr system from the 5v5 queue\n> \n> I am a huge supporter of the individual performance scoring idea because as youve probably heard before, mmr is an archaic system literally designed for 1v1 chess matches.\n\nMMR is adapted from the ELO system (the one made for chess) for team play. The whole point is that if team 1 mmr = team 2 mmr and all the players have an approximately equal individual mmr, then the chances of winning are 50-50 for both sides. The MMR system DOES apply to team games. The outliers are a result of smurfs and boosted accounts which are only problems in the extreme cases where smurfs will intentionally fall to bronze, or where a bronzie will pay to get put in diamond in one fashion or another. \n\nThe other factor is of course the ever unpredictable human nature, and it is not something that can be reflected in those numbers. Your MMR reflects your average skill level, it averages out your bad games and your good games and your meh games. So you will frequently see people whose mmr is higher than what their present skill is reflecting, and visa versa. This doesn't mean the system doesn't work, it just means you are expecting a qualifiable answer from a quantifiable statistic. It's like trying to ask a computer how someone is feeling today but it has to explained in numbers, it just doesn't work that way.\n\nAnd what would you propose as an alternative? A system where you can say, \"I'm having a bad day please match me against lower people\" Yeah that wouldn't be abused at all. It wouldn't work either, because it wouldn't be an accurate representation of your skill, hence the need to average things in the first place.\n\n> Im not saying with individual ranking that bronze 5 player would be plat, but he wouldnt bronze 5 and thats where the inaccuracies lie.\n\nExtreme cases like this are rare. Bronze 5 generally speaking consists of: \nPeople who drop there intentionally. \nPeople who played ranked the second they could and got placed where they belonged and got stuck there because they didn't take the time out in normals to adapt to higher level play and learn enough to climb out on their own.\nGot placed in higher Bronze, got mad and tilted so hard they ended up losing all their games and are now stuck for the same reason.\n\nThere are always exceptions, but if there is a plat level player in B5 they are either there to fuck with people, in which case report the shit out of them, or they aren't actually Plat level and are just having a really good game. The same is true on the flipside. If there a Bronze level player in Plat, it is either because they were boosted, or they're having a really bad game.","replies":[{"poster":"YellowBrickRoad","date":"2016-01-21T06:10:27.959+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"no im saying as an alternative remove the team factor so that its pure skill matchups.\n\nYou can say how teamwork is a skill all you want but lets face it 90% of bronze all think they are the main character of league of legends the anime and want to be the guy who goes 20/0\n\nAs a result no one knows how to use teamwork, no one can be trusted to actually think for themselves (most of my wins i had to scream at people and hand hold them till they started doing the right things) and everyone thinks they are better than they actually are because they got ganked 10 times and fed and ran around one shotting people (in a 1v1 you cant get ganks so you have to do all the work yourself)\n\nThe other option of individual scoring is basically how champ mastery works, you play your game, you get a score at the end of it based on your overall performance, and that score defines how severe your lp loss or gain is, this way if you just so happen to get the 4 most retarded players in the entire playerbase you dont lose 20lp from bad luck, you still lose lp, but you dont lose an entire games worth because you visibly played better than the entire team.\n\nIn the individual scoring system if you consistently play bad? you will tank in ranks faster than you do in the current system, if you consistently play good you will climb faster than you do in the current system, if you consistently play so-so you probably wont notice a difference.\n\nThe end result ofc would be that you would be even LESS likely to be paired against or with players that arent at your true skill level because there is an actually measurable level of skill now instead of just an arbitrary number attached to your win loss ratio.","replies":[{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2016-01-21T06:21:01.873+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"And that is why they are still in low Bronze, This is a team game, this always has been a team game. If you want a solo experience, do custom 1v1s or wait till Feb when solo q comes out and everyone is on equal ground. \"90% or BRONZE all think\" Precisely. Don't get me wrong, I don't hate on Bronze, and I agree that it can be one of the most toxic experiences in the game. But especially as far as B5 is concerned, they end up there for a reason, and if they don't work to change that reason, they're going to stay there.\n\nThe whole point of this game is that you work with or around your teammates to help everyone win. It's not just you winning or losing, it's four other people. If your team mmrs were equal, but the other team had better teamwork, then that's their only real advantage, and here's the kicker, not something that should be taken away from them. You're basically saying, that instead of those without the skill having to work to get better, those with it should be handicapped? That seems kind of strange for a team game doesn't it?\n\nChamp mastery essentially IS your individual scoring, and very soon you will get rewards for it. Doesn't change the fact that League is a team game, and if you don't participate in the team, your chances of winning drop dramatically.\n\nAnd as far as 1v1s are concerned, they're incredibly skewed. If you are a top or jungle main and have solid skill with champs like Udyr or Renekton then 1v1s are great. But what if you're a support Nami main like me? You think I'm gonna be coming out of any 1v1s with solid victory? No, because this game and it's champions were designed around teams. Why should I have to learn champions and a playstyle I don't enjoy to prove to people like you that I'm good at the game, when what I'm already good at proves that in a team scenario? Is my skill inferior because Nami is bad with 1v1s? What about all the times your support has saved your butt or gotten you triple kills with epic counterplay and reaction? Are they still worthless to you in those moments?","replies":[{"poster":"YellowBrickRoad","date":"2016-01-21T06:34:38.085+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thats the opposite of what im saying.\n\nWhat im saying is with an individual performance scoring system you would be less handicapped, im sure youve had your share of unwinnable games yes? ever had like 3-4 of those in a row because you got really unlucky, how pissed off were you that you lost 60lp as a result of something you cant control.\n\nHow much less tilted would you be if you played really well in those games but just couldnt carry that troll so you only lost say 20 lp all up? hmm? less tilted yeah? More willing to keep playing, and youd feel justified because you havnt lost ranking due to something you cant control.\n\nThe other scenario this would imply is that that team that had equal mmr but had better teamwork? wouldnt even exist, not because it would ruin teamwork, but rather because they have better teamwork they would a higher mmr, that doesnt happen right now because for every team you get that synergises well you get 2 more that just bitch and moan at each other and go off and do their own thing all game. because people who can use teamwork are also naturally more skilled which means they perform better which makes their individual scores better which makes them climb faster?\n\nBasically itd just turbo charge the current system and remove the mmr grind.\n\nNo one could complain that they dont belong where they are, because their scores are based on THEIR performance, not their teams.\n\ni cant believe you are arguing against what is clearly a superior system that just takes more effort on riots side programming wise.\n\nAnd as for the support triple kill statement, i wouldnt know my elo is so low that ive never experienced that, yes teamwork is THAT rare down here, and for good reason as i said teamwork means higher skill level, which should mean more lp gain.\n\nFor instance i am more than willing to help my team, and i strive to try to uphold the standards of teamwork at all times, but when my team wont cooperate and it feels like a 1v9 it makes climbing in lp very difficult, as i am of the third option you stated for b5, placed high (i was placed b1) and tilted my way to b5, i am neither skilled enough to just 1v9 my way up the ranks, nor am i capable of not hating my fellow players for holding me down.","replies":[{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2016-01-21T07:52:38.361+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Not really. I can't say I've ever had an 'unwinnable' game (barring dcs/afks/intent feeders and the like, all of which are punishable offences). At the very least I have played any that left any lasting impression. I've had games that were harder, I've had games that were easier, and I've had games where I got frustrated at my own mistakes and started playing worse and worse. Then I take a break, and come back to it when I'm not salty anymore instead of playing through what I know are going to be bad games for me. I've had maybe a couple games that were skewed so badly that the other team mwas just that much better than us and we couldn't hope to win.\n\nYou can't win 100% of games, that's just not how it works, and there will always be that one troll or that one inexperienced player every now and again. Doesn't mean they have to cost you the game. If they're just inexperienced then you can help them. If they're toxic just report and move on, there's not point doing more than that. \n\n> The other scenario this would imply is that that team that had equal mmr but had better teamwork? wouldnt even exist, not because it would ruin teamwork, but rather because they have better teamwork they would a higher mmr\n\nOnly if that team always plays together would their mmr be higher. The system has no basis for how these specific people will play together. The system cannot account for things like 'this person doesn't work well with people' 'this person doesn't know how to play with a Yasuo on the team' 'this person doesn't know how to ADC with a Soraka support' It doesn't have any valid stats for that kind of thing, hence the difference. If the enemy team pulls their shit together and works well as a team, following up on observed strengths and covering observed weaknesses then of course they are going to do better, that's where the solo factor comes in. As a solo player you have to be versatile, and know what to look for in teammates and how to support them by what little you get to see of them. If I see that my ADC is playing aggressively then I will do so also, and cover when they overextend. If I see my ADC is playing passive then I'm going to hang back and look for opportunities for hard engages.\n\n> you still lose lp, but you dont lose an entire games worth because you visibly played better than the entire team.\n\n> teamwork means higher skill level, which should mean more lp gain.\n\nFirst you say that your lp should be tied to your own performance more than that of the team, then you say it should be tied to teams performance because teamwork is good?? \n\nOr are you saying that if you did better than your team and lose, you lose less lp, but if the efforts of the team pull you through then you should get more? Because basically that's saying, if I lose I'm better than everyone else and should lose less, and if I win I'm still better than everyone else and should win more....\n\nThis game isn't as simple as how you yourself play. It's about how you yourself play with the rest of the team as well, and the system does it's best to account for that. I'm not saying it's a perfect system, I'm just saying I don't understand why people have a such a big problem with a system that doesn't really have any major flaws. Smurfs and boosted accounts aren't flaws in the system, they're outliers in the behaviour patterns that the system has difficulty accounting for for very valid reasons. \n\nIf you would like to go in and program something better I'd like to see you try. Because you say all this like 'oh but they could do this and it would be better' like it's EASY.

We've derailed the original post more than a little so I'll try to keep it short.\n\nI can't outright disagree with anything you've said. There are a few things I would think or see differently, but in concept it's not a bad idea. The issues would arise in the implementation, the actual response from the community and how the system would handle outliers. The system we have is by no means perfect, but it is adequate, and that is presumably why Riot has been so wary of messing with it. \n\nThe new champ select has gone a long way to reducing toxicity in ranked queues, and the general toxicity is also quite a large factor in making any decision regarding the ranked system. They also have to consider the pro scene, though they could very well put them on a different system if it worked out better and they had the time/resources to do so.\n\nMY opinion, is that the drama about how unfair the mmr system is more than a little overblown. There are cases where it screws up, and screws up bad certainly, but I genuinely don't think that for the average player it presents any real problems as far as where they should be and who they should be vsing. That's my take anyway. No system is perfect, I just think people hate on the one they have more than it deserves.","replies":[{"poster":"YellowBrickRoad","date":"2016-01-21T09:06:11.028+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Ill agree with you there, tbh i just think the system would make things a little easier on the low end and provide more competition in the challenger scene (challenger rank is based on lp, and if you rise in rank because you play like a god imagine the pressure to make plays up there, wed see some pretty dank shit)\n\nfrankly the fact that i can easily go 18/9 with draven top with a durry in one hand and watching a movie at my current elo should show im not meant to be at this tier, not saying im silver but im not b5 is the easiest way to put it.\n\nGranted i could always just go get anger management classes to stop myself tilting my way down the ladder, but i dont get angry at anything but league so thatd be a wasted effort for a few tiers at most.\n\nTbh i dont think the concept of mmr in and of itself is a bad thing, i just think we are using the wrong data to calculate it is all, win loss ratio is such a binary thing with so many variables of input that its almost impossible to get a stable mmr based on that alone.\n\nI guess what i want to replicate is the sporting world where individual players are judged based on their contributions to the team rather than the overall efforts of the team, which is why bad players get benched even when a team is winning and good players can be drafted for better teams even if their team is losing.\n\nKeeping in mind that while yes those players are judged by humans not a machine the way we judge them is purely numerical, number of tries/scores etc etc.\n\nSo for instance we could say add damage done to structures/structures destroyed, kills+assists/deaths, healing done, damage done, dragons killed, barons killed (these would both only count for the players in the pit when the objective dies) stuff like that, then give them all a weighting based on the roll you queued for (if you queued top structure damage might be more valuable than kills+assists, or vice versa for say a mid laner) Then the end results could be put into a formula that gives you a final score that affects your lp gain by a percentage, so say your total value is 50% so you lose 50% less lp or gain 50% more lp depending on if you win or lose, you could take it further still and keep the current mmr system but apply the 50% to the mmr instead so that mmr is still invisible.\n\nThats just all napkin psuedomath but its one possible way to go about doing it.","replies":[{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2016-01-21T09:19:01.230+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I feel perhaps a ranked practice mode would be a good investment.

Having a practice mode would give them a place to take things seriously, but to also learn and practice champions in a competitive environment without it impacting their actual rank. \n\nHaving something like this would also help new or inexperienced players. New players just starting in ranked could get an idea of where they might end up if they were to play actual ranked and will have experience with the wholly different beast that ranked is. Like the difference between regular and pro play, the attitudes, strategies and social rules are all very very different between ranked and norms. \n\nThis also (theoretically) helps with your problem, because it gives people a place to get better, without the pressure of a badge and a div number weighing them down.
