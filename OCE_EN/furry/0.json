Or is it just frustrating","subforum":"Gameplay & Strategy","up_votes":3,"down_votes":2,"body":"Hello everyone =) \r\n\r\nI&#039;m going to just say right now I enjoy playing this game. I enjoy most champions. I even like versing most things that are being called &quot;OP&quot; \r\n\r\nBut I find it exceedingly frustrating when there is literally zero that I can do vs some champions when they can 100-0 you with little to no effort on their part. Does anyone else get this? I&#039;m not talking about a 22-0 ryze or someone that&#039;s excessively fed and ahead. I&#039;m talking even trades and then BOOM you get destroyed seemingly out of nowhere. \r\n\r\nZed&#039;s R is a prime example. As soon as he hits 6, he presses R, gets a free kill. No skill at all involved for the most part in lower elo&#039;s like I&#039;m playing in.  Fizz is another example. If he lands an R.. pretty much any squishy target is about to get nuked. \r\n\r\nYou can say that &quot;they&#039;re assassins. It&#039;s what they do&quot; but is that really justifying it? They have these obscene amounts of damage, and every tool they need to escape. Free of charge. No flash needed. \r\n\r\nLux is a different story. Her ability to 100-0 targets is healthy. She has no escapes other than a shield. She  needs to land a thin line skillshot to start her combo. \r\n\r\nRengar.... well even Riot said in their red posts from surrender@20 that he is unhealthy for the game in his current state. \r\n\r\nBut Zed? Fizz? They have literally zero counterplay in most cases. A good fizz can dodge pretty much any skillshot he pleases, and many targeted shots like a taric stun, and what is worse is that his dodge has a very low cooldown, makes him fully untargetable so you lose target. Zed however... he has multiple options of escape available, and is almost ungankable thanks to the short cooldowns on his slow and shadow. \r\n\r\nI have seen multiple instances of zeds. playing from behind, press r, dive the ahead mid laner under the enemy turret, do their combo, and shadow out for a free kill. As soon as they hit 6. How is this fair? You work so hard to keep these champions in check, and they still snowball out of control off the back of stupid burst they get just because of base skill numbers, not even itemisation. \r\n\r\nPlease Riot. Fix your broken balancing. 99% of Your player base aren&#039;t LCS players. So stop balancing for the 1% who are and work at making the game fun for EVERYONE who plays it. And that means stop with the 100-0 champs with zero counterplay for the majority of your champion pool. Counterpicks happen, but they shouldn&#039;t mean a free easy win for whichever side picked the zed.","replies":[{"poster":"Talon12","date":"2016-01-18T06:16:21.035+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"its frustrating how riot decided tanks are most superior choice for everything, they can assassinate squishy people just as well as assassins, but they can't be assassinated as easily themselves, that's frustrating.

If he lands an R.. pretty much any squishy target is about to get nuked. \n\nZed's level 6 kills, unless the opponent is already very low usually requires a large amount of skill. You more often than not need to hit absolutely everything and make the absolute most of your deathmark without it being interrupted by anything to just have enough damage, and no mid laner is just gonna let you have the freedom to do that. And well, Fizz is a bit of an unhealthy champion, he's a little overloaded but there is skill involved in terms of landing the fish and timing your abilities well to dodge incoming damage. You also have to consider that in the teamfights, both of these champions are incredibly risky since they are squishy melee carries, \n\n\n> You can say that &quot;they&#039;re assassins.

Both of these champions have to put themself at risk and don't often get the ability to delete multiple champions. Lux can do it to two champions on her own without being anywhere near them...","replies":[{"poster":"Gesteppie","date":"2016-01-18T07:31:28.844+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Well Seeing how league is turning into an E-sport that's being purely balanced around those people who play it for competitive reasons, they'll never \"rebalance\" champs for the rest of us... whats OP for us is not necessarily op for the challenger/master people because they're masters of their champions and know how to play and counter play with them.\n\nThose of us who sit down the bottom end of the spectrum and don't understand each champ down to their detail can find that some champs are OP because we don't know how to counter play to them or use our own champs to their best of their abilities.\n\nLeague is moving away from a beginner to intermediate friendly game to a high pro league game and forgetting about the rest of us.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"NewTronix","date":"2016-01-18T11:15:43.314+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"EVER HEARD OF QSS?","replies":[{"poster":"FerrousOxide","date":"2016-01-21T18:03:04.836+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"There needs to be an AP Qss built to item.

Does QSS fix the problem when Fizz can dodge with low cooldowns?\n\nOn the same subject, Vladimir seems to be really tanky and can deal a lot of damage. He has life steal but his abilities somewhat make up for it. There's also Dr. Mundo though. He has massive health regeneration when he presses R and does way too much damage for someone who can soak up half an enemy teams' damage. There's classic examples of tanks stomping on the enemy without any damage items and I think that should be a massive concern for Riot.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"FerrousOxide","date":"2016-01-21T17:59:07.468+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Zed's R  if you fighting zed build armor, also as soon as he ults cc him or use mobility to make a gap, his ult does no damage if he cant follow it up with a combo. \n\nFiz, Fiz ult as a skill shot and can be avoided. The ability that fiz has the frustrates me is playful trickster.  But even you just have to bait it out before you all in him. \n\nOn {{champion:99}} . I think shes unhealthy, Her ult telegraph is way to long, anyone paying any attention can avoid it with ease compared to comparable damage and range ults like jinx or ez, jinx at range you get a spit second to dodge as it comes into veiw, Ez similar but is also rather wider than the other two. \n\nRengar is nothing if you use pink wards  or Red trinket right.\n\nI agree both Zed and Fiz are very hard to gank or counter play with their insane mobility, Leblank can be added to that this too i think.","replies":[]},{"poster":"JasonWazza","date":"2016-01-19T15:53:37.804+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I just want to go over a small thing.\n\n>Lux is a different story.

It isn't riots fault if you don't exploit a champions weaknesses and avoid champions strengths. Both Zed and Fizz have counter play, with Zed you can cc immediately after ult or not stand in his ult range  so he has to w to get to you before the ult and even if all of that fails or you cant do that you could just side step the Zed's q and his combo wont kill you early game. With fizz you pretty much have to dodge the shark and if you aren't confident in that stay back and farm from range without dying.","replies":[]},{"poster":"DarkDerma","date":"2016-01-18T06:56:32.332+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"With Rengar there was pretty much 0 counter play availble for most adcs but zed and fizz can be counter with a simple qss or a decent support","replies":[]},{"poster":"Lord Sesshomaru","date":"2016-01-18T08:14:38.691+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Pfff who needs a Zed or a Fizz?\n\njust play MF, point in the general direction and press R, free 4000 damage. (well i say free.. its actually 100 mana, but yea.. basically free)\n\nplus Lux's ability to 100-0 something is not healthy, no champion should have the ability to 100-0 something at a safe range in a single combo without prior setting up, sure it requires her to hit a skillshot, but so do lots of other combo's and they don't 100-0, take syndra for example, like lux she has only CC to protect her and no escapes, unlike Lux she doesn't just hover her cursor over the opponent and press all her buttons, she needs to carefully position all her abilities, and that takes time to do. With lux, as soon as that Q lands BAM! you just let loose all your other spells for a kill, and if it doesn't hit then you just don't press them and you wait a few seconds for Q to come back up. All other immobile mages like Ori/Zyra/Xerath even Malzahar require more positioning and thought and some setting up for their combos, not only does Lux only need to land one skillshot in order to get a kill from a safe distance, but it goes through a minion wave as well, so it requires even less careful positioning.","replies":[]}]}
