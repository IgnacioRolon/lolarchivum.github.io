I do believe I acted moderately poorly in this game, using various mental disability insults and racial slurs however I consider this to be filtered. I see these type of insults in every ranked game I play in silver elo, especially during the night period.

Muting does not solve the problem, it only hides it. You still have rot behind your shower, and you have still seen the rot behind your shower. You don't have to take it to heart or lament it to know it's wrong and that something should be done about it.\n\nYes, some people get up in arms about nothing, and some people don't care at all, and some of every perspective in between. Riot has to find a middle ground, and hiding racism and blatant verbal abuse behind a curtain isn't it.\n\nI get the feeling you've never experienced true depression, and you should consider yourself lucky. It's like a deep well with a glass lid on top and a spike trap at the bottom. You can climb higher and higher, but you'll never truly escape it. Your hold at the top might be surer than ever, but you can never climb out. On the bad days, you slip, you find it harder to hold on, and the further you slip down the less reason you have to, the more hopeless it seems because the sky is that much further away.\n\nIt isn't about being sensitive. It's about fighting a battle every second of every day. It's *exhausting*. Just as trying to hold on to the side of a well would be. At the bottom of that pit, there is no 'stupid reason'. Just more reasons to not bother climbing back out. It's normal not to understand that if you've never experienced it but to ridicule it?\n\nThose who make it their business to be offended about everything are not the same as the people that struggle with the simple act of living.

You still very much give me the impression that while you obviously haven't had an easy life, nor one anyone would wish on another, clinical depression is something foreign to you.\n\nSevere genetic depression isn't sadness, or strife, or caused by any event or circumstance. It's not something you can just get over. It's something you can somewhat control and manage but that never goes away. Kinda like coldsores. Always in your system, but you might never see them again, or might see them all the time.\n\nIt isn't always logical. Depression doesn't have to have a reason to make you feel like crap.\n\nWhat support told you about muting, is because retaliating makes everything worse. Muting is the advice offered to those who seemingly cannot or will not temper their responses appropriately. Offering mute as an option is to help prevent the problem from spreading. If you don't see it as a problem, then we will never see eye to eye.","replies":[]},{"poster":"TheDemonEmperor","date":"2018-05-02T04:38:58.376+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Congrat, you are not born with a weak wiring of nerulogical function in your brain.
