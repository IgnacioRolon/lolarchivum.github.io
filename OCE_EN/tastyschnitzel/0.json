How about give Trundle, Mundo, Shyvana or some speedy fighter tank a go then next time you verse a Jhin go ham on him. I'm certain if they're alone you will always beat him. \n{{champion:105}}  You're also forgetting Assassins. Their sole purpose is to kill people like Jhin and they're really good at it. I'm guessing you've been playing Bot lane a lot. Try some newer things against Jhin and you'll have a fun time finding new ways to get around him. \n\nGood luck with your games friend :)\n{{sticker:slayer-pantheon-thumbs}}","replies":[]},{"poster":"Tweak","date":"2016-05-05T01:23:39.799+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It's interesting seeing that \"<Champion Name> is op\" is still around. It used to be a more abundant title back in 2009 and 2010.\nAlthough because so many people just shut those people down in the day, they started to show up less.\nThe reason it find it really interesting is because the community is at a point where it will provide a reasonable answer to it.\n\nI personally believe that Jhin is balanced. He's countered by 'in your face assassins'. The time between his attacks and his reload makes him vulnerable during certain parts of a fight.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Talon12","date":"2016-04-19T10:54:04.306+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The only thing Jhin doesn't get smashed by (that he beats) are squishy low damage, low utility champs. Everything else eats him for breakfast. Unless he is super fed, he gets the short end of the stick compared to other champions.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Er√∏se","date":"2016-04-19T10:49:14.129+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"CC the shit out of jhin and you can win against him no doubt. Even though jhin might have tons of damage there is something that he doesn't and that is mobility, have you seen how slow jhin is? Use that to your advantage and use champions like zed, fizz , talon, ahri , leblanc, kassadin who have high mobility and high damage. You can also use champions like shyvana, jax, garen, olaf and volibear etc. Basically fast tank-fighters. Mobile champions can counter him very easily by dodging his abilities. For example as soon as someone like a jax, zed or a fizz gets close combat to him, that's it jhin is useless, he gets fked hard. Jhin is not unbeatable. I assume that you play against him botlane. Just make sure you play safe and don't go to agro unless your jungler is coming or you have a support who can pull jhin to you Thresh,Blitz or who can peel extremely well for you like Naut, Morgana, Janna, Alistar. \n\nLast tip is to just keep playing and playing, soon enough you would learn how to counter each individual champion in league of legends.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Requiemsfire","date":"2016-04-18T14:58:49.849+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Most marksmen out trade a Jhin in raw DPS and have more escapes as well as much more reliable CC. I'm not saying Jhin is weak, but its that people tend to exaggerate his strengths when they see him doing well and forget he has a lot of weaknesses. \n\nHe's a strong team fighter, who is able to deal high amounts of burst to execute enemies who has utility in his kit to control the battle but like any other champion he will deal outrageous amounts of damage if he gets fed enough. Even if he's fed, he is still immobile, he is still squishy and he lacks any real mobility. \n\nAnyone that can all in, Avoid Jhin's skill shots, and possess really strong poke can beat Jhin. \n","replies":[]}]}
