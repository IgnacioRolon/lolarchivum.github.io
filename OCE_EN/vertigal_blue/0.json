The last 2 games i played i flamed hard as shit, and i do believe i deserve some punishment for overstepping my boundary. However, literally the FIRST punishment i ever get from riot is a damn permaban, with only  2 games chat logs to support their decision. I find it EXTREMELY EXTREMELY unfair that this system and riot support perma banning players with NO warning, no prior punishment of sorts and not even a suspension. Honestly had i known i was this close to getting permabanned, OFCOURSE i wouldnt have behaved the way i did.

This the single worst chat log I've ever seen on the boards. If you had've said this chat log in a public space IRL, you'd probably have community service right now. \n\nI think Riot is justified issuing an instant perma-ban here.

It's quite popular among peeps who have nothing better to do, and is something Riot has been working hard trying to deal with, and I wouldn't be surprised if that's actually the reason why they give you perm right off the bat.\n\nBut then again, don't be a meanie sunshine.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Ingénue","date":"2016-12-21T14:45:31.168+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"IMO if you tell someone to kill themselves, I think the permaban without warning is deserved. \n\nAlso, I would like to point out that it doesn't matter what your teammates are doing/saying, you should use your brain and not stoop to their level.

It's a tricky situation to deal with whether reviews are done by the automated systems or by an actual Rioter. I've no doubt (personally) it's the worst category in regards to false positives but there's not much that can be done in that regard until Riot are able to find better detection methods for such kinds of disallowed software. As a general rule of thumb: if you're unsure just turn it off while you have LoL running.","replies":[{"poster":"Talon12","date":"2016-12-22T12:04:07.051+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I see now, rioter's go out of their way and perma ban people after 1 bad game, what an awesome strategy.","replies":[{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2016-12-22T13:09:46.073+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"If you're going to be racist/homophobic/threatening or just generally excel in the realms of shitty people then you're gonna get banned real fast.

Obviously we have slightly different perspectives on this, but usually when I see instant permas like this it's first punishment but 2-3 games.  In fact I'm pretty sure the only time I've seen an instant perma with one game of logs was in cases where the player had multiple permabanned accounts for extreme behaviour already.\n\nThat said, if there's a specific case you had in mind I'd be happy to discuss it, these kinds of punishments are something I definitely find interesting, both in terms of how the system sees them and in the behaviour that triggers them.","replies":[]},{"poster":"SEKAI","date":"2016-12-23T04:25:33.746+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Talon12,realm=OCE,application-id=T8eq2lFQ,discussion-id=Aznxd9Gn,comment-id=00060000000000000000,timestamp=2016-12-23T04:20:14.971+0000)\n>\n> Not saying its not bad, I&#x27;m just saying in the past 6 months there have been quite a few perma bans for just 1 bad game.\n\nBanned from 1 may be debatable depending on the situation, but OP had 2, where both of which he presented himself as the biggest ass in town. And thus he was banned.\n\nIs perma justified? Well think of it this way.\n\nThey just got lvl 30 and their first ever Ranked matches was him being like that, even if it wasn't a perma, it would surely still be long enough for OP to level another account anyway. Hence while the account may be perma banned, it's actually not that big of a loss on their part, and it serves as a punishment and message just alright by having them re-level again.\n\nIn this instance for the purpose of this thread, I think there is no issue.","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2016-12-22T13:08:22.681+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The system can issue 14 day and permanent bans, but for perma bans it is usually reviewed manually if not issued manually (to the best of my knowledge anyway).\n\nIt's also worth noting that the 3rd party scripting bans actually have the lowest rate of false positives, since there is very little wiggle room. If an illicit program has been detected, it's for a reason. I've only seen two false positives in my time as a lurker and later as a volunteer (that includes NA as well). \n\nOne of those wasn't even really a false positive, but was rather a case of someone using a bannable program, being warned for it (back when they had a problem with things like custom skin programs that had other bad stuff in them), creating a new account but not properly removing said program and getting banned again despite not using it.\n\nIn the majority of the Ï swear I didn't use them\" cases, it's because they've shared the account.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"4fy9bEOt7y","date":"2016-12-23T11:19:26.910+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"\"vertigal blue: kill yourself\"\n\nIs what got you banned.
