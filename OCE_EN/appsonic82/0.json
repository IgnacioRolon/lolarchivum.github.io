OR he ill simply switch like he does now but as he switches Red \"Hologram Squares (read his E for more details on Red Squares).\r\n\r\nHis Q Would throw the \"Athena Shield shurikens) out from his back with a light glow coming from the back of it (Like Arcade Hecarim has a rainbow glow behind him when he uses his E) The Glow would be a Light Red.\r\n\r\nHis E would send up red Holographic Squares (Like yasuo in a small way) and Be Light Red. \r\n\r\nStill Figuring out his Ultimate But it would have something to Do with the \"Holographic Disks) and the X would be Orange\r\n\r\nStill no name (cyber,Advanced,PROJECT,Holographic zed?)\r\n\r\nThis would be a 1350RP skin \r\n\r\nAny Reference to anyone else's skin ideas is Completely accidental :)\r\n\r\nthanks for reading and i would love Criticism but please Be Nice :)\r\n\r\n(I'm still working on ideas so i may change this) {{champion:238}} {{champion:238}} {{champion:238}}Dont Be Cold Hearted :P  {{item:3110}}","replies":[{"poster":"Juju fancIub","date":"2015-02-15T04:47:18.410+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Project zed sounds cool but the whole idea of holograms and light doesnt do him any favours.
