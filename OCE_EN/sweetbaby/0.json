Anytime you report someone, no one care because they never get punishment. I doubt that OCE RIOT stuff never review our reports from the system. I am so disappointed. For the LeaverBuster, it is even worse. e.g. In a match, one of my teammates troll the game on purpose and made others don't want to play the game. So I just stay in base wait for the end. However, I was put into the low priority queue due to this. This is just ridiculous.\r\n\r\nWhat do you guys think about this?","replies":[{"poster":"Organic Tuna","date":"2015-01-20T08:39:19.619+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"If Riot does not remove my pop up for the leavebuster, I will leave the game for good. It made me really upset because I have been a good gamer but I had some internet issues so I had some dcs. This is not my fault so I can't make a commitment that I won't do it again.","replies":[]},{"poster":"HORSE OF FORCE","date":"2015-01-21T07:01:03.148+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":">So I just stay in base wait for the end.\n\nOh no, someone's purposefully left the game to torment our team-mates and make an unbalanced game. You know what I'm gonna do about it? I'll afk too! That'll show 'em.","replies":[]}]}
