I heard the ASUS fans are btter than HP? I mainly use it for school though . My old HP Pavillion that was Core i5 and8BG RAM I used for school lasted 2 years of gaming before it had fan problems due to dust an it costed around 1.2K or 1.3K I think . Anyone have recommendations for laptops under around $1.6k if possible that I can use mainly for school and to play league?","replies":[{"poster":"Sallice","date":"2019-11-17T09:32:57.827+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"https://www.jbhifi.com.au/products/hp-pavilion-15-dk0212tx-full-hd-gaming-laptop\n\nThis one here would be a great all around for school and gameplay!","replies":[]},{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2019-11-16T03:55:00.739+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":">IntelÂ® UHD Graphics 620\n\nThis is probably going to be your biggest barrier. Look for a laptop that has discrete graphics (not build into the motherboard) and you're basically guaranteed in the range you want. Discrete graphics will also mostly solve your heat problems. Finding one that is also a 2-in-1 is going to be the tricky part since the features are designed (and therefore implemented for) very different uses.\n\nYou likely also don't have to spend anywhere close to $1600 depending on what features you want/need. League isn't a super-intensive game, and if you're happy not having everything else on super-duper ultra, then half that will generally be plenty.\n\nhttps://www.jbhifi.com.au/products/acer-aspire-5-a515-51g-15-6-hd-laptop\n\nThis one, for example, would run games just fine and League on full, but it's not a 2-in-1 (which you may want/require for school) and doesn't have an SSD (will load slower in general and is more at risk of damage if you drop it or move it around a lot while it's on).\n\nIt comes down to what features you are prioritising. There are a decent chunk of on-board graphics that will run League just fine, but if you're getting into more intensive territory like the Witcher, Call of Duty, etc. you will run into trouble fast.\n\nMy recommendations:\n\n[Best Price](https://www.jbhifi.com.au/products/acer-aspire-5-a515-51g-15-6-hd-laptop) (At the cost of 2-in-1 features)\n\n[Best 2-in-1 Price](https://www.jbhifi.com.au/products/lenovo-yoga-720-13-3-2-in-1-laptop-platinum) (At the cost of gaming)\n\n[Best of Both](https://www.jbhifi.com.au/products/acer-spin-5-sp515-51gn-87y0-15-6-2-in-1-laptop-i7) (At the cost of money)","replies":[]},{"poster":"ThanatosX","date":"2019-11-16T03:25:31.094+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You can \"play\" LoL on just about anything, judging by some scrubs load times.\n\nI got an Acer Nitro 5 to use as my media center / torrent box.
