Some fuckwit is going around logging into people's accounts and getting them banned.\r\n\r\nNoticed on Monday that my RP was lower that what I though I had left but brushed it off as me accidentally making a purchase. Fast forward to this morning, I logged in and it said I was in a game. Apparently someone hacked into my account and played two ranked games - no biggie.\r\n\r\nLogged in just now and said my account was banned for using a third party software. Wouldn't have really cared less but I've embarrassingly spent quite a bit on money in the last 6 years or so on this account so it would be a damn shame to lose it.","replies":[{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2019-09-08T12:47:02.965+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"In case you aren't aware, you can usually recover such an account (and have any actions like purchases taken under compromise reset) by  following through the account recovery process with support: https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/requests/new\n\nAs a side note, there are a few things that can make account recovery impossible or unlikely, like if you have a history of sharing your account.","replies":[]}]}
