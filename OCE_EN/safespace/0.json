The second game I had a Graves jungle that literally only PVE'd for the first 22 minutes of the game, even when he was literally 10-15 seconds away from lanes that the enemy Vi was ganking (in vision) while being pinged to help. I was punished for responding to behavior, that was in my opinion, far worse than anything \"toxic\" I said.\nHere's the logs; \n\nGame 1\nIn-Game\nSafeSpace: lol.\nSafeSpace: Wtf\nSafeSpace: fuck

them when I do all already\nSafeSpace: graves lost\nSafeSpace: because he deserved iot\n\nGame 1: \n\"SafeSpace: fuck off\nSafeSpace: just actually fuck off lmao\"  - all of their laners were constantly invading my jungle, it was just friendly /all banter, if I could post the full logs with all the chat with gameplay in context it was fine, not toxic at all.\n\n\"SafeSpace: your moron bot has no summs and comes in my jg??\nSafeSpace: what is your fucking issue\" - again, just banter. Their bot lane roamed into my jungle with their mid lane and didn't leave for over a minute.\n\n\"SafeSpace: ?\nSafeSpace: I got double flashed on....\nSafeSpace: and you're 0/3...\" - my mid laner said \"I don't know what's with all these fucking retarded players\" after I died, so I responded. Their mid and top chased me for ~30 seconds and double flashed on me\n\n\"SafeSpace: you have 41 cs bro\nSafeSpace: you're bronze\" - Our Tristana was flaming me super hard saying 'this is all on you, oyu are a shit jungle you fucking retard' etc. and saying he was a smurf and therefore had some sort of highground on me, so I responded by telling him he had 41 cs at 20 minutes and he is bronze. I mean, I don't know if he's bronze but, bot wasn't even getting pressured hard at all so 41 cs at 20 minutes is a little ludicrous to be flaming someone for being bad.\n \n\"SafeSpace: I hate toxic people that claim they smurf when they just suck\" - I was responding to Tristana saying \"I hate retarded players that can't play jungle\" \n\n------------\n\nGame 2:\n\n\n\n\"SafeSpace: graves\nSafeSpace: you are useless\" - In mid lane the enemy mid laner was pushing into our turret with low resources and no summoners, in bot lane the enemy junglerwas ganking us multiple times (in vision) and all three enemies were half hp or under overextending to try and all in us once more, graves was pinged multiple times to simply walk to one or the other, instead he did scuttle and dragon. The one assist he had in the game thus far, about 10 mins in, was from a laner coming to assist him in his jungle to stop their Vi counter jungling him.\n\nAfter this it just continued. On and on and on. He never looked to a lane to gank it, he just PvE'd literally the whole game, when his camps weren't up he'd counter jungle. When laners needed help he'd recall or just keep farming. He avoided giving anyone help and didn't listen to a single call. It was so bad it HAD to be intentionally griefing. So I started taking his camps and saying \"hehe me graves hehe\" because he clearly thought it was funny to see if he could only PvE all game and leave laners to 4v5. \n\n------------\n\n\nLook, I do come off as toxic here with only my logs to show. Something tells me that Riot doesn't actually look at the context of what is being said. I'm pretty sure they only pull up the chat logs of what you have said when you get reported and just read it without any context whatsoever. I was responding to two toxic and angry players in the first game flaming me for things literally out of my control. One of whom who said things much, much worse. Just objectively. In the second game I was frustrated by a player intentionally griefing. I don't think it's fair that an extremely toxic player can extract a reaction from me then report me and get rewarded for it. I don't think it's fair that calling someone intentionally griefing \"useless\" and saying things in chat about it (because you're pissed your game and all of your play in it is reduced to nothing because of them making it a 4v5) is punished more consistently and more easily than someone literally griefing.\n\nI just think considering what happened in these games this punishment was not needed at all. I am not needlessly toxic to people doing bad, I am not legitimately aggressive for no reason, but if someone flames me, calls me a shit retard, and they're doing awful, I'm going to tell them how they're doing. Probably not in a nice way. If the entire enemy team is sacrificing farm to camp my jungle, I'm going to banter in /all for fun, it's not like any of them are going to take it seriously, they're probably more happy to see it than not honestly. I don't think I'm wrong in saying it's pretty much Australian culture to swear in general, to have banter with people you're competing against, and it's also pretty Aussie to have a no bullshit attitude.  \n\nI am not asking for my punishment to be lifted, I am not asking for anyone to agree with me, but I really want this report system to change if it is the case that they only observe the reported person's logs. It's just lazy. If someone starts arcing someone up with extremely toxic behaviour and gets (a fairly tame) response from them then I believe the person responding to the extremely toxic behaviour should not be punished. For that to happen there needs to be a more cohesive \"toxic behaviour\" investigation system than simply pulling a reported person's logs and looking at them out of context. You should probably take another look at what defines \"toxic\" in the OCE region as well. Because people will say \"you fucking %%%%\" in not a bad way (like they get ganked etc.) then one or two people who don't like them will report them, and out of context it looks aggressive so they will be punished if it happens over 2 games out of 20. It's ridiculous since \"you fucking %%%%\" is literally how a mass percentage of Australians talk in their downtime. I feel like there is a massive disconnect between what actually degrades the quality of the game and what is mostly punished, it needs to change. I can't sit idly by while reporting people multiple times for legitimately inting/ griefing, them not being punished and then myself being chat restricted/ suspended/ banned for getting mad at it.\n","replies":[{"poster":"Bullet proof","date":"2019-12-08T19:58:24.633+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"you seem irritating to play with so maybe you need a chat restriction to pipe down dude, also I mained Lux mid to master tier so {{champion:31}}","replies":[{"poster":"SafeSpace","date":"2019-12-09T03:13:35.963+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"OPGG says you reached Diamond 3 with a 50% winrate over 1,580 games in Season 9.\n\nI think you're mostly upset because I picked on your champion in the thread. I have no problem with Lux, she is fine. Just off meta and not great. Just like off meta siege jungles are fine, just not great. The Lux in this game said the jungle I picked wasn't great, so I informed them that they're also playing a mid lane that's not great. Lux is the 47th best pick out of 53 in mid lane. From my experience she is very easy to deal with early and a good player will force her to mess up her wave and then punish her slow skillshots with the space.\n\nAlso, if you read the whole thread I'm not asking whether it was deserved in your opinion or not, I am more talking about the system on a whole. \n\n> I feel like there is a massive disconnect between what actually degrades the quality of the game and what is mostly punished, it needs to change.

Do you really think being more chat focused than gameplay focused when it comes to punishing players is the right thing? Also, this was a Normal game. In ranked I don't even talk anymore. I /mute all and use the chat for timers.","replies":[{"poster":"Rallick","date":"2019-12-11T23:35:32.696+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Nowhere near your level of gameplay, and while reading the log i can see why you got chat restricted, but i have to say there does seem a vast scope in what riot punishes. \nI had a guy swear at me constantly, then threaten to kill my family, because he was jhin and i was veigar and kept e stunning him....in an aram. Reported him, nothing happened, quoted the rules of what constitutes a bannable/suspendable offense per riot documents to the person i requested to review, was told i could not be informed of his punishment for confidentiality, said we can all see on op.gg that he is still playing therefore regardless of penalty leveled it was not in line with their stated goals and methods.....and i was told there was nothing further to be done in the ticket and it would be closed. Now i can't even request a review by a person, has to be by blitz bot.\nSo no, i don't think your penalty was incorrect, but yes i do think riot is particularly poor at following a consistent reward/punishment system.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Bullet proof","date":"2019-12-09T15:49:22.022+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"My peak was masters, but I demoted because of school but i went from d4 to masters in a 2 week period when i was tryharding but thanks for the context.

Even if your team are \"bad\". Looking at those chat logs was very cringing. Nobody likes to be told they \"Suck\" or \"bad\" you calling people trash is going to tilt others and yourself.\n\nIf you honestly believe, that you should not have been punished based on those chat logs, then you honestly need to re-read those chat logs. Their is a lot of carrying on and toxic behaviour. The system doesn't need to be modified. It did the right thing by giving you that 25 game restriction.\n\nAnd by what you have already stated about the out of context Swearing etc, Online gaming AND real life swearing is seen as toxic/nasty. \n\nI'll give you an example below\n\"\nSafeSpace: lol.\nSafeSpace: Wtf - Can be seen as a question (Won't be flagged)\nSafeSpace: fuck off - More along the lines of being toxic towards the other player. (Flagged)\nSafeSpace: just actually fuck off lmao  - Reinforcing what you said in previous msg (Flagged)\nSafeSpace: your moron bot has no summs and comes in my jg?? - Now your personalising and directing this at a specific person/player. (Flagged)\nSafeSpace: what is your fucking issue - telling that player they have an issue but using a swear. (Flagged)\n \"\n\nSafeSpace: this game is over lol - Now you gave up. (Which is against the rules) (Flagged)\n\nNow with that above would have triggered the System along with the player report. That's not including what else was said in game 1 and 2.\n\n\n\"SafeSpace: fuck off\nSafeSpace: just actually fuck off lmao\" - all of their laners were constantly invading my jungle, it was just friendly /all banter, if I could post the full logs with all the chat with gameplay in context it was fine, not toxic at all.\n\nLet me explain this ^^ \n\nI get to you its out of context yes, however you were reported for the entirety of the Match/chat logs. Regardless you can banter without the profanity.\n\n\"SafeSpace: you have 41 cs bro\nSafeSpace: you're bronze\" - Our Tristana was flaming me super hard saying 'this is all on you, oyu are a shit jungle you fucking retard' etc. and saying he was a smurf and therefore had some sort of highground on me, so I responded by telling him he had 41 cs at 20 minutes and he is bronze. I mean, I don't know if he's bronze but, bot wasn't even getting pressured hard at all so 41 cs at 20 minutes is a little ludicrous to be flaming someone for being bad.\n\n^^Not everyone is great at cs, heck i'm terrible at getting the optimal cs per 10 minutes of gameplay. I'm much improved now due to heaps of practice. But i'm still needing to learn more!\n\n\nIn short you deserved the restriction\n\n\nHere are some super helpful tips to make sure this is not followed up by a two week suspension and ultimately a Perm-ban.\n\n1. Mute every player. (Don't mute pings unless their spamming them)\n\n2. The only words you ever need to type in chat is \"GJ\" \"TY\" and \"GGWP\" any other is unnecessary and distracts you from gameplay.\n\n3.  Play \"YOUR\" game. Don't worry about others. Trust me if you worry only about yourself you'll see yourself improve your own gameplay and others.\n\n\nHope this helped :)\n\nOrgastae","replies":[]}]}
