Completely forgot until I tried to log in today after a mate of mine asked me if i wanted to play.\r\n\r\nI went over a read my log and honestly.. besides the use of one word (Fa&amp;&amp;ot) which I never use these days due to maturing, but can see why it would trigger a TWO DAY MUTE, I can&#039;t see why I was permed? I didn&#039;t get any temporary mutes and/or bans, just straight into a perm ban. The only punishment I received prior to this was a 10 match chat restriction a WHOLE YEAR prior to the perm, so over 3 years ago.\r\n\r\nI went to email their support team but apparently did when I first copped the perm banned and by re-reading the emails it looks as if they have no clue on what they&#039;re talking about, telling me my perm mute without prior punishments is deserved for something I did literally over a year prior to my perm?

In more recent times, such language has been labelled zero tolerance, meaning any offence of such a nature will result in an instant 14 day suspension (skipping chat restrictions), or a perma if a 14 day ban has already been issued.\n---\nWhile the system has changed somewhat in the last 2 years, you will not, and to the best extent of my knowledge would not have received an instant permanent suspension for any behaviour related offence except cheating (scripting, 3rd party abuse etc). You will always receive a 14 day suspension first.\n\nA perma ban will only ever be removed or reduced if it is issued or escalated in error, a valid permanent suspension is just that, permanent.\n\nEven in cases of proved reform, permanently suspended accounts are not returned. Such systems were attempted, and had an almost universal relapse rate. Reform rates at permanent suspension are so low that such a system is just not scale-able, as it would have to be highly personalised. Even if you can prove reform, if the account was not suspended in error, it will not be returned.\n---\nWithout your full logs, noone can tell you if the punishment was warranted or not. \n\nWithout your full punishment and report history (which only support can see), noone can tell you for certain if the permanent suspension was appropriate.\n\nYou cannot bypass support, though you can reattempt your appeal. Tier 1 support is often customised macro responses, if your first response does not offer the context you desire, just reply to the ticket stating as much. Keeping your tickets short and to the point is beneficial as well.","replies":[{"poster":"Whatshisnamee","date":"2018-11-06T21:30:40.871+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"does a bot look through logs and go through the trigger word logs because 85% of players i report dont even get punished","replies":[{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2018-11-07T02:32:53.981+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Most reports are reviewed by the automated system, but it isn't triggered by keywords. It's a machine learning system capable of much more in depth analysis that simply \"were any of this list of words said yes or no?\". \n\nWhen it comes to zero tolerance language it can often seem that way, since homophobic or racist slurs, \"kys\", crap like that results in instant punishment, and when quoted does *appear* to have a higher false positive rate (not in any way confirmed) which further enforces the feel of 'keyword bans'. You need only look at non-escalated punishments to see the system can catch some pretty nuanced negativity.\n\nManual reviews are also run constantly to ensure the automated system stays on track and learns where it needs to, and appeals are all investigated.\n\nRegarding most players you report not being punished, there is a wide variety of reasons this could be the case, or you could be perceiving it to be, including but not limited to:\n\n* The popup you get informing you that a player has been punished is notoriously limited, and not very reliable, so just because you didn't receive the popup, doesn't by any stretch mean no action was taken.\n* Not all punishments are bans. While match history can often clue us in to time bans if not confirm them, there is absolutely no way to know if a player has been chat restricted (this is perfectly intentional).\n* First offences are rarely punished. Only the most severe behaviours are punished for first offences, and even then, the system has to be confident in the offence (this mostly applies to gameplay related offences like intent feeding). This hardly doesn't mean your report is worthless, it can and usually will contribute to punishment as a mark of negative history if the behaviour continues.\n* The middle ground. Riot can hardly please everyone, they can't completely stifle competitiveness and banter because why would they, but they also can't let people get away with too much. Something you believe should be punished, I can almost guarantee someone else feels should be allowed (for example the \"hate speech should be instant perma regardless of context\" vs \"no chat should ever result in any punishment\" argument).","replies":[{"poster":"Whatshisnamee","date":"2018-11-07T05:02:05.048+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"i said \"is saying kys bannable\" and i got a 2 week banned. i had no previous history of punishments btw","replies":[{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2018-11-07T05:29:16.758+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"If that is really all you said then it's likely it was a false pickup, and a ticket to support should get that resolved.\n\nhttps://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/requests/new","replies":[{"poster":"Whatshisnamee","date":"2018-11-07T10:41:47.852+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"its ok that was at the start of the year thank u","replies":[]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"i touched her","date":"2018-11-05T11:20:48.046+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yeah I get the whole \"It might not hurt you but it hurts them\" sort of thing which is what I meant by maturing, I just keep my mouth shut now as opposed to retaliating. I received no prior punishment to my perm ban and even asked both the support staff who handled my ticket how it was justified to which they replied \"you had a 10 game chat restriction a year ago\", not those words exactly, it was more formal. \n\nProblem is I don't know if my ban was manual or automated. I know for a fact that in 3 games in a row i was reported by the same 2 people who were tolling in all 3 games for telling them to \"F up and F off\" and calling one the word I've already posted. Even when asked about this they wouldn't reply. So I don't know if it was automated due to constant reports or manually implemented.\n\nI don't want my account unbanned because I \"reformed\".

It does not matter if you were reported by 1 person or 9, only if the report is valid or not.\n\nAs for your support responses, you still have access to those and I'd be very curious to see them. Either there is more to the story or there was some sort of miscommunication between you and the agent. I've been doing this for a long while and to the very best off my knowledge, even 2 years ago you couldn't be escalated from a 10 game chat restrict to a permanent suspension, I don't believe that has been possible since the introduction of the new system.\n\nIf the ban wasn't for cheating or a charge-back, then the only way you would skip that 14 day would be if your account was manually reviewed and your behaviour deemed consistently and severely negative while dodging the automated to warrant skipping that punishment, which would only be done in incredibly extenuating circumstances. The automated system cannot physically skip the 14 day ban tier. It can skip to it, but not over it.\n\nAgain, we can't tell you much without your chat logs, your behaviour history (not just your punishment history, and only support can provide this) and your support tickets. Without that information you've been told all we can give you. \n\nThere is of course the chance, albeit a minuscule one (0.01% of *penalties*) that your punishment was the result of a false positive, but if it was it should have been resolved the first time through support.\n\nThe best suggestion I can give you is to reattempt your appeal. Keep it short and sweet, explain that you don't feel the *severity* of the punishment was warranted, and go from there.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Whatshisnamee","date":"2018-11-06T21:29:54.046+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"i think u should be greatful u didnt get a 2 week ban like i was given on my first strike","replies":[]},{"poster":"phantom9399","date":"2018-11-08T10:48:16.598+0000","up_votes":0,"down_votes":1,"body":"[quote]PHANTOM9399\nNovember 8th 2018, 6:36:31 pm\nOnce again, your reporting system is a joke, 6+ months of troll picks, throwing easy wins, trolling in general, baiting my team mates into flaming, yet still no punishment?
