I had quickly opened up a support ticket in hopes that the matter could be resolved quickly. I reviewed my match history to see if I had been compromised and found nothing suspicious.  \n\nRiot support did what Riot support usually do in this situation and tell me nothing can be done. Reviewing the forums also quickly diminished my optimism that this will be resolved soon. But I had faith that this has all been one big mistake and something must of tripped their systems. \nI was never rude to the support team at most somewhat sassy when they started repeating themselves. \n\nMoving on, the little information I could squeeze out that is that I had apparently been scripting &#039;multiple times&#039; and that I may have even been reported for scripting which apparently led them to the conclusion that I was. \nI skimmed over my match history all the way back to the start of 2016 and found nothing obvious that I had been compromised. Riot also confirmed that I had not been.  \nI have been accused of scripting once years ago in an Aram but otherwise I don&#039;t exactly play that well to put myself in a position to be accused as one. Possibly I had a good game and someone did report me I cant say for sure. \nI do know that all games at least in the last year or so was done from the same PC which is shared by no one and is password protected. I also trust my roommates and am confident no one jumped on and did any funny business. \n\nI tried to identify the source of the trigger. \n\nThey dismissed Overwolf, Razer Synapse and Discord. I even confirmed that it was not due to a little Macro I had on my keyboard that just send a message in chat, something I had for months and did not do anything advantageous in league. When I asked about couple of VPNs I use for work they never gave me an answer or even acknowledged I asked about it. I didn&#039;t press the matter as I doubt a VPN would of been the issue. \n\nI even had a bunch of snippets from Overwolf which are generated whenever a Kill or Death happened in game. It only had my last bunch of games however I uploaded it and gave it to Riot in hopes that it would help. They ignored it for a long time. Despite my constant attempts to get them to view it they did not even acknowledge I had asked them such a thing. Eventually one outright stated that unless I had video of EVERY SINGLE full match game from the very first time I played league until I got banned &#039;It wouldn&#039;t prove anything.&#039; I tried to argue that just one of those games had to be one I was &#039;triggered&#039; on to help show my innocence but they ignored me yet again. \n\nTaking a different route I tried to ask them what THEY would do in my situation. And getting nothing more then &#039;opening a ticket&#039; they carried on trying to convince me that I had indeed been scripting. \n\nRegardless of how much I insisted that I had not and tried to prove it, I would be ignored simply stating that they had &#039;double checked and confirmed I 100% was.&#039; I asked the ticket to be escalated I asked for a Rioter but they merely repeated the same thing.  \n\nEventually things degraded. They announced that they would no longer listen to me and that they would close any follow up ticket immediately upon my opening it stating that the &#039;issue was resolved in X ticket&#039;. \nMe being at this point frustrated and persistent to prove my innocence reopened the tickets stating that my matter was not resolved and that I had been banned unfairly. This ended up being a series petty copy paste replies from both sides for a couple of days. I was persistent to restore my falsely banned account and I had literally no other option other then to let my account die for no reason what so ever. \n\nFinally a few hours ago I got an email yet again that my ticket was closed. Attempting to log in I found I could not. And upon checking the email I had found that they no longer wanted to deal with me and have removed my zendesk account to stop me from replying. \n\nSo now I am here. Still trucking on too prove my innocence. I did not want to post here as the forums general take on these things as &#039;Guilty until proven innocent.&#039; But as I have no choice. Here I am and that is my story. I hope a Rioter sees this and can help me more then I have been the last few weeks.\n\nKind Regards,\nAntiweapon\n\nUpdate:\nHere is the transcript of the tickets. I skipped. out the dozens of copy paste locked tickets. \nI am unsure if this will in any way help but at the very least it will show that I did all I thought I could via the tickets. \n[Link](http://imgur.com/Ij7wpa6)","replies":[{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2017-04-02T02:26:00.236+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"If you want some attempted help from people on boards then I'd recommend posting your support tickets (make an imgur album or something). Because as you say atm, there isn't much to convince us of your innocence. The fact that over 47 tickets they have still said no is pretty damning. People  have been unbanned from this before when it was a false positive, so what makes your case so different?\n\nAt least with your support tickets visible (ofc remove any personal info) we can have some context. All we have now is your word against theirs and VERY rarely is their word wrong. It doesn't exactly paint you in the best light. Assuming you are innocent, then you would be surprised at the lengths some people will go to to try and recover a bought/boosted/scripted etc account despite the fact they knowingly broke the rules.\n___\nAs a result, in these kind of posts there are four outcomes:\n\nOn boards the most common tends to be that the account owner has given their details to a booster who has then used scripts on the account. Since it doesn't qualify as compromise they lose that account. \n\nThe second is ofc those that are simply lying and are trying to garner sympathy in a long shot hope to get the account back. \n\nThird is compromise, at which point you'll go through the account recovery process to prove ownership, change up your passwords and you'll get the account unbanned (usually, they have no obligation to do this since the account still broke the rules, but we can't say Riot are unreasonable on this one).\n\nAnd very last is a false positive. They don't happen very often at all. More often than not a false positive is triggered by a remnant of some disallowed program that wasn't removed properly (which isn't technically a *false* positive, just a misleading one).\n___\n\nMy point is you have to understand that this doesn't look good for you here. With that many tickets I assume you have talked to multiple support agents, all of whom deemed the ban appropriate. So at least, give us some context.","replies":[{"poster":"Antiweapon","date":"2017-04-02T04:38:23.421+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Okay. I have loaded up the transcript of the tickets. \nI hope it in some way helps. At the very least it I hope it shows I tried to be civil and honest to support about everything I could.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Antiweapon","date":"2017-04-02T02:57:30.927+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hello Seras, \n\nThat's completely fair. I understand that it does not look good for me. And I do understand that Riot does most likely get a huge amounts of these with people who have legitimately earned their bans complaining about it being unfair. Unfortunately It is really hard to prove otherwise as riot cant provide me any information to help convince them and the only information I could provide them was apparently not enough. \n\nIf you believe it will help I can quite happily post a transcript of all the replies from the tickets. However since I have been locked out of the support website I have to go through a huge mountain of emails so give me some time and I will try and get them up here. \n\nIn regards to your potential outcomes. \n\n- Boosting\nI rarely play ranked. And when I do its mostly due to preferring draft due to being able to ban. I am a lowely bronze 3 atm however I was in Silver in season 4 my total ranked games each season probebly was no more then 20 at best.  I hope for this reason its obvious I did not attempt to boost. (If I did I probably shod ask for my money back haha. )\n\n- Lying\nI cant say much as its my word against Riots. As I will show in the tickets soon I really do not see any point to scripting as there is no point to winning a game like this. I get bored of a game if someone on the enemy team leaves and its a 4v5. An unfair game is a boring one. However I understand that you cant just take my word for it. \n\n- Compromise\nI have looked at my match history as I stated for the past year. I didn't go in depth on each game but I couldn't see any point where I suddenly became a diamond 5 vayne. I play almost always exclusively with the same 5 people in my whole time in league and am always in comms with them. If any were in the game with me I can guarantee that it was me playing. \nRiot had also looked into it and stated that I indeed was not compromised. \n\n- False Positive\nI cant say for sure what the cause may be for this in all honestly. The only program I can think of that has been on Riots radar was Curse but as far as I am aware no one was banned for it and I never used it in league, it was merely my addon manager in world of warcraft. That said I would of rarely updated it so maybe that could of been it?\nI have had lolreplay and LSI at one point or another probably over a year now both from my understanding were perfectly acceptable by Riot. \n\nThank you for taking the time to reply. I will take your advice and get the transcript together.","replies":[{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2017-04-02T08:25:48.308+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"The reason Riot doesn't give out specific information regarding these bans is so scripters/3rd party users don't know what was detected (and therefore what wasn't).\n\nAs has been mentioned, Overwolf and Discord have never had any problems. Curse did at one point but Curse fixed on their end and noone was banned for it (afaik) since it was a new precedent Riot had to set. Lolreplay and LSI are both fine however LSI does fall under the \"acceptable but still use at your own risk as we have no control over the changes they make or features they include\" kind of thing. That said I've never heard of anyone banned for LSI, and it wouldn't be an isolated case if something had changed there.\n___\nAs for your tickets (thank you for sharing):\n\nWith regards to the Garen thing you mention, the thread has since been deleted so I don't have context on that, but sounds like an isolated incident kind of thing that was identified and resolved.\n\nThe issue with the recent third party ban wave has since been resolved (was fixed within a day or two of the false bans going out), and I'm pretty sure was isolated to NA, but it may have just looked that way because of the population of OCE (i.e noone on OCE was unlucky enough to be hit by it), but given they only announced it on NA, that makes me thing it was just them.\n\nThere are a lot of claims about Razer Synapse or Razer Cortex causing issues, but it's never these programs in the end. I think there was a point where Cortex caused a few issues, but like the problems with the recent ban wave, it was resolved quickly and is no longer an issue. Most of the threads you mention there fall under first two categories of my first post to you, the reason they are all from similar times is because of the ban wave format that Riot uses for these bans.\n\nAs for the short form responses, Support are very busy, and from their eyes your ticket is basically \"I was banned unfairly and I'm disputing it but it totally looks like I'm lying\". Pair that with the limited information they can actually provide about these bans leaves a short \"sorry we checked but the answer is still no\" as the best answer they can give you. They don't have time to go into the details of each link you sent and provide you with reasons why they were banned (falsely or otherwise).\n\nA text macro or VPN would not cause this either, so they are not your problem.\n\nYou've gone through 10 different support agents and they all said no. Which indicates that there is some very compelling evidence against your account. Sometimes one agent gets it wrong, sometimes even two do, but ten? There has to be something that looks very bad to them on your account.\n\nI would also like to mention that none of these responses are macro responses. They have all the same keywords and all that but those agents are taking the time to actually write back to you. They answer a lot of the same questions (especially about these types of bans) so their responses tend to be pretty similar, but that doesn't mean they aren't treating your case as an individual, it just means they've developed habits over time of what information to include.\n___\nWhat Turexinus Rex said pretty much sums it up. You are saying you are innocent, but all of those agents are sitting there looking at solid proof that not only were the rules broken, but they were broken in such a way it could not have been an accident (3 or 4 of them alluded to this). \n\nFrom what they see they've essentially walked in on you stealing diamonds from a jeweller, and you are trying to convince them it wasn't you, while they are standing there looking at you holding the Diamonds and the glass cutter. There may well be incredibly extraneous circumstances that would lead you to this point as an innocent but it's far less likely than the obvious alternative.\n\nIt's not a matter of them not reading what you have written, rather I think they all did read everything you wrote, but that doesn't change what they see, nor does it change the fact they can't tell you what was detected.\n\nAs for escalating your ticket, I'm not familiar with many of the support peeps but I'm pretty sure it was escalated, and all agents came to the same conclusion. The people above support are likely only in supervisory roles and may not even be affiliated with Riot systems in any way, so upper support is as far as your ticket can go.\n\nAs for them finally banning your support account, you sent them 37 tickets in two weeks about a matter they could not give you any more information on, that is to be expected. It's the same principle as us permanently banning excessive spammers here on boards.\n___\n\nOk I've explained as best I can. I'll do some digging but no promises, I'm trying to stay on the fence with this one but it's difficult to believe your innocence when there is this much stacked against you, though you do get points for not being a total assbag to support (I don't care if you are innocent, being a piece of shit to the people who exist to help you doesn't exactly garner any sympathy nor a desire to help). As little as it is comparative to support I will do what I can though, but you will likely have to be patient.","replies":[{"poster":"Antiweapon","date":"2017-04-02T09:42:27.792+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hello again. \n\nFirst off thanks again for taking the time to reply. \n\nI fully understand why support don't let on what caused the trigger. Unfortunately though that makes refuting a false ban really hard as you have no idea what or when could have caused it. \n\nIn regards to the applications I listed I didn't really have much else to go on. I just looked at what I currently had installed that would in some way have had any interaction with league. \nOther then the ones I listed there isnt much else. Vmware Workstation, ShareX (formally Puush), one drive. Things I wouldn't think would have any interaction at all. \nAs I could not get any information from Support (and I understand why.) I basically had to throw things at them in hopes I hit the mark. \n\nThe garen thing was a long shot. I did notice when the Skim Spotlight guy did a live stream for the practice mode he sometimes was able to double trigger an ability before it went on the 0.5second cooldown. I noticed something similar with Garens E in urf before I was banned so I suspected it could be related. \n\nThe mass accidental ban in NA and a few of the other threads I listed were more to show that the system wasent infailable. I was mostly trying to make a point that support have been wrong in the past. A couple of times only after a Rioter jumped into the thread and picked up  something support did not. I really did not have much to go on but that seemed to be one of the few times I saw these matters get resolved I obviously don't know how many people are banned falsely and who is just trying to cheat their way out of a deserved ban. Hence why I tried to get one of 'those' Rioters to jump in. Someone with more visibility or whatever it is that makes them be able to resolve the cases support cannot. It was a long shot but I thought asking for someone with more visibility would surely help  find the problem. \n\nI gathered something has me looking really guilty. And I fully understand why 10 people confirming as much makes it look really bad. But if you see it from my perspective I didnt really have any idea what else to do other then to reopen the ticket and keep fighting. \n\nAnd as for the macro responses thing. I know they did not just copy and paste a reply I probably should of worded it better. It was more that I was getting the same information again and again. I get that something is plastering a big guilty on my forehead. I believe the support team that something is amiss for them to believe it and stand by it. It was more that I felt that they followed the same procedures as the last and I was trying to push for some new development to be made to look else ware, as you probably could of figured I felt frustrated as I felt I was going around in circles. \n\nAnd I know my spamming ticket after ticket was stubborn but I felt like I had no choice and I had n other means of trying to convince them. \n\nI have no rush I can wait months if needed. I just want to make sure everything possible is done to potentially fix this. \n\nAs for support I don't see any reason to yell and be vulgar to them. Being rude can only hinder my chances of getting this fairly resolved and as I have also worked in a support role before I can understand how frustrating it can be getting assholes day after day. \n\nI can also supply you with my complete match history here ( I believe you can only see my ranked games?) and my videos I mentioned in the ticket via link on a PM. They have my comms on it so I refrained from putting the links on the screenshot of the tickets as I am unsure if my friends would want their QQing on mumble listed publicly. \n\nRegardless of the outcome I thank you for taking the time to help me again I know its a big ask.","replies":[{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2017-04-02T10:33:33.896+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I understand the frustration, both sides have hit a wall.

So i should just accept my fate and not do anything despite the fact you guys most likely wont notice the mistake ever?\n\nAnd you dont see anything wrong with that at all?\n\nI am not sure how you expect me to just take that and be a ok with it.\n\nI completely understand that you get cheaters that do lie and try pull on heartstrings. I have seen that constantly in the time I have been browsing these forums for answers.\n\nI have seen you savagely shut these people down before.. again and again. I believe you when you say people play nice to try trick you guys.\n\nHowever you cannot say that your hands are completly tied. The rules are made and enforced by you and your team. The fact that no means exist for people like me to proove their worth is quite frankly insane.\nYou preach reform and second chances and with verbal abuse cases there are three hurdles to jump before you end up perma banned. Whereas i get tripped by the wrong stars aligning and get hit with the hardest punishment with no chance at 'reforming'.\n\nAt this point i am not asking for a quick solution. I am asking for A solution. \n\nBan me for a year.\nMake me sign some legal mumbo jumbo.\nI can come to oce hq and talk with your janitor if itll help.\n\nAnything at all. You really cannot expect me to leave it.\n\nI cannot even dedicate myself to a new account because I have no idea what hit the first one... I fully expect my alt to ne banned eventually because nothing has changed on my pc since I have received this ban.\n\nLeague was one of my favourites games... to just be treated as collateral and pushed to the dirt is insanly depressing.\n\nI am BEGGING you to take some initiative and talk to the right people about what can be done... not simply following a protocol.\n\nI am the one with my hands tied.. not you.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Antiweapon","date":"2017-05-25T12:23:02.182+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Riot Gehirn,realm=OCE,application-id=T8eq2lFQ,discussion-id=HjzEOAEB,comment-id=000000040000,timestamp=2017-05-08T00:33:58.407+0000)\n>\n> We don&#x27;t instantly permaban players for their first offence.

Rage/cheat ect. Some people don't or do so as a one off and learn. Fortunately they will get a slap on the wrist with a 14 day ban. Potentially fix their behavior ect (in extreme cases a straight up perma but seeing some of the logs of the 14 day banns it would have to be pretty extreme. )\n\nIn my case i have no forewarning. No 'hey fix this up' just straight up ban from using a program so good not even the user had any idea it was there (and still cant find it). Why can I not get the same act of kindness that the guy that told someone to kill themselves got? It would mean the world to me and very little effort to just ban me again if I turned out to be lying. \n\nOnce again i know you have no power to influence anything. But I really want to make my point about it i feel like there is no reason why I cant ask for the same sort of chance to prove myself as some of the most horrid people on earth.\n\nAnd most likely Gehirm will either tell me the same thing again or no longer reply.

Obviously if found to be innocent someone banned for third party will get their account back. I said I'd leave the rest to Gehirn because I don't get specifics, nor can I see any of what he sees from the compromise end or what he gets from anti-cheat, so I'm not in a position to make a judgement call.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Antiweapon","date":"2017-05-25T22:56:35.008+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I have to disagree on some points here. \nMost flaming and rudeness I have witnessed isn't simply 'emotion based' its attitude based. A one off game where you loose your cool is fine and fair enough and fits that bill. However most people I have seen generally have some sort of self entitlement and a rude game after game after game regardless of teams performance. It is not simply loosing your cool. If it was that I am sure there would be very very few people that got to the point where they were permabanned for it. \nBecause of this I do consider something such as flaming somewhat 'premeditated'. Telling someone to 'go kill themselves' is not something someone does just purely out of anger. And these people can get hundreds of reports before finally falling under this category and even have a forewarning beforehand in the form of the 14 day ban. \n\nWhile Cheating is a premeditated decision there are a number of reasons where the same logic applies. Someone getting their account compromised, sitting at a netcafe pc that has had some form of cheat application installed, having a family computer where a family member did use scripts. These people tend to fall under the permaban and no chance category. There is no doubt in my mind that there are a number of people who have been wrongfully banned because of something downright impossible to control they have 0 chance of 'reforming' of 'prooving' this. \n\nLike it or not but what I am saying is true. I have absolutely no idea how I got banned if there is someway to prove it I will, you know this because I keep mentioning that I would do whatever it takes to convince you. If something did get onto my pc. Had I known something was amiss I would of immediately stopped and removed the application and notified riot that this had happened.  \n\nIn my case it was not a 'premediated' decision. And if the scripts were in games that I played I dont think they influenced me in any way shape or form. \n\nThe situation is not as black and white as you make it out to be. Like it or not you know that there are a large number of people who most likely got banned unfairly.\n\nSome behavior cannot be reformed. Just as some '3rd party applications' bans were issued to players with no intent to cheat. That is all I am trying to put out here.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Antiweapon","date":"2017-04-28T09:03:39.081+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thanks.

For full disclosure, I _am_ Antiweapon's friend and we have played plenty of games together over the years. I don't know how much good I can be as a character witness or anything within that capacity, but I'd like to chime in anyway, and while I'm sure other people have had friends and \"friends\" chime in over similar matters beforehand, I invite you to review my match history to establish that A) I play with Antiweapon on a regular basis and have done so for nearly four years, and B) I am also a terrible player.\nIn hindsight, perhaps you shouldn't look over it too closely, unless you wish to blind yourself with some shining examples of my games. I'm an average Lux at best, and terrible at everything else.\n\nHaving known him for so many years I can safely say he is without a doubt one of the most stubborn pieces of shhh---uh... people I have ever met, and to say that he has been actively working his hardest with Riot Support to prove his innocence and get his Account back is an understatement. For the past two weeks, I've gotten messages from him _every day_ about the issue while we're at work, I've helped him trawl through our shared Match Histories for the exceedingly rare games where he has done well, I mean, hell, when I went over to visit him during this past weekend, the _first_ thing he fucking shows me when I get there are the Support tickets and conversations. At one point, we just started cracking jokes at what the title of the ticket was going to end up as because of how many Re: 's had been added over the past two weeks. Riot's Support team literally had to lock him out, because they couldn't deal with his pigheadedness. \n\nHere's the deal, we're both Bronze ranked, we don't always play the game particularly seriously, and we have maybe two or three champs that we actually do decently with, and I get that there are literally hundreds of thousands like us playing this game and that statistically we're the most likely to be using Scripts and Third Party programs of some kind. It's not just a matter of statistics, people who play as casually as us are probably the most inclined to use Scripts like these specifically because there is an inherent mentality that we're the most likely to get away with it. I understand all that. All prior evidence is stacked against us here, and no one likes having their accounts banned, especially unjustly, and I get that Riot Support have had to deal with plenty of stubborn idiots who all claim that they were banned unjustly, whether truthfully or not.\n_However_, to outright refuse to communicate with a Player who has done everything he can to help prove himself, who has gone beyond just the standard Questionnaire that they supply and has consulted alternative sources, done the research, and gone out of their way to find and upload any evidence of potentially suspicious activity, is nothing but pure and utter negligence.\n\nWe're not asking for a whole lot here, just someone higher up on the chain with less restrictions than Riot's standard Support team to give this case another full review and to give my friend here a proper chance to absolve himself. If not for _him_, than for do it for _my_ sake so he can stop bothering me about it every. Goddamned.
