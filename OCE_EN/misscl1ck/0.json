I know there has been many discussions on how to drain the IP that just lingers. I think it would be a great idea to have a &quot;IP for Charity&quot; day or something along the lines of that. Where players can choose, for the week, to convert IP into money for charity. For example 1000IP = $1 for a certain charity. \nAnyways, just an idea. I hope riot invest in this idea :)!","replies":[{"poster":"JasonWazza","date":"2016-02-25T13:28:19.097+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"No one would be against donating, but it's not a sound business choice for Riot, there are 100's of thousands of players on every single server that have IP left over, and that could be anywhere between $50-$100 per person at least (a lot of pros tend to have about $250 worth as an example)\n\nIt would make more sense for riot to allow IP to convert into RP because then they aren't just giving out more money than they earn (people can easily earn $1 a day, if they play league a decent amount, if not a $1 every 4-5 days getting first wins of the day) because that is essentially what would happen in this scenario.","replies":[{"poster":"MissCl1ck","date":"2016-02-25T16:07:30.548+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I didn't mean for this to be a permanent option, just a one off event, maybe once a year.
