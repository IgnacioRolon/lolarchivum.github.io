It really impacts on my will to play ranked, because it makes the things I do in games feel worthless when at the end of the day if I win 3 games with a friend I can still go up against a 3 man party and lose it all.","replies":[{"poster":"Hyde","date":"2016-07-29T14:27:15.548+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I think playing solo is like an entirely new challenge in itself. Its like carrying yourself rather than getting help. It results in more exciting wins and to be honest, I play better by myself because most of my friends don't take ranked seriously or are just Bronze 5 scrub lords who think rammus adc is the new Meta... but I know what you mean about how it is unfair that solo queue players get matched against groups, I think they just need to make it 100% solo and then have a separate queue for groups of 5. and if you just wanna play with one or two friends, then just play normals until you get a few extra people. That way you could take ranked seriously as a team and also as a solo queue player ... dynamic queue was not the best idea riot has ever had ... I don't really understand why they even did it. I mean it is nice to always get the roll you want... pretty much but it leaves a lot to be desired in terms of match making time and game balance.","replies":[{"poster":"JasonWazza","date":"2016-07-29T14:49:54.838+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The reason they told us they implemented Dynamic is because of people asking to play ranked with their friends.\n\nIronically i think more people complain since dynamic has come into being.\n\nI wouldn't be surprised if Riot cave and Season 7 is solo queue.","replies":[{"poster":"Hyde","date":"2016-07-29T15:56:28.108+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Lel, yea I feel that.

You get an Emblem that shows you play mostly solo (I love how Rito added it as if it means anything at all and is a good solution for dynamic queue).\n\nI still can't believe they don't have an Emblem called Fire Emblem.
