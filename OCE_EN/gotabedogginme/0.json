R.I.P. {{champion:72}} .\r\n\r\nSo If this isn&#039;t Riot just having a laugh and it&#039;s seriously gonna happen, I&#039;ve been working on a concept for a replacement Hide and Seek mode. Now I&#039;m sure you may be thinking, &#039;Which map is this gonna be on? There&#039;s no possible way to do it on &quot;The Howling Abyss&quot;, and &quot;Twisted Treeline&quot; is just too damn small, and really nowhere to hide.\r\n\r\nSo yes, the idea is to go to Summoners Rift. However there are a few issues that need confrontation. \r\n1. No passive EXP or Gold gain\r\n2. How do we stop minions from pushing down towers before the game ends?\r\n3. How do we make sure its fair for both seekers and hiders?\r\n\r\nSo because I play and main backwards champs and roles. Lets begin with the last problem first. How to make it fair\r\nFirst lets deal with how many players are on each team.\r\nIt&#039;s gonna have to be 5 v 5\r\n\r\nHere&#039;s how it will work. At any given time, there will be 2 hiders, from the blue team and 2 seekers from the red team allowed, ONLY in the jungle. 1 Hider and 1 seeker will go to the top side jungle and the other pair will go to the bottom side jungle, and play as per usual rules. (Seeker has to kill hider, hider can only use cc, and CANNOT build just tank (I&#039;m looking at you spirit visage). Also, while seeker and hider are active, they cannot kill any jungle camps, as their whole purpose is to find or run away from each other.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile the other 3 pairs are dealing with the other 2 issues.\r\nEach of the 3 pairs are sitting in a 1v1 lane, (Top, Mid or Bot) however all they are doing, is essentially being Nasus.{{champion:75}}  They just sit in their respective lane and farm cs and experience. DO NOT KILL OR TRADE DAMAGE WITH EACH OTHER AND DO NOT TAKE ANY TOWERS. Yes i know its so very tempting to just jump on them and kill them, but seriously just don&#039;t. The whole idea is fairness right? The whole good mannered, sportsmanship stuff? Yeah, that would be nice to see.\r\n\r\nNow comes the slightly tricky part to understand. \r\nWhen a hider is killed, the respective players from both teams that have the most cs (indicating they are the most fed). Now this pair doesn&#039;t have to be from the same lane. As long as any given seeker has no more than 1 more kill than any other. For example if one seeker has 4 kills and another has 3, the seeker with 4 kills is not allowed to become &#039;active&#039; again. This system is also used when picking which hider goes &#039;active&#039; but with deaths instead of kills.\r\n\r\nThis system ensures that everyone gets a fair shot and an equal opportunity to actually go and play.\r\n\r\nAs usual banned items for SEEKERS are:\r\n{{item:3092}} {{item:3742}} {{item:3363}} {{item:3340}} {{item:3364}} {{item:3341}} {{item:2045}} {{item:2049}} {{item:2303}} {{item:2302}} {{item:2301}} \r\nYes Trinkets are banned and warding items are banned, Sorry {{champion:64}} \r\nBanned Champions For SEEKERS are:\r\n{{champion:107}} {{champion:28}} {{champion:35}} \r\nBanned Summoner Spells (yes I&#039;m Serious)\r\n{{summoner:11}} {{summoner:2}} \r\n\r\nBanned Champions for Hiders are:\r\n{{champion:17}} {{champion:28}} {{champion:107}} {{champion:35}} \r\nBanned items for HIDERS are:\r\nAll of the above items, except, {{item:3742}} \r\nAlso{{item:3026}} {{item:3075}} {{item:3116}} \r\nAnd any item that does NOT give passive or active move-speed\r\nFor Example:{{item:3065}} {{item:3068}} {{item:3110}} {{item:3071}}  Is Banned. The name of the game is hide and seek, not tank and taunt.\r\nOnce again the summoner spells{{summoner:11}} {{summoner:2}}  are both banned.\r\n\r\nThis is only a concept at the moment, so feel free to comment with any input that would be productive to finding a new way to play hide and seek. If you want to talk to and bitch about rito being unfair, I really just don&#039;t give a damn. But Feel free to Post any ideas.","replies":[{"poster":"Captain Cancer","date":"2016-02-21T10:39:38.646+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You could make it like a special version where towers don't work, exp and gold are on, etc. like riot can make it a sanctioned rotational mode, that'd be awesome","replies":[]}]}
