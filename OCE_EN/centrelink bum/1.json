I mainly go jungling so I have free roam almost all game. However, whenever I play top lane for example and their jungler consistently camps me, I get really frustrated and it makes me not want to play the game anymore.\r\n\r\nSo when I jungle, I feel guilty to camp a lane, even though my team gets angry at me just so I camp one but since I know how it feels to get camped, I try not to stick to it as much because I know it sucks not being able to play a game.\r\n\r\nIs there anyone else like this or am I just too soft?","replies":[{"poster":"Sunlit Earth","date":"2015-04-21T17:06:30.317+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I don't feel guilty whatsoever.. it's a game, you know, it's nothing personal. You camp a lane probably because there's benefit there for you to do so. It's not your problem how the other person feels about it, vice versa. If someone approached me and told me, without attacking me personally, that it was upsetting them that I was camping their lane, I might apologise for the upset feelings, but I wouldn't change how I played the game because of it.","replies":[]},{"poster":"jb3navides","date":"2015-04-20T08:03:38.605+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"***","replies":[{"poster":"JasonWazza","date":"2015-04-21T05:57:23.192+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'd say it's support that gets abused more, but it is really rather close.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"WEETBIX 4 BREKKI","date":"2015-04-20T12:10:35.535+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"take it from a professional team player (me) if someone gives you trouble, give them back 10 times more, pretend to gank their lane and flash out when they're dying, have a good giggle, ask them if they're mad, then watch some youtube, or just mute everyone before a game starts if you think they're going to be toxic, it's very possible to play a game just reading pings.","replies":[]}]}
