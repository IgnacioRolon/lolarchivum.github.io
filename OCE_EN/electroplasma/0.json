I love the guy, So far my favorite Champ.. His moves and his skins just look so amazing and beautiful! and is kinda a joy to play..\r\nBut I always have trouble against almost every mid laner..\r\n\r\nIt seems nobody picks mages mid anymore so all I come up against are assassins and such with blinks and close range attacks.. I always lose (probably because I don&#039;t know how to handle it idk) or at the least hug my tower while they dominate the lane...\r\n\r\nLate game my god is he great.. and sometimes I even come back and win against an incredibly hard lane just because his Passive is so strong when you have a ton of AP BUT I think his Q needs a bit of a buff... Mainly just having it so there is no _Delay_ on the second activation...\r\n\r\nI don&#039;t understand why his stun has a delay? so many other characters have bullshit insta stuns but his has this weird delay that makes it impossible to hit someone in your face... So you have to rely on your ult which may already be down because you had to deal with his team mate a second ago!\r\n\r\nHis Q is already on an insanely long cooldown Which I don&#039;t mind but to have it miss is a big deal and when you can&#039;t physically hit someone its just unfair.. And maybe I don&#039;t see the unbalance if his stun can insta activate.. I can only feel it helps more.. \r\n\r\n**Again maybe I just don&#039;t know the real reason Riot did it IDK I&#039;m bronze 1 so :3**","replies":[{"poster":"Sneed","date":"2016-05-28T13:25:51.108+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"aurelion sol is just like bard\n\nliterally useless\n\nexcept for that ONE guy who carries your ass\n\ni hope you meet that guy and learn from what he does","replies":[]},{"poster":"Aidan7787","date":"2016-05-28T02:23:13.871+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You should look up Bjergsen stream on youtube and watch how he plays him.
