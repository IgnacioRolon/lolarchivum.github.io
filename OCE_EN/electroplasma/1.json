I feel like I was getting duped by a group or something..

At least they have made a delay so when to call at the same time the system will work out who actually posted first and give everyone the same order. But yea if you join late you may not see some of the chat","replies":[]},{"poster":"Dracuula","date":"2016-05-27T07:06:06.950+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"He lied to you","replies":[{"poster":"ElectRoPlasMa","date":"2016-05-27T07:26:40.538+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Man I'm really hurt..
