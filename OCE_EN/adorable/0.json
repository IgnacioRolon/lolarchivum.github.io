I have one for all of the other major platforms I use - Steam, Battle.net, Gmail, Facebook etc. so why isn&#039;t there one for League too? I (and I&#039;m sure many others) value their League account as much as their precious Steam and Blizzard accounts; League falls into that category too, yet has no mobile authenticator app or at least 2 step SMS code verification. League is a popular platform with a huge player base and we deserve to have additional security options for our accounts.\r\n\r\nc&#039;mon rito {{sticker:zombie-brand-clap}}","replies":[{"poster":"Wuks","date":"2016-06-22T14:57:25.337+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Currently 2FA is only enabled for when account information is being changed.
