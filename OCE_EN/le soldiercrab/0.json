It is severely unfair. For the SECOND time, I have received five, twenty-minute low priority queue wait times. Why? Because I left a game for 3-5 minutes because my computer crashed. Not only that, but I rejoined and actually WON that game, but to my surprise the logic of LeaverBuster has stuck a huge dildo into my anus once again, slapping me with &quot;Low Priority Queue&quot;. TWICE this has happened, and to be completely honest, this system needs to be scrapped or HEAVILY modified because it DOES NOT work at all. I understand that Riot isn&#039;t going to do anything, because it is evident through multiple support tickets that they don&#039;t care that I have been falsely placed in LPQ, but PLEASE for the love of all that is holy, fix or replace this system. People are punished for leaving games, OK, but what if the power goes out? What if the game crashes? What if someone has broken into their house, dog dies, earthquake, ETC. Taking out the bad people isn&#039;t worth the enjoyment of the good people. My LoL game is having BAD problems right now, BSoD every game. But the thing is, I&#039;m not going to know if LoL is fixed or not UNLESS I play, but I guess I got my punishment for assuming that even though the game was won and I returned that I wouldn&#039;t get 360 noscoped by Riot. GG no RE. \r\n\r\nTL;DR Leaver Buster punishes innocent people for crimes they didn&#039;t intentionally commit, and that is dumb.","replies":[{"poster":"Hyp3rR4bb1T","date":"2015-06-03T10:25:48.410+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I do not want to write too much but I have an idea.\n\nWhat if they made a system in which players with ribbons (i.e. good behaviour) can vote on an LPQ case or something similar. Basically, players who are in good standings with riot can judge those who present cases like being put in the LPQ but they had a power cut, laptop crash etc. \n\nThis way riot does not have to fund anyone working for LeaverBuster so that problem is more or less gone. \nIt can also be done in sort of a jury way, in that players with ribbons have to judge at least one case a week \n\nI know this is not a perfect idea but at least it will be a start.","replies":[{"poster":"HORSE OF FORCE","date":"2015-06-18T13:31:25.909+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":">Tribunal\n\nIt'll come back...\n\nwhen the blue moon rises...","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Chrysonyx","date":"2015-09-14T00:15:22.309+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I agree that this system is really annoying. The best system, I think that makes both Riot and the LB victims happy, is to remove COMPLETELY the waiting time. However, low priority should stay but in a different sense. 1st time in LB, 5 games of low priority (LP), 2nd 10 LP, 3rd, 20 LP, and 4th 50 LP. Also players that leave or AFK cannot gain xp from games, even if their team wins. Now you may be saying, what about the team that loses a team member due to LB? The answer.... player buffs. What are player buffs? Well it works this way, if a player leave the game in say a standard 5v5 Summoners Rift, then the players gain a buff which makes them 25% stronger in ALL areas (HP/Mana/Cooldown Duration). Why 25%? Well its all in math. 5 players per team, so 1 player is 1/5 of team (easy right). So if one player leaves, then that leaves 4/5. Because there are 4 players that need to be as strong as 5 players, the way to balance it out is distribute 1/5 (from lost team member) to every remaining player so 25% of the lost player. So essentially, the 4 players after the buff are mathematically as good as the 5 players. Of course this depends on a lot of variables for \"truly\" balancing the game but it sure is a lot better than waiting for 20 min. or losing because a guy left to go to the bathroom. This also works if multiple people leave on a same game. So if 2 people leave to LB, then the boost is 66% to each player, if 3 150%, if 4 well its simply 400%. Obviously this where LB should be discouraged. Players that enter LB should lose some IP because of abandoning a match. Also they are restricted from creating games until the allotted number of games is finished. If the players with less win, then they are also given a percent more amount of XP and IP. \n\nAnyways think about this system, not only does it punish brutally enough but it encourges players to stay in the game even more so that they can gain more!\n\n\nThe formula I used to determine player buff is this.  _**(# of players lost/ players remaining)**_","replies":[]},{"poster":"HORSE OF FORCE","date":"2015-04-19T11:11:44.118+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":">BSoD every game\n\nIn this day and age, if your computer is still getting that then there is something severely wrong with your system.\n\nUnless you're purposefully using an old OS. Which is totally up to you, but honestly you should be expecting something like that to happen when running modern games on it.\n\nI agree with you on your suggestion to rework Leavebuster, even if it's just in the form of making it more lax. Five minutes is just too quick to be considered, \"Left the game completely and to the detriment of the team\".\n\nAlso, Riot's policy is to never remove any low priority queues applied to accounts. Probably because if they made exceptions then literally *everyone* would ask for it to be removed from their account.","replies":[{"poster":"Le Soldiercrab","date":"2015-04-25T06:11:31.326+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"There really isn't anything \"wrong\" with my system. I'm led to believe it is the games fault because every other game I play runs smoothly. Team Fortress 2, Garrys Mod, L4D2 (On medium-high settings as well). I highly doubt that any of these games require LESS than League of Legends. Also, League has ran perfectly fine for the past year or so with no issues, and the last thing I downloaded is a patch for League -_- My computer fully meets the minimum requirements to play, (and recommended)  so...?\n\nAlso, the excuse Riot gives for not lifting low priority queue is just a huge wad of bullshit. There is NO way anyone could be so god damn stupid to actually believe everyone who gets some sort of punishment is worthy of it. STATISTICALLY it would be almost impossible for at least a SINGLE (1) false accusation of crime. ESPECIALLY when they know something is wrong. I've sent a support ticket addressing the crashes and my LPQ, and even though they have indisputable evidence that I have not intentionally left game, still persist in the \"No Exceptions\" rule. Which just blows my mind because of how, just, UGHHHHH. I want to know who decided this was a good idea and who gave the go-ahead on it, because it just makes no sense.","replies":[{"poster":"HORSE OF FORCE","date":"2015-04-26T06:08:25.434+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Well, Riot knows that everyone who gets Leavebuster'd may not be done so in the manner which they deserver. They also know that players who get banned for other reasons may not have actually deserved the ban. The system will never be perfect, because humans are not. Back to my point, it brings them to the conclusion that if they were to allocate enough resources into investigating whether or not every single punish that's handed out by their system is just or not, then they wouldn't have anything to do anything else with. So by just saying, \"We'll never lift these penalties,\" they save all those resources, while still having a relatively healthy community because of the discouragement to leave games.\n\nIt's a trade-off.\n\nIf you'd really like it to be changed, then become a millionaire with enough funding to support a small community of people who continually monitor and maintain the punishment system to ensure the healthy environment for the community to play, in addition to having a ban system for that meta-community as well (to prevent corrupt and other malicious activity). Then you'll have to get resources for that...\n\nAnyway, about your computer,\n\nThose other games you mentioned that also run on your computer all use the Valve engine. Have you tried a game with a different engine, like DOTA or other mainstream games (Saint's Row, CoD, The Crew, etc.)? It could just be that Valve are really good when it comes for programming for compatibility.\n\nDo you have service packs/their equivalent installed on your system? They usually go far in ensuring your system can still run modern programs.\n\nHave you tried fooling your graphics driver into thinking your system is something it's not? Some drivers are programmed to just not function if it detects you're not using it on its intended system. You can try running it in an emulator to do this.","replies":[]}]}]}]}
