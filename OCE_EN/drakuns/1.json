Below is one of the 3 that are nearly the same.\r\n\r\nSo I played with the classic bad players, a mid lane that had 0 8 2  damage in 25 minutes a bot lane 0 9,  im jungle and they are pushing there lanes or dieing so I cant gank also this same game I have a darius that&#039;s dced for the 1st 13 minutes of the game.\r\nThey abuse me for not ganking... Classic right but they don&#039;t have anything to report me for so they all report me for chat, the report does not show what they say just what I say, System is not right bad players reporting good players for nothing and I get a bad mark against me and chat restricted.\r\n\r\n\r\nThanks for reading sorry for being a sook I love this game I just hate getting put in game spots like this.\r\nThey have a mute button","replies":[{"poster":"Tele","date":"2016-02-26T03:32:09.815+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey man,\n\nIt would be great if you could provide a few of your chat logs, so me and the community can give you a few tips on what might have gone wrong. \nOtherwise, here's a few things I'd like to clear up:\n\n+ _\"They have a mute button\"._\n\n The existence of a mute button doesn't validate unacceptable behavior in any way. The mute button is there to protect players from further verbal abuse. It is not there to be used as an excuse for poor behavior and language.\n\n Either way, I'm sure you can see that under your logic there is a double-standard. \n\n _Why didn't you just \"use the mute button\", when they verbal abused you for not ganking?_\n\nIf these players did verbally abuse you, then they should be punished. The existence of a mute button does not change this. Keep in mind though, this also applies to yourself.\n\n+ _Being verbally abused isn't an excuse to do the same._\n\n Just because some players abuse you, does not give you **any** right to do the same. If you do chose to exhibit bad behavior, you become just as bad as them and will be punished under the same terms.\n\n The report system is not there to allow \"victims\" to harass others without consequence. The purpose of the system is to fix and correct bad behavior, no matter who it's from.\n\n+  _\"Unskilled players are reporting good players and putting them in bad standing.\"_\n\n I may have misunderstood this but, I'll clarify anyway;\n\n Lack of skill or anything similar is not reportable at all. No summoner shall **ever** be discriminated against by the player reform system, for skill, KDA or rank. These are **not** acceptable reasons to harass a teammate or player.\n\nI hope this helps. \n\nIf you still think you were reported unfairly, I recommend you send a [support ticket](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/requests/new), or post your chat logs here. If it turns out that in fact you were reported unfairly, I promise we'll get it fixed. Otherwise we can go over what could have gone wrong.","replies":[]},{"poster":"K1ng Leon1das","date":"2016-03-05T08:31:19.799+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Dont worry the report system and the tribunal is fucked. I've just been perma banned today for the most ridiculous reason. The 3 game chat review in the ban is so mellow its not funny. People are just too Butt hurt and dont know what a mute button it. Hundreds of dollars gone cause some piece of shit reported me and got me banned. So 1 thing to make sure either dont chat at all. Or dont play the game only way out of it","replies":[]},{"poster":"MeJewGold","date":"2016-02-26T20:33:47.996+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"You also have to understand alot of people play with their friends so they will get them to report you as well it's also part of harassment on the game the system doesn't take into account what you said at all it copies it and posts it when restricting you but one time all i said was random things when someone was swearing at me example- bananas , spoon, porkchops, ham things like that even are considered to be verbal abuse which is rediculous and u will get banned or restriced riot really needs to fix their system and if they dont just get rid of it all together and let ppl duke it out in game its not like anyone is dying over silly comments..","replies":[{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2016-02-27T00:41:10.982+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It only takes one report to trigger a punishment or an investigation.

People with nice chats don't need to point it out, for good reason, they have nothing to point out.\n\nBut as Telecasterdude has said, just because somebody says/does something doesn't give you the right to run your mouth. As hard as it is watching that Panth ulting into the enemy nexus for the 10th time today, you just got to keep your mouth shut and remember that you get to report them and move on at the end of the game.","replies":[]},{"poster":"LemonHunter","date":"2016-02-26T01:54:38.731+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"If they had reported you without you saying anything bad, the reports would have been ignored and there would be no restriction placed against you.\n\nIf, however, you had been abusing them (even in retaliation) then there is merit for punishment, which would have happened for you to receive the punishment.\n\nI know it's hard and sucks when people have a bad game and try to blame it on you. My suggestion would be to (nicely) in chat say something along the lines of \"ok, we are off to a bad start but we can come back. I'll gank more in mid and bot but can you not push your lane up so far so I can get in and gank?\" If you don't wish to do this (as you feel you may be abusive) or if you try to be nice and turn the game around but they keep abusing you, mute the players so you remove the temptation to be abusive to them. Then remember to report those players that are abusing you.\n\nDefinitely take this as a learning experience and try to keep your cool. If you do, there is no reason you can get punished any further :)\n{{sticker:slayer-pantheon-thumbs}}","replies":[]}]}
