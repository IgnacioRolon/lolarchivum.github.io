Hey guys, I read somewhere that the earth is flat, since I read it somewhere it ***MUST*** be true. (Are you starting to see the failure in logic here?)\n\nFact is the \"unskilled\" report option forces the system to look through your match history to determine if you are being matched with the right people by looking at various stats throughout your match history. Just because people report you for that, even if it's common, doesn't mean it will have an effect on the way you are matched with other players.\n\n> 12 games straight I lost due to toxic/unskilled players.\n\nLets look at this objectively:\n\nAssuming one AFK/DC/feeder/toxic/unskilled in every game (which is highly unlikely at most) and assuming my calculations are correct:\n44% chance for a single person AFK/DC/feeder/toxic/unskilled on your team for one game.\n19.36% chance for a single person AFK/DC/feeder/toxic/unskilled on your team for two games.\n8.52% (rounded up to two decimal places) chance for a single person AFK/DC/feeder/toxic/unskilled on your team for three games.\n3.75% (rounded up to two decimal places) chance for a single person AFK/DC/feeder/toxic/unskilled on your team for four games.\n1.65% (rounded up to two decimal places) chance for a single person AFK/DC/feeder/toxic/unskilled on your team for five games.\n\nOver 12 games it comes down to 0.00005% chance for you to be losing consecutive games as a direct result of \"bad team mates\". That means if you had 1,000,000 people then, statistically, only 5 of those people would experience such a thing and the fact remains theory is different from practice. In reality it could vary between about 0-10 people, and there's no way you're going to convince me you're one of those extremely unlucky individuals.\n\nThe thing that probably gets me most is that you are here blaming \"bad team mates\" when the main issue is your skill and attitude. Looking through your match history I can see that *sometimes* you get decent stats and *on occasion* you do well, but certainly not the kind of thing where I would say you aren't as high as you should be. In fact, given your stats and attitude, I might even argue you are a little high in rank.","replies":[{"poster":"Drakuns","date":"2015-08-19T09:11:39.376+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Dude if you look at the players that im put with not my score at the end of the game u will see in my last 5 games bottom lane has got total scores of like 5 22 5 and 0 20 6 or something, and its these sorts of teams that report players(unskilled players able to report skilled players)\nBy the end of these games because of these players the enemy team out lvls and can most of the time group and kill a good player easy.","replies":[{"poster":"Project Xayah","date":"2015-08-19T12:43:13.525+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> its these sorts of teams that report players\n\nExcept you've litterally provided proof in this thread that such players reports would have no effect on how you are matched.
