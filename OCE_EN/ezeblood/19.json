However, I feel that being based off of health for ability costs of a role that is meant to be squishy seems slightly weird. I like your direction and where this could go if it were implemented. 7/10\n\tB: Team Based Gameplay - The idea that rending the enemies stats down can open up pathways for more diverse supports, possibly bringing control mages into a support category when allied with Rusken to capitalise on the lowered stats fully. This could well change the Team Based Gameplay environment entirely. 9/10\n\tC: Foe Based Gameplay - This seems like it would be incredibly frustrating to play against, having your 6th spell cast on Rusken being completely ignored would just be too strong. At this stage, his ultimate is also far too frustrating to play against. This could seriously ruin the team fight landscape. Tone down the range to make the ability a self peel and it may be less frustrating. At the moment, 3/10.\n\tTotal: 19/30\n\n2: Castor - The Justice Seeker - Newsonts\n\tA: Individual Gameplay - 0\n \tB: Team Based Gameplay - 0\n \tC: Foe Based Gameplay - 0\n         Sorry mate, I just couldn&#039;t get a grasp on this one to be able to judge it effectively.\n \tTotal: 0\n\n3: Kor&rsquo;Vein - The Volatile Soldier - Corvis Colvein\n\tA: Individual Gameplay - This champion seems similar to Gnar on the basis of involuntary transformations. In this case, I think the concept could be hard to grasp for beginners to the champion, however with time and practice this could be a really powerful mechanic. 7/10\n\tB: Team Based Gameplay - The idea that when Kor&rsquo;Vein dies he deals damage around him to both allied and enemy units could be used against his team. Generally, Riot sticks away from teamkiller abilities like this, except for a few bugs that slipped through with Taric and Tahm Kench. Anyways, it could be fun, It could be detrimental. 5/10\n\tC: Foe Based Gameplay - Just the thought of going through a fight against this monstrosity sends chills down my spine. This could be the next juggernaut. And we all know how much the community loves juggernauts. 4/10\n\tTotal: 16/30\n\n4: Avespria - The Hivemind - Caress of Venus\n\tA: Individual Gameplay - Avespria seems like a supportive mage, but correct me if I&rsquo;m wrong. Given we&rsquo;ve just had two consecutive releases of supportive mages, I can see Avespria fitting into the current meta fairly well.  She also seems fairly user friendly, not having too many overloaded skills or mechanics. Overall, good job on this point. 9/10\n\tB: Team Based Gameplay - The idea of being slowed while coated in honey is great, and fits perfectly thematically. I love it! and it&rsquo;s really team-oriented because it lets the whole team catch up, instead of giving Avespria a MS buff so that she outruns her team. 8/10\n\tC: Foe Based Gameplay - As with most supportive mages (except annie), it&rsquo;s pretty hard to feel bad when you die against them. And the fact that it&rsquo;s a bee just makes it all the more lighthearted. 8/10\n\tTotal: 25/30\n\n5: Tsuki and Taiyo - The Sun and The Moon - CookedChickens\n\tA: Individual Gameplay - This champion, as you have said, would be very difficult to pick upend play right off the bat. It would require an absolute knowledge of the map at all times, to be able to capitalise on effectively having 6 champions. However, once this barrier is passed, the possibilities for Tsuki and Taiyo are limitless. 6/10\n\tB: Team Based Gameplay - Tsuki and Taiyo effectively makes up a third of your team, boosting its numbers to 6 rather than the normal 5. If this isn&rsquo;t team-oriented gameplay, I don&rsquo;t know what is. 10/10\n\tC: Foe Based Gameplay - This champion could be frustrating to 1v1, given it effectively becomes a 2v1 unless you have decided to split the dragons in order to have a greater impact on the game. It could be frustrating for enemies if you use a Q,R combo as an escape to get the entire way across the map. And I can see this as a possibility in competitive play. 6/10\n\tTotal: 22/30\n\n6: Phonos - Assassin of the Void - Fitzky\n\tA: Individual Gameplay - This seems like a fairly underdeveloped idea so far, but it looks fairly Individual oriented, given the assassin nature. 7/10\n\tB: Team Based Gameplay - I can&rsquo;t see any interaction with the rest of the team in this concept. That&rsquo;s disappointing. 0\n\tC: Foe Based Gameplay - With most assassins, it feels pretty bad to die against them. However, I feel like this assassin could be a different story. I feel like this guy would be a simple case of &quot;Oh, I got outplayed.&quot; 7/10\n\tTotal: 14/30\n\nEDIT: added clarity to the individual comments section.","replies":[]}
