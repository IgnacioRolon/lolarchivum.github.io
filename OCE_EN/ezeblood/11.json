Each entry must have detailed tooltips for abilities, base stats, growth stats, and a proposed gameplay outline. A backstory may be included if the author wishes, though it will hold no sway in the judging process. Entries must be entirely the author&#039;s own work, though can be submitted on behalf of another person, with appropriate credit being given along with the link. To enter, post a link to the boards post containing your entry in the comments below.\r\nAll right, let&#039;s get this month of OCCC underway!\r\n\r\nCurrent Entries:\r\n1.\r\n2.\r\n3.\r\n4.\r\n5.\r\n6.\r\n7.\r\n8.\r\n9.\r\n10.\r\n11.\r\n12.\r\n13.\r\n14.\r\n15.\r\n16.\r\n17.\r\n18.\r\n19.\r\n20.","replies":[{"poster":"EzeBlood","date":"2016-06-28T11:22:50.222+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Welp, that sucks.
