Entries will be limited to three per summoner name. Winners for last season will be up shortly, as soon as I am done with these Mid Course Exams. I am looking for people interested in helping out in grading concepts for this and future seasons. If you are interested, shoot me a friend request in game and we can sort something out.\nFor participants, if you don&#039;t remember the rules, they are:\n\n1. Each entry is judged on three categories: Individual, Team focused, and Enemy focused gameplay. Basically, is the champion fun to play as, with, and against?\n\n2. Entries are open from the 1st of the first month of each season, through to the 27th of the last month in each season.\n\n3. Winners are announced on the 2nd of the month after the end of each season (i.e. the day after entries open for the next season)\n\n4. Each entry must have detailed tooltips for abilities, base stats, growth stats, and a proposed gameplay outline.\n\n5. Entries must be entirely the author&#039;s own work, though can be submitted on behalf of another person, with appropriate credit being given along with the link. (No Plagiarism!)\n\nTo enter, put a link to the file or boards post in the comments.","replies":[{"poster":"EzeBlood","date":"2017-04-19T11:26:57.235+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Bump for those who missed it when this went up in March, we're now halfway through Autumn and still no entries D:","replies":[{"poster":"EzeBlood","date":"2017-04-30T11:29:34.341+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Now 2/3 of the way through this season, and still no entries.
