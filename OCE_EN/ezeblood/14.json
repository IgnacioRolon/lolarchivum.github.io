Or perhaps it&#039;ll change the origins of Aatrox entirely? At the moment, it&#039;s sort of shrouded by the mists of time, and as a Lore enthusiast, I would love to know what happened to the rest of the Darkin. Presently, Aatrox&#039;s lore states that there are 5 Darkin, 2 of which are known to the people of Runeterra: Aatrox, and another unnamed Darkin. Are all 5 of these Darkin the same Gods of War that Aatrox is, or do they all have different demonic attributes? Answers would be wonderful, but I understand if you can&#039;t express anything this early in the piece.","replies":[]}
