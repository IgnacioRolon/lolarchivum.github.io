Well, I figured that Christmas is an appropriate time to reboot the comp, and I&#039;ve decided to make the entry windows a lot larger. This time around, each competition will be open for one whole season (Summer, Autumn, Winter, Spring, not ranked season), to allow for a greater number of participants in each. Entries will be limited to three per summoner name. If you don&#039;t remember the rules, they are:\r\n&gt;1. Each entry is judged on three categories: Individual, Team focused, and Enemy focused gameplay. Basically, is the champion fun to play as, with, and against?\r\n\r\n&gt;2. Entries are open from the 1st of the first month of each season, through to the 27th of the last month in each season.\r\n\r\n&gt;3. Winners are announced on the 2nd of the month after the end of each season (i.e. the day after entries open for the next season)\r\n\r\n&gt;4. Each entry must have detailed tooltips for abilities, base stats, growth stats, and a proposed gameplay outline.\r\n\r\n&gt;5. Entries must be entirely the author&#039;s own work, though can be submitted on behalf of another person, with appropriate credit being given along with the link. (No Plagiarism!)\r\n\r\nTo enter, post a link to the file on the next post, which will be made on the evening of Wednesday, 30th November.\r\nIf you are interested in being involved in grading entries, comment on this post or shoot me a friend request in game and we can sort something out.","replies":[{"poster":"I Stealth I","date":"2016-11-28T10:47:14.572+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"If I have an idea, do I post it here or on a seperate discussion?","replies":[{"poster":"EzeBlood","date":"2016-12-02T03:47:10.334+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"you can post it [here](http://boards.oce.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/player-creations/9Owab26A-occc-summer-2016-17-entries), thanks!","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Talon12","date":"2016-11-27T10:19:03.953+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I enjoy reading champions people make and i usually grade them and help the person anyway, so I guess i can take a look at that","replies":[]},{"poster":"Olliynx","date":"2016-11-27T05:32:47.105+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Does the champion have to be posted in a discussion after the competition starts?
