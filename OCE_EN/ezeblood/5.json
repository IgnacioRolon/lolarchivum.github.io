Blood, screaming, darkness. A vine lies on the floor, coated with the russet sheen of blood. In the darkness, a fox scampers about. A moaning man can be heard, as a blue light shines in front of him. The fox glows too, morphing violently into a semi human being. Sparks fly, one of them landing on the vine, causing the vine to glow as well. Then all of a sudden, pitch black.\r\n\r\nBlinkingly, the humanoid figure opens its eyes, it hears the world for the first time, smells the fragrances of the plains North of the great border, and instinctively makes its way to the Institute of War. \r\n\r\nAppearance ~ Buff, male humanoid monster. Spines on it&rsquo;s back, body composed of intertwined vines in places (such as shoulders or other joints). Wears a leathery chestpiece and from the waist down is entirely tree roots. Sounds like Nocturne, but less hissing and deeper tone.\r\n\r\n\r\nABILITIES + STATS + PLAYSTYLE\r\n\r\nPassive - part 1: Thorny Hide: Each 10 ability power gives +(10 &divide; champion level) armour and magic resistance.\r\npart 2: Growth Rings: Every 30 seconds, Nashton gains a 25 health shield. This shield stacks, but time spent dead or channelling does not count towards the shield. If Nashton does channel or get killed, then the timer resets for that 30 seconds.\r\n\r\nQ - Thwack! : Nashton is rooted and absorbs damage for a short time. Upon recast or timeout, Nashton regains movement and deals damage in an area in front of him based on how much he absorbed. DOES NOT ABSORB TOWER DAMAGE. If no damage is taken, Nashton recovers 100/150/200/250/300 health.\r\n\r\nQ stats:\r\nchannel time: 2 seconds\r\ndamage absorbence: 20% physical + 50% magic\r\nrecast damage: 20% of damage absorbed, up to 150/175/200/225/250\r\nrecast AoE: 60 degrees, 100 units\r\nCooldown: 11/10/9/8/7 seconds (begins upon first cast)\r\nMana cost: 60/65/70/75/80\r\n\r\nW - Rich Soil: Nashton channels for 3 seconds, restoring 50/75/100/125/150 +30% AP health and mana per second. This spell is interrupted by any form of damage taken or crowd control effect (other than slows, unless the slow deals damage). Cannot be hit by item passives (Ravenous Hydra, Runaan&rsquo;s Hurricane, Liandri&rsquo;s Torment, etc.).\r\n\r\nW stats:\r\nchannel time: 3 seconds\r\nhealth restore: 50/75/100/125/150 +30% AP per second.\r\nmana restore: 50/75/100/125/150 +30% AP per second.\r\nCooldown: 21/20/19/18/17 seconds\r\nMana cost: 30 at all ranks\r\n\r\nE - Flora Torpedo: Dashes to location, dealing damage to and knocking aside any enemies hit along the way. Upon arrival, slows all enemies within a small radius.\r\n\r\nE stats:\r\ndamage: 50/75/100/125/150 +50% AP\r\ndash range: 500\r\nslow radius: 50\r\nCooldown: 14/13/12/11/10\r\nMana cost: 60/65/70/75/80\r\n\r\nR - Lash Out: Deals large amounts of hybrid damage to and knocks back enemies in a large radius around Nashton, to the edge of the radius. If enemies hit a wall or structure when knocked back, they are stunned for a duration.\r\n\r\nR stats:\r\ndamage: 150/200/250 +20% bonus health (physical damage) and 150/200/250 +80% AP (magic damage)\r\nrange: 400/500/600\r\nstun duration: 2 seconds at all ranks\r\nCooldown: 120/105/90\r\nMana cost: 125/100/100\r\n\r\nBase Stats ~\r\nAtkDmg - 45 (+6/level = 153 @ lv18)\r\nAtkRng - 560 (+0/level = 560 @ lv18)\r\nAP - 0 (+0/level = 0 @ lv18)\r\nMax HP - 368 (+68/level = 1592 @ lv18)\r\nMax MP - 270 (+42/level = 1026 @ lv18)\r\nAtkSpeed - 0.68 (+0.04/level = 1.40 @ lv18)\r\nHP Regen - 6 per 5 (+1 per 5/level = 24 per 5 @ lv18)\r\nMP Regen - 4 per 5 (+0.8 per 5/level = 18.4 per 5 @ lv18)\r\nMoveSpeed - 335 (+0/level = 335 @ lv18)\r\nAR - 48 (+6/level = 156 @ lv18)\r\nMR - 45 (+0/level = 45 @ lv18)\r\n\r\nPlaystyle ~ I have designed Nashton to be a tanky mage, heavily reliant upon his Q for damage. I think Nashton would be an excellent jungler, simply due to his amazing regeneration capability (from W) and extreme gank potential (E + R). It would also make Nashton a fairly unique champion in the league, with only a few AP tank junglers available: Nautilus, Warwick (AP WW is still viable, the heals and damage from the Q are amazing), Cho&rsquo;Gath, Maokai and Sejuani. I believe that Nashton would also be a viable mid-laner, due to his extremely high level scaling and ability to tank a ton of magic damage with his Q.\r\n\r\nA basic jungle path would be: Gromp (smite), Blue, Red, Raptors (smite), gank mid/bot (whichever needs it more). The Gromp buff allows Nashton to take blue with ease, especially when he uses Q to tank out the damage that the buff monster deals. Getting lv3 off Red buff allows you to regen your health and mana further, before taking out raptors for the truesight buff, allowing you to clear a path to gank. You can choose to take dragon at this point if you think you can take it, but I would not recommend it, due to your low early game damage output.","replies":[{"poster":"Maraudaur","date":"2016-09-14T06:30:44.708+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Cool concept, a couple of things to think about;\n\n1) why is this tree dude wearing leather?\n\n2) when I play as him how should I feel? (i.e. when I play Jinx i definitely feel her maniac personality, when I play Yasuo I feel like an agile swords master)\n\nI like the channeling aspects to make this character feel like he is rather entrenched but then his E makes him like a torpedo? His ult also doesn't seem to fit a tank role, it does a tonne of damage and is instant cast. Most ultimate's should really deliver on the power fantasy that the champion is trying to convey. i.e. Jinx's rocket, velkoz lazer, Zed ulti. What is the fantasy you are trying to achieve here and why is this specific ultimate the right one?\n\n3) in terms of lore, i see you've gone with the old institue route. Would be good for you to elaborate on what this character believes. Does he like war? what experiences have shaped his life? what does he like and what doesnt he like? why?\n\nThis will help you build out what it you may want the player to feel when they are playing as that champion.","replies":[{"poster":"EzeBlood","date":"2016-09-16T05:18:26.977+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Cheers Maraudaur, will certainly give it a bit more of a look in after I finish with these darned exams. 8 exams in 2 weeks and then interstate for the week following will not be the best for concept productivity, but you gotta have a life in the real world when you're still a school student.\nThis was actually something I wrote up a while back (before illaoi came out) and was really just resting on it for a while.
