I lagged out of the game and was unable to reconnect to the game. I checked my internet speeds etc and all was fine. How come this is possible to get disconnected from the server and count as a loss. Better yet i was on 40LP s1 and got demoted back to s2, and also leave buster for 5 games. This system is such a joke that it ruins your game play experience over what isn&#039;t our doing.\r\n\r\nPlease riot sort this out to make sure it doesn&#039;t Happen again, loss of LP and leave buster is really annoying if it wasn&#039;t even our fault. This shouldn&#039;t even happen to the good people and yet people out there get away with it who aren&#039;t as friendly.","replies":[{"poster":"HORSE OF FORCE","date":"2015-06-04T10:57:10.048+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Disconnections can be the fault of the servers, but it could also be the fault of something in your route to connecting *too* the servers. Not all ISPs are equal, and some redirect your traffic through other miscellaneous servers before actually getting you to the one you want. Sometimes this is beneficial, as those servers will boost your speed versus connecting directly. Most of the time, it does not, and if just one of those servers fail then you could experience disconnection issues (and due to the nature of the internet, even if it's just a split-second disconnection, it could cause your computer to not be able to retrieve its connection to the server).\n\nIf you find yourself being disconnected from games regularly then you are suggested to stick to testing in Customs until you have it fixed. What ISP are you with, and what OS are you on?","replies":[]},{"poster":"I Do nt KnW Y","date":"2015-06-04T04:31:42.032+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Same happened to me...
