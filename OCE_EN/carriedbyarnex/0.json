I was on a 18 or so win streak in ranked and had climbed back up to silver 2 after being in b1 from placements. Now my issue is not that i was placed in bronze 1 at all. as you can see if you aren&#039;t meant to be in the division you will climb, but i just had my first loss and it was due to an unsettling circumstance. In my promo for silver 2 i was placed with somebody who had NEVER played ranked, i&#039;m not talking about &quot;had good mmr&quot; no just never played ranked. He proceeded to not understand how to gank or jungle and that&#039;s fine for a new player i get it but my question is why am i being placed with him? especially on an almost 20 game win streak in my promos? is that just bad matchmaking or is there something that i&#039;m missing?\r\n\r\nNot meaning to come across rude just confused as to why we would be paired as it&#039;s just as unfair for that to be his first game as it is for him to be in my sil 2 promos.\r\nCheers :){{item:3070}} {{item:3070}} {{summoner:3}} {{sticker:zombie-nunu-bummed}}","replies":[{"poster":"Ing√©nue","date":"2016-04-22T01:03:25.131+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"New ranked players have the same MMR as (low) silver players. That way, the ones that are good and have stayed away from ranked while they tuned their skill don't have to claw their way out of bronze off the get-go. \n\nIt happened to me a couple of games ago in one of my series as well, but luckily it doesn't happen too much.","replies":[{"poster":"CarriedByArnex","date":"2016-04-22T03:35:32.012+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thanks for the response :)","replies":[]}]}]}
