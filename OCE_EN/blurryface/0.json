So me and a friend noticed a couple days ago that we were able to refund items in the shop even though we had ALREADY used our 3 allocated refunds, long ago. It is obviously limited to time, as the other day there were 3 items that had the refund button next to them but checking now only 1 of the three items is refundable and it was the one i tested with the other day (i refunded it then bought it back). The items that i could refund were 2 skins that were on sale- ninja rammus and Kennen M.D.- and the championship ward skin. I had only purchased one skin since purchasing those 2- Championship Kalista- and i am unable to refund her. Also as i refunded the item, my game crashed but it successfully went through with the refund and i was able to get my RP back. I&#039;m not sure if this is some change riot put in place or if its an actual bug. I have sent a message to riot support and they suggested i post here with information about it. I sent a screenshot with the ticket. I can share it here but not sure if its a good idea publicly sharing my purchase history. If you need more info i can provide it but i hope this is detailed enough.","replies":[]}
