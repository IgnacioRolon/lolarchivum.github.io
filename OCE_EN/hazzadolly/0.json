I want to have a ranked account and a non-ranked). Champion select was normal. Everyone but one guy called who just locked in his choice (lee sin jungle), and the person who called jungle went support Morgana. I was playing Tristana adc. We got into game and I immediately noticed that everyone on the enemy team, other than Miss Fortune, had keystone masteries. Myself and lux were the people on my team without one. The game started off ok but their Zed was definitely much better than our Lux (sorry Lux). He completely destroyed her in lane and had a ton more cs than her. Then he began roaming everywhere, our morgana went afk and we ended up losing. After the game i check zed&#039;s profile and found out that he was SILVER FIVE. Really? A bunch of low level people who just want to play the game and have fun against a SILVER FIVE? i know that it is not a high rank but to be matched up with him when he had full runes and masteries was very unfair. I had just had a game before with a Xin Xhao jungle on the enemy team who was a smurf and flamed us the whole game for being bad/trash/should unistall etc. \r\n\r\nI was wondering if anyone in the community had any similar games. I&#039;m sorry if this is a bit ranty and not appropriate for this board but it is what riot support suggested.{{item:3070}} {{item:3070}} {{item:3070}}","replies":[{"poster":"JasonWazza","date":"2015-12-20T05:17:46.174+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Unfortunately this is just what happens when people duo with low level accounts, it's unlucky but unfortunately you just have to take it in your stride.\n\nThe zed is in a 4 man premade with a bunch of lower level accounts, and matchmaking kinda just straight up fucks up unless it can match them properly.","replies":[{"poster":"hazzadolly","date":"2015-12-20T05:23:35.665+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yeah :( how can you tell if he is in a premade? also thanks for the comment :)","replies":[{"poster":"JasonWazza","date":"2015-12-20T05:27:22.313+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"went to his OP.GG, noticed he was in the game with the same 4 people several times in a row.\n\nfact is a silver 5 doesn't just randomly get placed in those games.","replies":[{"poster":"Talon12","date":"2015-12-20T09:15:59.565+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"unless he is that bad riot classes him as a level 17","replies":[]},{"poster":"hazzadolly","date":"2015-12-20T05:28:07.815+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"ok thanks bro :)","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"lil dang","date":"2015-12-20T10:56:17.862+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I had this issue once, I lost 10 GAMES IN A ROW!","replies":[]},{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2015-12-20T08:12:02.219+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Because of our server's population and the relative rarity of it happening, matchmaking has a lot of trouble with large premades with a massive mmr diff. If youa re in a premade of four then you are pretty much always going to get matched against a premade of four, and this limits what the system can to do balance teams. I played a game, my team was three plats, a gold and me (unranked at the time but with gold-ish normal mmr), so our average mmr was maybe Gold 2/3~. The enemy team, was four bronzes and one challenger (the challenger was queued with them). Of course their average mmr was likely similar to ours, but the sheer skill difference meant it was a real mess of a game. We actually one, mostly because while the challenger Lee had 20~ kills, the rest of his team had about 10+~ deaths each and only a few kills between them.\n\nMatchmaking also gets iffy when smurfs are involved, because it's sometimes difficult for the system to determine where their actual skill is, and I don't believe it accounts for things like runes and masteries so things get skewed there. You got real unlucky, I can only say that it will probably get better once you actually hit 30 on that account. But good luck nonetheless :)","replies":[]},{"poster":"Talon12","date":"2015-12-20T09:17:24.787+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"DON'T SMURF, ITS AGAINST RITO RULES","replies":[{"poster":"JasonWazza","date":"2015-12-20T11:19:29.044+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"smurfing isn't against the rules, botting accounts to level 30 is against rito's rules, as long as you own the account personally and play the games it plays, it's not against a rule.","replies":[]},{"poster":"lil dang","date":"2015-12-20T10:56:46.149+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Since when","replies":[{"poster":"Talon12","date":"2015-12-20T13:43:09.303+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"since the \"additional accounts makes it harder for new players to join the game and makes the player base harder to expand, don't do it\" rule","replies":[{"poster":"lil dang","date":"2015-12-26T14:38:43.733+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"OK","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}
