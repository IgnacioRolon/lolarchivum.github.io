Why do they get so much negative spotlight in the news program? Why not cover the largest terrorists demographics such as Latino gangsters, some very \"active\" political minorities or separatists?\n\nNot to mention, if you think some radical rouge Islamic extremists killing a few hundreds is bad, what about Hitler, Bush, the good o' European \"explorers\" and guys who ordered the atomic bomb strike? Do those people seriously think muslims are truly the cancer of this world?\n\n{{sticker:zombie-brand-clap}} \n\nYou made people apes, and I hate you for it, mass media. I also hate you, the people who don't look outside the window and just sit there getting spoon fed with twisted facts and lies.","replies":[]}
