And it would seem that voice-over and written language are bound together so you can't seem to change one without affecting the other.\n\nOh well...... \n\nI just hope there are options and ways to really only change the VO, as I really don't want to get into the file shuffling and mods businesses that other people seem to be doing.

Because language is region-bound with the sole exceptions being some of them in the EU that a region could have multiple languages in stock. But here it's default to be English, and there doesn't seem to be other language options for it.\n\nUnless you're right and I'm wrong, which in that case please show me how it's done.","replies":[]}]}]}
