Because I had never used the Youtube comment sections, or Youtube as a whole beyond reading and watching what it has to offer.\n\nYet, after a mere 3 days of Youtube commenting activities, I realise that I am now a ghost member whose comments can only be seen by myself. \n\nSomeone must have flagged me for either discussing stuff in anime videos (primarily Hunter x Hunter), or compiling song lists of those 1 Hour anime music videos where the uploaders don&#039;t even bother to themselves. I mean all this deserves a spam tag?\n\nDang man, Youtube. I know it's impossible to check each and every comment but this system is ridiculous don't you think?\n\n{{sticker:zombie-brand-facepalm}}\n\nI am not sure if the tag is channel specific or account specific though, I just hope it's not the latter at the very least.","replies":[]}
