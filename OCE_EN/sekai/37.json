I hope it isn't you) failed to update the details with League, leading to errors, if my poor interpretation hasn't gotten in my way this time.\r\n\r\nThe problem I have is though, that is for EUW, is the Google's DNS here the same as the one used in EUW? I don't wanna randomly update my DNS to some random service I don't even know.","replies":[{"poster":"Klavinmour","date":"2015-01-14T02:36:01.224+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I see people complaining about RADS almost everytime I look at the boards, yet not a single damn person explains what it is.\n\nWhat the hell is it?","replies":[{"poster":"SEKAI","date":"2015-01-14T02:41:17.533+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Not sure, I looked at it briefly from some places it seems it's a case where the client can not find the League server even though the internet is in top condition.\n\nI think Riot updated some of their routing details and some internet servers haven't updated the routing causing an error when client was trying to reach that new location which it causes a conflict on the internet server. That's why a fix is to change which internet server you're trying to reach, change into the one that has the updated details.\n\nOr something like that, I don't know to be perfectly honest.
