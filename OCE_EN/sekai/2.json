But I have pretty much been forced to play as support (who is all control) these days as most champs who have that theme are deemed simply unfair or OP by me.\n\nHowever I personally do not find Yasuo that way even though I have a long standing history of CT hate, I had only found his passive shield to be broken but it has since been fixed, prompting me to try him out but it clashes with my principles (CertainlyT....).\n\nNo sure what to do.","replies":[{"poster":"Gravelord","date":"2015-10-04T09:33:32.001+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I understand the hatred for CertainlyT.
