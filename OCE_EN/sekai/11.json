But they've all happened in Ranked, as in, they are usually all within the same game.\n\nIt's not like I'm better, I mean, I'm in Silver5 for a reason. But I at least get arguably better teammates to work with in Normals (since everything counts when you're bad).... which is just odd, because that shouldn't have been the case really.\n\nOh well.","replies":[{"poster":"CHEESYLEEKS","date":"2017-01-24T08:34:56.666+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Are you new?","replies":[{"poster":"SEKAI","date":"2017-01-24T09:03:05.612+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=CHEESYLEEKS,realm=OCE,application-id=FjGAIbRv,discussion-id=v70mekPG,comment-id=0000,timestamp=2017-01-24T08:34:56.666+0000)\n>\n> Are you new?\n\nNew to Ranked I suppose. I never quite played Ranked despite playing League for like 4 years or something.","replies":[{"poster":"Nightjar","date":"2017-01-24T10:39:37.495+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"you need to get just a little higher to around silver 3-4, the difference in skill isn't really noticeable, but the people you meet are much better and you'll see alot more teamwork, rotations, map awareness, tp ganks, ect. People aren't necessarily better, but they're alot more contentious of their team and not just tunnel visioned on their own champion.\n\nYes this elo isn't amazing or impressive, but I consider it a refuge where people who like this game and are nice, but not necessarily good at the game, can just stay and have fun. You also see alot less people here complaining about stuff or not getting jungle help, ect... You'll see encouragement, recognition of a good play from friend and foe alike and friendly banter in chat and you'll have a pretty good time chatting with both your own and the enemy team, whenever a number of you are stuck in deathtimers after a particularly chaotic teamfight.\n\nSilver 5 tends to be a bit uptight since everyone there is afraid because they are on the cusp of bronze, but once you gain a bit of breathing room, most people in silver tend to be pretty nice, at least until you start getting near gold, in which case people start getting really stressed about the game and just can't chill and be pleasant.\n\n... rip I really need to do well in my placements this season to get back there, because I don't think I'll survive getting chewed out by the bronze elo. I'll probably just tilt every game or fail to be impactful enough and end up being stuck there for eternity.","replies":[{"poster":"SEKAI","date":"2017-01-24T10:56:05.817+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Nightjar,realm=OCE,application-id=FjGAIbRv,discussion-id=v70mekPG,comment-id=000000000000,timestamp=2017-01-24T10:39:37.495+0000)\n>\n> [stuff..]\n\nThanks for the elaboration man, definitely appreciate you going through explaining the situation as detailed as you did.\n\nI suppose I'll try getting there as well (though not having too much faith in myself lol).\n\n> ... rip I really need to do well in my placements this season to get back there, because I don't think I'll survive getting chewed out by the bronze elo.\n\nNo worries bud, you can do it.","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Main Line","date":"2017-01-25T06:36:34.734+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=SEKAI,realm=OCE,application-id=FjGAIbRv,discussion-id=v70mekPG,comment-id=,timestamp=2017-01-24T05:30:43.013+0000)\n>\n> Feels weird man, why is it that?\n> \n\nNot really, its been that way since Season 4 for low elo. Idiots focus too much on how much LP they are gonna win/lose, instead what to do to win the game.","replies":[]}]}
