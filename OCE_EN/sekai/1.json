I am sorry, I didn't lose the game to you, I lost my lane earlier because Shaco's gank is simply superior so I had to worry about him for the entire duration of the early game letting you get bigger, ultimately driving me out of my lane. Our other lane picks are simply inferior to yours. I can not understand this logic of yours because there is none.\n\nWhy are you telling me to keep staying in lane pushing while Fizz and Blitz are dive killing everybody else in other lanes with 1 shot, and Shaco taking all other objectives whenever they're up? Why are you telling me to completely abandon other lanes so I can single push and get ganked by 5 man after they finish up other 2 lanes maybe? Why are you telling me to keep farming against you when you clearly have a numerical advantage due to early game? Why do you think you should educate me about how to play Nasus when all you do is afk farming and get carried by a superior team comp?\n\nOh yes I am butthurt because of mirror lanes, because how you asked me \"Nasus how many stacks\" when your team was steam rolling, because how you think you should give me a lecture on how to play a low skill capped champ with barely any skill in his kit other than trying to get a statistic upper-hand over the opponent and because how you think you Won the fking game by playing in single player mode for the entire duration.\n\nAlso you didn't win the game because you drew the game out, no. You guys had drawn the game out because you guys sucked, you had already won the game by 15 min mark but you couldn't finish it, dragging to 44 min.\n\nI would gladly go and try to control the other 4 members of your team leaving you last to deal with instead of the other way around thank you very much, there are more chances to win that way. I am pretty sure you don't win every single game as Nasus by doing nothing and just farm Q and stay in one lane. \n\nWhen things are unfavourable compromises have to be made it's just how it works, and in this case I believe I made the right decision by going tank route instead of the split pushing hyper carry. But unfortunately it was not enough to cover the gap.\n\n**TLDR: I hate mirror lanes, you can get some randoms who thinks he is better because in this game he performed better for whatever reason. And a superior comp from one team to another only makes it worse.**\n\n/rant\n\n\n\nForgive me, it's been some time since the last time I have been This hateful.","replies":[{"poster":"Klavinmour","date":"2014-12-06T22:39:27.885+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I just hate seeing two of the same champ in the one match.
