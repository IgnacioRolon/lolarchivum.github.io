Let me tell you why,\n\nEvery single sip reminds me of the toothpaste I use every morning, yes you heard right, pouring this thing down your throat is just like drinking toothpastes.\n\nEWWWWWWWWWWWWWW!!!!!\n\nI know it&#039;s because it has mint in there, but oh god, I am positive that they don&#039;t know the difference between genuine mint or toothpaste flavour.\n\nIt has to be the case where their \"beta testers\" drank too much flavours in his line of work, so much his tongue mutated into the next level of evolution beyond human comprehension. Yes, it has to be that, I can not understand why this is even a thing on the market. Why?\n\nI shall repeat one last time, do not attempt consuming this thing called Lipton Virgin Mojito Ice Tea.
