Being free doesn't excuse something from disappointment and/or criticism.\n\nWhen out of 3 rolls, 2 were utterly useless and 1 was just okay, I am allowed to express some disappointment, even if the said rolls in question are 'free' to begin with (it's actually not entirely free, because we're still paying time to get them).","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"CHEESYLEEKS","date":"2017-02-05T21:23:09.520+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"3 chests? thats no spree\n\ntry 20.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Niji","date":"2017-02-05T18:17:12.027+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"RIP\n\nYeah you shouldnt really bet on chests to give you good things but sometimes you do get lucky.
