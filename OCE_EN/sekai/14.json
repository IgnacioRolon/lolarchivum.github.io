Newer champions are rarely played, and most of them are just outright absent. And the vast majority of people seem to stick to older and more vintage champions who were released prior to 2014 with Yasuo being the most recent champion that I see in my matches consistently (excluding Camille, who&#039;s still enjoying her release-goldrush). Besides Camille, every champion released after Yasuo either appear to me as some kind of \"one-off\" or that they just don't appear whatsoever. This also more or less applies to newly reworked champions as well.\n2. Champion diversity seems to be very low, so low in fact if I don&#039;t know any better I&#039;d think that this game has 60-70 champions AT MOST, when in reality we have 133 at the moment. And unlike before where you often see people playing lesser-seen champions in normals and doing whatever off-beat/off-meta fashion of playing them, most games I&#039;ve played so far ever since my return has been very &quot;standard-ised&quot; in a way that &quot;oh yeah that&#039;s totally the champ that&#039;s gonna do X, and oh hey, I&#039;m right&quot;.\n\nHence as a whole, my experience since I&#039;ve come back to the game feels like somehow I&#039;ve been teleported back to the 2014 and playing the older and slightly alternative version of the game rather than fast-forward from late 2015 (when I took the break) to late 2016. The only aspects that legitimately remind me of that &quot;oh hey it&#039;s 2016 now (and going into 2017 as we speak)&quot; are the more nuanced subjects such as mastery, items and jungle changes. Otherwise speaking from the champions I see in my matches alone, it feels like I&#039;m stuck in some kind of strange time-loop that'd funneled me into an parallel-past where the team-comps were way more inflexible or something which is really just weird.\n\nBut idk, I have no idea whether or not my observations are valid and if so, what had happen during my break. Hence if anyone wanna shed some light on that, it'd be great.","replies":[{"poster":"Lord Sesshomaru","date":"2016-12-26T03:21:37.022+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thats about right.\n\nDiversity is a huge issue atm (but one that the right people don't see as a problem.)\nYasuo has a pick rate that puts him in legitimately 1/3rd of all games, rivalled closely by Lee Sin, Vayne, Jhin (the only new champ that is played), and Thresh. Zed also makes as much of an appearance as Pikachu does in Pokemon. \n\nI think the issue is that Riot are releasing new champions that are super strong, but also have mega weaknesses (inside Sol's stars, Kled's mini form, etc etc.) Which is great for counterplay and overall health of the game! BUT they are just quite frankly harder than many of the old champs that don't have super clear weaknesses (e.g. Zed/Yasuo) \n\nSo much of the population don't bother to learn them, and just seem to opt for the safe option. \n\nWorlds this year had a champion pool of around 20 champs. Bronze has a pool of even less champs (or at least it feels that way). \nIts genuinely stagnating the game. \n\nThats my 2 cents at least \n\nMy mains are Azir, Aurelion Sol, Taliyah, and Kalista, Kindred, Yorick, Ivern, so at least I do my part in-game for diversity, but I've pretty much given up campaigning in the name of diversity now. Ive accepted that ill be VS Zed/Yasuo/Lee for the rest of my life, so now I'm just watching youtube and trying to get better against them. \n\nIn any case, welcome back to league ^^ \nthere are a few bad things of course, but theres a fair number of good changes too :)","replies":[{"poster":"FerrousOxide","date":"2016-12-26T06:51:05.147+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Just gotta ask/add, I think its because lee sin zed and yas are all very safe picks and AD assassin type don't need to think about their builds. Also the fact  that they don't use mana so bronze players who don't like being punished for spamming ability's gravitate towards them. (On that note fuck sake riot give me mana pots or clarity back.)","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"CHEESYLEEKS","date":"2016-12-26T05:09:33.385+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"its because everyone seems to be trying so hard to win instead of just playing and enjoying the game on a champion you like and have fun on,win or lose.\n\nat best  i see {{champion:92}} {{champion:67}} {{champion:157}} {{champion:81}} {{champion:55}} in way to many games.\n\npeople just jump on the bandwagon with whats winning or what faker or other pros play.","replies":[]},{"poster":"TheOneUser","date":"2016-12-26T09:10:22.015+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"That's two of the many reasons why I play aram","replies":[]},{"poster":"jomoko2012","date":"2016-12-26T07:40:41.388+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Champs released after Yasuo that are played: Velkoz, Braum, Gnar, Ekko, Illaoi, Jhin and Ivern","replies":[{"poster":"SEKAI","date":"2016-12-26T07:42:45.218+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=jomoko2012,realm=OCE,application-id=Ntey9fRZ,discussion-id=XYsGnmvp,comment-id=0003,timestamp=2016-12-26T07:40:41.388+0000)\n>\n> Champs released after Yasuo that are played: Velkoz, Braum, Gnar, Ekko, Illaoi, Jhin and Ivern\n\nIf that's so for you then wonderful.\n\nI've only seen Illaoi, Jhin and Ivern like twice each, rest are completely absent for me, however, which isn't too good.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Valor Carrys","date":"2016-12-26T06:55:29.455+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yeah let's not take into account the time of year, it's the holidays, fact is we have a lot of players on that will not know the newer champions outside of camille, and at times won't have even bought champions like Ivern.\n\nNot to mention there is a meta, you say you have just come back and are experiencing a small Champion pool, but that is true of any specific patch in league, there are always stronger picks and weaker ones.\n\nA lot of the more casual base that is online more now is going to just go with champions they know.","replies":[]}]}
