{"poster":"SEKAI","date":"2015-05-11T04:04:58.072+0000","title":"So I accidentally got myself into a fight on NA Board but what fascinates me is that,","subforum":"Miscellaneous","up_votes":1,"down_votes":4,"body":"There seems to be a somewhat large gap between how I was brought up and how general US people would think,\n\nThere was this post on NA, note, **it was a comedy post** illustrating one of that OP&#039;s real life experience.\n\n> There was **A ** who was spacing off in class and went off browsing Azir&#039;s champ profile, the person **B**  (who was the OP) noticed that **A **wasn&#039;t paying attention in class and sneak to him to whisper a word \"Shurima\" next to his ear which caused him to fall off the chair and cause a scene which every student in the class room laughed. \n\nWhen I questioned that why he did this in a somewhat overreacting fashion, granted it wasn't a smart thing to do but since I have a soft spot for someone screwing another over just to make a clown out of him for his own satisfaction (which to me is borderline unacceptable to begin with but I digress) I just can't help it. He simply replied \"he was laughing with us wtf\".\n\nThat&#039;s where I truly started to despise OP because not only he wasn&#039;t paying attention to the class as well just like the dude he was ridiculing, he went off playing judges for his own selfish fulfillment and after making fun of somebody he outright refused to take responsibility/consequences or at least simply acknowledging that it was his doing but instead tossing onto the victim saying \"yeah he was fine with it so I&#039;m cool\".\n\nThat is pure hypocritical AND irresponsible to me.\n\nAnd my posts were met with extremely negative feedbacks because apparently for US, it&#039;s a completely fine thing to do, it&#039;s completely natural, there is nothing wrong with OP and they all think I am a humourless old fashioned unemployed bum who lives in the basement while browsing forums all day or something.\n\nTo their credit the second half of the statement is kind of true but still,\n\nI don&#039;t understand, I just don&#039;t. I can never laugh at this incident like how we are supposed to, especially when I know the full picture of it.\n\n/daily rant\n\n~~Moral of the story: Culture difference/barrier is still alive and kicking I guess. Tbh it's not all that surprising aye. ~~ Or maybe I should consider the fact that I am really a humourless idiot.\n\nEDIT: Scratch that, it's not cultural barrier since I just realised that he is also from OCE. Now it's just weird now kek.\n","replies":[{"poster":"FearTheVortex","date":"2015-05-11T06:19:24.123+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Sekai actually means 'The World' or 'The Earth' in Japanese and that must be the same size as your ego.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Wumachine","date":"2015-05-11T06:03:22.600+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"http://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/miscellaneous/s4TBhX5d-so-i-trolled-a-guy-by-shouting-shurima?comment=000d\n\nIt was my post, sekai is just a little bitch who can't take a joke, he also twisted my story to make me out as the bad guy, lmfao","replies":[{"poster":"SEKAI","date":"2015-05-11T06:09:03.150+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Wumachine,realm=OCE,application-id=Ntey9fRZ,discussion-id=jYpFtd7k,comment-id=0003,timestamp=2015-05-11T06:03:22.600+0000)\n>\n> http://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/miscellaneous/s4TBhX5d-so-i-trolled-a-guy-by-shouting-shurima?comment=000d\n> \n> It was my post, sekai is just a little bitch who can't take a joke, he also twisted my story to make me out as the bad guy, lmfao\n\nI didn't realise you're actually from OCE, then it makes it even weirder since I originally thought it was cultural differences.\n\nOh man, what a total mess this entire affair is now.\n\nI illustrated the story exactly how you described, with my thoughts attached afterwards, pretty sure it's how we do things.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"kJs","date":"2015-05-11T04:19:17.756+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I don't see the problem.
