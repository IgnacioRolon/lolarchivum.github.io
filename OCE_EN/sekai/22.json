{"poster":"SEKAI","date":"2018-07-11T07:18:26.683+0000","title":"Fuck this shit","subforum":"GD","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"I have less than 1 day left on the VS event, and it just suddenly decides to, after the a match, to reset itself back to the initial &quot;choose your side&quot; page and deletes all my in-progress missions, of which the page I can not advance and is permanently stuck.\n\nI have less than 1 day, and it has to give me this completely illogical bug. How does this bug even cocking happen?\n\nSo I guess I have to kiss goodbye to my VS event reward? I mean, the support ticket will take at least 1 day to even respond, and even when they put it back to where it was, I still have to complete the quests, so it&#039;s impossible to make it in time.\n\nWhich is funny, my account has been bugged for eons and I have not advanced a SINGLE CHECKPOINT in Honour despite the season is ALREADY ENDING, and so I've since resigned to the fate of being unable to obtain the end-of-season award. And now I have to put up with this shit.\n\n#THANKS, RIOT\n\nFor fuck&#039;s sake. Seriously. For fucking fucks sake.\n\nEDIT: Apparently, there are other people having the same bug as I do, in another server. Did Riot set the dead-line wrong? Who knows.","replies":[]}
