I mean, let&#039;s just say he, his &quot;fans&quot; and his &quot;fanfare&quot; are for the very most part, just bullshiet and we all know it; however I shall spare you lot from going through the list.\n\nBecause that isn&#039;t the problem.\n\nWhat&#039;s a problem though, is that I automatically tilt whenever his mug face shows up on my screen. My rage would overcome me, and I couldn&#039;t play properly for once against this guy. And it thus becomes a vicious cycle: I hate this guy, I tilt when I see him, I play badly and maybe got owned by him, and so I hate him some more.\n\nSo I ask: How do deal with this rage? How do I utilise this rage to defeat him rather than defeating myself before the confrontation even takes place? What should I do to distance myself from all the nonsense this guys has, or had, and just focus on playing against them like any other champion in this game who may or may not be objectively/fundamentally broken?\n\nFor the longest time, I have tried to contain it, but it doesn't work.\n\nIt doesn't have to be Lee Sin, any advice from dealing with your personal nemesis would do. Please teach me.","replies":[{"poster":"Lord Sesshomaru","date":"2017-01-21T23:07:40.730+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"Channel your hate young Skywalker! It makes you strong! \n\nHow I deal with my nemesis (Yasuo/Zed) is that I don't try to. \nUsually a lane is about trades and trying to kill your opponent. I blatantly don't even try to take them. I spend 100% of my effort purely on surviving.\nSure I lose minions, and miss opportunities, but the people who play Zed/Yasuo, are people who play this game only for kills, and they are usually the type of people who get so salty when they cant get them. \n\nSo deny them kills long enough, and eventually they take stupid risks to try and kill you. _(Usually they succeed of course because they are Zed/Yasuo)_ but every now and then you get lucky and kill them :P\n\nIm not sure how that translates to VSing Lee Sin. But instead of trying to counter play him in fights, just try to deny him everything a Lee Sin player likes doing. Use your hatred to take pleasure in making his life hell.\nLee Sin's love counter jungling. So just make life miserablefor him if he tries, sit and wait for him with a friend. Or bait him into a counter jungle while you go and gank one of his lanes, make him regret it. Lee loves early ganks, just buy all the wards/trinkets you can, and ward the shit out of the river, set traps, make his early life absolutely hell. \n\nIt will set you back for sure, but it'll also set him back, and tilt him so hard. \n\nThe problem I have with Lee Sin, is his movement speed. He has so much in-fight mobility, and can ward jump over walls, his Q has almost no CD either, so why give one of the most mobile champs, the single highest base movement speed in the game? I just don't understand.  When a champ like Kindred _(who's whole kit requires her to get around the map to her marks faster than her opponent)_, has the slowest movement speed? \n\n________\n\n**To put it in perspective:** Lee Sin has a higher movement speed than Hecarim...\nI find it hard to believe that a blind man, runs through the jungle faster than a sighted guy with a horse for legs. xD\n\nChannel your hatred, become Vader, destroy your enemies!","replies":[{"poster":"Neosinf","date":"2017-01-22T03:06:38.441+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Lord Sesshomaru,realm=OCE,application-id=Ntey9fRZ,discussion-id=UdaNj4Tm,comment-id=0001,timestamp=2017-01-21T23:07:40.730+0000)\n>\n> Channel your hate young Skywalker!

This thread is just a rage-fuelled whinge-fest but your post was light, entertaining and full of wisdom for readers.\n\nThe most popular skill-set type is burst+mobility. \n\nEzreal, Lee sin, Leblanc, Yasuo, Zed. They all initiate from range, easily perform their combos and then have enough mobility to escape or chase down. Players find this combination to be highly preferable as it removes the inherent risk of fully engaging on an opponent. Only way to balance this combination is to change the champions (Elise, Azir, Khaz, Nid) and remove it, but then Riot will lose a large player base, with the revenue.\n\nSo expect such shenagins to continue.","replies":[{"poster":"SEKAI","date":"2017-01-22T10:54:59.182+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Neosinf,realm=OCE,application-id=Ntey9fRZ,discussion-id=UdaNj4Tm,comment-id=00010001,timestamp=2017-01-22T03:06:38.441+0000)\n>\n> I thoroughly enjoyed reading your post.

For lee sin it might help to watch a leesin stream or youtuber like Bubba Kush and get to know his jungle route, the size and speed of his hitboxes and where he intends to make plays, maybe even try to play the champion yourself a few times.

It doesn't matter if he's a champion that \"takes skill\" the only people who play him are either level 5 or level 7 one tricks that ward jump from behind a wall and ult you into your lane opponent sending you to your death.

Too much safety, power (somewhat) and flexibility in 1 package, and not enough innate and set-in-stone open weaknesses for the opponent to exploit and take advantage of. You either overpower him with OP stat-checks, overwhelm him with extra commitment and focus (which can work against Lee, or anybody, and the enemy team still has 4 other players), or you just pray that he's an idiot. That's not really a healthy interaction.\n\nAll of the champions who are designed with similar philosophies as him share this same problem. I have the most issues with Lee personally though, because I've seen his face a bit too much. But that's just me.\n\nAlso the \"denial\" method doesn't really work, at least not now. Why? Because:\n\n1. These days, people just gangbang you under your own tower.\n2. Lee is an initiator and one among the best chaser in the entire game. So even if you don't want to see Lee and avoid him like a plague, he will still go out of his way to catch you.\n3. You will be denied CS so hard if you play passively throughout the entire early game you will most likely just lose in the end anyway.\n4. Lee doesn't actually \"fall off\" in the grand scheme of things, Shaco and Pantheon fall off, Lee's \"fall off\" is rather minimal in comparison to them.\n\nBut idk.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Anıma","date":"2017-01-21T09:19:16.092+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"ban it","replies":[]},{"poster":"Main Line","date":"2017-01-31T10:23:22.325+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Be happy that most Lee Sins lower than Diamond are just feeders.
