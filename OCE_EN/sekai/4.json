Forgive me.**\n\nAs Pantheon, I went 8/0/2 right off the bat, killed the living hell out of my lane (mid) and the other (bot), I also killed the enemy jungler occasionally, and other things.\n\nSo far so good.\n\nAnd my team started dying, they started rushing into the middle of enemy team solo, they started doing god knows what and they just kept dying.\n\nWhat's infuriating was that for some reason, the enemy MF, who has been dying throughout the game, manages to team-wipe us in a team-fight by pressing R only and all of us instantly died. When I checked my death-cam, guess what, I was stuck by 1 wave of it, and it gave me 1010 damage upfront!\n\nEventually we lost because we were never really fighting together more than a group of 3 as there was always another couple on death timer while the still living ones would charge and suicide for some reasons and cycle repeats until our nexus via a overwhelming 5-man \"for\" surrender vote. In the end-game chat I mentioned, though in a frustrated but civil tone how it's frustrating to lose a game after going 8/0/2 and their response was \"git gud\".\n\nClearly an intelligent remark.\n\nI go on mentioning that MF's ulti is situationally broken because I was downed without as much as blinking and the thing's range is insane of its potential damage and the fact there is 0 telegraph at all, guess what they said? \"Get better at dodging, you just suck\". And they leave the end-game chat the **instant** after posting that shit.\n\nFARK YOU, seriously.\n\n.........................\n\nIt can't be my fault to assume some semblance of civility and grace from fellow players, can't it?

Maybe they had buffs (I think they did end up netting Baron if I recall correctly). Maybe it's just random a glitch on the kill-feed. Or maybe I thought I was only hit by the wave once even though I actually got hit more than that due to say an error on my visual. Etc.\n\nStill, I do know what I read, 1010 damage from her ulti on the kill-feed, which was written as the only source of damage from her in that fight. Though I don't have screenshot, and I doubt you'll believe it purely based on anecdotal evidence given your stance, however I'm just saying that I wasn't lying about the number I saw. I mean really, everything could be back-traced these days, nor is my post addressed to anybody to begin with (I even tell you that it's just a rant and everybody should avoid in the title); and even just logically, there are not much incentive to lie over a number due to how easily they could be disproven.\n\nAnd when I said \"most infuriating\", I wasn't stating \"fking OP\", I merely stated so as a \"Oh what really?\" I only brought it up in the game to the enemy team by basing it off the facts that I saw \"1010\" from a single ulti and from a mostly un-fed ADC (at the time) in my kill feed, that I didn't seem to be hit by it much from my perspective at the time, and that the damage is probably too good for an ability that does have a huge range and doesn't have a telegraph. And even then I remained relatively civil and only called it \"situationally broken\" because I at least knew it must have been a combination of certain factors that somehow drove the number that high, even though I don't know which are the said factors (as I don't play MF). You could point out some stated details if they don't add up and all that, and clarifications/corrects are welcomed, but flat out calling another a liar just because there's something that doesn't seem to match up is needlessly aggressive. \n\nThe main focus of the rant was simply about losing the game from a massive lead I worked for, feeling bad about it, and then being poured cold water by the enemy team, which caused me to lose my cool for a whatever reason (refer to the talk I had with Seras Dragon). And it's really just that.\n\nIf you're going to make a counter-argument of some sort, at least don't use some cheap tactics like ad-hominem. There is no issue in correcting others, but calling others \"liars\" outright because there might be some error in the person's descriptions, without considering the possibility of that they may be unaware of the said mistakes due to offsets by human errors or that they were being truthful but the events recalled weren't the full picture and all that, is not cool.","replies":[{"poster":"Valor Carrys","date":"2016-12-23T15:42:59.513+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Dude your complaining about an MF ult doing 1k damage and saying you got hit with one wave, you clearly have no fucking clue what you are talking about.\n\nIf she is underfed your minimum getting hit by 4(250 AD)-5(200 AD) and being crit on every wave, which isn't realistic (neither is the fact that she has an IE and only an IE to be realistically underfed.)\n\nLike you are complaining about an MF ult, when you clearly don't even understand how it works.\n\n>There is no issue in correcting others, but calling others \"liars\" outright because there might be some error in the person's descriptions, without considering the possibility of that they may be unaware of the said mistakes due to offsets by human errors or that they were being truthful but the events recalled weren't the full picture and all that, is not cool.\n\nLying like you did is not cool, the fact that you even typed out that MF ult hit you for one wave and hit you for 1k damage is not cool, so don't try and whine like it means anything different here.","replies":[{"poster":"SEKAI","date":"2016-12-23T15:49:04.200+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Valor Carrys,realm=OCE,application-id=Ntey9fRZ,discussion-id=xYnbJbAX,comment-id=000100010000,timestamp=2016-12-23T15:42:59.513+0000)\n>\n> Dude your complaining about an MF ult doing 1k damage and saying you got hit with one wave, you clearly have no fucking clue what you are talking about.\n> \n> If she is underfed your minimum getting hit by 4(250 AD)-5(200 AD) and being crit on every wave, which isn&#x27;t realistic (neither is the fact that she has an IE and only an IE to be realistically underfed.)\n> \n> Like you are complaining about an MF ult, when you clearly don&#x27;t even understand how it works.\n> \n> Lying like you did is not cool, the fact that you even typed out that MF ult hit you for one wave and hit you for 1k damage is not cool, so don&#x27;t try and whine like it means anything different here.\n\nYou seem to work under the pretense that I made up that number, I didn't. I don't know where I may have remember things a bit wrong that I used to _try and justify_ that number (which as I've clearly stated in the previous post that I'm open to corrections on the details that I have observed wrongly) but the matter of fact is that I indeed died to a MF ulti that did 1010 damage to me in that game. The damage number is the fact, the \"I think I only got hit once\" is the personal observations and deduction on my part in order to make sense that fact (which could and will be subjected to potential human errors), you somehow got the role of 2 completely backwards for some reason.\n\nI mean, you could even search up my match history, near the end of the game where we were already on the highway to doom (we ended up surrendering), there was one teamfight near the dragon pit where it shows that I got killed by Teemo (killer), that was when I met the 1010 damage MF ulti (the one that technically killed me). I called her relatively unfed because she had way more assists than kills instead of the other way around for an ADC, and she was still on like the 6th kill when that ulti happened.\n\nI mean, that wasn't even the main focus of this rant at all, it's really just a thing that kinda happened and got carried across the event that's all, while the thing I was actually ranting  about isn't even that but totally something else.
