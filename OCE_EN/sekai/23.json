(let&#039;s just say I am quite iffy about the reliability of the report system)\n\n______________\n_____________\n\nI have an unpopular opinion about a champ, which I argued about it with 2 people in-game which, well it happens and I&#039;m k with that.\n\nWhat I am not fine with is how because it&#039;s an unpopular opinion it somehow means &quot;I am open to get any kind of insults thrown directly at my face and it&#039;s cool&quot; to those 2 people. I mean come on.\n\n1. Way to tell me that I&#039;m in Bronze and somehow it&#039;s a bad thing socially or intellectually to be there. \n2. Way to assume my age and imagine that I get bullied a lot at school (lol?). \n3. Way to tell me I have autism and asperger while disrespecting those who actually have them too because why not. \n4. And way to assume I&#039;m suicidal and be &quot;kind&quot; enough to encourage me not to do so.\n\netc etc.\n\nI don&#039;t think it&#039;s okay, not at all, especially the stuff they threw at me as the fight went on, well more like one of them because the other one quit it slightly earlier which I do kinda appreciate. \n\nYes I generally take shiet talking with a grain of salt thesedays, but to me there is a line between general trashing about and being downright offensive, I think at least 1 of those 2 definitely cross that line one way or the other.\n\nCall me sensitive and that I need to grow a thicker skin. I just at a personal level don&#039;t find their attitude sitting right with me and I wish to get them punished, even a wrist slap would be fine to serve as a reminder. \n\nBut oh well.","replies":[{"poster":"Jink","date":"2015-09-18T10:13:55.710+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"Dear diary.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Tele","date":"2015-09-18T10:42:39.131+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Are you kidding me?

The guy didn't participate this so called fight nor was I even trying to start it in the first place.\n\nIf the one who was playing the champ I expressed complaints about were not even protesting against me voicing my thoughts, others have no right to come around and slap my face because my views don't align with theirs. it doesn't work that way.\n\nIt's not my fault if someone decides to be an arsehole over a statement that isn't even directed at anywhere near him.

You see someone illegally coming in the opposite direction at an incredible speed, you have plenty of time to avoid this accident but choose not to.

This wasn't a contest gone wrong, it was a full on battle to begin with.\n\nYou see, I wasn't doing that great during the match (in fact I performed really badly), and had the audacity to say a thing or 2 about my displeasure with seeing Lee in a match because fk me right?\n\n>others have no right to tell me to stop\" 100% agree as long as you were not harassing them. But if you choose to continue an abusive argument, you should be partially liable for anything that happens beyond that point \n\nI didn't \"continue\" per se, all I was trying to do is give them an idea on how problematic Lee as a champ is while all they do is telling me that I'm wrong, stupid, disabled, suicidal and whatnot.\n\nWhich later on I simply took a backseat and feed them with \"k\" and see how things goes, and it got a lot nastier as time went on, even though I barely said anything.\n\nIf the players go out of their ways to act stupid on a comment that wasn't even directed at them and was merely using it as an excuse to vent out on someone viciously, they deserve a heads up or 2, that's all there is to it.\n\nEDIT: Ofc I am not complaining about the result here, what I have problems with is their attitude. I am not moaning about my broken bones because I didn't dodge the car, I am simply saying they shouldn't even be coming after me because I said something to a guy that they heard, which got them pissed for no reason.","replies":[{"poster":"Tele","date":"2015-09-18T22:23:39.694+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"We're almost there;\n\nThey did act within their rights until they started to harass you.

If I was moderating the tribunal I would not consider you innocent. If you didn't like their behaviour, why would you bait them to give you more?
