As the all-champ-f2p is completely nullified by the fact key fragments don&#039;t drop if you are playing a champion you do not own, and thus people simply don&#039;t play the champs they do not own which is counter-intuitive to the cause.\n\nThat&#039;d be awesome.\n\nOr really, imo key fragments should drop regardless of whether or not you own a champion in the first place.

If riot tries to encourage champion diversity by giving us 10 free champions every week, then not being able to acquire keys from wins with f2p champs seems counterintuitive.\n\nIts not like keys aren't hard enough to get in the first place.

I do not know when this will be solved but it&#x27;s being worked on!\n\nIt's unintended? Didn't know that because there will always be a quote that specifically states that one can not earn keys if they're playing a champion they do not own in the end-game chat (if one's not playing an owned champion).\n\nMaybe it was intended like that, but removed later and somehow for some reason it's still in the game, or that they only put up that line after realising the bug's existence as a temporarily headsup for people wondering why keys don't drop. Or something along those lines I won't know.\n\nBut hey, thanks for the update on the matter. I sincerely hope that would be fixed and lifted very soon. Please haste.","replies":[]}]}]}
