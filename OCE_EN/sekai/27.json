That really is kinda much.\n\nTwo consecutive \"ch1ng ch0ng\" mockeries as soon as I walked out of my house doors, different gang and about 1 min apart; then the last one being that they lined up for the counter but would not let me pass no matter the standard procedure (I got what I wanted, problem is that I couldn't leave...), while pretending that they didn&#039;t see nor hear me asking to go through them (2 of them were literally looking at me and did nothing to give way; and these fuckers apparently don&#039;t feel too, because they also didn&#039;t budge when I was squeezing through them).\n\nAyyyyyyyyyyyyyyy lmao?\n\n/Dear diary","replies":[]}
