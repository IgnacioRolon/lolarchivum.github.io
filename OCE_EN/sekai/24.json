This usually results in a pointless and unfun session where if you get lucky by having a meta team you win by default, or if you don&#039;t you pretty much auto lose (I&#039;m talking about Norms here).\n\nAre there any ways to play around the said situation when you&#039;re not having a meta team? I don&#039;t like playing meta every single game, that would be too boring, but getting rekt every single game isn&#039;t fun either.\n\nAny suggestions?\n\nAs a mainly jungle and top player I generally try to help the team and snowball myself to victory, but there is a limit on how much 1 person can do to stop carries getting fed. I can't really monitor and stop 4 people at the same time.\n\nOr it&#039;s just one of those permanent issues with Norms that I just gotta suck up with?","replies":[{"poster":"FroggyStylez","date":"2015-10-03T06:07:08.498+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"If the enemy team has no tank or support, they are more likely to lose because theres noone to protect them or get them fed in the first place.","replies":[]},{"poster":"TeCoolMage","date":"2015-09-30T17:07:26.282+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"So you're saying meta teams are rare?\n\nI think my head just blew up, please give me some time as I look for a new one.\n\n1 hr later\n\nWhy the hell can't I get a non meta team? It's always the stuck up \"I only care about winning even in bots so don't you dare go any top lane that isn't Garen or Darius, any support that isn't Janna or Blitzcrank, any mid that isn't Zed or Yasuo (AD mids... I hate them.), any ADC that isn't Vayne or Jinx, or any jungle that isn't Yi or Shaco\" players I get paired up with. Literally the other 1-4 players if I don't have a full premade do this all the time. Then they end up feeding the Jungler or my lane just to spite me when their pride gets scarred from me proving their knowledge on champion effectiveness wrong.\n\nAnyway, it's not meta if it's rare, and if you always lose when most teams aren't what you consider optimal, then something's wrong as both teams experience the same problems in champion select and the only general difference statistically speaking when measuring a specific non-common players team history is the player himself.\n\nE.g. Nearly all players pick carries according to your observations. Let's assume you're not going to say \"but muh matchmakin is borken, muh team alwayz sukz moar 4 sum reason!11!1!!!one!11\" and what you say is true for both sides\nIf we follow a player who never picks a carry, the team will generally be\n4 carries and a non carry on the player's team\n5 carries on the enemy team.\nThe 4 carries team loses almost all the time.\n\nIf the team with 4 carries and the non carry always loses, and usually all 9 carries are average joes who are below your standard, then the non carry is what causes the loss. He might not necessarily be bad in his abilities, mechanics or general gameplay, but it's safe to assume he's bad in the context of everyone else being a carry, regardless of his KDA.\n\nMy advice? Quit complaining about the statistically homogenous population and adapt to it yourself.","replies":[]},{"poster":"JasonWazza","date":"2015-09-25T05:48:53.054+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Easy get normal draft implemented.","replies":[{"poster":"SEKAI","date":"2015-09-25T06:37:12.940+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=JasonWazza,realm=OCE,application-id=FjGAIbRv,discussion-id=ArEeOoYb,comment-id=0000,timestamp=2015-09-25T05:48:53.054+0000)\n>\n> Easy get normal draft implemented.\n\nWish we have that yo.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"DragonOfTheVoid","date":"2015-09-25T07:02:09.744+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"or just have 4 caries of your own if you cant beat em join em","replies":[]}]}
