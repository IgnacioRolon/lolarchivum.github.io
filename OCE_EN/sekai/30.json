I'm just being the skeptic guy here, picking on that he's still using button loading to design champions, which I really would like to see him working on either reducing or at least make it meaningful than just being a pile of checklists; and I guess WW is the first step towards that, which is okay.","replies":[{"poster":"Niji","date":"2017-01-14T12:41:50.305+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I didn't even realise he was the one responsible.

I guess it comes down to the fact while many of his abilities now has double-cast, each of their effect isn't over-the-roof loaded or that they cover every aspect possible in the kit. WW comes off as a more \"natural\" champ if you know what I mean.\n\nStill, it's a bit bummer to still see the \"press every button\" signature approach of CertainlyT whenever he wants to put a champion together, I wish he could work on that for the better in future.\n\nDon't get me wrong, this thread wasn't actually made to bash him, as new WW doesn't seem too bad really, I'm just pushing out some skepticism considering the badwater I've had with this guy.","replies":[{"poster":"Niji","date":"2017-01-14T13:02:24.756+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=SEKAI,realm=OCE,application-id=Ntey9fRZ,discussion-id=dQ2Ewy6k,comment-id=00000000,timestamp=2017-01-14T12:54:01.602+0000)\n>\n> True, I didn&#x27;t notice as much in the new WW by the looks of it either.
