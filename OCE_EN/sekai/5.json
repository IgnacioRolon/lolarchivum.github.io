So I waited for I don&#039;t know 2 or 3 patches (? Not sure) and I saw that,\n\n**They are overhauling BC, buffing BotRK and gutting Cinderhulk.** Turns out I was right all along. It&#039;s like a straight slap in the face to tanks while walking around shouting \"see? squishies are better after all\".\n\nWhy why WHY Riot, with every time you step forward do you almost always take 2 steps backwards later?\n\nI get it, you&#039;re saying that Cinderhulk&#039;s introduction made tanks viable again but it also made Sunfire pointless to exist so it needs to get nerfed. But this to me sounds completely illogical, assuming I am not just bat shiet insane to begin with. **They shouldn&#039;t have shared a unique passive in the first place if they were intended to fill different purposes for different phase of the game!**\n\nIt&#039;s like having IE and Hydra to share the same passive, having RoA and Zhonya to share the same passive or hell, having Warrior enchant share the same passive with BC or Ghostblade. You see how ridiculous that is in the first place?\n\nFINE. I will be generous and take the stupid gut and buffs on stuff (just like what I have always been doing as a tank lover), but please Riot, **at least make the Cinderhulk and Sunfire&#039;s passives individual instead of unique.**\n\nAt least I won&#039;t be too salty.\n\n/rant","replies":[{"poster":"BarryButcher","date":"2015-05-01T14:16:41.189+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":2,"body":"LOL why would they make is individual?

Unique passive should only be on items they serve similar use to prevent over stacking, similar effect isn't the end of it.\n\nI know they are probably still traumatised by the metagolem back in S2, buy why are tanks the only one receiving such long term custody when we have been through things like assassin meta, S3, FF and whatnot. Are they really that afraid of tanks?\n\nBut anyway, the button line is, Cinderhulk and Sunfire sharing same passive frankly just doesn't really make sense. I can overlook the gut and the stupid buffs, and maybe just another small nerf on Cinderhulk if they can just remove the item restriction on tanks. It's not like they don't have enough of it already.","replies":[]}]}]}
