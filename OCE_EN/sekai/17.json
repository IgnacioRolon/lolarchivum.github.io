Why does it have to be today while I was at work?\n\nWHY?\n\nOh well, I still have my lots, lots of 2D waifus in my folder I guess. I no need 3D inferior ones hmph!","replies":[{"poster":"The Spawn Man","date":"2015-05-02T22:09:48.926+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"To be honest - and mate, I'll always be honest with you my friend - if you're calling girls 'waifu's' and saying you'd rather stick to a 2D girl than a real one, then I don't think you're mentally ready for a girlfriend. There is a quote \"When I was a child, I spoke and thought and reasoned as a child. But when I grew up, I put away childish things.\" That's from the Bible. Basically it's saying that even Moses had more game than you. Love is serious, and if you see it from a child's perspective, then it ain't gonna last long. And if you're getting annoyed about your bro getting hit on (don't be a c*ck block by the way), I can assure you, your girlfriend leaving you is going to hurt a billion times more. Call girls, girls. And 2D waifu's what they are: porn. You can't watch a sunset with a website, buddy. You can't feel that tingle left on your lips after your first kiss. The only warmth you will feel from a porn magazine is if you catch it right out of the printer.\n\nI was like you once. I'd see a hot girl. They'd chat to my friends, and I would watch. Alone. I'd go home, heavy-hearted, and thrust my hands into the air. \"WHY LORD! WHY HAVE THOUST FORSAKEN ME!\" Lightning would crash, and salty tears would stream down my face. I'd clench my fists and profane that I didn't need stupid girls. All dumb going for other guys. Why was it never me! Although I'd never call them waifu's, so that was a good start I guess. But I digress…\n\nWhat I was feeling was this: Regret. Regret I wasn't confident enough to talk to girls. Regret that I was alone. You're feeling it now too. Don't hate on girls (I take this from your 'inferior' comment). Don't hate them because you have regrets. The only thing you should hate is that you let yourself miss that opportunity. Hate it with all your might. Remember it. Stick it on your wall. \"I hate the fact I didn't ask out that girl on the bus\". Then do what everyone should do: live life without regrets. Don't sit at home and get angry at life and girls and your brother that you missed on *one* opportunity to meet a nice girl. Go out there, grab life by the acorns, and get that essence of what life is all about: experience. Life is joy, life is pain. But it's life, and you're not living if you're at home 'hateful' that it wasn't you. Instead of writing on a League of Legends board, camp out that anime store. Talk to some girls that are interested in that same stuff you are. Get rejected. Get accepted. Get experience. Your 'waifu' is waiting for you out there, not in your C: drive. I believe in you buddy!\n\nRemember this: Whether you think you can, or you think you cannot… You're right!\n\n~ Love, Spawn Man.","replies":[{"poster":"TouchMyKimchi","date":"2015-05-03T10:14:33.957+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Top Rekt.\n\nBut what he meant to say was: \"Get good virgin\"","replies":[{"poster":"The Spawn Man","date":"2015-05-03T11:55:36.873+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Nearly spat my coffee out!

Granted, there was some salt sprayed onto it here and there but the general attitude within this thread was not constructed to vent frustration as a whole, but stands as more of an entertaining salt piece.\n\nThe last line was simply me trying to duplicate the conscience of the fox from the story The Fox and the Grapes, and to stay to the theme of the original post it was also an attempt to display what we call a \"tsundere\" attitude where one would act tough on the surface while the inside is craving the object he/she is trying to reject substantially. I apologise if that came across as a somewhat rude and ignorant remark but it was written there for no other than comedy purposes.\n\nIn short, as salty I may have sounded, I really wasn't mad per se.\n\nThanks for you insight and opinion nevertheless, you do share some valid points for me to think about.","replies":[{"poster":"The Spawn Man","date":"2015-05-03T11:59:34.041+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yeah I get that it wasn't written in a fully serious tone.
