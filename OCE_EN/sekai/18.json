We hardly ever get movies very quickly other then in cinemas, usually being months behind the rest of the world.\n2. VPN's won't be blocked (or have been said that they shouldn't be blocked as breaching copyright isn't the primary intention of them), which of course means you will still be able to bypass this if you retain half a brain.","replies":[{"poster":"Vote 1 Trump","date":"2015-06-14T11:21:10.953+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"That isn't what the bill does at all. It imposes some degree of liability for copyright breaches at the ISP level, since imposing it at end user level is all but unenforceable. ISPs will be forced to block access to certain content channels to protect themselves from being held liable for what their customers do with them. It will fail spectacularly and be repealed at the next change of government if it does get through.","replies":[{"poster":"Chicken4dinner","date":"2015-06-14T11:54:31.915+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Holy shit, There is a person underneath the Troll","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"GigaPube","date":"2015-06-14T06:44:39.861+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":2,"body":"wtf does this have to do with league m8? gtfo with that weeaboo shit","replies":[{"poster":"SEKAI","date":"2015-06-14T06:48:47.836+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=GigaPube,realm=OCE,application-id=Ntey9fRZ,discussion-id=GdYuoxrQ,comment-id=0000,timestamp=2015-06-14T06:44:39.861+0000)\n>\n> wtf does this have to do with league m8? gtfo with that weeaboo shit\n\nI posted in misc board, so take your hate somewhere else, this thread is for my hate only.","replies":[]}]}]}
