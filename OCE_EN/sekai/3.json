Fortunately he was fighting Pantheon which makes it thematically similar to the lore today about mount targon. Players have anticipated Ao Shin for a long time and when Riot finally announced Aurelion Sol players were excited and captivated.\n\nAurelion Sol essentially created the universe League of Legends is in, forging stars which let to the evolution of life, after attempting to meet his creation on Runeterra he was betrayed and enslaved. After breaking free he now holds vengeance but does not wish to destroy his work. This has somehow managed to make him give off a \"boss\" vibe, with the help of the incredible voice acting work.\n\nOn top of this he has very unique mechanics in the game that not only go with his theme but manage to perfectly design him in a way that you could see a bigger than the world dragon in the space of a Fat Man with spider legs. Aurelion Sol's gameplay flows together perfectly, and is actually a strong pick. Korean challenger player Apdo (or Dopa) has made remarks about Sol expressing that \"he is actually broken, and anyone who climbed with him are boosted trash. Bronze players could out lane Challengers with Sol\". This is slightly outdated but still rings true in his current laning phase.\n\nHe obviously isn't broken or boosted trash, but after the fine tuning he is a rare but interesting pick. His Q, ult and W flow together well. His E and Q make for good roaming capabilities, and his ability to make plays is unmatched. Definitely a good champion to add to your pool. You might want to watch a one trick though, starting dark seal and refillable pot, backing at lvl 3 and buying a Hextech GLP first. Rylais is a good second item after the change.\n\nTaliyah was also a highly anticipated champion. People compared the rock wielder to the rock element out of avatar the last airbender. While I can't I have seen or know the cartoon it seems to have a following. Taliyah is a champion with pretty unique mechanics as fair as her basic kit goes, though her ult faced some criticism explaining that her ultimate ability it too similar to the recent abilities, usually movement spells like TF ult, Ryze ult, Pantheon ult, Tahm Kench ult, Aurelion Sol E and many more. \n\nHowever, she seemed very week on first release. Riot soon buffed her and she settled in. My personal opinion is that she needs more buffing, not to say you can't win with her. She does a lot of burst damage when mastered. She will never be banned and never really be picked so if you want to play her you can whenever. He Q makes her capable of strong early poke, her passive and Q make her mobile, her W is a good CC or engage ability, her E is very good for zoning or dealing heavy burst damage in her full combo, and her ult is one of the strongest abilities in the game right now. It can completely wall off an area and transport Taliyah any distance she wishes.\n\nOverall she is definitely a decent champion and good because players don't have experience versing her, when the meta shifts and she becomes super relevant or even OP you will be thankful you understand her. Both champions are 975 with is the average price for a champion at their stage. I recommend buying all champions but these two are a priority for you.\n\nYou cannot have more fun than playing Aurelion Sol or Taliyah, in the future their skins will be very creative and are pretty much a must have for any mid laner looking to up his game.","replies":[{"poster":"SEKAI","date":"2016-12-27T18:01:48.687+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Rengorax,realm=OCE,application-id=Ntey9fRZ,discussion-id=sHoYEbAb,comment-id=0005,timestamp=2016-12-27T10:44:03.712+0000)\n> [stuff]\n\nThat's why more detailed than I've anticipated, I even got a basic build path out of this lol.

He has over 30 mins of lines (meaning you wont even hear all of them in a game.)\n\nbut he is countered by every single meta champion atm\nall those champs you were talking about before (how you only ever see Yasuo Riven Lee etc..) they SHIT on him.\n\nTaliyah can stand up to Yasuo/Riven/Lee much better, and her roams are far superior to Sol's. \nBut her personality (while awesome) is your typical \"Do your best!\" \"If i look forward, ill keep moving\" etc etc kind of champ, which is cool, but less interesting than Sol's \n\nSol has far more damage, but far less burst. \n\n\nin other words, neither one is better than the other. and it is near impossible to choose between them :P\n\n(id make a horrible salesman aye haha xD)\n\ni just love both of them too much to choose.\n\n{{champion:136}} {{champion:163}}","replies":[{"poster":"SEKAI","date":"2016-12-27T10:02:04.088+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Lord Sesshomaru,realm=OCE,application-id=Ntey9fRZ,discussion-id=sHoYEbAb,comment-id=0001,timestamp=2016-12-27T08:58:30.597+0000)\n> {{champion:136}} {{champion:163}}\n\nThanks for the in-depth discussion.

The pressure is definitely there (Rylai's eases it as the games go on though, thankfully).\n\nThen again, man isn't she satisfying to play when you do pull her off. So much flexibility, so much presence, so much impact, pretty glorious. Yeah my first impression with her has been very positive so far.\n\nOnce I've saved enough, I'll be trying out Aurelion Sol as the next champ. For now, I'll play around with Taliyah.","replies":[{"poster":"Lord Sesshomaru","date":"2016-12-30T01:23:31.149+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Both Sol and Taliyah are difficult.\nTheir kits arent complex, but you need perfect positioning to play both of them. And thats a lot harder than 'difficult combos'.\n\nChamps like Zed, Lee, Leblanc, even Azir can afford to be out of position occasionally, as they all have such forgiving kits to help them escape.\n\nYou get out of position as Sol, you die. \nIts that simple.\n\nand yea man Taliyah is SO satisfying when you pull off her combos.\nIll tell you, there are few feelings better than ulting bot lane, placing your rocks, they flash over the wall, and you just 'pop' them back over it again with your W (hitting all the rocks of course) \nits one of the best feelings in the game. xD","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Azirious Mistake","date":"2016-12-29T05:49:05.054+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Well think of it this way, you have a universe-wielding star dragon, or Toph from Avatar the Last Airbender.
