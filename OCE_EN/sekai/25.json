So much about their \"F2P\" model, while it&#039;s not like say, Nexon level but oh my god it&#039;s definitely way worse than Riot&#039;s. And I mean, it&#039;s BLIZZARD! Probably the most well known and richest (debatable since Valve) game company to date, you need this shady method to cash in?\n\nAre you that hungry?\n\nAnd btw they deliberately limit the amount of in-game gold you can grind per day, which is what we free-to-players use to buy things with, therefore playing Hearthstone at some point in time you literally will HAVE to pay. Yeah I get the anti-bot stuff but I am fairly sure there are better ways to track bots without resorting to make the game both **Pay to Play** AND **Pay to Win**.\n\nI do know trading card games is known to be sorta pay to win, since you need a bunch of decks while constantly getting/buying new ones to stay competitive and all. But really, no one should expect this game to be THIS pay to win.\n\n***Mech decks is pretty much just the tip of the iceberg, it's just the most noticeable one for new players and it gets worse from that.***\n\nYes, you don&#039;t Have to pay, I get it. However enjoying losing to unfair matchups where you simply can&#039;t do jack shiet against superior decks is a fun in and of itself I guess.\n\n/rage","replies":[{"poster":"Chicken4dinner","date":"2015-04-02T12:39:41.869+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Or you can get a job and just play magic...\n\nplus this is league of legends............... bub","replies":[{"poster":"SEKAI","date":"2015-04-03T12:12:21.122+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I do have a job, but I refuse to pay a f2p game where money is required to stay competitive even in casual matckmaking (it's like if LoL needs you to pay to stand a chance in Normals, will you accept that? No.), and when you do pay we will be talking about hundreds here since everything is locked behind pay/grind walls.\n\nFrom cards to expansions to arena, they are all locked. And you only get rewarded when you win if you intend to grind your way through, that's how the grind works in this game, so if you lose you pretty much get nothing unless your hero is under level 10.\n\nAnd guess what, if you don't pay, you win less, which means it takes even longer to grind what you want, even more so than their gatekeeping on how much gold you can earn per day.\n\nThis game is pretty fked on so many level, it's a free to play where you have to pay to play, it's a game where more money gets you more power and it's also a free to play game where it's possible for you to grind everything on paper yet impossible to achieve dare I say more than 20 - 25% of the content in practice.\n\nHearthstone is a hilariously designed game, not sure what the hell people are praise it for and why it even got Game of the Year, besides the nicely crafted aesthetic and the diversity of the battlecry pool everything else is straight trash.\n\nEDIT: Yer I know this is LoL forum but hey I posted in Miscellaneous.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Garens Harem","date":"2015-04-02T23:26:26.454+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"hearthstone is p2w so hard.\n\n\nthe game would be so much better if it wasn't","replies":[{"poster":"SEKAI","date":"2015-04-03T12:05:20.208+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yeah it would be hella better if it's either better constructed or simply pay to play. I wouldn't mind paying 40 or so bucks for a game, but when you have a f2p game that costs more than p2p that just to play, something is very wrong.\n\nI spent 3 days playing that game vigilantly, it really doesn't take a smart guy to realise that the game is probably only _somewhat _ balanced for rich hats who feel like spending literally hundreds of bucks buying essentials in a game, even then I still say this game is horribly balanced as a whole.\n\nIf you play on, you'll constantly run into arse holes who have a deck full of stuff that are more resource efficient, better stats, better special effects or contain multiple battlecries of your standard cards on 1 single monster.\n\nAlmost everybody I run into run mechs who have fkin nonsense battlecries in their decks, or sometimes I occasionally meet a guy full of legendary cards while taunting you the entire game endlessly.\n\nThis game is not balanced tbh, even if everyone has everything available to them, since you get legendaries, mechs and the bad, bad balance policy of \"introduce new things to balance what's OP instead of actually fixing the game ourselves\". But as a whole it's insulting to suggest when a game locks literally everything behind pay walls or eternal grinds, while limiting how much you will be able to actually grind, then have the entire game designed to be this \"pay to have convenience AND an edge\" thing, is balanced.\n\nEverything that relates to gathering cards costs. \n\n* Need to buy cards from shop? Pay up \n* Need to access expansions? Pay up. \n* Need to access arena? Pay up.\n\nLet's not mention that unbalanced piece of shat that is arena, your hero is random, your cards are randomly given to you and ofc, once you're inside the game your card draw is also fking random. And if you got kicked out after losing 3 matches, pay up to enter. What the Actual F**u**ck.\n\nYes, it's **possible** to unlock the whole or most of the game by simply playing, the game does allow that. What it doesn't tell you is that you'll be gatekept by the people who pay, the awful grinding system and the mind blowing RNG that is almost always working against you. Nigh impossible might as well be impossible.\n\nI would rather have a priced game that cost a few bucks and have a balanced gameplay and healthy grinding aspect than this \"f2p\" where you need to pay literally hundreds to stand the ground, and the more you pay translates you to the more you actually win unless your brain is already long dead, and you don't know anything about how to play.\n\nI haven't hated Blizzard this much since Diablo 3, I really thought they got better, oh well I will see if Overwatch or HotS is any different otherwise Blizzard is gonna be one of my most hated game companies alongside EA, Activision and Bethesda.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"P1 GTR","date":"2015-04-03T00:34:55.221+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"i play with mech decks Kappa","replies":[]},{"poster":"Unseen Predator","date":"2015-04-02T14:41:52.430+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Still waiting for face Hunter nerfs.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Autismo Extremo","date":"2015-04-02T14:23:20.501+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"fufuffjfjfufufjfjfufufufufufuch y0000000000000000000000000","replies":[]},{"poster":"Zero Infinity","date":"2015-04-02T09:16:30.239+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I recently started Hearth.

They balance like Riot tbh, instead of making broken cards/decks balanced they make new cards to counter them, and you will need to either grind or pay for them. Then the grind issue comes back and I am just sitting here wondering if I should actually continue on this game.","replies":[]}]}]}
