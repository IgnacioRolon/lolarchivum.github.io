And as the thread title suggests, everyone should go and watch it.\n\nFirst thing first, a few people might get caught off-guard by the main character&#039;s later costume looking slightly not fitting to the show&#039;s setting, it&#039;s because this is an anime based on a game of the same name released in 2002 after all, so keep that in mind while watching it.\n\nIt has nice and fluid animations, and with the show's constant attention to details it makes both conversation and fighting scenes interesting to behold and keep eyes on.  While the graphics/artstyle certainly looks a bit dated, since it was made from a decade ago, but it is definitely not saying it's old or bad, it's not bad at still looks pretty darn nice today honestly.\n\nThe Opening is stylish and cool, the Ending is pure feelings.\n\nThen the story, HOLY SHIET, the story. It&#039;s emotional, it&#039;s meaningful and it gets you think (at least for me). All the characters, except one guy who turned into an insane prick for exactly 0 reason, otherwise the series is full of in-depth character developments. One of the best out there, given there is only 26 episodes in total and how much it achieved in that amount of time. Everyone has their reasons and beliefs to why they were doing what they were doing, be it right or wrong in other's or even their own moral standards.\n\nAlso the finale is fairly open ended, it opens up 4 or so main archetypes, a little more if you have paid attention to details during the show. Use all what you have learned in the series to your advantage, and figure out which ending you THINK is the true ending of Gungrave besides that one obvious outcome the series is trying to trick you into believing, which is most likely not the real one if you give it a second thought.\n\n_______________________________\n\n**The series is great. Great action, nice graphics, stylish OP and feeling ED, awesome story and the meanings behind it and a top notch finale. It started with a bang and it ends with an explosion. What else is there to ask for?**\n\n**Definitely a 9/10 or 10/10 material, **\n\n**Why are you still here, go watch it. Now.**","replies":[{"poster":"GoldenTomat0","date":"2015-04-09T10:42:26.109+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"26 eps, come on man.","replies":[{"poster":"SEKAI","date":"2015-04-09T10:58:53.231+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"26 eps ain't that long, I watched them all in 1 night.\n\nAnd I kinda appreciate it's 26 ep instead of like 13, since it's almost like every minute matters in this show, so if they had cut half of the content out, Gungrave wouldn't be Gungrave.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"jb3navides","date":"2015-04-09T10:42:52.224+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"***","replies":[{"poster":"SEKAI","date":"2015-04-09T10:57:37.390+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"While normally people should point you to Crunchyroll since well, pay up.\n\nBut it's not like there are no backdoors to go through, Kissanime, is where you can watch free animes, if a said anime has both sub and dub versions the site generally has them.\n\nSo use them at your own risk aye.\n\nAlso since the site is getting upgrades recently, you will probably run into a few issues when you watch animes there now, however Gungrave is generally fine outside a few cases of vid not  loading and you will need to refresh the page.","replies":[]}]}]}
