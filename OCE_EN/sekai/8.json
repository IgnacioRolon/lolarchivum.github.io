Easy, we all know that, and we also know it&#039;s based on one of the sword-drawing schools originated in Japan (as far as I know, pretty sure that&#039;s the case, if not, at least it&#039;s the most well known one hence the inspiration on Yasuo).\n\nNow I&#039;m not even going to bother entering the &quot;sub-categorisation debate&quot; between Iaido, Iaijutsu and Battojutsu etc, because they are literally referring to the same thing, where only former-most is actually referring to the martial art itself, while the latter 2 refer to either a very general term of the art or the application of the art.\n\nIaido, while a term that&#039;s more recently conceived and compiled, it is the natural progression of the sword-drawing techniques that was used in the even older years, and focuses on the efficiency of attack/defence, keeping the sword clean, and training focus/concentration/precision (the last part is why Iaido is also considered by many as a spiritual training, which is also how the discipline is generally taught today in the world where swords have been outdated).\n\n.......................\n\nConsidering his preference of fighting using Iaido, a fighting style that is often associated with &quot;1 shot 1 kill&quot; type of philosophy, which is why every &quot;kata&quot; or &quot;drill&quot; or &quot;set-move&quot; ends with the sword being put back into sheath, Yasuo is very different to his source of inspiration, almost an 180 degrees in difference. Yasuo, unlike the art he was based on which not only prefer but promote shorter fights, instead he&#039;s an AA carry who pushes and shines in extended fights. Hell, his Q and E alone already breaks the mold. There is a very big thematic dissonance, and it&#039;s not there comically or to challenge the stereotype as it&#039;s pretty obvious that Riot is serious about the dude, which makes the case very curious and jarring to say the least.\n\nNow even in say, anime media and other works in Japan, where katana and etc get the most exposure and glorification which also naturally comes about many portrayals that may slightly distort the expectation and perception of the real-world counterpart of the same item in a certain way, understands that Iaido users would generally like to keep the fight short and ideally in 1 hit or 2. But somehow Yasuo missed the memo with quite a margin.\n\nAs mentioned earlier, Iaido is often associated with an air of precision, concentration, peacefulness, and spiritual enlightenment in some way, which well, is written all over Yasuo&#039;s face, thematically. There is no mistaking that he is meant to be a pretty dead-set Iaido user at this stage, but the gameplay doesn&#039;t match up, not when his kit is literally about spamming when Iaido has always been about fast planning and executing it decisively. Sure, Yasuo also put his sword back into sheath every time he goes out of combat too, and he also charges into a fight before pulling his bad boy out, we get it, it&#039;s supposed to mimic how Iaido is generally understood as. But the context has change drastically. Because Yasuo is far more similar to that of a free-form fighter who has learned some fundamentals of Iaido than being a disciplined sequence-defendant/form-reliance blade-drawer which is what he is actually based on.\n\n**This round back to the title quote, &quot;Tbh, I had hoped Yasuo would turn out to be more of a methodological and tactical fighter&quot;**\n\n.......................\n\nI&#039;d hoped he would be more or of a slower-moving/slightly-immobile AD caster, or something along those lines. \n\nSomeone whose normal AA is actually just punching and kicking (though I prefer kicking because that flows better with sword-drawing based character, but imo), while each of the abilities detail some kind of set movement, ie &quot;kata&quot;, for different purposes.\n\n* There could be a kata that is entirely offensive (such as performing a uppercut and a downward chop, and allowed to end prematurely for less damage but the target is sent into air via a knockup), \n* One that&#039;s entirely defensive (such as performing a circular horizontal sweep), \n* One that&#039;s mobility based (such as a short ranged hop, not a dash, a hop. And it could be used for dodging, sidestepping, but not over walls), \n* And the ulti being a kill condition similar to current Yasuo&#039;s to some degree (go well with the first portion of the &quot;offensive&quot; kata spell mentioned just above).\n\nOr something like that, this is just a basic model to give an idea on what I was talking about, and is by no means the sole design I&#039;m pushing. And sure, enhance everything with wind and fancy just as you do with current Yasuo.\n\nBut what I wanted to say is that, the current Yasuo lacks a certain amount of grace, fluidity and discipline of his own personal source material. And that is very troubling indeed.\n\nI guess that&#039;s why he&#039;s called &quot;The Unforgiven&quot;, because his mentors and fellow colleagues are all now pissed for having raised such a badly learned swordsman who gets none of the fundamentals of his own choice of martial art, they even say the deceased elder has been throwing a tantrum in the heavens after seeing Yasuo&#039;s forms, or the complete lack thereof.\n\n(this is more or a rant)","replies":[{"poster":"CHEESYLEEKS","date":"2017-04-25T20:31:53.972+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"https://i.giphy.com/IYjiXRV622OBO.gif","replies":[{"poster":"SEKAI","date":"2017-04-25T21:01:45.260+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=CHEESYLEEKS,realm=OCE,application-id=FjGAIbRv,discussion-id=Rw8XlruK,comment-id=0000,timestamp=2017-04-25T20:31:53.972+0000)\n>\n> https://i.giphy.com/IYjiXRV622OBO.gif\n\nYouuuuuuuuuuuuu.... sajfhsahfl22@R Q2hg%V^rRF##dff3 f#F*@23##F3ff%%% gf eug hwehg33 #R#r934\n\nhttps://ircimg.net/TypingGhostInTheShell.gif","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Fitzky","date":"2017-04-26T03:28:37.769+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"*Patiently waits for Talon12*","replies":[]},{"poster":"Akkordian Zoeve","date":"2017-04-25T21:28:27.354+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I came here looking for another Yasuo complaint, but what I found was a very intelligent argument from someone who actually knows Martial Arts stuff :) Here are my \"counter arguments\", if you wish:\n\n1.

If Yasuo could one- or two-shot opponents, he would be BEYOND BROKEN, so combined with what I mentioned, it&#x27;s a way to balance him.\n\nI am not saying he has to 1 or 2 shot the opponent, though. The center point of this thread is really to show why I think Yasuo is \"out of form\", as in, his kit makes no sense to his source material. Maybe I'd failed to elaborate, but what I intended to say is that Iaido is a very \"kata\" or \"set-move\" based martial art, to the point of being almost mechanical, due to the pursuit of \"efficiency\". **And this is why, Yasuo's freestyle-like fighting outright makes no sense to his own theme. **\n\n**I mean sure if there is gonna be deviation it's all cool, but a 180 degree shift is just way too odd.** It's like saying \"here in League, the colour black looks like our world's white\" with a straight face. Wouldn't that be curious?\n\nWhat I wanted is an emphasis on choosing the right form/\"kata\" for the right situation, much like how Iaido functions irl. Or something along those lines. You can even make Yasuo an AA fighter like Yi or something, as long as you can make the theme stick and work and not running against each other.\n\nLet's take a trip to Mastery Yi: Being based on both historical Chinese swordsman and those from Wuxia fantasies, he's ended up as a techno swordsman who's very right-click based. Master Yi's kit was designed like that because he theme demands players to \"know\" in order to play into Yi's theme of being an extremely powerful sword fighter who's also wise and gracious (in the original lore he's among the oldest known mortal, he still reference that in his joke \"The key to immortality? Not dying.\"), and so his kit is thus heavily reliant on making the right call in split seconds with heavy consequences (rather high resource cost and rather serious CD, and reliant on feed to be effect etc) and showing up in the right place and at the right time; we however don't have to worry about how he swings and slices his enemies up in-between strikes, because he'd already perfected that.\n\nCould there be other design for Yi that would stick just as well? Of course! The point is just that the design has to make sense to what you're trying to portray!\n\nMake conditional combo, make repeated strikes, or whatever you think can do the kit more good, but the theme has to stick and make sense. And in the case of Yasuo, the same simply can not be said. Because, once more, his kit contradicts what his theme stands for. **A kit that is literally about and goes out of its way to promote/encourage spamming shouldn't be a result of taking inspiration from Iaido, that's just not right.**\n\nI personally would like it better if Yasuo is more methodological or more tactical, and I guess \"slower\", because that's how I would realise it if I were the designer. But yes, that's not the only design I could see possible, just that current Yasuo's isn't one among them for all of the reasons stated.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Lord Sesshomaru","date":"2017-04-25T23:07:46.223+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"While god forbid I should have to defend Yasuo...\nSometimes his Kit does reflect the 1-shot kill form.\nHe hurls his hurricane, it strikes you, in one fluid movement he ults you, lands and powers out a Q or auto for the kill.\n\nBut I see what you mean, he does definitely look and feel more like a sustained warrior, rather than the guy you piss of in a tavern and before you know it, your arm is on the floor, and his sword is back in its sheath.\n\nWhile Its good to keep true to the source material, you still have to make a good story.\nLets take Kenshin Himura for example from Rourouni Kenshin, because he is closely associated with battojutsu.\nKenshin is the fastest swordsman in the land, he specialises in battojutsu, and he knows the amakakeru ryo no hirameki the most powerful single story strike there is, its so powerful you can kill a man even with a blunt sword, and the air displaced by the strike can cause miniature whirlwinds, (remind you of anyone?)\n\nYet in most of his battles, he has to employ normal methods of sword fighting, \n1. because they have to fill a 22 min episode. and\n2. because battojutsu has no defensive application, so when Kenshin has to battle an opponent who is equally or more proficient, he cant rely solely on 1-hit techniques, without risking injury to himself or his friends.\n\nSo im guessing Yasuo is the same, they have to fill a 40 minutes game with something, but still want him to be a fast Ronin. and also, if you are part of the League of Legends, then it means that your skills are one of the highest in the world, so Yasuo would be constantly paired with his peers or superiors. _(and i just cant see a single sword strike doing much against a Star Dragon!)_\n\nAlso Iaido isn't the only point of inspiration for Yasuo, more importantly than that is the fact that he is a dishonoured, wandering, masterless samurai. \nSo his kit should better reflect that (quick movements, dishonourable techniques like dashing or wind walling). \n\nPlus, if we want to get in depth about it, look at the other champions.\nAzir for example is heavily inspired from Ra, the Egyptian god of the sun.

In fact, in many of the fights he spent the majority of the fight dodging and closing the gaps on enemies (because build-up and time-slot-padding) and sometimes even engaging in fights using his sheathed sword like a stick and some hand-to-hand maneuver and didn't even draw his sword until the instant he was sure the attack would land (that may or may not include follow up combos). He also frequently sheathed his sword after drawing during the middle of the combat when he had disengaged and resetting the fight or trying to strike a conversation with the opponent before deciding whether or not he should re-initiate.\n\nSure, obviously there are many enemies where Kenshin couldn't handle with 1 shots entirely and had to resort to the more general use of swords, but the illustrators made sure he'd almost always kept the essence of Iaido, even as he was keeping his sword out fighting in the \"conventional\" way. Even if the sword drawn in an extended contact period, he rarely dragged the fight out as the sword is unsheathed, always seek to aim for the critical blows while keeping the least amount of \"touching\", and when he was dragging it out he would usually sheath the sword (unless his PTSD was triggered, but that's besides the point).\n\nStill, even with all of it said above, I don't believe linking the pacing of a TV show has much to do with the pacing or the in-match growth curve of a character in a roster-based and match-based game. They are fundamentally different things with different things to consider hence I believe the comparison is moot. Though I do agree in the characterisation aspect of the argument where you pointed out that Iaido/Battojutsu users like Kenshin don't fight entirely with sword-draws, which I absolutely agree on.\n\nBut again, I am not pushing for the notion that Yasuo has to be EXACTLY like a perfected and diehard Iaido master, or that he has to 1 shot the enemies, or that he could never engage in the more conventional and general fighting styles. **What I am talking about is that Yasuo has simply way too less I guess, heritage, from his supposed source of inspiration.** His design builds up from his theme way too little, it's more or less just a paintjob because what he is literally has nothing to do with his defining thematic characteristic. **His combat style reminds NOTHING of battojutsu, not even in the relate-able or metaphorical sense (for the reasons I've already touched on extensively in the OP and in a couple replies), it outright is not it.** And that's such a shame.\n\nLiterally anything that makes him resemble and relate him better to an Iaido user could've been quite good,\n\n* Is it the lower potential in sustain fights and extended teamfights or duels? \n* Is it gonna be lower overall mobility and more of a burst-based such as a hop (and not chain hops)? \n* Is it that the kit would be more geared towards assassination or at least more \"parry\" based that reflects the \"quick\" aspect of his theme? \n* Is it gonna be that he would be made as more cast-based (but not spam-based)? \n* Is it that his kit would be more geared for area denial and zoning (which this Yasuo does actually do, but not because his kit allows him to zone enemies by setting up no-go zones around himself or something similar, but instead he does this via for all the wrong reasons by having poke immunity and his own long distance+spammable pokes that can be chained into a kill condition)? \n* Or is it gonna be just little things like Yasuo doesn't always draw his sword in his AA animation but only does so when he's using his abilities or when a last-hit happens?\n* Etc etc etc?\n\nBut I guess the \"slasher samurai trope\" is what they went with in the end, even though they're supposed to be working on an Iaido swordsman. This dissonance is what grinds me gears so hard (I guess the same can be said for some other champs like Morde too, but that's for another thread).\n\n> Also Iaido isn&#x27;t the only point of inspiration for Yasuo, more importantly than that is the fact that he is a dishonoured, wandering, masterless samurai. \n> So his kit should better reflect that (quick movements, dishonourable techniques like dashing or wind walling). \n\nA wandering samurai, or a ronin, is just a warrior without a lord and a knight without a king. It makes them \"defamed\" in name, and often not trusted or valued in the context of Feudal Japan or other similar societies, but that doesn't mean their form has to all be thrown out of the window too; which while is sadly what happens when someone's time stroke low a lot of times, but sure enough, that's not the case with Yasuo.\n\nIt's pretty clear that Yasuo never abandoned his discipline despite his exiled and infamous status and a broken heart filled with sadness and rage. In fact he still sought inner peace, and rigorously practiced the way of combat and living he'd been taught by his elder, and enough to pass it on to another (Taliyah) and allow them to gain control over themselves as they otherwise couldn't without his guidance.\n\nSo it's pretty safe to conclude that Yasuo shouldn't have gone from a systematic and rather reserved combat style into a free-style just because of his status. It just doesn't make sense neither to his source of inspiration and neither is it reasonable for his own character.\n \n> Plus, if we want to get in depth about it, look at the other champions.\n> Azir for example is heavily inspired from Ra, the Egyptian god of the sun.

Yasuo does not embody the spirit of Iaido, but does he really need to?\n\nActually, Azir is not only referencing Ra. His main line of inspiration included Ra, Aten, Horus and Osiris. His appearance resembles the sun god Ra and the sky god Horus. His tower references the solar disc god Aten, an aspect of Ra. His lore on the other hand references Osiris, the god of underworld and afterlife, where they were both emperors who were betrayed by someone close to them and were both revived through a female relative; interestingly to note: Osiris was originally romanised as \"wsir\". So it actually makes a lot of sense to why Azir's kit is designed as he is.\n\nSimilarly, Kha was not only a reference to xenomorph, he is also a reference to zergs from Starcraft, which by observation we know it's pretty relate-able. As for why Kha doesn't have the acidic blood, kinda because Kog already has that.\n\nGraves, well, he does have 1 spell called \"Quickdraw\", and as the name suggest, he does attack quicker with it. But really, Graves is more to do with being a generic reference to the \"Wild Wild West\", which is painted across his face and no one would deny it.\n\n_____________\n_______________\n_______________\n\n\n_Really though, my point really comes down to: That I think Yasuo has too little to do with Iaido, and he simply needs more of it to keep the reference, which is a integral part of his character, afloat. Sure, Yasuo can be his own thing, no one is saying \"reference or bust\", but he really wasn't designed to be that independent with all things considered. He was clearly meant to be your \"weeb fighter\" who mirrors and very much couple with Riven to some sense (hence their relationship) and heavily inspired by Iaido in terms of his combat techniques, that's what we're promised, but the result is imo, a bit too far from the premise to be called a successful realisation of the idea. Hence why I found it inadequate and hoped that they'd kept more of the vibe of the Iaido in than the current final product where they'd unfortunately discarded too many key elements and kept so little._\n\nBut that's my take on it. To go back to the title and complete the cycle of reasoning, I just think it makes far more sense that Yasuo is more tactic based rather than spam based, and in a sense, \"slower\", is better.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"FatedSaviour","date":"2017-04-27T02:14:26.419+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"can i have a tldr plz, if not, nws","replies":[{"poster":"SEKAI","date":"2017-04-30T07:29:04.426+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=monkiinator135,realm=OCE,application-id=FjGAIbRv,discussion-id=Rw8XlruK,comment-id=0004,timestamp=2017-04-27T02:14:26.419+0000)\n>\n> can i have a tldr plz, if not, nws\n\nSince the OP is VERY long, the tldr is also somewhat long because of it. Soz.\n\n............................\n\nEssentially, I first had spent a good portion of the thread proving that Yasuo's combat style was indeed based on the martial art Iaido.\n\nIaido is an combat form that heavily relies on precision, short bursts, and highly mechanical \"kata\" or \"sets\" that would more or less dictate how a person deals with an or multiple enemies. The point of Iaido is selecting the right moveset at the right movement, and execute the fight without it as much as happening. Or if that's not possible, the fighter will continue to reset the fight until the result is achieved.\n\nAnd this is completely contradictory to Yasuo's combat philosophy, whose kit is literally about and also goes out of its way to encourage spamming that waves his sword around as opposed to calculated and decisive bursts approach of Iaido, Yasuo is designed to thrive in extended teamfights when Iaido has always been about ending the contacts to enemies as swiftly as possible, and Yasuo is also about fighting more or less free-style as opposed to the very mechanical 'set-dependent' nature of Iaido that he's based on. \n\nThis means, Yasuo is 180 degrees different to what his theme suggests how he should fight. **And I found that curious and silly, that Yasuo's in-game design is the direct OPPOSITE of what his theme is.**\n\nThat said, I also stressed the point multiple times through the thread that, I am NOT pushing a specific design, as a champ can indeed have many interpretation and realisations, nor am I saying that a champ has to be 100% identical to their inspiration with no off-shoots. I'm only having issues with Yasuo because his design is completely contradictory to his own source of inspiration, which is frankly not right, because they 2 are supposed to be similar and complementary but that's very much not the case with Yasuo.\n\nAnd near the end of the OP I'd suggested how I would rework Yasuo if I was the designer in charge of him.","replies":[]},{"poster":"CRIMSONBO4R","date":"2017-04-27T23:36:02.681+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=monkiinator135,realm=OCE,application-id=FjGAIbRv,discussion-id=Rw8XlruK,comment-id=0004,timestamp=2017-04-27T02:14:26.419+0000)\n>\n> can i have a tldr plz, if not, nws\n\nno","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"jadelink","date":"2017-04-30T04:48:16.186+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Instead we have yasuo the 'skilled' champion, who has his highest winrate in bronze, and is a very flashy looking ball of stats, with some very cool looking maneuvers, that are testimony to animators far more skilled than game designers.","replies":[{"poster":"SEKAI","date":"2017-04-30T07:18:54.241+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=jadelink,realm=OCE,application-id=FjGAIbRv,discussion-id=Rw8XlruK,comment-id=0005,timestamp=2017-04-30T04:48:16.186+0000)\n>\n> Instead we have yasuo the &#x27;skilled&#x27; champion, who has his highest winrate in bronze, and is a very flashy looking ball of stats, with some very cool looking maneuvers, that are testimony to animators far more skilled than game designers.\n\nKinda, I can agree with this sentiment.","replies":[]}]}]}
