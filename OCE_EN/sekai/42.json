For now I&#039;ll refrain my opinion on the matter itself, but what I&#039;ll be talking about is to do with the comments below the said post.\n\nSo comments... wooooo. \n\n=> Now there was a comment **A** stating that girls don&#039;t need bras because it&#039;s bad for the back and that bras introduces other long term disadvantages without any benefits; except they were wrong and I correctly them accordingly that unless a girl has small enough breasts and nipples otherwise bras saves girls from permanent nipple fissures/irritation (from cloth frictions) and general inconveniences concerning the 2 moving parts that one have no control over, and that back damage is only a result of wearing a bra that&#039;s too tight rather than the damages of bras themselves, as well as pointing the fact girls could also very easily wear sports bras that are designed with far more emphasis on comfort in comparison to the usual ones.\n\n=> There was a comment **B** seemingly stating that girls shouldn&#039;t wear bras because it gives cancer, or increases the chances of cancer; except I did 2 seconds of google and found that breastcancer.org has already dedicated a couple separate pages on the matter, clarifying that bras DO NOT initiate nor increases the likelihood of cancer, and that it&#039;s a complete myth born from mistaking correlation with causation (heavier girls are more likely to wear bras, lighter girls are more likely to have breasts small enough to not require bras, and being heavier itself has a higher chance of having cancer, and this is incorrectly interpreted that bras make cancer). And so I commented and corrected the person accordingly.\n\n=> There was a comment **C** sharing their opinion that they found it saddening that society has to I guess, hide away our natural beauty, and that if a guy chose not to wear his underwear with his junk poking through his trousers the situation wouldn&#039;t be like this; except they are a guy, and I simply told them to try it out themselves and give us an update on just how socially &quot;norm&quot; it is. Then I also used his comment as a platform to express my personal take on the matter (now I will share a piece of my opinion), it was long and very self-contained so it imo covered my perspective entirely very well. It basically boiled down to a couple points:\n\n1. it&#039;s not just hiding and feeling ashamed of natural beauty or whatever, girls have practical reasons why they need the bra, just like men&#039;s underpants.\n2. It&#039;s natural to be distracted by a pair of moving breasts, not only it&#039;s meant to happen in terms of human evolution, it&#039;s completely a rhetoric in the animal kingdom in terms of being distracted by moving things. \n2. if what one dresses is not to be limited by another&#039;s view, then why do we see fit for one to berate others for being distracted by or otherwise have opinions on your nipples that are poking out?\n3. Social decency and mutual respect. Just as you don&#039;t want to see my junk for no reason, I don&#039;t want to see your breasts for no reason, and if you so want to show, then don&#039;t blame others for looking at it. It&#039;s really that simple.\n\n=> Oh yeah I nearly forgot, there was also a comment **D** that stated girls should not be confined by the general social expectation of dressing, and that it&#039;s a problem to do whether or not a guy should look and be distracted by a pair of breasts clearly poking out or something I really couldn&#039;t remember; and I simply replied with this &quot;so girls have no responsibility for their own public image and safety?&quot;\n\n_____________\n______________\n\nAll that being said, sounds like a lot of work aye?\n\n**Well, it&#039;s all been DELETED**, I typed all that out strictly from memory. Yes, **correcting information about BRAS can be deleted**. Now I've seen everything.\n\nAnd that&#039;s the problem with Facebook and much of the social media at large. Well-natured correction and elaboration could be ignored and removed, misinformation and ignorance could be promoted and be allowed to spread, as long as it fits a certain agenda that the moderator/group is driving or happy with. And it&#039;s absolutely sickening.\n\nNo wonder why there are so many clearly misinformed and misguided sods spamming the internet with their fearful, hateful and clearly uneducated shit, hugging each other and amplify what&#039;s already so bad about it, so much so they even bring that into real life and do damages that have no reasons to even be there.\n\nSo to summarise and to repeat myself, do NOT engage in social networks beyond friend-to-friend interactions, and do NOT use it as a main source to gain information of the world (at least not more than the basics, like a headline or 2 or something, but do other readings later than the page FB gave), and always realise, it's nothing but a little playground.\n\nTake care, and keep safe.\n\n(EDIT: yeah I very rarely use FB and social media beyond checking out memes and whatnot, I have always avoided comments on the more \"real\" topics as well as passing the possibility of me commenting myself. I did that yesterday because I had really nothing to do for 5 hours, and that seeing outright false info triggered me to correct it, though I did end up discussing my opinion later. But it doesn't matter, because I don't support the page's agenda I guess so all that effort is for naught now. That's not the problem, the problem is why should censorship even be allowed, not only that, on individual level too? Wtf?)","replies":[]}
