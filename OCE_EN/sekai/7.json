Undying Rage **can be used even when affected by crowd control**.\n> **Fury Gained: 50 / 75 / 100**\n> If Tryndamere is **below 3% maximum health when Undying Rage ends, he heals to that amount.**\n\nIs this ultimate OP in your opinion? I used to think otherwise, but atm imo it is, or at least I feel it&#039;s way too problematic to deal with.\n\nI mean most teamfights rarely even last 10 seconds how come he gets access to a guaranteed 5 second immunity, guaranteed maximum damage and guaranteed HP refund on a somewhat short CD of 100 sec or so with 0 resource cost?\n\nIt&#039;s not like he has zero utility like say Yi who is quite useless beyond winning a match that he has already won, or Nasus who effectively needs a long time to properly ramp up and can not kill people on a second basis. Trynd on the other hand outside of his potential ridiculous damage, has a reliable gapcloser and an unreliable but powerful slow (and has a AoE AD reduction in it), all on top of his instant heal. \n\nI don&#039;t mind the rest of his kit THAT much, but the ulti definitely needs to get a look at.\n\nIt lasts way too long and costs too much to pin him in place and kill him properly. It&#039;s not like it&#039;s Sion&#039;s Passive where just kiting alone actually kills the damn thing, no you still have to somehow kill Trynd after devoting a huge chunk of your resource just to prevent him from 2 shotting your entire team (let's not mention he could just E away after ulti). You can't just burst him dead either, unlike again Sion's Zombie Run or Master Yi's Highdunker, or even Nasus's \"I WIn\" in some cases given if you have someone who scales well with BotRK.\n\nAlso, once he gets beyond 2 to 3 items, it becomes impossible to duel him without at least moving 2 to 3 people on him at once every single time.\n\nThat in my opinion, is quite BS.\n\n**Knock 1 or 2 seconds from that ultimate, at the very least.**","replies":[{"poster":"SorakaXHealBoT","date":"2015-09-22T18:00:41.870+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Just CC him when he ult. He may be immune to damage but he is not immune to CC its just that if you got warwick ulted as tryndamere you can use your ult to get out of it alive. Hard CC will still destroy Tryndamere and i don't think there is a need for nerfs. If there is something that needs to be nerfed it would be his rage bar and passive which grants him free 35% crit chance and if you are lucky in lane at early levels u can crit your enemies to death which is kinda op.","replies":[{"poster":"DragonOfTheVoid","date":"2015-09-22T18:23:40.896+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"just cc him cos all champs have cc","replies":[{"poster":"BadLuckFollowsMe","date":"2015-09-22T22:23:11.766+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The odds of nobody on your team having cc is basically zero.\nIf he picks after you and picks trynd, your team should be helping you with it.\nIf you pick after him and don't take someone with cc, that's your problem.","replies":[{"poster":"DragonOfTheVoid","date":"2015-09-23T05:34:58.168+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"{{champion:122}} {{champion:86}} {{champion:41}} top lane picks {{champion:266}} {{champion:11jg picks {{champion:131}} {{champion:7}} {{champion:76}} mid lane {{champion:222}} {{champion:236}} {{champion:67}} adc {{champion:53}} {{champion:412}} {{champion:201}} sup all these champs will be in lane 9 out of 10 times as they are meta picks now if we look at the possible out comes we have about 4seconds of cc on about a 10 sec cd now for a tryind to ult he needs to get to about 300 hp 100 if you are good with him now in a team fight a sup will not remember to save cc for the tryind now to start the fight a champ must be a: court out b: forced c: cc now lets say the sup missis the tryind then he cant cc for 10 sec ok ok lets say you have a off meta pick hahahah and they have cc if they miss tryind will be fine lets say that there is a yi and a tryind both fed ether 1 can ko your team your team wont have enof cc to stop them and if you do the players in the game will not have the brain to do so as I have played tryind many times I was lets say 10 0 0 come 20 min the fest of my team all lets say 4 3 0 now im the most fed on my team yet the cc all goes on the adc mid or jg and a good tryind will only go in if a: all cc is used b: he knows that the enemy team are all nubs and wont cc him or c: he is so fed he can just 1v5","replies":[{"poster":"BadLuckFollowsMe","date":"2015-09-23T10:01:57.929+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"That entire argument, as hard as it was to read because that certainly wasn't English, entirely revolves around the Trynd getting fed, your team being useless, incorrect targeting of cc, or all the above.
