I hope it isn't you) failed to update the details with League, leading to errors, if my poor interpretation hasn't gotten in my way this time.\n\nThe problem I have is though, that is for EUW,** is the Google's DNS here the same as the one used in EUW?** I don't wanna randomly update my DNS to some random service I don't even know.","replies":[{"poster":"Blackthornvision","date":"2015-01-14T05:35:09.751+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"1.
