One doesn't get to dash all over the place and do a gigantic list of things because they are personally more skillful than another player of equal skill who plays a toon of more restricting kit, but because their champ fundamentally allows that to happen. \"Skill\" is about performing well with what you have, it's thus tied to performance and NOT spectacle or spam-ability; it's an EXTREMELY common misconception.\n\nYi has an incredibly simple and 1 dimensional kit, one that's put on quite a CD at that, and that's precisely where the difficulty is, to do well despite his incredibly 1 dimensional and very restricting kit that has absolutely nothing in it besides a potential to be god himself if he could manage to pick up kills after kills with his terrible base, utter predictability, 0 flexibility, and almost non-existent survivalibility (though W is very solid for jungle sustain, but that's about it, during combat with other players it's just a parry, one that's on 35 second CD).\n\nTo call his kit \"simple\" is sound, but a better word is that his kit is \"handicapped\". He has 0 utility and almost 0 flexibility in his kit, there is no surprise from his kit on an innate scale, there is no bounce back and there is no recovery from bad mistakes. When he does something he has no other option than doing it right in 1 go, otherwise he's fked in the asshole and it would only get worse from there. And I will stress once more, unlike assassins who at least have good damage base to compensate for their similar attributes, Yi does NOT have the said good damage base because he's a late-bloomer champ (Yi is also generally referred as the \"fake assassin\" for this reason as Riot labels him so when he's really not one).\n\nHe therefore needs more game knowledge, positioning skills and game sense than their opponent in order to perform better than them in compensation for his handicapped kit. So whatever Yi is, he is NOT \"no skill\".\n\nThere is a reason why Yi is almost exclusively used to destroy newbies and low elo in this game and is almost never seen in other places. Because Yi requires either the opponent to be so bad Yi could freely snowball out of control, or that the Yi player is so good than their opponent Yi can snowball despite having flaws, bad early and exploitable weaknesses painted all over his face; and we all know how realistically plausible the latter scenario is.\n\nFace it, Yi might not need skill to comprehend, he still needs skill to perform well in any environment of reasonable skill level, and an abnormal amount of it once we get to high level plays. He is NOT \"no skill\".\n\n.................\n\nI am not sure if the analogy is perfectly sound, but here's an attempt: A fighter who only has 1 arm that somehow manages to fight on equal ground with others is not \"no skill\" because he only has 1 arm as opposed to 2. It doesn't work like that.","replies":[{"poster":"YellowBrickRoad","date":"2017-02-24T09:45:09.341+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"\"Yi has an incredibly simple and 1 dimensional kit, one that's put on quite a CD at that, and that's precisely where the difficulty is, to do well despite his incredibly 1 dimensional and very restricting kit that has absolutely nothing in it besides a potential to be god himself if he could manage to pick up kills after kills with his terrible base, utter predictability, 0 flexibility, and almost non-existent survivalibility (though W is very solid for jungle sustain, but that's about it, during combat with other players it's just a parry, one that's on 35 second CD).\"\n\nThis right here, and everything else, but mostly this.\n\nIs exactly why yi doesnt take skill.\n\nNotice in my post i said \"yi's only skills are basic generic skills like positioning\" (granted im paraphrasing but apparently you didnt get that the first time)\n\nhe isnt more skillful because hes restricted, rather he relies on generic skills more.\n\nFor example if you cant tell by the name i mained singed for quite a few seasons.\n\nlet me tell you right now, singed is not a skillful champion, compared to ap ez or akali singed is a complete snore fest to me, so why do i still play him if he mechanically has the skill level of a potato?\n\nHe requires above average map presence, you have to know when to proxy, where to go to minimise your chances of dying and waste the most time while proxying.\n\nYou have to be able to coordinate a team to have them take advantage of that 2 minute benny hill style chase through jungle by pushing out that bot lane that wont get ganked any time soon.\n\nBut neither of those skills are because the champion requires skill to play.\n\nRather you should have those skills on every champion, they just get demonstrated more by singed.\n\nSame thing with yi, he has no unique applicable skill, his kit doesnt require skill, but that doesnt mean you can get away with no generic skill.\n\nAt the same time just because a champion requires generic skill that all champions require doesnt mean it takes skill to play.\n\nWhich is why i mentioned earlier that if you are good at all the skills required to play yi, and then ALSO have even a shred of mechanical ability, you will be more useful on a more mechanically able champion than yi, simply because you have more capacity to well do things.\n\nIf you arent more useful on a more mechanically challenging champion, then sorry to say this, but the reason you are better with yi is your mechanics are bad, which results in more mechanically challenging champions holding you back.\n\nAlso to reply to your analogy.\n\n______\n\n\nA fighter that only has 1 arm that can beat someone with 2 arms doesn't necessarily have more skill.\n\nAfter all, the reason the fighter with one arm won wasn't because he was some amazing god of boxing, he won because he only had to master one punch instead of two, half the required skills to learn means you can put in twice the effort for the other half. if you were to suddenly give him back his other arm he would not magically be better than he was before, as his form with that arm would be that of a beginners.\n\nSame thing with yi, because you dont have any mechanics to learn, you get to put more time into practicing generic skills like positioning, that does NOT mean that you are good with mechanical champs as well by default.\n\nThe main misconception going on here, is that restriction somehow translates into skill for you.\n\nLets use another example of a restriction to drive the point home that that does not equal skill.\n\nLets take an arpegio played on a 6 string guitar.\n\nAnd an arpegio played on a guitar with only one string.\n\nthe 6 string guitar requires the dexterity in the strumming hand to individually pick out and mute strings as the pattern is played.\n\nThe one string version only has to pick and mute one string.\n\nThe 6 string version can stay in the same general location of the neck with the left hand.\n\nThe one string version has to move slightly more than normal.\n\nOverall the one string version is easier to play as the resulting difficulty increase with the fretting  hand is not greater than the difficulty increase on the strumming hand.","replies":[{"poster":"SEKAI","date":"2017-02-24T09:57:49.512+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yi doesn't punch harder by default as the 1 arm fighter, he only counter and punishes harder, as being a late game carry Yi has terrible early game and a severe lack of utility. Similar to the story of the 1 armed fighter, he is handicapped by default nor does he have the innate god-send superpower of defeating foes with 1 punch, if anything the only gift he has is better muscle reflexes so for him he has it better in terms of locking opponents down if he can locate weak-spots and openings for him to exploit on the opponent, but otherwise he has to be so superior in the basics than the others they have no trouble using it to override their disadvantaged self in order to face the others who innately are more flexible (as in flexible on utility and options) than him will ever be.\n\nOne can make the argument that Yi is easy to use in low elo because people there don't have the necessary experience to fully utilise the advantages of other much bigger kits and simple kits are more direct and easier to access. But in the highest level of skill, assuming the game is balanaced, the easy champ ARE the hard ones for the reasons the analogy touches on. Because there, straightforward-ness is a not a perk but a handicap, and no one wants that there.\n\nThus on an objective level, as it is and should only be determined in the highest level of play, or somewhere relatively close to it, Yi thus takes skill as a champion as a whole.\n\nEDIT: Though it would seem you more or less get what I'm trying to say, it's just that we have slightly different definition of what \"skills\" contain. I consider everything needed to perform in the highest level a skill which also include what you would call the \"basic skills\" (they are not invalidated just because every champ uses it because different champ still have different requirement and emphasis on them in the first place), meanwhile you only label it a \"skill\" if it's to do with comboing and other in-built kit synergy management. They are all skills.\n\nEDIT2: But yes, overcoming and/or getting around the restriction imo IS a skill.\n\n.....................\n\nEDIT3: But whatever, we'll agree to disagree if this still doesn't sail.","replies":[{"poster":"YellowBrickRoad","date":"2017-02-24T11:28:34.732+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The issue is when i see \"X champion doesnt require skill\" i dont look at the total skills required to play.\n\nI cut out any and all generic skills and i break down what that specific champion needs.\n\nFor example, yi's kit requires no skill to execute.\n\nThe only skill in playing yi is good decision making, reflexes, and positioning.\n\nThose 3 skills when applied to any other champion also work but with the added requirement of needing a 4th measure of skill namely mechanical prowess based on the kit.\n\nTHAT is what people refer to when they say \"X champion requires Y amount of skill\" not the other 3 generic skills, that 4th mechanical prowess measurement.\n\nYou dont have to be lee sin to require skill.\n\nAnd you dont have to be yi to not require skill.\n\nBut no matter what, one champion will require more skill to play than another.\n\nAlso i get the distinct impression that when you hear no skill you actually hear \"a trained monkey could play it\"\n\nWhen in reality what they are saying is \"ridiculously easy to play at any and all levels of play due to lack of mechanical requirements\"\n\nAs an example annie.\n\nExtremely easy to play champion, does that mean anniebot is a bad player? no.

For a basic ability it is very powerful and as a targeted ability the no skill tag is very easy to put on it. \n> I think everyone can say they have felt cheated by that skill at some point or another.\n\nI used to believe that Alpha is probably too strong before I started maining Yi a bit either. Then I realised it's really not a problem at all tbph.\n\nIts range is actually not big, it's okay I suppose being more or less the same as ranged character's AA range, it just appears somewhat bigger because it goes about in-between targets and possibly going further than the initial target but again, anything beyond the first target is RNG which Yi would have very little control over and there is still a restraint on how far Yi can dash to (they changed it so that when Yi is on a target, there is an invisible circle around the current target which Yi can only go the target, by chance, given that it's also within the circle too).\n\nAlpha Strike has a pretty long CD for a normal spell, it's goes from 18 to 14 seconds CD from spell level 1 to 5 without CDR. And requires Yi to stick on a target to constantly AA them to reduce the CD (and think how fragile Yi is), and usually it's still not enough to use it more than once in any encounter unless 1) It's a really long skirmish that for whatever reason happens or 2) Yi killed people AFTER lvl6 which can give him the refresh.\n\nThen on top of it, sits Yi's mana problem. Yi's mana management is pretty hectic. He's one of the last few champs who actually still run OOM in late game unless he keeps a constant steady supply of blue buff (which he won't because other players will always take it from Yi from mid-game onwards). So outside of the CD, there is another layer that could prevent him from using it freely at his disposal; even when Yi can refresh his spells after kill, which is already some difficulty in its own without a headstart due to Yi's rather not-so-great base and having 0 CC whatsoever as he's a late-bloomer, he rather frequently runs out of mana too and so he can't use Q even if he manages to clear the CD problem.\n\nAnd wait, there is more, Yi is over-reliant on his Q, and it's a bad thing. Let me explain. Without Q, Yi really can't do anything practically (unless you count AA'ing, running around, a self-rooting heal-over-time as \"something\"). Now recall all of the gating Yi has in-between himself and using Q, and realise it's only half of the things he has to deal with. The other half is that his Q is both his:\n\n* Engage.\n* Trading tool.\n* Escape (though very situational, but beyond that he has 0 escape).\n* Burst (potential). and,\n* Chase tool/gapcloser.\n* Wave/jg clear.\n\nAnd thus unlike most champs who probably have individual spells to spread all of those perks across a couple of them, Yi has all of it within 1 single spell, meaning he can't have 1 of those things without completely sacrificing all of the other ones (mostly, since he has another trading tool, being his W, but the statement applies to everything else on that list) until Q's CD rounds back up, one that also has a few gatings to keep it under watch as previously discussed.\n\n..............\n\nI don't really think it's unfair. It might feel cheap at first glance, or when a Yi manages to be really ahead (but most things are broken when the character is ahead), but it's really not a problem imho.","replies":[]}]}]}
