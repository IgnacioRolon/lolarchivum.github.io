But it&#039;s sadly no longer the case.\n\nSure we can still just watch the friends&#039; matches instead, but still, having the panel back would be nice since it&#039;s like a TV with a couple channels and you can always look for the ones that tickle your fancy rather than being limited to whatever that goes on in your friend-list where you have no knowledge about the match-up until you&#039;ve already dived in. Not to mention, the public spectate is usually on 24/7 so whenever you wanna watch some games, you can; the same can&#039;t be said about your friend-list, as it&#039;s typically the case that they go down past 12 in the morning.\n\nSo can we please have that back?\n\nOr is it back on the new client, I haven&#039;t got around using it yet. What I&#039;m trying to get to is that the public spectating is a feature I really like and would like it to stay permanently on the League client.","replies":[{"poster":"Niji","date":"2017-01-16T04:19:02.867+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Spectate me bby","replies":[]},{"poster":"Slowdownn","date":"2017-01-16T01:49:36.807+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yessssssssssssssssssssssssss, please.","replies":[]}]}
