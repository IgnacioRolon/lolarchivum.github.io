SEKAI desu.\n\nI am here to inform you that studio Trigger&#039;s newest creation, \"Ninja Slayer From Animation\" is definitely  a fantastic addition to the anime media.\n\nMuch like Inferno Cop in both genre and art style, it&#039;s a gag anime in every sense of that word. Things are looking random, it&#039;s intentionally made to look bad and the premise/setting looks as generic as it gets initially. \n\n**But that DOES NOT mean the show is getting nowhere or is it boring!! Hell No.**\n\n* The characters move your hearts without moving their bodies very much (and I mean it, literally). \n* The musics are very important in this title and they&#039;re very well placed, thoroughly enjoyable and stay true to the theme of this show.\n* The story is actually there and decent, far exceeds anyone&#039;s expectations and more.\n* The fight scenes are very imaginative and intense (mostly) due to an added flavour of how a child would play with their anime plastic action figures, giving it a fresh and long lasting taste of awe.\n* It stays true to the source material, being a satire novel series.\n* And \"Ninja Slayer From Animation\" in general, just oozes uniqueness that stands itself out from the crowd, begging to be explored.\n\nIt is a very interesting anime underneath all the facade it put up with, I am looking forward to every episode when it&#039;s released.\n\nIt&#039;s a series of planned 26 episodes but each is only 14 minute long.\n\nThis show atm gets a,\n**Yeeart/10.**\n\nGo watch it, highly recommended.
