Even after some time I still can&#039;t remember and have trouble pinpointing this particular film on the vast database of google.\n\nFrom what I can remember the film contains a few things:\n\n1. It&#039;s a film mostly about teacher and student relationships.\n2. It&#039;s a film that discusses racism, where the teacher is a white male while his students are all black, I think. I forgot what the exact setting was though, I think it was either middle or high school set in one of the poorer towns in US or something.\n3. I remember one of the kids has asthma, which the symptom triggered several times during the film and he is slightly bigger/obese than everyone else.\n4. I remember there was a scene where the teacher brought the kids to a pizza place.\n5. I remember one of the scene was the teacher visiting a student&#039;s home and wonder why they don&#039;t have chairs in the house as everyone was just sitting on the floor, which they replied that \"it would be safer if they lived under the windows&#039; height\" or something along those lines.\n6. I also remember the film was either centric around or just has football/soccer in it. But don&#039;t quote me on this dot point, I am not really sure myself as well.\n\nAny idea on what the film might be? Any help would be appreciated.\n\nThanks.","replies":[]}
