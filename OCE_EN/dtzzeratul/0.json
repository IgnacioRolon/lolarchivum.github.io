So, new 10 champions banned, and 10 champions played.\r\nso now we have 40 champions banned for the 3rd game. we are gonna start seeing some weird choices already.\r\nBy the 5th game, the champion pool would be reduced from 134 to 54(20each game x4 games)\r\nand then on the 5th game, it would be really weird champ selection, but probably a lot of fun.\r\n\r\nwhat do you guys think of it?","replies":[{"poster":"SeenByTheSea","date":"2017-05-14T23:24:34.902+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I love this idea, and it would probably make me interested in watching pro league matches.\n\nI currently do not, at all, I read the patch notes, everytime they come out and pay pretty close attention to the PBE, but I do see the pattern of a certain champs being buffed and others nerf before Worlds every year, Lee Sin is the one I notice always gets buffed before worlds ._.\nThen it's other high skill cap champs that can be played in exciting ways (which just don't seem all that exciting anymore when you see the champ in every second or so game for the next 3 patches).","replies":[]},{"poster":"Lord Sesshomaru","date":"2017-05-11T05:50:53.185+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> \"it would be nice to see some different champions been played\", like ... yasuo\n\nWash your mouth out son!\n____\n\nBut I think it's a neat idea, theres a bit more strategy involved too.\n\n_\"Do I play may mains in the first couple of games, and be guaranteed to get them? Or do I save them for later, where the enemy is playing champs they don't know, but I risk them being banned or played by someone else in the meantime.\"_\n\n_\"Do we use wombo-combo teams straight off the bat, stopping the enemy from getting them, and steamrolling the first few games, and then take our chances for the later ones? Or do we use our best champions first, and then save less-played wombo champs for later?\"_\n\nI think it'd certainly make games far more interesting, maybe even seeing some off-meta builds on champs!\n\nAs it is today, theres only really about 30 champions that are even considered in competitions like worlds and MSI, they vary mildly from season to season, but theres always Lee and Karma and those other always-meta champs. \n\nand not only does it flood our lower-level games with the same champs from pro-wannabes just copying whatever champs/builds the pros do. But it actually makes watching the games more boring. The banning phase is just fighting over who gets Ivern or Syndra again, the game itself is just Lee stealing all the buffs again. Late game is just Ezreal vs Jhin again. Theres little point watching, it's just the same champs being used again and again by different people. \n\nFor a game that has nearly 140 champs its pretty fuckin sad tbh.","replies":[]}]}
