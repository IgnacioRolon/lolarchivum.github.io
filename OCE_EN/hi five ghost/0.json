Not sure if it was hacked or banned (not sure why I&#039;m not as toxic as I was in silver 3 years ago). Yesterday I went to log in to play some poro king goodness and my password wasn&#039;t working. I&#039;m the type who only uses a set few amount of passwords. I like to keep it simple so it&#039;s impossible for me to actually forget any of them. So my immediate response is I was hacked I think... not sure why someone would bother, although the account is an old one since season 1 (shout out to those bronze season 1 cup bois). The account is worth a lot so I would like it back but I don&#039;t seem to be receiving the emails for the forgot your password thing. I&#039;ve submitted a support ticket but being Christmas  I doubt it&#039;ll be sorted. Just wondering if anyone else woke up one morning with the same issue or if anyone is receiving those emails and it&#039;s something on my end.","replies":[{"poster":"Deep Terror Nami","date":"2015-12-24T02:34:02.301+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Did you make sure to check your spam folder for the recovery email?","replies":[{"poster":"Hi Five Ghost","date":"2015-12-24T02:37:27.783+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yeah I did.
