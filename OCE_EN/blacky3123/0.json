Can there be a way for new people to be only matched with new people and smurfs with smurfs?????","replies":[{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2017-08-10T01:09:12.214+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Population and MMR are not your friends here, especially if you are playing in normals, since the vast majority of actual new players stick to bots for a good while.\n\nThe pop on OCE means there are very few actual noobs playing at any one time, so chances are you are almost always going to have one or two smurfs in a game.\n\nIf you are playing with your friend on you main account, then you are dragging his (and therefore your combined) MMR up drastically, so you are naturally going to be vsing people much closer to your skill than his. Best chance you have is to create a new account (or a couple for when your MMR catches up).\n\nBefore you get too upset, remember that as frustrating as it is to have smurfs on the enemy team when you are trying to teach a new player, to some, YOU will be that smurf on the other team that is stomping them at every turn.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Easley","date":"2017-08-10T00:37:21.897+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"if ur playing with him then that screws his mmr. let him queue solo and it'll stabilise over time","replies":[]},{"poster":"TimingOfLords","date":"2017-08-09T16:51:26.782+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"When I was first learning to play, I would only play Vs. AI because I was too afraid of getting my ass handed to me by smurfs. This was around the time of {{champion:7}} being able to deal 3K damage in 0.5sec with 4 ROAs, a DFG, and Sorc Shoes. So it was a pretty terrifying time to learn to play. I also didn't have the privilege of having someone teach me to play the game.\n\nThis has been an issue for years. Many of my friends were bullied out of the game by smurfs because people forget that everyone needed to learn how to play the game at some point. \n\nUnfortunately, there's not much that can be done. Most of the time you just have to take it as a learning experience. Try to encourage your friend to understand why they got destroyed by the smurf (such as positioning errors, minion mechanics, mechanical mistakes, getting outplayed, etc.) instead of \"Oh man, he's a smurf. Nothing you can do about that. This is a lost game\" or anything of the like.\n\nAs cheesy as it sounds, encouraging a positive mentality can help make the game seem better and really help a person's ability to improve at the game.","replies":[]},{"poster":"HaveYouSeenMyCat","date":"2017-08-08T12:27:50.739+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"yea they have a system in place now where if you are playing like a smurf (stomping every game) you will be placed with other smurfs, but even with this you are always going to go up against smurfs since there's not a whole lot they can do about it, frustrating ik.","replies":[]}]}
