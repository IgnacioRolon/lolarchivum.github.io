So I play a lot of normal (Basically only thing I play) and I&#039;m so sick of the people who join late, call their favourite roll and insta lock. 95% of the time, the guy who has already called top before the late-joiner isn&#039;t  going to change. The guy who joined late has already locked in the Master Yi top saying he&#039;s the best Yi Oce, and I don&#039;t enjoy going into games knowing that someone is arguing before the game has even begun. I hope that this new champ select in S6 will help this, because I&#039;m getting dodging bans daily because I don&#039;t want to go into a game with 2 top laners and the ADC is alone bot because these kids won&#039;t work out something. It&#039;s so unfair and if it&#039;s done to someone who isn&#039;t very viable with other roles, it&#039;ll cause a huge argument. There should be a way to report people in champ select or something because if someone dodges I can&#039;t report them for trolling, unless I get into another game with them and no one dodges to these inconsiderate kids who don&#039;t care about the other players. It seems like no one in Normals can be a decent human being for the 20-45 minutes they&#039;ll need to spend with each other. There should be a section in the reporting system for &#039;Champ select troll&#039;. I guess that kind of comes down in griefing but it&#039;s not specific enough. I&#039;ve been searching for a Normals game for like 20 minutes now because everyone keeps locking roles they didn&#039;t call first. Please Rito, add something that can detect and remove these champ select trolls because you can&#039;t stop them, asking them nicely wont help because they&#039;re selfish. The only way to have a normal game with one of these kids is for asking the guy who called first to swap, which 90% of the time they wont do because they didn&#039;t call top to be placed in support because of a troll. Draft mode in normal could also fix this, but I guess people may still pick the role they want and make the excuse \"it's just normal bro\"","replies":[{"poster":"CHEESYLEEKS","date":"2015-12-30T07:26:38.055+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"First normal I played in age two people fight over mid the games starts zeds now the adc , get to top to find out there's a duo top then our jungler goes afk and I was like  Back to ranked I go","replies":[]},{"poster":"Tele","date":"2015-12-29T22:09:57.898+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The real solution is Draft Pick Normals.
