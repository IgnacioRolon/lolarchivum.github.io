So I was just in a league of legends match as I normally am, and I came across a Rengar who was salty from the start of the game because our adc stole his krugs. Instead of just going and taking something else and getting lvl 2, he decides to feed everyones lanes. Now yes, I was toxic in this situation, but the enemy team all reported me (and not Rengar when he was feeding) for toxicity. Now this made me quite mad as I was only mad because he was feeding. Like at least report both of us, but no, just me. I&#039;m not sure if you&#039;ve noticed Riot but feeders usually don&#039;t get reported by the opposition as they&#039;re basically giving them a free win. On the other hand many games where I have encountered feeders have just ended up in my team getting reported for being salty in /all chat. I believe this is a huge problem as the guy who is actually fuelling the anger and ruining the experience, isn&#039;t getting reported. They never do, and they won&#039;t unless theirs a smart person on the opposition to think, maybe the guy feeding is making them mad. Now I know toxicity is against the terms of services etc. But, isn&#039;t feeding as well? I can almost guarantee half the player base would rather have a free win instead of a hard game where they possibly would lose. And the person who is doing the deed, who fuelled the flame, isn&#039;t being dealt with. The players are not enforcing the rules Riot. I&#039;ve dealt with these problems a lot, and I&#039;m sick of it now. I&#039;m not a game developer, but I know something about this should be done. Because we were both in the wrong, and my team were the only ones who got the punishment. I&#039;m not sure how you could fix this, and I don&#039;t know if other players feel the same but, this is just purely wrong and discouraging because most the player base just wants free wins and not the trollers/feeders gone. I know that the team who was on the feeders team usually report him but, will 4 reports really trigger something? Is it really worth reporting them? Because out of the 5-6 months I&#039;ve been playing league, only 2 times I&#039;ve actually made a change to someone with the reporting system.","replies":[{"poster":"LemonHunter","date":"2015-12-21T23:54:56.553+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"It's always worth reporting them if they are feeding etc. \n\nI know this sounds difficult to do, especially when you have just committed your own time to playing the game only to have it ruined by someone else, but I strongly suggest you keep toxic behaviour out of all chat at the very least. You really should not get toxic at all, but by saying it in all chat helps no one. By all means, 100% ask the other team nicely to report the offending player at the end of the match for intentionally feeding and leave it at that. By getting angry in all chat, all you are doing is annoying the other team, who will end up reporting you.\n\nI'm not sure how the system works on the back end, perhaps a Red may shed some light on it for you, but I do know that you will only get a notification if you were in the last game where someone was punished. You have probably helped get a lot of offending players punished, but just haven't received direct feedback in regards to it. I for one would love to have feedback for every player we report if they get punished, hopefully Riot bring this in in the future.\n\nIt can be hard in the heat of it all, but if you try to keep a level head, make sure you report the offending player and politely ask the rest of the players to report them as well (remember to not use unneeded language etc) then you will not be reported and the system can pick up and punish the offending player.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Project Xayah","date":"2015-12-22T02:14:18.002+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> I believe this is a huge problem as the guy who is actually fuelling the anger and ruining the experience, isn't getting reported.\n\nSo basically what you're saying is that *you* **never** report these kinds of players? Which actually makes you part of the problem for not bringing said players to Riot's attention so Riot can give just punishment.\n\nAlso, I would like to point out that toxicity does not solve toxicity. There is literally 0 reason to be toxic because someone else is being toxic, it just creates more problems.\n\nNot only are you part of the problem you are complaining about, you're also part of other problems within the community.\n\n>  I know that the team who was on the feeders team usually report him but, will 4 reports really trigger something? Is it really worth reporting them?\n\nYes and yes. The only way they will be dealt with is if Riot is made aware of their rule breaking, and it's not like Riot closely monitor *every single game* for this kind of behaviour, it would be completely impractical to do so. They rely on players taking the 1-2 seconds it takes to report disruptive players.\n\n> Because out of the 5-6 months I've been playing league, only 2 times I've actually made a change to someone with the reporting system.\n\nThere is literally no way you could possibly know this is the case.","replies":[]}]}
