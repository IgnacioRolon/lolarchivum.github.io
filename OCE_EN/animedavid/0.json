So I restarted the client and I could log in no more. I was using youtube and everything just fine, so i assume it wasn&#039;t the internet problem. So i went to restarted my computer and still couldn&#039;t log in into the game. I had to ran down restarted the modem and restarted the comp one more time. After reconnecting to the game, the game was fairly even and in the end we won, and this popped up. Like seriousily? Not like i wanted to leave or afk, I came back to play the game and we won aswell. No one told me off for it aswell and look at that.","replies":[]}
