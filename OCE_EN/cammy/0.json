It started the 20th November for me. I had to stop playing mostly but a few days ago I tried to log in and the launcher wouldn't even open because of some error. I uninstalled the game to try and re-download it to see if that worked but now I cant redownload it due to some error from the site when I hit the download button. I've rung tpg and they see that there has been a problem and was told it would be fixed soon","replies":[]}]}
