They seemed to be having fun all together but after a couple of minutes, they started doing some strange things. Such as: walking into turret and blaming for no follow-up, burning flash at base for no reason, and a tendency to call me names. They haven&#039;t been grouping at all so I decided that I should ping them to let them know that we are grouping because they only had nexus left. They weren&#039;t listening so I decided to let them know we can go for baron since only 1 of the enemies were alive. They decided to all back and split push the turrets and leave the mid lane wide open with no towers. I may have pinged a couple of times, but after a bit, they started cussing at me to shut up and f off. I really didn&#039;t like this game at all after that because I knew what was going to happen. One team fight later, we all got aced and they won. In the after game they wanted to report me, and the enemy team were saying that there isn&#039;t really a need to report someone for pinging. After i left the game chat, I got a warning for using excessive language. Premade groups are an easy way to ruin another player&#039;s game. For example, they didn&#039;t like one of their teammates, so they decide to report him for something that he didn&#039;t do at all. And then the player gets a ban or a warning for &quot;playing bad&quot; as they call it, even it was a first time using the champ or practicing. After all, it is a normal game.","replies":[{"poster":"wonkey donkey","date":"2016-01-27T10:19:53.972+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"maybe if you didn't cry and complain so much you would have some friends to play with mate","replies":[]}]}
