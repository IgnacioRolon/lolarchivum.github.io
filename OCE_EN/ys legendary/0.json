The account was elo-boosted in 2016 and the ban looks to result from more recent actions taken by those your account was shared with for the 2016 boost. As this ban is a result of account sharing, the ban will not be removed, especially considering it was shared for the purpose of boosting.\n\nThis is why we do not allow account sharing, you never know what the person you're sharing your account with is going to do with it.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"VirtualRio2","date":"2017-05-24T08:24:11.782+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I also have an account that i can not access anymore, im not sure if it was a ban or not, it just doesnt let me login into my account as a whole.

Riot reserve the right to ban any account for any or no reason, as stated in the [TOU](http://oce.leagueoflegends.com/en/legal/termsofuse) and [EULA](http://oce.leagueoflegends.com/en/legal/eula) (both of which you would have *had* to agree to to be playing the game legally).\n\n> I am sure that I never used the 3rd party software.\n\nSomething to consider is that it's not just to do with scripts, macros, hacks etc. \"aesthetic mods\", such as skin, map, announcer, voice over etc. mods, can also trigger the system, resulting in what may seem like an unwarranted 3rd party software ban. The use of any kind of aesthetic modifications has always been considered \"use at your own risk\" by Riot.\n\nFrom what I've seen there have also been certain other programs that will trigger the system without directly influencing or modifying the game/client, so it's possible something like that has happened.\n\nTo put it simply, though, the only chance you have of getting the account unbanned is by contacting [Riot support](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us), though they tend not to reverse bans when it comes to 3rd party software offences.","replies":[{"poster":"Talon12","date":"2017-05-18T09:59:53.215+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"even if it is a firewall issue concerning an antivirus, apparently good safety definitions are a big nono.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Ys Legendary","date":"2017-05-20T06:33:28.604+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Yep, I  contact to them, but they are too rude.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Roguestoney","date":"2017-05-17T23:03:11.538+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Support.","replies":[]}]}
