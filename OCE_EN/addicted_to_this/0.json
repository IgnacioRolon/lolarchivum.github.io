Have played games most of my life and i thought i would tell you why i like this game and give some of my thoughts on how to do pro shit and generally be good at the game.\r\n\r\nOf all the games iv'e played this is the one that has engrossed me the most. I was brought up on Counter-Strike, Diablo and various MMORPGs and i am happy to continue my game/brain training on LoL.\r\n\r\nI can play one hero for hours on end and if i get bored then i can play a new one and it is like a new game. \r\nIt is unreasonably time consuming but not because you need to grind better gear or more gold and other boring shit; time consuming  because you have to get more and more *skilled* at it to reach higher ranks and unlock a greater level of play. This is good. This is very very good. It keeps your mind sharp because gameplay is always changing and you don't feel like you're working for better content. \r\n\r\nMy Tips: \r\nMute All in normal/ranked - As long as you're not very high rank. \r\nDo what you know is best; don't listen to the guy giving orders if you think it's wrong.\r\nIf you're team goes in to fight and you know that the fight is lost regardless if you go in with your team: Then don't go in\r\nBe selfish and bait your team and carry if you can = If you win, They win. \r\nBe kind to your team mates, tell them they are amazing and you love them and they are very special people. \r\nHave a 10-15 minute break between games - When ever i get my ban of 20 min wait times before games i usually do better in them. \r\n\r\nBeing pro at games is almost like Lucid dreaming. You have to keep your emotions steady and mind focused and If you start getting excited and having strong emotions you will make a mistake and loose(wakeup). Playing CS taught me to stay focused and calm after i did some pro shit because in the next 0-10 seconds i'm going to have to do some more pro shit. If i get all proud and excited and my heart starts pumping because i killed one or two guys then i won't be able to kill the other 3. Same goes if i'm raging, if i rage i will just loose and loose and loose. And it's the same thing for LoL. So what i'm saying here is if you want to be pro then deny your feelings regardless of what happens. Just stay focused is all. \r\n\r\nCounterstrike is a simpler game and the action is pretty constant and you have more chances to do pro shit. \r\nLoL is more detailed and thoughtful then CS and you will face your trials to do something pro in a much shorter amount of time and in these bursts of action it's harder to be focused and calm then when the action is constant. \r\n\r\nSay i'm in bottom left jungle as Talon waiting for a team fight to pop off in mid and i'm trying to get into position so i can achieve my current goal as an assassin: killing or highly damaging soft targets fast and escaping.\r\nI'm running in the jungle(not sure if warded) parallel to my team who is pushing up mid and I have to get into a position suitable for me to safely kill the squishy as fast as possible in order to stop them from doing lots of damage or cc. I'll be keeping an eye on the position of my team as a whole so i know if we are going to change plans and to see if we initiate. Ill be watching the squishy i want to kill, let's say it's caitlin, and ill be checking if she becomes out of position before team fight starts, where her team is in relation to her, Ill be checking her and her teams Items, taking note of important cool downs,I'll be taking note of who goes into jungle and into shroud because they won't be present if team fight kicks off and they may surprise attack and this is just the shit i think about before the fight starts and now i'm in good position, behind enemy team and waiting for my team to initiate, or do i initiate? do i kill a squish before fight starts? i'm thinking this shit THEN FUCKING  MALPHITE SCREAMS OUT OF THE FUCKING JUNGLE AND SMASHES INTO MY FRONT LINE AND THERES FLASHING AND NOISE AND AoE ULTIMATES GOING OFF AND YOUR ADC IS GETTING JUMPED ON BUT HE'S A PRO SO I DONT WORRY BUT THEN A TEAM MATE DIES AND YOUR TANKS AT HALF HP... and this is all in about 10-20 seconds you know? \r\n\r\nIt's not just about smashing heads in this game, it's about organising, preparation, prioritising and lots of thinking stuff, you do all this stuff so when you go to make a play you are more likely to pull it off. \r\n\r\nCounterstrike taught me that if i started raging and getting upset then i would loose round after round until i started enjoying it again or if i had a break. \r\nWhen i was very good at counter-strike i didn't get excited when i would get headshot after head shot after headshot and kill half their team in one round and continuously top scoreboards, it was just what i expected; but then i got skill capped, didn't have time to get better, not fun anymore, good bye CS. \r\n\r\nI think a conclusion to this is to say if you want to be really good at this game then you have to deny your feelings and just become a  calculator. It's possible to figure out how to be the best at this game if you have the time to sit down and think about it.","replies":[{"poster":"TouchMyKimchi","date":"2015-03-25T10:28:40.201+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I lelled at the CAPS part.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Sackboy","date":"2015-03-25T05:23:49.165+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"tl;dr please","replies":[]}]}
