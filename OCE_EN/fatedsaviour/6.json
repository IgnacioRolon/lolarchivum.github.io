Well it is my oppion too that only bronzies think he is OP. \n\nAfter all, how can bronze handle him, if the adc come out of laning phase at 10mins with 50-60cs; and most likely having a 170cs count for a 40mins game. \n\nDarius is not S tier or even A tier, but you bronze just make him look good, cause it hard to cs down there to buy any thing good, or even have a optimal items build. Hence the whole poll = Only OP in bronze. Where darius early game power spike never really going away cause alots of bronze cant get enough items to get out of it.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Blamzite","date":"2017-06-03T14:25:55.631+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Executioners calling {{item:3123}} = ded darius","replies":[]},{"poster":"Fitzky","date":"2017-06-03T13:19:10.498+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Play swain and you've won the lane","replies":[]},{"poster":"TheDemonEmperor","date":"2017-06-03T12:52:35.608+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Those 3 that voted 10 = 3 nasus main.","replies":[]}]}
