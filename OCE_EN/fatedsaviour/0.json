Most commonly seen in the recent influx of lux players going full ap lux no support item, so here is my statement. EXHAUST DOES NOT MAKE YOU A SUPPORT. taking a support item and even teleport works as a support, and please answer me this while im at it, why take ignite as a support *oh but then they get less heal and its not for ks* if so why not have support take heal and adc take ignite\r\n\r\nsecond argument, just because im the support, doesnt mean i cant be in command, or in situations of some flame&#039;y adc&#039;s, right. more adc&#039;s should hear this. Supports can become in charge if situations hold, i have had many a game of this recently where the adc understood about my early engage power, and they agree to go along with my early plan at least once, and if i suceed they trust me and follow my lead, if i fail i follow the adc, knowing if the support can take command can tell u who decides wether to fall back from a gank, engage, etc.\r\n\r\nmy final argument. this argument isnt as big but i would like to ask two things, one, how many off meta support feel so effective they should be meta, and who do you prefer as a support, sion or leona","replies":[{"poster":"shdwzone","date":"2017-02-08T02:32:38.101+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Ok so , something you have to remember here is that they are only supporting you through the laning phase and peeling for you through out the rest of the game ( they will do this for other players also and they should do the same for you.. ie: teamwork ), so let use your lux example , has slow,snare good poke and a shield for you and good dmg..... imo they should at least buy sightstone apart from that lux is fine. \n\nAs for summoner spells id prefer them to have {{summoner:3}}  but they can really run what ever they like,  really you are trying to win the lane to help get map control to then win the game so even if they take {{summoner:14}} and are getting the kills its not the end of the world, as they are actually going to build dmg and do dmg , not like a full tank build sup that may never die they arnt going to be able to do much with those kills as u wont have the dmg to follow it up early.\n\nas for lane control , before the game even begins im asking my adc or sup if they want to play def or aggressive and base my picks off enemy champ select and my team picks and how they wanna play the lane , as a supp you can make the calls if your a champ with snares and stuns so your adc know when u are going for cc, the adc can do the same if they know they have the dmg to win at certain lvs and call targets for you to lock down or tank. so both adc and sup can call the lane its just you have to be open to communicate.","replies":[{"poster":"FatedSaviour","date":"2017-02-08T02:36:56.113+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"i thought i communicated with my adc well, u bring it to another level, and lol i almost never take exhaust as support sion, always tp XD, FACE FOR LIFE, still tho, this is how the adc's should think of us, not the person to blame when they cant blame jungler","replies":[{"poster":"shdwzone","date":"2017-02-08T03:58:23.640+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Lol its not really another level , im just chill about it and I want to make it work so we have the best chance of winning even if we dont i always play to have fun and so far its work very well for me.\n\nYou should try {{summoner:3}} on sion another slow in the bot lane for you could make a big difference more CC should always be welcome.\n\nI personal think blaming others no matter what lane your playing in will do nothing to help, just leaves everyone agitated.\nDoes anyone think that yelling and cursing at the person trying to help you will make them want to help you anymore than they already are.\nBest way to solve this issues is if they are annoying you at all , just ask them to sit back and farm the lane  or just to chill and make sure they dont engage on the adc.  Also dont forget you have a mute button for the keyboard warriors who cant handle constructive criticism.

If you take ignite on support, unlike with midlaners where ignite is the finishing move, you need to know exactly when a fight is an all-in and then drop ignite immediately at the start of the fight, to prevent lifesteal or healing and also to reduce the chances that ignite will be the final tick since the kill is generally better off on the Adc.\n\nSupports who drop ignite as a finisher to ks are the worst, but ignite is definitely an option worth considering as a support, especially if the enemy team lacks mobile bruisers (if the enemy team has irelia, jax, riven or kled you'll probably need exhaust) and you are fairly confident you can preform during the early game with your support champ.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Barbarossa","date":"2017-02-07T22:04:12.786+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Lux is a viable bot support when you dont have an Ap in your team. and you can go full ap, Warding is team exercise.","replies":[{"poster":"FatedSaviour","date":"2017-02-08T02:00:46.631+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"with full ap lux, idc what ur full ap build is, as long as u get support item during laning phase, and if we request it, a redemption","replies":[{"poster":"Nightjar","date":"2017-02-08T03:18:38.918+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"although arguably as a someone who sometimes plays tank toplaner, if we're lacking in the AP department and the only ap we have is lux for the teamcomp (low elo teamcomps are more often than not 100% AD), redemption is probably better off in my inventory.
