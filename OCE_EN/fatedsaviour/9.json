Halve \"Rush\" base cooldown.\n\nI loved playing Street Fighter (if you didn't played it, you didn't have a childhood), and I wanted to create a champion who is able to pull off large combos. Originally, I had an idea of a champion whose skills changed depending on the last skill used, similar to LeBlanc's ultimate. This meant it basically had 4 different skill sets and became very overloaded. I decided to cut down a bit and just have the combos as a passive.\n\nOverall, I think the kit is slightly overloaded. She's very mobile and able to stay alive for quite a bit due to her E, and can disengage quite easily with her Q + W. Alyce is designed as a very squishy, but agile champion, which does not hit very hard, but items such as BotRK might make her design a bit flawed. Right now, the problem about her kit, apart from being a bit overloaded, is that she doesn't seem to have much damage without her ult. I purposely lowered her attack damage and defensive stats to keep the \"fragile\" element in the champion, but that seems to dominate right now. I guess I could lower her ultimate's cooldown and damage, but I would like to hear your opinions first.\n\nAs with my other champion ideas, names are subject to change.\n\n**EDIT**: Formating\n**EDIT**: Value changes\n**EDIT**: Passive changes (ability empowerment)","replies":[{"poster":"Nightjar","date":"2017-04-05T14:29:00.054+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"this design looks pretty awesome, there is an issue with her kit synergising best with building tank rather than duelist or bruiser, and some of her combo requirements are pretty high. Also with her current system, her lane trading early levels is pretty horrendous. Maybe change the combo system, into something more like nunu rework passive, where having a certain amount of combo will allow her to use an empowered 'combo gated' version of the ability, a bit more like street fighter.\n\nHer passive, should probably not have the damage disabling combo, since she already has the requirement of staying in combat, and having her strength in sustained trades (more likely with a cleaver and bork) yanked out from her if she takes damage is probably a bad idea. Also capping her atkspeed at a different number than 2.5 is kind of pointless and will only lead to balance issues in the niche applications it provides. The movespeed and atkspeed stacking is cool, though the atkspeed needs to take longer to ramp up, and i'd\n\nI'd change her q cooldown to 10/8/6/5/4. Since triforce spamming, especially for splitpush does become a real possibility lategame and with cooldown reduction this might be a bit too powerful. However, since this is her bread and butter trading ability, it should be on a short enough cooldown earlygame to allow her to use it to trade. Maybe make the combo gate gives you the dash but otherwise this is just a two part auto enhancer.\n\nW looks epic and has nice synergy with rush. I like how it scales (sort of) off of crit with the slow-stun mechanic. Those numbers are a little high depending on cast time and given the fact this is a cc ability and that this ability can crit. Maybe cut the ad scaling to 30/40/50/75/90 + 40/60/90% bonus ad, and make it combo gated for a guaranteed crit.\n\nE has a nice design but 60s at rank 1 and a high combo gate? Maybe change it so that this ability, allows her to dash back to an allied champion or minion and gives them a +20% movespeed bonus towards enemy champions (a mini righteous glory). I'd say a fair cooldown is 20/18/16 and have the combo gate change the movespeed bonus to +30% movespeed in any direction and applies to Alyce as well.\n\nI'd say her ult in that kit you've described is kind of counter intuitive, since it both consumes her stacks (shutting off her other abilities) and is only damage. I'd think it would make more sense if her ult reset her combo stacks but for the next 8s she empowers her autos and gives her a short lunge when autoing a new enemy champion who she hasn't lunged to in the last 4s, gives her attack speed and movespeed. Hence when she ults, she would need to quickly start autoing people to start 'comboing' off abilties, and also uses the short lunges to quickly dart around and reposition in a fight. With this ult she would be a decent bruiser/disruptor and would have some outplay potential, especially when paired with hard cc engage supports\n\nImo her base movement speed should also be 340 and her base atkspeed should be lower like 0.697 (the highest current lvl1 base atkspeed) at lvl1.\n\nWith these changes to her design, she'd be an efficient fighter toplaner and possibly jungler, who is designed to make use of hard extended trades. She would be decently strong earlygame, but lacks sustain and lategame she needs a proper tank like a leona or a nautilus to engage so that she can follow up. In teamfights she is designed to make use of movespeed and short dashes to reposition and weave in and out of a fight and cause disruption with her high aggressive mobility. \n\nShe has major tradeoffs when using her ult since it requires her to engage and stay in the fight to rebuild her combo bar, and she'd need her combo gated abilities to help gapclose since the lunge on her autos might not be enough to get to the backline. Hence if she engaged with combogated abilities, they'd be on cooldown which would make it more difficult to get in auto range during her ult duration, however if she could weave through the fight she can get more damage off. \nWhereas if she ults first, the abilties are available and can be quickly activated but she would need to quickly rebuild her combo to be able to make full use of her combogated abilities.\nOverall it would probably be better to burn the cooldowns and then ult if you have a tank disruptor to engage, but if you don't have someone else to engage, soak up cc and damage, and hold enemies in place, then ulting first before engaging might be a real consideration.\n\nI hope my suggestions haven't ruined your ideas for Alyce, she's an interesting champion design, I'd really like to see in league, and your kit is very creative, I'm just running through ideas that would seem more likely if she were ever released as an official champion.","replies":[{"poster":"ImJungling","date":"2017-04-07T01:12:13.128+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"A lot of great suggestions, thanks! I wanted to keep the ultimate as is, sort of as a finishing move, but I implemented your \"combo gate\" idea, so the ultimate isn't just flat damage. If possible, could you take another look at the *\"new\" abilities/values. I had the high E cooldown and minimum combo requirement as I thought it was a bit overpowered (Camille ult on Alyce, Alyce E onto minion, transferring ult etc.), but I nerfed it a bit, so \"tagged in\" doesn't last as long. I kept the \"damage disabling combo\" passive as 1/ keeping the \"street fighter\" theme constant and 2/ so you can't just rush at the enemy backline, but I lowered the timeframe to deal the damage to remove her combo stacks, so small bursts won't make her useless in fights.\n{{sticker:slayer-pantheon-thumbs}}","replies":[{"poster":"Nightjar","date":"2017-04-07T03:37:31.972+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"nice refinement there, I'd still say having a combo minimum on abilities would be harder to manage than you'd expect, since essentially, 5 combo is 5 autos before trading, 15 combo is 15 autos, 20 combo is 20 autos in a row. Combo would be hard to build up and it really would cripple her in lane. Empowered system gives incentive to build up combo when possible and is far easier to manage, but having minimum combo reqs for casting basic abilities, makes early laning hard, and if you fall behind, there is no way to try to comeback. Since you'd be zoned and would have no way to build up combo and so you'd be fighting without basic abilities which isn't really possible for a melee. I'd tone down the combo reqs alot, even for some of the empowered abilites.\n\nI think having a 5 combo requirement on her q is not really going to work out if she tries to play lane though. She's melee and so she's going to need to be able to dash and trade using her q in lane. Having her be forced to auto 5 times (which is alot in the earlygame) before using her ability is just not going to work for a q. Q is a champion's bread and butter, and shouldn't be so hard to setup. Also requiring stacks means that in a fight with no nearby minions, she has 0 engage, which is a bigger problem for a decently squishy melee fighter than you'd imagine, making her teamfight and lategame substantially worse. \n\nAlso movespeed scaling on a champion that has multiple movespeed steroids in their kit is probably unnecessary and a bit overloaded on her q (an ability with low lategame cooldown and decent scaling already). Q's should be simple but unique. They should be a champion's most accessible ability, with low mana cost and cooldown, average damage and maybe short mobility or effect.\n\nHaving her w reset her q cooldown would be too powerful in lane as it would make trading back against her impossible with the dash or even just the sheer number of auto resets this gives. The ability is fine enough as is, giving the ability guaranteed crit on being empowered also offers her options outside of crit builds (in champion design you want to encourage types of builds, not force them), although crit would understandably be better.\n\n\nAlso as much as you've tried to make your ult, not be just pure damage, right now it's not exactly very impactful and noticable, since it basically only a damage buff and armour debuff. For a champion the ult should be a dramatic and defining ability, armour shred and small amount of movespeed just isn't that amazing. As a brawler, I'd imagine a boxing type duck and weave through a teamfight with a lot of short bursts of mobility would be pretty cool thematically. \nFlat cooldown reduction of her q whilst ulting is kind of plain, armour shred probably isn't really very thematic either. The flat damage scaling with combo is interesting but kind of vanilla, and it doesn't really fit the idea of an overwhelming barrage. \n\nMaybe whilst ulting, her auto attacks on enemies reduce the cooldown of her q by 0.5s per auto, hence she would auto to get her q cooldown, q for the empowered autos, auto again which then shaves 1.5s off the cooldown if she can get up close and brawl enemies and she'd take around 1s to get this combo off. This cooldown shaving would also allow her to q again and just continue to 'rush and overwhelm' her enemies. This would force her to ult whilst in a fight and would allow her some really high tension outplay where she would duck and weave and try to dodge skillshots and constantly re-position. \nThis would also mean that her ult would be a way to facilitate short term hypermobility, and would allow her to convert her q (which is usually just gapclose and a slight auto enhancer) into a major source of damage as she will be able to use it many times (during an 8s window, she would be able to get around 6-7 empowered q combos off, with this change, movespeed scaling on her q would give her too much damage) in a short period of time. Essentially, overwhelm would be a rapid series of 'rush' attacks that would hit enemies with an overwhelming barrage.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"FatedSaviour","date":"2017-04-06T00:01:53.432+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"firstly, for some reason im only getting notified of your two posts now wtf lol, anyway, 1 i dont understand the ult per combo dmg, and i think it would be better to have combo as an empowering resource, and probs have a reasonable max","replies":[{"poster":"ImJungling","date":"2017-04-07T01:20:12.000+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"1/ Basically, the ult deals damage in 2 parts; the base damage and the combo damage. the combo damage = number of combo stacks multiplied by the AD scaling.

Has a weak lvl1 but has decent ranged farming with q, has a very good teamfight lategame.\n\nPassive - Life in Death\nKrask cannot auto attack, however every 12-7s krask gains a shield for 25-130 health when hit by an enemy champion, this shield cannot be proc'd by minions. Enemy champions damaged by Krask's abilities are marked with Krask's passive for 4s and allied champions who kill champions marked with Krask's passive are restored 40-80 (+40% bonus ad) health and 20-70 (+15% bonus AP) mana, this effect applies to champions who get an assist or kill on the enemy champion. This passive does not apply to minions and the restored hp and mana on an allied target is reduced by 60% for each subsequent enemy champion killed by an ally.\n\n>This passive is really useful during lategame teamfights as once you have a bit of ad and ap, the amount of sustain you offer in fights can really turn the tides.\n\nQ - Blight, 20 mana and 15hp, 300 range, 10s cooldown\nBlight can be cast on a single enemy minion or champions. When blight is cast on minions, if the minions is below 5%hp the minion is executed and refunds 90% of Blight's cooldown, otherwise the ability goes on cooldown with only 40% of it's cooldown refreshed. \nWhen Blight is cast on an enemy champion, it deals 10-40 (+ 30% bonus AD) magic damage + (15 + 1 per 50 AP)% of the damage they deal to Krask within the next 1s of being hit with Blight, this does not apply for the damage applied by spell or onhit effects. When cast on enemy champions this ability does not get any cooldown refreshed.\n\n>This ability is Krasks core ability to farm and trade in lane and acts as a substitute for his lack of auto attacks. This ability allows Krask to farm extrmeley effectively from a distance and when timed right with his shield allows him to trade quite well, however using this ability to trade does cripple his ability to farm in the short term, so enemies may decide to pressure Krask whilst he is farming and force him to use this ability to trade. The dual ratios of this ability works well with Gunblade and the amount of times Krask will need to cast this in lane, means that a tear of the goddess would be a good pickup. This ability works as extremely strong poke when played as support. This ability has a low mana cost and cooldown but because Krask uses this ability to farm, it quickly drains his mana and health pool.\n\nW - Unrelenting Growth, 80 mana and 5% of Krask's current hp per nearby minion, 600 range, 9s cooldown\nKrask infuses and reinforces nearby allied minions with his essence, granting them +5 baseAD (+10% of his Bonus AD and +5% of his bonus AP), 5% of his Bonus Armour for 3s and restoring 25% of their current missing health. Krask does not recieve gold for minions killed by his empowered minions nor participation in champion kills but does earn gold if they destroy a tower while they possses his bonus ad. This ability does NOT apply his passive.\n\n>If Krask needs push this is the ability to use, it has it's drawbacks and can get him to dangerously low hp and using this denies him of alot of farm but spamming this ability can overwhelm an enemy champion if they're too low to tank minion waves to get to the low hp Krask behind them. Since this ability costs current hp, it's a very good defensive tool when you're low hp to just end a fight and if timed with minion aggro it can be used to suprise and outrade alot of enemies. When used on a full minion wave this will cost around 30% of health per cast so use sparingly.\n\nE - Paralysis Bloom, 100-180 mana, 500 range, 14-10s cooldown\nParalysis Bloom is a slow moving projectile skillshot that applies a Bloom buff on enemies that lasts for 3s. When an enemy minion or epic monster dies with a a Bloom Buff, they explode in a short 120 unit radius dealing 20-50 (+ 40% AP ratio) physical damage and slowing neaby enemies hit by the explosion for 1s. When Paralysis Bloom hits an enemy champion the Bloom Buff will be applied and explodes when it expires and stuns the enemy champion but does not apply damage.\n\n>This ability can be cast on minions as ranged poke but it's high cooldown and mana cost encourage it to be used more to setup kills or during teamfights. The stun is also a setup ability and in the chaos of a teamfight can be very useful for applying some delayed cc on an assassin or for making a pick and preparing to catch an enemy squishy when they're re-positioning. A bit tricky to use but has a decent amount of potential. \n\nR - Stench of Doom, 160 mana, 350 range, 200-170-140s Cooldown\nKrask channels for 1.2s, he is able to move whilst channeling but is unable to cast abilities or use item actives and being stunned or silenced whilst channeling will cancel the channel and refund 50% of the cooldown, being put in stasis will also cancel the channel.\nAfter the 1.5s channel then explodes, literally dying in the process. He deals true damage in an AoE around himself when casting this ability, equal to 5% of his current hp to all enemies, heals all allies for the 110-200 (+80% Bonus AD and +40% AP), gives all nearby allies a +15% movespeed buff for 5s and he dies. This effect ignores revive effects such as Guardian Angel or Zilean's Chonoshift and ignores immunity effects such as Kayle, Kindred or Taric Ult. This death also gifts a kill to the enemy who last damaged or cc'd him within the last 13s.\n\n> I don't think I even have to explain why this ability is both amazing, hilarious and stupid. This ability takes some real decision making and positioning since when you use it, your team will be a man down, but if used at the right moment, the AoE damage and the healing from your ult+passive can basically turn any fight around, it also requires you to die when relatively healthy to get the most damage out.\n>\n>A doubled edged sword that truly tests the decision making of the user. This ability also has different impact depending on itemisation since in more damage oriented builds this will heal for alot, whereas as a tank this ability will do alot of damage. This ability will also screw your KDA. An interesting thing to do with a toplane build is to use your ult to execute yourself and deny the enemy team gold. This ability can also be horrible if a Alistair or Tristana knocks you away though.\n\nKrask is a low mobility, short range, control/support Bruiser champion. He has high mana costs and a weak earlygame but can be very impactful lategame. The champion itself is simple to play and has only one skillshot (though a pretty hard to land one) but requires good decision making because every single one of his abilities has drawbacks (q is needed to farm or trade, w costs alot of hp, e is very mana hungry and confusing and his ult will kill him). \n\nI don't think this champion design is very solid thematically though I think his passive Q and Ult are very interesting and a nice fit and he might be a little overtuned since he possess many mechanics that could become a problem if abused correctly. Looking over his numbers I think he might be a little too powerful since he has high base damages, decent scalings, average cooldowns and decent base numbers and alot of utility but I'm not sure and also his short range and lack of mobility or instant cc could keep him in check. He probably would also be a little confusing to play at first since the reliance on using q to last hit might be a little much, despite power of the waveclear it provides once he has max cdr. I'm afraid his abuse of cooldowns could make him very broken though.","replies":[{"poster":"FatedSaviour","date":"2017-03-03T04:47:06.249+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"im commenting this as im reading btw, firstly, why have 0 ad if the passive is he cant attack, makes it harder to scale his abilities\nQ, need some form of mana refund as well, and how about 1 sec before it hits them not after\nW, nice idea making minions do work, this could be immensly powerful, with tons of outplay potential, but extremely hard to use\nE, would be nice if it went through enemies with no explosion but some other kind of poke (like malzs E, but, not), and a good zoning ability if it could go through\nR, firstly, is it 1.5 or 1.2 sec channel, secondly, ALAH AHKBAR\nbut overall, interesting, but very confusing, didnt think the first champ posted here would be so, well thought through, a tri hybrid, of health, ap, and ad, and getting ad giving him good magic dmg, and ap good physical, and health giving him peel, Higher W costs, and true dmg, would be very flexible to build, you deserve an upvote","replies":[{"poster":"EzeBlood","date":"2017-03-06T01:21:54.444+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Can I just point out how counterintuitive that ult is to use though?

If Baldomar does not have enough \"Blood\" to activate his abilities, the 2*the missing \"Blood\" will be deducted from his health for the activation instead.\nDamaging minions +5 \"Blood\". Killing minions +15 \"Blood\". Damaging Champions/Epic monsters +10 \"Blood\". Killing Champions/Epic Monsters +50 \"Blood\"\n\n**Q: Blood Needle (skillshot)**\n30/25/20/15/10 Blood\n8/7/6/5/4 seconds\nBaldomar throws a needle made of blood, dealing damage. Killing a unit with \"Blood Needle\" refunds the cost, and restores additional 5/10/15/25/30 \"Blood\".\n\n**W: Blood Vial (trap)**\n60/70/80/90/100 Blood\nGain 1 charge every 30/25/20/15/10 seconds\n1 second\nBaldomar hides a glass vial of blood on the battlefield. Activating his Q or E while within 400 range of the vials cause the vials to burst, and the blood inside to shoot back to Baldomar, restoring \"Blood\" (equal to casting cost) and 12/25/40/55/70 HP. Enemies hit by the blood stream take 20/30/40/50/60 magic damage and are marked for his ultimate. Healing is increased by 20/40/60/80/100% for each enemy champion hit.\n\n**E:  Forge/Refine (self-buff)**\n100/90/80/70/60 Blood\n8/7/6/5/4 seconds\nEDIT: Cannot be cast after leaving combat\nForge: Baldomar forges a blade from blood, which lasts 3 auto attacks before breaking. While the blade is still active, Baldomar's auto attacks gain 20 range and 50AD.\nReforge (only castable if \"Forge\" is active): Baldomar reforges and refines his blade, refreshing it's durability and gains a stack of \"Refined\". Each stack further increases the blade's AD by 50. Can be stacked up to 10 times. Attack range further increases at 5 and 10 by 20. Further casts of \"Reforge\" only refreshes durability.\nEDIT: Blade loses \"Refined\" stacks every 15 seconds (NO MORE CHEAP EXPLOITS)\nUpon death, all stacks of \"Refined\" are lost.\n\n**R: (to be named*) (AOE damage and CC)**\nIncreases max \"Blood\" to 500. Baldomar causes the blood of his enemies in a target area to writhe painfully for 2 seconds, dealing 100/150/200 (+20%AP) magic damage, restoring 25/50/75 \"Blood\" for each enemy champion affected. Enemies marked by Baldomar's W are also stunned for the duration.\n\nBaldomar is a fighter/buiser who specializes in large battles (teamfights, middle of minion wave etc). Overall, I don't think his kit is too overloaded. His lack of mobility and CC in his basic abilities means that he is susceptible to early ganks if he pushes out too much. Similar to Nasus, to get the most damage, he needs stacks. As all \"Refined\" stacks are lost on death, and his dependence on the stacks, ganks are very important. If given a chance to snowball, be will snowball hard.\nI think that the passive is quite interesting, as you will have to eventually decide whether you want to spend health for your abilities. The only problem is that you can technically stay in fountain and spam your E to gain 10 stacks without much repercussion. I don't want to remove the way you can spend health in the middle of a fight to give an attack buff, but it still leaves the fountain + E problem. I'm open to suggestions.\nThe Q is quite straightforward. You use it to farm \"Blood\". It's a skillshot. Any questions?\nBaldomar's W is interesting, in the way that, while it is a trap (technically), it need to be manually set off. As it is Baldomar's only form of sustain, and empowers his ultimate, it will require careful positioning and planning, much more than traps which deal instant damage.\n\nOf course, all names are probably going to be changed.\n\n**EDIT**: Formating\n**EDIT**: Values added","replies":[{"poster":"FatedSaviour","date":"2017-04-06T00:04:16.316+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"seems wierd, but a coolish kit, turning a trade into further power, maybe a bit of clarity onto the numbers of blood gained so to know if farming is op or not XD, and i dont quite understand his E, could you simplify plz","replies":[{"poster":"ImJungling","date":"2017-04-07T00:22:39.775+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"So the E is split into 2 parts; the initial activation (Forge) and further activations (Refine).

When unleashed upon opposing champions, the spirit will circle around them a expose their position as they try to retreat out of sight or hide in bushes, increasing all damage dealt to the target enemy by 10% until destroyed. Should Diego cast the spell on himself, He will take three bottles from his belt and release three female spirits (each containing 80 hp each), who will circle around Diego increasing  the recharge of his health and mana by 3.5% and auto-attack enemies within melee range until destroyed.\n\nMana cost: 300\ncool down: 50 seconds\n\nR: \"the Taste that raises the Dead\"\n\nIf Diego is quick to react in wake of a dying allied champion, He will retrieve the small bottle dangling from his neck and pour a drop into a \"Golden mane\" whiskey bottle (taking about 4 seconds) before hurling it at the dead ally.
