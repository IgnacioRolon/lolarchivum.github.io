But most of the time they say these things unreasonably, or, where&#039;s the help. A lot of the time, they were nowhere near for the kill, they ignore your pings if u get vision, or they want help after diving into a 4v1 by flash dashing or some nonsense like that. I dont like to remove items from my build, and the only eye vision item that doesnt ruin your build is the one for tanks, and i&#039;d rather protect my allies from ganks, than prevent the gank itself, and if the support wards river all the time, then adc can ward 1 lane bush all the time. So what im discussing is, what are your scummy adc stories about when your playing support and they flame at you for no logical reason, or answer this poll (i forget a lot of adc&#039;s at the time as i usually see the same 4)","replies":[{"poster":"idiotic shell","date":"2016-11-21T00:47:09.232+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"what rank are you buddy?","replies":[{"poster":"Kommissarw","date":"2016-11-21T01:16:04.176+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"My 1st thought too.\n\nI climbed as support without wards until it was more regularly punished by the opponents.  As annoying as it is wasting gold on vision your ADC takes no notice of, as we rise, that becomes less of a problem.  I'm Silver4 in OCE for context.\n\nOP - my suggestion is ward for your own practice anyway.  It's true that warding won't protect you from all abuse, but it does some of the time.  When they abuse you anyway, sometimes an impartial teamate will recognise such toxic behavior & that definitely can help protect you.","replies":[{"poster":"FatedSaviour","date":"2016-11-21T23:29:57.367+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"the ward system is why i enjoy it when kali is adc XD, but with enough teamwork you can always have the river warded and 1 lane bush without a sightstone","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"FatedSaviour","date":"2016-11-21T01:07:33.958+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"should be silver, but due to unfortunate teammates and luck of the lane, bronze, but happens to me no matter where i go","replies":[{"poster":"JasonWazza","date":"2016-11-21T05:10:42.560+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"It has nothing to do with team mates.\n\nLack of playing any games, is 1 reason, the other being lack of presense most likely (if you ever have a KDA on a champion of less then 2, then look at yourself.)","replies":[{"poster":"FatedSaviour","date":"2016-11-21T23:30:44.993+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"how about when u dont get ganked when an enemy champion counters you early and you could've won lane easy if you couldve caught up, only because illaoi can 2v1, but she wasnt 6 yet and i haven't played any games yet because im waiting until i can hop on my good computer and will lag less, personal situation you dont need to know the details","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Hoaxi","date":"2016-11-21T05:05:53.414+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"t7 thresh main bronze and slowly climbing. I notice some days i'm on point and others i'm just not all there lol What i do know is that my map awareness is pretty damn good and i enjoy throwing out wards. It's hard solo queing though because at times i just haven't got that good chemistry happening and have to constantly adjust my game style to my adc's, at the moment that's what i'm currently trying to adapt to.  I don't mind making the sacrifice for my adc's or whoever, but if i know that it's blatantly their doing that gets them in the shit for no reason, i ignore whatever excuse they use to blame me.  My adc's lately consist of people who don't watch their mini-maps and ignore warning pings lol","replies":[]}]}
