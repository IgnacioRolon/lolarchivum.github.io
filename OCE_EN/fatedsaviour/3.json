But what i think riot really did is made her kit a little accessable, shes always been known as a zoner but what her ult was mostly used for was a very small slow if u were in range, or the E R combo which sent them to the ER. but now, u cant do you tons of dmg combo whenever u feel like it once u reach 6, giving your opponents a chance at dodging but still giving you a good chance to hit them. The one thing people havent taken a look at yet is how the mana cost, you will consume a bit more mana doing E R if u want to attempt it, making it less accessable, and giving it more of a ultimate feel. With the 1.5 secs till charge but when not fully charged not as much dmg, it puts more emphasis on having the enemies be inside the ultimate as long, but with a well places Q its done. Most enemies didnt stay inside the circle without multiple hard cc making it hard to zone quickly in teamfights.\r\non one final note, riot, u did a good\r\ndoesnt make up for the fact that by making kat balanced, you had to make a ton of other assasins not balanced, but your on the way to redemption in my eyes\r\nplz dont ban me","replies":[{"poster":"Requiemsfire","date":"2016-11-23T04:54:57.639+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"On paper update is good, in practice she's absolutely gutted. A lot of midlaners already punished her crappy early game since the only Anivia had to use her Q to set up for an E. After 6 Anivia is now probably the weakest mage in terms of viability and practicality because her ult requires 1.5 seconds to set up with a 6 second cooldown. She has the slowest movement speed in the game with a very low base HP value with no mobility in her kit whatsoever and no sort of sustain tool. She's now a late game mage who is all too easy to shut down because opponents will stop respecting you all together.

She already has been nerfed but now thats too much. Really, why bother playing her when you can play Syndra, press R and delete someone. Riot, you sucks. You prob already know taht, but i want to be sure so i repeat: you suck, hard.","replies":[]}]}]}
