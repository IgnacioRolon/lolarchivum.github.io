Firstly i was a bid tense due to it being 3rd game of my series to climb to b2, no one say your only a bronze skrub ok, first thing i wanna say, im bronze cuz of people like this draven. We get into game, im support. i choose sion. he spammed play a proper sup. I told him how last time i played a &#039;proper sup&#039; i fed. He said, feed then. He chose mundo saying that sion sup is legit, mundo adc is legit (didnt lock in) malph said i would play a proper support (he said not after draven locked in) the instant i locked in sion support he said fine then, ap draven, and changed his summoners to clense and teleport. Throughout the game he tried to legitify full ap draven saying &#039;it would work well with sion support&#039; and &#039;clense for ashe arrow&#039; and &#039;tp so i dont miss out on farm&#039; He also played as if he didnt give 2 craps, didnt bother to dodge abilities and sometimes just went ham autoing in a 2v1. Please someone at riot, give me a chance at my series back, or assure me this arsehole has been reported {{champion:119}} {{item:3006}} {{item:3100}} {{item:3101}} ","replies":[{"poster":"trolledallmylife","date":"2017-03-11T15:30:05.490+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"Nothing will happen, even if the stupid automated punishment system picks it up, the guy will just take 10 sec to create a new account and troll again! \n\nStop playing this game, tell everyone not to play it!\n\nThen maybe, just maybe Riot will listen when they start losing money and player base!","replies":[{"poster":"Dovino League YT","date":"2017-03-11T23:38:23.390+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"TROLLEDALLMYLIFE LOOK AT YOUR NAME. This is on the boards which means riot could see this. He is just trying to make the game better. Even if they have to make another account they might of spent money on that account before they were permabanned therefore having to spend more money and they will probably be a little tilted about that. They have to spend even more money about it and have to play a decent amount of games to buy the champs that they like playing while they troll e.g. Teemo. They have to spent time playing the game to get that 1350 ip, and did you think about this new players lvls 1-15 dont know much about the game anyway so what is the point they aren't going to get their fun out of it if their team is like e.g. \" What?\" \"Huh?\" and stuff like that. They have to spend time getting to lvl 30 so they can play RANKED because that is where in my opinion( not that I do troll though I tend to sometimes) ranked is where people get tilted faster and teams become more salty meaning there is a better sensation to it if you successfully troll. Trolls adapt to being cursed and offended because they are used to having that thrown at them as a response and that's what gives them the happiness they get a TOXIC RESPONSE. By getting the toxic response the other teammates start to get toxic at the troller because they know that teams at are toxic lose 30% more games which makes the troller feel even better. Anyway Riot are trying their best .{{champion:32}}","replies":[{"poster":"FatedSaviour","date":"2017-03-12T01:26:51.019+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"do you guys beleive i was in the right?","replies":[{"poster":"Peroxis","date":"2017-03-12T03:30:10.354+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yeah sion supp is good.
