For example, Achieving &#039;A&#039; to &#039;S+&#039; will add 1-4 league pts to our ranked game regardless of win or loss. I believe this system can restore some justice to players who did well in a game but loss because of bad team mates, DC, AFk etc. In the situation when players who are on &#039;0&#039; points, this system will gave them one more chance to stay in that tier which they deservedly so if they have done so well in that last game.","replies":[]}
