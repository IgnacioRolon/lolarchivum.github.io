This shows you everyone who is currently Challenger and if there is a little eye next to their name that means you can right click it and spectate the game they are currently in. It's not as convenient as it could be but it still gets the job done.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Omni Presents","date":"2016-06-23T05:15:49.632+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Spectator mode was quite rubbish. Most games I spectated were not worth watching, they were mostly one sided and showed exactly what I keep saying, this game is not balanced, not with the champs or the matchmaking or now even the dynamic queue and I think Riot wanted to stop players from watching and seeing how bad the game was.","replies":[]}]}
