Even if the matchmaking is still skewed in enemies favour (in terms of rank), you and your team of friends will eventually have the synergy to beat this and continue to improve. \n\nInstead of blaming the system, take a long hard look at yourself and note down some things that you think you can improve. What you did good, what you did bad. Actively work on these things. Your games are pretty evenly matched right now, with almost all players you are with and vs being bronze 4 or 5.","replies":[{"poster":"Salavas Eldermar","date":"2017-04-07T07:07:57.593+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"you should have to rely on fucking friends to play ranked. ranked is more important than normals so the matchmaking should be better instead of putting others who are decent at the game with fucking idiots. you shouldnt have to be silver to be decent in bronze.","replies":[{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2017-04-07T12:28:30.297+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"If you are climbing, then it would imply that you are better than your rank. If you are staying where you are, it would imply that you belong in that rank. So there is an argument that yes, if you wish to climb out of Bronze you should probably be aiming to achieve SIlver skill, since Silver is the goal, and therefore the level of skill you wish to reach.\n\nOf course, if you are content to stay in Bronze and simply play at the skill of your rank, then no, you don't have to be Silver skill level, you'd only need to be Bronze x skill level and understand that since the gap between the tiers is much smaller that it will fluctuate with win streaks and lose streaks, but will ultimately even itself out.","replies":[]}]}]}]}
