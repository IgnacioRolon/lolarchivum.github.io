Are them suppose to replace ranked teams so people can team up to play ranked? Why do we need 50 plus members? It is like being invited through SMS to those party that no one knows anyone!","replies":[{"poster":"Im a CAT","date":"2016-04-04T06:40:49.649+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"> What do you want with clubs\n* Meeting like-minded players ( Chill, casual, aram, rank etc)\n* Creating theme parties in different game-modes ( speed comps, ulti comps) \n* Banter about things ( Riot, sandwich ( if that is the name of your club)) \n* Mainly getting a cool tag \n* Showcase that you have fam \n\nBut in all seriousness clubs can be whatever the owner of the club wants it to be. I am part of a club where the owner is proactive in creating competitions in custom games with some incentives for the winners. And I'm part of my uni club where no one really talks but just want to flaunt where we study. \n\nWell if your club is form just to be easier to create a rank team then yeah why not. And 50+ members is not enough :/ Especially if you joined a club that is affiliated with a university.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Devils Advocate","date":"2016-04-24T07:42:10.215+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Kjhin hit the nail on the head with all the points, my club is predominately for the 25+ crowd in OCE servers that are sick of toxic immature team mates and wish for an environment with like minded people. \n\nThat being said, ours is based round the fact we have responsibilities, careers, partners, young kids, pets etc, homes to maintain. Mine is more an area where we understand that and if life happens to interupt our fam. We don't e-kick them in the balls and flame. We understand, notch it up as a loss and move forward. \n\nBut mostly its for people who want a place to hang, without the childish trolling. To express ideas and thoughts without the fear of \"OMG THATS SO DUMB, ARE YOU NOOB? DO YOU NOT KNOW XYZ STRATS?\" It's a place to make mistakes, learn, grow, have a laugh, meet new people, perhaps create your own ranked team within. \n\nBut mostly its for people who understand we're playing a game, we enjoy a win, we also enjoy a loss, we don't get our ego's off the game. We play to relax and have fun, as we grow we'll have people from bronze-diamond etc. Some will want to focus on their ranked more and move on later, maybe to return some day once their personal goals are achieved. We wish them well on their journey and welcome them back when its done.\n\nI have actually liked the idea of some of the others creating inclub comps etc with minor incentives, be it $10 to each player in the team that wins in RP or something. Just something to have fun with. Maybe i'll allow the club message to be the winning teams choice- a link to some victory song etc, something that makes them feel good and though mostly casual, will improve peoples skills without the stress of ranked play. \n\nWho knows, i've run major guilds before in other games. I've run large sucessful guilds in WoW with over 150+ active raiding members and moved onto PvP where i've created a 2.2k+ club for rated BG's and arena when alot of us quit raiding end of WotlK. Delegation is key, at present. It's feeling out for us, the direction where the bulk of people wish to go. I will act as a final decision maker, but i'll bend to the wishes of the clubs majority if its in good taste. \n\nWith us being mature and older, i don't see too many issues with internal whinging. I expect my members to be able to sort out their own issues without attacking personal character etc. Opinions are like buttholes, everyone has one. Everyone thinks theirs doesnt stink. That being said, if you have an opinion and want to share it, you must accept others also without jumping down throats. \n\nThats 25&UP in a nutshell at present.","replies":[]}]}
