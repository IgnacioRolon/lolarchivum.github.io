It only earns less if you cs as support because then you're taking gold from allies that are nearby who can get full gold (cs while nobody's near for AGES, I think it turns off after full gold which is greatly fair), I like getting them after laning or during still though if enemies fed us enough (e.g gold from turrets and harassing between fights, and csing to push). Not too sure about the new rune, feels random and that extra income item, I haven't checked whether it turns into a different enough item or specifically just for a role","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"xEternalFeederx","date":"2019-11-22T06:12:52.575+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"'unplayable' \nor, different? its stronger than before for many. c'mon grow up a lil and take some time before posting in the boards","replies":[]},{"poster":"DarkShade918","date":"2019-11-21T23:00:56.091+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I've found with the new support, the strong champs are the Mage/Enchanter/Playmaker Supports\n\nPicking Karma, Morganna, Nami, Soraka, etc. tends to void this, plus picking playmaker supports like Pyke and Thresh allows you to utilise the alcove\n\nAlternatively, pick cheese supports, like Pantheon, J4, Lee, etc. they tend to be quite useful as the support meta right now is open to interpretation, just don't Int and you should be alright, if your ADC complains, just mute them and play well (or to the best of your ability)","replies":[]},{"poster":"Grouchy Poro","date":"2019-11-21T18:13:50.261+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"haven't even explained your issue/problem","replies":[]},{"poster":"Pikachoochoo","date":"2019-11-21T19:42:46.310+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"no it isn't unless you mean the meta but if you go against the meta with op combos you might start getting qued with mass trolls, noobs, and fake accounts. https://boards.oce.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/player-behaviour/wPkMrL9H-what-the-fuck-is-up-with-rank-losing-1-game-then-lose-fucking-10-games-and-put-with-people-who-afk?comment=0001 More trolls https://boards.oce.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/help-support-oce/NBhEWAwE-i-just-met-a-weirdly-disturbing-shen?comment=00010000000100000000 https://boards.oce.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/miscellaneous/tQ98FEZG-its-not-really-skill-if-you-keep-custom-teaming-in-a-reliable-team-and-get-s-rank-or-purposely-keep?comment=0002 Or not getting support utility spells because there aren't enough people literally worth or trustable anymorehttps://boards.oce.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/help-support-oce/kB5tm0y9-i-downloaded-a-match-due-to-a-toxic-person-for-the-5th-match-today-in-ranked-but-its-not-even?comment=00000000 (ghost has a 2s channel or telleport for telly ganks, nexus backdoor or extra cs, etc).
