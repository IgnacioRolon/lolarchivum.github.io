My guess is when they cut the blue pots and his Q range being reduced too short that makes him under par to every other champs to date! He was once a great unique champ but now he is useless.

If you fall behind it's bad but my god does it piss off toplaners. You're tanky, you heal out the ass and with a triforce and titanic hydra you do decent damage.

Your e does decent damage, your bush strats are terrifying, you still do amazing damage in teamfights if you have a proper tank on your team and you melt towers so fast with your atk speed buff and  you are the king of getawats with his movement speed and slows.\n{{item:1402}} {{item:3100}} {{item:3157}} {{item:3089}} ({{item:3135}} or {{item:3512}}) {{item:3020}} \nthis last one sounds stupid but I kid you not this nunu build melted towers faster than any udyr I've ever seen. The enemy team goes for a 4v5 teamfight and wins yeah but whilst they were fighting nunu just melted 3 towers, tanked a bit using enemy minions and was finishing off their nexus before they could realise what was happening.","replies":[{"poster":"Nightjar","date":"2016-08-27T13:11:34.883+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"it was a beautiful game because it was so stupid.
