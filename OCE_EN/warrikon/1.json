But it never came! I used to spam dominion games back when it was in its prime, maining talon bot and winning about 90% of my games. I would go on to do so for a year or so. I wanted more of a challenge, I wanted my scores to be recorded like they were in ranked. Dominion ranked was the first thing to actually interest me quite a bit in league, and that was why I started playing ranked 5v5&#039;s. Because...\r\n\r\n_It never came.\r\n_\r\nRanked never arrived, or was even tested. I mean it was a pretty fun mode. But without ranked the community lost competitive interest. It became a silly pass time but playing ARAM or Hide&amp;Seek or Catch the Teemo or something like that was far better.\r\n\r\nI even remember getting into ranked 3v3&#039;s, that shit was amazing. I did it with my two friends who played league and were at my level because we didn&#039;t have enough for a team. It was hard with the lack of players for the 3v3 game, but it was still very fun and interesting. Again though, coming to OCE, the lack of any 3v3&#039;s ranked system made me lose interest. You can polish that shit up as much as you like but my only interest is to play competitively. I like the challenge. I know many others do as well.\r\n\r\nI hope you learn for the future riot and I hope this creates discussion on the next moves for riot, because I haven&#039;t seen any posts of it (Dominion&#039;s ranked) and I can&#039;t post on NA anymore cause obviously my acc is moved...\r\n\r\nAnywhoo. Goodluck kids :)\r\n\r\n-Warri, posting for the first time since the boards died.","replies":[{"poster":"HTMekkatorque","date":"2016-02-17T19:54:30.106+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I have waited in queue for 10 minutes today for ranked 5's even.
