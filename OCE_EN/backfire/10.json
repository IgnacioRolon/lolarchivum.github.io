Now the new Veigar isn't as good, his stun is still a threat when used in a teamfight that limits where the enemy can go, IE the jungle. His new Q is better for farming than his old equivalent and more mana preservative, helping his lackluster early game.\n\nI have mained Akali since I first played her back in the day, I personally wrote a few of the early guides for her on various sites, I personally will always defend her to be the *perfect assassin*. Of course that doesn't mean she isn't strong, because by %%%% she is strong, however her con is the most obvious and easiest to counter in League. True vision; I do not agree with any nerfs she has received as she was never played competitively (or hardly chosen as I don't follow those crappy tournaments) I don't care what Riot said, the DFG removal hit Akali hard as it was core for her, it allowed her to remove tanks or that idiotic Vayne who rushed a goddamn Warmogs (and Vayne being Vayne, even with a HP item and Guardian Angel still out-damaged everyone in the game) with ease. When Riot decided to not allowed her E to be activated by her Q on top of DFG being removed crippled her poke, we all know Akali's pre-6 was very bad unless the enemy messed up badly. Walking in to auto the Q meant taking more damage than she could dish out at early levels. But Riots rampart goal of squishing assassins into the ground was backed up by the next nerfs she received.\n\nAkali's skillfloor is low, her skillcap is high, much like Katarina. Any bronzie can play them and do well, much like 99% of the champion roster, but mastering them isn't an easy task, Akali was a single target assassin who relied on her stealth to survive. Going in too early would get her killed, going in to late meant their CC and wards may have already been placed and up again. Katarina is the same, a  good Katarina waits until the optimal time, circling the fight trying to get assists for her passive and hope to push that first assist or kill to the advantage. Lee Sin is the same, I detest Lee Sin as a skill-less sack of %%%% who brings way to much to the match, but he is the same, he is hard to master.\n\nAs for LeBlanc? Her mobility comes at the cost of her skill floor being somewhat high and her skill cap being the highest in League, LeBlanc is a mobile mage who has a lot of damage, and no resistances, if she blows both her escapes to deal damage and is caught, she will die. However, a good LeBlanc can kill 2 enemies on 300 health with juking alone, it can be amazing.\n\nLearn the game before you start spewing bull%%%%.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Lauricella3","date":"2015-03-16T05:34:42.197+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"To be fair lee's q is a skillshot, annies stun has half the range and barely 2/3 the duration and leblanc has to jump to melee range to w.","replies":[]}]}
