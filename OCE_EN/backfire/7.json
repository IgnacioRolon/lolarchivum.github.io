I mean, yeah the range reduction on her ult is definitely a nerf, but making her E no longer proc Q is a buff. It allows you to ultimately deal more damage. See, if you Q someone and then ult into them, you are guaranteed an auto-attack on them, hence proccing the Q, dealing the damage of both your initial Q, ultimate, auto-attack and Q proc. If you instead were to use E to proc Q instead of an auto-attack, then you would deal the damage of your initial Q, ultimate, E and Q proc. Now, with E no longer proccing Q, you can still get the auto-attack in, meaning you deal damage with initial Q, ultimate, E, auto-attack, and Q proc. You're getting an auto-attack's worth of damage into it. This could be exploited if you were to get Lich Bane or something like that.","replies":[{"poster":"Niji","date":"2015-01-30T00:06:27.589+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=HORSE OF FORCE,realm=OCE,application-id=Ntey9fRZ,discussion-id=2UbmoKZb,comment-id=0003,timestamp=2015-01-29T23:14:50.585+0000)\n>\n> I don't see how its a nerf though.

A lot of times you may need to use E because AAing is not an option say someone with a melee range ability (volibear flip etc) is chasing you down E allowed you to Q-E and stay out of range of that ability whilst still running away overall the nerf is just annoying and not changing much about her overall power.","replies":[{"poster":"HORSE OF FORCE","date":"2015-01-30T02:58:25.624+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You can get the cooldown of Q to be under a second?\n\nMy stance on it is that this change, ultimately, increases her damage *BUT* it increases the amount of time she has to spend in doing so, hence meaning if the enemy escapes early, they'll avoid a lot of damage.\n\nOverall, I like it.\n\nRIP assassins.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"DiamondAries","date":"2015-01-30T01:47:41.313+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I had a feeling Akali would get nerfed.
