I could still type the letter 'R' in chat though so there wasn't anything wrong with my keyboard, and then I double checked my keyboard bindings and it was fine. \r\n\r\nI tested this out again in 'training' mode and her ultimate won't work for me - Then I tested out Ahri in training mode and her ultimate/R works fine?? Anybody else having this issue? \r\n\r\nLost my game coz of this - feels bad.","replies":[{"poster":"Evulpix","date":"2020-02-06T08:29:42.458+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"J/K apparently this is because they recently changed Akali's ultimate to be a targetted ability and I had no clue zzzz","replies":[]}]}
