Also I&#039;ve read  the discussion on surrender@20 and the PBE boards so I would like to share my thoughts on one aspect I didn&#039;t like.\r\n\r\nDarius E Apprehend\r\n\"Fixed a bug where enemies would be pulled in if they escaped the area during the cast time\"\r\n\r\nThis statement  is about when champions use an escape but still get pulled (I think) which I reckon should remain because that is one reasons I like Darius as it&#039;s fun to pull off and master plus they have removed the movement speed bonus from his passive so I think this \"bug\" is necessary due to Darius being even more immobile than before so he should have some stickiness to compensate for this weakness. While the have changed the passive to deal physical damage and the interaction with black cleaver I still do not think it is enough and I personally would prefer this over the slow on E (PBE) or even nerfs to other parts of his kit.\r\n\r\nThey where also talking about champion identity and how every champion should feel different from each other and when I think of Darius, this is part of his identity and how he operates especially the \"Juggernaut\" theme as Darius will be slow but will have some form of CC to keep people in the fight. \r\n\r\nEverything else seems okay or even good to me, what are your thoughts on his rework?","replies":[{"poster":"BarryButcher","date":"2015-08-06T23:24:17.130+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The new Darius changes already make it so he can literally 3 hit anyone and build full-tank.
