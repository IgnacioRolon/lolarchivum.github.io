This is not the time to be thinking about that, I still have to finish climbing this cliff face. I was careful while climbing, I always remembered to keep 3 points of contact. I usually would be at the top by now but i&#039;m not used to climbing something so icy and cold. Everytime i planted my grip i had to make sure that the point was safe, You never know when a foot or hand might slip. The cliffs in Freljord are a lot more challenging than the ones im used to. It all happened so fast. I was falling, How stupid of me. I forgot 3 points of contact. I went from being so confident i would scale this cliff to falling faster than i can say the word &quot;SHIT&quot;. All of a sudden i had stopped falling. I thought i had hit the bottom and was about to die but no, Something had caught my arm. It was pulling me up over the top of the cliff. I landed on my face at the top. I slowly pulled my head out of the snow to look at my saviour.  He was tall and was ripped. Like Tyler1, But bigger. His muscles looked big enough to hold a chamber door.... NO, IT CANT BE??!?!?!....B...B..Braum? &quot;hello little one, What are you doing so high in the mountains?&quot; i didn&#039;t respond, i was to shocked that i had been saved by the one and only Braum!!! &quot;you look cold, come with me&quot;. He led me to a cabin that was not big but not small, It was really cosy. &quot;Braum, is this where you live?&quot; He responded with a quick nod. &quot;I have made you some coco, you need to warm up&quot; I accepted the offer and was soon presented with the most beautiful looking cup of coco i had ever seen. I quickly drank it and stood up feeling as strong if not stronger than braum, I had spilled some on my shirt from the rush. I looked at him. He smiled...Not a nice smile, an evil smile &quot;w..w...what is it Brau..&quot; i felt my legs give in, I fell to the floor, The wood was hard. But not as hard as Braum. he explained the situation to me. He had drugged the coco with dragon tranquiliser. He bent down and whispered in my ear &quot;the heart is the strongest muscle &gt;:)&quot; Everthing went black. I woke up at the bottom of the cliff. I got up and looked around &quot;ahh, Just a dream. I could really go for some coco right now&quot;. I didn&#039;t see the coco stain on my shirt..... The night was cold against my balls, They jiggled in my boxer briefs.","replies":[{"poster":"Ahri Ahri Ahri","date":"2016-06-25T02:05:36.895+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"7 words in and I've already lost interest {{item:3070}}","replies":[{"poster":"MemoryStickGuy","date":"2016-06-28T12:40:38.336+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"lol......lmao....","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"MemoryStickGuy","date":"2016-06-28T12:41:55.726+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"{{sticker:zombie-brand-facepalm}} \n\nthis is my very honest reaction","replies":[]},{"poster":"ChodeyGoatey","date":"2016-06-25T05:03:56.321+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"{{champion:120}} {{champion:61}} {{champion:48}}     {{champion:1}} {{champion:27}}     {{champion:114}} {{champion:6}} {{champion:42}} {{champion:429}}","replies":[]}]}
