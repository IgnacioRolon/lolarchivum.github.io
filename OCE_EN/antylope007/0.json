One bot is enough to secure a loss for the entire team, the team I versed in the linked match had only 1 player and 4 bots. My team only had 1 confirmed bot so of course we destroyed the poor guy.\r\nCan people **PLEASE** make sure you report bots for boosting and cheating. This issue is not yet being taken seriously by the admins so we are going to have to get every bot banned manually. Also, be careful to report confirmed bots and not crappy players. Reporting the wrong players will get your reports muted.\r\n\r\n\r\n_**Dear admins**_\r\n\r\n_**Would you please do the community a favor and put in a function where people can vote to remove a player from the game**_. Make it so that if the &#039;bot&#039; does not vote against it then they get instantly kicked and a 1 week temp ban. As I previously mentioned, 1 bot wrecks the game. I would rather play with 1 less teammate than have a teammate go 0/18/2.\r\n\r\n**Thank you\r\n    `` ant``**","replies":[{"poster":"antylope007","date":"2015-11-22T14:43:28.026+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I played 4 games with a level 30 player on ARAM and there was no bots. He then left and I played 2 games with a player who wasn't level 30. One of those games only had 3 human players, one being on the enemy team and my friend and I on the other. The other game had 4 human players, two on each team.\nMaybe I should just get to level 30 so it is no longer an issue.\nI have found a repetition in bot names and I can tell which players are bots. Just look at my match history and find players that die 5 times as much as their kills. Occasionally one has a single number as the 3rd last character. Most of them have two words, both starting with capital letters but both spelled incorrectly. The rest are just random letters with a few capitals. All have rather long names that don't make sense.","replies":[{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2015-11-23T03:28:24.376+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Your best bet is probably just to try playing normals until you get to lvl 30. If you're level 24 it shouldn't take too long and then you won't have to worry about them anymore. It's a problem for sure but it's one you don't have control over. So report it and find a work around. You've already done the first bit so I wish you good luck getting to 30 and hopefully not having to play with bots anymore :)","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Biofuel Jungle","date":"2015-11-17T06:58:43.173+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"What the hell are these voting options?

For the first few days of an update that targets bots there will be a massive decline in the amount of bots because they wont be able to vote no. They don't even vote in the surrender votes.\nOn the other hand, you cant kick an active player because they will just click no. You could get rid of AFK players but there is no point to that as at least they aren't feeding.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Talon12","date":"2015-11-17T06:30:24.244+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"i hate that guy who uses a sona bot, so god damn annoying, had them twice in a row. The ai attaches her as a supp to the champ nearest to her on spawn and she follows them all game, once it was a jgler attached, other it was a mid it attached to.
