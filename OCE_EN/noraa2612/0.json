However to gain said BE you can no longer gain it by winning a game, you only gain from disenchanting loot from loot boxes you get every level up that now have _&quot;More stuff than usual&quot;_ in them but you only start to properly gain BE once you level up from level 30 onward, but by this time it takes at least **10 WINS** to level up, and this only increases with further levelling therefore making it increasingly harder to gain BE and making the game a pay to play game... The average game of LoL takes about 30 minutes, however i have had some over an hour, and this undoubtedly is deterring players and forcing people to pay for in-game currency, riot points (RP). What **WAS** fun about league was the excitement of purchasing a new champion and learning to play a varied amount of champions in different lanes well. This has been completely **ERADICATED ** in my opinion. Sorry, rant over, please just let me know how you guys all feel about this, i may have over exaggerated at some points just let  me know. \nI do completely understand that this is not riots fault and in fact it is that of _**Tencent**_ which is Chinese company that own 100% of riots market shares and therefore controls the economy. so This is** NOT**a choice made by Riot but one forced upon them by Tencent to increase their profits... \n\nThanks guys!\n                  Noraa","replies":[{"poster":"ll F A M E ll","date":"2017-11-11T05:34:35.175+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"With the new system each game feels meaningless since all you get is exp... It's so unsatisfying knowing that it takes 15+ games to level up to only get one champion capsule that has a chance of giving champions that you already own.\n\nPeople are stating that it supports those who are accumulating too much IP since they already own everything and summoners just starting out the game who owns nothing, but the majority of the community, which is pretty much the middle ground, is feeling heavily conflicted since they're relatively old players that don't own everything.\n\nIn short... it sucks shit.","replies":[{"poster":"JasonWazza","date":"2017-11-11T06:41:56.231+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":">and summoners just starting out the game who owns nothing\n\nIt doesn't support them at all.","replies":[]}]}]}
