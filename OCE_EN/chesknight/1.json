I&#039;m assuming this is just an oversight, but it&#039;s jarring enough that I thought I should mention it. I sent in a support ticket, and they recommended I post it on the Bug report board. Seeing as for whatever reason I can&#039;t post on those boards, I thought I&#039;d post it here.\r\n\r\nIt&#039;s a really minor thing, but like I said, I thought I should at least mention it.","replies":[{"poster":"Deep Terror Nami","date":"2015-12-30T11:27:01.651+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yup, Rito is aware.
