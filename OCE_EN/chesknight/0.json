Being in Bronze VI means that I can&#039;t really play him that much (or that well...), but in Normals good god do I love to play him.\r\n\r\nHowever, upon loading a game, I noticed that sometimes different music plays than the typical summoners rift theme. Instead of the normal music, music resembling Ivern&#039;s Login Theme plays instead. It only happens occasionally, only at the very start (0:00-1:40ish), and it only happens when I play Ivern.\r\n\r\nMy question is twofold: is this an actual thing, or am I hallucinating? And if it is an actual thing, where can I find it so I can listen to it more than once every 15-65 minutes?\r\n\r\nI really love Ivern&#039;s theme, being my favourite Login theme in the game next to Taliyah&#039;s. The little easter egg of Ivern-style music at the beginning of games is almost sure to bring a smile to my face (that&#039;s sure to get wiped off soon enough).\r\n\r\nTL;DR: When playing Ivern sometimes different music plays at the very beginning instead of the summoner&#039;s rift theme. Is this an actual thing or am I having a stroke.\r\n\r\nIn case you couldn&#039;t tell I&#039;m bad at queries. Thanks!!","replies":[]}
