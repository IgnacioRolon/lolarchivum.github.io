They almost always have a summoner name that is something along the lines of [randomword][randomword][randomtwodigitnumber] like this &quot;TeaScooper55&quot;. They will also always choose {{summoner:6}} {{summoner:7}}  and have this bear summoner icon. Can anyone else respond that may be experiencing this issue or if there is a way to disable these bots? The trundle bot is an absolute idiot and well, it makes ARAM no fun at all, and that is the casual game mode for me :(","replies":[{"poster":"herbertmcgoldenb","date":"2015-10-02T03:23:21.495+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I just posted something similar and would love to see someone from riot take the time to address this issue.","replies":[]},{"poster":"ZykIon","date":"2015-09-30T05:53:42.253+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Where have you been?! For like.. The past year or so, there are ALWAYS bots in ARAM.
