Make her choose between a slow Xerath charging strategy and a velkoz prediction strategy.\n\nHer Q is charge up similar to Xerath's Q, but in travel time (and possibly healing, idk) rather than range. She'd support by either zoning off people through paranoia of instant, hard to dodge damage with a charging Q in exchange for a slower movement speed, and giving them time to run, or by an instant cast but slow projectile speed predicted Q that works like normal Soraka's Q. It would continue to strengthen her identity as the queen of heals and zones","replies":[]},{"poster":"Realm","date":"2015-10-21T03:54:40.619+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You mean exactly like soraka already is? She already has the increased time it takes the further away q is cast, but it isn't global. At the moment, soraka is op. she has to make herself vulnerable somehow, and have some form of counterplay, with a global q, this removes this.\n\nImagine a scenario where someone is really low under tower on the enemy team, recalling, and soraka notices this and just throws a q from wherever she is, it kills that person... soraka isn't intended to get kills, she is intended to heal, healing from across map is unnecessary.","replies":[{"poster":"TeCoolMage","date":"2015-10-27T13:23:58.191+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Recall in sight and not notice the beautiful glowing artwork under you as you spend 5 seconds recalling due to lag\n\nBut no seriously don't ever add global damaging abilities in basic abilities...
