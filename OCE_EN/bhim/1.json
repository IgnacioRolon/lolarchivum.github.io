Now it has been some time, and there are larger websites emerging. Not only would it be a benefit for us, the Summoners who can now get free skins, but it will also be a benefit for you, Riot, by getting more recognition from these websites.\r\nWebsites I suggest you put a new skin to\r\nReddit ( Subscribe to the Subreddit )\r\nSteam ( Join the Steam Group )\r\nInstagram ( Follow on Instagram )\r\nI understand for Steam and/or instagram ( not too sure if there is a LoL instagram account ) there may not be an account but then obviously make one haha.\r\nThank you.","replies":[]}
