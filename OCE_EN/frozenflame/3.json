If it was limited to Udyr, Tryndamere, and maybe a few others which have little to no ability to engage, then sure fair enough -- it makes sense. Except it&#039;s not limited to them. Every ADC, mage, tank and assassin has it. Heck pretty much every character I see these days has snow ball and flash -- and of course they do, it&#039;s OP as hell.\n\nAt the very least it needs a nerf. Similar cooldown to flash, no damage, etc...","replies":[{"poster":"Rocka","date":"2015-12-20T07:13:57.856+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"it makes the game fun.

There're just SO MANY that become OP with it. Like a Fizz with snow ball is practically unstoppable. No matter how good you position yourself, you're going to die. Not to mention Amumu.\n\nAnd it shouldn't be spammable like it is.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"FrozenFlame","date":"2015-12-20T22:04:51.607+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Also when you hit snow ball you should automatically dash rather than being able to activate the dash whenever you want. That way if you shoot it you're committed to going in.","replies":[]}]}
