When there's five players on a team in a small lane, as well as minions, it's hard NOT to hit something -- increasingly so the more snow balls a team has. Not to mention the low cooldown and the large hit box.\n\nMany tanks have their own gap closers as well, so even after jumping in with mark they can catch anyone trying to escape with their own abilities. This essentially makes it impossible to guard one's rear team members. For example an Amumu with Mark, Flash and his own Q would be essentially impossible to stop.\n\nThe thing that skews the game is poke. It's because you can have five champions on one team with no poke, and five on the other with insane poke. And the snow ball doesn't fix that.

Which you've clearly ignored. And your point is inaccurate because it's too broad. You said a lot of champions don't do well in melee range, but if a tank has already initiated and your team is going in, or the enemy is retreating, being close is often ideal. It depends on the circumstances.\n\nThe snow ball gives tanks and bruisers insane opportunities for initiation, and allows the rest of the team to quickly chase down retreating enemies.\n\nIt's easy to dodge one snow ball when everyone is poking. But dodging up to five, as well as keeping away from minions it can land on, to stop a tank from initiating is impossible. And dodging them in the middle of a team fight? Not happening. Especially considering they can come from off screen.\n\n> Mechanics mean nothing if you don't know how to use them.\n\nMechanics need to be balanced. If everyone needs to use a certain summoner spell to win, it may as well not be there. It would essentially force players to change because of the addition of said spell.\n\n> I would like to direct you back to this though:\n\nAnd mark does nothing to correct it. ARAM is supposed to be random. That's its nature. You get what you get, and have to do the best you can with your character's skills. Adding a summoner to try and make it easier for melee champs to get close is just a bad move.\n\nSometimes you'll just get a team that absolutely nothing can be done with. Luck of the draw. But that rarely happens. You can always work with your team, and try and outsmart the enemy team if they have a better team composition than you.","replies":[{"poster":"Project Xayah","date":"2015-05-02T02:35:51.868+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"> ARAM is supposed to be random.
