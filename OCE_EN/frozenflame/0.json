Closer to 7 probably. I played normals for about a year and then switched to ARAM -- back then we&#039;d 5v5 Summoner&#039;s Rift with ARAM rules. \n\nToday, I exclusively play ARAMs as I find them more fun, and much quicker. And I really like what Riot did with Howling Abyss.\n\nHowever, when Mark was introduced I objected -- as did others. And then a couple of patches later Riot nerfed it, reducing the range and damage, which made it less painful... but it still doesn&#039;t belong in anything but special events.\n\n**Back then** -- at it&#039;s introduction -- I read a post by someone from Riot who said, more or less, that Mark was introduced to try to balance ARAM and make engaging easier for some champions that really struggle with it.\n\nAnd I don&#039;t disagree that there&#039;re some champions, such as {{champion:23}} , {{champion:77}} , etc., that really have terrible engage and benefit from Mark.\n\nBut {{champion:1}}  doesn&#039;t struggle with engage. So why does {{champion:1}} have Mark?\n\n**And therein lies the problem and my point** -- it&#039;s being abused. There may be five, ten or even fifteen champions that struggle a lot with engaging, but there&#039;s another 110+ that don&#039;t. And of that 110+, there&#039;s at least 15 or 20, that gain a ridiculous advantage from it.\n\n{{champion:1}}  jumping in with Mark and stun ulting a team. {{champion:238}} hitting a target with Mark, ulting and then dashing back across the map. {{champion:245}} doing the same thing (and getting his health back while he&#039;s at it.)\n\nAnd don&#039;t forget all these... \n\n{{champion:9}} , {{champion:105}} , {{champion:30}} , {{champion:222}} , {{champion:62}} , {{champion:127}} , {{champion:32}} , {{champion:12}} , {{champion:24}} , {{champion:59}} , {{champion:120}} , {{champion:64}} , {{champion:78}}\n\nJust to name a few...\n\n**I can&#039;t count how many times I&#039;ve seen it on an ADC**. On a mage. On a character with already GREAT engage. And I see players with it every game -- at least five, often six... seven...\n\nAll Mark has done for ARAM, is made it chaotic.\n\nI really hope Riot removes it. But if they don&#039;t. I hope they restrict it to specific champions like Tryndamere, etc.\n\nNow that it&#039;s been a few months, are any other ARAM players like myself feeling the same?","replies":[{"poster":"Essembie","date":"2015-09-01T13:55:29.861+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Its aram.

The champions aren't balanced around aram so there will always be some stuff that's op, removing mark just makes different stuff op instead. Benifit outways the negatives imo.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Tele","date":"2015-09-01T11:52:18.180+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You said it yourself man \"I find them (ARAM games) more fun\". Riot didn't make ARAM to be a perfectly balanced mode, they made it to be a fun mode. And before if you got Udyr or Nasus was super boring, now Riot has allowed them to make plays with Mark/Dash. \n\nMark/Dash isn't going anywhere soon.","replies":[{"poster":"Omni Presents","date":"2015-09-01T14:28:36.404+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I actually remember when they made ARAM, and that is sad.\n\nRiot gave all employees some time to do whatever the hell they wanted for like a week or something.

There's four other players on the team, and minions, all of which can be hit. Plus, a flash can be used after snow balling if they're not already in perfect position.\n\nThere're also situations where you're forced into a position where you can't dodge. You've got flash, but then it's down for five minutes and they'll have another 8 or so opportunities to snow ball you while it's on cooldown.\n\nOn top of that, you've got to dodge the rest of the snow balls on their team as well. A coordinated team can easily aim at the same target and hit it because you've got no where to move.","replies":[]}]}]}
