Usually restarting my whole computer works but that's time consuming. Other times i usually have to keep re-opening my launcher until it works which is usually 5-6 times. When I'm in game though, there are times where i freeze still which lasts forever pretty much and when i leave and try to reconnect, it usually comes up with the error which then leads to me spending about 10 minutes trying to get in again. I've tried refreshing DNS and repairing and none of them seem to work. If anyone could help would be great.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Wuks","date":"2015-12-11T13:11:11.939+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey FrozenFlame, \n\nWhen this happens, you might want to try to restart your client, as sometimes the client throws that error repeatedly until you restart your client. Otherwise, your phone might be blocking certain ports. It's really hard to tell. If it happens again, try running a Tracert to the League of Legends servers (guide linked below). \n\nhttps://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752674-Network-System-and-League-of-Legends-Logs\n\nCheers!","replies":[]},{"poster":"FrozenFlame","date":"2015-12-20T06:34:25.612+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I see.
