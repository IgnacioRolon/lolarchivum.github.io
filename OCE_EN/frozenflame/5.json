And who knows? Maybe it&#039;ll work out really well.\n\nThis is what I&#039;ve been thinking about:\n\nIn this **new mode**, five random champion categories would be selected and assigned to the five player slots. This means **both teams** would have the exact same team composition. And each player gets a random champion out of the category corresponding to their slot.\n\nFor example you&#039;ll play one match and might get:\n\nPlayer 1 (ADC)\nPlayer 2 (tank)\nPlayer 3 (ADC)\nPlayer 4 (mage)\nPlayer 5 (support)\n\nAnd another match you might get:\n\nPlayer 1 (mage)\nPlayer 2 (assassin)\nPlayer 3 (support)\nPlayer 4 (bruiser)\nPlayer 5 (mage)\n\nAnd limits could be placed if needed so that you don&#039;t get more than two or three of any one category (or only specific categories such as tank.)\n\nIn this way you won&#039;t end up a team of supports against a mix of ADCs and mages.\n\nWhat does everyone else think of this?","replies":[{"poster":"Settero","date":"2015-05-12T00:12:38.470+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"why not just play a sr if you want to have a balanced game....","replies":[{"poster":"FrozenFlame","date":"2015-05-12T00:26:15.797+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Well In short... ARAM is faster paced. You level up quicker, you're in 5v5 team fights from the very start of the game until the end, and it's usually over in 15-25 minutes.","replies":[]}]}]}
