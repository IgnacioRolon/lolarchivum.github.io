As an ADC, boots aside, what would you get on your first trip to base? Let say early game, you have 1500 gold, is BF Sword the best item to get considering it makes last hitting and trading easier. However items that include BF Sword tend to be more expensive. Vam Scepter gives you sustain but it delays you from getting BF sword or other items. Unless I intend to farm/trade til well into mid game I feel like VS doesn&#039;t give me significant advantage in teamfights. \r\n\r\nPersonally I&#039;m not a fan of rushing the BOTRK as my first item. Yes it gives AS and it&#039;s passive is good against tanks (early tanks dont have THAT much HP anyway), but I find that BFS is heaps better for trading and zoning. Sometimes I get BFS then rush Statikk shiv, then either BOTRK or Blood Thirster.\r\n\r\nWhat&#039;s your take peeps? Thanks in advance.\r\n\r\nBabyPanda","replies":[{"poster":"Horizonn","date":"2016-04-22T14:19:58.149+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"As a jinx main, basing with 1500 gold instantly buy a bf sword and 2 pots and a pink ward. After that picking but a Runaans as your first full item is insane on jinx and the AoE from the rockets apply to the bolts fired from the runaan passive which increases her wave clear and damage quite nicely and if done right can destroy in lane if they are caught in their minion wave. Also Try buying a Cull as an early base item if you cant afford much else","replies":[{"poster":"littlebabypanda","date":"2016-04-23T05:06:00.392+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey thanks for the reply buddy!\n\nRunnaan has the same problem though, it doesnt give you any AD. It's the about same as phantom dancer (+100gold). With runnaans it's really hard to freeze lane due to the bolts. With Jinx's increased base AS as you level there's no need for bolts really, but I guess they are good for teamfights. I think the question really is which is better, AD or AS+crit chance.\n\nCheers for comment.","replies":[{"poster":"Horizonn","date":"2016-04-24T01:42:07.029+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Runaans grants you bonus 15 damage on hit so it kinda gives more damage but its now a main buy item on jinx. Phantom Dancer isnt really good on jinx because she isnt a duelling ADC which is where Phantom Dancer shines. When you have around 4000~ gold you shouldnt be worrying about freezing lane because it give the enemy time to roam helping there team, its better for you to rotate to each lane and shove it in so the other team has to respond or you get towers. When you shove a lane watch you map closely and check if any threats have left vision.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"GigaPube","date":"2016-04-23T17:57:31.686+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"depends on the champ. infinity edge isnt worth it normally, as a 1st item, but if you really want to chance it with a good crit  you can rush it if you want. but if you dont get 1 in any of 5-10 autos on your enemy you paid 3600 for a BF sword with 25 more AD. 2300 gold worth of \"stats\" down the drain cos of RNG. runaans is pretty strong right now in general, i wonder if its any good with the rageblade combo","replies":[]}]}
