He has no escapes so why are all his abilities have such short range, yet he is a ranged champion. He has such an awkward role. His mana build doesnt let him scale like the other mages. I feel like Riot has done a half-a** job when they reworked Ryze. \r\n\r\nLook at all the immobile mages...\r\nLux has snare, slow, AND a shield, yet all her abilities deal apparent damage. Ryze&#039;s E doesnt do S*** even til mid/late game.\r\nBrand has a long Q and stun\r\nVelcoz is just godly\r\n\r\nThoughts anyone?

Not simply mage, but champion. He can cycle a mixture of Magic Resitance Reduction, Crowd Control, and High Burst damage. Which in conjunction with his ultimate, means a lot of AOE damage and Heals. A Ryze sitting on 4 stacks will be able to shred any immobile non-tank from 100-0 with good spell cycling. \n\nAlthough he has a cooldown on this passive and requires the ability to be able to stack it up. This causes him to have huge spikes and troughs in power. If you all in Ryze when he is early levels without any passive stacks up there's not much of a way for him to be able to duel you after he has rotated through his spells once, as they will not be able to reset at all. Keep an eye on this stack count and as it is effectively his version of a Gnar/Renekton Rage Bar. \n\nIf you are trying to learn to play Ryze better, be aware of your stacks and the order needed to cycle your spells as efficiently as possible. Ryze needs to combo the right spells in order to get the most out of his passive. Typically you will see people open up with W- Rune Prison, and then cycle in as many Q's in between each spell as they can. \n\nHe is getting an update in the mage patch cycle, but at the moment I think he is in a fine spot, if not even looking too strong. Each champion has a lot of in-depth combinations and synergies that make them playable at a certain level, you just need to do some research and figure out exactly how they work best!","replies":[]},{"poster":"Ingénue","date":"2016-04-29T11:06:14.908+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"[Ryze is having another gameplay and visual update soon™  ](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/202294884-Champion-Update-Schedule#h2)\n\nCurrently, Ryze is a semi-tank mage building items such as frozen heart and rod of ages. This tankiness would usually be pretty devastating for a full on burst mage with super poke like Lux, because you would never ever be able to kill them. That's why all his abilities have a short range, he is tanky enough to take it. \n\nHe is a great duelist champion, played to face someone to the death rather than poke and runaway (like most other mages). This is why he is a pretty immobile mage. He does get a small burst of movement speed from his ult, which has a pretty low CD and can be used defensively to escape from a gank (much better to use offensively though). \n\nIn line with his duelist identity, he gets stronger when spamming his spells face to face (it is also where his passive shines). \n\nTL;DR he is designed for dueling and if you look at it that way, his kit makes sense.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Sulbatamol","date":"2016-04-29T01:47:16.055+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Well faker will laugh his ass out for little noob like you complain about godly infight mage","replies":[{"poster":"Talon12","date":"2016-04-29T10:36:33.170+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"but faker was a no good dirty feeder in the last professional series all the negative scores...

You'll notice that in Lol, the more survivable (health wise) you are, the less escapes and the shorter range you get.\n\nAll champs are a mix of 3 traits:\nDamage \nTankiness\nUtility \n\nDamage speaks for itself, if your spells/abilities take away lots of HP then you have damage.\n\nTankiness comes in either: HP, Armour, MR, Lifesteal, Spellvamp, Shields and heals. If you have lots of one or more of those things, then youre tanky. \n\nUtility is anything that doesn't help you do more damage, and doesn't help you take less damage. These are things like CC, dashes, vision, clones, range, Walls, speed boosts, etc etc. If you have lots of them then you're a utility champ.\n\nNow obviously if you have all 3 extremes and had massive damage, were impossible to kill and dashed around the map stunning things all the time, you would be really Broken. So champs do not have 100% of all 3 traits.\n\nVayne has Massive damage and massive utility, but her trade off is that the only way she can stay alive is by not being hit by anything. She's a Damage/utility champ \n\nVladimir has lots of damage and lots of tankiness, but he cant really do much else to you. He's a damage/tankiness champ\n\nLeona does no damage, but is really hard to kill and has loads of CC and a dash. She is a Tankiness/Utility champ \n\nAnd some champs like Poppy, have an even spread of all 3, she does damage (but not as much as Zed) she is hard to kill (but not has hard as Volibear) and has a lot of interesting things in her kit (but not as much as Azir) \n\nSo you have to think about what ryze is and where his strengths are, and what his trade offs might be.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Requiemsfire","date":"2016-04-28T16:08:55.699+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'll start by saying i'm honestly not very skilled myself with Ryze but I just wanna say this\n\nFirstly, His Q though it can be used for poking, it's not meant to poke,  His entire kit revolves short range spamming spells until an enemy dies. Treat him like you would an AD carry. Ryze's ultimate grants him innate spell vamp, lots of AOE damage from each spell and a lot of movement speed meaning that if he's opponent cannot burst him down then that guy is dead. On top of all that Ryze's kit possesses innate cooldown reduction and his passive grants him a shield.\n\nCombine these factors together, you have a late game sustaining short range burst mage, who has a shield, deals AOE damage, and lots of movement speed. That sounds pretty strong actually especially in team fights.\n\nThat being said he does have a fairly high skill ceiling and requires help from his team to peel from champions like {{champion:238}}. If Ryze get's focused he will die well before he can start his combo.  I would also argue he has a higher skill floor than most champions simply because he is more difficult to use than most mages. \n\nLet's discuss the weaknesses of the immobile mages you speak of. Brand relies on landing his entire combo a good portion of the time and both of their abilities aren't too difficult to dodge. Furthermore they can't really sustain themselves in a fight, if they deliver their combo they have to wait till it's off cooldown to act again. One more thing to note is that Ryze does have mobility in his kit thanks to his rather short cooldown on his ultimate. \n\n\nBrand and Vel'koz serve better in siege compositions as opposed to Ryze who would serve better as a backline damage dealer.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Z3npachi","date":"2016-04-28T14:37:20.854+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Wait are you trying to say Ryze is bad?
