I couldn&#039;t just let Divine Sword Irelia fly just yet as an  {{champion:39}}  fan. \r\nHer upcoming splashart has: \r\n1. her neck and \r\n2. the last digit of each finger \r\njust that bit too long. \r\n{{sticker:sg-soraka}} \r\n\r\nBeing an only-{{champion:39}} -4-eva-bae &lt;3 kind of guy (***cough*** _1.35K games_ ***cough***) I just wanted to tell someone because I would love to see it adjusted to scale before it goes live. Now I know these are super minor changes, and I&#039;m probably just being melodramatic or something, in fact, most people probably wouldn&#039;t feel the need to be talking about this, because other than this, the entire skin is out of this world! Like, top notch; ridgey-didge; the real deal; absolutely and utterly exceeding expectations! I can&#039;t stress how much I _**already**_ love the skin. I really can&#039;t!\r\n{{sticker:sg-jinx}} \r\nP.S. If this message is passed on, and the person reading this is about to pass this message onto the artists working on this skin splashart, please look them firmly in the eyes, shake their hand, wait a moment, and then give them a solid &quot;Thank you so much, you have pleased an Irelia main in Australia so much that he wanted to write a ticket just to thank you for the work you&#039;ve done on the splashart. Rest well tonight, in the fullness of knowing that you are an incredible human being&quot; &lt;&lt;&lt; _I&#039;m actually legit, do this plz! I love you &lt;3_","replies":[{"poster":"Cyberno","date":"2018-08-24T10:17:23.212+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Ok thank god its not just me.
