So yeah. Get them for about 20 bucks for the software required to make one on your own.\n\nOr how about not waste a week of your life and listen to this guys idea? He isn't talking about stream overlays, he is talking about huds that you can buy with RP that would change your IN GAME hud. Changing the announcer voice is one thing, but changing the hud requires experience in coding, file formats and photoshop. Not exactly what the everyday player can accomplish.","replies":[{"poster":"YellowBrickRoad","date":"2016-04-19T10:02:34.025+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"leaguecraft.com/uimods/\n\nYou really didnt even attempt to think about googling it did you.\n\nIt was literally the first link too.","replies":[{"poster":"DipperOCE","date":"2016-04-21T14:53:54.428+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I would like you to look at the available uis.
