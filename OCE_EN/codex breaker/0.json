I've attempted to raise multiple tickets, however, none have seen any results/contact to me. My main account (Rubiqcube IGN) has for some reason either been hacked/locked. Last week on Thursday, I attempted to login to the website in order to find out how much money I had spent on the game. However, the website prompted me to get a link (in order to confirm my identity) from an email address which I have unfortunately do not have access to. At this point, I was still able to use the client just fine so I continued playing. However, the next morning the client would not let me log in citing that my password/username was incorrect. I did not change my password - so either what's happened is the people who have my email address have changed my password, or riot have locked my account. Either way, I have not been able to log into my account since Friday. Could someone please PM me - email me, or just give me an update? It's driving me batty. I have many friends on the rubiqcube account who can verify my story, furthermore, I have access to the number that I signed up for Clash. \r\n\r\nThanks in advance,\r\n\r\nRubiqcube/Jamie/Codex Breaker.","replies":[{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2019-07-16T14:22:26.592+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"There is a high volume of tickets at the moment so support is a bit slower than usual. You didn't really give any idea of a timeframe, but submitting more tickets for the same issue before receiving a response just bumps you back to the bottom of the queue.\n\nIf this was the case and you've been sending multiple tickets in close succession, then just stop that and wait a couple of days and you should get a response. If you at some point got a response to the effect of \"you have been transferred to the player behaviour team\", they are a much smaller team (but more specialised and able to handle certain cases) so just be patient.\n\nMost likely you will be directed through the account recovery process to verify ownership, secure and then restore the account.","replies":[]}]}
