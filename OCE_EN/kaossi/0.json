I&#039;m a support main with a large champion pool. Currently a S2 but was previously gold in past seasons. I feel that I play at a higher level than S2 (but don&#039;t we all). I&#039;m looking for a team or clash team for this weekend.  My mains are Alistar, Janna, Thresh, Leona, Rakan, Morg, Braum and Lulu. If you need a support, at least let me try out before you deny me because of my rank. I would be willing to play a couple normals so you all can see what I can do as a support.  IGN is Kaossi\r\n\r\nThanks all, looking forward to playing on a team!","replies":[{"poster":"Jumanjiji","date":"2018-05-25T00:53:03.979+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hi, I am an ADC main and have a Mid main friend looking for team.
