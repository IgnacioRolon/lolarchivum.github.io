If you only focus on grinding you are going to get frustrated when it doesn't happen as fast as you want it to. \n\nAs for honor resets, i'm not sure.","replies":[]},{"poster":"pieceofpecanpie","date":"2017-08-30T01:01:25.436+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I had a 2 week suspension myself which, although surprising at first, did make me focus on my behaviour and approach to games. \n\nNevertheless, despite the behaviour change, it took over a month of solid playing to hit level 1.

And it'll be a pleasant surprise when it happens.","replies":[]}]}
