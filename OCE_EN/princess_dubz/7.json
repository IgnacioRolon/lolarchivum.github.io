However when building a AD heavy build involving ghostblade steraks and other AD heavy items you struggle to kill people. I think the reason people build into bruiser for shaco is because he&#039;s now a better tank than assassin, and not to mention all of the shaco mains in korea non-stop complain about the state of him. So is there any chance that we could possibly have the old shaco return? because right now he&#039;s broken and not in the overpowered way :(","replies":[{"poster":"Roguestoney","date":"2017-05-15T22:58:03.502+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Not likely.","replies":[]}]}
