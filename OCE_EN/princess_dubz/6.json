Atleast you have Riot on Twitter saying that their opinion on champs is better than the population of the game playing those champs everyday. Talking down to players like youre game isnt made by the shits you take in the toilet daily. How hard is it to fix a client man, these bugs werent a thing on the old one just bring it back ffs.","replies":[{"poster":"J0NESY","date":"2020-01-11T12:51:02.223+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"while i don't condone your \"humour\" I do agree with the underlying message within.\n\nI regularly see issues with my client, most regular of them would be it lagging or constantly crashing. \n\nIt would be even funnier if they included a repair tool to fix these problems that didn't really work!

Let's see if we can get this fixed for ya.\n\nThe main issues are client lag. I'm not 100% sure what triggers it but sometimes my client will be so slow I will have to wait around 4 seconds for my commands to respond its not in game at all just on the client. \nIt seems to start after someone dodges a queue or I leave the after game wrap up screen. Once it starts the only way to stop it is to close the client and reopen it.","replies":[{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2020-01-14T01:52:17.592+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hmm that's an odd one. Depending on where your PC falls on the low/high-end spectrum some of these suggestions may be more impactful than others but let's give it a go. In Order: \n\n1.

Is there a Cache file for the client i can delete or anything like that?\n\nRunning a clean install will be my Very last option as restarting the client makes it work again. I do think im not the only one with the problem as i have had others saying they cant change runepages when their client is bugged","replies":[{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2020-01-18T12:32:02.034+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"As fare as caches and old files, a clean reinstall is by fair the easiest option to make sure you clean out everything.
