And now i feel like if i even type the word f*ck i will get perma banned. Do you guys think that players should be feeling like this? I understand what i did was wrong and why i got banned, it was a deserved ban especially considering my history. But now since the ban i feel like the system of which people get punished isnt very effective as my friend has inted so many games and told so many people to kys and has never once gotten a restriction or a suspension. \r\nWhat do you guys think to both questions?\r\nShould players feel like there is a ban hammer looming over them that if they say anything they will get banned\r\nAnd do you think the system is skewed to punish those with extreme views\r\n\r\n(Also to clarify, i was only being racist as a joke with my friends just trying to say the most extreme stuff i can, i dont actually think that whites are better than blacks etc)","replies":[{"poster":"JukeMaster420","date":"2017-08-13T08:49:49.166+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Well I think that's kind of the point since if you feel like anything toxic will get you permmed it's gonna prevent you from doing so?\n {{sticker:slayer-jinx-wink}}","replies":[{"poster":"Princess Dubz","date":"2017-08-13T09:16:17.783+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"You clearly didnt read what i said or didnt understand it but its ok ill clarify what i said here:\n\nIf i just say the word fuck in game i will get banned.\nSaying the word fuck isnt toxic","replies":[{"poster":"Project Xayah","date":"2017-08-13T10:33:08.625+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Swearing in and of itself generally wouldn't lead to punishments, the context which they are used in can change that, though. There wouldn't be much point to a profanity filter if profanity was explicitly punishable, after all. Perhaps you're using swears in a way that the system picks up as \"inappropriate use\" (or that is commonly considered \"inappropriate\"), resulting in action being taken. I don't suppose you could provide some examples of the kind of things you'd say in-game (or even the relevant chat logs).","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"vPRINCE DIABLOv","date":"2017-08-18T02:41:19.914+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"THIS CLOWN WORKS FOR RIOT DONT GO BY WHAT HE SAYS","replies":[{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2017-08-18T09:25:40.715+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"He does not.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Doc Savage","date":"2017-08-13T09:20:30.464+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=JukeMaster420,realm=OCE,application-id=T8eq2lFQ,discussion-id=NXKe1ifz,comment-id=0000,timestamp=2017-08-13T08:49:49.166+0000)\n>\n> Well I think that&#x27;s kind of the point since if you feel like anything toxic will get you permmed it&#x27;s gonna prevent you from doing so?\n>  {{sticker:slayer-jinx-wink}}\n\na perm or x amount of time mute would also prevent them doing so?","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Fitzky","date":"2017-08-13T08:56:32.040+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"http://imgur.com/IW1hwIw","replies":[{"poster":"Plutooh","date":"2017-08-14T10:03:35.984+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Fitzky,realm=OCE,application-id=T8eq2lFQ,discussion-id=NXKe1ifz,comment-id=0001,timestamp=2017-08-13T08:56:32.040+0000)\n>\n> http://imgur.com/IW1hwIw\n\nSums it up in one.

The reporting system is FUKD riot you need to fix it because so many people are getting FUKD over by it. You say you check them but how do we know we just have to go by your word... No i want to see proof. SHOW US PROOF THAT WE ARE GETTING JUSTICE AND REPORTING SYSTEM WORKS...
