My plan is to get fit so my brain can be 100 hundred percent active for high speed reaction and decision making that the team based sport requires. To stream my progress/training 8 hours a day on my days off from work so i can gain some publcity in order to be noticed by OPL teams and to establish a basis to attempt full time streaming (professional entertainment basically). And to top it off By the end of 2017 be in the top 10 of challenger players (highest ranking on oceanic server). \r\n\r\nThis is all to achieve my dream of being a professional League of Legends player: traveling for competition, experiencing new groups of people,&nbsp; and competing in the world championships with thousands upon thousands of people&nbsp; watching and cheering my team on or booing. Either all, it definitely would be the experience of a life time. So why not come watch my origin story as it forms? \r\n\r\nIll be fighting for this goal till the end, no giving in! \r\nHey guys any help is invaluable&nbsp; to me so please SHARE this post and help me get kick started \r\n\r\nmy stream/climb Facebook page&nbsp; https://m.facebook.com/MangekyouEterno/\r\n\r\nOr watch me on my days off.\r\nwww.Twitch.tv/Mangekyou_eterno\r\n\r\nFirst stream will be on the 18th or 19 depending on how busy i am.
