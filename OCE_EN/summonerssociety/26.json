Summoners&#039; Society has a lot of opportunities to help improve and develop your skills as a caster. Our aim as a community is to help you reach your goals, however we can!\r\n\r\n*Casting fact!* Rusty started off in Summoners&#039; Society. We have that OPL blood in us! \r\n\r\nCasters meet every Monday from 8:30pm to approximately 9pm. This is just a general meeting we use to catch up and talk about projects. Once a fortnight, you&#039;ll be provided with feedback for a vod. Once a month, the team will also do a &#039;vod swap&#039; and give constructive criticism to each other. There are plenty of casting hours per month (approximately 100 hours) to help grow and develop your portfolio. We also have some sneaky BIG side projects in the works. \r\n\r\nThough you will be a Summoners&#039; Society Caster, you are not contracted specifically to us and are free to help or seek any other opportunities you see fit. The only requirement we seek of you is a professional can-do attitude with a willingness to learn and develop. \r\n\r\nIt&#039;s a great time to be apart of the Summoners&#039; Society family, so don&#039;t miss out. Apply today.\r\n\r\n\r\nhttps://goo.gl/forms/KPDg5Ui34Y2gOqpl1","replies":[]}
