If both teams are out of game and only you are in lobby, please contact the team in discord. (We use discord for this purpose).\r\n\r\nHow to get tournament code\r\nGo to bracket, click on your game and scroll down to the section that says tournament code.  \r\n\r\n\r\nAll contact must be made on the Summoners Society Discord under #helpme. Please donâ€™t pm admins, as not all admins are working that day and information gets lost! You should only pm admin if someone is being toxic towards you. \r\n\r\nRules\r\nhttps://docs.google.com/document/d/1Knefe_DHNoUzZgq1AXPO9Drm8zr7z5sehJ3p5HgB2aA/edit?usp=sharing \r\nPrizing:https://boards.oce.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/community-events/bWtno6fE-tournament-prizing-how-does-it-work\r\n\r\n\r\nFacebook group: https://www.facebook.com/groups/SummonersSocietyOCE/","replies":[]}
