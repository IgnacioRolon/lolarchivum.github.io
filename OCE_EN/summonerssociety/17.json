We run online events every month and customs games in our discord! Every month we run a creative competition for those of us who are actually creative ;) ! But in general we have some pretty cool conversation and have a lot of fun.\r\n\r\nWe are growing pretty fast. The more people that we get the more awesome live and online events we get to run and help grow the community even more!\r\n\r\nSo come check us out if you are interested!\r\n\r\nfacebook group: https://www.facebook.com/groups/SummonersSocietyOCE/\r\n\r\nPeace","replies":[{"poster":"Dungeon Warlord","date":"2017-04-13T18:39:27.125+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":4,"body":"Don't believe them, they are a bunch of self serving idiots. They kicked me from the group because I wanted to promote the game through my 1v1 tournaments. Every other group on facebook I have spoken to have been more than helpful in this regard. \n\nTheir are much better groups than this bunch of clowns.","replies":[{"poster":"SummonersSociety","date":"2017-04-14T06:42:50.832+0000","up_votes":9,"down_votes":1,"body":"Hey Dungeon Warlord,\n\nYou weren't kicked from wanting to promote your tournaments. You where kicked for not following rules and be rude to admins multiple times. As for your tournament not being shared in the group, the admin that approves them was unwell and had the flu for 2 weeks and in that time you where removed from the group because you where posting toxic comments on the page. \n\nWe are sorry you experience with SumSoc was not a pleasant one, you can always message an admin. We can always lift the ban if you can show that you will no longer break rules or be toxic. We keep screen shots of everything, so we happy to show how you broke the rules, explain and clear everything up! \n\nSummoners Society is very focused on keeping the group clean from Toxic behaviour. \n\nHave an awesome day and good luck with your 1 v 1 tournaments! \n\n{{sticker:slayer-pantheon-thumbs}}","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Dungeon Warlord","date":"2017-04-15T02:07:47.775+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"***","replies":[{"poster":"Wuks","date":"2017-04-15T21:43:19.210+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"This appears to be a personal dispute between you and the organisers of this community.

I gave you over a week to process my request from the form you made me fill out(no reply).

I stand by my previous opinion.","replies":[{"poster":"SummonersSociety","date":"2017-04-15T00:17:49.716+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey Dungeon Warlord, \n\nWe understand your frustration but Summoners Society is not at the whim of your personal needs.  The admin was unwell and basically away for two weeks with a very bad flu, in that time instead of being patient you where toxic in the group, which it was lead you to being removed. It had nothing to do with your tournament. It was not the first time you where toxic with in the group or in the discord. \n\nYour response to when things don't go your way is to become toxic, which isn't fair on the admins or the community to be a part of that. \n\nIf you ever do one to come back work things, your always welcome! Sorry we couldn't change you mind, but as you can see on our end there is no ill feelings. \n\nHave an awesome day and good luck with everything! \n\n{{sticker:slayer-pantheon-thumbs}}","replies":[]}]}]}
