We are here to help expand our creative minds personally and with Summoners&#039; Society. The content team members are encouraged create their own content, but content that is design and created for Summoners&rsquo; Society will stay ours and credit will be given to everyone on the project and it can be used for portfolios. Summoners&rsquo; Society will do our best to help team members with their own content in anyway we can and it will still remain the property of the team member and not Summoners&rsquo; Society. This role is a stepping stone for anyone creative who wants the experience to further progress their career, loves league of legends and wants to give back the to community. We are always looking for amazing opportunities for our team and have some coming very soon.\r\n\r\nThis role wouldn&#039;t be suited for person who doesn&rsquo;t like to receive feedback, this role is about improving together and individually.
