We run online events every month and customs games in our discord!  Every month we run a creative competition for those of us who are actually creative ;) ! But in general we have some pretty cool conversation and have a lot of fun.  \r\n\r\n\r\nWe are growing pretty fast. The more people that we get the more awesome live and online events we get to run and help grow the community even more! \r\n\r\nSo come check us out if you are interested! \r\n\r\nPeace \r\n{{sticker:slayer-jinx-catface}}","replies":[]}
