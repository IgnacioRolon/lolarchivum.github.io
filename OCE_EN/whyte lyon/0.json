What had once been heavy slabs of muscle in years gone by had slowly given way to fat, but he was still a big, intimidating man. His gaze was inscrutable, his eyes having long been replaced with soulless, reflective black lenses.\"\n\n>\"Takeda&rsquo;s inherent violence and ambition had seen him rise from humble beginnings to become one of Zaun&rsquo;s most powerful Chem-Barons, the infamous rulers of the undercity.\"\n\n\n\nI&#039;m celebrating the down time before the second half of this so far amazing [Zaun LU](http://na.leagueoflegends.com/en/featured/piltover#zaun). The character above is a non-champ figure, who has intrigued me since his first mentioning as the most infamous Chem-Baron. I had a love hate relationship with this drawing while developing it as even though I do consider myself a decent sketcher, I&#039;m by no means the greatest. I&#039;m very shy when it comes to sharing my designs because of that but it was my friends who ~~peer pressured~~ kindly suggest I do this. \n\nHopefully you think its cool.","replies":[{"poster":"Froskurinn","date":"2017-01-16T22:43:45.166+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Is super cool!
