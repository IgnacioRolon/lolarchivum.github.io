The neon City of Progress, a harsh beacon in the night. Time never seemed to slow down here, and this stormy night was no exception.\n\nThe phantasmal beckon of the spirit realm had been calling for quite some time, but the figure atop the rain drenched high-rise was merely maintaining order while the true guardian of Piltover chased a lead in yet another shattered timeline.\n\nShen knelt slowly on the very edge of the roof. He closed his eyes and raised his head, letting the acidic rain bite into his forehead and cheeks. Despite the advanced military-grade Pulsefire tech he had been gifted by The Remembrances, he felt no relief in the near toxic air of the city. \n\nHis thoughts shattered as the booming sound of an explosion echoed through the luminous streets below. He snapped to attention, rising to his feet, his eyes scanning for the source beneath the haze.\n\nThe call… The corporeal beckoning finger of the spirit realm pulled him forth.\n___ \nAcrid smoke flowed into the street, billowing from a gaping wound in the wall behind The Ecliptic Vaults. Burning shrapnel and multicoloured hexes falling like rain around a figure walking with confidence and a singular purpose. Stepping into the smoke and debris addled street, trench coat swelling behind, with a grin, he tips his hat. A thin, card of crimson energy flashes in his hand as Twisted Fate spins quickly, sending it hurtling back into the exit he made, the card slicing through the smoke-filled air as he dispatched his final pursuer.\n\n“This was much harder back in the day,” Twisted Fate chuckled to himself, eyeing the rippling blue energy that ran over his Pulsefire tech, “It’s almost too easy.” He patted the inside pocket of his coat with satisfaction and deftly snatched a falling hex from the air, the objective wasn’t money, but he couldn’t help himself, his face breaking into an arrogant grin once again as he flipped the small golden coin in his hand, charging forth into the damp, neon streets, ignoring the shrill cry of the sirens.\n\nHe chuckled as he ran, so enraptured by his own thoughts that he barely noticed his partner fall in line.\n\n“Smart and quick, I knew I picked the right guy,” came the boyish tone of the electric-blue figure beside him, “I hope it wasn’t too difficult while I was gone?” Ezreal’s words sounded almost like a laugh as he surged forward, “The freighter through The Sun Gates leaves in an hour.”\n\nTwisted Fate smirked, “What happened to your tail?”\n\nEzreal flashed a knowing smile, “I gave her the slip three time-lines back and there’s no way she’s recharged her core fast enough to jump,” Ezreal laughed, picking up speed and teleporting ahead in a blink of flashing blue energy.\n\nTwisted Fate’s eyes narrowed as he placed a hand against the item he had stolen for Ezreal, stashed under his coat – It was a Jump-core, designed to allow Remembrances to travel through time-lines and maintain order. This was going to change the game and Twisted Fate could not hold back his devilish grin.\n___\nThe rain made it difficult to see as they ran and shifted through the streets of Piltover, the overflowing drains filling the crammed passageways with fog. Twisted Fate’s searching eyes were the only thing that alerted him to the fact they were no longer alone.\n\nThey skidded to a halt as a dark figure burst from a cross-alley, through the fog. A blade of crackling blue energy slicing easily through Ezreal’s armour. The assailant spun, landing a kick directly into the chest of Twisted Fate, sending him reeling back as a second strike landed, slashing deep into Ezreal’s arm as he tried to turn, caught off guard. In a flash, a golden card of energy materialized into Twisted Fate’s hand and he steadied himself, preparing to throw it, but he reacted too slow as his attacker turned, brandishing the sword with expert speed and slammed it into his chest, driving it to the hilt.\n\nHe felt all the air rush out of him as he glared into the azure gaze of The Eye of Twilight. He grimaced, fighting the urge to pass out as he pushed his foe away, gasping as the blade withdrew.\n\n“Surrender, you have already lost,” Shen sounded so matter of fact, so confident and it irritated Twisted Fate.\n\n“Forget it. It’s two against one!” he spat, “You dealt yourself a losing hand!”\n\nShen evenly met his gaze, “You’re mistaken…”\n\nTwisted Fate’s eyes widened in shock as a spiraling portal of surging pulse energy formed in the middle of the street, spanning its breadth. A lone figure stepped forth from the swirling mass; an icy gaze, locked, unblinking on the recovering time-thief. Caitlyn, the Sheriff of Piltover, hefted her rifle, aiming beyond Twisted Fate and Shen and without a moment’s hesitation, fired.\n\nEzreal shifted too late, the shot punching clean through his shoulder, the arcane ripples that propelled him forward having saved him from a clean headshot.\n\n“You said she couldn’t jump?!” Twisted Fate exclaimed, stumbling aside.\n\n“I… miscalculated?” the shock on Ezreal’s face was apparent.\n\n“Good work Shen,” Caitlyn started, eyes locked on Ezreal’s new position, “Take care of Tobias. Ezreal is mine.”\n\nEzreal laughed, as Twisted Fate took the opportunity to dive into the nearest alley, running as fast as his feet could take him. He couldn’t hear Shen, but he knew he was being pursued. Every shadow, every flicker of movement in his periphery warning him of his foe.\n\nThe first blow came as a full-speed shoulder charge. Twisted Fate was nearly knocked off his feet as his vision blurred, the only thing he could focus on was the spinning form of Shen as the all-too-familiar spirit blade came crashing down, this time, instead of blue, a vibrant orange. The blade bit through him like he was made of paper, but the pain brought him clarity. He clutched the card he still held in his hand and with a deft flick, shot the spinning card at Shen.\n\nTwisted Fate grinned as it detonated, cascading the dark alley with golden light. He turned and ran back the way he came, flicking three blue cards between his fingers and with one sweep, sent them hurtling back up the alley, towards his weakened enemy and with a mocking wink, disappeared into the fog.\n___ \nThe street was a cacophony of gunfire, empty shell casings and streaking arcs of energy sizzling through the air. Neither backing down as Ezreal, laughing the whole time, and Caitlyn, laser focused, hunted for the final blow.\n\nTwisted Fate watched the duel carefully with a birds-eye view, picking his moment as an ocean of blue cards swirled around him, until he finally found her blind spot.\n\nEzreal chuckled as he heard the flutter, like the shuffling of a deck and a single shard of yellow energy flickered in the fog behind Caitlyn as he noted his partners return.\n\n_She didn’t even see it coming._\n\nEzreal forced the last of his power into his arm-cannon, the surge of energy lifting him off the ground as he steadied it with his other hand and smiled.\n\nThe yellow card struck Caitlyn square in the back, bringing her to her knees as the street exploded with golden light.\n\nShe felt helpless, her body paralyzed, as the blazing wave of arcane energy closed in on her.\n\nRight before the barrage struck, however, a burst of Pulsefire energy cascaded over her and the stalwart form of Shen materialized before her, stark against the burst of encroaching light.\n\nShe didn’t even have time to cry out before it ripped right through them and slammed them down onto the soaked ground. \n\nShen closed his eyes, a rare smile tugging at his lips as his breath left him, the beckon of the spirit realm calling for the last time.\n\nEzreal chuckled to himself, his partner had disappeared, but he’d finished both Shen and Caitlyn off right as his reserve power depleted, although he wasn’t surprised, he’d always been lucky.\n\nA loud click echoed through the street, and Ezreal’s heart skipped a beat as he recognized the high-pitched whine of Caitlyn’s target-locking system engaging. \n\n“Got you,” She breathed.\n\nTwisted Fate heard the gunshot from where he lay, the acidic rain biting into his skin as he placed a crimson hand over the wound on his chest. His breath came in rasps as he glared past the luminescent, smog filled sky. He tried to roll onto his side, to crawl, to do anything to escape, but he flinched as he felt something dig into his ribs, under his tattered coat.\n\nHe pulled the small, humming Jump-core from its hiding place and held it up, shakily in one hand as a grin spread across his face.\n\n“Alright… Let’s try that again.”\n\n\nhttp://skinkk.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Pulsefire-Twisted-Fate.jpg","replies":[{"poster":"Zœ X Lulu Hentai","date":"2018-09-28T02:16:52.193+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Very nice!","replies":[{"poster":"Krispy Migraine","date":"2018-10-01T05:51:59.970+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thank you sxtyrarannosaurus, very cool!","replies":[]}]}]}
