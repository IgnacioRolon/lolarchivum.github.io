Liking helps me out too so I can see if you people enjoy this type of editing.\r\nSubscribe if you think my content is somewhat enjoyable, I (try to) upload atleast once a week. {{champion:68}}","replies":[{"poster":"Maraudaur","date":"2017-05-02T07:02:35.902+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hi man,\n\ncool vid! I think my main point of feedback would be to get your highlights from a couple of different games. That way instead of just showing every kill in one game, you can pick and choose a couple of truly interesting plays. \n\nI think the music and editing were good =D not sure I liked the little screen shake but that might just be me.","replies":[]},{"poster":"littlemisscheeky","date":"2017-05-02T06:59:33.980+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hi MrKillerKow,\n\nI can provide some feedback, but please note that it'll address the \"bigger picture\" than just this video, as I feel that will actually be more valuable in moving your content forward.\n\nFirstly what are your long goals for your youtube channel? What are you trying to achieve each time you post a video? Why should someone watch your videos over someone else? What is it about your videos that makes you unique from others? \n\nI ask all these questions because by knowing these things, you can focus your efforts and tweak your channel appropriately. Right now when I watched your YouTube video, I didn't see why I should watch it over any other piece of content. What was I suppose to get out of that video? Was it entertainment, was it humour, was it educational? And if it was \"X\", how would you rate it under that lens? What would you have done differently? Would you have changed the music? Would you have edited it differently? etc.\n\nI know what I'm getting when I watch a video from PewDiePie or Brofesco or KayPea or DiscoHeat.\n\nOnce you identify what you're trying to achieve, which audience you're trying to appeal to, you can find ways to cater your videos and channel to these viewers. Then the next step is making it easier for these viewers to find your content and make it highly shareable. GLHF!\n\nEdit: I just noticed the video title, \"Silver Montage - Rumble\". Your video content matches that title. In saying that, if your goal is to create a big following on your YouTube channel, is that the type of content that appeals to the masses? If your goal is be a kick ass editor, then the content doesn't matter so much itself.","replies":[]}]}
