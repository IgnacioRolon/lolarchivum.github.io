Whenever i don&#039;t have my flash up, after using it\r\nfor a kill or something other, it makes it hard for me to escape ganks. She has no mobility abilities and like, the lowest movement speed in the game, making it impossible for her to escape from ganks if the enemy has a leap, jump, hop ability, allowing them to just get over her wall easily. Please consider a minor rework :D","replies":[{"poster":"Omni Presents","date":"2015-12-25T06:54:19.607+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I've said it a million times, all the old champions need to be reworked to fit better with the current champion pool with all that mobility that they have. Anivia was made during a time when champions were all the same, but over the last few years it started changing and now her, along with a lot of older champions can get caught too easy.","replies":[]}]}
