Have you ever wanted to compete against fellow rivals on the rift and claim the title of best league of legends team in our close-knit, irrelevant community? Well, now you have a chance! \n\nI (saffyflaffy) will be hosting a league tournament, the final decider, as to which team deserves the title of best league of legends players within our community. So how will it work? Those who wish to participate in this competition must recruit a team of 5 players, who will compete against other teams. The reward? A free mystery gift skin for each member of the team that is last standing.  \n\nOf course, there are rules that must be followed. Below are these rules, and by entering and participating in this competition, you hereby accept these rules and agree to abide by them. If any of these rules are breached, it will result in an elimination of the individual, and potentially the entire competing team responsible for the breach. \n  \nTEAM RULES: \n\t&bull;\tEach team must consist of five (5) players. These players cannot be interchangeable and must remain the same people throughout the competition. \n\t&bull;\tEach team must elect a captain, which will be responsible for communicating with us, on behalf of their team. The captain cannot be changed for the duration of the competition unless the competitor is eliminated, in which a new captain will be elected via a team vote. \n\t&bull;\tTeam captains must announce their teams, with a name allocated to the team, and submit each team members &lsquo;in-game&rsquo; names as part of their announcement.  \n\t&bull;\tEach team captain must submit to me (saffyflaffy), via private discord messaging, a completed Application Form for their team. Application Forms will be in the announcement channel on the discord provided.\n        &bull;     Prior to being accepted as a team within the competition, I will calculate the average team MMR, based on the screenshots provided from the Application Form and average MMR&rsquo;s based on ranks. MMR&rsquo;s from each team member will be added together and divided by 5, which will result in an average MMR for the team. Each team&rsquo;s average MMR must be NO HIGHER than 1650. This is to ensure teams are even within the competition.\n\nINDIVIDUAL RULES: \n\t&bull;\tIndividuals are only allowed to participate in one (1) team. \n\t&bull;\tEveryone must abide by Riot&rsquo;s policies and rules, as set out in their terms and conditions. \n\t&bull;\tEach player must only elect one account, which must be their highest-ranking account, in which they will play their competitive games on. This account must be used for the entirety of the competition. \n\t&bull;\tIndividuals must ensure they select team members which they are willing to play alongside, in a sportsmanlike manner. I am not responsible, nor can exceptions be made if an unsportsmanlike behavior is committed by a team member, without the team&rsquo;s consent. \n\t&bull;\tThe dates which competitive games occur are final unless unforeseen circumstances occur. It is the responsibility of each team member to ensure they are available when the games are held. No exceptions and/or substitutions are allowed. \n\nCOMMUNICATION RULES: \n\t&bull;\tAll competitors must communicate via the &lsquo;hehe xd&rsquo; discord server, which will be linked, whilst participating in the competitive games. This is to ensure there are no loopholes or cheats and the channels can be supervised.\n\t&bull;\tEnrolled teams will be provided with a personalised private channel within the &lsquo;hehe xd&rsquo; server, which will only be available to the five (5) team members and us. \n\t&bull;\tA &#039;spectator&rsquo;s lounge&rsquo; will be created for those who wish to watch the competitive games. \n\nSUMMONERS RIFT RULES: \n\t&bull;\tTeams will be randomly matched against other competing teams.\n\t&bull;\tEach competitive match-up will be &lsquo;best of three.&rsquo; This means the randomly matched teams will play three games and the majority winner will qualify for the next round. \n\t&bull;\tThe number of rounds is dependent on the number of teams registered within the competition. \n\t&bull;\tEach competitive game will be &lsquo;draft pick.&rsquo; Players will have the opportunity to ban the champions they choose, whilst ensuring there are no mirror match ups.\n\t&bull;\tThe captain of each team will be responsible for the banning of champions and must ban on behalf of his/her team, with respect to their wishes. \n\t&bull;\tEach game will be created by me (saffyflaffy) and will have a password, in which only the competing team members will receive. \n\nWINNER&rsquo;S REWARDS: \n\t&bull;\tThe individuals who are part of the last standing team will be mystery gifted a skin within 24 hours of the final competitive game. \n\t&bull;\tThe mystery skin received is final. \n\nMISCELLANEOUS RULES: \n\t&bull;\tTeam registration ends on the 21 December 2017. \n\t&bull;\tThe specific dates and times which the games will be held are yet to be decided but will occur on a weekend evening e.g. Friday, Saturday or Sunday night.\n\t&bull;\tIf any individual encounters problems, experiences or witnesses a breach of these rules, or wishes to provide suggestions about the competition, they must contact me (saffyflaffy) directly, via discord private messaging. \n\t&bull;\tThese rules are subject to change at any time. \n\n\n\n\n\n\nFeel free to share the competiton, the more participating teams, the better :)","replies":[]}
