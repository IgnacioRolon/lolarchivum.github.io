I would be extremely grateful if you added him in and tweaked a few things. All feedback is greatly appreciated and please participate in the poll. I would like to thank Steel Tempest for helping me out with the champion quotes.\n\nChampion Name: Nyle\nPronunciation: Nigh-el\n\nTitle: Valorans Defender\n\nAbout Nyle: Nyle is an old teenager (17/18) and is able to control the earth. Nyle lives at the top of a gigantic mountain, where you can see the most of Valoran. He keeps things in place and makes sure nothing goes too wrong. He defends Valoran from things no one can ever imagine existed but no one appreciates him or even knows about him. He took an oath of keeping his homeland safe and though wars may occur, he was not allowed to take any sides and had to help both teams in ways of him not being able to be seen by them.\n\nLORE:\nDELETED SINCE IT DOESNT MAKE SENSE AFTER AURELION SOLS RELEASE\n\nAuto animation - a spike of rock emerges from his hand\n\nHealth: 520(+60 per level)\nHealth Regen: 5.7 (+0.60 per level)\nMana: 363 (+43 per level)\nMana Regen: 6.5 (+0.83 per level)\nAbility Power: 55 (+3.8 per level)\nAttack Speed: 0.703 (+2.3% per level)\nArmor: 20 (+3.75 per level)\nMagic Resist: 30 (+4.33 per level)\nMovement Speed: 345\nAA Range: 540 (Ranged)\n\nAppearance: Blonde hair (curved to the right side of his head), blue eyes, rock gloves, leather clothing, a cape dragging on the ground as he walks (give me some ideas)\n\nWhat role he is and what he has to offer: Nyle is a tank and a mage and mostly played mid and top. He has quite a bit of CC and is highly effective in team fights by taking down the enemy carry.\n\nSkin idea: 975 RP Blood King Nyle - (Demonic looking) white hair, red eyes, red crown, red cape, red metal gloves, red leather clothing\nChanges the look of his abilities (Red rock)\n\nAbilities:\nPassive - Defenders Spirit - \nNyle cries out, unleashing his power every 4th ability creating an AoE effect and dealing magic damage. Nyle also loses 2% of his current health. The passive will not occur if he is too low and will die from the health taken away.\n\nThis also puts a 'Mark' on them making abilities do different things (Just to get an idea of what the Mark looks like, it will be a type of stone in the form of a star type thing). If 'Mark' hits an enemies, Nyle gets back 40 / 50 / 60  health.\n\nQ - Earthborn - \nCooldown: 6 / 5 / 4 / 3.75 / 3.5 /\nNyle charges up a line of rock in his hands and then releases it dealing magic damage and slowing enemies by 30% for 1.5 second. If the enemy has a Mark on them, it reduces their magic resist and armour by 20% for 1.5 seconds (Q stops when it hits an enemy. Does not damage minions and goes through them.)\n\nW - Descendant of the Monolith - \nCooldown: 10 / 8 / 7 / 6 / 5 /\nNyle slams his fists into the ground creating a small earthquake in a line dealing magic damage and rooting enemies that have been struck for 1.25 seconds. If the enemy has the Mark on them, they get rooted for an extra .75 seconds.\n\nE - Spirits Bolt - \nCooldown: 10 / 9 / 8 / 7 / 6 / \nNyle plunges to a targeted location, hardening the earth on where he has rolled. If the enemy walks on the hardened earth, they are slowed by 20% for 1 second. If the enemy has a Mark on them, it increases the slow by 40% for 2 seconds.\n\nR - Defenders Wrath - \nCooldown: 1:20 / 1:00 / 45 /\nNyle crackles with rage, unleashing his full potential. Walls are marked in red, showing him which ones he can move. If he selects a red wall, he has the option to throw it, dealing 400 / 600 / 800 damage to an enemy, and slowing them by 20% for 1 second. After the wall has been thrown, it glides back to its normal position, assisted with the power of Nyle. However, if Nyle clicks a non-marked wall, his ult is cancelled, and put on 50% cooldown (Only Nyle can see marked walls, and they also have a small range to be thrown in)\n\nChampion Select Quote:\n\"The defenders will prevail.. No matter the cost.\"\n\nJoke:\n\"Want to see a trick?\"\nLifts up hands\nGround starts to make a weird cracking sound\n\"Thatâ€™s not supposed to happen...\"\n\nTaunt:\nRises a rock from the earth\n\"Try not to. Crack under the pressure.\"\n\"Carrying your team is like carrying the rock. Only i can do it.\"\nSplits the rock in half\n\nDance:\nNyle summons rocks from the ground and juggles them (And maybe whistles?).\n\nMovement Quotes:\n\"They are not grateful.\"\n\"Nothing can prepare them.\"\n\"The war. Must end.\"\n\"I should have saved him when I had the chance.\"\n\"I will take revenge.\"\n\"No dragon is safe from me.\n\"They will pay the ultimate price.\"\n(Give me ideas for more quotes)","replies":[{"poster":"xXlikeicareXx","date":"2016-04-29T07:28:37.304+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"4/4 Abilities have CC... 2 Slows a Root and a Stun?! #notgonnahappen","replies":[{"poster":"wallah fight me","date":"2016-04-29T14:32:30.802+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=xXlikeicareXx,realm=EUW,application-id=hIjvqaz6,discussion-id=bEz6yMaQ,comment-id=0010,timestamp=2016-04-29T07:28:37.304+0000)\n>\n> 4/4 Abilities have CC... 2 Slows a Root and a Stun?! #notgonnahappen\n\nthanks for your opinion\nalthough you see champs like jax yi fiora fizz\nyou never know what rito could release next","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Grozmly","date":"2016-04-28T23:01:50.204+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Talyiah has been announced sooo you can say your design has been noticed (maybe,i dunno)","replies":[{"poster":"wallah fight me","date":"2016-04-29T05:39:17.751+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Grozmly,realm=EUNE,application-id=hIjvqaz6,discussion-id=bEz6yMaQ,comment-id=000f,timestamp=2016-04-28T23:01:50.204+0000)\n>\n> Talyiah has been announced sooo you can say your design has been noticed (maybe,i dunno)\n\nhope so :D","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Fabi0thefabulous","date":"2016-01-11T07:22:29.943+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You've put a lot of time and effort into this, well done, a name suggestion Sed or Sedi (as in sediment, because he uses earthen powers)","replies":[]},{"poster":"SilentXKiller","date":"2015-11-06T06:31:00.836+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You may as well call him Gaea,na jk, just think of a better name...","replies":[{"poster":"wallah fight me","date":"2015-11-07T23:21:19.707+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=SilentXKiller,realm=OCE,application-id=hIjvqaz6,discussion-id=bEz6yMaQ,comment-id=000c,timestamp=2015-11-06T06:31:00.836+0000)\n>\n> You may as well call him Gaea,na jk, just think of a better name...\n\nI like Nyle :D But if you really think it would be better to change the name, then sure.","replies":[{"poster":"SilentXKiller","date":"2015-11-08T09:21:58.377+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"No offense, but the name Nyle sounds to Egypt (Nile River), I think it would probably be better if the name was changed?","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"w0otness","date":"2015-11-08T01:03:36.168+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"A geomancer would be a nice addition...","replies":[]},{"poster":"TeCoolMage","date":"2015-06-29T12:51:47.523+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"20% heal?
