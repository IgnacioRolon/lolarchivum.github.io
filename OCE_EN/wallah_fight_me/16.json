But I am a Video Editor and YouTuber. All in all, it was a good video (entertaining and not too long - albeit a bit short).\n\nSo, from a video editing stand point:\n\n1. Your jump cuts are okay. Not much you can do about that :)\n\n2. At 1:27 you had a very weird and misplaced wiggle (I can tell what you were going for, but it didn't really work out).\n\n3. Also, the 3 second fade to black at 1:23/4 was too long; it ruined the continuity a bit. At most, keep it at around 1 second.\n\n4. Music was good :) Nice and upbeat and suited the montage. However, with the exception of 1:24-28, your montage didn't really sync with the music (i.e. matching a kill on a down-beat, or a lead up to an engage matched with a crescendo).\n\n5. The text. Try to use graphics or fancy texts (like from CoolText.com) instead of regular print (which is okay in vlogs or as subtitles, but not in high action gaming). If you HAVE to, then at least make it colourful (like your first one).\n\n6. I understand that not everyone has something like Sony Vegas Pro or Adobe Premiere, and instead use something like Movie Maker, but try to show a bit more \"creativity\". Using an example from Nightblue3, he frequently has anime interactions in his videos. If you're going for more of the montage stuff (which it looks like you are), look at BoxBox; he has lighting effects and utilises zooms and music very effectively.\n\nAnd now from a YouTubing stand point:\n\n1. Either use a recording software that has less lag, or reduce your graphics (e.g. from high to medium high). Visually, the graphics won't look too different, but you'll definitely hit over 30 FPS. You want AT LEAST 30 FPS in a gaming video, if not 60. Anything more than 60 is a bit of an overkill (unless you're intending on using slow-motion).\n\n2. The title. *Silver Montage - Rumble* is a trivial title. I'm not suggesting something clickbaity like *OMG THE WUKONG COMMITTED SUICIDE AFTER THAT ONE*, but you ought to at least try something that would attract more viewers and create an angle for your video (i.e. *Godlike Rumble Plays - The Mechanised Menice of Silver*). Also, if you want more views, maybe don't mention your rank (since a lot of people see \"Silver\" and think \"bad\"). I'm *not* saying that you should say you're Challenger.\n\n3. Please write better descriptions than \"i got some good ults not gonna lie o_o\". At least spend *some* time on it. That way, it shows that you respect the viewers.\n\n4. In your endcard, your videos were out of sync with the background. Either work on this from a video editing point of view, or use the endcard feature in *Edit* mode.\n\n5. Your thumbnail looks pretty good. Again, try changing the text style so it becomes more appealing :)\n\nThere you go :) Hope this helped :D It was a good video, along with the content in it, so don't worry too much (as long as you have fun) xD I am looking forward to more :)\n\n{{sticker:slayer-jinx-wink}}","replies":[{"poster":"wallah fight me","date":"2017-05-01T11:01:39.614+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thank you for putting the time and effort in writing this, a lot of these points will be taken into consideration. This really helps heaps. With the title of the video, Silver Montage is the kind of series of those videos, which change when i hit the next rank. Im almost gold and im climbing pretty fast so im thinking of making playlists for each rank so people and myself can look back and see how good i was at this time, ect. But I am thinking of still changing up the title a bit, so for example: Silver Montage - Rumble - (whatever). Again thanks for putting your time into giving me these points, helps a lot! :D","replies":[]}]}]}
