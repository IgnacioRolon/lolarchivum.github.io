I even got a S-.\r\n\r\nThen I go on OPGG, update it and my MMR is now 1886?!\r\n\r\nIt&#039;s already infuriating enough that personal prowess and progress isnt taken into account in your LP/MMR gain (from what I know, only losing/winning does) but now, I am even LOSING MMR when winning? \r\n\r\nI would appreciate any insights that you guys can give me because i don&#039;t understand how to climb in low elo in League anymore...\r\n\r\nCheers,\r\nP.","replies":[{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2018-11-25T08:43:10.009+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":1,"body":"MMR found on third party websites like OP.GG are not accurate. They can be used as a guide, and are generally a reasonably reliable indicator of relative skill (you compared to another individual), but they don't use Riot's calculations (those are hidden to prevent abuse cases) so they will never be accurate to the number.","replies":[]},{"poster":"QAPLA","date":"2018-11-26T09:25:04.461+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"What is \"perfect K/D/A\"?\n\nThat's like infinity/zero/infinity, which is impossible.\nPerfection is a concept, it does not exist within the physical universe that we exist in.\n\nYour MMR probably just hadn't updated on the 3rd party site since a few games earlier.\nTo make an analogy, it's like looking at a stopped clock, then wondering why 10 mins later your phone is an hour out from said clock.","replies":[]}]}
