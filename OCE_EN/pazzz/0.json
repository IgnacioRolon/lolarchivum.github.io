I get good KDA&#039;s and usually manage to keep my deaths quite low, and can turn into a second mid-laner when I get a little snowball going. \r\n\r\nI&#039;m not a kid (I&#039;m 30) and pretty chill in-game but focused when in ranked. Got good map awareness and know when to roam and ward enemy jungle. \r\n\r\nI&#039;m looking for someone chill, preferably bot lane (although Jungle would be good synergy as well for roams and ganks), no tilt or flame. Be opened to and provide feedback and at least listen to pings :)\r\n\r\nHit me up in-game if you&#039;re keen, we can do some draft games before going into ranked.\r\n\r\nSee ya in the rift!\r\nP.","replies":[]}
