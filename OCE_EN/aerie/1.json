Oh and also talking about my first Ranked Games ^^","subforum":"Miscellaneous","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"**Hey there hi there ! :)**\n\nI&#039;m back with a new post, this time for MMR and ELO. A friend of mine was explaining what it consisted in but I was on the Rift at the same time and didn&#039;t understand anything at all x) We came to talk about it because (for those who knew me before this post) I finally reached level 30 and started playing ranked.\n\nRanked games though. Here are some of the first thoughts I had in mind when I played my first Ranked games:\n\n&quot;Woop woop! Gonna try something new, can&#039;t wait!&quot;\n&quot;Damn that was long, but finally in the lobby&quot;\n&quot;HOLY MOTHER OF CRAP I THINK I BROKE MY LOL CLIENT! I CAN&#039;T SELECT MY CHAMPION!&quot;\n&quot;Wait are they actually banning champions? Are they seriously banning Urgot? WHY? I&#039;ve never seen him ingame!&quot;\n&quot;Damn it, I don&#039;t even own that many junglers xD&quot;\n&quot;Ah... People fighting over position and &quot;call order&quot; &quot;pick order&quot;. Wondering if people actually want to be useful to a team or just get kills. Which is useful. But not always. I guess. Bah&quot;\n&quot;Damn the pressure. People are WAY bolder in ranked games. Like, seriously? What was this 5v2 at 7 minutes bottom lane? xD&quot;\n&quot;YOUHOUUU I got my first rank ever and it&#039;s not even really representative of me since it won&#039;t count in season 6 :D&quot;\n\nThere you go, I ended up Silver I and now I&#039;m in Gold V :)\n\nBut I still don&#039;t get what MMR and ELO are, can you guys explain? Where and how do I find it? \n\nThere, enough of that, I gotta practice my {{champion:28}} , I seriously suck at playing her.\n\nPS: See you around :D\nPPS: Thank you Riot ^^\nPPPS: Be nice to people!\n\n_**Aerie**_\n{{sticker:slayer-jinx-wink}}","replies":[{"poster":"vicelore","date":"2015-12-04T03:33:11.865+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Please dont play ranked if you just hit 30.","replies":[{"poster":"Aerie","date":"2015-12-04T04:05:32.332+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Please don't leave comments that have nothing to do with what I asked. :) \nPS: I do whatever the hell I want xD","replies":[{"poster":"CyanPhoenix","date":"2015-12-04T05:26:11.650+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"considering you're initial rank was silver 1, you must be better than at least half of everyone else who just hit level 30. i think at that point you're allowed to do what ever the hell you want :)","replies":[{"poster":"Aerie","date":"2015-12-04T05:37:30.927+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hah that's nice of you to say that, though I don't think I'm \"better\", I just have more fun and I don't forget the essential: games are for fun, let's miss some Creeps here and there with {{champion:21}} , just better show dem enemies how a well timed Bullet Time hurts and laugh in synch ^^\nSee you around buddy :)\n\n{{sticker:slayer-jinx-catface}}","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Highland Cow","date":"2015-12-04T04:29:36.114+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey there,\n\nMMR and Elo are pretty much the same thing, which is a system used to calculate a player's skill level. The match making system looks at all your wins and losses and the converts this into a number - the system then matches you with other players with a similar number.\n\nThat's a pretty basic explanation - you can find out more here:\n\nhttps://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752954-Matchmaking-Guide\n\nBut seriously - you just turned level 30 and you're gold already?

A fresh account that just hit lv 30 will have 1.2k MMR which is an indication for Silver V ( MMR might varies depend on sever) ; every win in ranked in a provisional match would get you 40-80 MMR/ELO, MMR/ELO does not show ingame but can be guessed through various site eg. op.gg .\n\nMost people say \"you shouldn't play ranked as soon as you hit lv 30\" are people who reckon you are not ready, as someone who don't know you I would recommend the same , but it's my opinion and you don't have to listen to it. It's better to play normal imo for a little while since you can hone your skill that way which prepare you for rank, you said you achieved Silver I after ranked which would mean you either went 6/4 or 7/3 in placements\n\nI think what Vicelore trying to say is if you practice or have enough game sense, you could have reach higher then Silver I as a placements , i'm not belittling you but I think he was referencing from all of the above.\n\nNote : How did you play 107 ranked games w/ 50% win rate if you only got to lv 30?","replies":[{"poster":"Aerie","date":"2015-12-04T20:26:18.080+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Aaah I see what you mean now. But you know, I'm only playing ranked because it's not going to be official and I'm having a lot of fun playing \"like it's competition\". I told my friends I would not play ranked games for next season because I want to earn all the champions first. Then, I'll eventually start playing ranked for real competition. Pre season is cool like that.\nAnd I usually win with Miss Fortune and Malphite in ranked, and I'm quite good with the both of them. Their teamfight is insane ^^","replies":[]}]}]}
