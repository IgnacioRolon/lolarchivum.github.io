I&#039;m looking for people who main these champions:\r\n\r\nTop: Irelia\r\nJungle: Master Yi\r\nMid: Syndra\r\nADC: Varus.\r\n\r\nI&#039;m mainly looking for gold and silver players. If you&#039;re interested in having some games, add me and/or comment this post so we can discuss this! Also, the composition of the Ionian team can AND must be debated. Not everyone will agree that Syndra and Karma on the same team is believable considering their backgrounds and ideals. \r\nThere you go, see y&#039;all around and good luck on the rift! \r\n\r\n{{sticker:slayer-jinx-catface}} \r\nAerie","replies":[{"poster":"Talon12","date":"2015-12-27T11:35:43.626+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"screw. master. yi.\n\nonly sad people with no life use him, let alone main him.\n\nlee jungle much better. also adds some more tank to the team.\n\nshen zed yasuo lee akali kennen soraka bard(somewhat because he came to the world through ionia)","replies":[{"poster":"Lord Sesshomaru","date":"2015-12-27T20:37:25.277+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Id much rather have a Yi jungle than a Lee (even though i hate both of them)\njust because lee has such a high pick rate I'm so fucking bored of having 2 Lee-sin's in EVERY game! plz variety RIOT!!","replies":[{"poster":"Talon12","date":"2015-12-28T05:56:09.389+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"then have xin zhao.","replies":[{"poster":"Zorphiax","date":"2015-12-28T15:10:28.767+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Why not have Udyr he is an Ionian and he way better then Yi and Lee Sin.","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Lord Sesshomaru","date":"2015-12-27T10:43:12.641+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Top: Yasuo\nJung: Yi\nMid: Zed\n\noops you you've already won you don't even need ADC or Supp :S\n\nbut i like how you're making a themed team! id love to make a Shuriman one and have a war! if only i had the time tho xD","replies":[]},{"poster":"Zorphiax","date":"2015-12-27T10:31:27.820+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I love Irelia count me in.\n\nOnly problem with an Ionian team is that you have to have Varus adc there is no other 'good' adc.","replies":[]}]}
