Whatever. This post is a call for respect and, with this call, come some questions to Riot Games. I am no one to complain about any bad comments because I usually do not care and mute any negativity. But recently, I have paid more attention to some of the comments that are made during games, and the gravity of what is said is actually alarming. I once decided it was not worth muting one player because we needed everyone to know what was going on, and the only things that came out of it was &quot;die of cancer irl a**hole&quot; or &quot;f**k ur mum&quot;. I don&#039;t care if you believe me or not, but I am a 24 years old girl with breasts cancer and seeing people wishing each other cancer during my games, right after my chemotherapy sessions is just heartbreaking and disrespectful, because some of the people actually don&#039;t know what it means to have cancer and  to fight it every day, to feel it in your chest and lungs and not knowing how to get it out. I also have too much respect for parents to ever allow these kind of comments to go unpunished. League is actually my only consolation... and quite sadly the only thing I&#039;m looking forward to when I get home, tired or not. Most of my friends don&#039;t have much time to hang out  with me because they have lives to live and things to do, and I cannot even think of trying to find a job anymore in these conditions. \r\nI&#039;m gonna be honest, I haven&#039;t been an exemplary player either, out of fatigue sometimes I would be very EXTREMELY mean to some of my allies... Which is not me. Not in a billion years. The real goal of this post is to know if the chat REALLY is that important to play this game? I realized during most of the games I&#039;ve played that the comments that are made through really long conversations are not constructive at all during the game since the players are focused on nagging and harrassing each other. Also, it is really all a matter of pings at some point, it would be more interesting if pings were also more elaborate, because 4 of them is not enough. I don&#039;t know, it&#039;s just an idea I&#039;m throwing out there, because yeah, I am sad and don&#039;t wish to see\r\nI&#039;m usually a happy player, but right now I&#039;m a little bit heartbroken. But thank you Riot for this amazing game, and keep p with the good work :) A number one fan ^^\r\nPS: I love this song, when you read the lyrics, it tells my story from the time I traveled in New Zealand  then France for my studies and then got back home in New Caledonia :) Good times ^^{{sticker:slayer-jinx-catface}} \r\nPPS: I&#039;m sorry for my English if it&#039;s repetitive sometimes, I&#039;m too tired to find elaborate words.\r\nSee y&#039;all around &lt;3\r\n\r\n**_Aerie_**","replies":[{"poster":"Tele","date":"2015-12-26T11:42:23.488+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"We all sympathise with your situation, and wish you only the best in your struggle with your illness.\n\nAs for your in-game problem, I assure you these players will be punished. Our current automated tribunal system is very good at picking up verbal abuse. In the future I suggest you continue to mute and report players because chat wont be going anywhere. It's been here since the beta, and despite the verbal abuse it enables, it's used positively far more often.","replies":[]}]}
