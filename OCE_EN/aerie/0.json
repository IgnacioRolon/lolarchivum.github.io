I learn new things about my laning phase and stuff, and I see the game in a new light! So this post is basically a big thank you to Riot for all the fun! I&#039;ve had my best game EVER 10 minutes ago with Astanio and John Cleese, two other summoners, and I got SMASHED real good hahaha 4 14 something, but man, that was so intense I can tell I never had this much fun playing against all these Diamonds and Platiniums :)\n\nSee y&#039;all around, I&#039;m heading back to the rift!\n\nAerie","replies":[{"poster":"Fitzky","date":"2015-11-17T10:29:11.436+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":0,"body":"Because of the intense amount of negativity on the boards I feel really weird reading this...","replies":[{"poster":"Aerie","date":"2015-11-18T01:16:17.143+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Here, have a smile, never feel weird for appreciating something :)\nUnless it's eating babies.

Those people are a rarity, most players in that skill bracket could not give a fuck about new players trying to learn and would rather make things harder for you because they don't want other people to succeed or inspire them to try.\n\nYou will come across players on both sides that will just rip into you, when both your team and opposing team gang up to make you feel like worthless trash. Remember this is a game, not a \"sport\" as so many people try and say because no sport in the fucking world lets people get away with the level of crap that gets heaped onto some of us by this entitled crapsack excuse of a playerbase.\n\nDon't pay for pixels.
