I started playing when Kindred was being teased and have since then fought my way on the damn ladder. Like for real, I don&#039;t know how many ranked games I&#039;ve had, but way too many just to end this season in Gold 5. I&#039;m happy though, as this is my first official season, but as everyone, I want to go further. I&#039;ve discovered my main champion is Janna{{champion:40}}  and I am looking forward to find an ADC main that is willing to climb the ladder with me. For next season, I&#039;m aiming to reach Platinium, and maybe Diamond the season after, who knows? :)\r\nAnyways, I want to thank all the people I have played with until now, all the trolls{{champion:17}} , the non-trolls, the friends and enemies. Thank you for making the struggle real and the reward more... rewarding. I have a new champion, a skin that goes along with it AND a Gold Banner for my games ascreen :&#039;)\r\nAlso thank you Rito for the cool game, I&#039;ll try to be less salty this next season lol\r\n\r\nSee ya xoxo\r\n\r\nAerie {{sticker:slayer-jinx-wink}}","replies":[]}
