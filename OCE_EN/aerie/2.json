I mean IRL and ingame too x) \r\n\r\n\r\nI would love to find other players like me, that are pretty new. I&#039;m on vacation at the moment and stuck at home because I had an accident (nothing serious, just can&#039;t walk for at least a month =_=). Anyways, I&#039;m level 22, I&#039;m pretty good at poking/teamfights champions. My two favourites remain **Miss Fortune** {{champion:21}}  and **Karma** {{champion:43}} . I&#039;m told to be a decent and respectful player. I&#039;m from New Caledonia and am wondering if there other Caledonian players on here? I speak French, Spanish and English (French is my mother tongue). There you go! Add me if you want to have fun with me, we might even become good friends who knows?\r\n\r\nXoxo {{sticker:slayer-jinx-wink}} \r\n\r\n_**Aerie**_","replies":[{"poster":"Hypnotits","date":"2015-11-11T07:58:19.642+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Well hello there Aerie\nEvan here\nI'm not really good at this but ok lmao\nJust add meh in game if you wanna be friends :D -Hypnotits {{sticker:slayer-pantheon-rainbows}}","replies":[{"poster":"Aerie","date":"2015-11-11T18:52:24.003+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Haha I loled at your summoner name x) I just added you!
