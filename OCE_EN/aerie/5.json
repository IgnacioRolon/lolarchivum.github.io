It seems like it has a link with their deep desires. The theme of the new champion could be related to dreams and wishes? I made some research and found out later on Reddit that there are some files named after Jhin on the PBE server. And Jhin sort of reminds me of Djinn, some sort of genie that grants wishes. Could be. Or not. Whatever x) Tell me what you think!\r\n\r\nHugs&#039;n&#039;Kisses,\r\n\r\nAerie\r\n{{sticker:slayer-jinx-wink}}","replies":[{"poster":"Junko","date":"2016-01-04T06:56:00.100+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"Well there ya go! I never knew it could be a reference to Djinn - a genie xD That's an awesome concept and if the champ is anything like a genie I'll definitely be buying it!\n{{sticker:slayer-jinx-catface}}","replies":[{"poster":"Aerie","date":"2016-01-04T07:13:50.166+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"I know right? :D \nThough I have no idea how wishes could work.

A Jinn is a spirit who is able to possess humans. A Genie is a spirit imprisoned in a bottle/lamp who grants wishes when released.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"lordofrage","date":"2016-01-04T15:21:18.575+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"but i think since theres 4 of em possible that its his abilities like his q to his r idk haha","replies":[]},{"poster":"lordofrage","date":"2016-01-04T15:19:01.352+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"an zed sona garen an vi are dead","replies":[]},{"poster":"lordofrage","date":"2016-01-04T15:18:22.136+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"jhin deadeye will come around i think around patch 6.2 or something","replies":[]},{"poster":"Chicken4dinner","date":"2016-01-04T09:07:18.651+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The teasers you saw have been dubbed \"dead eye\"","replies":[{"poster":"Talon12","date":"2016-01-04T11:36:12.999+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"jhin-deadeye","replies":[]}]}]}
