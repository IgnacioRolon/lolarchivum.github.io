Just wanted to know is anyone else getting REALLY bad lag with OCE servers?  I feel like I&#039;m the only one because no one else complains about it.  I stopped playing league for a few weeks because it got so bad at one point.  I came back to play a few games last night and it was fine and then played ranked today because I thought I was safe.  Nope it hit like a truck again.  200 ping when ever I make a movement, 8,000 ping when I kill a jungle creep.  Constant d/cing and didn&#039;t even get a loss prevention as usual.  It&#039;s not my side because I literally turned off everything at one point including my anti-virus and checked to make sure nothing was running in the background through task manager and still lagged.\n\nCan anyone help? I wanna be able to play ranked again without screwing over my team.\n\nEDIT: It happens in normals too.","replies":[{"poster":"HORSE OF FORCE","date":"2015-05-29T12:27:24.506+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":">didn't even get a loss prevention as usual\n\nYou mean that you usually get a loss prevented when this happens?\n\nAnyway, what ISP are you with? Do you get this lag when you do other internet related activities too? What OS are you on?","replies":[]}]}
