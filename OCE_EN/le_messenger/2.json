My little brother patched his and said it was small and quick but that doesn&#039;t seem to be the case.  I&#039;ve gotten up to 20,000 files scanned. I have never seen that before and it has never taken this long before (being stuck at 33%) even for massive patches.  Is this happening to anyone else?  If so, how do I fix it?\r\n\r\nCheers, \r\n\r\nMessenger","replies":[{"poster":"SephirothSG","date":"2016-04-04T01:29:11.094+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey there,\n\nSorry for the late reply.\n\nIs it still stuck? did you allow it to run to completion?\n\nIf you're still experiencing this issue, could you please download the [Hextech Toolkit](https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/player-support/tools/HTK_Setup.msi) and force a repatch from there.","replies":[]}]}
