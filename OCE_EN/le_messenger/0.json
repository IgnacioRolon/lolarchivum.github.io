Like I can chase him up the lane auto attacking him in bear stance for what feels like forever and I can&#039;t stun him on hit?  I thought Pantheon&#039;s passive blocks the first auto.\r\n\r\nSecondly I can&#039;t stun Jax when he uses his E either - same thing, blocks the damage from the auto... fair enough. But now I can&#039;t stun him either?  And he can stun me AND jump away? I feel like Udyr just got hit with the nerf hammer hard or maybe something is broken? How can I peel for my ADC when carries like this can block my stuns while stunning me?  Where&#039;s the reward for engaging or tanking for the team?  All I know is that with this, on top of the nerfs to his pheonix stance, even the new jungle item isn&#039;t enough to make Udyr useful anymore.  After 3 seasons I think I&#039;ve actually lost interest in playing Udyr... and he&#039;s practically the only reason I love playing League of Legends, haha... Nah that&#039;s a lie but a big reason.\r\n\r\nAnyway any answers would be appreciated. I wish I could provide more examples (because I know there were a few others) but I can&#039;t think of more off the top of my head. Is this just a nerf to his E or a buff to some other champions or something broken?\r\n\r\nThanks, \r\n\r\nMessenger","replies":[{"poster":"Taric Main","date":"2016-05-16T11:56:24.294+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Because your auto actually procs the stun, anything that blocks it ie Panth's Aegis, Jax E, Shen w etc if they block the auto they effectively block the stun. \n\nMy tip for panth is go turtle/phoenix to break it then switch to Bear and then stun. Jax is a bit harder but you're best kiting away in bear until he either uses his jump or the stun goes off. \n\nIt's mainly about timing just knowing when to use it etc :)","replies":[{"poster":"Le Messenger","date":"2016-05-16T14:27:39.385+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Appreciate the reply man! Actually what I'm saying though is that I got the auto off on Panth and the stun doesn't work, Ok.  But then the stun doesn't go off still for the auto attacks following that for a short (but feels like a very long) period of time.  That's why I was wondering if it was broken or something?  Anyway just wanted to know if this ability was buggy but it must be normal... Maybe I'm just playing against better players these days...","replies":[{"poster":"Mozzie25","date":"2016-05-16T22:20:35.820+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'm not sure this is right but I would assume it has something to do with the fact you can't apply the stun for six seconds on a champ after stunning them. As D1va noted above the auto procs the stun even though Panth blocks it. So then you can't stun him again for 6 seconds.","replies":[{"poster":"Taric Main","date":"2016-05-17T04:17:40.532+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"As mentioned here although the stun doesn't work, it still puts it on the 6 second CD for the stun. \n\nYour best bet would be to auto in another stance (usually I do Turtle/Phoenix) as I can still get some utility from them while still being able to bait/stall the AA blocking mechanics. \n\nTurtle is usually good against say Jax etc as it will give you a shield for some of his damage, while the phoenix lets you put out some damage while they block it. \n\nFrom memory they don't block the 3rd AA Phoenix so you can still get some damage off that way, then swap to bear stun > and your preferred Udyr combo.","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Le Messenger","date":"2016-05-22T12:20:47.732+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thanks for that guys, yeah I forgot about the 6 seconds.
