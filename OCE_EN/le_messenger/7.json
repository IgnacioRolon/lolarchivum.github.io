Please don't assume that this post will be full of hate because it is followed by a bunch of analysing people's KDA's and blah blah.  It is all to validate my thoughts on the subject and not intended to blame my loss on any individual.\n\nMy last game had a duo queue - Jinx and Sona.  Jinx is Bronze IV with 60+ games and is currently below the 50% win rate while Sona is Silver II 260+ games with around about 50% win rate.  I get that they&#039;re mates and one wants to carry the other, great.  However, Jinx has a horrible KDA with Jinx so why he plays her in ranked, God knows.  Because of their partnership the match making gods tilt the favour ever so slightly against the entire team even further. An Olaf who is not only UNRANKED, but he has lost 8/10 provisionals. The first thing he says when he gets into the game is &quot;First time Olaf.&quot; Our Karma is Silver V with a pretty average KDA and around about 50% win rate of 160+ games which is fine.  I&#039;m Bronze II playing Shyvana with win rate of about 50% in 260+ games too. Their team?\n\nAnnie - Silver 5 with 140+ games and slightly under 50% win rate.\nSoraka - Bronze II with 120+ games at around about 50% win rate.\nGraves - Bronze II with 110+ games, a good deal above 50% win rate.\nAshe - Silver 5 with 150+ games with around about 50% win rate.\nMalphite - Bronze II with 130+ games and a little under 50% win rate.\n\n3 of their champions had incredibly decent KDA&#039;s, besides Soraka (because this person clearly didn&#039;t play Soraka much in ranked but was pretty good with her regardless) and Ashe who had a terrible KDA  - however, she was vs&#039;ing Jinx, so. \n\nYes it was a horrible game and yes it is in the past - if you check my match history I just fed at the end because I stopped caring about the win.  I purposely avoid queueing up with a partner because I KNOW THIS IS HOW MATCH MAKING WORKS. I don&#039;t want to be matched up with duo queues and I don&#039;t want to play with a partner because I know how the game instantly becomes unfair as a result. That&#039;s why I joined ranked solo.  I hit Play Game expecting a balanced game of RANKED (yes, a competitive mode) and got a game that was clearly unfair because of SOMEONE ELSE&#039;S DECISION to queue with a partner. Furthermore I am not exaggerating at all when I say every single game with a duo queue on my team has been lost.  EVERY. GAME!  No it is not solely a result of the duo! Yes it has a hell of a lot to do with my mistakes as well as other people in the team, however, the teams are obviously unfair in every game where the dynamic duo are involved.\n\nAnd the point I am trying to make by laying out the details of the player&#039;s stats on each team is that their team reflects consistency and experience while ours reflects inexperience (for the most part.)  This is basically a long winded post to say, finally, that I agree with everyone else in saying that I hate the freaking dynamic queue.  When you demean the value of a competitive mode so that players can enjoy playing with their friends, not only for them but for EVERYONE ON THEIR TEAM, in a COMPETITIVE mode, how the hell does that make ranked enjoyable? I&#039;m literally in the shittiest division of the game and I hate it.  I can only imagine how people in higher divisions feel about having to climb with dynamic queue.  \n\nYou know what would be an awesome feature? If portraits were lit up with the people who joined as a group.  So I can dodge the fuck out of that lobby.  K, thanks.","replies":[]}
