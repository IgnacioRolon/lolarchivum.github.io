OCE player here.\n\nSo League of Legends has been freezing to the point where I can't **alt + tab** or **ctrl + alt + delete.**  Literally frozen and I have to hold the power button, restart and login again to play.  I just recently bought this **laptop**, and when I first started getting this problem I'd come back to the login screen sometimes and the T&amp;C's would appear and for some reason the region would change itself to NA region.  When it freezes** I can't hear anything.**  Even if I have music on in the background, that also stops.\n\nWhat usually happens is I play for 5-20 minutes and my laptop completely freezes.  Usually happens during team fights; not all team fights but that tends to be when it happens.  The other day my brother turned off the power which consequently turned off the modem and that froze the game too.  A simple disconnect froze it.  I've never experienced this before.\n\nThings I've done to solve this issue: \n\n**1. Re-installed the game.**\n**2. Updated my graphics drivers (despite the only updates available being for wireless devices and Bluetooth.)**\n**3. Ran the fix tool in the League of Legends client settings (forgot the name.)**\n**4. Ran League of Legends bugsplat program.**\n**5. Reduced the graphics settings from medium-high to low.**\n\nAfter doing this I still had the same issue with freezing, however it no longer came up with the T&amp;C's at login and doesn't automatically switch to NA region.  The freezes became less frequent (once every 2-3 games).  I just turned my graphics up to medium-high again and_ it froze twice in 10 minutes._\n\nComputer specs: \n\n**Windows 10 Home Edition 64-bit**\n**Intel HD Graphics 620**\n**8GB Ram**\n**Intel Core i7-7500U 2.7GHz**\n\nConstantly runs at 60FPS and 30 ping even at medium-high settings.","replies":[{"poster":"Endsification","date":"2019-01-01T17:02:37.017+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I have the same problem.\nFreezes, cant crt alt delet, or alt tab. Only way is restarting, holding power button. Happens few times in a week. Most annoiying to it is, that after the restart i open client and it changed region, when i rechange it, it starts to download, which lasts  10 minutes or more. I guess its regional download or smth. So the game is insta loss and i have 9 reports. So this is completely \"spat in the face\" emotion over here.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Yarrgonaut","date":"2018-02-09T19:58:27.323+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I have had the exact same issue.

I still have this issue.  Even if no one can help me, could someone at least refer me to someone that can please?  I was showing my niece how to play in a custom game today and it froze again after 5 minutes, so it seems to be random...","replies":[]},{"poster":"Quickdraw03","date":"2019-01-25T06:53:33.017+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I am experiencing the same thing and the repair tool does not help. Either the game freezes upon trying to load from the lobby or it freezes in game. Task manager populates, but I cannot alt+tab to anything. Now all I can do is ctr+alt+del and sign out and sign back in. Thankfully I finally figured out this works after many hard resets. This is the only game on the computer I have any issues with. This has been at least 5 months now and I have had to come back from many negative reports and \"low priority queue\" which isn't even a queue, just a long wait before actually queuing you. What gives Riot? How have you not addressed this?","replies":[]},{"poster":"SephirothSG","date":"2017-07-01T04:57:54.492+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey there,\n\nTry running the game at a lower resolution and/or in windowed mode.
