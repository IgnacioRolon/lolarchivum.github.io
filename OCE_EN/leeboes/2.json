I propose 2 modes &quot;hero siege&quot; from warcraft 3 where waves attack your castle and you must defend a &quot;heros home castle&quot; or a new empire in which you can choose a hero at the beginning and gear it up in the same way, progressing through the stretched terrain until you meet the boss and bosses casting different things over the map, players have to dodge and work together to heal, tank and fight making it that people communicate in the game and get badges and gear rewards as they progress the boss stages, bosses could be anything from the lair of chogath to the stories of each individual character and raiding them in their own element for their delicious loot and gearing your character and level in a story mode.\r\n\r\nJust remember some of us don&#039;t know the stories including myself unless it is drummed into me through gameplay.\r\n\r\nI would even pay a 10 dollar premium for this side.\r\n\r\nWhat are your thoughts?","replies":[]}
