They ruin player experience but most importantly make your game more of a chore than anything else.\r\n\r\nFirst you ranking system is terrible. How can you skew your player base to the left when intelligence is fit to a normal curve? This tells me your developers are on the bottom half of the curve. You need more tiers, there is no way ~70% of players belong in bronze and silver. Some may argue that you can get out with hard work, but you also need to play a lot, as the odds are not in your favour. The majority of people who play this game don&#039;t have this time to spend on LoL and so it&#039;s ridiculous to assume everyone can do this.\r\n\r\nSecond is your MMR system. The same thing happened with WoW arena. You are given an MMR and as your ELO approaches this number your LP/ELO gains taper off. While this is a good idea, it&#039;s useless if your system does not account for player improvement, which it doesn&#039;t. How can you continually taper of someones LP gain per win after they&#039;ve been on a 5+ win streak? You are basically saying, &quot;Good work on improving but we don&#039;t care, you belong in x&quot;. These first two points are the crux of the matter.\r\n\r\nMy last point is more opinionated. If you want to implement a draft system where people have to pre-pick their desired roles, please follow up by making sure a) they have a sufficient amount of champs to fulfill that role (i.e. if someone queues for adc, they have at least 3 adc champs) b) restrict them to choosing champs that belong to that category. While you may initially think, &quot;Well hold on, how can you restrict mid/top/jg?&quot;, the answer is you can&#039;t, but you can remove ADC/Support from their pools. This may be something that can be lifted at higher tiers where players are more intuitive and can play a wider variety of champs more flexibly, but for lower tiers it would be a good thing. Too many times I&#039;ve see annie supports and teemo supports, etc.","replies":[{"poster":"JasonWazza","date":"2016-05-20T13:30:48.330+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":">but you can remove ADC/Support from their pools.\n\nGraves can be a jungler, Quinn can be a jungler, Vayne can be a top laner, Ezreal can be a mid laner.\n\nSo there is no point restricting things, if people get to high/low rank with Janna Mid, then let them, it's not your choice.\n\n>Too many times I've see annie supports and teemo supports\n\nAnnie is a support, and has been for like 3 seasons, and again, it's not your choice as to what other people are allowed to play.","replies":[]},{"poster":"mowzeh","date":"2016-05-20T06:57:34.041+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I meant number of games with all other things being equal. That is, if two people are trying to climb rank and one plays 20 hours per week and the other 40 hours. The person who plays 40 hours will most likely see success as opposed to the 20 hour per week. This is a probabilistic argument and is supported by the homogenisation of widely varying skill levels into two tiers (bronze and silver.).\n\nIf anything Nightblue3 plays right into my point. This guy is a full-time youtuber who plays a load of league, and go figure with that much time he is successful. Also the comparison of a challenger climbing from bronze to a bronze player climbing bronze is void. These are two different things, apples and oranges.\n\nLP gain does taper. A friend and I were both playing games duo, and for a win I would receive ~10 LP and he would receive ~20LP, we were both in B4 at the time.\n\nI know the minimum total champs owned is 16, I am referring to specific roles. As in, if you want to choose your role as ADC in draft pick before you queue, you need a minimum of 3 adc champs. I have never seen people in a draft pick change roles based on team comp, it only ever happens when someone doesn't get what they want and they ask to switch with something. It never has anything to do with strategy. The point of restricting is so you don't have people playing champs in roles they are not supposed to be in, e.g. annie or teemo support, and end up ruining the game for everyone else. It also pushes people to play the role properly and hence learn it properly. Going even further I'd say support should be limited to buying support items in shop. Great way to teach low ELO players what to buy. There are far too many supports building AP or AD or full tank, and they NEVER purchase a sightstone.","replies":[]},{"poster":"RonyStark","date":"2016-05-20T04:36:06.626+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=mowzeh,realm=OCE,application-id=FjGAIbRv,discussion-id=co95msbK,comment-id=,timestamp=2016-05-20T02:02:43.499+0000)\n>\n> Some may argue that you can get out with hard work, but you also need to play a lot, as the odds are not in your favour.\n\nWrong. The number of games you have played does not reflect your rank.\nIt is more about understanding of the game, the play, yourself (emotion control), quick decision making, planning, team leading and many more.\nI recommend you to watch Nightblue3 youtube videos or other challengers who play Bronze to Challenger in a matter of days or weeks.\n\nI have many friends who have played LoL longer than me (5 years maybe) and their ranks are below me.\n \n> Second is your MMR system.
