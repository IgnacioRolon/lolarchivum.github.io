We queue together in the hopes of trying to get out of bronze but unfortunately we cannot control all factors in a game. We are looking for players to queue with us on a regular basis to climb out of bronze.\r\n\r\nWe are by no means the best players, but, we understand each role in the game. We ward strategically, and are objective driven. We are looking for like minded players who can improve and communicate in game to put together successive wins.\r\n\r\nIf this sounds like you and you are interested please add me ingame.","replies":[{"poster":"hivy1998","date":"2016-05-27T02:48:55.056+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Add me","replies":[]},{"poster":"TheOneMaddy","date":"2016-05-21T00:39:30.402+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'm S5 but struggling to get points with all the feeders.

Like you I was Bronze last 2 seasons, slowly getting better but not out of Bronze. This season I finally got out of Bronze with consistent gameplay and always having side lanes pushing. I've discovered a few other quirks Bronze players tend to have and was able to exploit these. Perhaps I can help you, just add me.","replies":[]},{"poster":"hybridz","date":"2016-05-18T05:02:09.868+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'm in the same boat, with many things like this, but don't que up with 5 people you end up facing other premades a fair bit, its best to just try to snowball with a combo that works, like Jungle top, or mid jungle. And apply map pressure where needed, wardings is great I'm keen to team up with you if u want to do 3s but any more than that and u get premades","replies":[]},{"poster":"RonyStark","date":"2016-05-18T03:24:57.735+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"i have helped many friends to silver by duoing.\nAdd me.
