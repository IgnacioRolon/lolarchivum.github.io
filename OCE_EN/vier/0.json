Read the quoted post from dartagnan below for more info and a potential fix.\n\n>We've been tracking an issue with this patch where players who have the patcher pinned (instead of the desktop shortcut) to their Windows Task Bar consistently crash/Bug Splat when they attempt to get into a game after Champ Select. We are working on a hotfix ASAP, but there is a temporary work around to get this solved:\n\n\n>1. Un-pin League of Legends from your task bar.\n2. Use the patcher's \"Repair\" tool (click the question mark in the upper right-hand corner).\n3. Launch League normally\n4. If this still doesn't work, you can also just completely [re-install League of Legends](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/202539040-Reinstalling-League-of-Legends)\n\n>We'll update everyone once we get more info about the hotfix!","replies":[{"poster":"Vier","date":"2016-07-30T07:05:58.531+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Done all those fixes, still experience the crash.
