Normally, because my ping was fine and at its normal level, I&#039;d assume this was just an issue with my rig not being able to handle the graphical changes and my needing to upgrade, but it has never ever had a problem with running League before, and it handles all my other games well enough. And it wasn&#039;t random drops, or just dropping when lots of stuff was happening on screen either, it was the entire twenty minutes of hell at 3fps, sometimes 4, sometimes 2, never anything higher. Which seems weird to me. I was just wondering if anyone else is experiencing fps issues from the new patch or if I really just do need an upgrade?","replies":[{"poster":"Buttsubushi","date":"2017-12-09T02:59:37.965+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"This might be a long shot but when you downloaded the patch it might have fragmented the new league files, especially if the harddrive league is on is getting close to full. Defragment if you know how to do that, if that doesnt help you might have to do a clean install from leagues login screen.","replies":[]},{"poster":"JasonWazza","date":"2017-12-09T02:28:17.573+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"There has been optimisation issues since the pre-season started (even from Pro's on high end rigs) which cause massive frame drops.\n\nIt's not to do with your rig, it legitmately just happens some games some of the time in league.","replies":[]}]}
