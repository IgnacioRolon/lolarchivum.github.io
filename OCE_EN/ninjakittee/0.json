I live and play with him, and I know he&#039;s not a particularly toxic player, nor does he afk or int or anything like that, and he&#039;s not had any ban warnings before now. The ban notification says his behaviour was apparently severe enough to remain banned until next February, but I know for a fact he hasn&#039;t done anything like that - nor does he boost or script, nor did he sell/purchase his account.\r\n\r\nHe also doesn&#039;t even have _access_ to his account right now (password is incorrect and password reset isn&#039;t working) so we think he might have been hacked (unless that&#039;s just part of how being banned works, neither of us have ever been banned before). He contacted Riot support and gave the requested evidence and was promptly asked to supply additional evidence - first RP purchase, first 3100, 4800, and 6300 ip champ purchased, and what he spent refund tokens on. His account is at least five years old and he&#039;s spent around $3000 in RP on it, so of course he doesn&#039;t remember any of those.\r\n\r\nWhat do?","replies":[{"poster":"Mozzie25","date":"2017-05-29T02:58:18.174+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Just do your best to answer the questions and give them as much info as possible.
