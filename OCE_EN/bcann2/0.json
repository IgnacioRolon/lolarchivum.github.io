Maybe if a player Disconnects and doesn&#039;t rejoin under the 10-15 minute mark then you either get loss prevented or there&#039;s somewhere you can reclaim the lost LP. There would obviously be some restrictions such as you cannot reclaim if someone just had a bad game.\r\n I just had a game (before posting this) where a Gnar fed the entire game, gave free devourer stacks and gold to the other team and in no way at all helped the team. \r\nIt just really bugs me that i lose so much LP because one person ruins the game for everyone. \r\nI&#039;ve also had to dodge multiple games because of trolls doing double jungle or trolls picks such as Soraka top or Urgot jungle and i get punished by losing LP and getting a ban timer.\r\nTo recap, I believe that there should be a better loss prevented system or a way to reclaim lost League Points if someone afk&#039;s or intentionally feeds.","replies":[{"poster":"Omni Presents","date":"2015-09-24T03:46:09.167+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"That Gnar may just be bad andOOOHHHMYGOD! How? I mean, really, how? I didn't think you could die 32 times in a game even when you are trying to feed. The 1 minute spawn timers along with the time it takes to get to an enemy and die, that in 37 minutes means it could be possible.\n\nOn top of that WTF is he building? Zero damage items, no tank items, no support items, just crap.\n\nI can guarantee you this, SOMEONE here will come along and say the following usual shit:\n1. You have the same chance of getting a troll as the enemy\n2. You could have played better and carried harder\n3. Stop blaming others for your lose\n\nLooking at that game I would say Gnar was the support, so dying some can help the team, but with 1 assist, he didn't do anything useful at all. Even when I do support and play super aggressive I don't die that much.\n\nSwain was your mid and sucked ass just as much, 60 CS in 37 minutes is pathetic. I just got a game with 257 CS in 35 minutes and we had an AFK for about 25 of those minutes, I have gone upwards of 400 in that time.\n\nBut you know what? No matter how good you are, no matter how good any of us are, truth be told and I don't give a fuck what ANYONE says, if you have a fucknut twat like that Gnar and to a degree that Swain, god forbid you get this game with both of them, YOU CANNOT CARRY YOUR TEAM! That is a virtual 4v5 game with that Gnar.","replies":[{"poster":"Bcann2","date":"2015-09-24T04:11:48.264+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I only went bad that game was because that Gnar came into my lane and fed my Lux. Then i had the Leona come up and gank me. After that point, I just stuck to my Vayne who was trying her hardest to carry and i would sacrifice myself for her to live. \nAlso this is meant to be a team game, in LCS they dont keep playing if someone disconnects, they pause the game as they know it's only fair if each team has the same amount players. Sometimes you may be able to win a 4v5, but sometimes no matter how hard you try, you cannot carry every game you play.","replies":[{"poster":"Your Neighbour","date":"2015-09-30T23:24:14.690+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I have not seen loss prevented on OCE before. Loss prevented did occur to me on EUW when rampant feeding went on, also occurs on heavy AFKs, how is it that the same standard does not apply in OCE?\n\nBut yeh should have been loss prevented to be honest, 32 death from gnar in a 37 minute game shows that he has just gone out, died, spawned and died again.

Just because we don't have the biggest population doesn't mean we should be overlooked. I have only witnessed one loss prevention on OCE and that's when 7 or the 10 players disconnected. I think maybe if we got more attention maybe we could have a better standard of gaming, but as always, companies focus on what gets them revenue...

Dying to save someone for no reason is half the reason you lose.","replies":[{"poster":"KidConfucius","date":"2015-09-24T06:59:06.970+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"nobody can carry hard enough to make up for a 32 death feeder , no matter how much safer the rest of your team tries to play. its simply too great an advantage that the feeder has given to your opponents. the opposition team would have to be completely brain dead if they couldnt win off all the free kills that gnar gave up.","replies":[{"poster":"DamnationsHound","date":"2015-09-24T08:43:54.705+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I agree, if someone feeds to that degree then there is almost no chance of winning.","replies":[{"poster":"Your Neighbour","date":"2015-09-30T23:26:24.955+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"32 death in 37 minutes, guess teleport does help with the feed.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Autismo Extremo","date":"2015-09-24T11:43:12.525+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=akaRaven,realm=OCE,application-id=hIjvqaz6,discussion-id=LAjbJ3hr,comment-id=0000,timestamp=2015-09-24T03:46:09.167+0000)\n> I can guarantee you this, SOMEONE here will come along and say the following usual shit:\n> 1.

This would add another factor to the  ranking system and i'm not sure Riot wants to alter it. I'm not sure Riot even understands the ranking system, it's not practical to me. If the LP gain/loss was determined by your performance in the game, that would lessen the blow when you lose because of feeders. And be proper recognition of your input if you won.","replies":[{"poster":"Bcann2","date":"2015-09-25T00:25:33.881+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yeh, all of that is true. I understand that people would try and scam it by, for example, if they mess up early game, they will just intentionally troll. But even so, I lost more LP that game than i won back in the next game. It seems to me that (no offense) they really only care about the higher level players of the game as they bring in more players and overall more money. Again no offense but it would be really appreciated by all of us I think if we got showed a little more attention.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Bcann2","date":"2015-09-24T09:14:37.894+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thanks for the moral support.
