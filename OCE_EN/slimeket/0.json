Hence \"Forced Synergy\". This is not a perfect fit as I'm also including weaknesses and other elements that seem forced, like the Kha'zix and Rengar's level 16 quest. Which is not an example of synergy, rather a weakness or strength between a match up between champions on opposing teams.\r\n\r\nAnyway, I feel pre-season 5 has started implementing forced synergy to plenty of aspects of the game. The bottom line, I think Riot staff should consider \"Forced Synergy\" when making design changes to the game for the following reasons:\r\n\r\n1. It's a cop out way of changing the game.\r\nExamples: Don't want Alistar jungle? Make him do less damage to monsters. 2v1 lanes too annoying? make top towers stronger then other towers during early game.\r\nThis stuff seriously annoys me about as much as if Riot were to give Lucian +50 attack damage when near an enemy Thresh if there was a problem with Lucian vs Thresh line ups (not that there is a problem).\r\n\r\n2. Champion Synergy\r\nThere is a difference between natural and forced synergy between champions, lets consider the difference between the following combos: Malphite/Orianna and Malphite/Yasuo, in both situations Malphite's Unstoppable Force provides a really good initiation that can catch out multiple players even when they are only briefly out of position. And the follow up from Orianna and Yasuo deals insane AOE damage with additional crowed control. However Malphites Unstoppable Force only ASSISTS Orianna's Command: Shockwave, where as it ALLOWS Yasuo's Last Breath.\r\n\r\n3. Champion Position\r\nExample: Shyvana's Burnout (W): Deals 20% more damage to monsters (as of patch 4.21).\r\nA champion's position on the map should be decided by what there kit would be useful at doing not based on the bonuses they may get from playing specific positions.\r\n\r\nI don't mind it this kind of thing sometimes. Sometimes it could be even be necessary to create the great champions you want to create. But during this pre-season I think it has went overboard. Ultimately, League of Legends is one of the best game's I've played, and it still is amazing. But I chose to play league because it was the one MOBA that wasn't trying its hardest to be exactly like DOTA Allstars on Warcraft III. And I'm bringing this up because DOTA features primary attributes: Strength, Agility and Intelligence which are examples of forced synergy. To be honest I really enjoyed that riot was able to see that the interaction of specific stats with specific champions was silly, have you forgotten that?","replies":[{"poster":"DianasGotSwag","date":"2014-12-15T11:44:33.209+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Ali jungle was insane at one point ages ago. Never really seen it work since that was way before I started League as far as I know but the reason they want Ali out of the jungle is because he can Malph ult gank at level three. Sort of. And that is hard to balance to be good jungle material without making him OP in lane.","replies":[{"poster":"Slimeket","date":"2014-12-18T09:17:18.972+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It's not riot trying to take Alistar out of the jungle that I don't like, its the way they do it.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"BfM DevOuR","date":"2014-12-13T03:57:05.340+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"tldr QQ","replies":[]},{"poster":"Akuen","date":"2014-12-12T22:12:17.725+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I understand that feeling. \"We don't want Alistar Jungle to be a thing, so we're nerfing him.
