Freeze your lane, work with your jungler to stop him farming effectively. Any team/jungler worth their salt will know that Nasus needs to be stopped from just camping top all day. It helps if your other lanes are doing well, so he is forced to come down from top and pop that teleport to help out, thus disrupting his farm. When you're not getting a gank, just harass him from afar to make him miss the odd cs and annoy him.","replies":[]},{"poster":"dragon poo","date":"2015-09-26T18:08:09.385+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Armour helps, as does the ability to kite and such, Botrk works wonders against him, and if you cant stunt his ealry game stacking its harder for him to be better in the late game, have your jungler camp your lane if he is the only late game threat and hope for the best.","replies":[]},{"poster":"SeemsFishyy","date":"2015-09-26T04:27:33.682+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"If anyone of u guys would like to add me, I play OCE name is: SeemsFishyy, I'm a silver 4 jungle/top\nBecause I really do need help against some really strong champs in the meta because I have only been playing league for six months.","replies":[]},{"poster":"noogai","date":"2015-09-26T03:11:47.221+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Learn how to play Fiora. She shuts down nasus hard. Fight him by poking his vitals with Q and using E afterwards to apply more damage than he can lifesteal out of, and then when you go all-in, wait for him to ult and then hit him with your ult. Use your W to parry his Q's if you're dueling him and you should be able to laugh your way to the nexus.","replies":[]},{"poster":"ninjaIRL ","date":"2015-09-26T03:03:11.950+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"If you're a range you can try to kite him. \nVayne, Quinn do relatively well.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Garens Harem","date":"2015-09-26T01:25:16.696+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"play shit like {{champion:122}} , basically champions who do really well early game\n\nnotes in general to counter doge in LANE\n\n- do not push the lane, try to have it in the middle or near your tower. Pushing makes it easier for nasus to farm under tower\n- play aggressive, but not too aggressive, watch minion agro\n- if you're playing ranged, abuse your autos\n- don't be passive\n\n\nceebs doing teamfight+ late game\n\nyou can add me and i can teach you in a 1v1 match ( i play nasus and then you play nasus to get a viewpoint on both sides) ","replies":[]},{"poster":"DragonOfTheVoid","date":"2015-09-26T09:34:26.220+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"1: if he q's you he cant get stacks don't be afraid to take damage from him if you are a tank \n2: if you are a ranged champ top {{champion:17}} {{champion:30}} {{champion:429}} {{champion:85}} {{champion:96}} {{champion:68}} {{champion:13}} so on taking a adc top is not a dog move its smart but back to 2 if you are ranged the hit him hard make it so if he is in lane he is below 20% hp all the time \n3: ask the jg to camp top let the wave push to your tower and freeze it if he goes to get cs then you and the jg take him out \n4: its not hard \n5: get good \n6: stop bitching this is ezy to figer out on your own if you are older then 12 or have a basic knowledge of the game \n7: if you cant kill a tank in this meta you are so bad what counters a tank {{item:3035}} {{item:3153}} nar that wont work only every adc and jg takes Bork and only every adc takes last whisper well they should be","replies":[]}]}
