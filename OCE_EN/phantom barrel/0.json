I have had many games where I have personally earned an S grade or above, and my profile indicated that I have four chests available to earn.  Please get back to me on this issue!\r\n\r\nCheers\r\n\r\nCampbell AKA Phantom Barrel","replies":[{"poster":"SephirothSG","date":"2016-08-10T10:13:38.312+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey there,\n\nHave you already earned a chest with that champion? I believe you're only able to earn one chest per champ until the end of the season.\n\n>You can earn up to four chests each month, and each champion you play can earn you one chest per season. You’ll see which champs you’re eligible for in champ select and on your champ details page.","replies":[{"poster":"Phantom Barrel","date":"2016-08-10T11:10:54.716+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Oooh thank you very much for that information.
