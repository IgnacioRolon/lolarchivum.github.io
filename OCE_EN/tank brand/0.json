My other 30 account for some reason is fine and has **no problems**.\r\n\r\nAny solution would be appreciated\r\n\r\nThanks","replies":[{"poster":"Wuks","date":"2015-11-22T03:46:44.923+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey bCo,\n\nCould you try the following?\n\nClose League.\nGo to C:\\Riot Games\\league of Legends\\RADS\\projects\nDelete the Delete the lol_air_config_na folder\nRestart the client to redownload it.\nLog into NA\nGo to C:\\Riot Games\\league of Legends\\config\nDelete PersistedSettings.json, game.cfg and input.ini\nCreate a custom game to test it.","replies":[]}]}
