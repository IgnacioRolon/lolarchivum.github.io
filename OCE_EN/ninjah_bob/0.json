I hope one of the Riot team members read this.\r\n\r\nI just saw a little green thing on my account I've never seen before, hovered my mouse over it and it said I have a 4 win IP boost. This is concerning to me as I haven't bought one, and also because it used to have a thing about registering your email address to get a 4 win IP boost, and I'm wondering if someone has gained access to my account and done that. I am a bit worried by this, and would like to know how I can register my email address if someone else hasn't already done it. \r\n\r\nI really hope I've made a mistake here.","replies":[{"poster":"Homura Akemi","date":"2014-11-21T15:09:58.188+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"its a reward for good player behaviour so enjoy it lad","replies":[{"poster":"Ninjah Bob","date":"2014-11-21T15:37:06.284+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I highly doubt that, i'm pretty toxic and abusive in alot of games","replies":[{"poster":"DatEpicPotato","date":"2014-11-21T22:48:47.623+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> I highly doubt that, i'm pretty toxic and abusive in alot of games\n\nAs long as you haven't been banned for it you will get it","replies":[]},{"poster":"SkarSkarSkarner","date":"2014-11-21T16:04:53.281+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Well it most likely is.
