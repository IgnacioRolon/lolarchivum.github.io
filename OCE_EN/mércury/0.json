I came up with this one a few weeks ago and I think it could go a long way (My other ones were kinda bad) so here is what I have so far.\r\n\r\nKit and Lore ideas:\r\n* A female Shuriman\r\n* Xerath&#039;s sister, but killed by him when he betrayed Azir\r\n* Brought back to life in the present as a being of balance and order (even if that means helping evil)\r\n* Ultimate is learnt at level 1 and changes her abilities depending on the form.\r\n* In the starting form (light form), her kit empowers and supports allies; while in the other (dark form), her abilities disadvantage or damage enemies.\r\n* Maybe for one of her dark form abilities, she has a skillshot discord orb that stops at the first enemy hit, and lowers their armour and magic resist for a few seconds.\r\nLore (tell me if it is bad please)\r\n\r\nShemti was a peaceful slave from Shurima. She never knew her family, except for her brother, Xerath. They were inseparable. Their jobs as slaves was to help build the temples and buildings in the capital of Shurima. When her brother started befriending the emperor, Azir and started learning about the Sun Disk and magic, Shemti felt as though the kind brother she had known was fading away. He would go into a fit of anger when something as minor as food was dropped. He would have an evil look in his eyes from time to time, and a lust for power and glory. One night, after Xerath had fallen asleep, Shemti looked through his books and noticed that Xerath was reading about how to steal the power of the Ascension. She then knew in her heart that her brother was gone and that his craving for glory and wealth was corrupting him. A few months passed, and they were invited by Azir to attend his Ascension. Xerath immediately accepted the invitation and strolled to his quarters.\r\nThe day of the Ascension finally came, and Azir was too overwhelmed with the fantasy of the power he would gain, just like Xerath. Shemti confronted Xerath as he was running towards the Sun Disc. She tried her best to convince Xerath to not interfere with the process. Xerath said it was his destiny to claim this power and quickly tossed his sister aside. He ran towards Azir and shoved him out of the way as the Ascension began. Then, everything was destroyed and Xerath became a being of power. \r\nSometime later in the outskirts of the recently destroyed (city in the bloodlines lore), Shemti reappeared as a being of order with her mission to destroy her brother and end his chaotic power once and for all. She flew up into the air and soared over to the capital to speak to the emperor she once knew.\r\n\r\nThanks for reading!","replies":[]}
