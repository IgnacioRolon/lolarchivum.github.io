When we got in game he started flaming everyone and insulting me. The enemy xin backed me up saying how he did the same thing last champ select. ez threatened me to get banned i doubt i would have gotten punished because the enemy team disagreed with his saying and actions. But after my next game of playing league i got chat restricted. why am i getting punished and the real troll getting away with all of this?","replies":[{"poster":"HaveYouSeenMyCat","date":"2017-05-11T09:37:31.714+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"it tells you when some one was punished as a result of your report","replies":[]},{"poster":"Talon12","date":"2017-05-09T10:46:32.710+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"because you were swearing over and over and over because of him","replies":[{"poster":"Crazy Wolf","date":"2017-05-09T11:27:02.876+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"and where did you get your sources?","replies":[{"poster":"Klavinmour","date":"2017-05-09T11:32:44.262+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"You wouldn't have gotten a ban without having said abusive things.\n\nJust because someone else is being a %%%%, don't give you the right to do the same.","replies":[{"poster":"Crazy Wolf","date":"2017-05-09T11:41:05.845+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"i will admit that i said thing that isn't right but there is still injustice he should be getting the same treatment as i would be having and i will say he was being way more toxic than anyone in the whole game","replies":[{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2017-05-09T13:19:01.433+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"How do you know he didn't get a chat restriction?
