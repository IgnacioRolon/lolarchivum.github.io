I don't recall being abusive or singling a person out but I was banned for my apparent negative attitude towards the same kind of people you played with.\n\nRiot are apparently working on things, but it's been this way for as long as I can remember and nothing has changed. The longer they keep their heads in the sand and believe their automated system is working the worse off it will get.\n\nIt sucks but unfortunately that's the best advice I can give. If you don't like reading it or have a thick enough skin to brush it off the only other option is to mute people and report after the game. If it's any consolation I'm sure if those people who were toxic have a nice chat restriction or possible perma ban coming their way shortly.","replies":[]},{"poster":"JesusForgotHisGA","date":"2017-01-25T00:39:22.091+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I doubt you're going to get any reaction from Riot, maybe the standard copy pasta response.\n\nI know exactly what you're saying and the game is riddled with it. There's little to nothing you can do but use the shitty automated system at the end of the game and hope to god that they get banned. Realistically tho unless it's a common thing and they continually do it I very much doubt they will be perma banned.\n\nBest thing you can do in these situations is mute everyone and play your own game. Accept that you are going to lose and try keep your cool. Because if you flame in return chances are you will be getting a few reports from the other flamers and they will only be getting one from you.\n\nIt's just part of the shit mentality and attitude that makes up the OCE server. Everyone wants to jump on the bandwagon and play the blame game when things don't work out.","replies":[{"poster":"HumanbeastOM","date":"2017-01-25T00:49:17.091+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"i really appreciate your response..if riot had been watching my past games/chat logs ive been making a positive impact.1/10 games become trash and we get punished for it....thing is bro..i dont want to mute everyone/anyone for that matter..if it comes to a toxic team and people i would distance myself..however with the case last night i was being told to kill myself and more degenerate crap was aimed at me,i was cut up and reacted.. i personally have had an occasion when i was in the game lobby one time..i was trying to talk to my team..not one person responded..then i get into the game..apparently i was \"spamming\" and one of the players decided to project his afk and bad playing upon me..they threw the game because i was trying to talk to them nicely/work with my team..i assume people join groups in discord and flame the other players they get matched with..not all but allot of people do it..so..even when im trying to make a positive impact..it gets taken the wrong way..and i get punished for it..last night i was pretty rude.but i wasnt the worst one there..i understand a punishment for my language,im not saying i dont deserve a ban what im pissed off with was how they decided to....I know players like me and you care about this game,but im certain that if riot doesnt fix this..allot of innocent people are going to be leaving the game/via banned or simply walking away from the toxic crowd.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"HumanbeastOM","date":"2017-01-25T00:33:08.941+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Comon riot lets discuss this.","replies":[]}]}
