A 2 level lead, no enemy summs, 1.5 waves of minions, or I could leave you there, lets you try your best to get the best of 2 waves under pressure, and risk letting them dive you or simply just zone you out of the crashing cs and completely wreck your tower.\n\nThe issue is people have the mentality that ganking is for killing, but forcing a back, burning summoners, zoning are all very important too. If your jungler is doing a gank like that, odds are it isn't a 'kill gank', but more to try to alleviate pressure, even out the hp/mana levels on the lane and let you setup a freeze, and then he plans on recalling and buying. Those types of gank should be responded to with zone pressure, you need to move up, maybe throw a few spells in until the enemy laner disengages, don't chase, once the enemy laner has gotten some distance, return to your minions, you'll miss a few yes, but unless you're high elo, you're going to lose minions to the crashing tower if your opponent is pressuring you anyway, and you may even die for it, or take a chunk of damage onto your tower. If you're under tower with half hp, enemy is crashing a wave to tower, and your jungler comes in, he's not trying to kill the laner, he's likely aiming to alleviate pressure, or at least trade some of his hp into your laners before he recalls.","replies":[{"poster":"Nightjar","date":"2018-01-30T04:16:50.431+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"I hate people who ragequit when you 'ks' during a gank.

Assist gold isn't pittance anymore, and hasn't been for ages. Better to get a kill on the jungler and assist on top than no kill at all.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"00shots00","date":"2018-01-30T05:20:22.033+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"and this is the thing that people don't understand. a top laner with a huge lead 80% of the time can determine a victory. shutting down any top laner is by far the best thing you can do because with the adc meta everyone is all about waiting for scale. the 2 solo lanes needs more pressure and help with jglers. ive had this one to me time and time again and the only way I win after that is muting everyone and continuing to feed them until they leave me alone and I out farm their lead. jglers in all elos are so selfish with what they are able to do and then to come up with shit excuses to not help you. the bot lane shouldn't need help or struggle anyway like there is 2 people with 4 sums no one should be dying. help the solo lanes don't be a jerk","replies":[{"poster":"SOOM","date":"2018-01-30T08:18:48.277+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"The thing is... with top lane rn you can go 0/10 and you can win lane just by bot and mid winning ... top has very little impact in this meta which is pretty bad hoping it changes.... take FOX vs TSM game a couple days ago ... huni was 0/3 on gp top vs 3/0 Vlad hauntzer... but Vlad had no impact later in the game resulting in FOX adc stomping.","replies":[{"poster":"00shots00","date":"2018-01-30T20:42:24.901+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"i'd have to say I really disagree with you there. if you get the solo lanes ahead their damage and game impact is so much more reliable than hoping your bot lane. and I'm talking about solo Q not comp or Esports. another thing people don't understand, its god dam solo Q not freaking Esports, the amount of mid laners that go down bot with no TP now is stupid.","replies":[]},{"poster":"JasonWazza","date":"2018-01-30T08:23:35.586+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It'll be worse post 8.2\n\nIf you can put a bot lane behind, support will have no sightstone, so bot lane will likely be perma camped.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}
