The fact that he's unstoppable makes it hard to lock him down when he screws up and difficult to peel against. He was too hard to punish compared to other tanks, whilst also being easier to play than other tanks that had to play larger risk reward games for lane pressure like gnar, urgot and nasus.\n\nAlso vayne is still the best adc.\n\nAlso teemo is dominant, but he's not OP. He's easy to counterpick, but as a counterpick he's admittedly frustrating. Laning phase becomes either get jungler to camp, which has trade offs and becomes a question of whether you can get fed enough to mitigate the damage botlane will be taking from reduced defensive jungle pressure, or not get a camp, and sit under tower like a little b*tch until you can get an adaptive helm. His power curve is a little bit messed up right now, not overpowered as a whole, but certainly too uneven and polarising at it's high points.","replies":[{"poster":"Fitzky","date":"2018-01-25T03:34:09.564+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Regarding Orrn, the change they made was really stupid, the unstoppable part of Ornn's W was what made it a special and unique ability and it was not the issue.
