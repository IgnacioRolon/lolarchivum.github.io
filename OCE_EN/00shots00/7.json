We have a zac jg, i ask zac can he gank like maybe twice get me a little ahead ill build my tanky items first then he can leave my lane alone, in which he replies narh man im playing around our botlane sorry. the game goes on and they start blaming me, like its my fault they want to help each other but not me, so i was over trying little replies and being put down for not actually have team mates, more like 4 people that hate you more than your enemies and i stop to reply to everything. legit. stop. wherever i am. im told to shut up and so on and im trash and useless and a bunch of other names. the worst part about all of this is when my adc, the quitest one on our team says sorry yi i know theyre being toxic but i reporting you to for not muting them. like what is wrong with you people? youre going to report me for defending myself in a nice manner compeared to what i used to reply with but you guys re that scared and have no balls to stick up for whats right? im getting over this shit man honestly.","replies":[{"poster":"QAPLA","date":"2018-01-31T00:20:54.071+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"If you behaved, their reports do nothing.","replies":[{"poster":"00shots00","date":"2018-01-31T00:56:03.532+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"so literally stopping to explain how being toxic doesn't help any matter and cements our defeat shouldn't be a bannable offense?","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"QAPLA","date":"2018-01-31T00:58:49.637+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Exactly.

I saw somewhere someone got banned for grieving because he consistently stopped to reply, but then again the most famous one is when someone said they are being harassed in the game and they were finding it to play that game and they are just trying to figure out what that players problem was, and the other player actually got banned XD{{sticker:slayer-pantheon-rainbows}}","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Sn4ke","date":"2018-02-04T10:25:23.753+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You were defending yourself so I'd say you wouldn't get banned. Riot is very crucial about racist or homophobic comments towards other players so as long as you've done nothing like that you'll be fine bruh.","replies":[]}]}
