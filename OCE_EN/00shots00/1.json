Majority of players I see are either perfectly lovely or don't say much at all, but different ranks seem to encourage different outlets for those prone to toxicity. Every elo has it's issues, and every elo is prone to some of the same kind of toxicity (It's like some people don't understand that you can't win every game, and if you're where you belong you're only going to be winning about half).\n\nI don't think there's really any argument that any elo is better or worse, they're just all somewhat different. Plateauing in x elo just means you see more of the behaviour specific to that elo so it stands out more.","replies":[{"poster":"00shots00","date":"2018-03-12T01:31:02.233+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"yeah I understand you but the most annoying thing in the world is knowing and reading ï don't care I'm already getting the skin. \n\nlike dude come on just try and you can get more than the skin. you can get elo for gods sake","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"BarryButcher","date":"2018-03-11T04:53:07.977+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"you've obviously never been Plat then...\n\nPlat is by far the worst and Silver is a close 2nd.
