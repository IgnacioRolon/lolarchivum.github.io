Also burst runes got gutted last patch which is alot of Renektons power, so this was a bit of compensation to that.\n\nRenekton is one of those champions that seems better than he is, largely because the playerbase is experienced, and when he does get out of hand it's very very noticable.\n\nAlso if your toplane is still building damage or core items after renekton gets a few kills lead, your game is done because your toplaner is an idiot and doesn't understand Renekton's powercurve.","replies":[{"poster":"00shots00","date":"2018-09-18T03:39:49.100+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"i dont know what rank you are but im in gold which is bassically the new bronze. aint no one building smart in this league.\n\n\nhe may be a weak lane bully but according to what champion? the only ones that out him are non mana sustain champs","replies":[{"poster":"Nightjar","date":"2018-09-19T00:52:55.301+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"well Poppy comes to mind, she is a good counter in lane with her q trading evenly with renekton's w, and her w blocking any attempt renekton takes to engage. Somewhere between a bruiser and a tank, as a tank Poppy can afford to build armour and shut renekton out without messing up her build path, and as a bruiser she doesn't lack the damage to punish him if he tries to bully her. Statistically she is the hardest counter to renekton atm, with the highest rate of killing him in early lane, the better winrate, higher damage dealt, and is likely to zone renekton out of cs starting at lvl2 and continuing for the duration of the laning phase.\n\nother than that, typically 'hard' lane bullies come to mind, such as Sion, Quinn, Teemo, Garen(I hate this champion so much) and ofc king of earlygame lane bullies Pantheon. These champions all tend to out bully Renekton with their more dominant laning patterns, and a few of them outscale him as well.\n\nI'm a gold fill main, because between my two accounts I play pretty much every role. Also ignore the crit rammus and ad shen in my match history, I was tilted, having dinner and trying to play with one hand. As expected it did not go well.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Slam H2017","date":"2018-09-17T23:09:19.931+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"A few months ago I played against a really good Renekton, I think he got like 2 pentakills and a quadrakill that game without any help from his team XD","replies":[]},{"poster":"BarryButcher","date":"2018-09-14T01:56:16.256+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"He has a 51% winrate and these buffs did next to nothing since no Renekton player uses their Fury on the E.\n\nEveryone knows dont fight Renekton between level 3-6.
