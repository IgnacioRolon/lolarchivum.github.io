I know several people who've been trolled a lot more than I have and even they haven't gone down that path.\n\nIf you want a voice, you need to understand you *already* have one, but the thing is no one is going to listen if you're acting like a spoilt brat throwing a tantrum. Get out there and make your voice heard on the boards and reddit and even things like \"Change.org\", instead of just sitting in your own little corner sooking about how things are bad and they wont change.","replies":[{"poster":"00shots00","date":"2018-05-09T21:25:40.173+0000","up_votes":0,"down_votes":1,"body":"[REMOVED]","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"TheDemonEmperor","date":"2018-05-09T04:44:38.140+0000","up_votes":0,"down_votes":0,"body":"I have relationships to maintain, bills to pay, pressing matters to tend to.

In any case, trolling is a good cure. I broke the 15 loss streak with Miss Fortune Support, lmao. Of course in the next few days I climbed back up 3 divisions to where I normally am. So when teams start playing like fools, or emotional kids exist in your champ select, it's time to troll.

And that's why he quit.\n\nHere's some good trolling picks:\n\n1) Jinx mid with grasp of the undying\n2) Anything support with smite\n3) Twitch support\n\nOf course you have to consider the opposition team before you pick these, but if conditions are right then its a great time to troll.
