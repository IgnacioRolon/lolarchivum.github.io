If gold players are getting sent back to silver then actual silver/bronze players should not be in our games. and to put 3-4 actual silver players in a team is unfair and I felt sorry for 2 people in one of my games because I solo carried the game with full tank ornn top. \r\n\r\nI just want to know if riot thinks their system works or if its a thing they&#039;re looking to try and sort out this year. \r\n\r\nI plan on getting to diamond this year, but I was having better luck winning last year than I was this year and I feel that I&#039;m ALWAYS with &quot;bots&quot; and I know this gets said a lot and my final scores at the end of the game don&#039;t help me, but i&#039;d rather have a crack instead of sitting back and leaving my score to look good so I can bitch about others. or maybe I should&#039;ve listened to my mate (InMySight) he&#039;s a challenger player and always tries to tell me to wait a month play on one of your smurfs...","replies":[]}
