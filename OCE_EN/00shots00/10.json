I&#039;m a top lane main that has mainly played Kled but do go moaki if i feel its needed. I feel i find more easier and quicker success if i have an aggressive ballsy team that isn&#039;t afraid to go follow up on my ults and dives. \r\n\r\nlately its a 50 50 to where i find that players seem to care more about their KDA than actually winning the game. to where they play passive and will lose all out turrets just catch 1 guy out of position with us losing no one for it, but still not wanting to 5 v 5 after it. players that will be next to me when i ult in for the 5 v 4 while we have a lead but walk off saying why are you trying that just wait.\r\n\r\ni would like this discussion to be an open minded non toxic discussion and would like everyone to post their views so i can adapt quickly and find a way to still win even without having any outer turrets.","replies":[{"poster":"Lord Sesshomaru","date":"2018-05-01T01:44:36.343+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Both Kled and Maokai are very balls-to-the-wall champions. And so while it might suit you and your playstyle for your team to always follow you in, it may not always be the best plan for the team itself.\n\nChampions like say, Kha'Zix are built for making picks and taking out the backline and escaping before anyone knows they're there. So is he going to want to charge balls deep into a team fight where everyone knows he's coming? Probably not, because he knows that doing that removes a lot of power from his own kit.\n\nReading your own team is just as important as reading the enemy's.\n\nIn so many games I have people in my team shouting \"we need to group.\" \"We have to teamfight.\" \"Why aren't you grouping f*cking idiots.\"\nAnd I look at the enemy team and they have:\n\nIllaoi\nSejuani\nBrand\nXayah\nRakan\n\nAnd we have something like:\n\nYorick\nUdyr\nKassadin\nQuinn\nMorgana \n\nIn that situation, grouping and team fighting would be the worst thing to do, and the people asking for it are doing it out of habit, not from looking at the teams and assessing the strengths of each team.\n\nEven in a 4v5, the enemy team is still likely to win that fight.\n\nYou might find it's the same with Kled, you might be picking a balls-to-the-Wall champion into an allied team where that playstyle is actually disadvantageous. And your team sees this and doesn't want to go in, but because you play mainly Kled, it's the only playstyle you know and are confident with. Which is why you feel it's always the right course of action.\n\nMy advice would be to study your own team in champ select before picking your champs. If you have lots of assassins and split pushers, you might want to pick someone who can help them with that, rather than picking a champ that relies on 5v5 teamfights. The reverse is also true, if your team is picking teamfight heavy champs, maybe don't pick a champ that sits and relentlessly pushes top lane for 40 minutes.\n\nIt seems you've got team fighting champs under wraps, so I would suggest investing some time into other champs that revolve around a different playstyle, like Camille who can make picks easily, or Gangplank who can push lanes into oblivion.\nSo you can adapt your picks for what is required by the team.\n\n-------------------------------\n\nIm a mid laner, but Yorick is my go to top laner, and when I play him, If I'm with the team, I'm doing it wrong! I trust my team to push and make picks while I carve my way through towers in outer lanes.\nBut I also have Aatrox who I'm equally confident with, for when the team needs someone to leap headlong into the fray and wreak havoc, or to duel a problem champ and keep him away from the carries long enough for my team to set up their wombos.\n\nBut all this has to be predicted and done in champ select, that's the hard part.\nEven when I'm in mid (territory I'm more familiar with) sometimes I won't pick Aurelion Sol because I'm so worried about lane counters, and I miss the fact that a roaming Mage with AoE CC is exactly what our botlane needs to get our Vayne fed.\nAnd it's much better to have an under-fed Sol and a fed Vayne, than an under-fed Vayne and a mid laner that goes even with the enemy mid.\n\nSo it's just a matter of trying to see the patterns between champions and picking accordingly.\n\nThis is my thought on the situation anyway.\n\nHope it helps","replies":[{"poster":"00shots00","date":"2018-05-01T02:21:48.215+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I do understand the fact that you cant treat every game the same and i've learnt that the hard way XD \n\nand before i go on, im with you completely and im not being a dick, and thank you for commenting :)\n\n\nI feel that ive finally noticed why top laners complain a whole lot in lower elo's and its simply because (in my opinion) its very jgler based. Its kinda sad and makes me feel shit to say that huni was right last year. \n\ni know camille and every combo she has and even made videos while playing her. i used to main trynd, camille, yorick and kled all together depending on what i felt like the team needed. \n\nbut everytime id pick camille trynd and yorick id feel the early game sucking because even when im pushed in and getting poked down my jgler would feel that im the losing lane so why help the losing lane? \n\nthe play style that ive picked up goes like this as kled,\n\nwin or losing laning phase\n\n- trade with other guy as much as i can (damage testing) \n- kill or be killed until lvl 6\n- *hits lvl 6* *backs buys what ever i can* ult down bot to give bot lane a lead \n- mid game- \n- focus all outer turrets and convince team to help\n- me personally focus out of place champs \n- late game- -end of game- \n- split push \n- watching map more than actually trying to cs tbh\n- watch where back line is positioned and when the fight breaks out ult from the back line\n\n-if being held at our tower-\n- watch for cc cooldowns (important one)\n- once they have been used ult in and go crazy\n\nthis has worked 60% of my games but the ones where it doesn't i find my team sort of backs off and hesitates and they just sit there and watch me. \n\na lot of the time being kled i know i have chances at surviving an in and out so ill jump in make them waste like a leona ult and ill back off reset and wait for minor cc to be used then ult in. \n\ni dont know its just most the time i feel like ive got to be the one giving a speech to my team mates trying to boost their confidence with the champs they're using XD","replies":[{"poster":"Lord Sesshomaru","date":"2018-05-01T14:31:04.539+0000","up_votes":0,"down_votes":0,"body":"I admire your well thought out process!\nBut that too could catalyse the issue. It can be difficult to adapt to the almost innumerable number of variables the game offers, if you're always keeping to the same plan, especially one so specific.\n\nIn regards to you feeling like the losing lane when playing other champs.\nI don't think it really matters. If you pick champs like Yorick or Tryndamere, it isn't the lane phase you should be concerned with anyway.\nTrynd is a mid-late game hyper carry, he's not supposed to be huge force in lane. Just focus on keeping up in farm and not dying, and eventually you'll become the un-killable 1-hit monster he was born to be. Its just a ticking clock, you don't have to do well, you just have to not feed.\n\nSimilar with Yorick, you don't have to be constantly trading or racking up kills, just keep the pressure on, keep the enemy jungle's attention away from other lanes. Spend the laning phase farming and slowly whittling down their tower. You don't have to come out as 5/1 or anything, and once the enemy leaves you alone in top once the lane has ended, your true job begins. \n\n___________\n\nMore often than not, ill lose mid lane tower in my games, not because they've beaten me in lane, but because I've taken first tower in bot 5 minutes ago, and have kept the pressure up in side lanes ever since.\nWith champs like Sol or Taliyah, I pretty much abandon mid lane post-6 whenever possible, and become a second jungler, I often sacrifice my own lane and farm to ensure the other lanes succeed, _(a fed Vayne and Darius is worth a heck of a lot more than a well-farmed Sol)_.\n\nEven when playing champs who are oppressive in lane, like Swain, and when I get ahead with them, I often dont stay and win lane, I have 2 options:\n\n1. Stay in lane and keep them down, and get even stronger myself.\n2. Leave lane and spread my lead to other lanes.\n\nMore often than not, I go for option 2.\nYes we could have a fed Swain and vs an underfed Lux. But it is way better to have the whole team slightly elevated, than have 1 player quite far ahead. One player can be focused down, or make mistakes. A whole team is less likely to throw.\n\n\nSo winning lane isn't the be-all and end-all.\n\n____________\n\nIn regards to the jungler ganking _(or not ganking)_ you.\n\nYou're a confident player, you know your own skill, you know you're not going to feed your ass off even when behind. So do you need the jungler? Isn't it better to have the jungler babysitting other lanes, players who might be less confident, and who now have a lead they wouldn't have had.\n\nThink of it like treating everyone as an idiot.\nEven if you're fed, you cant carry a feeding idiot.\nBut if the idiot is fed, you don't have to carry them, because even if they do make a mistake, they're fed, they have a safety blanket.\n\nRather than gilding your own sturdy armour with gold and gems, work on fixing the weak rusted armour of the guy who's protecting your back.\n\nSo I would much rather the jungler camp other lanes, because I know even if I'm behind, I'm not going to screw mine up too badly. But I'm not sure they they wont screw theirs up. So id rather they had the help instead of me, just incase.\n\nBut often your team mates aren't idiots and with a little extra help they become a force to be reckoned with, and you can piggyback on their success.","replies":[{"poster":"00shots00","date":"2018-05-01T23:07:50.554+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yeah i put your wording to the test last night. \n\nfirst game told the jgler get the other lanes ahead and i wont be in lane after 6.

A good question that Riot should be asking themselves before they release new patches. Let's try some of the answers:\n\n**Bronze-Gold**: The game is won by the team that does the penultimate throw. Or by the team that completely stomps some emotional kids.\n**Platinum**: The game is won by the team that does the penultimate baron throw.\n**Diamond 5-3**: The game is won either by the wintraders, or whoever does not disconnect, or troll. Failing those conditions, the game is actually a normal game, sometimes with smurfs in it. \n**Diamond 2+**: The game is won by the team with the most warding and macro sense. And sometimes a wintrader, like the chinese guy in the top 10 currently.\n\nOk, that was rather generalistic, but you get the drift... the game is not won by a solocarry, unless its in low elo and its a split pushing tryndamere or something where macro doesn't exist. \n\n**In low elo**, players run around like chickens for kills, rather than keeping their eyes on the objectives and how to get them. Junglers farm in the bot lane when baron is up. Top laners don't take teleport and still lose lane. The opposing top laner with teleport does not know where to be or how to pressure the map. ADCs are all monkeys that don't know the difference between a trade or an all in. Can't position in teamfights. Split push when assasins are on the map and not visible. Better bot lane generally wins in low elo. Teamfights are taken without major cooldowns up. Some teamfights are not even taken, because players don't understand damage, or even what champions do in fights. Mid laners don't know how to flank in vision, during teamfights. Supports like Brand and Lux try to solocarry, when that is not possible. Sometimes Brand gets lucky with an ultimate. Mid lane Lux's are the worst. They don't realise how important it is to keep their mid lane tower, so they practically lose lane by what they do in the first two waves vs assasins. Old Leblanc is back and stomping fools.\n\nJust a quick summary.","replies":[{"poster":"Bookbash","date":"2018-05-28T02:44:15.629+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Bookbash,realm=OCE,application-id=FjGAIbRv,discussion-id=JbYjs2XX,comment-id=0005,timestamp=2018-05-08T04:24:03.332+0000)\n>\n> And sometimes a wintrader, like the chinese guy in the top 10 currently.\n\nOh look, someone has tried to notify them about this: **Chinese Wintraders reach RANK 1 on OCE**\n\nI'd like to see a Riot comment on this.

I just posted a youtube video link thats all. No names were posted on this board!\n\nThese people in the video have been reported btw. But the player is still at #2 on the ranked list.\n\nLet me tell you, that I have a lot of experience in another field where players online try to cheat. And they get away with it because the field in which they are cheating in requires a skill level that players in lower divisions or elo would not recognise. A lot of people in these divisions would watch the video and then say \"wow, he's just accusing people willy nilly\" without actually doing a proper investigation. This is why the site in charge of the game needs to do one, now. If it means they need to hire higher level players to understand the claims, then be it.\nWhen you have these sort of players cheating, it not only brings down the level of skill of the entire region (looking at you Dire Wolves) because they cannot have proper practice, but it warps the entire ranking system in total.\n\nI'll give you an example. On the world's biggest chess site back in 2009-2011, the ratings were being overly inflated. This occured because multiple number of smurf accounts were feeding main accounts. The cheating was sophisticated enough because staff did not detect it. However of course players at a higher skill level could see the cheating blatantly. Because of this cheating and the fact that players respect higher ranking players, certain world class players were seen in the public's eyes to be 'weak'. This not only was totally incorrect but it affected their incomes, their respect and their overall perception of the site. Many of those players quit. It was not until they had a case of multiple titled players using the same blatant cheating methods (in order to protect their well-being they resorted to this), that the site finally decided to hire 1 person (that's right 1 person) to police the matter in ranked games. Now this site also had an automated system to detect cheating, but it wasn't working because the methods these players used was far too clever for it to recognise cheating.\n\nAfter this one person was hired, the cheating problem started to die down, and the site returned to some sort of normality around 2013. That's four years of messed up ranks, players being falsely judged in the publics eyes, lost income from professionals, and more general cheating and also more general 'sitting' on ranks to avoid cheaters. A totally messed up situation.\n\nIf Riot Games Oceania is serious about this site, they need to do something now, before those situations happen to them also. You may think this is a dramatisation, but I can assure you that there is more than one example of a similar site that I can give, where that site has become a ghost town and players quit that site.\n\nLower elo players will probably be oblivious to all of this (it is happening in Diamond 5+ games), but if you want to bring back skill to this game and not make it totally randomised depending on who is wintrading, then you need to do something now.","replies":[{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2018-05-31T07:47:03.061+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The video you linked was naming names.

Consistent small cheeses can really help get past small roadblocks at certain elos.\n\nAlso Kled's best runes are Conqueror into Resolve's bone plating (survive trades) and chrysalis (extra hp is good for fighting early, and extra ad is better for fighting mid-late, generally good stat value rune for fighters) for tough matchups, or Conqueror into Domination's sudden impact (burst) and ghost ward (easy vision control) against weak early laners.

Bone plating is to ensure you don't get dismounted as much (very bad state to be in) when fighting in lane and is more of a lane bully rune than a fighting or poking one.\n\nBone plating is about looking at it's cooldown, and thinking, in 5s bone plating cooldown will be up, which means I need to prepare wave so I don't take as much minion aggro when I do go for a trade. Bone plating provides a brief window where trades are heavily in your favour (provided you don't take minion aggro), and is very much in the 'lane bully' rather than kill lane fashion. You're aiming to take good trades to the point where your opponent cannot contest when you take cs or deny them.\n\nScorch is okay for short trades, but typically Kled isn't a poke champion and he doesn't have much range, so it doesn't really help with short trades as much as bone plating would. Sudden impact is better for extended trading, and is very very powerful on champions who can use it (in lower elo, this keystone is very underrated, and is very strong when used early even on supports like leona and alistair).\n\nCelerity does have some syngery with kled. Since it would give him some extra damage on his ult, and the bonus movespeed on his passive does give a little extra ad, but typically celerity is actually taken for the bonus % movespeed, which kled doesn't have alot of base movespeed, so the reward is rather low. Statwise, you'd be getting alot more out of chyrsalis until the much later stages of the game.\n\nAlso zombie ward is really good for kled, since he often has issues with being able to establish vision control, since whilst dismounted he is very weak, and this makes warding doubly dangerous for kled.\n\nI like theory crafting and running numbers, and looking at playstyles. Scorch only really works with your trap rope, and that cooldown is rather important for making sure kled can get off his trading combo, so using it as poke makes you a bit vulnerable.\n\nAlso you shouldn't often try to lane with kled dismounted so much. Kled's unmounted form is slow and doesn't have as much damage, cc or escape tools, and whilst good for baiting enemies, is very risky. Similar to nautilus, mordekaiser, and nasus , as you climb, you'll encounter issues with enemies who will freeze the lane on your immobile slow champion, and if you try to push up, you will be exploited by enemy jungle.\n\nIn higher elo gameplay, you'll see that when a kled gets dismounted, he'll either be under tower or recalling unless he has jungler to push the lane out for him, and even then sometimes against assassin junglers, the Kled will cede the minion wave to the jungler, because it is too dangerous for kled to be extended so far.","replies":[{"poster":"Nightjar","date":"2018-05-01T04:22:11.271+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I am not an expert on Kled, hell I'm stuck in silver 2 on my main, and have never been higher than gold 4 on any account, I'm awful at league, but those are some observations from watching high elo gameplay, commentaries and just looking at how runes would work with his kit.
