This penalty is removed upon completion of an Enchantment on a Skirmisher&#039;s Sabre or Stalker&#039;s Blade.&quot;\r\n\r\n\r\n*Aim of &#039;Monster Hunter&#039; was to eliminate the gold funneling strategy\r\n\r\n*Monster Hunter achieved this goal, however\r\n\r\n*Junglers who play well and build a lead and an advantage are punished by receiving less gold from minions \r\n\r\n*A crucial component of winning a match is capitalizing on leads and not allowing the enemy to catch up\r\n\r\n*Riot has catch up mechanisms in place for those who are behind to make the game more balanced and allow for &#039;come-backs&#039;\r\n\r\n*Having a system which holds back a player who has built a lead interrupts the flow of the game by turning it into an artificial lead, i.e you&#039;re ahead in gold so now you get less gold thus allowing the enemy to catch up (or you are forced to complete a jungle item, something that I never do on most champions)\r\n\r\n**While I agree that gold funneling needs to be fixed, the current solution is damaging to other aspects of  the game, particularly to junglers who are ahead. I hope Riot catches wind of this post and considers finding a new solution**","replies":[{"poster":"Hellopolite","date":"2018-07-20T17:01:20.722+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"it applies if u have\n-machete\n-talisman\n-machete and talisman\n-stalkers or other combined blade\n\ndoesnt apply if u have\n-completed jungler item\n\nif its really that much of an issue to ur snowball u sell the compartmentalisation because u snowball harder off other items anyway, i doubt it affects you as much as you think, you dont seem to be in that calibre, try futures market + resale value=harder snowballs","replies":[{"poster":"JHooDzz","date":"2018-07-21T00:27:14.563+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"While selling it does eliminate the issue, you stop receiving the exp bonus from jg camps, again putting you at a disadvantage for being ahead which is something Riot has always avoided doing.\n\nJust to give you a perspective as to how harsh Monster Hunter is, \nThe first wave gives a total of 99g, a jungler with active Monster Hunter will get 39g\nThe first Canon Minion wave gives a total of 139g, a jungler with active Monster Hunter will get 69g\nThis has a massive impact on the his ability to gather gold and also, picture this, you're ahead as a jungler and you have a tiamat or some good wave clear, it can often be your job to split push/stop a minion horde.\n\nYou go and clear the a wave with about 13-14 minions in it and you lose your team 130/140 gold in just that instant, go onto push another 2 waves or so to get your minions to a tower and now your team has lost 260 gold total... those are massive numbers considering that we're talking about less than a minute in game.","replies":[{"poster":"Hellopolite","date":"2018-07-21T02:09:44.929+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"you dont snowball a map by farming jungle camps if ur already mid snowball","replies":[]}]}]}]}
