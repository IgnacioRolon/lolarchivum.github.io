I understand that we live in a world where the bullies get everything, but I thought league of legends might of been different.

An argument between two players can easily create a negative experience for the rest of the players in the game with you. Regardless of the other playerâ€™s actions, this does not justify your own behaviour. You alone are responsible for your actions within the game.","replies":[{"poster":"JesusForgotHisGA","date":"2018-08-24T06:53:15.185+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Seras Dragon,realm=OCE,application-id=Ntey9fRZ,discussion-id=nHiExAIk,comment-id=0000,timestamp=2018-08-23T13:05:55.078+0000)\n>\n> I can&#x27;t say I&#x27;ve ever encountered racism/sexism (etc) or suicide encouragement that *hasn&#x27;t* been punished in some way, pretty much always with a 14 day ban. \n> \n> It&#x27;s worth mentioning that Riot have a lot of shortcomings with regard to feedback for reporting players.

I've had a couple of bans not not from verbally abusing people but from calling them out. Somehow this is looked upon as apparently negative and a chat restrictions went my way. At no time was I abusive, racist etc etc.\n\nOn another note if these people are breaking the T&C then why should the be protected and others left in the dark regarding reports? NOT letting people know how their reports when makes it feel trivial and a complete waste of time, especially when you look them up a week or two later and see they're still playing lol.","replies":[{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2018-08-24T07:14:13.492+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Then our experiences drastically differ and I can only speculate as to why.\n\nAs for copping the bans yourself, calling someone out, is not the same as abusing them back. Hence the quote from the IFS FAQ. You are judged on *your* behaviour, and if your behaviour also crosses the lone, even if not as far, you will be punished for it.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"DarkShade918","date":"2018-08-23T23:54:43.025+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I have 3 players on a watch list from my last 12 games, who are yet to be banned (used post-game report and support tickets) 3 weeks and counting, in and even after saying \"KYS\" and \"get cancer and die\".\n\nBut my alt account gets name banned (fixed now thank god) because KYS is in my username (SkyStorm)\n\nso its clear riot don't actually do all that much about it, since they're still playing and still trolling/inting and based on the game my friends shared with one of them still toxic too\n\nits just better to mute and move on, its clear the system doesn't work but rather supports those who are toxic over those defending themselves.\n\nSubmit a report then keep watch on op.gg to see if they're still playing.","replies":[]}]}
