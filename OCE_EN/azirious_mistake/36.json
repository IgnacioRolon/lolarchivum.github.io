So can we please get new sounds for Galactic Azir???","replies":[{"poster":"Azirious Mistake","date":"2014-11-22T00:30:43.051+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"imma try bump this...","replies":[{"poster":"NinjaNumber12","date":"2014-11-23T10:29:45.476+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"bump","replies":[{"poster":"Azirious Mistake","date":"2014-11-23T22:00:59.380+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thank you sir for contributing to the noblest of causes.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"BrbDoingWraiths","date":"2014-11-20T07:36:27.126+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"They would change a skin that has been released so recently.
