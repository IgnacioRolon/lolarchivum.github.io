Her passive is the main focus of her kit, while achieving 5 stacks on an enemy is a daunting and dangerous task because of her low-ish range, Vespin is heavily rewarded for it with lane control over her opponent. But Vespin players must be wary, despite her powerful lane bullying and sustained damage, she lacks the burst needed to effectively trade and her lack of mobility can be crippling once junglers get involved, she has no mobility aside from her ult, which has a hefty cooldown at early levels and is unreliable as an escape, and a mid laner with no other mobility is a tasty snack for all kinds of junglers, as such, Vespin players should be careful about using her ult to escape or to do damage. Vespin&#039;s Stinging Barb is about as vanilla (or honey, in this case) as it gets, its a straight line skillshot that will apply 2 stacks of her passive to the target hit, be it minion or champion. This serves as her main poke ability, with it&#039;s respectable damage and low mana cost, Vespin can use it to whittle her opponent down and apply stacks of her passive or farm from a distance should it come to that. Vespin&#039;s Honey Trail is her bread and butter, or honey for that matter, ok, i&#039;ll stop with the honey puns now. She&#039;ll use it to farm minion waves, escape ganks, set up wicked plays and AoE whole teams to death. While it can be easily walked out of in lane, a well placed Honey Trail in a jungle can set up a pick with its great range or it serves as a reliable disengage tool that can stop an enemy team dead in their tracks, literally. Vespin&#039;s E allows her to establish zone control over melee champions, but can be dispatched with relative ease by ranged champions, who can destroy it with 3 auto attacks, while melees can destroy it with 2 autoattacks, Hive sets up a lot of opportunities for meaningful plays and surprise ambushes, not to mention it gives her incredible control over choke points. In teamfights, Vespin can use a Hive-Honey Trail combo to stun any enemies standing in the area and create a pick to start a fight, alternatively she can hold onto it once a teamfight starts in order to hit a combo on as many enemy champions as possible to ensure the best possible chance of a winning fight or skirmish. Once Vespin hits level 6, she unlocks her ultimate ability, Release the Bees. Upon activation, Vespin will soar into the air and rapid-fire bees at a target location after a brief channel, but because Vespin is quite fat, she can only do it for 3 seconds, the ultimate itself also has quite a small range, forcing her to enter pick-off range in order to shred down those nasty tanks. The passive effect of her ultimate also gives her autoattacks %missing health damage so she can finish off enemies who survive her onslaught, though doing so forces her into auto-attack range, so the player will have to be agile to avoid any CC effects that the enemies may throw at her. Despite the drawbacks on her ult, it serves as Vespin&#039;s main get-out-of-jail-free card, gives her a reliable way of laying down #tonsofbees on enemy champions and, probably best of all, it shreds tanks like it&#039;s no-ones beeswax.\n\nWIP lore: (I&#039;m awful at lore, I do hope to flesh this out in the future and expand upon it, I do have a good grasp of what I want the plot to be but for the time being please bear with me and my awful loreing skills)\n\n> &quot;They are all invaders, man or creature, they all must die.&quot;\n&quot;The bodies of the fallen intruders, what becomes of them?&quot;\n&quot;I do not know, nor do I care, they are not to be trusted, they all try to reason, but words never come out of their mouth, they all die so easily.&quot;\n&quot;They need saving.&quot;\n&quot;They are beyond saving.&quot;\n&quot;No creature is beyond saving, a flower is just a bud before it blooms.&quot;\n&quot;Yet so many die before they are given the chance.&quot;\n&quot;There are more people, flowers waiting to bloom.&quot;\n&quot;They will never know the beauty of life.\n&quot;Unless we show them.&quot;\n&quot;And how do we do that?&quot;\n&quot;The world is bigger than this prison we live in. The world is ours, they just don&#039;t know it yet.&quot;\n&quot;The denizens of flesh, they destroy our kin, our homes.&quot;\n&quot;Perhaps we should destroy theirs.&quot;\n&quot;Our power is strongest in the jungle but when we leave, then what?&quot;\n&quot;We will rebuild this world in our image.
