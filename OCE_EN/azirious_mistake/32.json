Her E makes her a monster early, while most mages get a skillshot or something that can be used every 10 seconds or whatever, kayle gets a constant stream of damage, so if you're willing to take the 100 or so damage from a level 1 mage skillshot you can dish out 3 times that much in autos as they run away. not to mention that with a few points in it, her E becomes basically a permanent buff.","replies":[]}]}]}
