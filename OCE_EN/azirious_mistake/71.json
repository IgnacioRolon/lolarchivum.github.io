I could get over this stupid early game snowball meta if comebacks were possible but unless the enemy team misplays impossibly hard you&#039;re in for a bad time. I&#039;m not sure about you guys but I&#039;ve never had less fun playing LoL than I do at the moment, I hope pre-season fixes this or I&#039;m probably finished.
