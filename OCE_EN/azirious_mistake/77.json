Get rid of the kick if someone picks their champion but doesnt lock in, theres no reason for it and it just makes queue times unbearably long.","replies":[{"poster":"Demodulate","date":"2017-11-16T08:39:30.516+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I agree - I am one of the blind pick subhumans who forgot to lock in my choice, and now I have to wait out the dodge penalty. If I have a champ selected, why can't it be auto-locked when the timer runs out?","replies":[{"poster":"Nightjar","date":"2017-11-16T08:43:39.581+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"yeah this would be a definite improvement to the client and experience in general, especially since alot of the time I'd like to spend the last moments before a match checking my runes and looking up info about my opponents or tips about playing a new lane matchup I haven't yet experienced.","replies":[]}]}]}
