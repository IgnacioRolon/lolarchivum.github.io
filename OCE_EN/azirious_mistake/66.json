Camille is a pretty crazy outplay champion but I can&#039;t seem to play around his kit, between the W&#039;s passive and active movement speed and his Blind, I can close the gap on him but I can&#039;t stick to him and subsequently with his range hes able to get 2 free attacks in on me and if I bait out the blind and then go in I land my stun and Q then he just uses W and runs away and if I go in while his passive is down he simply blinds me and walks away. Any champion-specific counters as well as general Teemo counterplay tips are welcome.\n\n is this a super difficult lane for Camille or am I just bad???\n\n\nHeres the game in question, I got tilted as hell:\nhttp://matchhistory.oce.leagueoflegends.com/en/#match-details/OC1/188550965/200068241?tab=overview\n\nAs you can see I did rush spectre&#039;s cowl but then I just did no damage.","replies":[{"poster":"WoadKethunt","date":"2017-10-14T12:39:48.369+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"you build a tear of the goddess in irl","replies":[]},{"poster":"Akkordian Zoeve","date":"2017-10-14T08:48:40.470+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Your early game relies on ganks (unfortunately). However, once you hit 6, you ought to be able to easily kill him. Once he blinds you, sweep him (if he flashes, then hookshot after him). After that, ult him. By then, his blind will have worn off and be on cooldown, so you will easily be able to out-damage him :)\n\nI hope this helps :)\n\n{{sticker:sg-ahri-2}}","replies":[]}]}
