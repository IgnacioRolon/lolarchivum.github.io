This never used to happen now it happens every game. Am I being punished? Is normal matchmaking broken? Am I too pro for bronze? I just want to play casual games with people of my own skill level because my laptop is too crap for ranked but I just get stomped all the time by skilled players.","replies":[{"poster":"Dat Feel","date":"2015-08-14T09:23:17.129+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"ive been told its because that normals have different elo compared to ranked, so there are many high elo players diamond etc... who play ranked alot but not normals so their normal game elos is alot lower etc.. thus lumping them in with you. I know it sucks being stomped by higher elos but this gives you a chance to see how higher elos play and their warding habits, turret pushes etc... try look on the bright side and try to learn from it because in bronze what you see and learn isnt exactly what you want to see and learn if you want to get to higher elo's","replies":[]}]}
