{"poster":"Azirious Mistake","date":"2015-10-23T07:11:03.331+0000","title":"Done playing until pre-season and this time I mean it","subforum":"Gameplay & Strategy","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"TLDR: I&#039;m done playing League of Legends at least until Riot manages to balance it again.\r\n\r\nThis is mainly because of a few reasons:\r\n1. The games are too stompy. you either roflstomp the enemy of get roflstomped yourself, the window for a possible comeback is way too small as it stands now because of dragon and baron and even common plebs can put your nuts in a tongan death grip until you lose the game.\r\n2. There are too many broken champions. Riot&#039;s recent track record of recent reworks is appalling, we should get a server to test out new things before they get pushed to live servers.\r\nGangplank? Currently broken. \r\nFiora? Got nerfed for being way too broken. \r\nDarius? Trash until Riot buffed him and people discovered how to play him, then was subsequently broken. \r\nGaren? Currently broken, nigh on impossible to shut down properly.\r\nMordekaiser? Broken.\r\nSkarner? Broken on release, then was never to be seen again.\r\n3. The current meta just doesn&#039;t fit my style of play. Ever since Riot decided that all tanks have to do damage the game has lost it&#039;s luster for me because tanks can build absolutely no damage but still out-damage an AD carry. Speaking of AD carries, the bot lane meta is just an arms race and the whole rush crit items meta and most even matchups falling into one persons hands just because they&#039;re a little bit luckier really eats at my soul as i&#039;m sure you know. \r\n4. The behaviour system feels like it doesn&#039;t exist. I understand people have bad games but there are a lot of people out there who dont, on the daily players are told to kill themselves and are sent death threats because they&#039;re 2/7 and the enemy darius is dunking plebs from left to right, ragers run down mid to feed just because they don&#039;t agree with another person&#039;s opinion and diamonds give up on games just because their bot lane makes one little mistake, amongst all the AFKs who are not being punished at all, and through all of this Riot tells us to wait for a new behaviour system that is still not ready yet.\r\n5. Falling behind means staying behind, no ifs or buts. As it stands I feel that players just get punished way too hard for falling behind that it&#039;s almost unfair especially when the enemy just jumps on you and you&#039;re dead before you can do anything about it, you can try all you want but you can&#039;t skillfully outplay someone when they do twice as much damage as you and in my opinion that is bullcrap, as an ADC 1/4 with 80 farm, even if you have Infinity Edge you barely leave a dent in anyone and they leave twice as big a dent in you. When you play a tank you&#039;re hardly tanky enough to initiate for your team and if you try to do so then you are dead and your team will likely follow. As a mage everyone just ignores your low damage combos like they&#039;re nothing and then kills you in quick, decisive fashion. And if you&#039;re an assassin and you give up a kill in lane, prepare yourself for 50 minutes of not being relevant.\r\n\r\nNow I&#039;ve been almost obnoxiously pro-riot ever since I started playing this game and I&#039;m willing to wait to see what the pre-season offers but until then I&#039;m done with this game and I&#039;m done throwing money at Riot, if you actually managed to make it this far, have a cookie. {{item:2010}}","replies":[{"poster":"xXxRenektonxXx23","date":"2015-10-23T16:33:50.472+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"NOBODYFUCKINGCARES (sorry)","replies":[]},{"poster":"DragonOfTheVoid","date":"2015-10-23T10:42:29.774+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"this is what the 40th time you have sed this","replies":[{"poster":"Azirious Mistake","date":"2015-10-23T11:12:39.671+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I actually mean it, I'm not touching this game with a 10 foot pole at least until the pre-season patch.","replies":[{"poster":"TeCoolMage","date":"2015-10-24T01:32:16.924+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'm sure the boards is at least 5 ft away from the game so a 10 ft pole is a bit too much","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Tele","date":"2015-10-23T11:34:50.773+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Ahaha not playing until pre-season isn't a very big commitment at this point, we are literally one patch away from pre-season.
