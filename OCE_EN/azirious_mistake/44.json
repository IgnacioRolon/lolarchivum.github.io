I get that it's fun when you get your champ but, it's basically like ARAM with no rerolls, you have a chance but no guarantee. I understand really wanting to play that one champion just once but if that's the case just keep picking it till you get it and enjoy the other champs along the way. If you really hate a champion make like it and dodge it, noones getting punished for dodging featured gamemodes or ARAMS (as far as I know anyway). \n\nIf you know you're not going to have fun playing a champ, simple, don't play it. And I really don't understand the people that get into games and then only at the end of the game when they're losing go \"Oh my god what expletive picked champion %@$#^ idiots\". And not to mention the ones that assume the champ you have is weak rather than simply considering the enemy's champ/players is/are stronger. Had that one last night :/ end of the game the two guys who didn't pick it start spouting \"Why the #$#@ would you pick Swain he's so stupid\" Instead of just considering we were verseing true damage and percentage health galore in 5 Vaynes with 5 BotRKs.....and the fact that it's a featured gamemode and we're just trying to have fun....","replies":[{"poster":"Project Xayah","date":"2015-10-19T03:24:47.839+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> noones getting punished for dodging featured gamemodes or ARAMS\n\nJust an FYI, you get punished for dodging in all matchmade games.","replies":[{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2015-10-19T05:27:01.164+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"well I said as far as I know (at least I think I did) I don't do it often (and never in SR games/ARAMs, only featured like OFA) and I've never gotten warned for it, so I just figured they didn't for featured gamemode....The more you know I guess","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"GigaPube","date":"2015-10-17T21:42:03.611+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"its literally just a toxic aram every damn game. could not think of any situation other than every ofa ive played as to a worse team experience ive been in, and then just altogether they're just shit, including a vlad on my team starting with fucking flask.
