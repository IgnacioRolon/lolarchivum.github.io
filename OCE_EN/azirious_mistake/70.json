Procing electrocute lategame is difficult for some assassins without dying since their combos have longer cast times. It's also especially good on assassins who can chain kills like kha'zix and yi, to regain soul charge.\n\nI think dark harvest is a fine concept, and aa based junglers have other options through precision (the sustained damage one, as opposed to burst in domination) in lethal tempo or press the attack that are superior mid-lategame.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Akkordian Zoeve","date":"2017-11-14T01:49:44.842+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It works well on Eve.","replies":[{"poster":"Azirious Mistake","date":"2017-11-14T08:38:31.432+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Evelynn has a lot of viable keystone runes though.","replies":[{"poster":"Akkordian Zoeve","date":"2017-11-14T08:42:14.894+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'm not saying she doesn't.
