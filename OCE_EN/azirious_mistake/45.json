Kog'Maw now has a reduction on that base damage whenever he uses his W, but not on typical on hit effects - as below:\n\n> While Bio-Arcane Barrage is active, Kog'Maw's basic attacks deal 55% damage to non-minions, though on-hit effects are still fully applied.\n\nThis means that things like Nashor's Tooth, Wit's End, Rageblade, Blade of The Ruined King and Hurricane (now applies onhit effects too) are going to be much relatively much stronger on Kog'Maw, due to being applied roughly 2x more than other marksmen.","replies":[]}]}]}
