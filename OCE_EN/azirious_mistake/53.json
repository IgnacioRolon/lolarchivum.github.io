While the effect is active she can then reactivate her ult to land or automatically land after the duration ends, casting Skystrike at the area. While in the air, her position will be revealed to allies and enemies alike, and if the duration ends and Quinn is above terrain, she will cast Skystrike at the closest passable terrain (like flash).\r\n\r\n{{champion:133}} {{champion:133}} {{champion:133}} {{champion:133}}","replies":[{"poster":"TeCoolMage","date":"2015-10-01T09:11:58.660+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Seems nice but people already hate the fact Valor and Quinn aren't as close as Kindred for some reason, and it would be a bit like Pantheon's ult.\n\nOther than that, I just hate the fact Valor's size is literally impossible to keep track of and Quinn somehow has the strength of Pantheon.","replies":[{"poster":"Azirious Mistake","date":"2015-10-01T10:38:29.590+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"\"Other than that, I just hate the fact Valor's size is literally impossible to keep track of and Quinn somehow has the strength of Pantheon.\"\n\nCan you please explain what you mean by this???","replies":[{"poster":"Project Xayah","date":"2015-10-01T10:45:46.896+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The consistency of Valor's size is questionable.
