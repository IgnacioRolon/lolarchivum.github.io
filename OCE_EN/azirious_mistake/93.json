( W )\r\nPassive: Gains 10/20/30/40/50% attack speed.\r\n\r\nI can get with this, now Azir actually has to reach lategame to attain his full power and means he won&#039;t stomp face with morellonomicon and sorc shoes and gives Azir players a little incentive to max W second after Q, which a lot of people already do. Furthermore the removal of Will of the Emperor opens up a lot more diversity in his build paths and this change will make him more durable throughout all stages of the game as well since scaling CDR will no longer be a requirement.\r\n\r\nShifting Sands ( E )\r\nNo longer knocks up enemies or grants shield.\r\n\r\nThis is what irks me though, Azir can either have the Shield or the knock-up, but please for the love of Shurima don&#039;t take both, this will heavily affect Azir&#039;s playstyle and will degrade E&#039;s purpose to simply being an escape, nothing more than an escape. Azir players should be rewarded for diving headfirst into trades and teamfights but this nerf removes what is a core aspect of his kit and outright ruins his ability to make interesting plays.\r\n\r\nBut what I don&#039;t understand most of all is why nerf a champion who is strong in a tank meta which is already starting to get phased out, now that tanks are seeing less play, theres less peel, and now that theres less peel, we all know what role of champions will be making a comeback, thats right, scrubby burst assassins that wreck Azir. I simply ask that you hold off on nerfing him and at least monitor how he goes as the meta shifts again and again and again.","replies":[{"poster":"GoMeXz","date":"2015-07-11T00:17:46.551+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"{{champion:268}}  its gonna be to weak, :c","replies":[]},{"poster":"Jink","date":"2015-07-10T01:34:44.977+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Scrubby burst Assassins are back?\n\nAwesome.","replies":[]}]}
