Everyone who was kicking up a stink about Warlord&#039;s Bloodlust being OP just forgot about Deathfire Touch and it&#039;s nonexistent cooldown, so what this means is that if your champion has good sustained damage then they&#039;re probably really f*cking strong, except Azir, but even then he got some really good buffs.\n\nAlso in a bizarre twist, Kog'Maw, who alot of players perceived as a strong champion sits at a sub-40% win rate, the league of early game is eating our precious void puppy alive.","replies":[{"poster":"GigaPube","date":"2015-11-17T02:58:18.732+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"the problem with AP champs is that the AD champs and their items and masteries are far stronger, more versatile, have better room for teammates to play around and had the least amount of nerfs to their items (mainly with the gold cost)","replies":[]},{"poster":"Tele","date":"2015-11-16T02:25:21.743+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Kog'Maw will be a problem in pro-play, because as soon as you can communicate and draft teams around him he gets really OP.","replies":[]}]}
