It&#039;s supposed to be free after all.&quot; \r\nYeah, well we all know how _that_ turns out.\r\nMy reply? Always the same. \r\n\r\n&quot;In Riot I see a company with a huge commitment to its players and consistently delivering a quality service in which I have spent thousands of hours enjoying with both friends and strangers. Riot has been able to admit their mistakes, learn from them, move on and, most importantly, try to be as transparent as possible with their decision making. I love having new content on the PBE every two weeks; one of my first activities each day is checking what the latest news is. And the red posts, oh my god, not only does Riot keep their game new and fresh with the addition of new content_ every two weeks_, but they _actually communicate with the people playing it_. Here is a company that is committed to communication and quality. \r\nAnd that is why I can justify spending money on League.&quot;\r\n\r\nRiot is leagues above their competition.\r\nI&#039;ve even made a pact to myself, instead of spending money on the products of Riots&#039; competitors, who consistently fail to achieve the same standard of dedication, communication and quality (Bli$$ard), I would instead purchase lotto tickets, because I could never really shake the feeling of just being a cash cow to these other companies and this would be a better use of my time and money instead. Riot was the only exception here.\r\n\r\nI would be proud to call myself a Riot fanboy.\r\n\r\n\r\nI wouldn&#039;t go as far as to say that I&#039;ve completely lost the warm fuzzy feeling I&#039;ve been accustomed to getting from Riot, but I cannot fathom how the decision to completely remove dominion isn&#039;t a complete and utter snub to the fans of the Dominion game mode.\r\nYes, I will admit that only a tiny percentage plays Dominion but it&#039;s a dedicated and tight-nit community. \r\nEven though OCE has no queue for Dominion, when I&#039;ve wanted to play I&#039;ve rarely had trouble finding enough players within a reasonable amount of time. And this is in the custom game lobby too. But Riot wants to remove Dominion from here as well.\r\n\r\nWe all rejoiced when Riot announce OCE servers, so long were the games of 180 ping, but where was our beloved Dominion? \r\nThe queue removed and Riot all but silent on the issue.\r\nA few of us from the Dominion community created several threads on the topic, and we heard _**nothing**_ in response, from a company that I staunchly believed was one of the best at communication. I let it slide, maybe that was my first mistake? I could always play in customs.\r\n\r\nBut to add insult to injury, I wake up this morning to find the first Dominion news in over 3 years is that  they&#039;re going to remove it completely?\r\nHow does this happen? \r\n\r\nSure we got a half promise that it _may_ come back in the future, that it _might_ be a featured game mode _soon_, in the fullness of time, at the appropriate junctures. Yeah, sounds awfully familiar.\r\n\r\nAnd all of this due to a resourcing issue? I&#039;m sorry but, you haven&#039;t touched Dominion in over 4 years, yes that hurts, but it was better than nothing.\r\nWhat is the harm in just leaving it as a custom map? The people who enjoy it will utilize it and the people that don&#039;t, won&#039;t.\r\n\r\nYou want to talk to me about resourcing issues? What about all the featured game modes that come for only a week or two each year? What about the Butchers Bridge version of ARAM? Why not, at the very least, do we not have a rotating queue for each of these games modes every weekend or two?\r\nI&#039;m sorry, but when you pour more development resources into these temporary modes, that have been around for a fraction of the time that Dominion has, that argument doesn&#039;t sit well with me.\r\n\r\nAnd the consolation?\r\nA &#039;never to be reproduced icon?&#039;\r\nSure I love my icons, but there hasn&#039;t been a Dominion queue on OCE since it&#039;s inception? How is that fair?\r\nA rare icon? Yeah, no thanks. I&#039;d rather my favorite game mode back.\r\n\r\nI honestly believed that Riot was better than this, in so many ways. Am getting old and cynical? \r\nIs 21 really the age where everything starts to taste sour and is never as good as it was back in the 90&#039;s?\r\n\r\nWhen the next set of skins is released, perhaps it&#039;s time I bought another lotto ticket instead.\r\nAt least that way I don&#039;t have to bend completely over.\r\n\r\n\r\nTLDR: Just read the damn post you bum.","replies":[{"poster":"Tele","date":"2016-02-12T09:17:07.137+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"As you know, **Dominion** wasn't doing too well. Only 0.5% of the community was playing it, and a large amount of that figure was bots. The resources and staff used on Dominion could be better allocated to other areas of the game, to benefit more **players**.\n\nYou could say:\n> What is the harm in just leaving it as a custom map? The people who enjoy it will utilize it and the people that don't, won't.\n\n + Riot has standards. If they aren't going to support a game-mode anymore (which means no bug fixes), they don't want to just watch it become disgrace to their name. \n\n If they aren't able to do it right, no point in doing it at all. They're better off getting down to work on a big project, to improve the game.\n\nThe next biggest complaint is:\n> There hasn't been a Dominion queue on OCE since it's inception? How is that fair?\n\n+ That's because OCE's community wasn't large enough to support Dominion without ridiculous queue times. I still have a video somewhere of 3 hour queue time for Team Builder. _Can you imagine Dominion?_\n\nEither way, just because a game feature was never available to you, but it was to others, doesn't make it necessarily unfair.\n\n I never got to play beta and enjoy all the crazy new builds, I never got to to play** Rengar** or **Kassandin** before their reworks. \n\n _Should those be brought back for any players who missed out?_\n\nI don't think so. We have awesome new content to enjoy and explore now, with more on the way. Those things were fun, but they've passed on for varying reasons.\n\nIt's time to look to the future. Sure Dominion is gone now, but we have new modes to look forward to, old modes like URF coming back, new champions and maybe even League of Legends Supremacy or some other new game.\n\nThat's how I see it anyway :D","replies":[]},{"poster":"Roguestoney","date":"2016-02-12T11:49:21.371+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Best tl;dr ever.","replies":[]}]}
