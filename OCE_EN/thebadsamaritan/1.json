She could easily out trade if i try to  engage her and whenever i try to poke and I&#039;m not EXTREMELY careful i&#039;ll fall in range of her ult/q. I tried playing passive and agressively and neither seem to work cuz she doesn&#039;t quite have low enough hp for me to kill early and has more than enough damage to wreak me late. \r\n\r\nPLEASE HELP T_T","replies":[{"poster":"Jink","date":"2015-10-07T21:12:26.341+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"You have poke and she doesn't.","replies":[]},{"poster":"I am Qwerty","date":"2015-10-09T02:40:36.219+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The advantages you have as Ahri over Annie is that you have more mobility and more waveclear. Annie is a really idiot-proof champ and extremely easy to play so it can be hard outplaying her. This is what I do in this matchup, instead of trying to straight up mechanically outplay her (which you can with enough practice), you keep shoving the lane with your Q and use your mobility advantage to roam to other lanes, mostly I roam bot coz the top laner is usually too tanky and there's one more person to kill in bot. In low elo, you can even catch their jungler off halfway through their camps. If you're just focusing on the 1v1 mechanical outplay part, then you'll just need a lot of practice. It is extremely important to land your skillshots in lane as Ahri as that is more or less all your damage. You'll just need a lot of practice landing the skillshots while trying to stay out of range of Annie. This isn't something that just comes overnight and you'll just need to be patient and keep practicing. Also be careful when Annie has her 3rd stack of her passive. Good Annie's will sometimes leave their passive at 3 stacks, Q you and use their e while their Q is in mid-air to activate their stun right before it hits you.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Olee","date":"2015-10-07T23:16:53.858+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hi, fellow Ahri main here to help. For the lane phase, some advantages you have over Annie are range, mobility and sustain. Poke with Q often and run away, try and hit it at max range because none of her abilities have the same range as your Q and she will have trouble trading back. When you throw out a Q just to make you don't take any extra harass, run backwards using the MS steroid your Q gives you. At 6, it becomes more of a skill matchup but remember, her ult IS still technically a skillshot and for someone who has lots of mobility like Ahri, it can end badly for Annie. E.G, you catch her in an EQW and you look like you wanna all in off of it, ult in another direction as soon as the Charm CC wears off and she'll most likely fuck up Tibbers. Or if your reactions are quick enough, as soon as she flashes forward ult sideways. In terms of item builds, building an Abyssal Scepter and/or an Athene's Unholy Grail will work. Whether you need both of those or just one will depend on how far ahead she is. Always watch out for her stun and shove lane against her when it is safe. Always tell your team to not bunch up in the mid to late game.\n\nI personally think Annie is the most broken champ in the game but what can you do?","replies":[]},{"poster":"DW GunGale","date":"2015-10-07T21:48:55.317+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Building a Chalice first would give you a bit of help.\n\nAlways keep an eye on her stun. Switch between passive and aggressive accordingly. What's great about Ahri is her ability to poke with her q. So maximize this and try to poke her down as much as you can so she doesn't have the opportunity to engage you in an actual fight that she will probably lose.\n\nUtilize your ult. You have so much mobility with Ahri's ult. Try and predict Annie's stun/ult and work on dodging it. Later on in the game you should be able to burst her down fast enough that she doesn't have the chance to stun you (if you land a charm).\n\nBuilding extra magic resistance might help or a Zhonyas to r, zhonyas (bait the ult). \n\nJust suggestions. I don't play Ahri a lot so I wouldn't know much.","replies":[]},{"poster":"SorakaXHealBoT","date":"2015-10-07T21:18:21.871+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Rush {{item:3001}} or get {{item:1057}} on your first back. Ahri's base damage is pretty high so its ok to build a negatron cloak 1st.","replies":[]}]}
