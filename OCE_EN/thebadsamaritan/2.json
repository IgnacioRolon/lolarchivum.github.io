I&#039;m sick and tired of pussies who can&#039;t just simply cope with the fact that these are real people they&#039;re paying with, they actually have emotions, and if you ruin the game for them, that is approximately a combined 4 hours of peoples life wasted. And most likely another 4 hours of effort to get what was lost back. \r\n\r\nEven for the opponent team i personally hate it when nobody is able to enjoy the game because some dude on the other team thinks that raining salt to possibly annoy (if not piss off) the opposing team might earn some degree of toughness. And to those guys I would just like to say: If your getting pissed over a dammed game. I wonder what would happen when you come across an actual problem.\r\n\r\nThat will be my little rant, to be honest I could be just trying to get rid of some rage over the retards who make this game bad. hope this might actually make some sort of difference though.
