I tried to get a full log of it but there's another error that prevents me from getting a full log. No idea why, game was fine last night. Oh and this morning had a ghost poro bug (and client shut downs) 3 times today.\r\n\r\nGhost poro problem - played zoe, in champ select i switched from eyeball collection to ghost poro. In game I was unable to deploy any ghost poros at all, throughout the entire game, i say entire game but i quickly crashed while in lane phase, and couldn't load in again. \r\n\r\nI've done a trouble shoot, looked through old boards, and tried some suggestions on fixing the problem, still no luck. Games get a memory dump error and no log can be produced. error 00... something something","replies":[]}
