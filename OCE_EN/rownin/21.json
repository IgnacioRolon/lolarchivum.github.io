Even though our comp is better, or everyone else is doing great in terms of cs, xp, objectives etc. y they gotta ruin it for everyone else?\r\n\r\nI know its a rage quit and not a dc coz of their attitude in chat and the '/all', even if the entire team is trynna be supportive, legit actually supportive and not being toxic, or if everyone's silent, they gotta feel like they have to make a play or else its game over (o/4/0) 1v2. \r\n\r\nI've noticed its generally the adc or support, if either one is over extending and gets killed by 1v2 or gank, they either immediately rage quit, or say some not nice things to the other (like adc blamming support and vice versa). sometimes its the fact that tehy are over extended or jungler is topside and they calling for ganks... and just go absolute ham when they get ganked before team jungler is anywhere near. \r\n\r\nI've had the best of teams, and worst, but the worst sticks on, as my plat shield expires, &lt;30% winrate constant rage quitters or chat fights...","replies":[{"poster":"Exarch Leona","date":"2019-11-03T10:04:29.305+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I mean, gold has more rage quitters (average of 2 a game) \n\n>I've noticed its generally the adc over extends and gets killed by 1v2 or gank*\n\nFixed it.\n\nEither way, Riot have stated in a ticket I submitted late last month that this issue an issue and players are not in the wrong for rage quitting because it does not impact the game. \n\nI'm only telling you what I was told.","replies":[{"poster":"Rownin","date":"2019-11-05T23:10:52.013+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Well that's stupid, it affects the game severely... there's been times  where i legit wanted to rage quit, but i stayed coz it wasnt fair to the others just because one dude was griefing/inting hard,  and we won. Rage quitting is an easy way out of your problems, you don't learn. \n\nAnd its such a satisfying feeling when you guys make a comeback. People are super concerned witht heir KDA. \n\n0/3/0 early game = ragequit... kayle.. you're a late game beast... your early game sucks, everyone knows that. \n\nRage quitters affect the game for everyone else.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Bring me my belt","date":"2019-11-01T08:08:15.498+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Our servers are toxic, it's near season end, plus everyone is playing urf, probs best to get a duo have a game see how that goes before you play another","replies":[]},{"poster":"Broken Scripts","date":"2019-11-01T01:30:02.461+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Because plat is elo hell.
