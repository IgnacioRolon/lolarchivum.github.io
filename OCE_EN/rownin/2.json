The normal ring itself is not visible making it very hard to clearly know where the shroud lies and grows. the parts of her shroud disappear  and reappear all over the lane aswell, disappears when w is finished.\r\n\r\nPlease help.","replies":[{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2018-12-09T07:45:06.193+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It sounds like it's probably a local file issue.\n\nTry running a **client repair** through settings (the gear icon top right) > Initiate Full Repair.\n\nIf that doesn't work try **reinstalling the game** with the [Hextech Repair Tool](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/202539040-Reinstalling-League-of-Legends).\n\nIf that still doesn't fix your issue **submit a ticket** to [Player Support](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/requests/new) and they should be able to help you further.","replies":[]}]}
