This is just a personal rant taking up space on the boards. Like I always do. \r\n\r\nanyways, if you&#039;ve stuck this far into my rant, sorry you had to hear all that. Alrighty then, time to climb out of bronze once more, see how long this&#039;ll take me, hopefully not too long.\r\n\r\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\nP.s. I hate leave buster, seen it soo many times, and everytime its always the same message and that annoying count down from 20 minutes. And each time I lag, afk or crash, its always something out of my control but then again, the luck that I has never givenme the chance to play a game without any interuption whatsoever.\r\n\r\nTo the point where I went out and played lol at a games cafe to avoid interuptions and all that, whatdya know a guy accidently kicks the power cable shutting down my computer. and lost us thegame. \r\n\r\nWhat good fun my life with gaming is","replies":[{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2019-02-18T13:27:35.628+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"So the way I see it you have two basic questions:\n\n* Why did I get placed after one game?\n\nYou aren't placed yet, this is a provisional rank. Only you can see it, it is not visible on your profile to anyone else. It is in essence, a minimum. However the rest of your placements go, you cannot be placed below that rank. While in your 10 provisional games, LP gains are accelerated, there are no promos, and you cannot lose LP at all. \n\nMost players' *placement* rank will be at least a few divisions below their end of season rank, so having a much lower *provisional* rank is not unusual. (e.g, My end of season: P4, Provis rank: G4, Placement rank [8W 2L] G1).\n\n\n* Why do I get LPQs for things beyond my control?\n\nUltimately, because of the effect you are having on other players. It well understood that shit happens. Your internet cuts out, computer blue screens, power goes out etc, and this is precisely why you get a few free leaves (for normals, you obvs still lose LP for ranked) before facing LeaverBuster.\n\nHowever, even if you aren't intentionally leaving, at a point Riot have to consider the other 9 players in each of those games. If you find yourself in a position where your computer is causing you to leave enough to trigger LPQs, you need to start looking at why.","replies":[{"poster":"Rownin","date":"2019-02-19T05:47:47.090+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"its understandable.\n\nI know that. Ruins the game for the other 9 players, have had many games with dc'sand afkers to know how frustratingit can be (once had 7 straight gamesof afker's, 3 games of which I've faced 2 or more afk'ers lmao), problem isnt really my computer (i wouldve looked for a new one long time ago, I know I made it sound like its my computer but its not that for the most part) majority of the time its due to random events in real life not related to my potato at all, like when i played at the internet cafe lol. Anyways its completely understandable, I just wish I wasn't soo unlucky when it comes to my spare time. This was just a rant, I didn't expect anything to come out of it or gain anything lol, just typed away whilst in lpq, but thank you for a reply. \n\nhave a nice day","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Rownin","date":"2019-02-18T06:03:35.273+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"lol, I have to seclude myself from everything and everyone just to play a simple game, just 1 game. lmao even then it wont work coz something just has to happen to ruin the game, even if i tried playing on board a space station, probably a meteor shower or aliens, idk something to just ruin the game.
