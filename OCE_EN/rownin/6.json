Although, on NA servers im getting a decent stable game with hardly any lagg at 112 ping,  compare tht to OCE...  I live in the OCE region and considering tht I'm in Australia and playing in NA servers  with hardly any lagg, u'd think tht playing in an OCE region based server would have lower pings and run games more smoothly for those playing in oce servers and are in the OCE region.  \r\n\r\n{{item:3070}}  {{item:3070}} {{item:3070}} {{item:3070}}\r\n\r\nThis is ridiculous, I mean after the rewards and acheivements ( getting a gifted skin from rito and leader banner :P yh don't judge m, I think they r achievements lol) i've done, I can never rly play a lagg free game till this is fixed. Pls don't send me to virus links and say its internet tests.......","replies":[{"poster":"Rownin","date":"2015-01-29T02:55:53.651+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"hey thx for answerin :D \n\n- In Melbourne\n- Optus\n- ADSL \n- Wireless\n- nope\n- haven't had ping issues on NA servers\n\nThx again, hope this helps pinpoint any problems","replies":[{"poster":"Mindstar","date":"2015-01-29T05:40:33.825+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"If possible, could you please run the [network diagnostic test](http://oce.leagueoflegends.com/tools/network-logs), and email the results to riottoxichawk@riotgames.com.\n\nConnecting from Melbourne, you should see great response times as our OCE game servers are in Sydney.

The vast majority of players in Oceania should see something closer to the 20 - 40 you describe (depending on location, of course)\n\nA few questions:\n\n* What city are you in?\n* What internet provider do you use?\n* What type of connection do you have?  (eg. ADSL / Cable / Fibre)\n* Do you connect your computer to your home network via wireless or via a network cable?\n* Do you use any kind of VPN service?\n* Do you have the same ping issues on the NA servers as the OCE servers?\n\n-Mindstar","replies":[{"poster":"HORSE OF FORCE","date":"2015-01-29T03:25:39.047+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"http://boards.oce.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/help-support-oce/rxMg0qHY-oce-ping-rates-over-the-moon?comment=0001","replies":[]}]}]}
