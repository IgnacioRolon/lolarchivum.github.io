This happens every time after I just boot up my computer after the latest patch. and all I get is reconnect button that sends me into a bug splatting loop. To fix it I have to do some really annoying steps before I can play, which is really annoying. After every computer start up. Takes a while too. \r\n\r\nYes I have reinstalled and league has done some automatic repairs as well. Problem still persists. I've been getting a whole lotta problems with this month and I have no clue why. \r\n\r\nPlease help.","replies":[{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2019-04-13T08:40:44.654+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"1.
