I've posted one of my rants before giving just a taste of what happens to me during my free time when im playing  (i.e. played at a games cafe and some dude kicks the power cable by accident) . After ending a previous leavebuster probably like a day or so, (I got that one for an emergency situation irl.. kitchen on fire coz sis was trynna cook the cake with her 'new cooking technique') I get slapped with another one because i dc during loading screen.
