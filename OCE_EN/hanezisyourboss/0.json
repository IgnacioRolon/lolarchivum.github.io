Please check your internet connection&quot;. \n\nMy internet is running completely perfect . The first time it resulted in a remake losing 18 LP, the client functions as normal. I thought their maybe a error with the client, so i initiated a FULL REPAIR, and then found another ranked match, and the same thing happened, resulting in another remake (losing 16LP) and 5 games in low tier queue.\n\nHas anyone else had similar issues and can point me in a direction to fixing the issue?\n\n(Prior to this issue, i had been playing LOL for 8 or so hours, and then this issue just seemed to happen.","replies":[{"poster":"Sky Show","date":"2017-12-14T21:47:59.926+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"same like your problem. since 4 day can not connect to a single game. even Training and custom games.
