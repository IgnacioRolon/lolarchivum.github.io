How is it done? And what does it achieve?\n\nI saw some videos on it and thought it was quite interesting.\nFor those who don&#039;t know, I believe it&#039;s something to do with increasing the range of abilities by rapid input of movement in a specific pattern during the animation of the ability(?)\nIt has been mentioned that it can be used on champions like Thresh and Blitzcrank, and that it was discovered by Toyz (hence the name) on Orianna.\nI&#039;ve searched through the internet to try find it but it seems I&#039;ve hit a dead end.\n\n**Links:**\nHere, an informational League of Legends YouTuber (Bodytags) uploaded a video of it, which was later corrected by a high level coach (LastShadow9). But all the videos doesn&#039;t specifically show how it&#039;s done.\nWrong:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XveH_iZzMpU\nCorrected:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1bnslWIsvT8\n\nHere&#039;s another one of LastShadow&#039;s coaching videos which goes over a little bit of the Toyz technique.
