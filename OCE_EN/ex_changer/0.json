I have 5% cdr from masteries so the q and w have a 5.7 second cooldown. \r\n\r\nChecking LoLwiki, it says that the heat decays after 4 seconds, but that would mean that i should have around 0 heat by the time either &#039;q&#039; or &#039;w&#039; come off cooldown, which is not the case for &#039;q&#039;, in which only 10 heat will have been lost (net gain of 10 heat). It is however consistent with what occurs for &#039;w&#039; (0 heat gain by the time it comes of cooldown).\r\nAlso, checking with the &#039;e&#039;, the cooling down seems to start after 4 seconds after the first cast, regardless of the second cast, which is consistent with LoLwiki and the &#039;w&#039;.\r\n\r\nSo basically, i&#039;m wondering if i&#039;m misunderstanding something here about his heat mechanic or whether there is a bug about how his heat works. I am hoping you guys can help me clear this up.\r\n\r\n(Sorry if this post is poor, this is my first ever post)","replies":[{"poster":"Lilja","date":"2015-07-30T03:02:20.089+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"While I do agree with checking the wiki for things like that sort of info, it must be noted that it is not stated anywhere in the game itself how rumbles heat dissipates, and also the wiki has no affiliation with riot so it isnt always 100% accurate on everything.\n\nIts a good eye to spot it, but it was intended.","replies":[]},{"poster":"eX Changer","date":"2015-07-28T11:31:55.061+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> We slightly increased the amount of time it takes for Heat to start falling after casting Flamespitter to go along with the cooldown change, so it should be relatively the same. If it is no longer working the way Rumble players intend it to, we'll fix it ASAP. \n\nAlright, I have discovered why this is the case. It turns out it is a hidden effect of flamespitter added back in 2011 when his cooldown was nerfed. This essentially made it so it is possible to build up heat using the q.

It seems like there is a different cooling down time after using flamespitter compared to using scrap shield, and i'm wondering that is a bug. If the cooling down period occurs after 4 seconds, then there should be no reason why the flamespitter builds up heat by spamming, while scrap shield does not.  (They both have the same cooldown so should build up heat in the same way)","replies":[]}]}]}
