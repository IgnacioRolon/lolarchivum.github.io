Even though I played him a lot, ill admit he had problems. He was kinda simple, and there was nothing notable about him, other then Elastic slingshot and his passive. The problem I have is that his rework, plus the tank item changes, have taken a basic but reliable champion, and made him flashy, but so much less reliable.\n\nFor me, the new ultimate is ok. It lacks the old ults front line chaos, but it packs more options in how you can use it. It is however, way too easy to escape from. Any champion with a blink or a dash (so at least half of all champions, and virtually all carries) can easily get out of it before you can finish the channel. On top of that, it only does damage if its fully channeled, which kinda just makes a small problem into a big one.\n\nThe Q on the other hand, I do have a lot of problems with. If it wasn't for the fact that the buffed auto is so much shorter ranged then the initial cast, I would be alright with it. Unfortunately, you basically need to hit Q, then walk right next to your opponent for the second. This may not seem bad, but unless you have enemy minions next to you, I honestly don't see the point in casting Q. I actually wish the initial range was shorter, and the enhanced auto was longer ranged, just to make the ability feel consistent.\n\nThe health item changes are another big problem, since now abilities that deal percent health damage are weaker (Unstable matter), and its overall been a net reduction to his ability to tank damage.\n\nSo yeah. I do actually think that reworking him wasn't a terrible idea, but I do think that his rework was handled rather poorly.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Righteous Rage","date":"2017-05-05T00:12:00.279+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I am right there with you.  Nothing against the people that are downvoting, but personally I find his ult is incredibly easy to get out of if you are trying to grab them.
