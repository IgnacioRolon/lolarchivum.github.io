I can open the client fine and get through champ select but each time I begin loading into the game I met with a black screen that eventually pops up with the message saying that I have failed to connect to the server. Again this has only happened on 5.14, 5.16, 5.18 and now 5.20. All other patches have worked without a problem. If anyone can provide any insight to the cause of this and moreso how I can fix it that would be greatly appreciated.\r\n\r\ntl;dr can&#039;t load into games on even patches.\r\n\r\nThanks, Grkd131","replies":[{"poster":"Talons","date":"2015-10-14T07:17:13.826+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"same thing is happening to me, but im getting a different error this time and it has seemed to effect my whole lobby.
