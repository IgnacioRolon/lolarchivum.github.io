How do I Mana.","subforum":"Gameplay & Strategy","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Like many ARAM players the 4.20 changes devestated me with the vast overhaul to mana items. No longer can I simply equip a chalice and non-stop spam spells while stacking pure damage. Needless to say the many fun face roll champs our now.. feeling far weaker.\r\n\r\nTo be clear, I am not a Smurf and own close to 100 champions if not more, I do enjoy playing other champions in ARAM. However I understand that it is Wukong's Job to play CC - Intiator - Tank and Zigg's job to wreck face.\r\n\r\nI have had very little luck with trying to find a new build, suitable for these Mages.\r\n\r\n**FAILED ATTEMPS**\r\n\r\nChalice - Boot: Oh dear, how dissapointing, based off total mana missing now? Should I simply stack mana runes, will it make a difference? Will not sustain me.\r\n\r\n3x Doran Rings: A nice mix of defense and damage but alas, once again the mana is no good!\r\n\r\nTear + Morello Seed: The best start I've found so far, still no where near the chalice of yesteryear, however it has no damage, what is one to do.\r\n\r\nTear + Chalice: An extra 1000G just to get the same mana regen the old chalice would give you... it's tough out there for a mage.\r\n\r\nPlease I'm asking, does anyone know of the a mana build which will sustain me, items, runes, masteries there must be someone who knows.","replies":[{"poster":"Zaps","date":"2014-12-17T00:35:30.824+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Getting an early Forbidden Idol and then buying any potions you need is pretty underrated. It's only 600 gold, and builds into Morellonomicon. You can also grab boots or dorans ring along with that.  The advantage here is that Morellonomicon is pretty much stronger than Grail for ARAM now. With potions, this is more regen than grabbing a tear as well for the early game, and you can still afford to buy some AP along with it.","replies":[{"poster":"Mid Dumbledore","date":"2014-12-17T21:15:41.757+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Forbidden Idol ... such an unused item.

Granted you lose out on ap however in my opinion as you lvl quickly early you are always regaining health and mana hope this helped :)","replies":[]},{"poster":"Kureha","date":"2014-12-16T08:21:27.303+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yeah me too been having the same problem, I personally got chalice, and faerie charm. The only problem is that you get no potion, but it does do a good for early game. (no damage though) I would just suggest the chalice and tear","replies":[]},{"poster":"Project Xayah","date":"2014-12-16T07:24:38.266+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I just build chalice to start then into athenes.
