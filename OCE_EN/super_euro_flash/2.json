Why? I've barely said anything over the last 50 games. Considering I've just dropped over $200 onto the account to get champs for myself, skins for the girlfriend and IP/EXP boosts, I certainly don't feel like a valued customer...\n\nWill happily admit I'm not perfect, but I don't think I deserve another 85 games.","replies":[{"poster":"Super Euro Flash","date":"2015-04-11T13:58:25.211+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The problem is that your system is automated. I got reproted for verbal abuse that game, and I didn't say anything remotely abusive. This has obviously happened enough to trigger your system. They're salty that I crushed them, so they report me for whatever they can because I laugh in their face as their smack-talk.","replies":[{"poster":"Yazo","date":"2015-04-25T14:31:30.528+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I actually agree , salt isn't verbal abuse its just boasting . If you saying they are bad or something that isn't abusive . But calling them \"retarded\" or a \"Fuck tard\" is . Trash talk isn't abusive thats how sport is , havent they watched foot ball before they trash talk like shit but nothing happens , Bloody hell LCS and MLG's do it all the time ffs have you seen double lift , that guy shit talks everyone even his support . I agree with you man","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Super Euro Flash","date":"2015-04-14T03:52:56.382+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Filing a refund at the bank today for all of it, fuck you and fuck your lack of customer service.","replies":[{"poster":"HORSE OF FORCE","date":"2015-04-14T09:14:08.236+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Did you get it back?","replies":[{"poster":"Super Euro Flash","date":"2015-04-15T01:40:59.594+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Bank says 7 days and that I will get the lot.","replies":[{"poster":"HORSE OF FORCE","date":"2015-04-15T12:26:38.126+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Wow, nice job on that.
