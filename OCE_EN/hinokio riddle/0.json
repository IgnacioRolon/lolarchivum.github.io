As such, you’ll want to direct this to Riot Games Player Support by [**submitting a ticket**](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us)! As you submit your request, here are some tips that will help resolve this issue as quickly as possible: \n\n1. Be sure to submit as much information in your initial ticket as possible. For obvious reasons, each Player Support Specialist's request for more information will delay the resolution of the issue.\n2. Be respectful and polite in your correspondences with Riot Support. (They're doing their best to help you!)\n3. Try not create a new ticket or respond to an existing ticket before a Player Support Specialist has had the chance to review your request. New tickets/replies may bump your ticket back to the bottom of the queue, thus increasing the amount of time before a Player Support Specialist is able to review your ticket.  \n\n**If you're unsure where to put your ticket in, just select:**\n[*I have a question about League of Legends/Riot Games.*] > [*Game and Features*] > [*General Questions*]\n\nWith that being said, good luck!","replies":[{"poster":"Hinokio Riddle","date":"2015-12-23T04:33:45.492+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thx alot for this and ill need the luck also last thing i want to say it that i know what I have done and i prob do deserve the ban but i just want to say that Im very sorry to all the trouble i have caused i understand and from the bottom of my heart im sorry and would like to thank leauge of legend for the entertaiment for the last 2 years its been unforgattable and to all the friends i have met through it and i know the last few month have been diffcult for me family problems and turned that anger into leauge of legend chat I understand and if i had one more chance it would be really nice of you :) I will improve and i am really sorry for what i have done in the past anways peace","replies":[{"poster":"Wuks","date":"2015-12-23T06:28:28.454+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"It's not my decision to make, but good luck regardless.
