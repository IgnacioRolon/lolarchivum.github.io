The few examples you chose are only the most minor of the stupid shit that occurs during that opening 90 seconds and tbh, you are risking a bare minimum of 20 mins worth of you're precious time and enjoyment based completely around what could be (and has been) a group of floating turds, hell bent on blowing their shitty day into everyone else.\n\nWhy should I dodge and burn 5 mins of my life? Why should I lose LP because some jackass forces me to? I am actually shocked this isn't implemented already. You start a game and there it is, all the visible signs you're about to start digging in the pistol drawer and end it all, but guess what, you and 3 other people can be spared this unfair sabotage by immediately resetting the queue!\n\nEasy.","replies":[]},{"poster":"JasonWazza","date":"2016-04-12T09:23:51.557+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Take the game and report the person after, they will get banned as that is a bannable offense.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Wohltat","date":"2016-04-12T12:03:19.322+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Rivealon,realm=OCE,application-id=hIjvqaz6,discussion-id=xPErhEhg,comment-id=,timestamp=2016-04-12T08:22:00.923+0000)\n>\n> Another person Q-dodging.

It 5 min Penalty, -5lp and no MMR loss vs. 20 minutes Minium waste of time, -20 lp, -20 MMR and worse teammates in next game due to worse MMR.","replies":[{"poster":"ThatAsheDoe","date":"2016-04-22T05:23:07.611+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"bruh the whole concept is that you should be able to dodge a game if you and your team mates agree that someone's gonna mess things up without a penalty. he's comparing this idea to the 5 minute queue ban and the loss of a small amount of LP. not to the 20 minutes of game time and loss of LP that comes with losing the game.","replies":[]}]}]}
