Zeds q has to hit the champion first for the max dmg otherwise if it hits a minion then champion its useless xD, Zeds ult can be easily countered with a Zhonyas (i think i spelt it right ahah) or even a qss which i have been seeing lately. It also comes down to if you know how zed works and how you like to play against one. \n\nLeblanc on the other hand, if you allow her to roam early and not ping MIA or you team has no map awareness then she is likely just going to snipe a kill and then snowball, but if you are laning against one and find that you are taking more dmg then you should be, then reconsider how you are playing, Leblanc is a point blank range champion and you should try and stay back and hit skillshots if you have one. I do the same thing when i play zed against a lebanc, i just sit back and farm with q and poke with w and e and wait for her to be low enough for a ult opportunity. \n\nBoth champions are fairly balanced as they are meant to be assasins, where their combo should one shot you as thats what assasins do. Its how you want to counterplay it. If you want to stay in melee range of leblanc then do it but be aware that she will combo you, if you want to engage a zed then do it but be aware he has 2 shadows he can use to move to and they also copy his abilties.\n\nMy comment is done ahah remember im not being salty just stating what i think and what riot has said about these champs","replies":[{"poster":"Servant Rider","date":"2016-02-04T04:12:04.566+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Your right I should just farm from afar as Akali with all the skill Sho.... Oh wait she dosent have any. I think the point your missing here is that both Lb and Zed are champions atm are basically champions you have to counter pick agains in order to fight them. Akali for instance, should lose this fight every time if both players are equally skilled simply cause her early game is so weak and getting an hour glass first (3300 gold) means you do no damage and getting a QSS first agains Zed is just as stupid as it builds only from MR. Riot has said in the past that they don't want to make champions like X beats Y while Y beats Z and Z beats X but that is basically what Zed and Lb are at the moment. Either you counter pick and win or just die and yes I know skill levels play a part but this is assuming match making was useful and people actually versed people of similar skill/rank","replies":[{"poster":"Gragozz","date":"2016-02-04T04:33:19.572+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"do i recall saying you needed those items first? ahaha i dont think so, and you didnt mention anything bout akali so i assumed you were playing any champ not one in particluar, i still believe it how you play against them aswell if you want to play akali against a zed then you have no choice to let him control early game but late you mid to alte you should be fine as he can have a hard time doing dmg to you if he ults and you use your w and sit on the edge, \n\ni want to play with you somtime btw if you wouldnt mind not cause i think you need help or whatever but i think you know what you are talking about and as you said in a different comment its oce, we dont have the brightest people playing ahha","replies":[{"poster":"Servant Rider","date":"2016-02-04T05:24:51.935+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"See the contradiction there.

Lb now will simply AA, then Q W you and unless you are counter picking odds are your playing a champ that cant do much.\n\nBy the time late game comes around, multiple members of your team should have items which make it stupidly difficult for either of them to do enough damage to your carries. As a carry, once you get a QSS you'll be fine against Zed unless he's either really fed or you play poorly. As an AP Champion you'll have Zhonya's and probably Rylai's (and maybe more) so there's no chance he's killing you unless you let him. As everyone else you should be tanky enough that you don't need to worry about him touching you.\n\nSame goes for LeBlanc. There's Zhonya's, QSS, Sterak's, Maw, Banshee's, Bloodthirster, etc. Your team should also have at least 1 Locket and maybe a Crucible and Face of the Mountain. If you have to solo LeBlanc or Zed because your team either doesn't help or they're just useless, they're still beatable with Flash as long as you don't walk back into them afterwards. You can dodge every bit of their damage except Ignite, LB Q/R, Zed R and basic attacks. \n\nAs for your point about no risk, they have plenty early. In lower levels of play they'll usually use their escape to harass or farm, which makes them easily gankable. Capitalise on any mistake you can and snowball from that. If you don't trust yourself to do that then just play safe and farm so they can't snowball off you. Once they're fed and you're alone then you're probably screwed and it's difficult to win that but it's not impossible.","replies":[{"poster":"Servant Rider","date":"2016-02-04T03:15:49.611+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"A lot of what you said above requires your team to have a brain, and lets we are Oce, the odds of getting a team that even understands what team work is is slim to none.
