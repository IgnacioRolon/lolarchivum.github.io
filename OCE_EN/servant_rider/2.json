It gets rid of it. Maybe instead of just calling people stupid you could actually give then an idea of something they could do that wouldn't have been stupid.\n\n> when i try to be polite about it\n\nWait, I thought you said there was no nice way to say it?","replies":[{"poster":"Servant Rider","date":"2015-12-07T09:22:48.385+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":3,"body":"1.

I have tried that, usually after someone gives FB only for them to completely ignore any advice i tried to give and walking imminently back to lane to try to 1v1 the guy that just kicked their ass\n\n3. There is no nice way to call someone stupid, cause stupid is used as an insult. Saying something like \"if you had done this you would have won\" is different then doing something like \" WTF, are you stupid, why did you just try to 3v1\"","replies":[{"poster":"Project Xayah","date":"2015-12-07T09:43:50.234+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"> Ok please provide me a nice way to call someone stupid.\n\nI'm going to quote you here:\n\n> \"if you had done this you would have won\"\n\nNotice how there's no insults there?

Sure, some people are stupid by choice but I have no doubt that there are plenty of people who **HAVE** taken your advice, even if it wasn't in the game you played with them.","replies":[{"poster":"GigaPube","date":"2015-12-08T12:47:28.980+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"who the fuck has time to be nice. either way 90% of the time they'll be feeding, your opponent is farming and wont end and nobody wants to surrender because they feel like they're learning or some shit. in the end you're wasting up to and over an entire amount of another games minutes worth of time having to calmly tell these retards not to duel %%%%s that are fed or whatever cos its just making it worse.\n\noh but it doesnt stop there, no, they're a jax, they've got guinsoos, they think they've got late game, so no surrenderino here m8, nope. just sit on your ass as a soraka and do absolutely fuck all cos you cant even heal someone twice before they get blown up. 20-40 minutes of running around pretending to ward and care about your team but you already know the game is lost at 3-25 kills\n\nand whats the point of all of this if they dont even take any of your kind and assertive criticism, nay, advice. you all just wasted up to 40 minutes watching the enemies farm and stall the game while your belligerent teammates are still too egotistical to surrender cos they cant tell the enemies are just fucking around laughing at their screens watching these kids walk 1 by 1 into a 3 second fight after finally completing their 1st item thinking they're strong af when in actuality, the AD darius with furor greaves, cleaver and IE can 1v5 the entire enemy team\n\nTLDR dont read that its just me butthurt and ranting","replies":[]},{"poster":"Servant Rider","date":"2015-12-08T00:49:29.719+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Maybe they did take my advice after the game but what good is that to me?\n\n Let's use a pretty common example here, with someone who is new to GP and is having trouble landing his barrels, something I've seen a lot. So you tell them to place it in the bush first, let it tick down and then drop one on the opponent and then detonating the first so they can't dodge. \n\nWhen I tried to give simple advice like that to people who are clearly new to the champ I was either told to fuck off or just ignored. \n\nThe one time someone listened to me on any advice was when he wanted tips on playing Akali cause I rekt him in a game as her. \n\nI don't expect all advice to be followed, I don't have such a stupid expectation but If they are struggling to use a champion and some fairly simple advice is given like the GP example it would at the very least be nice to see them try, instead of just doing the same thing over and over. The only reason I care is cause I mainly played rank so I would rather not lose cause someone picks a champion they have no idea how to play and doesn't communicate with the team when help is given","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"sad little benju","date":"2015-12-07T15:58:41.199+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Unlucky with the perma ban.
