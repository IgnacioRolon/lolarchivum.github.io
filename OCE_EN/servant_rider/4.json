As soon as someone unfairly criticises you, mute them, and try to forget what they said. If you are the jungler and a top laner is not taking your advice and charging in like a retard and feeding more, avoid their lane. Don't gank them anymore. Focus on the other lanes, because retards are a lost cause.","replies":[{"poster":"Servant Rider","date":"2016-01-13T10:04:17.932+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"What I don't get is how some of these people get to gold or higher and manage to keep them self at that level","replies":[{"poster":"Bookbash","date":"2016-01-17T00:05:09.979+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Servant Rider,realm=OCE,application-id=Ntey9fRZ,discussion-id=qRPyVwXZ,comment-id=0000000000000000,timestamp=2016-01-13T10:04:17.932+0000)\n>\n> What I don't get is how some of these people get to gold or higher and manage to keep them self at that level\n\nIt's because theres really not much difference between bronze-gold.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Eliea","date":"2016-01-09T16:34:53.371+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I generally just ignore people like that. Sure it annoys me, but I just think instead of me yelling at them (Making them feel worse, or making think they won) I just play the game as I would normally, try and do well for the position I am in, if they are persistent I just report them at the end of the game.\n\nSometimes people could just be having a bad game, if you can see they are trying, but still not getting anywhere, give them a bit of assistance, even verbal assistance helps. 'That was close Syndra, better luck next time!' And if they get something good, 'Good job Syndra, Now we can get an objective' It makes them feel better about them selves, and will also help them to try and play better for your team.","replies":[{"poster":"Servant Rider","date":"2016-01-11T09:44:10.259+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"I get that people can have bad games but that is no reason to continue to make the same mistake over and over.\n The last game I got on this account had a lee sin mirror match in the top lane.

Unfortunately, its inevitable human error is part of life. The guys I really like playing with tend not to get angry with me, because they know I get really annoyed when I make mistakes and I'm probably beating myself up already. When I know those playing with me are trying to help, I actually play better. Perhaps you can try to channel the frustration in to encouragement and support and you may find those around you actually improve. \n\nConquisitor","replies":[{"poster":"Servant Rider","date":"2016-01-11T05:43:00.379+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Wow didn't think a Rioter would comment on this.\n\nMy problem isn't that people make mistakes but that they never learn or they just keep repeating the same mistakes over and over. An example of this is the final game I got to play on this account had a lee sin mirror match in the top lane. The lee sin on my team looked up the opponents rank and found he was plat and him being only 28 said he would sit under tower. He then gave up FB but that didn't bother me that much as i could accept something like that. The problem i had was that as soon as he got back to top lane he tried to fight the opponent again and lose again. I ganked him and gave him a hand and yet 2 min later he already gave him another kill and then another. The thing that makes me even more furious about this that that I was matched with a fucking lvl 28 when I'm gold. I thought matching making would only pair you with people of equal or 1 tier higher or lower, not some new guy who is still wet behind the ears.\n\n Also this may be a little off topic but I heard somewhere, forget where, that it's possible to get a banned account back, can you confirm this for me if possible?","replies":[{"poster":"Conquisitor","date":"2016-01-12T02:50:06.942+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"I had a look at your games where you seem to be getting frustrated at others. The thing that I've noticed is that when you get annoyed with a team mate's performance you often take it all the way to verbal abuse, which is why you've been banned before.\nBeing negative towards others is not the best method to helping them improve. Everyone has the same chance of being in a team where someone is doing poorly, the way you deal with it is determined by you.\n\nI would stop using chat as a means to express frustration. Sure, give advice if it feels like it will help, it can be beneficial as I've learned from others' advice in game, but as soon as that turns to negativity and abuse it will only harm your team's chance of victory.\n\nPermabans from instant feedback system are irreversible. When you get banned you have visibility of the chat logs which show you why you were banned. If you haven't had a look at them yourself, I recommend you do so.","replies":[{"poster":"Servant Rider","date":"2016-01-12T04:57:52.234+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"I've seen taken a look at the chat logs that were sent to me every time I've been chat restricted or banned and in all honesty i find them kind of useless mainly cause all they show me is what I said, not the whole conversation. While i get sending someone the entire chat log of a 40 min plus game is just stupid to except, I find having a single complete paragraph of clearly define Verbal Abuse would be much more beneficial to someone then only the things they said in the game cause I doubt most people clearly remember what they say at every second of the game, exceptionally cause I've wondered sometimes what counts as simply being frustrated at someone and when it reaches Verbal abuse, exceptionally since no one has ever given me a clear answer to it and I've been reported for verbal abuse for something as simple as swearing at them, even if what I said wasn't overly negative.\n\nWould it be possible for Riot to add a toggle like the langue filter so that they can can either just shut them self off  from the chat so they cant reply or just chat restrict them self, cause a lot of what I say is in the heat of the moment, cause a problem I've always had is getting into a game and getting angry when people cant play to a level that I expect them to (problem would have helped if being good at this game isn't the only thing i got going for me so its about the only thing i take any pride in doing well in). \n\nFigured as much about the permaban      \n\nThanks for taking the time to reply to this.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}
