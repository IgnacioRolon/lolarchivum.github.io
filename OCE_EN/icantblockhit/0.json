I'd probably go for at least a 500W PSU (he has a 430 in the picture but lists a 500 in the list) as well because cutting it close can hurt you if you don't have the cleanest power. \n\nParticularly for gaming, get an SSD. Even if it's only big enough to hold your OS and your core games and you have a HDD for everything else, get an SSD. The difference in UX is vast and a 256 or 460GB isn't that expensive anymore.\n\nThe forums on PC Parts Picker are a good resource for advice, as well as the site itself letting you 'build' your PC in a list to make sure that everything is compatible (and then link that build in the forums as well), and depending on the parts compare prices. (it shows Australian stores like PCCaseGear as well)\n\nThe building itself isn't that hard, triangle peg goes in triangle hole type stuff for the most part (though tutorials are always advised) so long as all your parts (including your case) fit, though I've never overclocked myself so can't comment on that.\n\nIf you're on a tight budget, look for second-hand parts. Lotta people who upgrade (particularly GPUs) and then sell the old (and often not even all that outdated) on Gumtree or the like.","replies":[{"poster":"iCantBlockHit","date":"2019-10-10T14:12:39.534+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I was already getting a 500W PSU, but I was wondering about getting an SSD tho, seems like a good idea, anyway thanks for the help &lt;3","replies":[{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2019-10-10T14:17:36.333+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Put it this way, my League is on an SSD, my partner for the longest time had it on a HDD.
