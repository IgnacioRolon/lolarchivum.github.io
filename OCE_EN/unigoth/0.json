I&#039;ve somehow made it to level 15, and discoverd Poppy and can play well as her but only in Jungle... I was doing ok with Akali until I started encountering people in the intermediate COOP vs AI games and normal blind pick PVP games... Suffice it to say I no longer play in the intermediate range or PVP games due to the negativity... so if anyone has any tips they could share with me as I know almost nothing about league that would be awesome and I would totally be in your debt.... Thanks in advance...","replies":[{"poster":"dominion24","date":"2016-03-21T03:51:44.818+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I have only just reached lvl 30 , and realised even then you have so much still to learn.  If you want to add me I would be happy to play some games with you.  Even some custom games with other people are a good way to get a feel for a champion and learn the mechanics before trying PVP.  Just don't wait until lvl 30 before playing PVP, better to start now","replies":[]},{"poster":"andyMak","date":"2016-03-18T02:12:26.383+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"hi there\nWelcome to league,\n\nI would recommend PVP\nI started in bots and i found i got to lvl 30 and wanted to do pvp. i was not ready as i lvled trhough coop bots and pvp is completely different\n\nWhen playing pvp i 1) turn all chat off, the enemy team has nothing i need to hear and all chat is usually just used to complain about someone \n2) as soon as i smell toxicity in the air i mute that player\n\nI know its harder but you get to learn alot from it :)\n","replies":[]},{"poster":"Ingénue","date":"2016-03-18T01:05:34.597+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hi, welcome to League :)\n\nI was once where you are, stuck playing beginner bots because Intermediate was too hard and PVP too toxic (everyone expects everyone to be a smurf). I expect intermediate bots to be even harder now due to there being more bots than when I was new (back in mid S4). \n\nPoppy is a super fun champion, one of my favourites at the moment! Check out some of her builds [here](http://probuilds.net) and [here. ](http://www.mobafire.com/league-of-legends/champion/poppy-43)\n\nIt is probably a good idea to get a feel for some of the other roles while you are still low level, because as soon as you hit lvl 30 people except you to be able to do everything (haha I still can't jungle 2 years on). [Lolclass ](http://www.lolclass.com/videos) is a really good site for this, as it gives you a basic rundown of the champs strengths and weaknesses. \n\nIn terms of the negative behaviour you have been experiencing in games, you can do your part to minimise this by reporting players in the post game screen (the little red exclamation point beside their name). Make sure to include details of why they are toxic in the report comment box as well. \n\nIn terms of dealing with toxic players on game, the best thing is to ignore them. Even if they are trying to rip you to shreds, just ignore them. You can mute players in game by pushing tab and clicking on the little speakerphone near their name. You don't really need to talk to them after all, you can just ping.\n\nIf you would like, you can add my other account (_hailikecookie_) ingame and I can play with you :D\n\nGood luck, have fun ♥","replies":[]},{"poster":"Icarus1314","date":"2016-03-18T00:41:26.659+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Poppy jungle...

Ive been playing PVP lately, and seem to have gotten better, but not quite there yet. Still need practice, but basically too hard to find people to play with... too many accounts that have scripts running and makes it too easy so never really know if I am getting better or just playing against a script these days :-( sadly wish it was different... I've finally reached level 21 amd don't think i will ever reach lvl 30 at the rate I am going","replies":[]}]}
