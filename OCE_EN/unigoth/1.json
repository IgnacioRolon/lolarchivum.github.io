I just get flamed and then stop playing because it's no longer fun... I'm looking for chill people to play with who are ok with the fact that I'm not ranked and still basically learning to play the game and won't flame me for every little mistake... maybe I'm asking for too much idk but thought I would try posting and seein if anyone was interested in makin new friends n juss playin some relaxed chill norms. I also have discord if that's desired by people.... \r\n\r\nIGN: Unigoth\r\nServer: OCE","replies":[{"poster":"Exarch Leona","date":"2019-11-20T15:24:14.441+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You had me at support main &lt;3\nFeel free to add me and play with.
