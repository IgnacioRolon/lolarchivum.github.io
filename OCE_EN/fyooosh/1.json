He was sure of it. Visually, it was the same &ndash; the bleak, darkened landscape, bereft of warmth. The familiar mist, seemingly endless and capable of swallowing what little light remained in this desolate place. \r\nThe fog coiled around a flickering lantern, sucking the life from the flame. He reached desperately towards it, and in doing so caught sight of his arm. As the light guttered and died, he beheld the wicked blades protruding from his forearm &ndash; and he screamed in abject horror. \r\n\r\nThis isn&rsquo;t right!\r\n\r\nHis heart threatened to beat out of his chest, and he struggled to regain control. Fragments of his memory were beginning to flood back. It was not the dark that disconcerted him; he was of the night, a creature mired in the abyss. Nor did his cruel, weapon-like body give him cause for lasting concern, for he remembered who he was. Though, this brought him no solace, only sorrow.\r\n\r\nA hooded figure stood, beckoning. As he warily approached, whispers began to reverberate within his mind. They spoke of unspeakable acts, chilling and terrifying, perpetrated by a ruthless fiend. Countless lives taken &ndash; man, woman and child, the young and the elderly &ndash; it mattered not. More than a million souls sent screaming to the void. And all, the whispers told him, by your hand. Fresh waves of guilt ripped through him. He knew he could never atone, even if he spent a thousand lifetimes trying to make it right. A thousand lifetimes, fettered in service to the League. A demented laugh choked its way past his lips, betraying his bitterness. The League! How could one such as he hope to be granted forgiveness when his &lsquo;atonement&rsquo; comprised murder and savage killing &ndash; the very deeds for which he was damned? Over and over he slaughtered in the name of the League, the tally ever growing. Despair rose anew within his breast. \r\n\r\nHe stood now before the cloaked man. Deep within the cowl, a gleam of teeth indicated a cruel grin. He spoke; his voice like a jagged blade across bone, and proclaimed:\r\n\r\n&ldquo;Cursed Revenant.&rdquo;\r\n\r\nThe tone was mocking, and he fell away from it. He was suddenly aware of the enormous weight he carried. Though he could not see it, he knew what it must be. He could feel it. The smothering, writhing mass of souls. The embodiment of his guilt, a lifetime of transgressions, entombed within a stone coffin, affixed to his back &ndash; a permanent reminder. \r\n\r\nThe mist closed in. He slashed at it, unnerved and desperate, as if fighting for his very life. He heard laughter echoing, harsh and taunting. He wheeled, eyes searching for a physical target. The hooded man had vanished, and the light was fading fast. \r\nThis isn&rsquo;t how it&rsquo;s supposed to be! He railed, furious, umbra blades flashing viciously. They found no mark, and his energy waned. At last, he sank within the mists. This wasn&rsquo;t how it was supposed to end, he mourned silently. He had been a good man, once. Then he had lost his way, somewhere between then and now, but he&rsquo;d always held out hope that he could rebalance the scales. That for all his sins, he could make it right and bring his own soul out of the darkness. Once again he felt the crushing weight across his shoulders; despair and rage sought to overtake him &ndash; as the mists slowly closed in around him. Dragging him down, his fate forever sealed within the shadows.\r\n\r\nFinally, he knew. The unshakeable feeling that something was wrong &ndash; he reminded himself of who he was. _He_ was of the night, the one who brought terror. _He_ it was who drowned his prey in paranoia, brought nocturnal visions of a person&rsquo;s greatest horror &ndash; and it was he who then feasted upon his victim, in their last moments of overwhelming panic. He revelled in it. \r\nTo say he felt no guilt, no sorrow, was wrong. He truly carried those feelings with him, the burden akin to the coffin across his back. The shackles binding his tortured heart were as heavy and cumbersome as those that literally bound his victims to him. However, as the darkness claimed him, he knew what disturbed him. It was the reversal of roles. It was something he had never considered, for it was inconceivable to him that he should be subjected to that which he enacted upon others. Cold fury welled from deep in his core, bursting forth from his body and igniting into incandescent flames of rage. The shadows shrank away, cowed by his renewed vigour. Pale ember orbs glared into the gloom, and found the hooded figure. His adversary&rsquo;s face, now visible against his own blazing countenance, was transfixed in shock, and he attempted to retreat with the mist. \r\n\r\nAll doubt within him was now banished. Absolute mastery of his world returned to him, and the fleeing man screamed. Panicked, his head snapped this way and that as he searched harrowingly for the way out; the way to sever his link to this unconscious realm. The shadows, only moments ago his own tool of torment, now hindered him. His heart sank as his vision grew dim and the chilling mists poured over him. He desperately squeezed his eyes shut. There was no escape. The last vestiges of hope were snuffed out as he heard a terrifying murmur in his ears&hellip;\r\n\r\n&ldquo;Wrong, summoner; _I_ am _your_ nightmare.&rdquo; And the shroud fell upon him.","replies":[{"poster":"Fyooosh","date":"2017-03-30T14:14:25.563+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Reeeally hope I didn't post this too late!","replies":[]}]}
