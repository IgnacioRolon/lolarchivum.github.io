This happens everytime i open Paladins.\nWith this information I think the issue is with my computer not League and Paladins.\nIf you need any other information let me know.\n\n**Hope you can help!**\nThanks in advance :D","replies":[{"poster":"Lika SunRyze","date":"2016-08-13T10:17:18.363+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I have posted more information on my issue, please have a look and see if that helps to solve the issue.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Lika SunRyze","date":"2016-08-09T23:12:19.457+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Sadly the repair didnt solve the properly.\nI re","replies":[{"poster":"Kürama","date":"2016-08-09T23:24:22.088+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Rid yourself of the pests which harass your gameplay by using the [Bug & Crash Exterminator.](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201761974-Bug-Splat-and-Game-Crashes) Kha’Zix and Elise won’t know what hit ‘em.\n\nhttp://na.leagueoflegends.com/sites/default/files/styles/scale_xlarge/public/upload/khazix_deathblossom_splash_1920x1080.jpg?itok=re5tY9ln https://static.lolwallpapers.net/2014/12/Death-Blossom-Elise.jpg","replies":[{"poster":"Lika SunRyze","date":"2016-08-13T10:11:39.580+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Rineyy,realm=NA,application-id=ElA0rvVL,discussion-id=RZEALEAr,comment-id=00010000,timestamp=2016-08-09T23:24:22.088+0000)\n>\n> Rid yourself of the pests which harass your gameplay by using the [Bug &amp; Crash Exterminator.](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201761974-Bug-Splat-and-Game-Crashes) Kha’Zix and Elise won’t know what hit ‘em.\n> \n> http://na.leagueoflegends.com/sites/default/files/styles/scale_xlarge/public/upload/khazix_deathblossom_splash_1920x1080.jpg?itok=re5tY9ln https://static.lolwallpapers.net/2014/12/Death-Blossom-Elise.jpg\n\nSadly nothing there worked, however i  have added new information about my issue if you want to take a look.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Kürama","date":"2016-08-09T21:35:01.135+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"A repair should solve the bug splats.
