If the build depends no the situation (i think so) which build is best for which situation.\r\n\r\nI am currently using the standard Morello in ludnes then void, abyssal, zhonyas or deathcap build. The other options i have seen are abyssal into deathcap, morello into protobelt, morello into abyssal then into void. If you have seen or know of other viable builds let me know.\r\n\r\nI want to know, out of these build and/or your own if you know of any, which build is suitable for which situation, for example: Morello into Protobelt is best when the enemy is spreadout so that you can get up close to someone and nuke them without being in danger of being in the middle of a big fight. Also this build is a late game build and the main powerspikes are when you buy the revolver or when you complete the core items.\r\n\r\nTo make it easier to understand (repeating more clearly): can you please tell me which build is good for which situation, what it power spikes are and if its ealier, mid or late game.","replies":[{"poster":"Ace","date":"2016-08-30T09:01:29.822+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey man if you're looking for info about Ahri I recommend watching Vertigal, He's an EUW Ahri main take a look at some of his videos they're great! https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC5k92yN-iTikpFrJTU9LIpQ","replies":[]},{"poster":"Hideousbeast","date":"2016-08-30T08:33:53.430+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"http://www.mobafire.com/league-of-legends/ahri-guide\n\nAlways the best place to start looking at builds.
