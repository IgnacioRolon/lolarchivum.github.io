YES he gets a free item at the start of the game that gives 3AP/LVL... this however is not very OP.... as consider this.... HE ONLY HAS 5 ITEM SLOTS NOT 6.... that means no matter what happens he is always down a slot.... Admittedly the new hexcore is a lot better then the old days pre rework and is now not a complete waste... but it does limit his item choices... ALSO to note is that this is his PASSIVE.... so he misses out on that too\n\nSecondly the upgrades cost 1000 for the upgrade of 20AP, 150Mana and 1AP/lvl increase.... for 860 you can have 40AP.... that means his scale is lower... but with this he does get to augment an ability.... depending on how he goes changes the ability... but he is very reliant on these changes.\n\nNow about the Deathray being OP... it is very hard to hit at long ranges, quite easily dodged with some MS and the secondary burst from the augment is not instant... Just because you can't dodge a skillshot does not make it OP its a targeted line that is a very hard mechanic to master.... it also has a LONG CD especially in team flgihts and you cant spam it as it COSTS A LOT OF MANA.....\n\nbut hey as you said he gets an instant shield with his power transfer.... Power transfer shield is only up for 2.5 seconds but its actually not the transfer that does the damage its the mele afterwards..... DONT LET HIM MELE YOU AND HE WOULD HAVE DONE vEry LITtlE DAMAGE.....\nsecondly to that it is very short range!!!!! like in your face short range for a caster and puts him in a very bad position a lot of the time........\n\nNow for his area stun gravity well.... Did you know you can counter it with banshee vale, quicksilver sash or by simply playing Mr Yi... thats right the well doesnt effect Mr Yi at all...... It needs to slow to stun... and you can only be stunned once... the slow does not proc ur banshee only the stun does meaning you dont get stunned...... now put onto that a smallish range and the fact it takes 3 stacks of slow at .5 seconds you get about 1-1.5 seconds to react and move out, hop out or flash out... This skill is on a VERY LONG COOLDOWN 13 seconds at lvl 5.....\nBait it out and he is useless vs gangs......\n\nFinally you complained about his ult.... Now lets just say that its NOT a silence any more!!! that was prior to change.... it now only interupts channeling abilities.... theres a huge difference!... It does OK damage intiially but is more based on its DOT.... Stay with it and well you can expect to get stuffed... but hey its DOT and its slower the further you are from viktor so abuse that and its useless.....\n\n\nIn Conclusion VIKTOR is not OP... he is a highskill champion that when used correctly and especially if fed is quite potent... do a little reasearch on him and he is well a glass cannon that is gonna die cos everything is on CD a LOT!....","replies":[]},{"poster":"DiabolicEsper","date":"2015-01-19T04:42:46.630+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Why nerf him if no one plays him?\nalso it takes alot of skill to be OP with him too.","replies":[]}]}
