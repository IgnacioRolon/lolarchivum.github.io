Decent early game, only really rough against Caitlyn. \r\n2. Strong mid game (can out burst almost any ADC 1v1, Q + R is just so strong, this is provided you haven't fell behind 15 cs, if you have you can still get a kill but need a hard cc support such as Blitz/Leona to help you)\r\n3. A passive which endlessly scales into the late game\r\n4. Great waveclear with q (also R if it is absolutely crucial)\r\n5. Graves r is easy to land on a lot of people, it deals tonnes of damage,  and there is even some extra range of burst damage at the end (allows you to snipe runners) \r\n6. Has a dash which gives you a pretty decent **as **steroid for an early/mid game champion. \r\n7. At full build he can 100-0 most ADCs/APCs 1v1 with his q/r burst along with e **as** steroid. (exception may be a vayne who gets a good condemn off, or a trist which escapes instantly, please note if you get lucky crits and have used your e steroid + q and r, you may be able to kill them almost instantly)\r\n8. aoe w smoke screen to disturb their frontline and allow for your team to get free shots off on them, as if they are a blind old man without his walking stick. \r\n\r\nCons:\r\nSlightly shorter range\r\nOnce behind 30 cs or so, it is hard to come back if your support cannot initiate on their ADC, especially if thy are playing a ranged/mobile one like Trist/Cait/Kalista. \r\nUsing e to deal more damage (can put you in a very dangerous position)\r\nMana costs are a bit of an issue, but easily solved with one mana pot per back.","replies":[{"poster":"WEETBIX 4 BREKKI","date":"2015-01-19T13:47:55.144+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"1. his pre-6 is actually nowhere near as good as other adcs\n2. yes his mid game is strong, that's his power spike\n3. his passive makes only a very small difference\n4. nearly every adc has good wave clear\n5. most ults are very easy to land\n6. his dash is decent at best\n7. no he cant\n8.
