If you still aren't seeing it I recommend reaching out to [Player Support](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/requests/new).\n\nI actually recommend you reach out to PS in any case as it appears you've crafted the ward skin twice. The first time it redeemed to your account and the second time you just crafted it as a \"ward skin permanent\" that you should see sitting in your Hextech Inventory. It's possible that PS may return the tokens you used to redeem the ward a second time if you explain the mistake as long as you don't disenchant the item in your inventory.","replies":[]}]}
