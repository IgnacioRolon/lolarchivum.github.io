However, so far this month I have had to delete the air-client 3 times and reinstall the updates (Note: it is only the 12th) due to the client producing a black screen when transitioning into champ-select. I have tried restarting my router, the client and my computer numerous times on each occasion. This has also previously happened and I had to uninstall completely and reinstall; also taking into account awful Australian internet so it requires about 2-3 hours for an air-client update vs. a 5-6 hour download to completely reinstall. \r\n\r\nWhy does this happen? Is there an easier alternative? Or am I just extremely unlucky?\r\n\r\nI have sunk a fair chunk of money into this game and I sure as hell don&#039;t want to quit as it is a fun as hell game with or without friends for fun and also competitively. \r\n\r\nJust please fix this RIOT or other suggestions are absolutely more than welcome.","replies":[]}
