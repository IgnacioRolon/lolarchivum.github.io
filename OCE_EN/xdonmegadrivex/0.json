Finding it difficult with so many trolls and AFK people these days, so hopefully with a solid duo partner we can escape Elo hell together. Keen to play most evening and weekends.  Suit any lane. Wanting to get serious. \r\n\r\nOr if anyone needs a solid member for a team contact me, currently I am in a low division but test me out. \r\n\r\nCheers and cya on the rift!","replies":[{"poster":"DiamondHD2000","date":"2015-11-23T23:42:12.342+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yeah chuck me an friend request, DiamondHD2000, i was stuck between bronze 1-3 after i dropped out of silver after my promos, but now i pushed back to silver, ill see how you play maybe we could duo! :) depends on your attitude too.
