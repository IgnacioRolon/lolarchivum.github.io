You could also make assists give you a half stack (or kills = 2 stacks, assists = 1 stacks) and you would lose half of them every time you die (just like with Cho&#039;Gath&#039;s ult).\r\nThis concept could even further be tuned to make the champ&#039;s ultimate consume all of your current stacks for one high powered attack (could maybe only lose half if it kills). This would leave the player with having to choose between saving the stacks to keep their lesser abilities powered up, or consuming them in one gigantic attack for a sure kill.\r\n\r\nThoughts?","replies":[{"poster":"Urgot Bot","date":"2015-05-01T06:30:51.915+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":1,"body":"Very high reward, very high risk? You do realise you are asking for a champ with a sword of the occult/mejais built into their kit, so if they built either of these items they would likely be very powerful.","replies":[{"poster":"Cloudy342","date":"2015-05-01T07:50:49.525+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"I think you explained that very well.\n\nThe rest of the champion's kit could possibly be reliant on the stacks in which that early game the champion would need a lot of support or ganks in order to not fall behind. Though if not, the champion would be able to succeed quite positively.\n\nOverall, my opinion on the idea is yes if some features were changed accordingly.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"kJs","date":"2015-05-03T12:17:45.419+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Rengar is a little bit like that.

Nasus can build damage stacks for one of his abilities yes, but I mean more like a passive ability which stacks damage for all of their abilities combined with an ult that consumes all of the stacks. This way you have to choose between having amped up regular abilities or sacrificing their strength for one giant nuke.","replies":[]}]}]}
