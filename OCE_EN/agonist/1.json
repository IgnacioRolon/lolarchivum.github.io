Why is there not a darker themed Lux skin? Jayce just got a Forsaken skin despite being a heroic figure, so where is Lux&#039;s? I&#039;m not saying her new skin looks bad, I&#039;m just saying it doesn&#039;t really make her seem overly different to her core character. Dark Necromancer Lux where?!\r\nBump if you agree =)","replies":[{"poster":"smasher66","date":"2015-05-09T01:36:41.462+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Most of Lux's skins are good but I have to agree, there too bright and heroic.
