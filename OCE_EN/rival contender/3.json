Some people were going to use clash as a way to catch up, we all shifted the a few things around to finally have something we can do together and have a laugh. Cancelling clash was probably the worst you guys could possibly do, i understand shit went wrong and that&#039;s fine but couldn&#039;t you speak with other regions about it working and try find a fault it that? Like you guys are a massive company and to just simply say &quot;sorry you gotta wait even longer now&quot; is an insult. I love league but this is making me hate it you really should have solved this better then just going &quot;It&#039;s broken, We canceling&quot; Very disappointed.","replies":[]}
