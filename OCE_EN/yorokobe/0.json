I don't know if we can change those level up messages to suit the state of actual queue availability in OCE, but I'll look into it at least.\n\nTwisted Treeline (TT) Bots is not available on OCE because often there would be so few players queuing up at the same time that finding a match could take way too long.\nIn regions where TT Bots its available, SR bots is tremendously more popular. We don't want to open up a TT Bot queue that would potentially have an infinite queue time.\nTT Bots is also used as the primary way to power-level and you see this sometimes in Summoner's Rift Bots on OCE already. This may mean that you could actually find a match in TT Bots on OCE relatively easily at certain times of the day, but it also defeats the purpose of a bots mode as new players wouldn't really get a chance to learn the mode because power-levellers are only interested in pushing a single lane to win as quickly as possible.","replies":[]}]}
