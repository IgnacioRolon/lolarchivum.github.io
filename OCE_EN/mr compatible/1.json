Because people aren&#039;t aware of the amount shields people use so its good to see how much healing is done by say, lulu, janna, vi, Tahm","replies":[{"poster":"spoodaman","date":"2015-10-13T13:31:52.147+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey there is a guy with a ford falcon number plate g1tgudscrb could you please come and retrieve it","replies":[]},{"poster":"Mr Compatible","date":"2015-10-13T12:58:13.461+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yea I don't think they will :/ Not popular enough","replies":[]},{"poster":"Danasko","date":"2015-07-22T13:05:37.373+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I totally agree with this idea.
