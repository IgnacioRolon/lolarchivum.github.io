Trying to get this out and will post it heeps until riot responds :D","subforum":"Gameplay & Strategy","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"I would like to have a CC (crowd control) meter put into the game so people can see what cc they have done and what people can improve on to realise how op cc is in the game (stuns, freeze, knock up, knock back, pulls) this is will very helpful as we can change around game play with this.\r\n\r\nAlso i would like to add in that riot should add shield absorbs to the healing done in the meters for after the game! Because people aren&#039;t aware of the amount shields people use so its good to see how much healing is done by say, lulu, janna, vi, Tahm","replies":[{"poster":"Azirious Mistake","date":"2015-10-14T00:41:43.337+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"we already have a fucking loss of control bar under our health bars, lets just leave it at that.","replies":[]},{"poster":"osamasnotdead","date":"2015-10-13T18:52:16.514+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It should be an option in the setting in bots!","replies":[]},{"poster":"GigaPube","date":"2015-10-13T16:55:06.197+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"that would be nice. probably as less likely to happen as a sandbox mode though","replies":[]}]}
