So, LeBlanc looks pretty good, so does Malzahar, I really like their move sets and feel that with practise i could become quite skilled with them, but i have a hunch that when i query my friends on these suggestion they will automatically activate their bias and their opinions on those champions and their favourite ones will just turn me off using them and they'll make it seem like my choices are just bland and stupid. I'd like to hear from some other sources, are these champions worth trying for a newcomer, and if not then what are some good mage/magical related champions you'd recommend for someone who's willing to spend money (a little) and time to learn them and their abilities well. Thanks in advance :D","replies":[{"poster":"Arikushika","date":"2015-03-09T11:57:53.867+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yes, mages are amazing at mid, got a fighter on the enemy team?

My friends that got me into it were like veterans (season 1 and 2). So they usually made it hard to really do much without criticism. But if you really want to get the most out of the game, play the way you want to play cause you will get better for it and feel better about it. Their input is good to gain knowledge but if you like a champ just go for it, you will decide whether or not it fits in with your play style on your own.","replies":[]},{"poster":"TrashDonnut","date":"2015-03-07T02:29:07.290+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Mages provide a lot of damage input, mostly they are tanky with HP.\n\neg.{{item:3151}} {{item:3116}} \n\nYeah, Mages are good for newcomers.","replies":[]},{"poster":"GoldenTomat0","date":"2015-03-07T00:45:26.825+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"play whoever you want to play.
