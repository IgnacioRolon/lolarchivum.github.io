I have only even left one game and that was months ago because I had to go out so I'm wondering what has happened and how i fix it? Any body else have this issue? Could it be because I leave custom games? I thought you could because there were not other human players.","replies":[{"poster":"Nova 6","date":"2015-02-13T23:28:44.315+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Same I left 1 game after 20+ games of not leaving and then i get low priority 20 mins","replies":[]},{"poster":"HORSE OF FORCE","date":"2015-02-06T06:44:45.784+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Do you disconnect from games because of lag?","replies":[]}]}
