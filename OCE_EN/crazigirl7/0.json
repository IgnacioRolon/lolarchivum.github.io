Additionally, skin combinations are best made one for each role so you can have a themed team, and so the jungle role is already covered with Hecarim (both Heca and Kha can be played outside of the jungle, but their most popular role is jungle).\n\nAlso, I feel like Final Boss Veigar is technically an arcade skin too, so really we're only missing a top lane arcade skin.\n\nI'd prefer to see another Arcade skin on a champion that hasn't gotten a skin for a while. Kennen comes to mind, his ulti would be pretty epic in \"Arcade mode.\" Other candidates include Gragas, Olaf (techno-viking, anyone?), maybe Shen or Singed.","replies":[{"poster":"Slim Chaedi","date":"2014-12-07T14:06:43.199+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Arcade Shyvana, leaving a rainbow in the trail of her ult.","replies":[{"poster":"CRAZIGIRL7","date":"2014-12-13T02:20:47.995+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"That's  cool too but the arcade dragon....LOL","replies":[]},{"poster":"EzeBlood","date":"2014-12-08T21:20:13.564+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The only problem with this would be that we had Championship Shyvana released late this year.
