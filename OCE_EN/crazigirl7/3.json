So we did it. Everything was good. But when I looked at my RP, I didn't lose any. Even my friend didn't lose any. I tested the skin and it seemed to work fine. Today I logged on and I still didn't lose any RP. And now when I clicked on Winter Wonder Orianna, I only lost the RP then. And I didn't even buy it.    \r\n\r\nWhat is going on??? Riot plz reply.","replies":[{"poster":"MasterMirkinen","date":"2015-01-07T02:27:33.392+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Looking on it.\nThanks for the report.","replies":[{"poster":"MasterMirkinen","date":"2015-01-08T02:54:40.273+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey CRAZIGIRL7\n\nWe investigated and it looks like an isolated case.\nThere are several reasons on why this could happen but the one that happened in your case we think was related to the message in the client been lost or delayed from store to platform. By clicking on that item in the store, you forced the refresh. We believe this It is a display issue and not likely to happen in normal cases.\n\nPlease let us know if this happens again.\nMM","replies":[{"poster":"CRAZIGIRL7","date":"2015-01-09T05:32:42.817+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thanks","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"hðnkƒørÇªmíllè","date":"2015-01-07T04:43:47.168+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Same happened to me. When you buy the end of game gift, your RP total doesn't display a reduction in points until you actually enter the store, and go to buy something. A little odd, but your RP still technically goes down after the purchase, it just doesn't display it straight away.","replies":[]},{"poster":"idc","date":"2015-01-07T03:20:26.276+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Yep that happened to me too, but it was deducted once I reloaded the client.
