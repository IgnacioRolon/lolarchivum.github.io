IMO. It's just that he's going to hit unkillable stage earlier than most other tanks in the game so this could be a lever to manipulate if you don't want his other abilities to be nerfed. \n\nQ: Hammer of Justice\nI think you should take away the % or lower it down to 2.5% or something low. \nFor a tank that gives too much damage.\nDepends on the cooldown of this ability though. \nAlso what type of damage is this?\n\nW: Verdict\nThe Ally part sounds alright, makes bruisers turn into tanks pretty much. However the duration seems pretty high. 10 seconds is a long time, long enough to last a whole teamfight in the late game. Tone it down to 4 seconds at max rank i.e. 2/2.5/3/3.5/4 seconds. \n\nThe enemy part sounds too strong. 40% is really strong even if it's just one character. From What I remember, DFG (Deathfire Grasp - an item that was deleted about 4-6 months ago) had increase 15% magic damage only and it was considered core on any AP Assassins, or AP Malphite/Alistars because it boosted damage by a ton. \n40% IMO is absurd, especially when it's from all sources.\nI'd nerf it to like 15% but that's still too strong. IMO. \n\nYou could make it max out at 20% as well as reduce the high duration be between 2 or 3 seconds.\n\nE: I think it should just be a buff on the ally. So that the player doesn't need to reactivate it again to soak up the next CC. \n\nR: Sounds fun and interesting.\n\nI r10 10/10, gr10 work m10.\n____\nEDIT: P.S. Have you thought up of a character lore/background for this guy? He sounds like a part of maybe the tribe/nation that Pantheon/Leona is in or a Demacian.

Linking it to his passive, so that his strength can be tweaked by changing his passive. As for the lore, I am unsure if i want to go solari or damacian for the paladin theme. If we still had summoners i could have made him a summoner tired of the leagues indecisiveness in matter such as the battle of ionia. As a result decided to take justice into his own hands.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Tele","date":"2015-08-31T10:53:47.763+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yeah the ult is definitely too powerful because it's %HP essentially making any tank on the team kind-of useless. Maybe just a sheild equal to 50% of the enemies total HP could be more balanced. You could even add defensive buffs while the shield is active. Also Bulwark is already one of Galio's abilities, so maybe change the name to \"Virtuous Equilibrium\" or some shit.\n\nPretty solid idea though.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Oman2","date":"2015-08-31T06:28:29.914+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"10s for Verdict on an ally may be a little long, but these ideas are pretty cool. It's coming hard to find a unique idea for champion abilities with how many there are, but the ultimate sounds pretty cool. Maybe also have a focus, so you can target an ally and boost them an extra 20% of the team's HP, for when your tank is going in or your carry is under attack.\n\nSome people may not like the idea of \"borrowing\" HP though haha.","replies":[{"poster":"Shyvana Bot","date":"2015-08-31T07:01:24.308+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yeah, i originally thought 10 seconds would be nice because for allies it only affects one attack. Either a big cd or you could waste it on an auto. For the enemy one, i could reduce it to 5 seconds, it doesn't seem very balanced at 10 secs now that you mention it. The ult is really a hit or miss, you don't want to use it when your team has higher hp, because that helps your enemies. Its best used to reverse a team fight.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Hayho Of Okaihau","date":"2015-08-31T05:58:10.481+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"sounds pretty crazily cool","replies":[]}]}
