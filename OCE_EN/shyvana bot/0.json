Currently from B5 to B3 i have been only playing Jinx mostly with some others rarely when i don't get her ( e.g. Leona, annie, vayne, Orianna, Lissandra). I'm looking for advice on the most effective champions currently for climb. I need champions that are safe to play, I'm willing to learn mechanically hard champions or  play ones that are mind numbingly simple. My favourite positions are Adc and mid, i am absolutely mediocre at jungle.","replies":[{"poster":"Project Xayah","date":"2015-02-21T01:44:11.744+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"You'd want to play champs that aren't seen in low elo (like Urgot, Yorick, Quinn etc.) as people wont know how to deal with them, plus they don't get banned.
