I have currently sat through the 20 minute warning 12 times. 7 times it didn&#039;t que me in to a game when the timer ended, so I had to sit through the timer again. And the rest of the times someone else dodges and it kicks me out of que meaning i have to sit through the timer again. I understand that I made a mistake by leaving a couple of games, but this is torture.","replies":[{"poster":"Wuks","date":"2015-12-16T23:23:04.052+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey Vi Bot,\n\nThis could be due to a client issue if you're unable to join matches.
