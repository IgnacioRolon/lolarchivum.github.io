Such as the overwhelming number of Botting accounts in Coop vs AI games. I usually play this game mode to test out my ping, but recently I have come to notice a distinct pattern of gameplay and naming of my teammates. I have noticed that a large major a normal name (Bob, mike, peter, raphael) followed by 4-5 numbers. However Some are sneaky, like my third teammate Peter PK Neil, who played exactly the same as the other bot. He only walked down the middle of the lane right into the turrets over and over and over. \r\n\r\nI posted my post match screen, Im not entirely sure if the don&#039;t name and shame rule applies to bots. Im tired of always reporting bots and playing a game with them a week later. Its time Riot did something about this.","replies":[{"poster":"Idlehumor","date":"2016-01-10T17:54:46.375+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'm originally from NA and I've been trying to level up my summoner on OCE to play with my aussie friends. I just now had a Co-Op match with 4 botter teammates. Was the first time on OCE out of 16 games of co-op that I've lost. most co-op games have at least 2 botters. Is the OCE server just being ignored? Not enough staff to ban all the botter accounts?  (this wouldn't surprise me as there are probably thousands)","replies":[{"poster":"CannibaLCandy2","date":"2016-07-08T17:42:15.184+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It's the same in NA bro I had a game where 3 of my team are bots. 2 are poorly coded 1 is on par with an intermediate bot.
