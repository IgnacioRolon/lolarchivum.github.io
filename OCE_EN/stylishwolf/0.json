She&#039;d even show her 35 ms ping just to taunt the team. Reported her and nothing has happened and I&#039;m pretty sure something must happen in 15 minutes or nothing will.

Not only that but it's been 8 long years that Riot has been running this god-forsaken game and they're still unable to tackle players who int? Pft complete and utterly pathetic","replies":[{"poster":"Project Xayah","date":"2018-03-11T09:40:35.917+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"That's not what I'm saying.\n\nWhat I'm saying is that, based on the information I, *as a player*, have access too, there is very little to support that this case of trolling/griefing is consistent across games. It seems fairly obvious that, in the game in question, it's almost definitely a case of trolling/griefing, however the information that Riots people would be working with is far greater and may take some time for the case to actually get through the system and be properly reviewed. Generally, they want to be sure they're actually getting the right people, hence why it takes longer than it probably should for a lot of those kinds of players to receive punishment, and with little or no consistency of the behaviour within their history, it makes it harder to determine how necessary the punishment is (given it's basically a straight escalation to 14-day ban for gameplay offences, as I understand).\n\nIt's not that Riot is simply incapable of tackling these kinds of players, but the fact remains that gameplay offences are a lot harder to pin down and review, it's not as simple as reading a few lines of chat (which is something that *can* be done relatively efficiently using an automated system) and so requires plenty of manual input. If you took a look at other games, you might notice that a fair few of them struggle with dealing with such players, not (necessarily) because of any innate fault within their systems, but because of the difficulty of tackling that kind of behaviour.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Periscope","date":"2018-03-11T09:37:28.591+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I looked at that match history, and it does look like that player was inting.
