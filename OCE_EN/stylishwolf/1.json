I&#039;ve known from experience that you can easily get away with Inting and I&#039;ve seen toxic streamers/players online who&#039;ve inted ranked games so many times but were only banned once their account reached the front page of Reddit. I wanted to know if Riot had any specific or special tools that helped tackle and rightfully punish these players as the Instant Feedback System is probably not your best option.","replies":[{"poster":"Periscope","date":"2018-03-01T18:33:02.080+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"Intentional feeding is pretty difficult to detect, but if you notice it, even in one kill, then report it. The system won't get better if you label every 1/10/3 Lee Sin as a feeder when they're really trying their best and just didn't have a good game. Make sure to use the comments portion to write down anything leading up to what you thought was intentional feeding.","replies":[{"poster":"Exarch Leona","date":"2018-03-03T05:45:50.252+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"-Trying their best \n-Goes in to a 1v5\n\nYeah.
