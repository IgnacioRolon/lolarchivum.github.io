Then I started a game, think that would refresh my dodge timer count. Then I saw this stupid no tank comp and unfriendly players on my team in a ranked game which I know I would certainly lose so I dodged it. Next thing I know I got a whopping **30 min dodge timer**!!! Absolutely unfair.","replies":[{"poster":"dragon poo","date":"2017-10-22T18:28:07.593+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"So, tankless comps can win in solo queue because games can snowball out of control early and often do. when you complain about tanks in solo it means nothing as usually you need  some sort of decent cohesion for it to even make a tank relevant.","replies":[]},{"poster":"SEKAI","date":"2017-10-22T04:03:23.777+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Pretty sure it's 5min, 10 or 15 min, then 30 min?
