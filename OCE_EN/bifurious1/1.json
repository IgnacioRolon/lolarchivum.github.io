No one afk&#039;d and there were honors all round afterwards. Good to see such sportsman like conduct and no toxicity. It was a normal, the other team won by getting baron catching someone out and pushing for the win.","replies":[{"poster":"Gloric","date":"2016-08-01T11:48:19.065+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"This is one of those things I am personally a bit... irrationally angry about. I absolutely detest this type of long game. In my mind it shows a clear lack of understanding of how to play the game, how to press an advantage and win a game.\n\nI mean over 1 hour? come on, if either team comes out on top of a team fight, it should be over, they push and win. What are even the respawn timers at 90 minutes+? jesus.","replies":[{"poster":"Sloth Almighty","date":"2016-08-01T14:27:21.751+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Only gone over the hour mark twice, longest about 68 minutes i think. It was indeed an epic game, both teams were about as equal as you could make it. I love those games, makes the risk of making a mistake that much higher, it really is a lot of fun!","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"WoadKethunt","date":"2016-08-01T06:23:37.310+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"i had a  80 something minute game as ekko support (built tank/support items) back when ekko was released in all his unerfed glory the game came down to vision control neither team could siege that well, the enemy fizz managed to get a blind five man fish when we were death bushing but his team was slow to react and we ended up having a team fight to end all team fights","replies":[]},{"poster":"Maraudaur","date":"2016-07-31T21:36:00.220+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"AWESOME!
