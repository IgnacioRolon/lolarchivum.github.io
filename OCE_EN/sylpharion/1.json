In my pov instead of making it slowing you more across the duration like its name suggests, it should decay like most other slows that slows for a lot and a good amount of time for e.g Glitterlance.\r\n\r\nIf it lasted for 2 seconds and it kept its effect I would mind it as much but it&#039;s pretty annoying for people without a gapcloser or even with one but little to no kiting potential, Wither makes it a bit too easy for ganks to be made or roams from the mid / bot lane. I&#039;ve seen things where even if the top laner spots the jungler at the river, Nasus can wither and repeatedly beat at the person for free damage and cause them to practically lose the lane without a gank due to them having to burn flash or burning flash and end up still dying.\r\n\r\nI find his kit pretty well balanced and there&#039;s nothing much about him, his core ability in my pov is not his Q but rather Wither that makes him so strong in the mid game.","replies":[{"poster":"Lauricella3","date":"2015-05-09T14:22:28.037+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I personally think that the slow amount should be lowered then nasus should steal X % of targets movespeed (and attack speed maybe???) with wither","replies":[]},{"poster":"SEKAI","date":"2015-05-01T12:09:51.428+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Wither is only strong in mid game if you don't oppress him during his weakest early phase and let him farm, and if you either don't ward or have 0 form of escape/cc when you need to escape ganking.\n\nOtherwise, standard routine applies. Abuse his early, if he is looking for trades simply trade back and back off when you bait out his ulti if he has it, and maintain your lane presence so he is not going anywhere with his farming.\n\nIf you can control his farming, he is gone.","replies":[{"poster":"Sylpharion","date":"2015-05-02T04:07:14.946+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yeah I realized but in the current meta there are little champions who can really fully bully Nasus out of lane, Riven used to one of the few but now that the tank meta is in where there's such thing as Nunu Top, Hecarim Top and Sion Top, it really doesn't let you bully Nasus out of lane as much. He get can a single tank item and just keep farming regardless. You can't really 'stop' Nasus from getting stacks even if you completely bully him, you have to bully him and win all or at least another lane.","replies":[{"poster":"Antodara","date":"2015-05-02T05:30:31.963+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"There's a LOT of champs that can bully Nasus into tower farm, which is a bad state because he misses a lot of CS due to tower.\n\nDarius has insane early damage and Nasus has none, meaning darius Q's nasus chunking his health and zoning him.\nRiven can still do it very easily, and is a great counterpick.\nTeemo can shit on Nasus at levels 1-5, and then afterwards can harass him enough that he wastes ult, or has to tower farm again.\nRenekton can straight up kill nasus at level 1-2, landing a w and a lot of autos and then two e's and ignite to secure a first blood, crippling nasus' farm.\n\nOne tank item doesn't mean diddly. He can't just farm, because with the above champs, they can harass him enough to keep him away from farm if he doesn't want to feed. That, and you communicate ganks to shut him down and make him 0/5 by the 15 min mark.\n\nIt's about teamwork and understanding how nasus works. I can't believe how many people just say \"oh this champ can just do x and then they win\"","replies":[{"poster":"Sylpharion","date":"2015-05-02T10:27:49.591+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"For me, I don't think Nasus is instawin, but rather the fact that his Wither has almost no counterplay available other than full kiting or using most not if all your gap closers to run away. I know all those champions can really rid Nasus but all not if all the counters above sooner or later get wrecked, though Nasus will lose a lot of farm under turret, with a gank that can be easily executed using the immense slow from Wither will really stop you from being able to do much.\n\nI guess it also comes to the situation but whenever I've been in an experience with Nasus regardless of enemy or teammate, most people can't escape Nasus alone using just their dash / blink. For me the only successful way of getting away from Nasus is actually going through  a wall which isn't always there, the only champion I've seen completely counter Nasus regardless is LeBlanc. Her double chains or double distortion is like hell to Nasus.\n\nI think I've had more good experiences against Nasus then bad experiences but in most situations early game, if your kit doesn't have a major gap closer to escape or a kiting kit then it's practically dead once he gets rolling, not saying you lose the game but your lane is practically lost from there on.","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"BarryButcher","date":"2015-05-01T17:37:05.795+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The fact that it ramps up over time isn't the problem, its the fact that it lasts 5 seconds for a point and click ability LOL\n\nNasus isn't that much of a problem though really. I mean, if he gets fed or is allowed to free farm then sure, he can 2-hit almost anyone, but to be fair, any champion that is fed or allowed to free farm can pretty much do that same thing. Nasus just makes it worse because he can 3-hit the turrets too.\n\nDon't really think Nasus needs to be touched. Unless Riot want to make his abilities more \"interactive\". Like, Wither only slows for the base 35% but ramps up ONLY if the enemy is inside his Spirit Fire.","replies":[{"poster":"Sylpharion","date":"2015-05-02T04:09:17.535+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"That's actually a really good idea, I find that Nasus is a bit repetitive, you W and Q and late game Spirit Fire doesn't really do much for Nasus. If you give Nasus the W / E interaction it'd really give Spirit Fire more use and benefit.\n\nIf I had to propose a Nasus rework Spirit Fire would be similar to Trundle's W / E (the one that makes a huge ring) and boost up Wither if his target is inside it.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Vapid","date":"2015-05-02T00:06:54.917+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Just abuse his early game so later on he just becomes a guy that withers someone for 5s and dies in 3.","replies":[]}]}
