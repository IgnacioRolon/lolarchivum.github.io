Our current jungler does not have the mechanics (is silver) and isn&#039;t as great as we would like but our synergy is very good with him. We&#039;re a bunch of high schoolers, but we&#039;re not twelvies or anything so don&#039;t worry about it.  \r\n\r\nMust be at least plat and have Skype, we&#039;re quite serious but not over the top or serious-serious like trying to aim into professional, we just hope to and we will if we can. Preferably high plat - or low diamond, please realize your playing with some mid - low plats but despite our rank, I find that we&#039;re quite good at the game. (trying to be as modest as possible)","replies":[{"poster":"Brussknopp","date":"2015-07-07T15:40:58.600+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey man, \n\nIGN: Brussknopp\nI'm a plat 5 jungle main.
