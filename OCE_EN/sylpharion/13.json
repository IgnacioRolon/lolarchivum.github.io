(I Know)","subforum":"Gameplay & Strategy","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Short post.\r\n\r\nJust wanted to say that Kassadin could have a stronger sustain lane if his W restored mana per hit like Jayce in Hammer Form. I find his high mana costs early game and low damage really puts him apart from most mid laners. Early game his mana isn&#039;t that high either so even with close to 0 Mana he only restores about 100 Mana (aka 1 Spell) before becoming OOM again. If he was able to restore like 4 / 5 / 6 / 7 / 8 mana per hit just so he can have that extra mana sutain in the early game and maybe double if he kills a unit. He doesn&#039;t have to gain an incredible amount like 10 ( x 2) but something like 4 - 6 per hit would be really neat ^.^","replies":[{"poster":"GoForkYourself","date":"2015-03-28T17:40:47.920+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"he used to, then people cried cuz an he was strong, so he got nerfed into the ground","replies":[{"poster":"Yuudachi","date":"2015-03-29T06:32:56.424+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"***","replies":[{"poster":"JasonWazza","date":"2015-03-29T07:47:11.383+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Zed has been nerfed as well (though about as much as lee sin has been nerfed)","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"JasonWazza","date":"2015-03-28T04:48:49.992+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"a) Jayce struggles to be in a lane where he can get hits off in hammer form without being smacked around.\nb) Kassadin is a late game champion\nc) Kassadin is fine as is, this is to make sure he doesn't dominate early.","replies":[{"poster":"Sylpharion","date":"2015-03-28T12:30:10.218+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I think Kassadin is the same thing, in the current meta he's extremely weak early game and if he's pushed hard enough only his Q / E for farm.","replies":[{"poster":"JasonWazza","date":"2015-03-28T14:17:16.087+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"He's MEANT to be extremely weak early game.","replies":[{"poster":"Sylpharion","date":"2015-03-28T23:46:37.996+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hmmm :< I - I just love Kassadin T.T I don't have any trouble in the early game to be honest since a lot of players just rather free farm and get perfect farm early game than force me out of lane but when they do and push me under turret. I wish I was able to restore a bit more mana when I am able to get off those auto attacks to at least farm when the wave is pushed into the middle.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}
