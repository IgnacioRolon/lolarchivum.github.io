(1 / 4 / 7 / 10 / 13)\n\n>Armour Penetration: 3% / 6% / 9% / 12% / 15% (Does not stack with other %*)\nMagic Penetration: 4 / 8 / 12 / 16 / 20\nDamage Reduction: 10% / 7.5% / 5%\n\nHer passive makes her a very weak early game causing her to have more damage reduced than armour / magic resistance reduced.\nIf Last Whisper for example gives 35% and this only gives 15%, the armour penetration will no longer be in use and the % of Last Whisper will take over. So it can only either be the 15% or the 35%.\n\n\n**Q:** Script : Distort\nAnnah enchants her bullet and fires it in a VERY thin line towards the target, passing through it.\nWhen the bullet reaches its full distance the area around every enemy target hit becomes distorted causing them to collapse on each other.\nIf no unit is around the distorted target(s) to collapse on then they will only take damage.\n(Long as definition after effects)\n\n>Range: 900 (+300*)\nDistort Range: 200\nDamage: 45 / 90 / 135 / 180 / 225 + 60% of AP\nCooldown: 8 / 7.5 / 7 / 6.5 / 6\nMana Cost: 55\n\n*The max cast range is 900 and then it extends for another 300 pass the target before causing every target hit to have the area distorted and then like Orianna&#039;s ult or Viktor&#039;s W collapse on each other. Nothing happens when the bullet hits the target, the damage, the distortion, everything happens after the bullet has reached max distance.\n\n\n**W:** Script : Substitute\nAnnah throws a script towards any unit (even wards) swapping positions (if champions then she&#039;ll just teleport to them) with it and taunts enemies near the swapped unit causing them to attack it.\n\n>Range: 700\nTaunt Range: 150\nTaunt Duration: 1 attack / 1 second\nCooldown: 14 / 13 / 12 / 11 / 10\nMana Cost: 50\n\n\n**E:** Script : Prismatic Catastrophe \nAnnah chucks a script in the air then shoots it with her gun, causing a large area around her to mark all enemy units, one by one 5 lights (red, orange, yellow, green, blue) start to fly down slamming down enemies causing them to be stunned (prioritizes champions).\n\n>Range: 600\nDamage: 60 / 100 / 140 / 180 / 220 + 70% of AP\nStun: 1.5 seconds\nCooldown: 9\nMana Cost: 65 / 70 / 75 / 80 / 85\n\nThought it takes animation delay for the chucking of the script / shooting, enemies are marked as soon as the ability is cast and is able to cut the animation by moving, attacking or using an ability but if the champion does nothing and stands there then the animation of the script throwing and gun shooting continues.\n\n\n**R:** Script : Ground Gladius\nAnnah targets an enemy champion and slams the scripture at her feet connecting the two, after a delay, if she is still and the target are still both alive she causes stalagmites to shoot up from the ground around her and the target, knocking enemies up into the air. If this is not the case the cooldown will be reduced to 50% of the base cooldown.\n\nIf the target is suddenly untargetable by an item then stalagmites will only shoot up from her personal AoE, Fizz's E does not count as this as he still takes damage from damage overtime effects, Vladimir's Blood Pool is in the same situation as Fizz's E, they both do not take damage but stalagmites still shoot up. \n\n>Range: 400\nDelay: 2 / 1.5 / 1\nDamage: 150 / 375 / 400 + 70% of AP\nAirborne: 1 / 1.25 / 1.5 second\nCooldown: 130 / 110 / 90\nMana Cost: 150 \n\nWith the huge delay, the target can easily run away from their allies or use Zhonya&#039;s and become completely unaffected.\n\n\n**Lore:** \nAs a young child she loved to read, and the library was her favourite place, spending the majority of her spare time there, she loved to read and think. She just loved he idea of reading, when she was finally allowed to go to the library by herself she wandered off to find a place in the library where no one could intrude her reading and have a place just all to her, she came across a room that seemed very odd. Upon opening the door she found the room full of scrolls, she opened them one by one, reading them and found out that they were scriptures, not scrolls.\n\nAnnah took the scriptures home to read what they held, while walking home she overheard a group of soldiers talking to one another \"The chief ordered us to hunt for some person with old scrolls, he even told us to kill them if see anyone holding or possessing them, what a joke, why would they waste our time for some lousy old scrolls.\" she didn&#039;t know what to do, frightened, she ran home and took the gun out of her parents cupboard, running off into the woods.\n\nAs she ran, she fell and caused the scriptures to rip, causing its magic to deplete into the air and enter her body. Afterwards she felt a burst of energy running through her body which felt like magic. She picked up the gun and inspected her body for wounds but rather found out that her body had matured, she also heard voices around her which told her to follow them, without anything else she could do or anywhere else she could go, she followed the voices...\n\n---","replies":[{"poster":"Sylpharion","date":"2015-05-01T11:30:56.675+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Ultimate has been nerfed slightly, so if the target or herself dies the effect will be nullified and the cooldown will be reduced to 50% of the abilities' base cooldown reduction.","replies":[]},{"poster":"JasonWazza","date":"2015-04-03T10:49:43.009+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":">Starts at level 1 and automatically levels every 5 levels until maxed.

X gets hit, 1 and 2 collapse onto X. \n\nIf you'd like I could change it to 100 Range where its even lower than melee attack range ^.^ \n\nUhm, yeah she could but I don't know if she was designed to be a support, I can totally see her as a support / ap top / mid, I would find that pretty awesome to move wards as well. That was a really big factor when I was going to move her but I wanted to make something in the game that isn't already implemented, I think I'll change it to something I have in mind. By the way, I don't think ADC's even have a ward hop ability, isn't Katarina the only champion that can even jump to wards? But hey.. never question the people.\n\nIf you even read her abilities, her ratios are literally AP... I don't think she was ever combined to be an ADC... she has 1, no steroids, 2 barely any ad. You'll literally have to break the meta just to get her as an adc, like every adc has at least a steroid, Lucian's Passive, Vayne's Q and Ult, Graves E, Jinx's Q Attack Speedbuff, etc. She doesn't even have 1 SINGLE AD RATIO... I think you've gotten it all mixed up, she's an AP Mid Laner that uses her gun to cast spells rather than a staff...\n\nI think all your comments are from an ADC perspective, just because she uses a gun doesn't mean that she is an adc, I can get that most ADC's use guns but if you're going to lane with only base damages and auto attacks while every ability uses magic damage... you're literally Corki or Ezreal without any steroids and any AD Ratios, imagine walking to lane with 400 AD but your abilities be doing less than her auto.\n\nShe's not going to be a very good or even top tier adc in my pov, she can be a support but not an adc. Maybe I confused you with the armor penetration but the point was so she was able to poke enemies during her early levels when she's most weak.\n\nI'm not going to make any changes yet until I've confirmed that you are saying what you are saying thinking what she's meant to be, an AP Caster or Assassin like Orianna. \n\nCiao ~","replies":[{"poster":"JasonWazza","date":"2015-04-04T03:56:40.120+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> like every adc has at least a steroid\n\nArmour pen is a steroid (and is a massive ass late game steroid).\n\nYou basically have a tank shredder passive, and that is a lot of what ADC's do, and an ADC that can use a stun is pretty bloody strong, sure the abilitys will do \"no damage\" but their usefulness is in the utility.\n\nShe can be played in almost any role (her jungle clear might be a bit shit though.)","replies":[{"poster":"Sylpharion","date":"2015-04-04T11:56:40.565+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"That is true, I should probably remove the armor penetration from % to just base since it'd be 50% with Last Whisper, you'd rather have a base + % then 2 %s that add up to some massive number.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}
