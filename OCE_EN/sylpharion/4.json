Loss Forgiven for people who were affected? I think some people actually lost because of this when they were high ahead since some people connect earlier than others and in teamfights the carry coming back or anyone can make a huge difference.","replies":[{"poster":"Sylpharion","date":"2015-01-24T14:27:10.103+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Well I didn't and when 4 / 6 on my Prov, it could've been a 5/5 and gotten to a better rank like gold instead of silver 2 if they gave me one.

As time went on they got larger, one disconnect lasted about 3 minutes and everyone reconnected at the same time, things were running smoothly then it just disconnected again. Waiting for 10 minutes with the \"attempting to reconnected\" then quit. Restart LoL, game doesn't exist. So I got a loss prevention I guess but our team was doing quite well despite the DC'ing.","replies":[{"poster":"TOXIC Devourer","date":"2015-01-22T06:28:23.963+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"tHIS SERIOUSLY BETTER BE LOSS FORGIVEN!\n\n WTF!","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"TOXIC Devourer","date":"2015-01-22T06:20:30.546+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Riot seriously?
