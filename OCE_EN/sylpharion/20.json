I will try to do the rest of him soon.\n\n**Lore:**\n\nBefore Runeterra was created Ao Shin helped create it, helping the creation of the sky and wind, but mostly the tempest. The rain that the tempest brought with it helped create almost all the life on Runeterra. All the power that the dragon has used to help create life on a useless giant piece of molten land had caused him to wear himself out, putting him into a deep slumber.\n\nDuring the time that Ao Shin rested, the storm he created continue to rage on cooling down the whole of Runeterra. The cooling process caused life to start rapidly, not long after his slumber trees and plants started to sprout out. Inside those magical plants held creatures of all shapes and sizes, some still unknown, some known and are known until today; humans. Humans started out very innocent, exploring the world, knowing nothing of the world that they had been born in. Being protectors of nature they did their duty stopping violence of other creatures and only killed what they hunted so they would live, but not to go on a spree. The humans wise words did not last very long, not long before Ao Shin's reawaken a plague had erupted mysteriously, corrupting the minds of humans. \n\nThe plague had caused humans to destroy everything they could find and see, the plague spread violently, almost half of the population had been wiped out.\nHumans that have not yet been affected heard about this and split into factions that would destroy the affected people these factions were named; Ionia and Demacia.\nIonia worked on finding an immunity or cure for this disease, while Demacia worked on training themselves to fight the enemies they called Noxians.\nWhen Ionia had finally found the cure, contained in a gas form, they spread all of it across the giant battlefield where Demacia and Noxus were fighting. Almost instantly the Demacian's were cured, but the Noxian's had been affected for too long and were incurable, the only way was to kill them but they were unstoppable. So Demacia and Ionia had to go and use Black Magic, calling upon heroes named \"Summoners.\"\n\nThese summoners were like gods, they summoned their own creatures to fight and soon the battlefield was known as the League of Legions.\n\nFinally Ao Shin had awakened, he was smiling, laughing, very proud of himself for creating such magnificent creatures, but when he looked down...\nAll he could see was blood, destruction, wrath and gore all over the battlefield, nothing but war and envy, the heart of the humans had been corrupted and completely destroyed. He could no longer watch what he called the protectors, fight what they were meant to protect, love and be allies with.\n\nAo Shin descended from the sky and forced himself into the League of Legends, not stopping until all war, rampage and wrath stopped.\n\n*\"I will not rest until all war has ended, I will be the one that frees them from their corruption.\" - Ao Shin.*\n\n\n**STATS:**\n\n**HP:** 341 / +89 / 1943 @ 18\n**MP:** 312 / +49 / 1194 @ 18\n**AD:** 41 / +3 / 95 @ 18\n**AS:** .625 / +.112 / .737 @ 18\n**AR:** 11 / +4 / 83 @ 18\n**MR:** 30 / +0 / 30 @ 18\n**RN:** 525 / +0 / 675 @ 18\n**MV:** 335 / +0 / 335 @ 18\n\n\n**ABILITIES:**\n\n**PASSIVE:** Erode / Rust\nAo Shin's abilities cause the enemy to *Erode* while his basic attacks cause them to ~~Rust~~.\n\n*  ~~Rust~~ causes his enemies armor and magic resist to shred and decay over time, stacking multiple times.\n*Erode* causes his abilities to deal a portion of their health over time, dealing base damage to minions and monsters.\n\n>~~Rust:~~ Enemies lose 1 / 2 / 3 of their armor and magic resistance per second, this affect stacks up to 5 times.\n>~~Rust~~ levels up when Ao Shin hits levels : 1, 6, 11 and last for 5 seconds.\n\n>*Erode* deals 1 / 2 / 3% of his enemies max. health over the duration period.
