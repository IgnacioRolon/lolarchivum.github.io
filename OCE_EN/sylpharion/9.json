(Morgana&#039;s Black Shield counts.)\n\n\n**Lore:**\n\nDuring the time of the gods, the goddess of time Zhonya had gone berserk causing the heavens to tremble and power to pour. The Temple of Time  raged on and the world felt the imbalance, the heavens called help of an unknown man to stop her. {{champion:432}}  But he refused and flew off saying there was no immediate trouble.\n\nWhile the heavens trembled the League of Legends were forming, in this time phase he felt the slow destruction of the fabric of time and space. He knew in order to stop her he must take her most precious item, her ring, Zhonya&#039;s Ring. While she slumbered due to rest after the use of so much magic, but while she slumbered she still emitted powerful energy creating a giant barrier that only he was able to pass through it and stole the ring while she slept. When she woke, the heavens cried for the last time before dying out.\n\n----\n\nZhonya was devastated, with her powers gone she was removed from her kingdom and was sent down to Earth as punishment, she was no longer in control of time or part of the gods.\nShe became bloodthirsty, vengeful but also regretted, wanting to take back what was hers she ventured out to find it, on her way she knew she needed something else in order to replace the precious ring and give her just enough magic on the way, she found a broken hourglass on her journey and decided it would fit her and enchanted it with her remaining powers of time.\n\nSoon she settled and found herself in the League, she saw the power of the ring distributed  through the large screen, angry and mindless, because it was being used so often it had gone to a state only just stronger than the hourglass she had on hand. Without another second of thinking she used the remaining powers in the hourglass to freeze time and swap the two items, stealing the ring to take back what was truly hers. Not knowing that the power inside of the hourglass continued to regain its magic, she left it there almost like an exchange.\n\n---\n\nAfter she was allowed back into the heavens, she overheard two girls talking about the new person in the Field of Justice, she heard them saying that the being there, was the being that had stopped her rampage years ago. Now with her ring and new gained powers over the years, she froze her heart (gods have no use for it) to stop her emotions from getting the way and she&#039;s thirsty for revenge.","replies":[{"poster":"KingDinger","date":"2015-03-26T07:20:13.132+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"welder? she shuts time together or something?\n\nor wielder? she USES time.","replies":[{"poster":"Sylpharion","date":"2015-03-26T07:26:49.425+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=KingDinger,realm=OCE,application-id=hIjvqaz6,discussion-id=IrNArLMo,comment-id=0001,timestamp=2015-03-26T07:20:13.132+0000)\n>\n> welder? she shuts time together or something?\n> \n> or wielder? she USES time.\n\nEh, welder as in she creates time. If you search up the definition of welder you'd know. Like welding metal, a process to sculpt or put them together. Like welding a sword. She melds time together with her ultimate and passive to stop time, it's hard to explain and there isn't a really good enough word in my short range of vocabulary to have a word that can describe it.

Her passive.\n2. Rooting like stopping time.\n3. Her ultimate.\n\nIt's a temporary amount of time being shut together, hard to explain but I'll hope you get it and delete your comment or at least edit the words.
