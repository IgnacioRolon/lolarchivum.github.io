Her main type of crowd control is charm, just like Ahri&#039;s Charm, it has the same effect but she can use it on multiple people instead of an AoE Stun. She is called The Catastrophe because she creates one wherever she goes by weaving together the sins of humans and using it into a spell. \n\nI&#039;m going to try to give an estimate using Riot&#039;s way instead of actual stats.\n\n**Health:** 514.4 (+80 per level)\n**Health Regen:** 6.505 (+0.6 per level)\n**Mana:** 312 (+58 per level)\n**Mana Regen:** 5.2 (+1.1 per level)\n**Attack Damage:** 53.04 (+3 per level)\n**Attack Range:** 625\n**Attack Speed:** 0.668 (+2% per level)\n**Armor: 20.88** (+3.5 per level)\n**Magic Resist:** 30 (+0 per level)\n**Movement Speed:** 350\n\n**Passive:** Weave: Desires\nWhen an enemy is hit by an attack or an ability of yours, they gain 1 mark of Desire.

If you catch her off after you&#039;ve been charmed or after she has used her W, there isn&#039;t anyway she can actually escape from you.\nAll spells that channel and are targeted both still activate even with enemies moving into fog of war. Once in range, clicked onto the target then unless some form of crowd control stops her then the ability will keep channeling and hit.","replies":[{"poster":"Sylpharion","date":"2015-05-20T06:34:14.236+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"**CHANGES 1.4:**\n\nOLD:\n**Q:** Weave: Wrath\nAdora channels for .5 seconds before firing off a long range targeted wisp at the enemy target dealing damage to all enemy units it passes through the spell still channels and hits even if they go into fog of war or become invisible.

Also in a lot of situations enemies would stay too far away from her to allow her to successfully and deal damage at max range. Taking this into note I raised her minimum damage but lowered her max damage but for compensation I lowered the mana cost at higher levels but without any or a lot of ability power then the % will not deal the damage it used to needing a minimum of 300 AP. I raised many of her mana costs so that she is forced into taking Chalice or a Tear or a Rod of Ages. Taking Rod of Ages or Chalice will really put her back in the early - mid game with low damage due to their costs but low ability power.","replies":[]},{"poster":"kJs","date":"2015-05-19T12:44:59.242+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I find it really annoying to have to find out which ult or which change is the current one, I think you should just Edit it but tell people what you changed, small summary in the comments.

Also I do post the changes in the comments, if you were talking about NOT doing it anymore than I shall not after this one last change. \n\nAnd yes, there are invulnerability times if you look at the passive it clearly stats 14 / 11 / 8 seconds of invulnerability.\nI'll tone done the Q damage and probably add a bit more to the E as she's a very bursty mage with 2 high damaging abilities and a supporting / dps ability to just deal that extra bit of damage.\n\nI didn't mainly put how fast the abilities travel like I used to in a LOT of my champion concepts on the forums as I don't have a broad perspective of them. I know how fast they travel and all but it just seems like I either make them too fast or too slow (mainly too fast)\n\nAnd could I have  further clarification on > W: (Not sure about which one)","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"5 Crow 1 Fiddle","date":"2015-05-09T12:45:55.288+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"TL;DR\n\nLore:\nI don't even know anymore, after Riot changed the lore system I'm not even sure how to write lores anymore.","replies":[{"poster":"Sylpharion","date":"2015-05-09T13:08:33.962+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Haha, pretty much.

So instead of toning it down which would kill her farming abilities, I decided to lower her range and will do if i think she will bully other champions.\n\nAlso, continuing on from her poke damage. Her long auto attacks combined with her Q behind targeted and her E based off their missing health for the bit of extra OOMPH. It was too easy to cut down an enemies health early game and allow an easy gank with a targeted charm. So I made her early game mana considerably lower so she would have to only use Q and / or auto attacks to poke instead of spamming her abilities. Also because putting 2 stacks on the target meant a targeted charm with Q / E I made her mana regen and mana lower so when her jungler comes for a gank she needs to watch her mana a bit better.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Urgot Bot","date":"2015-05-09T16:03:57.871+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"dis chick likes to stand still alot. also, that level 5 w (w/o scaling) is like malzahars w at max rank with full build. das some crazy damage right there. also, im failing to see how she is a 'high cc champion' as you said, when she only has a slow and a charm. shes more like a nuke champ like veigar or xerath, rather than a cc champion...","replies":[{"poster":"Sylpharion","date":"2015-05-10T02:38:35.656+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Well high crowd control doesn't necessarily mean like Sejuani or etc, but she usually scares people off when they get 2 stacks or else it is an instant charm with Q / E so 'the crowd is controlled' and her ultimate is similar to a Ziggs ult where you'd run away and maybe end up splitting.\nYeah she does like to stand still a lot but that's to make her balanced, so you have a chance to fully interrupt her full combo if she tries to use R / Q since with R / E the ultimate would end up hitting the targets before the E reaches. \n\nYeah she is a high nuke champion like Veigar or Xerath but her passive and easy use with it really tend to try and as far away from her or else the charm will be targeted if they still try to go near.\n\nAnd regarding Malzahar's W and her W, I based her W on it, but instead of having huge scaling it's only just 3 / 3.75 / 4.5 / 5.25 / 6% no matter what you do and how much AP you have.
