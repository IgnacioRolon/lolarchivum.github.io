They think it was because instead of being born after nine months, she was born eight months later the due date. She walked through the whole night earning her name, Nightwalker. In the peaceful town of Ionia where she grew up knowing nothing about the world until she started to help her dad collect medicinal herbs in the hills near her house. One day while her dad was collecting the herbs. the Noxians captured him and told him to send a note to his family saying that if they don't give them their daughter they will kill the whole village. Unable to do anything, they were forced to give away their precious daughter.\n\nOver the years, the commander of Noxus taught Nightwalker how to be a fearful spearman. Earning the title of the Royal Noxus Army Captain.\nBut after Noxus' fall to the Ionian's Nightwalker took all the blame as she was one of the people to lead the Noxian army, completed tormented at her state. She decided to go into a state of hunger and thirst for three whole months, to torture herself even more. Nightwalker sat next to a spring and was near plentiful fruits and animals to kill and eat. \n\nAfter a month of suffering, she heard a voice that sounded very familiar. Inside she felt like a child again, it was the best she has ever felt in her life. Then she felt a struck from inside her heart, she then remembered what happened when she was just a young girl, she couldn't believe she helped the people that her parents swore to fight against. She knew then she must fight back, but the only place now to find Noxians is in the League of Legends, seeing this she joined the League of Legends. Swore to fight in the name of Ionia and kill any Noxians she comes pass.\n\n\n**Summary of Nightwalker:**\n\nNightwalker is a very strong top laner and in some situation can beat mid laners like Kassadin, mostly forcing them out of lane and denying farm.\nUnlike most champs, she can be built as an AD or AP unlike Jax / Akali / Kayle who are called 'hybrids' but focus on one damage stat, AD or AP.\nThe ability power with cooldown reduction can bring burst and sustain, but in most situations will be dealt as a trinity force top laner.\n\n\n**STATS:**\n\nWIP\n\n\n**ABILITIES:**\n\n**PASSIVE:** Inner Core / Negation Spear: Nullification\n\nAfter going through so much suffering and pain, any bleeding effects have their damage and duration reduced.\n\n>Damage Reduction: 5 / 10 / 15%\n>Duration Reduction: 1 second (1 tick of damage)\n\nNightwalker's spear enchantment causes her abilities to cut through spell shields but deal reduced damage. (Spell Shield is still removed.)\n\n>Damage Reduction: 20 / 15 / 10%\n\nLevels up when Nightwalker hits level 6 and 11.\n\n**Q:** Velocity Spear: Silfarion  http://i.imgur.com/HXcYYov.gif\n\nNightwalker gains a huge movement speed buff, causing her next auto attack to instead dash to the target dealing damage. If Nightwalker dashes to the target, she dances around them doing three strikes applying all on hit effects, after the strikes Nightwalker has three seconds to return back to original position. Waste Mana on return as well, when doing the three strikes, she has max attack speed.\n\n>Dash Range: 600\n>Movement Speed Buff: 10 / 20 / 30 / 40 / 50% for 2 seconds\n>Dash Damage: 5 / 15 / 25 / 35 / 45 (+ 25% AP)\n>Strike Damage: 7 / 14 / 21 / 28 / 35 (+ 10% AP, + 33.3% Total AD)\n>Total Damage: 26 / 57 / 88 / 119 / 150 (+ 55% AP, +100% Total AD)\n>Duration to attack: 7 seconds before expires\n>Cooldown: 11 / 10.25 / 9.50 / 8.75 / 8\n>Mana Cost: 45 \n\nThis is going to be your main gap closer and juke ability, always carry a ward or buy a blue trinket to jump over walls to minions or monsters and juke back by returning. The movement speed buff from this ability can be very handy so always keep a close eye on enemies ganking and like Garen, Q and run away or dash to a nearby minion if needed.\n\n**W:** Gravity Spear: Gravity Core  http://i.imgur.com/mljrfxo.jpg \nhttp://i.imgur.com/K03spVz.gif (Absorbing)  http://i.imgur.com/2dm1cix.gif (Slamming)\n\nNightwalker changes the form of her spear, sucking everything around her in front of her, she then proceeds to jump up than crash her spear down to the ground. Causing all enemies in the spear to take damage and briefly disrupted, all units around the crash zone damages units. \nGravity Core also reduces the cooldown of her all her abilities (including Gravity Core) for each unit sucked in.\n(Disruption is a weaker version of a stun, cancelling abilities and slowing. Still able to move though.)\n\n>Radius: 250\n>Crash Damage: 65 / 100 / 135 / 170 / 205 (+ 60% AP, + 75% Bonus AD.)\n>Area Damage: 30 / 55 / 80 / 105 / 120 (+ 30% AP, + 45% Total AD.) \n>Disrupt Duration: .5 seconds\n>Cooldown Reduction: .5 per unit, champions are doubled. Capped at 2.\n>Cooldown: 8\n>Mana Cost: 65\n\nThis ability used in conjunction with Velocity Spear: Silfarion can be a very deadly combo, opponents unless duelist will mostly try to use an ability or two or a  basic attack then run off. Also try to have one or two minions sucked in with the champion, a way of doing this is pushing them towards their own minions, or cause minion aggro on you so when your use Velocity Spear: Silfarion, you can suck in the minions that are aggro'ing you at the moment.\n\n**E:** Vacuum Spear: Mel Force  http://i.imgur.com/XKgCof7.jpg\n  http://i.imgur.com/HKNAYH7.gif\n\nNightwalker creates a huge blast of wind towards a target in a cone (targeted skillshot like Lucian Q), pushing them back and dealing damage. If they hit any obstacle or unit (includes all units except wards) they will be stunned and if Nightwalker reactivates the ability, all units that were knocked back and hit into are sucked towards Nightwalker.\nIf they are knocked into an enemy, the enemy hit takes damage and the enemy knocked into the enemy hit take bonus damage. (Do you understand? Idek)\n\n>Range: 800\n>Knockback Distance: 600\n>Pullback Distance: 800\n>Damage: 75 / 120 / 165 / 210 / 255 (+ 75% AP, + 100% Base AD.)\n>Bonus Damage: (+ 25% AP, + 33% Total AD.) Enemy that is hit during the knockback takes only this damage.\n>Stun Duration: 1.2 / 1.4 / 1.6 / 1.8 / 2\n>Cooldown: 10 / 9.25 / 8.50 / 7.75 / 7\n>Mana Cost: 65 / 75 / 85 / 95 / 105\n\nThe reason behind Mel Force being at 800 Range and Pullback 800 Range is because, if you want to start your combo. You need to get them into your range for Silfarion. When you hit Mel Force and pull them in, it'd be in perfect range for Silfarion if you push them back at full distance and you won't to need push them back that far to pull them back in and combo up. If needed use your ult to create a wall, use Mel Force, Silfarion and Gravity Core will mostly kill them or put them very low, using Deathfire Grasp, Ignite or auto attacking with Lichbane will really help.\n(Mel Force may suck them in, but it's just closer to the starting point rather than up front in Nightwalker's face.)\n\n**R:** Sealing Spear: Rune Save / Saint Spear: Ravelt  http://i.imgur.com/G4tSDwb.jpg\nhttp://i.imgur.com/EFuG6CG.gif\n(Instead she summons two Ravelts and two beams of light, the action is very similar to this gif.)\nhttp://i.imgur.com/wNBSSqN.gif\n(They're standing up, and the beam is white and much larger. Just for reference if needed.\n\nNightwalker passively gains bonus movement speed, tenacity, magic and armor penetration.\n\n>Movement Speed: 5 / 10 / 15\n>Tenacity: 5 / 10 / 15%\n>Magic Penetration: 5 / 10 / 15\n>Armor Penetration: 10 / 20 / 30\n\nOn activation, Nightwalker gains a secondary ability, she reveals the whole map for a duration. Nightwalker can summon two beams of light to target an enemy from across the map (not global), each beam holds her past and present, one being a pitch black light and the other one an angelic light.\nWhen both light hits an enemy unit they will be stunned and a create a huge nuke around them damage them all targets around them.\n(The two beams of light actually do no damage, they just create the animation. Wisping around the target and forming a beam shape before blowing up the area around them, this beam stuns and creates a wall curving in the direction Nightwalker is in. Enemies can pass, but when using Mel Force it will act like a normal wall and stun them. It also takes time to reach them, which is sad.)\n\n>Reveal Duration: 2 / 3 / 4 seconds\n>Duration: 7 / 8 / 9 seconds to use secondary ability\n>Wall Duration: 7 / 8 / 9 seconds\n>Range: 5500 / 6000 / 6500 (Biggest Range Ultimate at the Moment.)\n>Radius: 400\n>Missile Speed: 3 second at max range. Just divide it by x to get the amount of seconds. This is if they stay in the max range and don't run off while it's reaching them\n>Damage: 275 / 400 / 525 (+ 65% AP)\n>Range: 100 / 200 / 300 (All basic abilities gain bonus range during this time, including vacuum radius, pullback and knockback distance.\n>Stun Duration: 1 / 1.5 / 2\n>Cooldown: 110 / 95 / 80\n>Mana Cost: 100 / 150 / 200\n\nUsing this to create a wall for Mel Force can be very useful, or executing enemies from afar and pissing them off can be very fun. If they are at max range it'd be around three seconds, this is a huge amount of time to prepare for the ability. It'd be even easier with Zhonya's or just press E as Fizz...\n\n\n**How to Play:**\n\nNightwalker is a very simple champion to play, her difficulty may be on the same level as LeBlanc + Half of Vaynes, to perfect her though is going to create a great deal, since all her abilities are part of her combo you want to choose between; Escaping or Bursting. You can't have both at the same, like Ahri and Lux, you can use any of your abilities but without that one crowd control mechanism your combo isn't complete.\n\nIf there're no minions behind the target when you use Mel Force, lock the target up with your ultimate then using the speed buff from Silfarion to reach them, Mel Force, Basic Attack (Dash), Gravity Core, Jump Back. Another way of doing this is to Silfarion, Gravity Core, Jump Back, Mel Force. This isn't very reliant but it is a good move if they're low enough to finish them off, also Mel Force won't be benefiting from the cooldown reduction from Gravity Core which isn't very good in my opinion.\n\nIn my mind, Nightwalker's true forms shines in the late game, if the enemy is grouped up a perfectly timed ult and Mel Force can lock up an entire team for two whole seconds while you dash in and use Gravity Core and do as much damage as you can. With enough cooldown reduction and reduction from Gravity Core, Mel Force should be up as soon as you Dash back and stun for the second time. Though she needs a lot of work before completion since she is very strong at the moment, I think she could be an actual champion if you change her looks, lore and ability names for copyright issues.\n\n-\n\nPlease give me feedback and ideas on how to nerf her abilities seeing she has seven abilities in total. Pullback, Return and her ultimate's secondary effect.\nI'd love to see you guys comment on this champion concept because I'm very proud of it and I find it a lot better in my mind than other concepts I have tried to do abut Erza or other Fairy Tail characters. Though not as work put in as Mira, it is still a work of literature in my mind.","replies":[{"poster":"Last GuardiaN","date":"2014-12-21T06:57:27.162+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"lol it is cool-________- but no way hahha","replies":[{"poster":"Sylpharion","date":"2014-12-21T09:42:20.070+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I think I know that, I think everyone who does a champion concept knows that.

Also at level 1 Ravelt is just the spare, no side spikes or decoration, on level 2 it has the spikes on the side, and at level 3 it looks like the spear in the picture.","replies":[]}]}
