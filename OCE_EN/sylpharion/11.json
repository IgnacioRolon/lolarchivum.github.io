She doesn't need one as badly as the others since Blackfrost users make up for it, but then her abilities just look bad overall.\r\n\r\nAs a champion with only a pair of wings and feet, I was thinking what if her abilities could be tweaked so it could look like something like this:\r\n\r\nFlash Frost :\r\n\r\nInstead of flapping her wings to create a ball, how about she shoots a  ball of ice out of her mouth which isn't too large but gains size as it actually starts moving, this won't affect the ability in any way but may look odd. With the ball she will also have a shard flying right behind it so when she Q's the shard speeds up and the ball slows down so the the shard hits it and explodes the ball, this wouldn't make a difference in speed since the shard is so barely behind it and the delay in game wouldn't make a difference.\r\n\r\nCrystallize :\r\n\r\nAnivia shoots a large gust of air at the icy wind and moves her head up while doing so, creating a wall. This will cause less in game delay when moving so Anivia players have an easier time when chasing and doesn't have to stop for the W delay and then chase.\r\n\r\nFrostbite : \r\n\r\nFrostbite could make it so Anivia actually sends out a laser at the target and then a shard of ice flies from her mouth at the target. You could make it so it would start normally where the shard would be without the laser and just itself like in live. If they're in close range then she'll do a gentle flap and an ice shard will be sent to the target.\r\n\r\nThis would be too much reliant on the actual mouth of hers and not on the wings like what Riot decided so you could leave out Crystallize or only put in Flash Frost with Crystallize or just Frostbite with Crystallize. Or just literally glamour her abilities, to the side her E looks like a pole sent to the enemies face, like it's not even a shard that's hitting their face with end, it's like a literally a pole slamming into their face. And her actions make the delay so unbearable and the way she moves is oh my lord, only Blackfrost can make her actually look good in game like how she makes me look good ","replies":[{"poster":"SkarSkarSkarner","date":"2015-01-30T08:53:17.019+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"http://www.surrenderat20.net/2013/12/anivia-texture-update-in-315.html","replies":[{"poster":"Sylpharion","date":"2015-01-30T08:57:36.723+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=PRIMAWESOME,realm=OCE,application-id=hIjvqaz6,discussion-id=ZEgKNpB2,comment-id=0000,timestamp=2015-01-30T08:53:17.019+0000)\n>\n> http://www.surrenderat20.net/2013/12/anivia-texture-update-in-315.html\n\nI meant like abilities, her abilities and performance / delay is so awkward. I be using ult and then sitting there for like .5 seconds staring into space, I literally have to E then R since if I R then E I'll have to get so close that it's like a Fizz jumping on you to land a perfect combo with no delays. And still I would mess it up somehow.","replies":[]}]}]}
