He is wingless, and also a male, because of this, appearance wise, he looks much more like an elf than a fairy. To meet the theme, instead of brightly yellow coloured fairy dust and particles, it is a lot darker, being almost grey or a shimmery black.\r\n\r\nS&igrave;th is one of the shorter ranged mid laners, having to get really close to auto attack with Aptitude, but this is due to the sheer power of the spell, forcing him to get close if he wants to pull it off. His attacks are blasts of zigzaggy dark energy from his claw staff, similar to Veigar and Viktor&#039;s auto attack combined\r\n\r\n**Health:** 516.2 (+92 per level)\r\n**Mana:**  295 (+55 per level)\r\n**Attack Damage:** 50.5 (+2.8 per level)\r\n**Attack Range:** 425\r\n**Attack Speed:** 0.625 (+2.25% per level)\r\n**Armor:** 19.5 (+3.9 per level)\r\n**Magic Resist:** 30 (+0 per level)\r\n**Movement Speed:** 335\r\n\r\n**Passive:** Karma | Aptitude\r\nS&igrave;th reflects a certain amount of incoming damage based on the total amount of enemy champions around him, reducing the damage he takes while inflicting damage upon his enemies back as magic damage.\r\n&gt;**Reflection:** 2% per champion, max. 3/4/5 (levels 1, 7, 12)\r\n\r\nAfter each spell cast, S&igrave;th gains a buff that causes his next auto attack to deal bonus damage based on his ability power. If done in quick succession (ability, auto attack - repeat, under 2 seconds), the damage will start stacking, dealing more, and more damage every time.\r\n&gt;**Bonus Damage:** 20% of AP + (10 x Level)\r\n&gt;**Stack Damage:** + 50% of the previous damage (e.g: dealt 10 damage before, 10 + 5)\r\n&gt;**Buff Duration:** 4 seconds\r\n&gt;**Cooldown:** 1/.5/0 (levels 1, 6, 11)\r\n\r\n\r\n**Q:** Dust Inundation\r\nS&igrave;th fires a single projectile towards a designated target area, upon making contact with a champion or reaching the end of its destination, it explodes, dealing damage and slowing enemies caught in the explosion, whilst healing allied champions and pets.\r\nEnemy champions who are caught in both the projectile and explosion, only take 50% from the secondary damage dealt to them.\r\n&gt;**Range:** ~ 1100\r\n&gt;**Explosion Radius:** 250\r\n&gt;**Heal:** 50 / 70 / 90 / 110 / 130 (+25% of AP)\r\n&gt;**Damage:** 40 / 80 / 120 / 160 / 200 (+60% of AP)\r\n&gt;**Explosion Damage:** 20 / 40 / 60 / 80 / 100 (+80% of AP)\r\n&gt;**Slow:** 25 / 30 / 35 / 40 / 45% for 1.2 / 1.4 / 1.6 / 1.8 / 2s\r\n&gt;**Mana Cost:** 65 / 70 / 75 / 80 / 85\r\n&gt;**Cooldown:** 9/9/8.5/8/8\r\n\r\nThe ability greatly rewards players who are able to predict enemy movements, causing them to either trigger the explosion, taking both types of damage, or causing them to be hit by both types of damage by just being near the area of effect. With this ability, it doesn&#039;t matter if his team makes the wrong moves or gets poked, S&igrave;th has an AoE heal which can get them back on their feet, ready to fight again.\r\n---\r\n**W:** Glitter Trail\r\nUpon activation of this ability, he gains bonus movement speed, and leaves a trail of fairy glitter where he walks but in a much bigger area (similar to Shyvana&#039;s Burnout in Dragon form), after the buff expires, the trail explodes, stunning enemies caught in it and dealing damage based on how long the buff lasted for. This ability may be recasted early to instantly explode.\r\n&gt;Radius: 600\r\n&gt;Armor / MR Reduction: 8 / 11 / 14 / 17 / 20\r\n\r\n&gt;Trail Radius: 125\r\n&gt;Damage: 10 / 25 / 40 / 55 / 70 (+ 50% of AP) ~ 70 / 140 / 210 / 280 / 350 (+ 50% of AP)\r\n&gt;Stun: .1 / .2 / .3 / .4 / .5s ~ .4 / .8 / 1.2 / 1.6 / 2s\r\n&gt;Bonus MV(S): 14 / 18 / 22 / 26 / 30%\r\n&gt;Duration: ~ 4s\r\n&gt;Mana Cost: 90\r\n&gt;Cooldown: 13 / 12.25 / 11.50 / 10.75 / 10\r\n\r\nGlitter Trail isn&#039;t the best, but the damage is insane if you get anywhere close to 3 seconds. Despite this, it&#039;s mainly used as an escape mechanism or to walk in front of enemies, causing them to walk off track to dodge the ability and at times into your team or if they don&#039;t, take the burst to their face.\r\n---\r\n**E:** Retrogression **(P)** / Inevitable Doom **(A)**\r\nS&igrave;th&#039;s aura causes enemies&#039; defensive stats to be lowered if they stand too close to him, while raising the defensive stats of the two closest allies.\r\n&gt;Radius: 600\r\n&gt;Armor / MR Reduction: 8 / 11 / 14 / 17 / 20\r\n\r\nThis is just to slightly increase the damage enemies take due to being hooked in or too close (probably due to being hooked in).\r\n\r\nS&igrave;th channels for .5s before slamming his staff in front of him, marking all enemies that were inside the cone. Again, after .5s, the targets are dragged towards area where the spell was cast. (so no setting up long ass pulls)\r\n&gt;Cone Degree: 50&deg;\r\n&gt;Cone Radius: 625\r\n&gt;Mana Cost: 60\r\n&gt;Cooldown: 19 / 17.5 / 16 / 14.5 / 13\r\n\r\nThis ability is useful but also not very useful in both ways, the small cone and its angle makes it hard to hit due to the .5s channel. But if you are able to land it, it pays off, the .5s allows your team to set up before the enemy(ies) are pulled towards you. The typical combo is to boost yourself with Fairy Glitter before pulling the enemy in then walking around to make sure when they are pulled back, they are stunned by the aftereffect and slowed right after their already painful stun with Dust Inundation.\r\n---\r\n**R:** True Misfortune\r\nS&igrave;th targets a large area, massively slowing the movements of enemy champions and dealing damage overtime to them while clearing all vision of the enemy on the minimap (can see enemies on the screen normally though), only revealing them if a teammate can see the enemies on their  own screen.\r\n&gt;Cast Range: 900\r\n&gt;Radius: 200\r\n&gt;Damage: 150 / 300 / 450 (+ 60% of AP) over the duration\r\n&gt;Slow: 50 / 60 / 70% (decaying)\r\n&gt;Duration: 2 / 3 / 4 seconds\r\n&gt;Mana Cost: 125\r\n&gt;Cooldown: 140 / 110 / 80\r\n\r\nNot only is this great for team fights, it&#039;s also an amazing engage tool, pretty much a reverse Sivir ult. With Righteous Glory and/or Talisman of Ascension, this ability can be extremely deadly and the cut off minimap is not only crucial, forcing enemies to remove their own champion from their screen to search around, it&#039;s the main reason that this ability is so strong.\r\n---\r\n\r\n**Lore:**\r\n&gt;&quot;Grandma, tell me a story for bedtime!&quot;\r\n&gt;&quot;Sure thing darling, let me tell you the story of a male fairy.&quot;\r\n&gt;&quot;But male fairies don&#039;t exist grandma, they&#039;re called elves!!&quot;\r\n&gt;&quot;Oh dear, yes they do, his name, _S&igrave;th_&quot;\r\n\r\nThere was once a male who was born with majestic fairy wings, that seemed to only dazzle and gleam once touched by the sun&#039;s rays, never was it dull and it never bore. He was successful in magic and was held as the Fairy Queen, despite being a male, but that all changed when a jealous elf with a pair of deadly scissors attacked him at night. His wings were ravished, torn, cut off from his shoulders, blood scattered through the room, though in his sleep, he cried a cry of pain, despair, and agony. The attack was so detrimental on him, that he had lost his title, his rank, his everything, and was exiled from the Fairy Kingdom.\r\n\r\nIn search for a new home, he arrived at Noxus, where he was soon accepted into their barracks as one of the sorcerers, but he wanted more, he wanted more than just a lowly troop that served in war. During his life in the Fairy Kingdom, he had heard of both Ionia and Noxus, he had read much of Runeterra and all of its true natures. Hoping to have a better life, he told leader of the Noxus army about an artifact that was given to the Ionian&#039;s located on the floating villages, though it took great determination and consideration for them to finally believe them, the army was sent out, to invade; the Floating villages of Ionia.\r\n\r\nThe army arrived at the village where they destroyed everything in sight, but the leader of the Noxus army, sent S&igrave;th alongside him to show him where the artifact laid. Wanting to go from rags to riches, he told him the truth, that it was with the village&#039;s great sage, but when they arrived, he was no where to be found. They searched near and far but not after long, he was spotted climbing to Bard mountain, remembering the rumors in the book that the great dangers they would face if the artifact was placed on top of the mountain.\r\n\r\nThe two met the sage eye-leveled long before he was able to reach the mountain top, after a great battle, the leader finally won the last fight by shooting an arrow, fatally wounding the sage, but as a last act of defiance, he used the artifacts powers, splitting the mountain in half, killing the leader, but also almost fatally wounding S&igrave;th in the process.\r\n---\r\n_&quot;It&#039;s been a long time since then, I&#039;ve fully recovered by now, the only difference now from back then, is that I&#039;m **bloodthirsty** and in dire need of *revenge*.&quot;_ - S&igrave;th","replies":[{"poster":"Sylpharion","date":"2015-09-30T17:30:49.833+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Just letting you know, for some reason the blockquote isn't working so the > isn't meant to be like that, it was meant to be the coding for blockquote.","replies":[]}]}
