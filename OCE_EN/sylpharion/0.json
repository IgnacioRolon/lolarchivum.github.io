With Zyra hardly being played anywhere near the lower meta and mainly as support and Nidalee played only AP thanks to the AD Nidalee nerfs makes both of them not as fearful as they could be.\r\n\r\n**Nidalee:**\r\n\r\nIf it's a good Nidalee then you don't have to worry about anything, the damage on her is amazing and she can shred tanks. But during the late game, Nidalee's Bushwack really is nothing more but a scouting tool or a ward. I was thinking of this while playing a game of Nidalee, no I did not lose, yes I won mercilessly, but I had a huge problem with rewarding myself as Nidalee. Hitting a few spears and then executing the kill in Cougar form is what makes her so deadly, but I wanted her W to be just a tad more useful than it is already.\r\n\r\n**Javelin Toss:**\r\n\r\nCurrent : \r\n\r\nACTIVE: Nidalee hurls her javelin forward in a line, dealing magic damage to the first enemy it hits.\r\nBASE MAGIC DAMAGE: 50 / 75 / 100 / 125 / 150 (+40% AP)\r\nAfter having traveled 525 units, the javelin's damage will be increase by 2% per 7.75 units traveled, capping at 200% bonus damage (300% total damage) after traveling 1300 units.\r\nMAXIMUM MAGIC DAMAGE: 150 / 225 / 300 / 375 / 450 (+120% AP)\r\n\r\nChange:\r\n\r\nACTIVE: Nidalee hurls her javelin forward in a line, dealing magic damage to the first enemy it hits.\r\nBASE MAGIC DAMAGE: 65 / 70 / 75 / 80 / 85  (+45% AP)\r\nAfter having traveled 525 units, the javelin's damage will be increase by 2% per 7.75 units traveled, capping at 200% bonus damage (300% total damage) after traveling 1300 units.\r\nMAXIMUM MAGIC DAMAGE: 195 / 210 / 225 / 240 / 255 (+135% AP)\r\n\r\nThis is a ratio buff on Nidalee, this gives her late game more shredding power bu making it so it's harder to get the necessary ability power in the early / mid game. Making her more feared in the late game, rather than just being a nuisance with her spears and traps. Also with the bonus damage buff from her W, the damage nerfs on her Q means nothing to the damage she's getting.\r\n\r\n**Takedown**\r\n\r\nUnchanged\r\n\r\n**Bushwack**\r\n\r\nCurrent :\r\n\r\nACTIVE: Nidalee lays a trap at a target location that arms after a very brief delay. When sprung by an enemy unit, they will take magic damage plus a percentage of their current health over 4 seconds (max. damage 150 vs. monsters). Traps last for 2 minutes.\r\nTOTAL MAGIC DAMAGE: 20 / 40 / 60 / 80 / 100 (+10 / 12 / 14 / 16 / 18% (+ 2% per 100 AP) of target's current health)\r\n\r\nChange: (Name Change)\r\n\r\nPASSIVE: Nidalee enchants her spear, causing her auto attacks to deal bonus base damage and her Javelin Toss to deal bonus magic damage plus a percentage of their current health over 2 seconds. (max. 300 vs monsters). \r\n\r\nAA BASE DAMAGE: 8 / 11 / 14 / 17 / 20 (+ 1 per 150 AP) (This damage applies to turrets and structures as well.)\r\n\r\nJAVELIN TOSS BONUS DAMAGE: 10 / 20 / 30 / 40 / 50 (+ 1 per 50 AP) + 3 / 4 / 5 / 6 / 7% of the targets current health. (+ 1% per 100 AP)\r\n\r\nACTIVE: Nidalee magically creates a trap using vines and leaves. When sprung by an enemy unit, they will take magic damage and be snared for 1 second.\r\n\r\nThat was all I had in mind for Nidalee, I know buffs will come with nerfs as is. But I hope it will at least create discussion among players, Nidalee really needs something to give her the extra Umph she needs. Also I forgot to add on Javelin Toss, to increase it's Width by 10, it just slides pass people when they're right next to it. Really unfair, while Mundo's Cleaver hits me like a Morgana Bind. :l Really Rito ?\r\n-\r\n--\r\n\r\n**Zyra:**\r\n\r\nBy the way, I don't know if there's a bug with her plants but they're really glitchy and sometimes just stand still instead of auto attacking if Zyra stands still. Gotta fix this, and if you changed this on purpose... Literally it, she could use a movement speed buff for her base movement speed and inside her ultimate. Her passive could give her passive effects depending on the amount of plants she summoned like Yorick. Maybe CDR, Shred Armor / MR / Health / Mana?, MV, AD, AP. Anything tbh.\r\n\r\n(Forgot what I was gonna say on Zyra, so really lazy.

Also giving her bonus %hp damage on autos and spears... your joking. AD Nidalee would be incredibly OP and you would also bring back the non-counter play cancer of face meltingly strong spears she can hurl from miles away\n> \n>  champions are supposed to have weaknesses.\n\nYes, in the current meta she can be a total bully. But what happens if she loses lane? Or goes against someone who can completely destroy her.\nYes she has weaknesses, but it's too much. Being almost useless in teamfights makes it so she can only pick people off once her team has died off or enemies getting caught off, seeing this Bushwack being a snare would be even more rewarding for Nidalee, though I don't necessarily agree with the health shred, it should at least be an armor / mr shred or give Javelin Toss and her AA's more damage so if she is feared of going into close range, she is still able to dish out some damage with her auto attacks. \n\nWhat I think would be nice on Javelin Toss, is if it doesn't exceed her auto attack ranged to gain any bonus damage on the spear, it should shred health or armor and magic resist.\n\n---\n\nSide Note, with the Morello play style instead of Athene's, Nidalee is easily popped but most champions.\nFizz is someone who will definitely win in the laning phase from his Grevious Wounds and invulnerability, able to dodge her E (strongest cougar ability, other than q) or both W / E if played correctly. He can also dodge spears about she has jumped on him and Hunted is gone.\n\nKassadin is also a total bully when it comes to going against Nidalee, he will force her out of lane and with jungler ganks, she will die if she does not back.\n\nZed, who is one of the most played champs in the mid lane can completely wreck her, regardless. Unless she has her jungler coming or she has Zhonya's, then she'll be on the smallest slither of health.\n\nOrianna, a champ who some people have been seen running Morello instead of Athene's can also destroy Nidalee. Nidalee pounces? Well lemme just proc my shield, Q + W + R. Since Orianna will most definitely outpoke Nidalee if she doesn't land her spears, and her crazy damage can also just slap the kitty kat out of Nidalee.\n\nAhri, another champion who not tends to rush Morello. A good Ahri, underline good, will know Nidalee's pounce if she does. Ult to the side, charm and proceed with her combo. Using the 2 charges of her ultimate left, she can either ignite and finish her off or leave Nidalee running with her tail tucked in her legs.\n\nThese are just 5, but there are a lot more.\n\nYes I know, if Nidalee pokes enough she can just Pounce / E / Q or Pounce / Q and kill them. But what if she can't get it off, what if they push and her jungler is unable to execute a gank. I know I'm putting these champions in a 1 v 1 situation where the fights tide can turn, but generally speaking. Without any help and not knowing how good both the players are it can be difficult to evaluate. Though Nidalee can turn the fights to previous poking, some champions can escape too easily or just sustain, survive and poke her down. (Orianna + Zed), in some situations they can even 1 : 1 like some Akali's do.\n\nAnd because if she cannot land her spears during the laning phase she should have bonus damage on her basic attacks, and reward Nidalee's for actually being able to land them.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"IngÃ©nue","date":"2014-12-16T01:20:56.373+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Nidalee is strong enough as it is.

She's easily popped but Zed, Fizz, Talon, Kassadin. Anyone with a gap closer, and in the support her peel is weak and her ultimate is wasted for teamfights. If her passive could be more useful it'd be nice, giving her a buff.\n\nAzir has a much better denial, so does Zed with his shadow. Zyra should be feared of Zed if he puts out his shadow instead of trying to deny his farm, jumping to shadow then Q / E could cause Zyra to E / Q / R, but a click of the ult can change it all and also killing her.\n\nOrianna with her ball, and Syndra with the positioning for her Q for E stun.\n\nAkali with her W, a lot of champions that are top tier at the moment can much, much stronger than Zyra in the mid lane.\nThough a well timed Plant + Q / E can stop skill shots in the bot / mid lane, her only place that she can really play comfortably in is the bot lane, and still, she's either too squishy too easily popped or situations where she just can't escape.","replies":[]}]}]}
