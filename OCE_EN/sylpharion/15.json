Players in the high tier know the potential dangers of Gragas and stay too far away from his ultimate, only ever allowing him to ult in teamfights which might be a bad or great idea.\r\n2. Players in lower tier, either ult them to the wrong place and never get them inside the barrel either being too far away from the barrel, or simply just right next to it but not in the AoE.\r\n\r\nFor his ultimate I think they could add the a huge circle around Gragas' ult to show how far they are going to be knocked back, like Vayne's E.\r\nIt would also be a nice to do it to Tristana and Lee Sin, showing how far the target is going to be knocked back.\r\nI'm not sure if Gragas' ult makes them knock just around the radius of his ultimate or beyond that, if they are further away but they should do something so that people getting to know Gragas know where they are going to land, I'm not sure how it'd work since they get knocked back depending on how far they are ( I think ).\r\n\r\nCurrent:\r\nMAGIC DAMAGE: 200 / 300 / 400 (+ 70% AP)\r\n\r\nPrefer:\r\nMAGIC DAMAGE: 250 / 400 / 550 (+ 55% AP) OR MAGIC DAMAGE: 200 / 275 / 350 (+ 80% AP) OR 250 / 375 / 500 (+ 60% AP)\r\n\r\nI'm really just coming up with a lot of numbers for Gragas and I think the last one works the best, it gives him more early game damage if he's rushing sustain rather than pure ability power, and just raw power if his going tank, bruiser or Lady Gragas in the Jangle.\r\n\r\nI know if Riot did this, there would be a lot of nerfs to his W and E to compensate, but I think these fairly small changes don't really need any changing to compensate, except maybe making his E 50 / 100 / 150 / 200 / 250 and his W have no base damage, just % but with a 45% AP Ratio from 30%.\r\n\r\nI really, really don't know but that's why I'm making a discussion, please tell me what you think below. Also please keep it friendly, no arguments, just debating and seeing what works else best. Hope a Rito member comments **IF** this gets popular.","replies":[{"poster":"Zaps","date":"2014-12-08T07:55:39.788+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'm not from the game balance / clarity parts of Riot - or anywhere related to that, so this post is only my own personal feelings as a player! \n\nAs a pretty heavy support player, I wonder if raw-damage based changes like that would actually make Support-Gragas pretty strong, especially building a tanky-ish build with Haunting Guise. This could be a good thing, but something to consider! \n\nI like the idea of the secondary large circle to show the knockback, but I could see it also being confusing to new players, expecting that that second AoE would also be taking damage.","replies":[{"poster":"Sylpharion","date":"2014-12-10T05:12:05.444+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Omg a senpai noticed me ","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Sylpharion","date":"2014-12-07T01:25:14.231+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Did I post this in the wrong section ?
