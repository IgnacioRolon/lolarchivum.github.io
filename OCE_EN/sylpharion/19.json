You don&#039;t have to read it but it&#039;d be nice if you&#039;d check them all out just so I could get a few views. I don&#039;t like drawing since I think I&#039;m horrible but I do post drawings every so often.\n\nI do a lot of narrative writing and poems... yeah that&#039;s all.\nThe story isn't completed and this is all the chapters I have so far, I update from multiple times a day to once every 1 - 2 days. \n\nLINKS :\n\nhttp://sylpharie.deviantart.com/\n\nhttp://sylpharie.deviantart.com/journal/Se7en-PROLOGUE-Temperance-530957976\nhttp://sylpharie.deviantart.com/journal/Se7en-PROLOGUE-Wrath-531137229\nhttp://sylpharie.deviantart.com/journal/Se7en-PROLOGUE-Lust-531298959\nhttp://sylpharie.deviantart.com/journal/Se7en-PROLOGUE-Kindness-531350149\nhttp://sylpharie.deviantart.com/journal/Se7en-PROLOGUE-Chastity-531319118\nhttp://sylpharie.deviantart.com/journal/Se7en-PROLOGUE-Vanity-531499510\nhttp://sylpharie.deviantart.com/journal/Se7en-PROLOGUE-Greed-531895676","replies":[{"poster":"TouchMyKimchi","date":"2015-05-09T01:29:07.439+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"***","replies":[{"poster":"Sylpharion","date":"2015-05-09T02:34:28.319+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=TouchMyKimchi,realm=OCE,application-id=Ntey9fRZ,discussion-id=E4HEP0sr,comment-id=0000,timestamp=2015-05-09T01:29:07.439+0000)\n>\n> Pi ss off you Nonce.\n> \n> How does this garbage pass as being remotely league related?\n\nWell this is MISC. so it doesn't have to be League related or else it would put down by now by the moderators / rioters.\nIt's not meant to be pass as League related hence the term OFF TOPIC. Well, instead of saying garbage give me something insightful like where I did wrong. Don't go playing a bronze game, raging. coming here and letting off your steam. No needs to be your scratching board when you're angry.","replies":[]}]}]}
