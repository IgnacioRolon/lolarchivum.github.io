If she is close enough to her target, she is able to hit the / those target(s) with a total of 4 times but take 50% less damage from the last.\n\n>Cast Range: 800\nSlash Radius: 400\nSlow: 35% for 2 seconds\nDamage: 70 / 90 / 110 / 130 / 150 (+50% of AD & 40% of AP)\nMax Damage: 140 / 180 / 220 / 260 / 300 (+100% of AD & 75% of AP)\nCooldown: 10 / 9.5 / 9 / 8.5 / 8\n\n**W:** Virtual Nightmare\nNyx calls forth a line of shadows stunning all enemies hit, during the next 3 seconds if she re-activates the ability to consume 35 Pride, a giant cone of bats burst forth from the area that the shadows previously were and fears enemies.\n\n>Range: 700\nDiameter: 400\nStun: 1.3 seconds\nDamage: 50 / 90 / 130 / 170 / 210 (+55% of AP)\nFear: .7 second\nSecondary Damage: 0 / 10 / 20 / 30 / 40 (+35% of AP)\nCooldown: 12 / 11.25 / 10.50 / 9.75 / 9\n\n**E:** Assault\nNyx dashes forward (able to go through walls) towards her cursor and goes invisible for a short duration. For the next few seconds, if she attacks an enemy unit, she causes them to take bonus damage and have reduced resistances for a few seconds. If she kills an enemy champion the cooldown is reset, killing enemy minions or neutral monsters will reduce the cooldown. She can consume 35 to instantly reduce the cooldown, have a longer invisibility duration and increased movement speed while stealth.\n\n>Dash Range: 350\nBonus Damage: 20 / 40 / 60 / 80 / 120 (+25% of AP)\nResistance Reduction: Armor / MR by 20% for 2 seconds\nStealth Duration: 1 second (+1)\nMovement Speed: 35%\nCooldown: 6 (-50% of Current Cooldown)\n\n\n**R:** Extend / Assassinate\nNyx gains bonus attack range.\n>Bonus Range: 75 / 150 / 225 (+ 125 Melee Range)\n\nNyx dashes (teleports) behind the enemy champion and slashes them dealing a base damage plus a percentage of the target&#039;s missing health.\nIf the enemy champion dies this ability cooldown is refreshed and she gains pride.\n\n>Cast Range: 1100\nDamage: 150 / 225 / 300 (+50% of AP) + 9 / 11 / 13% of Missing Health\nCooldown: 95 / 80 / 65\nRequirement: Must have 10 or less Pride.\n(This is quite hard if you look at how much Pride her abilities cost.)","replies":[{"poster":"kJs","date":"2015-03-26T16:32:36.750+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I keep seeing this hero from Dota 2. http://dota2.gamepedia.com/Nyx_Assassin?cookieSetup=true","replies":[{"poster":"Aedridon","date":"2015-03-26T23:24:42.341+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yeah and smite alr has nyx.

Names don't mean anything, a name good mean a name. I could name my child Felicity and she could be the most awful, most negative child in the whole world. Names don't define a champion even if it's meant to, I don't see people trying to define Kalista's name like 'Kalista means to be beautiful or the most beautiful but she looks like a wretched hag.'","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Sylpharion","date":"2015-03-28T02:45:58.487+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Wanna try leaving something actually useful so I can improve on?
