I got into Silver 2 promos (If I win I get back into Silver 1) - Went 2-1 - Lost the first and won the next two and I'm still in Silver 2 with 100 lp  with no wins or loses, even though it said I was promoted.

If so, what does it say your ranking is in the post-game lobby? Could just be that the League ladder hasn't updated, which is reasonable. Another game should really fix it if it's that.","replies":[]}]}
