She breached the surface of the ocean&#039;s vast expanse to pursue a favourite hobby of hers; stargazing between the sea and sky. Nami smiled as she viewed the familiar blanket of the night stretching endlessly above, its countless points of light uninterrupted in the absence of the moon. She found peace floating there, cushioned between a beautiful view and the relative comfort of the surrounding waters. The tide gently carried her along as she relaxed, the bright galaxy keeping her mind at ease for quite some time. But her beloved tide brought her to a place where the scent of danger was rife in the salted air. \nTurning and submerging all but her eyes within the cover of the dark waters she sighted a shoreline; she was close to a Valoran beach. The Marai frowned trying to make out the scene unfolding before her.\nAll along the beach shadowy creatures were bursting out of the sands, each emanating a sinister presence that made Nami&#039;s skin crawl. Every one of them rushed towards five shining figures, streaks and flashes of colour flowing from the dazzling beings. \nSwimming closer the young Marai felt no threat from the five, and a sense of awe at their powers and gorgeous looks, but she didn&#039;t know if they would hold out against the waves of monsters that came their way. She gripped her staff tightly beneath the water&#039;s surface.\nTwo of the humans appeared to be flying, one sending shots of blue in quick succession toward their foes, the other showering down green starlike streams and bathing her allies in similar light. Nami saw her magic healing the wounds that any stray creature inflicted, and she decided that the strange girl was very important in their efforts. Almost as soon as the Tidecaller had noted such, she saw a dark fin rise out of the sand not too far behind the healer. As if by instinct Nami leapt from the sea with her staff raised high. Her usual Tidecalling magic felt different; a flash of bright aqua pulsed from the top of her staff and seemed to flow through her. Nami&#039;s body changed, glittering like the cosmos in that aqua hue, star ornaments appearing on her body and hair-like head fins. She sensed the familiar presence of the pearl that protected her ocean home and saw a pearlescent seahorse manifest from her staff. Despite the obvious newness of her form she knew what she was capable of. \nThe incoming shadow creature let free a horrifying scream as it launched from the sand towards the green haired girl... But it was trapped mid air in an aqua bubble. The Star Guardian of the Tides, Nami, directed a stream of star-ridden water from the ocean to smack into the beast. The other Star Guardians gazed upon her in surprise, but quickly registered her as an ally and returned to their battle. Nami aided them, sending more streams of bright aqua onto the beach, bouncing them off enemies and allies alike. The waters did not hurt the other Guardians, but rather refreshed them and renewed their vigor against the waves of monsters. Her seahorse familiar jumped to them from time to time, empowering their attacks.\nAn alarming rumbling sound began as the sands became crazily unstable and the largest amount yet of shadow monsters rose up from below. Seeing the group completely swarmed Nami focused everything into the tides around her. She lifted an immense sheet of water, forming the most brilliantly shining tidal wave she&#039;d ever seen before crashing it down upon the beach. The tumultuous wave harmlessly passed her allies, but it wrecked enormous damage to the forces of darkness. As the tides swept back to the sea she saw the threat gone, and one of the Guardians approached her. She too had a strangeness to her, foxlike features and a vulpine familiar floating above her upturned palm.\n&quot;Thanks for the help, umm..?&quot; \n&quot;Tidecaller Nami.&quot; The young Marai replied. \nThe blonde beauty nodded an affirmation before returning the exchange with her own name. &quot;Ahri.&quot; She said simply, and added, &quot;I don&#039;t mean to cut this short, mermaid girl, but we got places to be. Star Guardians don&#039;t get the luxury of breaks when there&#039;s a universe to protect.&quot;\nNami wasn&#039;t sure she liked the nickname or the girl&#039;s informality, but she nodded all the same. She felt within herself that she too had a world to protect, and that her people could be in danger in the near future. \nThe bright posse of Guardians began to leave, and Nami prepared herself to dive back into the seas. But the green haired girl approached her. \n&quot;I appreciate you saving me,&quot; she told her in a soft voice. &quot;My name is Soraka. I let you know now that you will not always be alone. Farewell, Nami, and lead strong.&quot;\nThe gentle girl spread her angelic wings and flew back to her teammates, but the warmth of her words remained. With newfound determination and her little seahorse by her side, the Tidecaller made for home. \n\n {{champion:267}} End ~","replies":[]}
