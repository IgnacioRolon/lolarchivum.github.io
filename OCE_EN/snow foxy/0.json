Nightmarish monsters rampant in the city, bright lights and glittering outfits&hellip; It was such a headache. Yes, Kayn had been chosen to work alongside the Star Guardians.\r\n Why me? He had hissed at his newfound companion through gritted teeth. The ethereal talking scythe had responded by telling him his rough past made him perfect for the role, and that his destiny was written in the stars. Kayn wanted to puke.  \r\nTossing his ponytail in an irritated manner the young man set out into the school yard, avoiding eye contact with any of the other students in their social gatherings for lunch time. He made his way to his usual place, a secluded spot at the edge of the grounds where most didn&rsquo;t bother to trouble him in any way. But today was apparently not going his way as upon reaching the circle of trees he saw Zed&rsquo;s girlfriend, Syndra, waiting for him. \r\n It had been embarrassing enough for Syndra to tell his senior idol that he was now a Star Guardian just like her, to which he was sure was met with snickering, but it annoyed him more that she was here in his spot. \r\n &ldquo;What do you want?&rdquo; He asked, not kindly. He leaned back against a tree trunk, folding his arms. Syndra gave a curt smile. \r\n&ldquo;Of all people, why do you get to wield the literal most power?&rdquo; She wondered, envy clear in her tone. &ldquo;What are you but a lone wolf with a history of getting into messes?&rdquo;\r\n Kayn rolled his eyes. &ldquo;I have no time for petty conversation, Syndra. I&rsquo;ve got some strategy to talk over, unlike you.&rdquo; \r\nShe narrowed her eyes at him, but didn&rsquo;t shoot back a response as his backpack began to glow. The source of the light floated free of the material and formed itself into the giant glowing scythe that they knew as the First Star. \r\nRestricted to his power being utilised through others, the First Star had had to seek out Kayn to join the mortal realm and carry out his desires. Although he promised his only objective was to vanquish the dark monsters invading the planet, Kayn heavily suspected an ulterior motive. One that wasn&rsquo;t entirely as pure and good as the Star promoted, because he knew as part of his contract to the First Star that he would somewhat fuse with his body, due to the vast discrepancy of their magical powers. It was entirely a possibility that the First Star wanted to use Kayn as a vessel to remain on Earth and do as he so willed, and the teenager in turn hoped to overcome the Star for the same purpose.  \r\n&ldquo;Syndra, do not question my authority nor decisions.&rdquo; The Star said to the long haired young woman. She sighed.\r\n &ldquo;Yes Dad.&rdquo; She said in a sarcastic tone. The scythe ignored her and continued. &ldquo;You have your own place in the future of this planet, your own responsibility. Do not waste my gifts to you.&rdquo;\r\n Syndra remained in silence after that, but her body language showed that of an oppressed child who had just been lectured by her mother. \r\nKayn picked up First Star and moved further away from Syndra, looking at the weapon. \r\n &ldquo;It comes tonight, doesn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo; He asked impatiently. Ever eager to be in combat again despite the downsides of feeling like a fashion fairy he needed to know.\r\n\r\n\r\nAgainst the massive hulking forms of the Dark Heralds he found the First Star&rsquo;s predictions to be true. He whirled and slashed, weaving a dervish dance of light through his opponents. Kayn&rsquo;s and the Star&rsquo;s power combined created a trail of gold magic, the same gold that trimmed his black and white uniform. It smited the demons, burning through them like molten fire and leaving ashes in their wake. \r\nAn ear piercing scream invoked terror into the Star Guardians as their newest adversary announced itself - one of the legendary Void Wyrms, the biggest they&rsquo;d ever seen. \r\nKayn fearlessly charged forward, a role model for his fellow Guardians as he stole initiative from the adrenaline coursing through his veins. He fought the monstrosity with everything he had, fuelled by his determination to pass every obstacle, wanting to prove himself. It was an awe inspiring sight, till the beast changed. Evolving mid combat it grew massive insect-like wings, and the spines upon its back elongated. As Kayn leapt forward once again to engage the demonic creature it beat its wings harshly, throwing him back with a gale of wind created by the sheer force of its movements. It then threw volleys of spear sized sharp spines toward the group, new ones growing in their place for each assault. Janna, Lulu and Lux combined had trouble blocking the missiles with their shields - there were simply too many to focus on. Soraka was forced to stay right back so she could heal her fellow Guardians without being in danger, her skills absolutely vital to this battle. But gradually they were beginning to lose. Kayn could feel the urgency, feel them running out of time. He knew it was up to him to pull through. With a powerful leap he rushed for the Wyrm&rsquo;s head, cleaving through the inevitable battering winds as it attempted to knock him away. It didn&rsquo;t go to plan, however, as the massive Void creature slammed its head into him, its thick chitin stopping First Star before Kayn could reach any vitals and the size and weight of the Wyrm hitting him like a train. Gasping in pain he fell, feeling himself blacking out for a moment. It was then that he felt like he was losing his mind and identity, the violently bright light within him overcoming his vision, burning&hellip; He screamed anger at the First Star internally. Determination took hold of everything he was. \r\n&ldquo;I will not become your shell!&rdquo; He raged, his adrenaline kicking into overdrive. &ldquo;I will not lose to you!&rdquo;\r\n The Wyrm then swallowed the conflicted Star Guardian whole. As the girls, and Ezreal, gasped in despair, the dark monster rose up to its full height and set its gaze back upon them. Before it could even resume its assault upon the glowing ensemble a loud war cry emitted from within the beast, and Kayn&rsquo;s scythe tore through in a clean cleave that separated its upper torso from the rest of its body. He shone there, incredibly bright, the golden magic almost too blinding to upon. Carrying His scythe, turning to face His team; the First Star was no more. He was in control now.","replies":[{"poster":"David257","date":"2017-10-07T19:07:32.327+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I liked kayn since he was released and I always thought an sg skin would be fitting for him.
