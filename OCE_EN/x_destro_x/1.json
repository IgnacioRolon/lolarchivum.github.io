Yes youll get bad team mates but if you think you're that good then PROVE IT IN THE GAME!, Dont blame other people .. Bloody hell the worst thing about these forums is people complaining their team is bad, Yes it has 50% of that is the problem but you are the other 50%, \n\nIF YOU HATE RIOT DONT PLAY.
