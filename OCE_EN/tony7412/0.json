Basically all the new champs have a flash or a jump-type move now that helps them move so much better, whether that be to escape or chase. I can only think of Shaco&#039;s Deceive and Kat&#039;s blinky movey thingy from the old champs.\r\nAnyway, but unfair and I think something needs to be done.\r\nLoved to proven wrong or otherwise.\r\nDiscuss ;)","replies":[{"poster":"Lord Sesshomaru","date":"2016-06-13T22:40:22.226+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Define 'new' champions, do you mean this year? or the last 5 champions? or this year and last year?\n\nThe champions released this year Jhin, Aurelion Sol, Taliyah, are all champions that are based around map control. Sol and Taliyah are built around their ability to roam, Twisted Fate (one of the oldest champions in the game) shares this feature. But just like Twisted Fate, Sol and Taliyah lack any form of movement ability while actually in combat (because taking damage re-sets Aurelion Sol's E, and reset's the cooldown on Taliyah's passive, not to mention you cant travel on her ult if you take damage.) The only mobility Taliyah has in combat is the slight movement speed buff she gets if she stands on worked ground, the problem is, she deals significantly less damage when attacking from worked ground, so she has to choose between movement speed and damage while in combat. \n\nJhin lacks any dash/gap-closer abilities whatsoever, but you don't need gap closers when half your abilities reach from bot lane halfway to the mid lane. Jhin is like Draven in the sense that he relies on short bursts of movement speed after attacking to escape trouble, they also have map control ultimates. (Draven is an old champion) \n\nIllaoi is a newish champ, and i don't believe she has any mobility abilities at all... not even a movement speed boost. \n\nKindred is one of the 'newish' champions, Her Q gives her a little dash, but if she uses it while inside her W, she can use it many times. This is no different to Vayne, Vayne's Q is almost exactly the same as Kindred's Q, and when vayne has her ult activated she can also use her Q in quick succession, (not to mention that unlike Kindred, Vayne actually turns invisible while doing so). (Vayne is an old champion)\n\nNot to mention that Kassadin (an old champion) essentially has a flash every 2 seconds, and can move through units. Im pretty sure that you CANNOT get more mobile than that. \n\n**TL;DR: Taliyah and Sol are only mobile on a global scale (travelling across the map) but not on smaller scales (fighting, chasing, escaping) just like Twisted Fate. Jhin has no more mobility than Draven, Kindred is the same as Vayne, Illaoi has nothing, and tons of older champions (Kassadin included) are far more mobile than anyone mentioned here. **","replies":[{"poster":"Corehog","date":"2016-06-14T06:27:46.399+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'm pretty sure Illaoi's W allows her to jump over a wall(?), but it's a very short distance like Graves or Lucian dash.","replies":[{"poster":"Lord Sesshomaru","date":"2016-06-14T06:41:25.607+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"It's targetable and can only engage, so you cant choose the direction of it unlike graves/lucian. \n\nBut i guess it does count you're right.","replies":[{"poster":"Corehog","date":"2016-06-14T07:08:10.098+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"You're absolutely right.\n\nI should of compared it to a Katarina or Jax jump than a Lucian or Graves dash.","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Oprah Windfurry","date":"2016-06-13T20:52:43.900+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Jax has a jump, ez has arcane shift, xin has a dash, panth has his jump, naut can hook to a wall, lee can dash, mu can bandage toss, ahri ult and q gives mobility, cait has net, graves has dash and ult can create distance, blitz can speed up, zilean can speed up or slow down, karma can speed up.
