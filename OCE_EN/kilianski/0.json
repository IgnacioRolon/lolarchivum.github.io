Seriously the new leaver buster system is just focused on North American Server where the Elites live. Poor Oceania people need to have their leaver buster punishment reduced. Riot too stingy to afford good server. Riots has to start writing good codes to help maintain a healthy internet connection with the New Zealand Internet Service providers.\n\nYOUR CUSTOMERS ARE TRYING TO MAINTAIN HEALTHY RELATIONSHIP, BUT YOU JUST PUNISH THEM FOR BY HANDING OUT SWEET LEAVERBUSTER 20MINS WAITING QUEUE.\n\nGOOD JOB RIOT.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Kilianski","date":"2015-02-03T10:11:31.422+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yeah, exactly.
