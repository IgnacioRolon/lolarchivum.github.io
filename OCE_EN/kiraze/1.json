I shouldn't bother asking because  all you do is spread hate on this community. The person who needs to get a life is you. Cleary you need something better to do. Animals get restless when they are bored you know? Go get yourself a new chew toy.","replies":[{"poster":"WEETBIX 4 BREKKI","date":"2015-04-19T02:54:08.898+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"***","replies":[{"poster":"Kiraze","date":"2015-04-19T03:07:41.462+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=WEETBIX 4 BREKKI,realm=OCE,application-id=Ntey9fRZ,discussion-id=fM7Xioiw,comment-id=000000000000,timestamp=2015-04-19T02:54:08.898+0000)\n>\n> Sorry it took you 2 years to work out the meta :-) I forgot the human brain differs from person to person.\n\nSorry but I don't intend to entertain your kind. I regret even acknowledging your existance. And before I go, just like to tell you that I wasn't even the least mad at your statement on the meta. I'm mad at your \"contribution\" to the league board.

Do I sound serious to you? What if all this was a joke to make you mad.\n\nEdit: Also consider getting into diamond again before talking shit here (totally a joke) because there's absolutely no point boasting about your past rank. And if you say it isn't hard (because it really isn't) then get it. \n\nI call it tank meta because on average, 3/5 champions in one team are going tank. Top/Jg/Support. You don't see a nuking jarvan or master yi jungle as often anymore. Top bans? Nautilus, Sejuani, Gragas. And like I said, I've never had issues melting tanks. Now I have to melt 3.
