It could have just been League as a game, because the only depressing thing in it is Amumu. But even then, it's endearing.\n\nIs it because of the shockingly bad community? Just remember that in the moment of the game, people forget that they're talking to other people, and often when they're mad at the game they'll lash out at the players.\n\nThere is always a way out of depression.","replies":[{"poster":"Chesse Blob","date":"2015-04-22T12:14:20.086+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It is because players abuse others and I dont talk much in chat making them mad at me. Also I just nerver get support so yea.OH btw my type of depression is major depression\n....","replies":[{"poster":"HORSE OF FORCE","date":"2015-04-23T09:25:04.551+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Do you mean support as in emotional and physical support or the support role in a game of League?\n\nJokes aside, you can always get support. You're in OCE, so I'll presume you're in Australia at the least. You can venture to http://au.reachout.com/ for practical advice on a wide variety of topics, including depression. One major thing it suggests for you to do is to talk to someone. If there's no one immediately and personally available, you can go to your GP about it.\n\nAnd I stress this again, talking to others is really important. Not only to reflect on yourself and what you've done but to see what others think of it. Please do not take the social interaction you see in public League games deter you from this experience. Most people don't realise that they're talking to other human beings, and not just robots. Remember, there is a reporting system built into the game.\n\nThe least you can do, probably, is to take a long break from playing League. The game itself puts its players in quite a stressful situation (performance affects outcome and chance of winning, other players must depend on each other, complicated set-ups, map awareness, objective control, etc.) so naturally it will bring out the worst in people. If you absolutely must play League then play a game where the first thing you do upon entering is to mute everyone.\n\nBest of luck.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"TO VALHALLA","date":"2015-04-22T03:34:12.836+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Must be the community. I suggest you quit the game OR when you join the game mute everyone. Are you depressed that you're losing or?? Just remember this is a computer game and shouldn't make you feel depressed.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Chesse Blob","date":"2015-04-19T12:19:17.629+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"And yes I have tried 3 suicide attempts so yea...","replies":[]}]}
