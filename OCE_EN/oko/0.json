I am unable to revoke the invite as it states that they are not part of my club and cannot be removed.

Unfortunately there is no way for them to remove it for you, however as a club owner or officer you should be able to revoke the invite yourself.\n\nScroll down to the bottom of your club chat and you should see the list of pending invites, right click on the summoner and select \"Revoke\".\n\nIf the above doesn't work, try making someone else in your club an officer and seeing if they can revoke the invite.\nIf neither you or one of your officers are able to revoke the invite we're going to need a screenshot of the error you're receiving for further investigation.","replies":[{"poster":"Oko","date":"2016-04-11T11:10:08.374+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Seems to have resolved itself after the patch.
