She&#039;s in practically every game. I have friends around and we play ARAMs overnight to see Lux, Lux, Lux endlessly. I had one game just tonight where I rerolled out of Lux out of annoyance of seeing her again, to see the enemy team then rerolled into Lux.\r\n\r\nIt&#039;s getting beyond a joke. It&#039;s as if there&#039;s a select little list of champions you see in almost every ARAM, like they have higher odds or something. My buddies and I own all the champs but it&#039;s basically guaranteed that we&#039;ll see Lux or Ziggs on our team. How?\r\n\r\n{{champion:99}}  &lt;- Why have you skewed the code to keep this face in every game, Rito?","replies":[{"poster":"SephirothSG","date":"2016-03-24T23:44:36.946+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey there,\n\nThis would be better suited for the [Misc](http://boards.oce.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/miscellaneous) or [Gameplay & Strategy](http://boards.oce.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/gameplay-strategy) boards, this board is for help & support with technical issues.\n\nAlthough I don't see lux often in ARAM, however it's possible the reason you're running into her more often than other champs is she's relatively cheap compared to other champs.","replies":[]}]}
