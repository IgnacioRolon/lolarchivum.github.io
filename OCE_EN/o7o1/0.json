So no voting or paying etc, just a steady rotation of different skins each time you play. It could even be like a rare occurrence, like 80% of games have the normal Rift skin, and 20% of the time is on a random Rift skin. Would certainly make those game special.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Omni Presents","date":"2015-09-09T11:59:24.568+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"They can make champion skins, they should be able to make any skins.\n\nThat means if we can import our own skins and have our own screen display something else, than why can't we create our own map skins and at least have something to look at on our screen?","replies":[{"poster":"JasonWazza","date":"2015-09-09T13:09:18.950+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Which people do, hence the fan made chroma packs that are actually decent.","replies":[{"poster":"Omni Presents","date":"2015-09-09T14:57:59.311+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Ok there is that, but why can't we the fans make map skins?","replies":[{"poster":"JasonWazza","date":"2015-09-09T17:28:40.749+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Because that would require hours of man work time at the very least.\n\nChamp skins take maybe 10-30 minutes.","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Klavinmour","date":"2015-09-09T14:49:13.994+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"One of the reasons for the HUGE SR overhaul was that it would be easier to create skins for the map, such as the good ol' Christmas skin.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Essembie","date":"2015-09-09T12:04:41.324+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Not a bad idea.
