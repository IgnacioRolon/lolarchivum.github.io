I can do it this time&rdquo;. \r\n\r\nShe restarts the procedure. She&rsquo;s made herself do this a countless amount of times, all ending the same way; failure. \r\nShe lifts her right leg up, balancing on her left. She steadily takes another breath. Now, the tricky part. \r\nShe closes her eyes and stresses her calm face. \r\n\r\n&ldquo;I can do this!&rdquo; She whispers to herself. \r\n\r\nOne large shard begins to race around her begin to float, she slightly opens an eye. \r\n\r\n&ldquo;Errrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr another failure!&rdquo; She complains. \r\n\r\nShe goes out of sync, throwing the rock she ripped from the ground off the mountain ledge. \r\nThe mountain walls around her still remained untouched by her magic, the ground was shredded of stone. \r\nShe takes another deep breath. \r\n\r\n&ldquo;Come on Taliyah, this is no reason to whine.&rdquo; She lectures herself. \r\n&ldquo;What would Master Yasuo say?&rdquo; \r\nShe stares off the ledge into Shurima&rsquo;s corrupt kingdom from the Great Barrier. \r\n\r\n&ldquo;What would he say&hellip;?&rdquo; Taliyah ponders. \r\nShe pulls out her small, crimson journal from her time with him, flicking through the parched pages&hellip; \r\n**~~-----------------------~~**\r\nShe remembers her months with the drunkly wise samurai in Ionia. Her struggles to even control a pebble with her will. \r\nYasuo told her he&rsquo;d seen her control the problematic rock in her sleep while he was on lookout, \r\nhe&rsquo;d said the mountains would shift whenever Taliyah would try relax on the unmovable earth. \r\nShe remembers the meditating the two did together, \r\nby the end she would be on a rough raised platform that she had no clue she&rsquo;d made. \r\nShe&#039;d learnt to force the ground upwards with his guidance. \r\nShe can clearly recall the tunes he&#039;d play with his wooden flute. \r\nMost of these memoirs were now blurs to her, however there was one event she would not forget. \r\nIt was the two&rsquo;s third hike to the top of Ionia&rsquo;s second tallest mountain, \r\nTaliyah embraced the plateau on the top, Yasuo stared into the sunset taking in the view. \r\nWhen Taliyah had noticed his stance, she joined him. They together could see the rim of the mainland. \r\nYasuo took a deep breath.\r\n\r\n&ldquo;What have you learnt from this kid?&rdquo; Yasuo questioned.\r\n\r\n&ldquo;Um&hellip; since we&rsquo;re up here faster than the previous times, that practice is perfect?&rdquo; She confidently stated. \r\n\r\n&ldquo;Practice is perfect?&rdquo; He laughed, &ldquo;Nothing is flawless, there is no perfection. \r\nThere is practice though. If you practice enough, people will not notice the flaws you make.&rdquo; \r\nHe assured Taliyah, looking at her questionable expression.\r\n\r\n&ldquo;So you&rsquo;re not perfect at breaking wind? Always thought you were.&rdquo; Taliyah cheekily replied.\r\n\r\nHe sighed, &ldquo;Exactly kid. But-&rdquo; He grabbed Taliyah shaking her back-and-forth for attention, \r\nnow both facing each other with the sunset in the background. \r\n\r\n&ldquo;Look Taliyah, if you remember one thing from all this, remember that perfection does not exist.&rdquo;\r\n\r\n&ldquo;But-&rdquo;\r\n\r\n&ldquo;There is no exception. We all have made mistakes before&hellip;&rdquo; He trailed off.\r\n\r\nTaliyah had never seen him so serious before; the dead-center concentration of his eyes into hers, \r\nthe tense aura, his eyes wide open, not even blinking, him so out of character and the assurance of her being serious.\r\n\r\n&ldquo;We&rsquo;re leaving now. Come on.&rdquo; Yasuo claimed, returning to his usual self and lunging off the ledge. \r\nTaliyah surprised of his choice, followed her master&rsquo;s path weaving the mountain under her feet as she went.\r\n**~~-----------------------~~**\r\n&hellip;the journal did not need to remind her of his lesson. \r\nThe one bookmarked page of her log from Ionia, &lsquo;**PERFECTION DOES NOT EXIST**&rsquo; she&rsquo;d written in bold. \r\n&ldquo;But practice is perfect&rdquo; She found herself mumbling again, tucking her journal away. \r\n&ldquo;You&rsquo;re wrong master Yasuo!&rdquo; She shouts in agony down the mountain. \r\nShe took a deep breath. \r\n&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s try again&rdquo; Taliyah said to herself again. \r\nShe closed her eyes, attempting to tear stone from the walls around her with her magic again. \r\nAgain, the ground rattles uplifting the endless slabs of rock that seem to exist. \r\nShe knows she has failed again, sighing in acknowledgement. \r\n&ldquo;Why can&rsquo;t I weave the walls!&rdquo; She squeals, kicking the stone she raised. \r\nShe begins to hear someone snicker at her. \r\nTaliyah goes on guard, looking side-to-side and down the mountain still on her pillar created from the previous failures.\r\n\r\n&ldquo;You never learnt, did you?&rdquo; She hears from above. \r\nShe looks up, sighting the chuckling Yasuo on top of the untouched cliff side.\r\n\r\n&ldquo;Look kid, tell me &lsquo;Practise is perfect&rsquo; when you think you&rsquo;ve &lsquo;perfected&rsquo; your weaving&rdquo; \r\nteased Yasuo, jumping down onto the rim of her disaster zone.\r\n\r\n&ldquo;Master Y-Y-Yasuo!&rdquo; Taliyah barely managed to say, only just being able to stand.\r\n\r\nHe continued to laugh.\r\n\r\n&ldquo;Kid, most people are afraid of me because they believe I&rsquo;ve &lsquo;perfected&rsquo; the arts. \r\nI can tell you this, I am not &lsquo;perfect&rsquo; at anything. No-one is.&rdquo; he gazed down onto Shurima.\r\n\r\n&ldquo;M-master! That&rsquo;s not tru-&rdquo;\r\n\r\n&ldquo;That is the truth!&rdquo; he stung. \r\n\r\n&ldquo;That is all you needed to learn. I have not become &lsquo;perfect&rsquo; in the arts. \r\nI have only mastered them in some areas. Why don&rsquo;t you do the same?&rdquo; \r\nHe rhetorically asks, pointing towards the jagged torn earth surrounding Taliyah. He takes a deep breath, \r\n&ldquo;This is a nice view point. Did you have to ruin the ground here?&rdquo;\r\n\r\nHe once again jumps down the mountainside, creating a trail of debris is his path. \r\nTaliyah stares down at his decent from her post. Why hadn&rsquo;t she thought of &lsquo;perfecting&rsquo; what she could do? \r\nShe once again, she begins the process, uplifting the ground. \r\n&ldquo;Another?&rdquo; she asks. \r\nAs another rock jerks upwards. \r\n&ldquo;And another!&rdquo; She cheers as another one begins to ascend. \r\nShe laughs in enjoyment of her success, causing the soaring stones to fall back down. \r\nIf she can &lsquo;perfect&rsquo; this and use this effectively, she can prove to her master that &lsquo;perfection&rsquo; does exist. \r\nShe persists in her tedious trial, shouting &ldquo;Another&rdquo; before the fourth pebble rose.\r\n\r\n&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll prove that &lsquo;perfection&rsquo; does exist!&rdquo; \r\nShe cheerfully shouts down the mountain one final time, with the four stones surprisingly continuing to circle her.\r\n\r\nThe master barely heard her, but he knew she would say that anyway. \r\nA grin came to his face, as he was dashing down the mountain. \r\n&ldquo;Then show me&rdquo; he jokingly mumbled.\r\n***\r\n\r\n_So. This is my first time doing anything like this at all!\r\nIf you&#039;re wondering about the inspiration behind this story, I wanted to write something about Taliyah since I really enjoy playing her and learnt about the original idea behind her &#039;Q&#039;, Threaded Volley; basically, the original idea for her &#039;Q&#039; was going to tear chunks off the walls, so while that was being coded they added her current &#039;Q&#039; without the worked terrain. The play-testers enjoyed playing with this version of the &#039;Q&#039; so they chose to stick with it.\r\nThis story revolves around why she has her current &#039;Q&#039; and not the original idea.\r\nHope you liked the story! I would love to receive feedback on what I&#039;ve done.\r\nChow for now.\r\n-Packet_\r\n\r\n***","replies":[{"poster":"Oneechan","date":"2016-07-10T11:13:36.319+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Glad you explained the inspiration. Really adds a little bit more to the story :) Though of course, even without it the story was a great read. Thoroughly enjoyed the Yasuo x Taliyah pairing. Very interesting interactions!","replies":[]}]}
