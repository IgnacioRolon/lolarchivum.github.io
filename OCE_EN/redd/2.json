If they instalock and are dicks about it i will happily just play who i want to play knowing that it might not result in the best team comp.  If i am in a good mood I'll pick meta but maybe pick a champ i might not be great at but want to practice. I don't worry too much about victory in normals. For me, normals are fun and an opportunity to practice new champs I am considering taking into ranked.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Infected Walnut","date":"2015-08-30T06:16:22.543+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"yeah i hat'e when people instalock.
