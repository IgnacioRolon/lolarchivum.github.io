Basically, I recorded a highlight showing someone trolling. I realized I accidentally had their summoner names turned on and then tried to redo it. I finished, but when I made the post concerning it, the video I uploaded to youtube was the one WITH the names. I immediately deleted the post upon finding out. Noone watched the video, but there were 3 views on my post. Am I going to be punished for this?
