So when any skin is released it doesn't go on sale straight away. So the bundle will be more like 1837 rp.\nReference\nhttps://twitter.com/RiotKateyKhaos/status/689955771614904320\nhttp://na.leagueoflegends.com/en/news/store/sales/were-changing-discounts","replies":[]},{"poster":"Kao Atlantis","date":"2016-01-07T18:54:53.351+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"There is very little information on the new champion. We only know bits and pieces, and the mechanics and gameplay haven't been announced yet. Once the Champion Spotlight is released, they should also release the price of the bundle. I would recommend watching the Spotlight when it is released and deciding yourself if you think that it is a worthwhile investment to pay for and play that champion.","replies":[]}]}
