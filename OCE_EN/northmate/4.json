Refers to Vi's grip as titanium, not rock, diamond or any other hard non-metal. \n2. Refers to Sona as a crafts**woman**.\n3. Jhin is said to have the title dead eye.\n4. Garen's verse mentions heart, which is the organ that was pierced in the teaser.\n\nAlso something you said reminded me of something\n\n_\"The people the jhinn killed all had lost memories, so they were probably seen by the jhinn.\"_\n_\n\"For your hand is the hand\nthat holds the key\nto the gates of limbo\"_\n\nMaybe you picked up on this as well but there is a book called **The Six Gates from Limbo**. It's a story about a guy named Rex who awakens in a strange paradise disoriented and **without memories. **The whole story is about him uncovering his past and why he is there.\n\nHe could also be referring to Limbo as the first layer of hell, as it is described in Dante's Inferno.\n\nJust wanted to add a bit to your ideas. Great stuff BTW looks right on point.","replies":[]},{"poster":"NorthMate","date":"2016-01-04T23:45:02.249+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Oh, and its number 63 that has the poem about deadeye","replies":[]}]}
