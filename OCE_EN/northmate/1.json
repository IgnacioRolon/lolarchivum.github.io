I also recommend that you watch yasuo and zed montages to see which one you prefer more,shadows or tornadoes :).\nHope this would help you decide between those 2.","replies":[{"poster":"Armies of Me","date":"2015-11-12T09:43:11.990+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"this is why we cant have nice things...\nyasuo AND zed main","replies":[]}]}]}
