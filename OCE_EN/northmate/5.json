What do you guys think we should have?","replies":[{"poster":"ƒamous","date":"2015-10-20T10:20:13.097+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Don't understand why people haven't dropped this discussion yet. I didn't like the idea of having to pay, or the idea of the skin itself. I eventually accepted that Riot won't budge so I got over it. I now own the skin because I wanted to contribute to charity and tbh if you overlook all the negatives, the ability effects aren't all that bad. Still would've liked to see it on a different champion, but nonetheless I'd like to see you make a better skin, have everyone rage and still not budge. It's hard to please everyone.\n\nIn all honesty people are sooks. I cannot understand why people haven't got over this yet. Obviously Riot won't change their decision and miraculously give everyone the skin for free or make a new skin. Deal with it and stop complaining.","replies":[{"poster":"Billos","date":"2015-10-20T10:34:38.583+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"People will keep complaining until Riot either acknowledge the complaints or the people complaining realise the futility of complaining.\n\nI'm not at that stage yet, so don't mind me. Maybe you should deal with it and stop complaining about the complainers :P","replies":[{"poster":"ƒamous","date":"2015-10-21T05:36:13.404+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"But Riot has already acknowledged the complaints by stating that the skin wouldn't be given out for free. People need to stop sooking and grow the fuck up. They're whining about pixels for gods sake. People need to realise it's only a game, and a skin doesn't mean shit in real life.\n\nEDIT: Pretty sure half the people who complained still bought the skin anyway so they contradicted everything they said.

They addressed multiple complaints in that thread also, should you need further evidence that they wouldnt change the skin/make a new one.","replies":[{"poster":"Billos","date":"2015-10-21T09:15:22.132+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Ah thank you.
