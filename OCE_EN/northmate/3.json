I was like, &quot;k kool let me test it out&quot;. So basically, because it&#039;s late right now and Im so tired, I clicked it, logged in, entered some of my acc details, and basically..... the website knows my acc details :D\r\n\r\nBeing the idiot I am, I copied the &quot;code&quot; and tried to access it. Then it hit me. I realised that the website was a www league of legends .com webiste. It was from 2014. \r\n\r\nSoooooooo basically are they able to access my acc? Just changed my password.
