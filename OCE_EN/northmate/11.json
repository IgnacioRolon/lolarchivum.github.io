Although it sounds a lot more overpowered than it really is, some players do not know how her stealth works. \r\n&quot;\r\nWhile obscured, Akali is stealthed and though her position can be revealed, Akali herself can&#039;t be&mdash;meaning she can&#039;t be targeted by abilities or attacks, including by turrets.\r\n&quot;\r\n\r\nThis W is similar to Teemo&#039;s passive - for those of you who don&#039;t know - Teemo cannot be targeted while revealed by true sight from a pink ward. His position can be seen when he is moving, however that is limited. Akali&#039;s W is a more powerful version of this, being stealthed through ANOTHER layer - Turrets. Her position can be seen, however just not TARGETED. This allows others to know where she is, helping them track her so she does not escape or for them to land a skillshot. This being said, means that this ability is unique only because she is unseeable to turrets. \r\n\r\nIf you don&#039;t believe me, try it out yourself with a friend. Get them to play Teemo and try reveal his passive. If this hasn&#039;t been changed, then he cannot be targeted.","replies":[{"poster":"Hellopolite","date":"2018-07-18T07:13:20.405+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"lol someone downvoted this","replies":[]}]}
