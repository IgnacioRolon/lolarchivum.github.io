If I click either one of these options, my computer restarts. I have contacted support but all they said was to get their hextech repair tool (which did NOTHING) and how leaverbuster worked. I am done, tired of this message, and even though I reconnect, my team always remakes, at the very last second I reconnect. I am tired of this shit, please someone help me.","replies":[]}
