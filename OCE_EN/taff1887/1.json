If riot could just make bans stricter i guarantee people won&#039;t abuse it. My friend leaves games whenever he wants and he never gets banned????!!??!?! The punishments are so weak. if someone does something wrong and you report them for 1 week straight off the bat, i highly doubt they will do it again. The amount of times people have just left games is ridiculous. Maybe make a rule where normals can be weaker punishments but ranked punishments stronger. Also maybe they are banned from ranked for a while..?","replies":[{"poster":"Istehz","date":"2015-07-02T06:58:14.813+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Lets rule out the most obvious reasons to why a person is AFK or didn't connect\n\n1. They lost lane\n2. His/Her team is feeding\n3. They have to go\n\nDid you ever think that just maybe that person and a very good excuse to why they left?\n\n1. Something very important came up and they had to leave immediately\n2. Someone called them and something had happened\n3. Their power went out for the night\n4. Their computer over heated\n5. They are home looking after their siblings and something happened\n6. Worst case scenario there's an intruder\n\nJust because someone leaves the game doesn't mean they should be banned permanently. \n\nIf you're sick of people leaving ranked (solo/duo) or normal's why don't you make some friends or if you have friends play with them and make sure you play with 5.","replies":[]}]}
