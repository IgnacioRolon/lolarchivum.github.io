Eg. I was playing a fizz a few days ago, i had my jg item and was building the botrk. When the other team jumped in to try steal dragon i practically got instakilled. Im fine with champs like zed, rengar (ult or movement speed after using it), kha'zix, because they can all get out easily. Can someone please explain how to position and early game squishy? Thanks.","replies":[{"poster":"Mar3thyu","date":"2015-03-08T00:13:45.828+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"you need to position on the outside like an adc where as with rengar and zed you want to dive them. You need to within range to jump in and kill your target though kind of like talon so wait for your bruiser/tank to initiate then pick your target ult go ham then get out once they are dead","replies":[{"poster":"Taff1887","date":"2015-03-13T06:44:02.940+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"thanks, just played that in early game and ended up smashing. Late game i could just jump in anyway and not die (after i got tanky)","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"TouchMyKimchi","date":"2015-03-08T08:56:55.780+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"Uhhh.. Jg Fizz building into a BOTRK? That's already a fail. And with one of the top 5 escape mechanics I'm not sure how you're popped so easily using him.\n\nIf you are having trouble with your positioning, perhaps build appropriately or play an off tank until you learn where you need to be.","replies":[{"poster":"TrashDonnut","date":"2015-03-08T10:34:58.990+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"No, BoTRK is OP on Fizz as his AP ratio is now %%%%.\n\nAD Fizz all the way.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Taff1887","date":"2015-03-13T06:43:10.611+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"watch nightblue3... watch some fizz streams after his ap ratio nerf.
