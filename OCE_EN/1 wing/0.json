Why does it kick us out to miss a ban?!?!","subforum":"Gameplay & Strategy","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"In competetive play, sometimes players choose not to ban!\r\n\r\nSecondly, how about having the icon in the toolbar light up, when it&#039;s your turn to ban.\r\n\r\nIs it going to be 30 seconds before it&#039;s my turn to ban? 2 minutes???? I literally don&#039;t know: it&#039;s different every game; the length of time each player takes to ban, is different every single game. There should at least be more notification. \r\n\r\nPlayers are talking about pineapple pen, suddenly I look up and there&#039;s 2 seconds left for me to ban with. Trying to click on anyone: there&#039;s 0 seconds left, and I&#039;m trying to click on the ban button: &quot;I don&#039;t care who&#039;s in this game! Ban anyone!! I literally don&#039;t care if anyone&#039;s banned or not!!&quot;\r\n\r\n5 minute wait time!\r\nI clicked on a champion! How about banning that champion, if I don&#039;t click the ban button??\r\n\r\n\r\n&quot;It&#039;s your duty to watch, and be prepared to ban.&quot; \r\nYah, and this is a normal match: it&#039;s supposed to be more relaxed than ranked play.\r\nIn professional play, sometimes players choose not to ban!!!!!!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat a load of garbage Riot throws upon us.","replies":[{"poster":"dragon poo","date":"2016-10-15T01:23:40.115+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Why is this on  oce? we don een have draft pick, if you arent locking in bans, its your own fault for not paying attention for 2 minutes in  lobby.","replies":[]}]}
