Even if your team gets better players, you're still 5 strangers vsing 4 people who should have excellent communication and 1 person who can just tag along. I don't really care if someone's alone with a group of 4 as long as they don't all pick on the one person, but communication is better than raw skill.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"RonyStark","date":"2016-02-23T03:21:51.744+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"dat face tho","replies":[]}]}]}
