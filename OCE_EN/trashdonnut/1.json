This is EXTREMELY dangerous to do. Personally i've been through a bit of depression and I believe someone would actually do this if depressed enough. It actually happened to me recently which caused me to post this. I ask that we do something to let Riot know that this is not ok. It poses a real threat to peoples lives. If anyone has any ideas on how to get the word out to riot, i'd like to stop this behaviour as I believe it is exceptionally dangerous.\r\n> TL;DR Summoners telling their allies to kill themselves has got to stop. It's dangerous and unacceptable under any circumstance. Help me tell Rito it has to stop!\r\n> \r\n> \r\n> \r\n> EDIT: Thank you all who have shown your support. If you are just reading this for the first time please post and tell me your examples of how something similar has happened to you! I want RITO to see this.

It gets to a point where having memorials at school for kids who have committed suicide becomes a semi-regular thing, we need to do something to protect them, its no ones fault that younger people are particularily more vulnerable to depression.
