Modes will likely repeat every 1.5~2 months. Again, once we get started and see what modes come and go from the rotation, this could shift a little bit\"\n**THIS IS ALOT OF MATH:**\nSo working with **1.5** urfs every **2 months **would make urf come **9** times a year, which makes **18** days. why the fuck are people complaining? its **4 days MORE **than normal and its split within the year to add a new feel towards it.\n\nAlso asuming your in nz and schooling is still going on then you would miss out on **9 hours **(7am-4pm) of urf to school and buses, then go to bed around 10, you would also take an **hour break for dinner and another hour for homework**, and also your **sleeping for 8** of those hours (10pm-6am) this makes about **4-5 hours of urf in a weekday**, say if urf ran for friday april 1st to 15th you would only **get 4 weekends (sat,sun)** of full playing in urf and **10 days of schooldays **you would only get **50 hours of urf out of 2 weeks in weekdays only**\n\nWeekend: you'd probably be sleeping (10pm-7am) for 9 hours of the weekend, 3 hours having breakfast,lunch and dinner you would only get 11 hours (on average) of a weekend day, which means 11x4 (hours times weekend days) =44 which makes 94 hours of urf if they run it for 14 days straight.\n**it would be 336 hours overall if you no lifed to the extreme, so if your in school your loosing almost 2/3 of urf time to school\n**\nIf riot moved it to 18 days on weekends only you would on average have (18 days x 11 hours), 198 hours of urf doubling it if it was for weekends only. so student players what sounds more appealing? 94 hours of urf in 14 days or 198 (average without going into town or such) hours of urf in 18 days....\n\nI'd expect you'd like the 198 hours rather than the 94, the weekend queues idea is built around busy weekday people, riot have made a very good call to players of all ages.\n\nSo stop giving riot shit, the math has been done, its more effeicent for weekend gamemodes than running for 2 weeks straight (this may not apply to you non student players but still its a valid point that most people have to respect this)","replies":[{"poster":"Saythes","date":"2016-04-04T09:26:41.766+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Mind you, you do realise that all school students (Aus and NZ) are on holiday ATM?
