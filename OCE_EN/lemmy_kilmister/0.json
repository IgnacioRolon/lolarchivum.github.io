I recently received a ban for toxicity when shortly after it resulted in a permanent ban. I do however understand that my actions were in fact incorrect and despite riots strict \"no toxicity\" rules I still was toxic regardless and I do agree that I deserve some form of punishment just not a permanent ban. I've been playing the game for almost 10 years , have about 300 skins and I've spent roughly 600-1000 dollars (aus) easily on the game alone. I'm not saying my actions were justified , i'm not saying i wasn't toxic , but what i am saying is that the banning evaluation is highly flawed. The majority of the time i am being negative towards my team is when they are being negative towards me. Sure , you can bring up the chat logs and say that i was being extremely offensive however i knew what i was saying. In terms of my behavior in the past I have more honors than reports. Tell me how its fair to give a chat restriction to someone who has been honored for \"friendly player\" 300+ times but the one time someone gets the best of them it's worthy of a ban. It makes no sense. The internet is a cruel place and sorry riot they're far more toxic undercover players than you think and that will never go away. No matter how strict you are with your rules. I'm not asking for you to wave the penalty but seriously? a permanent ban to an account that i have supported you on for 10 years almost. Its plain stupidity and yes i understand \"Why be toxic if you can't handle the penalty\" i'm a human being , i have emotions and sometimes i get angry, don't we all? Sometimes like everyone i take my frustration out on the game or people but guess what , i'm 100% sure that the people i  have so viciously \"Attacked\" are doing fine! They don't care. If you even think for one second that you're doing everyone a favor with these insanely unnecessary bans well think again. I can always make a new account and just like everyone i can make multiple accounts , troll and do what ever i want. But that's not the point, the sheer amount of time and money wasted just to get banned for saying nothing but words. I've seen far worse and people get away with it . But that's justice right? I understand that \"We can't do anything the ban is final and blah blah blah\" what a load of hogwash. Every person that is toxic on this game is an average Joe with nothing better to do than to play games and troll. Trolls suck , they do but every single person on the internet has said things they don't mean. Because yes..its the internet, you're not meant to take offensive to people. There's 7 billion people on this planet and we are able to pretty much connect with everyone so you're bound to find a racist or an incredibly mean person , don't you think? There's millions of league players so the chances of running into someone that doesn't share the same thinking or decision making as you is bound to happen. I'd really like to discuss this topic in order to come to an agreement.","replies":[{"poster":"PolitePlayer","date":"2019-02-10T17:45:26.410+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Money spent does not counter negative behaviour.","replies":[{"poster":"Lemmy Kilmister","date":"2019-02-25T01:08:00.000+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Right but 10 years of supporting a company kind of does?

I would be treated the same way as any other first-time thief, regardless of how much I was paying in tax (I've spent x much on this game), or how long I'd gone before stealing that TV (I haven't received a single punishment in x years of playing).\n\nSimilarly, my neighbour stealing my expensive deck chairs doesn't make stealing his TV anymore okay (they started it), nor does being beloved by all the other neighbours on the street (but I always get honoured).\n\nTo run with the metaphor, just because someone else stole my mate's Lamborghini, still doesn't mean my TV stealing ways are suddenly allowed (other people are doing worse stuff than me).\n\n___\n\nWhat I think is especially key here, is that this is a permanent ban. In other words, not your first offence. Assuming all your punishments have been chat related, you've had between 1 and 3 prior punishments to reach this point (not including the current perma). \n\nIf you've had 3, then that means you progressed naturally through the system, you had two chat restrictions as a warning of your behaviour, and one 14-day that very explicitly warns that any further transgressions will be met with permanent suspension, and yet ignored them all.\n\nIf you've had 1 or 2, then that means you have been escalated through the system, which is only achieved through language like hate speech. In this case, you received at least a 14-day ban which again, very explicitly warns that any further transgressions would result in permanent suspension, and ignored it.\n\nRegardless of your views on punishment for chat, it has been made very clear to you through your past punishments that such language that resulted in those punishments would not be allowed in this community. Whether or not you agree with that perspective is somewhat irrelevant, because you agree to play by the *community's rules* to play the game, not your own. \n\nDespite knowing that what you were doing would see you punished, because it has in the past, you continued. Despite being explicitly warned of the consequences, you continued. So my question then is why?","replies":[]}]}]}]}
