Riot has send me an email said &quot;our suspension was only issued after an extensive investigation was run to ensure your involvement in MMR boosting. As explained in the email you received in response to your suspension, the following actions have been taken on your account:\r\n\r\n-A two-week suspension has been issued to your account.\r\n-All previous Season rewards (Victorious skins, borders, season icons, season ward skins) have been stripped from your account.\r\n-You are ineligible for any 2015 Season rewards\r\n\r\nWhile you may feel that this punishment is too harsh, please realize that having accounts boosted, for whatever reason, ruins the spirit of League of Legends competitive play. While you are ineligible for any rewards in the 2015 Season, this does not disqualify you for anything pertaining to the 2016 Season. Keep in mind that if you have any future involvement in MMR boosting, your account will be permanently suspended.&quot;\r\n\r\nCome on Riot, how can you prove that? Can you show me any evidence to prove that? I promise all games of my account are played by myself, just sometimes I played at home and some times I played at Internet cafe. During the holiday, I have played a lot of rank games and after holiday I almost played normal games. Is that wrong？Do I have the right to select where and when to play rank game？\r\n\r\nWhy Riot has suspended a lot of accounts？Most people know there are some player have found other person to help them get higher rank. Riot has judged them due to their accounts were log on at a different IP address. Also most people understand the internet of people&#039;s residence are not so good to play rank game，lag is the problem. Then some players have been to internet cafe to play rank game. Finally，Riot has suspended their accounts. Is that fair？\r\n\r\nI have spend a lot of money and time in this game. I can not accept this result. Riot please give a reasonable explaination to me and all of player that you have treated unjustly.","replies":[{"poster":"GentlemanReptile","date":"2015-11-09T12:12:44.868+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"My advice? Tell Riot to go fuck themselves and find a game that is actually managed properly. \n\nThey dont give a shit about you, these are the people who banned my account by accident when I sent them a ticket requesting help regarding threats to my personal identity from other players. \n\nThey seriously don't give a shit.
