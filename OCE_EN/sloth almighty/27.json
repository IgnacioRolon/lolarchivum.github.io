But lately I&#039;ve decided winning is more fun lol\r\n\r\nSo i got into the serious end of the stick and decided to start maining a champ properly, I researched and watched a heap of blitz games.\r\nSince then, i&#039;ve only dropped 1 game with him and won 14 of my last 15 games with blitz. But there&#039;s always room to improve and my stats are far from impressive.\r\n\r\nI&#039;d like to know what other people use in terms of self reviewing post games. Either recording the game, or software that tracks specific data or time stamped heat mapping of sorts. Is it possible to record a game, that has map fog disabled, so I can see what the enemy was doing at X time I made a certain mistake?? Keen to try further my blitz game and support role, before expanding my pool of &#039;main&#039; champions.","replies":[{"poster":"Er√∏se","date":"2016-08-17T22:40:49.925+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Replay.gg","replies":[]},{"poster":"JasonWazza","date":"2016-08-17T07:11:23.220+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Personally i just use Replay.GG because it means i can pick whatever game i want to re-watch and go through it.\n\nAnd as a note, any replay, you can disable fog, see enemy wards and everything inbetween that.","replies":[{"poster":"Sloth Almighty","date":"2016-08-17T10:03:12.619+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Cool, thanks for the info","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"YellowBrickRoad","date":"2016-08-17T00:57:54.084+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yes infact it is.\n\nYou can either use lolreplay, or my personal favourite is to use the op.gg record replay button since i usually have the tab open anyway","replies":[{"poster":"Sloth Almighty","date":"2016-08-17T04:06:45.332+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Wow.
