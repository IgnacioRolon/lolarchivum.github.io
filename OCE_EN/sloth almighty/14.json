Can&#039;t CS properly. My warding stinks because i&#039;m lazy. And I don&#039;t take the game seriously not even for a second.\r\n\r\nBut those things aside, I feel I need to quit my day job. Literally, close the doors to my business, forget about all the stress of slogging it out week after week just to pay overheads and tax, and just get paid to play League. Every day.\r\n\r\nLive in a gaming house, and get paid to play computer games. All god damn day long!\r\n\r\n...sigh. I hate you pro players and your stupid talent! I hate working for a living! Lemme play computer games for a living dammit I want an easy life too lol\r\n{{champion:32}}","replies":[]}
