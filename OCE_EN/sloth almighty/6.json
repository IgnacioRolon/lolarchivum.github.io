What is the etiquette on kills as a support, is there even one?\r\n\r\nExample I recently went 5/0/15 with lux support, and the entire game my adc flamed me and said how junk i was, even though they went 18/13/9 mid game they started solo laning with ashe and kept dieying, it was some how my fault because I was grouping with everyone else for team fights.\r\nIs it my role as a support to stick with the adc the entire game? Or do I support the group fights regardless if my adc is there or not?\r\n\r\nAnother game I went 3/9/23 with blitz, but again flamed everytime i scored a kill because all 3 occasions my adc had &lt;100 health left i didnt want them to die (support imo) so I Q&gt;E&gt;R scored the kills, saved my adc on 2 occasions but i get trashed for taking the kill?\r\nNext blitz support game i went 0/14/23 with hard intent to not score a single kill, then i get accused of feeding. I can&#039;t win?\r\n\r\nIf i see a kill should I go for it, or poke them down and leave them and just pray my team will score the kill and not get killed themselves?\r\nWhen I play adc i praise my support for a kill it helps me push the lane, it doesnt bother me who gets the kill aslong as its our team thats doing the killing.\r\n\r\nCan anyone please define what a support should or should not be doing? Because I am just confused. Or is this just unranked children having a pitch fit because they want to appear best on ground?","replies":[{"poster":"Yasei Doubutsu","date":"2016-06-09T07:18:32.261+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"I'm a support main, so I like to think I can help you out.\n\nTry picking supports to what character your ADC/Team is playing.\nLux support is ok, but that's just what it is, its just ok.\n\nLeona, Thresh, Braum are probably some of the best supports.\nSoraka, Nami, Sona and Janna follow closely. (Taric is apart of both now)\n\nSupports are usually Identified in 3 categories.\nSustain, Poke, and burst (I may have gotten that last one wrong I've forgotten)\n\nSustain = Soraka, Nami, Sona.\nPoke = Lulu, Annie, Lux (Some of the sustain cats can also be in this.)\nBurst = Brand, Annie etc.\n\nIf you have an ADC that is poke based, Varus for example, usually a poke based support goes well. (You could try and mix and match)\n\nBut as I said, try and pick a support for you team, sure for the first 20 mins you will be baby sitting the ADC. But it is a team game, you will be supporting them as well.\nAlso, if you have to kill someone to protect your adc, then do so. They can suck it up.\n\nSightstone should be a first item, don't go full AP or AD.\nOnce you get a sightstone get a sweeper.\n\nI don't personally like a lux support, or brand/annie. (But hay what ever works)\nI find that Bruam and Leona to be far more reliable.\n\nI should probably look into some things more myself...\n\nAlso, thunderlords for poke based supports, but you would usually have windspeakers or Stone.","replies":[{"poster":"Cocoslashcrash2","date":"2016-06-09T07:40:49.011+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Adding onto this,\nFind a type of support you like playing and master those. I main support and I prefer to play tank supports such as nautilus, braum, taric and Leona.\nIts always useful to have a few other tricks up your sleeve, like a morgana, bard or blitz. I would also say supporting your mid top and jg rather than just the adc is going to be better for your team, but that's just my opinion","replies":[]},{"poster":"Spiersie","date":"2016-06-09T10:35:55.484+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"where you said burst, i think the were you were looking for was \"all-in\" ? :)","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Sloth Almighty","date":"2016-06-16T04:46:10.908+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Great advice everyone, some handy tips here I can take on board for sure.\n\nThanks heaps :)","replies":[]},{"poster":"Firebolt","date":"2016-06-10T17:10:15.318+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'm sorry that your best games as support got you flamed by the ADC. The best advice I can give you is get used to it... As sad as it is, you'll always get an ADC that just wants an excuse to bash you, even if you do nothing wrong. It might be helpful to find a friend who enjoys playing ADC and you enjoy playing with them. \n\nOther general advice I can offer is that have good map awareness, always build a Sightstone first (and change from yellow to red trinket when you do), always have a Vision ward on the map, and if you can't leave the kill to your ADC for whatever reason, take it. If they respond negatively, either ignore it, block them, or troll them back (in Normal games only XD \"Kill secured\" or \"this kill will help me tank/peel better for you\" usually shuts them up for me). The ADC gets to free farm, and should have no reason to complain. Also, when you see an opportunity, try to get your jungler to come bot to take Dragon. I find that some junglers only need a little encouragement to start grabbing objectives.\n\nMy final piece of advice is that it's important to be versatile as a support, through both your champion pool and in game actions. What I mean is that it's good to have multiple champions that you know how to play to compliment your ADC's pick/counter the enemies' picks. Being versatile in game means being able to adapt to the situation even in less than favourable matchups. That enemy Draven is just dealing too much damage? You should probably drop Boots of Swiftness for Ninja Tabi. At the end of the day, the game's about blowing the Nexus up, not getting a good KDA or CS score. Those help you to win the game, but skill and knowledge are usually more vital.

So if you can kill someone as a support, do it, but keep in mind that having a fed carry is also fantastic.
