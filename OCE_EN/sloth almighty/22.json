Then to confirm they get in game and feed like your game doesnt even matter anymore.\r\n\r\nIt&#039;s becoming a joke just how many there are now, sometimes you get 1 poor soul with 4 bots on their team facing a full 5 man squad. Its just not fun.\r\n\r\nPlease tell us there is some heavy work going into this problem and that it is of some importance!?","replies":[{"poster":"SamuraiFeederKat","date":"2017-11-09T13:16:06.292+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I am having the same issue and I am only level 8. I just lost the last 2 matches because 4 bots with me in the first game and 3 started spamming to quit from minute 20 minutes hit. Then the next game I only got 3 bots but the enemy team only had 2 so we lost again and again a bot tried to quit at 20. They feed then quit. It sucks. I liked this game till I got stuck in botland. They have names like blahWlBc and blahOdSv.  And this is like any time I have tried to play aram so it is not limited to late night even it is around the clock. I keep reporting them every game and I have even tried leaving it for a while before queueing. But Riot REALLY needs to work this out. It really does super suck for new players. Or for anyone wanting to play late night. Maybe we need one of those bot check tests before being able to enter queues. Haha. And while writing this I DID manage to win one because my team had 3 seemingly real people while the poor only real guy on the enemy team had 4. Poor Kayle. I reported their bots for him too. Not that any report I have ever put in has seemed to be followed up on by riot but I won't stop trying to make the OCE server a better place for all.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Sloth Almighty","date":"2017-11-09T09:29:55.034+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Just another point of note, I have seen the same bot account 4 nights this week and played with/against it 9 times collectively. All 9 times I have reported, and still this BOT account is here playing, unbanned, ruining other players experience.\n\nWhen does something actually get done about this? Its becoming known as ABAM, not ARAM.

I report them all and encourage others to do so too, but it really is at a climax.\n\nSurely it's not Riot putting these bots in to serve as fill ins to reduce long queue times? Crazy thought I know, but the influx is so ridiculous it makes me wonder how this many can even be allowed to exist. Surely it stands out like a sore thumb by now??","replies":[]},{"poster":"Waysted1","date":"2017-11-06T01:22:06.121+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"it is bad, remember to report them all at the end of game.","replies":[]}]}
