This is not how league of legends works, it's all about teamwork, and how you move around the map to pressure other lanes. This system would not work for the game that league of legends is, this is not street fighter, it's not a 1v1 game. How well you do in lane is meaningless if you don't affect other lanes, You could go 10/0 in lane and have perfect cs, but if you don't bring that lead to other lanes, you'll end up throwing the game.

Hm...that kind of ranking sounds so good, like being au naturel, but it'll also take a tonne more time to make IF a huge majority of players agree or want it. Especially with some trolls not helping until they can come in and ks kills and they end up looking positive with least deaths at the end of a lost match without taking much or dealing much damage. There are so many kinds of a trolls, I wont give a buck to list them -.- That ranking system does sound really nice though. I reckon the amount of IP deducted for lost matches has more priority than a new rank system right now though X_X (e.g 3 trolls feeding  and blatantly announcing it over and over in chat). This kind of ranking system might take ages to work into the game...maybe. \n\nIt was dangerously close to almost sounding like a sandbox game where people are just whacking at each other when I read 'A win or a loss should not even be taken into consideration',  but not really.

Heck, most players responding to those posts are convinced it's flawed too. It always boils down to League not being the kind of game where an individual score is able to explain the context of that score, how good the player is to have got that score or how it even impact the outcome. For example, you can't say that\n\n>A win or a loss should not even be taken into consideration.\n\nwithout considering the aim of the game. _Destroy the enemy nexus_. To change the aim to \"obtain the best score\" would shift the dynamic towards more selfish playstyles where kda is king. In Call of Duty's team deathmatch mode where there are 0 objectives beyond killing the enemy there is a clear reason to employ this kind of playstyle and room for such a performance rating system to exist. League on the other hand is the convergence of more nuanced tactics and ideas that do not revolve around the kda but directly lead to destroying the nexus (like zoning, vision control and stopping recalls amongst many others). I just don't think there's a system that could fairly and consistently evaluate the performance of a player in League, better than win/loss, and I doubt there ever will.\n\n>Even if you had a world class top 3 player... that player would still struggle to carry the team\n\nFinally, it's difficult to remove oneself from their own subjective Ranked experience, especially in regards to frustration and futility, but world class players generally have no problem carrying games far beneath them. In general, their superior mechanics and game knowledge allow them (and those dirty elo-boosters) to rank up multiple accounts quickly and effortlessly to diamond. I wasn't convinced of this until I realised how generously I was double promoted twice in a row from G5 > G3 > G1 and passed promos into P5 on the first go on another account. Now, I know I'm not the best player but if I was able to do this as a __support__ main I'm sure the Doublelift's and Bjergsen's of the world would have 0 problem doing it no matter what rating they were placed in simply by playing the game the way it was designed to be played - to destroy the enemy nexus.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Miicka","date":"2016-08-27T16:24:33.161+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The ranked system isn't flawed at all in my opinion.

Also if that was a 380 farm nasus or veigar you've just lost your team the game. On another note; how come denying last hits and zoning doesn't contribute to game score. If I manage to make my enemy nasus have 20cs at 20min and I have 140cs that's an achievement and I should get some bonus for this. Like for every 50cs the lane opponent is below average, your cs value used in the calculation is increased by 20.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Nightjar","date":"2016-08-28T01:55:14.137+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I have a question for you then? A shaco that goes 0-1-11 in a game where his team has 14 kills total and is pressuring all lanes is carrying through getting his laners ahead and is doing his job beautifully; but a shaco that goes 11-1-0 could only be farming the enemy jungler and ksing and isn't really helping his lanes, especially as a champ that falls off and can't hard carry teamfights. The former shaco is playing much much better but the latter shaco will have a better score and more jungle cs. Does the latter shaco deserve a higher rank than the former shaco? No, no he does not cause he is not playing better, he's just playing more selfishly. How good your score is is redundant. It's about game impact and kills don't equal wins.
