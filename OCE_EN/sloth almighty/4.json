When I am looking for runes for example, and I go from the shop back to my profile, check what ever there I wanted to check, and head back to the shop. It will open the shop back to the place I was looking at, then 1 or 2 seconds later it will refresh and go back to the start, losing my place in the shop again.\n\nIs this a bug or feature? Does it need to refresh every time you go into it? And if it does, can it at least save your place you were last at?\nObviously not even a big issue, just a functional refinement that would be swell to have. Especially since I have a poverty-pack &quot;gaming&quot; laptop, running with \"fast\" ADSL off-net, that makes switching tabs in the shop quite clunky and time consuming.","replies":[{"poster":"BarryButcher","date":"2016-09-12T08:35:44.306+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"yes it does that because the client sucks. Riot has said on numerous occasions that the current client is \"pushing the limits\" for what it can do considering its like 6 year old tech.\n\nTheres a new client currently in Alpha that will hopefully fix most the issues the current client has, but won't be available until next year sometime (probably).","replies":[{"poster":"Sloth Almighty","date":"2016-09-12T08:56:27.846+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Oh good, if there is a new one on the way i guess there is not much point stuffing around with this one while its functioning (enough).\nAs long as this is not a thing in the new client, i'll be happy to wait","replies":[]},{"poster":"YellowBrickRoad","date":"2016-09-12T08:56:25.888+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"ive been in the alpha for that client for a couple months, can confirm it uses the same shop and the issue isnt fixed at all.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Łæoña","date":"2016-09-12T05:55:23.822+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Your prob just making too fast demand so it just lags a little when you visit the store again.
