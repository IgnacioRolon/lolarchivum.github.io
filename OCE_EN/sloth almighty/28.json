But i&#039;m fine with that, i have fun.\r\n\r\nPlayed my second game of ranked today, and for some reason im put against Silver 1 to Silver 5s. I&#039;m not even ranked Bronze 5 yet, let alone good enough to be silver. These guys stomped all over me, they had better map awareness, better grouping, better objective play. Just far better players than I.\r\nWhy am I playing with silver guys when i am no where near their level? Cant a first time unranked player be matched with other first time/bronze 5s???\r\n\r\nThe reason i dont play ranked is because this has happened to me twice now, and its just not fun.\r\nI&#039;m a below average junk player, why match me with decent players???","replies":[{"poster":"Z3npachi","date":"2016-07-22T23:33:17.023+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I think your base mmr starts at silver somewhere. Just play through the matches, you will be faced up against people better than you until the mmr levels out but then you can actually enjoy your perceived bronze ranked experience. Then you can practice in a ranked environment against players of a similar level.","replies":[{"poster":"Sloth Almighty","date":"2016-07-23T00:35:04.154+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"that would be great, because i just played another and it put me with silvers and 2 gold 5s.

Just try your best to do well, it also helps to look at guides on youtube and stuff. If you're at least gold material though, you can get out of bronze fairly easily. Its silver league that gets you. I find it baffling that in mid silver I find someone playing jungle ryze with nashors tooth and gunblade.

However its just riot seeing how good you are, thats what placements are for. However i think its redundant at this point.

Norms is all about testing out new champs and learning mechanics going ham having fun, ranked is refining and testing those skills in a more competitive environment.","replies":[{"poster":"JasonWazza","date":"2016-07-23T02:51:47.633+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"If you think ranked is even, then you don't understand ranked at all.","replies":[{"poster":"Sloth Almighty","date":"2016-07-23T03:21:50.912+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"i dont understand ranked at all... but i also dont understand why its not even? thats like putting a honda civic in with the V8 supercars and saying thats fair","replies":[{"poster":"JasonWazza","date":"2016-07-23T11:20:27.410+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The reason i wouldn't call it even is because there are way too many factors that come into it.\n\nThe funny thing is you brought up one way it is uneven, in that smurfs and shit exist, and it's probably fairly close to comparing a honda civic to a V8, but league can't ever be even (though thanks to dynamic queue it's made it less so) simply because of all the differences that come into play.\n\nBecause a small example, you could be Diamond worthy in your decision making (Probably a bad example but the best i can think of), but bronze worthy in everything else, and because of this it's going to be hard to place you in a spot where you truly deserve your rank.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}
