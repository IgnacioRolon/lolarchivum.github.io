Also what about things like Karmas E or lux&#039;s prismatic barrier?\r\n \r\nThen there is Blitzs passive, is that ignored by true damage when it gets activated?","replies":[{"poster":"Chalze","date":"2016-09-07T06:30:15.875+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"As someone said before, true damage is defined as damage which cannot be reduced by any means. Invulnerabilities and untargetabilities are exceptions since those are a separate mechanic, but otherwise true damage has no 'special' interactions with shields.
