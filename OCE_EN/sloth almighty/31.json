Markos chimed in &quot;woah calm down friend, what seems to be the problem??&quot;.\n\nAs Spiros started to point out the window to the harbor, he declares &quot;See all those boats out there? I built every single one of them, with my bare hands!&quot;.\nFrustratingly adding &quot;but does anyone care about that? you would think everyone would call me Spiros the boat builder!!&quot;\n\n&quot;.... but you f**k ONE goat....&quot;","replies":[]}
