(giving 30 different potential champions for that entire game).\r\nGame rules and objectives play out as normal, 5v5 on Summoners Rift, but with an increased gold production rate.\r\nWhen a champion is slain, the summoner can then pick one of his/her other 2 champions to use, that they chose before the game started.\r\nEvery new level 1 champion will start with experience equal to the average experience their team currently has. So if the average champion experience is level 3 on your team, your new champion will come out at level 3. Gold would also be added to this new champion, equal to the average gold your team currently has.\r\nThis allows new champions a chance to fight those on the other team that have not died, with both experience and gold.\r\n\r\nUpon death, you can use any champion you wish from your 3 champion pool, so long as that champions death timer has come off cool down (which should be 3 times longer (per that specific champions level) than normal, due to having access to 3 champions).\r\nSo if all your 3 champions die in quick succession, you have to wait until at least 1 of your champions death timers finish, or wait longer for your desired champions to come off death cool down.\r\n\r\nChampions keep all items/gold/experience upon death, so they can be selected back into the game as they where when they died. Only new champions that have not been used yet, would gain the average experience/gold as mentioned above.\r\n\r\nI feel this would be a great way to change the team fight dynamics continuously in a single game, give people a chance to learn what champions to counter pick when going back into battle, and due to the higher gold ratio, force people to decide whether its worth risking changing their item build to counter what is there, or stick with it to counter what might be coming.... or, worst case scenario sacrifice your champion to pull one of your others out.\r\nDoing this though, would obviously be a disadvantage as that champion is not gaining gold or experience while sitting back in the champion pool.\r\n\r\nIf a 3 champion pool would be too much for the game, even access to 2 champions to tag with would be pretty cool.","replies":[{"poster":"Sloth Almighty","date":"2016-08-05T01:34:50.563+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I know nothing about coding a game or whats involved etc, so perhaps i am imagining this to be a lot simpler to do than what it is.\n\nBut basically, for arguments sake lets say you start the game choosing Garen as your 1st champion, and then Lux and Bard as the 2 others you have in your pool for that game.\n\nStart out level 1 like everyone else and do everything the same as a normal 5v5 game. Most people reach level 4 and first blood is scored against you, and your Garen dies. With only say i dunno, a {{item:1054}} a pair of {{item:3672}} and x2 {{item:2003}}. 2 points in Q, 1 point in W and 1 point in E.\n\nYou then choose to bring your Bard out for what ever reason, and because the average experience on your team is level 4, Bard comes out level 4. And the team gold is sitting on say 32k, which means the average team gold is 6400, which is what you would get to spend on Bard.\n\nBard gets items, plays for a bit, dies, then you bring out Lux. Same deal with XP and Gold applies to lux, only it would be greater amount presuming the game had gone on for several minutes before Bard died.\n\nyada yada yada, then you lose lux.\n\nNow, presuming you wanted to bring Garen back out, because he has already been played, he would come back out as Level 4, carrying {{item:1054}} a pair of {{item:3672}} and x2 {{item:2003}} and the same amount of gold he had when he died. Still with 2 points in Q, 1 point in W and 1 point in E.\n\n\nExperience and gold distribution would only be applied to new champions on the rift. So its advisable to die as little as possible to retain high level champions, or spawn new ones at a high level.\n\nPut simply, you are having 30 champions in the same game, only 20 of them would be hidden/inactive at all times until they are bought out/swapped over.\nI'm sure that would not be complicated at all to write?","replies":[]},{"poster":"Nightjar","date":"2016-08-02T08:39:01.125+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"that would take some work though to deal with stacking passives which are attached to your character. Imagine that veigar you picked first stacking 300 ap carrying over or the useless silver serpents from gangplank once you are forced to changed to say ahri. Also what happens to your build? Does it carry over and have ap garen or does it get refunded and that stacked seraphs is lost. What about levels and skills points taken? It would take a massive amount of rework to balance and make work. Sounds cool but doesn't feel possible.","replies":[]}]}
