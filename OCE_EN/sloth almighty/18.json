I&#039;m Sloth.\r\n\r\nBeen playing URF all weekend, recently forced into going cold turkey at 3am this morning. Queued at 2:58am for my last game, queue time was 2 minutes to get in, all of a sudden I am in the champion select, or champion lock rather, where I had a random champ selected and was instalocked. Along with all other 9 people. Joined the rift, and was granted normal mode. With no-one having correct meta picks, summoners or mysteries, it was an array of confusion for all at first. We all queued for URF, and was trolled into a game of norms. An URF junkies worst nightmare.\r\nI TP into lane, but realise its on a massive cooldown. What is this? Is this some sort of sick joke? I must be in hell. I burn my flash for a simple poke, but the cooldown again is back to normal.\r\nSomeone is playing a prank on me, this can&#039;t be real. I spam my Q for more poke, but all i hear is a &#039;not ready&#039; SFX spamming my ears instead.\r\nPerhaps this is a slight glitch? Yeah must just be a glitch on the Q for URF. I wait for level 3, and faceroll. All my mana. Gone. Just gone. What is this nightmare i&#039;m in!!\r\nI try headbutting the screen, but it only makes the pain worse.\r\n\r\nI then stoop to the lowest of lows, something even low for a junkie... I rage quit. I actually bail on a game, and go to bed.\r\n\r\nURF is love. URF is life. I can&#039;t live in this normal world anymore.\r\n\r\nThis is my pain that I wanted to share with the group. Please share your misery if you also have been forced cold turkey into a world of normal cooldowns and mana usage. You&#039;re not alone friend, we can be here for each other.\r\n\r\n{{sticker:zombie-nunu-hearts}}","replies":[{"poster":"Roguestoney","date":"2016-09-27T03:17:15.072+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Riposa In Pace.","replies":[]}]}
