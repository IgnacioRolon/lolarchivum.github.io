I&#039;m average skill level/game knowledge, and I always try to win, but don&#039;t care for a loss either way. I&#039;m in this game for the laughs and entertainment value it provides. I ignore and will steer away from toxic or unstable people.\n\nIf you fit this bill exactly please add me, I wanna game with similar kind xD\nI play most nights after 7pm(ish) usually norms but happy to do aram/ranked all the same if that&#039;s the vibe you&#039;re putting down. Have 3 RL friends I commonly queue with but they are not always available, so i need some more chill peeps to play with &lt;3\n\nSo... {{champion:32}} wanna be my friend?","replies":[{"poster":"Tiz Arrior","date":"2016-09-02T21:18:23.306+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Aye, hit me up for some norms dude.
