Personally I think it's the best game mode and the rest are boring, but again, it's all subjective. So only ones own interest or lack thereof matters.\n\nI would just like to know when they plan to actually put it in the rotating queue.\n\nNever played doom bots either but the videos I've seen it looks like great fun.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Talon12","date":"2016-08-12T08:56:48.212+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Sloth Almighty,realm=OCE,application-id=FjGAIbRv,discussion-id=cTWryTP7,comment-id=00000000,timestamp=2016-08-12T02:21:47.732+0000)\n>\n> If you read all the comments in the weekly rotation thread they post, nearly all posts are people asking why urf is not on.\n> \n> So whilst your opinion is welcome, it&#x27;s all subjective.

Yea.. its coming to you, nearly there.\n\nAh you got it, they wouldn't release a mode when the just recently, intentionally released a broken champ (to sucker people into buying with RP, then gutting him down to level), his damage is high and his cds are only just bearable, rito thought for a sec and realised they shoudlnt let urf and the prenerf keld co-exist.\n\nAlso, if you click on the rotating game mode images you can see when URF is, its on after nexus seige","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"DannyMac","date":"2016-08-12T03:32:48.526+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"April, 2017","replies":[]}]}
