For plebs like me, extra IP reward would be great, but for those that have ample/too much IP well i&#039;m not sure what would benefit them. Perhaps even a couple LP would light a small fire in someones hunger belly?\r\n\r\nIf there is an incentive to take first blood, whatever the incentive may be, might make for some explosive game starts. Just a thought.","replies":[{"poster":"BarryButcher","date":"2016-07-29T09:59:47.865+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"I think it would be cool if they added like an \"achievement\" thing.

But I think your idea would be cool for the 99.99% of players who don't play professionally! that would be pretty fun. although they should just ban it for top laners because once a top laner starts to feed they just don't seem to stop. unless the jungler turns up to help out.
