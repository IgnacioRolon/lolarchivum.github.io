But what is now becoming apparent, is that I could count less than 50 champions which I&#039;ve seen in game so far. There would have to be two thirds missing from the available pool, so many i have not even seen! Whats the deal?\nNow its becoming exactly the opposite of why Riot changed it in the first place, &quot;same old boring champs&quot;. Well that&#039;s exactly what I am seeing, what&#039;s the deal??","replies":[{"poster":"JasonWazza","date":"2016-09-25T03:11:17.109+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"If you own all champs, you earn a reroll every game almost, so anyone that owns all the champs can reroll some of the shit picks, and on top of that, it's based only on the champs you own.\n\nYou're not going to see every champion, but you will see most champions at some point, which is better than can be said for regular URF","replies":[{"poster":"QAPLA","date":"2016-09-26T17:41:55.450+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=JasonWazza,realm=OCE,application-id=FjGAIbRv,discussion-id=J14R0HAj,comment-id=0003,timestamp=2016-09-25T03:11:17.109+0000)\n>\n> If you own all champs, you earn a reroll every game almost, so anyone that owns all the champs can reroll some of the shit picks, and on top of that, it&#x27;s based only on the champs you own.\n> \n> You&#x27;re not going to see every champion, but you will see most champions at some point, which is better than can be said for regular URF\n\nI can only assume that rerolls work the same as for ARAM, as I haven't played ARURF, but I get a reroll every game with far less than all champs owned.\nIt's 100 + 2x#of_champs_purchased (doesn't include default champs) or something, so once you have more than 75 champs purchased, you gain a reroll every game (it's 250 point per reroll ofc).\n\nIf you own all champs, you get almost 2 rerolls every game.","replies":[{"poster":"Sloth Almighty","date":"2016-09-27T10:48:29.308+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=QAPLA,realm=OCE,application-id=FjGAIbRv,discussion-id=J14R0HAj,comment-id=00030000,timestamp=2016-09-26T17:41:55.450+0000)\n>\n> I can only assume that rerolls work the same as for ARAM, as I haven&#x27;t played ARURF, but I get a reroll every game with far less than all champs owned.\n> It&#x27;s 100 + 2x#of_champs_purchased (doesn&#x27;t include default champs) or something, so once you have more than 75 champs purchased, you gain a reroll every game (it&#x27;s 250 point per reroll ofc).\n> \n> If you own all champs, you get almost 2 rerolls every game.\n\nI never knew this formula, thanks!","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Sloth Almighty","date":"2016-09-25T23:09:10.097+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"guess it must be a case of re-rolling and dodging, as a large amount of games for me have been returned to the queue from the lobby","replies":[]},{"poster":"BananaSlayerAMO","date":"2016-09-25T02:39:07.621+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Adding on to what has already been said, some champions are more popular and are owned by more players so that's why you see them more often.","replies":[]},{"poster":"hðnkƒørÇªmíllè","date":"2016-09-24T15:16:58.135+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Bro people reroll shit Champs/champs they don't want.
