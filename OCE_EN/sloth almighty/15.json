Those games where there are open Nexus on both sides and absolutely every player is vital to the win, and 1 single death will affect the push.\r\n\r\nGot to play one of those last night, 57min game final score 60 v 61 (a loss for us). This screen shot is one of many how close the game was for either side, Irelia back doored us while our attention was in front of base, 1 more AA would have finished this 10mins earlier. The nexus was on 68hp\r\nhttp://puu.sh/qUnh4/b279a97516.png\r\n\r\nThere was zero toxicity throughout this entire game, the odd friendly banter here and there, but when things got heavy it was strictly business for both teams and chat was quiet. There was flashy outplays and fantastic jukes, multi-kills and of course mistakes from both teams. The overall vibe was a friendly environment, every player felt important but was encouraged through a mistake, not flamed or ridiculed.\r\nNot a single person on our team was disheartened by the loss neither, because it was so close we knew someone had to slip eventually. Digital handshakes where exchanged all round at post game.\r\n\r\nThese are the kinds of games that make this game SO much fun to play, I literally find myself sitting on the edge of my seat with every decision either team makes. This is the kind of game that keeps me coming back, regardless of how good or bad I am playing. Even if it only happens every now and then.\r\n\r\nFor all the hate League can and does receive, you have to admit... This game is capable of producing some of the most fun gaming experiences you can possibly have!","replies":[{"poster":"Maraudaur","date":"2016-08-31T00:57:07.920+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"I love those 40+ minute games!
