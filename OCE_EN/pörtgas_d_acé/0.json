Champion designs, maps, game modes, have come and gone but the thing that will forever stay with League of Legends is the amount of Toxicity, Griefing, Afk&#039;ers, hackers. And Riot has done nothing but give us some sort of shitty &#039;instant-feedback system&#039;. I played with a malphite who fed bot lane, went afk mid game, kept trash talking and spam pinging, so after the game i decided to report him and i get a message saying that my account has been permanently suspended. WTF!!! Utterly pathetic, im moving on from this &#039;sad excuse of a game&#039;. Almost every game i get someone who is randomly toxic out of nowhere but is not punished. Riot has said SEVERAL TIMES that they&#039;ll fix this in the future but we all know that&#039;s just bullshit. Riot invests alot of money into the designing of the new client, champs and they don&#039;t focus on fixing the most important aspect of the game..... **THE COMMUNITY**","replies":[{"poster":"Gehirn","date":"2017-04-27T06:33:21.941+0000","up_votes":13,"down_votes":0,"body":"You're part of the community, and how you choose to respond to negative players who threaten to AFK shapes the community as much as they do. Your massively abusive response was enough to warrant a permanent suspension. You're impacting the game of the 8 other players when you do that, not just the person you're hurling abuse at for wronging you, consider that.\n\nYou might say that others who start negativity in game are the problem, not those who respond disproportionately, but you've been that person before and you've been punished for it.\n\nFor example:\n\n[3:29] Pörtgas D Acé (Yasuo): im inting now\n[3:30] Pörtgas D Acé (Yasuo): idc\n[3:33] Pörtgas D Acé (Yasuo): bout this game\n\nDon't be that guy. Who wants to play with that guy?\n\nOther chat logs from you are just so disgusting I don't even want to post them. It's no wonder the community reported you 100 times in a single month.

If my team mates were doing bad i would never flame them or run down my lane. The only reason why i would do such a thing would be in retaliation. The last game where i was suspended for 14-days was because i ran down my lane.....why?....it's not because i was tilted, it was because i kept getting trashed talked and flamed for doing my absolute best (i was around lvl 28 playing against a ranked, and didn't even have runes yet). \n\nLook Sir, I appreciate the time you gave to make a response but i wanna tell you one thing.....You wanna know why Im like this? You wanna know why I've turned into another toxic player?....It's because of this game and it's community. When i first started playing I was the silent one who wouldn't talk because i didn't really know my way. However there was a toxic yasuo who flamed lee sin because he insisted that he called jg first. This game made me into the toxic person i am. This game is nothing but a bad influence. This game will do nothing but teach you bad things, really dark (but creative insults). \n\n**JUST TYPE UP, 'MOST TOXIC GAMING COMMUNITY AND WHAT DO YOU SEE?????? LEAGUE OF LEGENDS RANKED AT #1**\n\nSo please....Do not lecture me and do not give me false statistics saying that i am the 000000.6% negative enough to get a perma-banned i could say **WITH CONFIDENCE THAT OVER 50% OF THE PLAYERS ARE TOXIC ENOUGH TO RECEIVE A PERMA-BAN**","replies":[{"poster":"Pörtgas D Acé","date":"2017-04-27T12:56:50.144+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":6,"body":"I know you are reading my logs and are probably thinking that im some disgusting immature child but please remember everyone bad i have said in those logs, all those insults, comments, racial slurs were taught to me, used against me by other players. I'm sorry but this game has made me incredibly toxic. I sometimes even use the insults i learned from this game against people irl. It's a bad thing. I'm embarrassed about my behavior and i regret all the toxic things i've said against other players (and i honestly hope they forgive me) I couldn't give a F*#(!  about getting unbanned because ik that's something that'll never happen but i wanted to apologize for the toxic things i said to the players i insulted and,  to the who are as toxic as me.....\n\nYou'll get yours soon.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Roguestoney","date":"2017-04-27T06:55:12.145+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I like your name.","replies":[{"poster":"Pörtgas D Acé","date":"2017-04-27T12:58:43.225+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thank You...
