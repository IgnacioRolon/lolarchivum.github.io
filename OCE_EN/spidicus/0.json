But Riot have put ANX in the same half of the Bracket as ROX. What is going on, my mind is blown.

ANX and ROX are in different sides of the bracket. The left side of the bracket is stacked and the right side is weak, SSG should make it to the finals this year though.","replies":[{"poster":"Spidicus","date":"2016-10-10T07:47:21.906+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thanks you're right. ANX and ROX are on different sides of the bracket. The official site was just all messed up at the time (for like 30 minutes after the draw) as can be seen by my above linked screenshot of the site. \n\nIt looks all fixed now, it makes sense. As for who plays what day, seems strange but I can't see an advantage as to who plays who on what day.","replies":[{"poster":"Warau","date":"2016-10-10T12:45:30.481+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"heard there was a team called \"Korean Destroyers\" is that ANX ?","replies":[{"poster":"Struggle","date":"2016-10-10T21:38:39.622+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"No the Flash Wolves had that tag until SKT tore them a new one and sent them packing yesterday","replies":[]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Warau","date":"2016-10-10T12:43:45.044+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It's weird I saw this LIVE.
