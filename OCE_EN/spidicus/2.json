Besides there is literally no way to get the system to work so that it excuses accidents because accidents can be staged, if they made it so DC from internet/power cutout didn't punish you everyone would just unplug their PC/Internet to leave without repercussion.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Spidicus","date":"2015-05-20T13:12:49.656+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":".... the system is still too harsh.\n\nThe main thing here being that I DC'd one rank game, out of hundreds.... the leaverbuster FAQ says you can get low priority que for leaving only one game. \n\nSo that's still shit.","replies":[{"poster":"ShuffledPancake","date":"2015-05-20T13:40:00.953+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Spidicus,realm=OCE,application-id=Ntey9fRZ,discussion-id=QpJenQkw,comment-id=0002,timestamp=2015-05-20T13:12:49.656+0000)\n>\n> .... the system is still too harsh.\n> \n> The main thing here being that I DC'd one rank game, out of hundreds.... the leaverbuster FAQ says you can get low priority que for leaving only one game. \n> \n> So that's still shit.\n\nIts not really harsh, you can send in a ticket or whatever if you were in a power outtage and they will remove it but its stupid to say its unfair","replies":[]},{"poster":"Niji","date":"2015-05-20T13:25:09.573+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Spidicus,realm=OCE,application-id=Ntey9fRZ,discussion-id=QpJenQkw,comment-id=0002,timestamp=2015-05-20T13:12:49.656+0000)\n>\n> .... the system is still too harsh.\n> \n> The main thing here being that I DC'd one rank game, out of hundreds.... the leaverbuster FAQ says you can get low priority que for leaving only one game. \n> \n> So that's still shit.\n\nOh well shit happens you can either deal with it or quit playing LoL because neither Riot nor anyone here likely cares about you getting low priority queue it's just the way things are some times.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Spidicus","date":"2015-05-20T10:35:07.768+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The system is still too harsh.","replies":[]}]}
