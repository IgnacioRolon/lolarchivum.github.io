I have a very small community of regular viewers, and I decided to do something special for christmas, thinking over a couple of weeks I might if I&#039;m lucky be able to raise $50 for charity.\r\n\r\nThis is a compilation of one nights stream. I wanted to share because people always say OCE community are toxic/trolls and while it very well may be the case, there are also some amazing people that donated to &#039;Save the Children&#039; this weekend. Thank you all so much. In one night we raise $114.50.\r\n\r\nI will continue to stream will all donations (if any) going to charity because its fun. If you want entertainment come drop by and say hi, if you want high quality gameplay PM me and I&#039;m sure I can refer you to some amazingly skilled streamers.\r\n\r\nInb4 shameless self plug - twitch.tv/spidicus\r\n\r\nCheers\r\nSpidicus","replies":[{"poster":"Maraudaur","date":"2016-12-18T21:09:50.599+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Awesome work mate!","replies":[{"poster":"Spidicus","date":"2016-12-19T00:01:03.568+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thanks man.
