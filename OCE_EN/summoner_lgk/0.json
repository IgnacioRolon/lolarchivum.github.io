I hear that League was having some problems on that particular version, though I also heard that it's since been fixed. If changing what version of iOS you have is a breeze for you, then I suggest seeing what happens on both.\n\nIf it isn't (I don't use Macs so I'm not too sure whether it's a simple button press or a whole day installation thing) then do the following:\nMake sure all of your systems are up to date. This includes your OS, graphics and sound drivers, and anti-virus. Try running League.\n\nIf it still fails, turn off your anti-virus and firewall. Try running League again.\n\nIf that fails, make sure that your account is an administrator. [Here's an article on doing that.](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201761974-Bug-Splat-and-Game-Crashes#mq3)\n\nIf absolutely all of that fails, then reinstall your game. Be sure to back up any item sets you may have, and back up your \"Config\" folder. That way you won't start completely from scratch.\n\nBest of luck.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Summoner LGK","date":"2015-03-04T09:51:29.362+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"common sum one? plz?","replies":[]}]}
