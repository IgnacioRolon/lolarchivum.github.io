Such as Discord and Steam forcing you to use 2fa via emails or mobile authenticators.  Gabe Newell's username and password are publicly available but nobody can login to it because only Gabe has access to the 2fa.\n\nOf course being aware of scams is common knowledge but the extra security is always helpful towards the people who might want the extra security on their accounts or aren't very good with the internet and identifying scams.\nBut it should be left as an option for the people who want it. If you don't want to use it then all good, no problems with me ¯\\\\_(ツ)_/¯.","replies":[{"poster":"Main Line","date":"2017-10-11T00:05:04.383+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I was bruteforce attacked a few months ago, and Riot restored my account after the hackers used the account with scripts to boost one of their friends in soloqueue.\nHackers are quite adept at getting around whatever password you have. I've done my research into how I got hacked with a 11 digit password with letters/numbers in it. They use all kinds of methods like scraping, bruteforcing with generators, wordlists, and even made their own account checking tools that exploit Riot's security.\nHowever an extremely easy fix that Riot shoud implement right away is to make sure all account are verified right at the start. Why have an option for unverified accounts in the first place? If accounts are verified, then the original owners can always get them back, and this deters hackers/sellers etc.\nTwo factor authentication could be implemented though, what's the cons to this?","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Jellytots","date":"2017-10-11T01:11:02.798+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"That's a pretty naive look at IT security JasonWazza.
