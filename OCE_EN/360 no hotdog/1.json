I got told in the comments that she has two many skins and when i think about it yeah she does. So I&#039;ve decided to put together a bunch of Yorick skins Ive found.\r\n\r\n- Crazy Cat Lady Yorick, ( i do have a link to it so check it out ) this is a skin that is a pretty smart idea, now the ghouls are 3 different types of cats with glowing eyes. instead of holding a shovel he is holding a large litterbox scoop and instead of having a lantern , he has a cat toy dangling above his head with a little light attached to it. \r\n\r\n- Gentleman yorick\r\n\r\n- Construction Yorick, This skin is pretty cool, you have a regular shovel, except he&#039;s wearing a safety helmet and a bright orange and yellow vest with a red shirt underneath , white gloves and a little construction light dangling above his head. One of his ghouls is a construction truck, another a bulldozer and the third a digger\r\n\r\nand there you go thats all I&#039;ve got for now peace out\r\n\r\nP.S This was quite rushed","replies":[{"poster":"Fitzky","date":"2017-06-05T13:00:20.333+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Wait someone actually listened to me and improved on my feedback?
