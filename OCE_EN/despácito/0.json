We don't have access to your logs here on the Boards, so we aren't the best place to ask if you're looking for clarification regarding your warning. Your best bet is to submit a ticket to Riot Games Player Support, and they'll hopefully be able to help you identify points where you need to improve upon. \n\nhttps://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/requests/new\n\nLet me know if you have any other questions!","replies":[]}]}
