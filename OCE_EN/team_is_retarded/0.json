So naturally, they benefit from building both AD and AP, preferably items which give both, such as Hextech Gunblade and Guinsoos Rageblade. \n\nNow kennen is a bit different since he only has AP scalings, so the natural way to build kennen is as a mage with AP items. However because kennens W works like this:\n\nPassive: Every 5 attacks, Kennen deals bonus magic damage equal to 40/50/60/70/80% of his attack damage and adds a Mark of the Storm to his target.\n\nPeople have worked out a way to build on-hit kennen with items such as Nashors Tooth and Guinsoos which gives him both attack speed for the ability and extra AP to deal more dmg with it. Basically the items synergise with his W and because he has cc in his passive and ultimate he becomes really dangerous when he can get a whole bunch of free autos off on you when you're stunned.","replies":[{"poster":"team is retarded","date":"2017-07-02T04:27:37.694+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"So hybrid kennen would be ap as?","replies":[{"poster":"Fitzky","date":"2017-07-02T10:31:04.391+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I don't play kennen at all just look up builds and guides on Mobafire but I'm pretty sure it's just items like Guinsoos, Nashors Tooth, BOTRK etc","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"TeCoolMage","date":"2017-07-02T07:48:52.868+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"AP kennen: burst and engage teamfights\nOn-hit kennen: split pushing and 1v1\nHybrid kennen: depends on items","replies":[]}]}
