Have you considered putting a kick option in the queue where the other teammates can decide if they want to play with these people? If not have you got any plans or ideas on how you are going to deal with these kind of toxic players im all ears.","replies":[{"poster":"SeibaPendragon","date":"2018-03-10T13:09:28.455+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"its annoying I understand trust me, had a guy say he was before a game once just thought he was kidding he fed mid lane 12 deaths... wish there was something they could do to refund LP or review the game footage.","replies":[{"poster":"WIZARD 0f AUS","date":"2018-03-10T14:02:38.118+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"its honestly just ridiculous the most recent player was on a loss streak if you're at a point where you say you're going to int feed the enemy its time to jump off and go cool down or go play a less serious mode where you can have fun","replies":[{"poster":"SeibaPendragon","date":"2018-03-11T00:04:55.820+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I think sometimes they forget its a COMPETITIVE game esp in Ranked.\n\nI ve had a lot of people say its just ranked, when Zoe came out I had people pick Zoe and feed mid lane. it just has no logic to me what so ever my logic would so go practice on bots or even just in norms not in ranked. \n\nbut again 99 percent of the worlds population is dumb as.","replies":[{"poster":"LegendOfswords","date":"2018-03-13T07:29:38.261+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Comes back to an issue a lot of people have been complaining about recently on the forums... Riot does not have a system in place to ban people quick enough for trolling and inting, abuse in chat? don't worry you will be permmed before you know it.. But you could legit go 1/10 in like 20 plus ranked games in a row with you getting reported every game before riot acts on said person.. even then probably not if they stop.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}
