I  advise you to stop playing for a couple of weeks until RIOT engineers have fixed their and got to making it working properly for at least 3 players in each team.\n\nI played a bot game lsat game, and every single player kept disconnecting with attempting to reconnect bug, I MEAN ALL 5 OF THE PLAYERS disconnected in my smurf account. EVERY SINGLE ONE WAS RAGING AT RIOT ON CHAT. There was even a plat player who said his frame rate drops and he disconnects but he reconnects quicker than the other players. \n\nSo stop playing cause u will loose games that u could otherwise win if half of ur team is not lagging.\n\nUr team players won't say they lagg in ranked cause it will make you give up easily, instead they feed and don't play much at all and do some random things. Especially they will get reported if they say they having an \"ATTEMPTING TO RECONNECT\" Bug. \n\nPLAY PROVISIONAL ONLY WHEN THEY IS LESS LAG ISSUES.\n\nCreate a smurf account in the mean time and play normals or ranked on them since u got nothing to loose.","replies":[{"poster":"HORSE OF FORCE","date":"2015-02-04T06:18:35.348+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You said \"every single player kept disconnecting\"\n\nand then follow it up with \"stop playing cause u will loose games that u could ... win\"\n\nBut let me present you this: If everyone is lagging, absolutely everyone, and you're in a PvP game with ten people, why would it be only your team has an increased chance of losing?","replies":[{"poster":"godsmustbecrazy3","date":"2015-02-04T21:32:23.950+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I don't care horse if you are trying to suck up to RIOT. \n\nRIGHT NOW AT THIS MOMENT I AM TYING, MY WHOLE TEAM IS STUCK ON THE GAME CLIENT CHAT. eVERYONE RAGING AND TYPING SINCE THERE STUCK THERE.","replies":[{"poster":"HORSE OF FORCE","date":"2015-02-05T06:29:34.761+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I understand there are server-wide issues, but my point is that lag will affect both teams, not just yours, and it's not always in a definite negative fashion.\n\nBut then again, the gods must be crazy.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}
