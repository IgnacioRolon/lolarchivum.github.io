Even though dynamic queue has already been launched; there's still some work to be done to implement the full team experience into this queue.\n\nSo to answer your question, the old ranked queue (the one where you _\"don't use solo queue rating\"_) has been removed from the game. It's slowly being re-integrated into dynamic queue.\n\nYou can learn more about all of this [here](http://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/miscellaneous/HGblb9fH-the-2016-ranked-season-updates-on-dynamic-ranked-and-your-feedback).","replies":[]}]}
