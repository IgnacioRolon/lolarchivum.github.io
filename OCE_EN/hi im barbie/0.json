I have never achieved anything decent (highest rank of Gold 3), but Ive still spent hundreds of hours playing the game and have spent hundreds of dollars on the game. Ive come to the realisation that this has been a complete waste, I feel since season 3 the game has devolved into something that has become utterly insufferable, Riot seems to be taking their game and the competitive scene less and less seriously. For example, the patch notes are now filled with stupid puns that I feel dont belong in something that is as serious as they should be. The patch notes determine the future of the game, one of the most important things Riot controls. I also used to watch every competitive game I could, but now the broadcasts spend 60% of the time either in waiting screens or talking about something that could be covered in half the time. I feel Riot have spent the last 18 months going down the wrong path with the game, this does not mean I know the right path or what path would be best for me to enjoy the game in the future, but with the way the game is now and the way its been heading I cant see myself ever coming back to League.","replies":[{"poster":"Ediwir","date":"2015-05-21T00:15:19.710+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'd like to remind you that we've had Annie Hastur, Trinity Force and the Brutalizer (1337g) since pre-season 1.\nAnd the game is called LOL, despite Riot owning the names D.O.T.A. and D.O.T.A.2.\nThe puns are part of it.","replies":[{"poster":"SEKAI","date":"2015-05-21T03:45:08.209+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Ediwir,realm=OCE,application-id=Ntey9fRZ,discussion-id=bU0JdyHs,comment-id=0003,timestamp=2015-05-21T00:15:19.710+0000)\n>\n> I'd like to remind you that we've had Annie Hastur, Trinity Force and the Brutalizer (1337g) since pre-season 1.\n> And the game is called LOL, despite Riot owning the names D.O.T.A. and D.O.T.A.2.\n> The puns are part of it.\n\nI really don't think Riot owns the names DotA and DotA2, it really isn't the case.","replies":[{"poster":"Ediwir","date":"2015-05-21T06:12:46.646+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Not DOTA, D.O.T.A.\nCame up a while ago when Valve wanted to make a game with that name.","replies":[{"poster":"SEKAI","date":"2015-05-21T06:16:20.005+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Ediwir,realm=OCE,application-id=Ntey9fRZ,discussion-id=bU0JdyHs,comment-id=000300000000,timestamp=2015-05-21T06:12:46.646+0000)\n>\n> Not DOTA, D.O.T.A.\n> Came up a while ago when Valve wanted to make a game with that name.\n\nName is Defense of the Ancients, it shorts to DotA.","replies":[{"poster":"Ediwir","date":"2015-05-21T06:59:32.445+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"And Valve could not use it :)","replies":[{"poster":"kJs","date":"2015-05-21T12:23:29.656+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Just looked it up and I think you're right. lol What is Riot going to do with it...","replies":[{"poster":"Ediwir","date":"2015-05-21T12:42:26.683+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Annoy Valve and Icefrog, so far :P","replies":[{"poster":"kJs","date":"2015-05-21T13:37:01.356+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"If I was Riot, I would make a name in League, the worst item you can buy for any role and name it D.O.T.A.

They need to add new features to the game to keep up with competitor moba games and to keep the league players intrested in the game. I do agree with the changes since season 3 have been very dramatic and they shouldnt have changed so much but its still a good game and i dont think you should quit now, or at least until any other big changes take place.","replies":[{"poster":"kJs","date":"2015-05-21T12:29:40.411+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I think Riot has no problem keeping ahead of player count with the other MOBAs. Dota 2 has significantly less players at any one time than League. Strife is a bad game relative to league with its inferior gameplay and graphics. HoN probably takes the price for having one of the worst, most toxic chat atmosphere of any Moba game. Other Mobas are designed to specifically appeal to only casual players, it won't have the same respect given as LoL since it has already established a very profitable, enjoyable and popular professional scene. \nSmite is becoming better though, it still feels very clunky for traditional MOBAs so maybe it won't ever beat LoL or Dota 2.","replies":[{"poster":"SEKAI","date":"2015-05-21T12:45:20.833+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You left out HotS that is pretty much bound to be at least somewhat successful riding on the name of Blizzard, and that Dawngate which was crushed by EA for whatever reason when it was actually doing quite well with its own spin on the formula.\n\nSmite is the door to the new scene in MOBA/ARTS, as evident by the coming of Gigantic.

You can completely ignore them and read the real information. \nRiot has actually been placing much of their buffs and nerfs around competitive/higher tier (Gold+) matches, they rarely nerf champions that pubstomp in SoloQ below Gold. An example of an exception is Jax. Many people now believe he had a counter all along in S3 but people didn't pick them; Malphite and any supertanks that can withstand Jax's relentless damage and still be able to farm and be useful for the team.\nPeople are saying Riven is very similar to Jax, can stomp SoloQ below Gold but is actually very counter-able.","replies":[{"poster":"hi im barbie","date":"2015-05-20T15:24:36.512+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"I agree that they do patch the game with the intention of balancing it for higher levels of play but I think casual players arent going to read the patch notes.","replies":[{"poster":"Chicken4dinner","date":"2015-05-20T23:21:16.936+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=hi im barbie,realm=OCE,application-id=Ntey9fRZ,discussion-id=bU0JdyHs,comment-id=00000000,timestamp=2015-05-20T15:24:36.512+0000)\n>\n> I agree that they do patch the game with the intention of balancing it for higher levels of play but I think casual players arent going to read the patch notes.\n\nI do","replies":[]},{"poster":"kJs","date":"2015-05-20T15:45:20.523+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"What's your point exactly?
