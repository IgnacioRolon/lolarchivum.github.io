NOTE: MUST RESTART BY ITSELF OR IT WILL NOT WORK, FORCEFULLY SHUTTING DOWN USING THE POWER BUTTON WILL NOT WORK.\r\n\r\nAlso, fyi, once you had to shut down and restart your windows 8 computer for a couple of times without doing this process, it may revert to its retardedness before where you will experience dcs once every 2 minutes. So, be mindful to do this process if ur windows 8 computer needs to be reminded that its an OS after all.\r\n\r\nAbove is all, the wisdom of my findings on the net on solving windows 8 problems, i have not had a dc ever since, that was 2 months ago, and now i share with you this wonderful fruit that cures windows 8&#039;s many downs.\r\n\r\nThanks for reading.","replies":[{"poster":"GoldenTomat0","date":"2015-04-16T03:49:13.716+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"yeah it's your trash net, not windows 8.
