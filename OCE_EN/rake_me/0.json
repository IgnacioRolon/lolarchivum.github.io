Hope everyone is having a good day and stuff. I wanted to play some league with a friend today and someone made the game I played very unenjoyable to the point where I just don&#039;t even want to play anymore today. I did the classic report at the ending screen, but he just went off some more at me for no reason. I don&#039;t want to post any pictures here to &quot;name and shame&quot;, but I just wondering how I can contact Riot or Riot Support so that something can happen. This guy is just going to ruin other people&#039;s games today for sure.\r\n\r\nThanks!","replies":[{"poster":"Mortis Ex","date":"2017-01-04T04:58:06.335+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"If you have screen shots and stuff you could try a support ticket. The system tries but often doesnt pick up things, lots of people instantly leave after game and dont report coz they want to move onto the next game after the frustration, or even report the victim of harassment when they finally blow their top after being trolled for 20 mins.","replies":[]},{"poster":"gravityhacker","date":"2016-12-25T05:16:29.000+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I don't think you can do any more than blocking the player and reporting them, if they do t his constantly, the system will flag them and they will be punished.","replies":[]}]}
