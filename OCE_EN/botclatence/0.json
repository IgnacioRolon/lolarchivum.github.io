Please just make it so you can disenchant the hextech chests into 5 orange or blue essence, please I&#039;m begging you.\r\nThanks BOTClarence.","replies":[{"poster":"Vhaegor","date":"2016-10-17T10:52:39.506+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Idk why haxtech crafting is so unnecessarily complicated. You need to get key fragments and chests, makes the keys, unlock the chests, hope you get something even good then get enough dust to actually make the thing. Loot is way better in Overwatch, just open and its yours.","replies":[]}]}
