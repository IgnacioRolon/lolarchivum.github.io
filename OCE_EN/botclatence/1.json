ANYWAYS so we were playing and not even 10 seconds in the gragas on our team flames my two diamonds friends saying they got boosted to diamond and already calling them animals such as &#039;monkeys&#039;, i then defended them by saying he is stupid and asked all chat to report them. I&#039;m making this as a plea, please to revoke my Perma Ban, i played two - three games and i got reported once by the gragas because he was flaming and feeding. I also had muted him fully pings and all for 10 MINUTES, because of how toxic he was, after the 10 I decided to un mute and try and talk to him, but by sheer disgustingness he was already flaming all chat and my diamond friends as well as me. Then furthermore raged but only as he was still being toxic as f**k, the other team had even told him to shut up as he was only speaking in all chat. Please I beg, I have put the time into getting out of bronze and adding funds towards my account for skins and mystery skins for friends. I plea for at least a chat restriction as they do help me from being less toxic as i can only say 5 messages max and can&#039;t speak in all chat, I acknowledge that I could&#039;ve muted him but I already muted him and tried to talk to him, but he then purposely fed an d admitted it in chat further throughout the game, please.\r\nThank You for Reviewing this.\r\nBOTClarence (James).","replies":[{"poster":"MOOROSCOW","date":"2017-12-19T11:57:55.351+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"Riot system is a joke this is not fair at all dude","replies":[{"poster":"cuckboii","date":"2017-12-22T11:39:00.540+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"They're certainly *removing toxicity* in some way but like I read in another comment, they're treating a diseased toe by cutting your leg off at the hip.","replies":[]},{"poster":"BOTClatence","date":"2017-12-19T12:58:41.813+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=MOOROSCOW,realm=OCE,application-id=T8eq2lFQ,discussion-id=E3QOI7WE,comment-id=0000,timestamp=2017-12-19T11:57:55.351+0000)\n>\n> Riot system is a joke this is not fair at all dude\n\nHERE HERE","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Essembie","date":"2017-12-30T22:08:59.448+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I always wanted a \"dont put in my team ever again\" button, perhaps with a set quota (like 5) you can use in any given season.","replies":[{"poster":"BOTClatence","date":"2018-01-01T01:59:00.991+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Essembie,realm=OCE,application-id=T8eq2lFQ,discussion-id=E3QOI7WE,comment-id=0005,timestamp=2017-12-30T22:08:59.448+0000)\n>\n> I always wanted a &quot;dont put in my team ever again&quot; button, perhaps with a set quota (like 5) you can use in any given season.\n\nyea i actually would like that except 5 isn't enough i reckon","replies":[{"poster":"Essembie","date":"2018-01-04T23:52:16.890+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=BOTClatence,realm=OCE,application-id=T8eq2lFQ,discussion-id=E3QOI7WE,comment-id=00050000,timestamp=2018-01-01T01:59:00.991+0000)\n>\n> yea i actually would like that except 5 isn&#x27;t enough i reckon\n\nthe idea with limiting the number is so that it was only used in extreme cases and not just because someone called you a poopy head.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"BOTClatence","date":"2017-12-23T03:46:52.743+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Wouldn't matter some idiot from EUW replied and he said no bad luck u have been given warnings, so I just bm'd him and riot, couldn't give a shit tbh, riot are just bitches thats it","replies":[]},{"poster":"Essembie","date":"2017-12-22T11:23:29.769+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"2017 is when riot killed league.","replies":[]},{"poster":"cuckboii","date":"2017-12-22T10:55:31.680+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"No, that would make them more toxic.
