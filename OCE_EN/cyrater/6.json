So pretty much i started recording everyones names into a list that I check each time in champion select and i know its worth it than to play with those people. its honestly so sad that it comes to this. I&#039;m typing this right now in game where someone got ** autofilled support** so they pick yi with cleanse and smite and just smited my first buff and then insta gave it to enemy mid laner.\n\n I know that my entire team and some from the enemy team might report (although I doubt this because they got a free win) but he won&#039;t get banned because Riot doesnt care if people do this for only one game despite all the proof, like saying &quot;so im supporting the enemy team&quot; aswell as the game recording that shows him just smiting my camps as I try to do them. He claims to have an account in challenger, anyway my point is this worse than any toxic player, toxicity is mutable but purposely feeding and ruining a _ranked_ game is just appaling and the worst part is this person will get 0 punishment for it.  The boards say no witch hunting which is kinda dumb because it so easy to just check the posters match history and see which person they are talking about. In summary I urge you to avoid this person at all costs and also try creating your own dodge list.\n\n\n_EDIT: Yeah after my entire team and some of theirs reported yi, look who i got in my next game _\n\n\n_Image Removed_\n\n\n\n\n.\n>                            ** REPORTING DOES NOTHING, GET A DODGE LIST**","replies":[{"poster":"Miicka","date":"2016-12-29T01:58:52.645+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"What makes you think Riot do nothing about these kind of people?\n\nThe majority of people who intentionally feed do it as a one off, maybe they had a bad day, or just felt in the mood to be a total dick, and it was wrong of them to do what they did, but just because they did it once does not mean they should be banned or even punished. However, there are many players who intentionally feed on a regular basis, and these players do get banned.\n\nYou might argue that the tribunal system isn't harsh enough, or doesn't always pick up on these kind of players, which is entirely true. But can you imagine having to monitor millions of players every day? I don't think it would be easy, and the current tribunal system is the best we can get in terms of punishing players who don't follow the summoners code.\n\nAs for naming and shaming, this is obviously subjective, opinions will vary from person to person. People want some privacy, and I don't think they would appreciate other people shit talking them on the boards.","replies":[{"poster":"Cyrater","date":"2016-12-29T02:30:49.587+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yeah a one off means nothing but if you saw the Edit and the picture it shows that despite him doing that in _one_ game he was about to do it in another and this is just one instance, the purpose of my dodge list that contains roughly 30 names is that not a single one of them get banned but or even punished, my post isnt to complain about the yi my point was about everyone making their own dodge list because Riot's \"method\" of dealing with people like this is terrible.","replies":[{"poster":"Spidicus","date":"2016-12-29T05:33:07.842+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"You could rename to \"CryAter\" to better reflect your personality.\n\n:P jk\n\nIf they do int feed they should drop in rank and you shouldn't even have to deal with them again.

Of course they deserve to be banned. I don't know about being permanently banned for a one-off, but a ban nevertheless.","replies":[{"poster":"DipperOCE","date":"2016-12-30T05:57:14.166+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Not helping to win is not worthy of a ban, intentionally losing is worthy of a ban.
