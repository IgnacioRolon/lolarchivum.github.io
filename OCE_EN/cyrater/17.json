This isnt even bronze or silver where they do this,(although i know they do it there too).  The amount of games I&#039;ve had where they call AU dogs or other rude names then jsut feed lane, these guys were flaming in champion select and its my fault for not dodging. I purposely dont play late at night to avoid these people. This isn&#039;t a witch hunt, (although these people deserve bans for feeding, racial slurs and offenseive language). Its to warn others about it. It&#039;s not the first time this has happened or the last.\n\nEdit: Next game 20mins later, I get more chinese, and this is what they do http://i.imgur.com/CK2MvGW.png","replies":[{"poster":"Roguestoney","date":"2016-07-22T08:54:58.927+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The trash in that game aren't setting a great example either...","replies":[{"poster":"dragon poo","date":"2016-07-22T12:47:08.007+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"To be fair, they are right, there are Chinese servers for that exact reason.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"kaboomblah","date":"2016-07-22T10:36:18.679+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"It's their culture. Only now are they lifting the one-child policy over there. It's the country that gave rise to the term \"little emperors\".\n\nBasically, they're treasured and coddled by their family from birth.\n\nSo, yeah, as you can imagine, criticism is not taken well, haha. That's why they will flip out and feed/afk at the drop of a hat.\n\nExample:\n\n\"Yo, that's enough feeding man.
