Because of the policies in-place at Riot, you will likely get a generic response and will not be informed of the result of the review.\n\nI hope they get hit with something, though, as that behaviour is unacceptable.","replies":[{"poster":"Justaguy","date":"2017-11-26T04:45:32.801+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Though I've very rarely seen any action taken on crap like this.

While I don't outright agree with that, I do think there is some truth to it, and that it often happens (or at least, seems as though) that the Player Behaviour team are not doing their job.\n\nOne thing to consider, though, is that Riot *definitely* wont do anything about toxic behaviours if they're not aware it's happening. At least by reporting it, you're making certain Riot are aware and if something isn't done, it's all on Riot, and complaints are more than fair.","replies":[{"poster":"Hacks4Dayz","date":"2017-11-26T09:12:15.659+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=HeartVine,realm=OCE,application-id=T8eq2lFQ,discussion-id=bIW6Rzoq,comment-id=000400000001,timestamp=2017-11-26T05:15:53.121+0000)\n>\n>complaints are more than fair.\n\nReally thou, When was the last time Riot even posted on the forums on the OCE.\nOCE to me just seems like \" Give them OCE board and we wont have to deal with it, Make a few green posters.
