Or two people call at the same time and they both say they called it first (even though riot already changed this). \r\n\r\nMy suggestion is to make it so when you first call a role you get the little symbol next to your name in the champ select. If you call any combination of mid, middle, midd, or more then you get the mid symbol shown in the picture. whomever calls it first gets it no matter what, if you join late and see no one calling it won&#039;t matter because you can see the symbols near each person&#039;s name. In this picture it shows Person 1 calling mid and person 2 calling mid; person 1 called it first and gets the symbol person 2 can no longer argue that he called it first then since other roles are called he calls sup and the sup symbol. This system isn&#039;t perfect and I havn&#039;t thought about how Fill would work yet. But it&#039;s just a suggestion because we in oce are sick of blind pick and since riot won&#039;t be bringing draft pick here anytime soon we may aswell get this change. As far as I know the new client doesn&#039;t change blind pick but i dont know for sure.","replies":[{"poster":"Tele","date":"2016-08-11T07:56:27.996+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Smite adc report pls...\n\nXD I like the idea though. As far as I know every server uses the \"Calling rule\" so it wouldn't even be something just for OCE, it would have use on other servers as well.","replies":[{"poster":"Cyrater","date":"2016-08-11T11:07:29.664+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yes but other regions have draft pick for normals, OCE is stuck with only Blind pick","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Jackie Frags","date":"2016-08-11T11:08:40.512+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"id like the new teambuilder for ranked, why not have this type of system where they can call their lane beforehand, that way theres no problems picking, making the whole system less toxic.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Shroom","date":"2016-08-11T10:02:31.568+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Not a bad idea...","replies":[]},{"poster":"Hex caster","date":"2016-08-11T09:48:41.961+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Make it happen Ritoo {{sticker:slayer-jinx-unamused}} ","replies":[]},{"poster":"TheOneUser","date":"2016-08-11T09:25:47.187+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"basically, bring back teambuilder...","replies":[]},{"poster":"SuperGawp","date":"2016-08-11T08:06:32.811+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Wow, that's actually a really good idea haha, good job.
