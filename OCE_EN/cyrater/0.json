I'll chase up an answer for you.\n\nEDIT: Looks like they just updated the NA thread\n\n>UPDATE, 5:54 p.m. PST: Well, looks like we jumped the gun here. Unfortunately, as the service came back up we ran into a lingering error within the store that causes transfers to fail, which will take the weekend and possibly a little longer to fix. Transfers should be up and running as soon as possible, and once I get a more concrete timeline I'll let you know. Thanks for enduring this twisting, magical journey with us, folks. Apologies again for how messy it's been.\n\nhttps://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/general-discussion/5WGM17ul-update-account-transfer-service-back-online","replies":[{"poster":"Cyrater","date":"2019-01-27T03:51:52.132+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Ah yes I see now, Yeah it just seems they didnt update the client notification or the website.","replies":[{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2019-01-27T03:55:12.864+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Best just to keep an eye on this thread for updates: https://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/general-discussion/5WGM17ul-update-account-transfer-service-back-online\n\nIt's been a bit of a rollercoaster with some pretty not-great communication.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]}
