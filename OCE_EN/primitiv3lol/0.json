So, they might of reported me for toxicity. Riot has banned me, because one person has reported me for things that THEY caused, they kept calling me a retard, and sure I lost my cool, but they didn&#039;t listen to the team and turned the game into a 4v5 which annoyed me AND my team. I am getting PERM banned because someone is annoyed, yet they didn&#039;t mute me, and they might not have had the chat filter on so that they don&#039;t see these words. If I got chat banned, I wouldn&#039;t care, If I got a 2 week ban, I wouldn&#039;t care. BUT a permanent ban is way too over the top. Please reduce this ban to something else. I&#039;ve spent too much money on this game to let it go and I won&#039;t.","replies":[{"poster":"SephirothSG","date":"2016-04-02T08:23:15.303+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":">I accept the fact, that my 2 chat restrictions and two week ban was fair\n\nYour behaviour was consistently negative enough to get you three punishments so far, the system made it very clear that if you did not reform your punishments would continue to escalate.\n\n>Please reduce this ban to something else. I've spent too much money on this game to let it go and I won't.\n\nPermanent bans are not reduced or removed unless they were made in error.\n---\n\nFrom what you've bolded in the chat log you've posted, you seem to have a misconception about the nature of negativity. Swearing/bad language does not always mean negativity, and negativity does not have to involve swearing/bad language.\n\nImagine if you were on the receiving end of all this hate, how would that make you feel?\n\n>u fucking serious\nu ever played poppy?\nPOPPY\nBE USEFUL\nretard\nu obviously dont know what ur doing\nzz\nno\nur dumb\nand think u know what ur doing\nSHUT THE FUCK UP\nyou shit %%%%\nim going mid\nfuck u poppy\nslut\nsorry\nur just\nmaking me mad\nfor fuck sakes\npoppy stop\nyou are wrong\nin every aspect\nur so bad\nomg\n\n\nAnd it just goes on and on, never ending constant hate toward this Poppy? What if she was having an off game? What if the player was new to the game? Imagine you were in that situation, having a bad game and someone started verbally abusing you, would it put you even further on tilt?\n\n>I'm getting banned for flaming at one person, which I APOLOGIZED FOR!\n\nYou continued to abuse and berate the Poppy even after apologising.\nRemember, **sorry** is just a word if you dont act on it.\nThe same can be said about your ongoing negative behaviour.\nYou ignored your first three warnings, you have demonstrated no desire or conscious effort to reform, and continued to demonstrate extremely negative behaviour\n\nDo feel free to make a new account and start over, just remember that punishments may be quicker to ramp up if this kind of behaviour continues.\n\nDon't forget, actions speak louder than words, if you truly intend to reform, then demonstrate that on a new account.\nProve to the community that you can be a better example. It won't get your account back, but you won't ever lose it again to negative behaviour","replies":[{"poster":"Catspeare","date":"2016-04-04T00:53:33.193+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"Preach it :)","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Mars Support","date":"2016-04-01T19:39:31.012+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"You're getting banned for continuous cases, not as a result of a single game.","replies":[]}]}
