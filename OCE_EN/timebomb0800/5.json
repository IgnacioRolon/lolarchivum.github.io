I made a list of achievements that could be implemented if they ever decided to use the achievement tabs. I was planning do it for all champs at the time but never got around to it. Rather than just delete it though, I thought I might share it to see what people would have thought about it :) Just gonan copy and paste all the text from the file.\n\n\nAchievement Ideas! (Achievement list and names for all champions)\n\nSo that poor little achievement tab under everyone&#039;s profile has been a sad lonely deactivated tab. I think we can all agree of how nice it would be to finally make use of it (of which I&#039;m sure, or at least hoping, Riot is planning on using during Season 3). After seeing another related thread, I decided to come up with some ideas for achievements. \n\nWhile constantly earning achievements is more a Valve thing. I personally would prefer that if they did implement the feature once and for all, that the achievements would actually feel like ACHIEVEMENTS. Not crappy little things like valve does and have achievements for &quot;Buy the Bloodthirster&quot; (as an idea mentioned in previously seen thread) sought of thing.\n\n___\n\n#**General:**\n\n* Thing like win a game with 50% of the champs and perhaps one for 75% and 100%\n* Get a 10 normal or ranked win streak.\n* Earn 50 honour points in Friendly\n* Earn 50 honour points in Honourable opponent and so on. Of course those numbers could be higher as honour system has only just come out.\n* Win a game(or something like 10) with each champ that has the e.g &quot;Assassin&quot; tag. Then that could unlock like an assassin icon or something and show that you like assassins or somewhat and so on for each tag or win 10games with the champs with this tag.\n\n____\n\n#**Champ specific:**\n**They&#039;re Mine Now** - As Ahri, land charm on a male character 100 times.\n**So Many Noobs...

I hope some day Achievements work their way back into league of legends, impacting on those who play, making it all a generally better experience for all players.\n\n~Moo","replies":[]}]}
