Are using their account on a different computer/new computer to what they normally use\r\nand 2. Have had to re-install LoL on their computer for whatever reason.\r\n (As their are already enough settings users have to change when they re-install. Maybe user account settings could be kept with the users account to?)\\\r\n\r\n\r\nThank You for reading and I hope the guys at Riot see this :)","replies":[{"poster":"Faelaren","date":"2014-12-10T09:44:50.615+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The reason I think they don't do this is because they would have to store it on their servers which would mean that it's more data they have to maintain.
