Please Read :)","subforum":"Clubs","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey guys, I want to create a club on the Oceania server for non-toxic and friendly players. Back before we had our own server, I was part of a group on the NA server called &quot;The Gentlemen&#039;s Club&quot; . It was full of players who never raged, were friendly, and had never been banned. As that club name seems to be already taken on our server, I have created a new club called &quot;Make Love, Not War&quot;, a slogan that was commonly used for back in the 1960&#039;s by people who were opposed the Vietnam War.\r\n\r\nIt will be a club for all friendly and/or non toxic players of all ranks where you can find players to queue up with that you know won&#039;t be toxic. If any reports of toxicity of players that are in the club, they will be reviewed and removed from the club if I deem fit to do so. Add my IGN: Timebomb0800 to join :)\r\nEDIT Note: Feel free to get friendly players you meet in games, or people you already have on your friends list to add me if they want to join, given they aren&#039;t toxic of course :)\r\n\r\nI&#039;ve already posted this on the &quot;Summoners&#039; Society (League of Legends OCE)&quot; Facebook group and am having great success so far!","replies":[{"poster":"Lowrider","date":"2017-12-09T09:42:07.999+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"could i join?","replies":[]},{"poster":"Kiean515","date":"2017-07-28T09:00:59.683+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Too late to join?","replies":[]},{"poster":"Twinkles","date":"2017-07-08T01:36:42.956+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Do you guys still want people to join?
