They're a learning tool for the very early stages of learning league. Not much reason for them to invest in upgrading the bots, and tbh with the botting farm accounts, being in a 1v5 with 4 mobi boots run it down mid bots (shorter games help them level up faster), and trying to 1v5 fight for the win is challenging enough for most gold players even.","replies":[{"poster":"Maaron","date":"2018-05-28T07:45:20.946+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"If you have trouble 1v5 the bots, something is wrong with your gameplay.

For Adcs you have the fact that bots don't understand range and will let you auto them for free. For Bruisers, you have the fact that the bots aren't good at peeling and so you mow down the backline ezpz. For Assassins, you can outplay, and bots are simple. For mage supports see mages. \nFor tank supports and low damage defensive tanks, you either build any damage that works with your kit, or you accept you're done because the 5man deathball is especially deadly, considering statwise they stand on equal ground to you.\n\nDepending on what champion you are playing and which bots you're playing against (some of the Intermediate Ai's get suicidal post 15min) this game of one competent human +4mobiboots chains vs 5 very simple but fed Intermediate Bots, can offer a challenge range between high bronze to mid gold in terms of difficulty.\n\nLast season I had 2 accounts in mid gold as either this Jung/Sup, or my alt the Top/Mid where I discovered that role can influence ego and toxicity, and I have in fact lost, one of these 1(-4) vs 5 bot games whilst I was levelling that alt.\n\nAlso this season I am currently stuck in Silver 2. Don't decide to try out new champions during placement games, you will kill your mmr.","replies":[{"poster":"Maaron","date":"2018-06-02T03:59:15.218+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I know what you mean when you say: \"don't decide to try out new champions during placement games, you will kill your mmr\". This goes for all ranked games, not just placements. That is the whole problem. \n\nThe game at the moment is such that it is extremely hard to find a decent game where there are no players who get triggered or aggro at you because they think you are bad. I find this to be extremely tilting, making it hard for me to even get a decent game on the champions I want to practise.\n\nThis goes for normal games too. If you try out a champion first time in norms, and you play badly, you will get flamed so hard that you don't want to play anymore. The LoL community is just like this at the moment. \n\nThis is why bots are a good tool to practise new champions and your mechanics on them. Bots are AI, so they don't get aggro at you and they don't tilt you. \n\nOverall, I believe that it would be worth the effort for Riot to try and introduce 'hard difficulty' bots. Or, if that is too much, at least try to fix the 'run it down mid mobis' bug that is currently plaguing 'intermediate' bots.\n\nP.S. Good luck climbing out of S2. I know how it feels - been stuck silver for a while now. {{sticker:slayer-pantheon-thumbs}}","replies":[{"poster":"Nightjar","date":"2018-06-03T11:54:07.602+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"the run it down mid mobi bots aren't a bug... they're a program run by people selling fresh accounts. They make new accounts with randomnamexrandomnumber, and then they have these accounts powerfarm Co-op vs Ai, with the aim of losing a game as quick as possible to maximize xp farming.\n\nIn practice this forces a real player faced with 4 of these on their team, to go into a solo top or bot lane against 2 enemy bots, which is very hard to snowball off hard enough, to counteract the fact that you have 4 'allies' feeding mid at the fastest possible rate.\n\nThe botting accounts, is still very much an issue, because people still like to buy fresh accounts after their mains get banned, and as riot has already said, it's not profitable for them to focus on shutting it down.","replies":[{"poster":"Maaron","date":"2018-06-12T09:37:44.888+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"There has been a bug recently with Taric and a few other mobi boots bots that I have noticed.

Advanced bots that act like players are very hard to code.\nIf all you want is bots that do more damage, that's easy. But if you want bots that play well, that is a task that would take thousands of hours, and seldom be used, because this is a PvP game.\n\nIf you think that because they can do beginner and intermediate, that means they can do advanced, then you have no idea at all what you are talking about.\n\nI'm no developer, but I have beta tested games, and had entire patches implemented solely on my feedback.
