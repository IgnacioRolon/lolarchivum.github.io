I think you're misunderstanding the purpose of honour. \n\nHonour is meant to be recognition for playing well or being a good sport or x other honourable thing. It's not meant to be a reward for you just because you want it. You have to *earn* your honour. If it was easy to get it wouldn't mean anything.","replies":[{"poster":"Chode Gath ","date":"2018-03-28T10:28:08.128+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I honour people that I think is honour worthy of it, but if I feel like the whole team is trolling I still do it because skipping it is unsportmanlike.

Some may honour for just not being toxic, some honour just for playing well, and some may only honour those who go above and beyond to be positive. If you don't think anyone deserved honour, don't honour them.\n\nAs for bring back enemy honours, it's a feature I want to see back, but to implement it properly in the new system is a bit tricky. The new system thrives on the fact that people actually remember to honour (because of the giant popup). I want it back as a feature, but I'd rather wait and have it done properly than get some bandaid solution that just feels lackluster/meaningless.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Phos","date":"2018-03-28T10:31:39.192+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Sometimes your whole team don't deserve honours so punishing players for it would be stupid.","replies":[]}]}
