The link only shows the mechanics however not only using kogmaw, xerath as well as sivir, are champions that scripters use frequently which shows this. Sivir without fail being able to block instant cast skills (such as brand's E skill burn) or blind shots, or just by basic movements on being incapable of being hit by any skill shots at all. Like the discussion post i posted couple days back, there is a trend to all the players using violator programs. They were last season bronze, are in higher tier diamond to master/challenger, have high games played and percentages in kogmaw and sivir.    To see that this post was put up couple weeks ago and Riot mentioned that they supposidly started \"investigation\" into this issue, really proves alot. As well as he does not play with premades. Alot of the scripters play solo, unless another infamous duo of scripters who are ruthless and relentless using their scripts, not even attempting to pretend or hide the fact that they are. Probably because they know they will not be punished.\n\nIn other regions where i use to play, punished came alot sooner within days, not weeks. It's ridiculous really. Suspicion and allegations towards this person is not by individuals but by a large group of the community. The comments defending him (no offence) are in divisions lower or just people who haven't seen these famous people who have built a strong reputation for this. Really does ruin the gaming experience here and i'm not sure, but these faulty, 3rd program issues, lazy, etc, were things i've never experienced in regions elsewhere. Really makes me skeptical if the OCE region is actually capable of doing anything. \n*Out of suspicion, Faker had couple accounts banned for investigation of scripts. OUT OF SUSPICION THE INVESTIGATION WAS DONE EFFECTIVE IMMEDIATELY and his accounts were banned for the time being for investigation.*\nBut sadly, the helper/scripter issue does happen elsewhere. The other regions struggle with investigating as well because the players are a little more subtle in using these programs, and to investigate the numerous amount of players who do is probably too many as it has spread too far out of control. Although they still do get banned after a short period of time. When there is too big of a skill jump there should be some suspicion taken. Frankly RIOT has other plans for making the gaming experience better, i hope. \nI think they doubt it since it's a higher tier, there are wrongly accused lower tier players who have been banned accused for using 3rd party programs but happen to be a product of razor. RIOT responds to that one well. Seems like a business trip is delaying that as the time zones are different. Having one person responsible for all the issues must be tough. Probably meaning that higher tier players are less likely to use 3rd party programs in their perspective it seems. \n\nI guess what's more frustrating is that there is no action taken by RIOT to investigate properly. Like tag and watch, investigate replays. These allegations aren't made out of nothing. The attacking mechanics isn't what gives most suspicion, it's the movement/skill shot dodging which does. This especially during team fights that in laning phase. During the laning phase, it is understandable that one player may dodge many or all skills shots during lane, but during team fights and blind spots (cleared) brushes to dodge all incoming skill shots without fail? I think honestly needs investigating.  \n\nSadly RIOT will disregard this post as the \"Blame Name and Shame\" policy they have is awfully more strict than \"3rd party program users\" and they are strongly against people being publically scrutinized and exposure. So sadly enough the frustration will continue and no proper action will be taken yet (the yet that will last forever). The OCE region is probably one of the smallest regions and the slowest to improve regions out of the rest. Highly doubt seeing a team from OCE be successful in the World tournaments as this region differs largely from others in one too many aspects. One being that it is opposite to other regions as it draws people away from the region than drawing them in. No attraction, small community, and regardless of being small, too many issues. One day OCE will get there!
