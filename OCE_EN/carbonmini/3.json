When I win I gain only 10 or so lp and when I lose I lose about 20-27 lp. I&#039;m an ADC/TOP main with nice ADC win rates (Lucian, my main, 60% winrate). I&#039;ll be playing tonight at about 11pm to 1am today at Sydney time. Add me ingame with the name CarbonMini and comment down below which roles you can play. Thanks.","replies":[{"poster":"GORDONNODROG","date":"2016-06-26T10:25:24.107+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yo, add me GORDONNODROG Im S5 atm, Top and Jungle main.
