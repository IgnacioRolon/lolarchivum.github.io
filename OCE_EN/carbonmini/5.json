(Also Pentinum 4 from the last 7 years)","subforum":"Miscellaneous","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey!\nI&#039;m CarbonMini, and I use a AU$400 Celeron N2830 laptop. The Celeron N2830 is a low end Celeron, and its my only treasured toaster. This one makes the bread crispy by making the cpu REALLY hot. Anyways, some people out there have toasters just like mine. Pent 4, Athlon 64.... ect. These are a couple of tips to increase your toasters FPS performance by alot.\n\n1)Go to battery setting (right click on battery icon, choose power options) and choose High Performance mode. Maybe you already have done this, but it&#039;s good to check anyways.\n\n2)Go to advanced options in battery settings. Find &#039;Processor... ect.&#039; Tweak it up to 100%, and ur PC is ready to burn bread now!\n\n3)Press start, and search up &#039;performance&#039; and choose the first one, &#039;adjust performance and appearance of windows&#039;. Turn everything to for best performance, and there you go!\n\nThese worked for me, because i was munching on my toast with jam while playing LoL. Make sure you post pics of you toasting your bread in the DVD Tray! (If u don&#039;t have a DVD tray, stuff it in the heat exhaust of your PC/laptop. It&#039;s better in someways because you get extra dust on it!\n\nCarbonMini","replies":[{"poster":"TouchMyKimchi","date":"2015-05-27T14:05:58.671+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Biggest Gooftrooper Oce","replies":[{"poster":"She Loves Me","date":"2015-05-27T15:05:10.100+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"gooftroopers was the best fkn game <3 my childhood","replies":[{"poster":"TouchMyKimchi","date":"2015-05-28T09:04:47.766+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Wut?\n\nI never knew such game existed. \nAnd I've played a sh*t ton of games.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"CarbonMini","date":"2015-05-27T11:57:52.127+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey,\nButter is better than Jam.
