Now to get down to business from your match history you need a lot of learning i.e itemisation and reading passives and what items are used for melee/ranged champions ( ravenous hydra kennen don't do it). You need some practice you need to learn what to build and when to build it and cs;ing in lane, you obviously know how to get kills but getting cs and doing so is where you need to improve try to I'm for at least 120 cs @20 mins without getting killed or killing then add in the killing part and achieve both then try to set a personal best for most kills and most cs @ 20mins .","replies":[{"poster":"CarbonMini","date":"2015-05-27T10:54:26.403+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey, \nThanks for the advice.

Some of your builds are a bit questionable, and you'd likely do better if you bought more efficient stuff on the champs you're playing. Check out probuilds or a similar site for a better idea on this.\n\n- Try to get a couple of rune pages made once you unlock the good runes (at level 20 i think?), one for AD and one for AP is a good start. You will be at a disadvantage if you dont have decent runes, as they make quite a difference in early fights.","replies":[{"poster":"CarbonMini","date":"2015-05-27T10:53:13.635+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey,\n20 Minion kills = champion kill?

You're doing well, and that is excellent, but things will get a little harder as you approach 30. One of the reasons for this are you'll be up against people who are 30 and have access to lovely runes. Chances are, since you're doing well, you'll also be matched against people who are as fortunate. You'll see more of the toxic people once you're 30, but the best thing to do is keep positive and don't worry too much about individual games. Worry more about what you learn from those games, and how you can improve. \n\nAll in all, get a heap of practice in Normals before you move into Ranked gameplay. Try to learn each of the roles in the meta, at the very least you will need to know how to support. Sounds like you're off to a good start, good luck!","replies":[{"poster":"CarbonMini","date":"2015-05-27T10:51:46.149+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey,\nLast week, I used to get positive K/D/A s.

I ran straight into ranked when I hit 30 bc I had 136 wins ( thought that was great when I kept getting 8 winning streaks ect) and I got crushed, no good runes, no strategy and no team play. When you start to progress into the higher echelons of play (26 and above based on your probable mmr atm) it stops becoming a mindless kill fest, I watched a friend smurf (he is platinum 4 atm) against people in bronze (not a great comparison to you I know but I hope you catch my meaning) he went lee sin jg and did ok (7/4 at the end), the enemy sion in top was 16/5 by 20 minutes and very very tanky. He was crushing everyone and they couldn't face him down (mostly because they couldn't figure out how) but lee sin at 35 minutes turned around a losing fight against him (1v1) and the sion shat his pants and ran (and died). He thought he was unstoppable at first just because of his score, what he should have done is grouped with his team and focused turrets and squishes. They lost... As I said before its is not a mindless kill fest to victory, your score can be an eyesore but you can still carry and in the end all that matters is the win.\n\nNow, one other thing\nNo matter how good you are don't brag because there is someone who will be better then you (in your peer group)","replies":[{"poster":"CarbonMini","date":"2015-05-27T10:47:52.935+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey,\nSorry for showing-off.
