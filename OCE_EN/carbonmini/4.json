I&#039;m currently in B4 and looking to get into B3 by the end of the week.  However, I&#039;m getting bored of playing ADC over and over, but I&#039;m pretty good at it considering I have a 59% winrate on Lucian and an average KDA of 9.9/6.0/7.4 . I enjoy top lane alot with Illaoi but I have 0% winrate in the top lane. Im not very good at mid lane and I&#039;m horrible with jungle and support - and I would like to become a good jungler. How do I start off my journey to be a good jungler when your absolutely terrible in the lane? I find jungling boring asf, because I keep getting killed, underlevled etc.\n\nEDIT: 61% winrate actually :D","replies":[{"poster":"Roguestoney","date":"2016-06-13T21:27:20.123+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Main support. \n\nDon't let anyone ever tell you that supports cannot carry.","replies":[{"poster":"CarbonMini","date":"2016-06-14T09:02:40.094+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I find supports very hard to play.

I'm currently on my honeymoon so not much time.","replies":[]}]}]}]}
