This could be because Intel HD Graphics is 2 years younger than the Intel HD 4000, which would result in faster performance due to technology advancing. I think your laptop runs faster than mine is that you have an i5 and I have a Celeron, running at about 80fps on lowest settings.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"CarbonMini","date":"2016-04-17T04:16:46.633+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=CarbonMini,realm=OCE,application-id=Ntey9fRZ,discussion-id=dGldb6wP,comment-id=,timestamp=2016-04-17T04:15:43.428+0000)\n>\n> Heya!\n> So I have been playing on a $400 laptop for some time.
