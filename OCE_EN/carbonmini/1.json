It also increases queue times for ranked and normals which do not allow people who hate URF to play what they enjoy. Im currently 11 mins in queue, with not a single match found. Plz do something about this, and post your opinions about this subject down below. Thanks for taking your time to read this guys.","replies":[{"poster":"RegusThorn","date":"2016-04-22T02:04:19.837+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"U.R.F is the greatest thing ever.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Project Xayah","date":"2016-04-22T03:54:17.749+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"It's one weekend every couple of months, deal with it. This is a game mode that the vast majority of the community enjoys to some extent and they rarely get to play it, let them have their fun instead of being selfish.","replies":[]},{"poster":"EzeBlood","date":"2016-04-30T21:38:38.575+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Mate, I have had a 24 minute queue outside of URF hours. The rest of the community loves URF, so you can just deal with your 11 minutes and shut up. Go back to your shrine to Blizzard and level up your Paladin until they accept you as a staff member.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Maximum Spice","date":"2016-04-22T11:47:10.588+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"URF IS AMAZING!","replies":[]},{"poster":"Fitzky","date":"2016-04-22T03:52:24.948+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"URF is the greatest thing to have ever existed please remove yourself from the boards and don't ever come back","replies":[]},{"poster":"Shrewd","date":"2016-04-22T03:15:56.376+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I love URF.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Talon12","date":"2016-04-22T09:32:30.300+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"bob","replies":[]},{"poster":"Ripcord24","date":"2016-04-22T05:15:59.517+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Lighten up and have some fun!","replies":[]},{"poster":"OCE Yisus","date":"2016-04-22T03:13:53.957+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Sht up m8\n\n#dealwithit","replies":[]},{"poster":"Knuuckles","date":"2016-04-22T02:07:06.617+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":2,"body":"No fucking way m8","replies":[]}]}
