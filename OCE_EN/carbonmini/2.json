The reason I&#039;m posting this is because of some negative thoughts that always get into my mind during my league matches. So a couple of years ago, before my family moved in, there was a violent murder in my room which had left 4 people dead. Also, one of the 4 people killed was a kid around my age, whom was brutally smashed with a baseball bat till his face became unrecognisable. Scary, right? I&#039;ve lived in this house for 4 years, and good things have happened to me. I&#039;ve gotten into a great selective high school a couple years back, but the thoughts and imaginations of the family being killed keeps coming into my mind everytime I play a match of league. That makes me play terribly and makes me unable to concentrate. How could I possibly forget about the murders to help me play better? Also, would you live in a house where a family was killed in the room that u currently sleep in?","replies":[{"poster":"CHEESYLEEKS","date":"2016-08-06T11:28:29.966+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"> also, would you live in a house where a family was killed in the room that u currently sleep in?\n\nyes and id invest in one of these\n\nhttps://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/8e/English_ouija_board.jpg\n\n","replies":[{"poster":"CarbonMini","date":"2016-08-07T00:13:14.238+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Why would you invest in a Ouija board?

I imagine thinking about trying not to think about it makes it worse.\n\nAs a small suggestion, maybe play league somewhere else in the house? \n\nId also recommend speaking to a counsellor, they really aren't that scary at all, and your family won't think you're weird.

( I don't judge you for that but it's just kinda dumb) and secondly I would blast music on any music source ( Stereos, headphones) preferably stereos as music can ease your mind","replies":[{"poster":"CarbonMini","date":"2016-08-07T01:55:54.383+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Save 100k? We managed to buy the house for a lot cheaper because of the murder. Comparing it to other houses in the area, we got to save quite a bit of money. Also, I'm not a religious person. It's practical because of the amount of money we get to shave off the mortgage. Anyways, I'll try out the idea. Thanks","replies":[{"poster":"Erøse","date":"2016-08-07T04:06:21.724+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hhahah allgs. I lived in a house for 4 years that had a murder occurred in it as well. It just happened that it was in room as well. I always got chills and was disturbed by it and all I did was blast music and that solved my problem. We moved away from the house almost 2 years now. Let  me know if you want the full story of the murder case","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Sloth Almighty","date":"2016-08-07T02:09:37.938+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Tried counselling? It all depends on your mentality too. You're only 14yo, and please don't take this any other way, but you're still maturing and lack a lot of mental security to ignore/deal with something like this (if it is indeed legit).\n\nI'm 31yo (young birth of gaming generation xD) and I've reached my peak mental state where not much bothers me. I'm not religious, or believe in spirits or the after life etc etc, so it would be easy for me to ignore anyway.\nBut it just sounds like an age thing, counselling of some description might be worth a shot if nothing else.\n\nApart from that, smile politely at the trolls and enjoy your gaming regardless.
