You should start streaming and doing youtube before you quit school just to have a taste of it. I really put hard work into my videos and the first video I posted got only 200+ views (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chThbHaoLSM). Anyway you shouldn't think that you would get a huge chunk of money when you stream or do youtube because it ain't like that. Nothing comes easy so you really have to dedicate and commit 110% doing youtube or streaming. I actually thought of dropping out once but I didn't because what if my channel doesn't become big or no one views my stream? then I'm deadmeat and basically useless. So I decided that I would keep going to school and make sure I have a solid future while I still do my youtube videos and stuff. Not trying to be negative or anything but it is not 100% guaranteed that you are gonna be a huge time streamers or youtuber and the chances of your channel not growing is pretty high because of the amount of people that is already on the platform. However, best of luck to you and do what you think is right for you! \nRemember nothing comes easy and as long as you put your blood,sweat and tears into it then you will succeed.","replies":[]},{"poster":"YellowBrickRoad","date":"2016-08-31T05:45:56.685+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"As someone who youtubes as a hobby dont drop out.\n\nStart streaming/youtubing BEFORE you drop out.\n\nAnd dont go in with the \"Yeah im gonna get big and make money\" mentality, it doesnt work that way and you are only setting yourself up for disappointment.\n\nViewers wont enjoy your content if they can sense that you dont enjoy making said content.\n\nDoes this mean you cant do it as a job? No if you are good at it and you put in the effort it could work out.\n\nBut you need to have a job or some kind of backup plan in place incase it fails, its just like trying to make it in any entertainment industry be it a dancer or a musician, you dont put all your eggs in that basket or you will end up busking on the streets to make ends meet, but unlike a musician or dancer, you cant exactly busk as a video editor/streamer.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Melbounce","date":"2016-08-30T20:48:19.021+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"How To Get Big On Twitch As A Guy\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jX2u65AHZOM\n\nHow To Get Big On Twitch As A Girl\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KgffUcqHW1Q","replies":[]},{"poster":"VeganCrossfitter","date":"2016-08-30T08:03:50.544+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Ok I'll be the only adult on this page, don't do it. Statistically all of the major league streamers have taken huge hits in viewer counts, with many smaller streams closing out all together. I'm a business student, and trying to sell a product thats the same as everyone else in the same market is a recipe for disaster and one of the first things you will ever learn, which is exactly what you would be doing here. Finish your schooling man or pick up some other qualifications and work a bit, you'll find much more success there and far less disappointment. If you're deadset dedicated, try to find your own niche of game or style and do that in your free time, but stay at school kid.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Ace","date":"2016-08-30T04:54:41.133+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Idk man, Personally I wouldn't recommend dropping out of school, the way I see it is you should finish school and on your weekends or free days try to stream to get yourself going as the start is the hardest part, Also from what I know Streaming from Australia is garbage, internet here isn't great and the fact that the time zone difference to places like America differ so much getting a community would be quite difficult but hey if it does work out you'll have a hell of a time doing it.

Anyone can make it big in the stream scene, some offer something different to the rest to get recognition, some have a great way to connect to the audience, and some just simply strike it lucky. I wouldn't give up on your goal for a second.\nBut to dive straight into the deep end can leave you caught with your pants down if you don't have a back up plan.\n\nI had a very similar optimistic dream to be a professional Sprintcar driver (was 19 at the time). Laughable to most around me, but I was ready to drop life to achieve this, had been in the speedway scene since 15, had a chance to have a go. But my old man convinced me that keeping in my trade while doing this 'hobby' part time to see where it leads was the smarter thing to do. 4 years on I wasn't quite good enough for national standard or to make a living from it, thankfully I had my trade to fall back on.\nNow 31 and I own my own business, sure it's not where I wanted to be, but it's better than what could have been a worse alternative had I not kept something up my sleeve.\n\n\nTLDR; Stay in school, find a career/trade/back up plan. Stream in your spare time, if it gets to the point where its so big/popular its consuming your time, THEN make the decision to make it a full time thing. ALWAYS have a plan B :)","replies":[]},{"poster":"4fy9bEOt7y","date":"2016-08-29T11:49:36.253+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Rank doesn't matter. Look at half the popular YouTubers.

If you want to stream on the side __for fun__ with no expectation of success there is a chance you might find it enjoyable. Likewise, you might also find out that long stretches of 0 viewers are frustrating and that it simply isn't for you.
