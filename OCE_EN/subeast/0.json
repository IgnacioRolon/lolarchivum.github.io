Sometimes you lose because of an afk, thats just how it is. If you wanna climb focus on the games you can win, not the ones you cant.\n\np.s. from the match history you linked, you were losing lane and your team was losing the whole game anyway so an afk wasn't exactly the only reason you lost","replies":[]},{"poster":"Exhausted","date":"2015-05-07T00:18:14.352+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You get demoted for more reasons then that.\n\nSure i'll give you there can be AFK's in the game, lets say 2 out of 10 games.\n\nthat still means 8 other games are on you.\n\n\nif your duo, consider going solo, Duo Q is high risk low reward until you hit around mid plat range\n\n\nHigh risk is:\nyou face harder opponents to even out the advantage.\nyou put your team in a position where they face harder opponents then they are used to\nyou risk the chance of you or your duo being in a position of not getting the roles your strong in.\nyou risk being demoted quicker if your at 0lp.\n\nLow reward is:\n\nPlaying with friends (honestly if you want to play with friends consider making a 5s team)\nyour MMR spikes and drops harder.\n\n\n\nHonestly going solo imo is the best option.\n\nyou learn to carry yourself and in time makes it so you can carry your team in any situation.\n\n","replies":[]}]}
