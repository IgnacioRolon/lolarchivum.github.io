It also takes approx 3 months for your account to get back into good standing per tier (e.g, if you got 14 day suspension, it will take 9 months of A+ behaviour to have a clean slate again). Well I don't know what exactly counts as \"extremely toxic\" behaviour, you are a pretty big toxin in this game. \n\nA couple of things you did wrong at a glance: \n\n* Calling people idiots\n* Calling someone a toxic child that can't play (targeted abuse)\n* General negative behaviour (giving up)\n* blaming others\n\nI mean, I wasn't in the game and there is a chance that they were also being rather toxic towards you, but you should never meet toxicity with more toxicity.","replies":[{"poster":"mlEIbc93h7","date":"2016-04-13T09:17:46.440+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"Ah yes let me just ignore the 2 premades that are calling me a %%%% and tell me i have down syndrome and at the end of the game ill pray to what ever god exist cause we both know Riot wont punish them","replies":[{"poster":"Deep Terror Nami","date":"2016-04-13T10:04:58.344+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yes, you should definitely ignore them.

Extreme behavior such as hate speech and death threats may result in skipping punishment tiers, so most likely they are very close to or already have a ban for their behavior.\n\nRegardless of what they did or what their punishment might be, it does not justify your own actions.

If you cause grievous bodily harm to someone invading your property you can actually go to gaol for a lot longer than your assailant. In many cases of self-defence, you cannot 'attack back'. You must use the minimal amount of force you can to get away, run for it, and report the crime later. \nThe police themselves are taught to use \"reasonable force\", which is the minimum amount of force they can use to solve a problem. De-escalation of conflict is the biggest priority. \n\nIn this case, the minimum amount of force you can use to solve the problem of toxic players is to mute them and report if their behaviour has been bad enough to warrant that. By the spirit of the law, that is the appropriate method of resolution. \nIf they find a way to harass you once you've already muted them, that's the time to take further action by contacting Riot further.\nAlso, since the space of Summoner's Rift exists as a temporary public cyber space rather than a physical space within your own home, you are not defending property, so that comparison is really inaccurate. The law when it comes to defending oneself against slander, on a more relevant point, does not permit the use of slander in return. If you were to take someone to court for it, you'd lose out pretty quickly if they found out you'd used the same tactics.\n\nIf you have a problem with impulse control, honestly it's not Riot's problem to hold your hand through it and baby you through the consequences of your own actions--perhaps you should look into anger management tactics, particularly if your anger causes problems outside of the game.\n\nYou are a conscious, self-aware human being and you are capable of self-control.

It's at most 3-10 lines of code, cause most of the code they need is already in game. \n\nAt most they need to do is something like\n\"If box is ticked, then chat restrictions apply\"\n\nAdd a little more code so that actual punishments can't be turned off and there you go.

Even if that was hypothetically the scenario, that's still not lawful. You're still trying to justify behaviour that society has rejected and labelled as morally wrong. Riot is well within their rights to ban you based off that.\n\nThe existence of people who avoid responsibility and consequences for their words does not mean that we are incapable of controlling human nature. Willpower is admittedly a finite resource, but it's one that you consciously control up to that point. If you choose to indulge in lower behaviour or put yourself in a position where you will, intentionally or not, you are a worse person for it, and you have no one to blame but yourself.\nIf you life is so peachy that you only get toxic at people online, that doesn't mean your anger is contained or controlled like an adult. It just means you're used to getting things your way IRL, or that you're childishly failing to cope with something, and/or that you consciously or subconsciously believe that online public spaces are exempt from the rules that dictate physical ones.\n\nWhether or not that 'simple fix' of chat restrictions would change player behaviour, the responsibility of Riot to make their games better does not remove your personal responsibility to yourself and the safety of others.

It's designed to rely on and value synergy and cohesiveness of mind. You have to be able to deal with bad team mates without losing your own cohesion. Entering into a game is like a contract; you play by the rules, till the end, or you face the consequences. Just because you see others breaking them doesn't mean the rules have changed.\nIf you have one toxic player, you don't get better team synergy or waste your time any less by adding another one; you just make it more rotten for the three other people who have to endure it.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Project Xayah","date":"2016-04-13T20:24:37.989+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Don't make assumptions about \"hidden meanings\" where there are none, it just makes you look like a d!ck.\n\nDo you deserve a ban for being toxic?

I wouldn't say I have complete control over my emotions (and I'd say that no one else does either) but that is not the point I was making. One of the differences between you and me is that I accept when I am at fault, rather than simply trying to shift the blame to someone else using the childish excuse of \"they started it\".","replies":[{"poster":"mlEIbc93h7","date":"2016-04-18T00:40:50.133+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"Yea, that's what is called an assumption, something you assume based off the avaliable information. \n\nAgain, another assumption that I just \"abuse other because I want to\".  Like I said before if you knew me in real life you would fine that I have a pretty good grip on my emotions but like most people I do have times when that control slips and for me that is when I'm doing something competitive with a ranking system as I like to win and hate to lose, not cause the opponent was better then my team but because someone decided not to play the game correctly. \n\nI also don't remember shifting the blame, I even said in the original post that I was toxic, I only said I didn't deserve a perma-ban.","replies":[{"poster":"Project Xayah","date":"2016-04-18T06:41:00.049+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"You seem to not actually understand what defines an assumption, so here's the definition straight from the Oxford Dictionary:\n\n> Assumption *Noun*\n> A thing that is accepted as true or certain to happen, without proof.\n\nConsider that definition and kindly point out ***exactly*** where and when I have made these supposed assumptions.\n\n>  if you knew me in real life you would fine that I have a pretty good grip on my emotions but like most people I do have times when that control slips\n\nThis is a contradictory statement. Either you have a good grip on your emotions and impulses, in which case a likely possibility is that you're being toxic for the fun of it, or you don't have a good grip on your emotions and impulses, which would explain the consistent and frequent lapses that have lead to this perma-ban (and might  likely be explained as you not having attempted to learn self-control).\n\nSo, kindly tell us all which category you fall into and we'll work from there.\n\n> I also don't remember shifting the blame\n\nYour general attitude is that the only reason you are toxic in-game is because other people re toxic in-game. While you might accept responsibility for your own toxicity, that doesn't mean you're not \"shifting the blame\" to others as well. Fact is, you are claiming that your toxicity is a direct result of other players toxicity, which is a claim that would indicate the blame lies with those other players more than it lies with you. While you might not be saying it bluntly, or even be aware you are doing it, you are still shifting at least a portion of the blame to other players.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Dyl","date":"2016-04-17T22:09:31.033+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"#Tyler1 \n16 accounts and still going lmao","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Kairin","date":"2016-04-18T05:42:36.023+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"haha shame","replies":[]},{"poster":"Synct","date":"2016-04-14T03:23:30.748+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"LOL to get banned over this on OCE is hilarious.
