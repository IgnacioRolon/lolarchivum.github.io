Pentakill and Undertaker and are pretty average, Pentakill being his only good skin imo. When I was going to bed one night I had a sudden skin concept idea. CHICKEN FARMER YORICK. Hear me out:\r\n\r\nPlayer Model Yorick is in a farmer like get-up, straw hat, pitchfork and a piece of hay hanging out of his mouth. His clothes look like a ragged old farmer. Keeping his skin type the same unlike pentakill.\r\n\r\nPassive/ Last Rites Yorick&#039;s ghouls are actually baby chickens or just small chickens. The Graves are eggs in which they hatch from.\r\n\r\nDark Procession Yorick raises a chicken coop/pen from the ground shutting enemies in.\r\n\r\nMourning Mist Yorick throws a bag of chicken pellets or seeds on the ground highlighting enemies with small angry chicken symbols.\r\n\r\nEulogy of the Isles Yorick summons a giant chicken or rooster to fight for him. The Massive chook shoots pellets in a continuous stream from its mouth whenever attacks. If not this stream of pellets, maybe just refer to old maidens attack with a recolour and just have the beam shooting from its beak.\r\n\r\nHope you boys and girls like the idea! Please show your support for this skin!","replies":[{"poster":"jigglejigglwoosh","date":"2017-08-04T03:49:07.101+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"[](https://vignette3.wikia.nocookie.net/2007scape/images/f/f3/Fred_the_Farmer.png/revision/latest?cb=20151009044935)\nhere is my design for what he should look like and here are the chickens \n[](https://vignette2.wikia.nocookie.net/2007scape/images/d/d3/Unusual_Chicken.png/revision/latest?cb=20141130115720)","replies":[{"poster":"jigglejigglwoosh","date":"2017-08-04T03:49:58.779+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"https://vignette3.wikia.nocookie.net/2007scape/images/f/f3/Fred_the_Farmer.png/revision/latest?cb=20151009044935\nhttps://vignette2.wikia.nocookie.net/2007scape/images/d/d3/Unusual_Chicken.png/revision/latest?cb=20141130115720","replies":[{"poster":"xXThePunisherXx","date":"2017-08-05T10:04:16.947+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yes that is awesome!
