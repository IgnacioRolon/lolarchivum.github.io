And this is ARAM, so I'm not even picking her. That was like 4 games with Janna, 3 s grades and an a+.\nNami is also an easy support to get an s on in ARAM, others like Sona are a bit harder. Just build full AP rather than support and get your support s grades in ARAM.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Hideousbeast","date":"2016-08-30T07:10:56.717+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I think that in order to really succeed in a different role (with whatever champ you use), you have to play that role well. So for a Kat ADC, your physical damage would need to be higher than other Kat ADC's. Other things like destroying towers, inhibs and the like would also play a part in a good ranking for the ADC. If you play a Kat ADC, don't play the same as you would a mid role, because you aren't going to be as successful.\n\nLikewise if you played a Kat support, if you place a lot of wards, get a lot of assists and very few deaths you are going to perform better than if you simply go a Kat with exhaust and play a typical assassin role.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Gr1fter","date":"2016-08-30T06:19:06.539+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You have to remember that you are being compared to other Kat players on your server.\n\nThis [link](http://na.leagueoflegends.com/en/page/features/champion-mastery) goes to the Champion Mastery FAQ that has some of the finer details about getting higher ranks.\n\nYour KDA is pretty good, but CS is low and deaths are high.\n\nI've found the best way to get an S on any champ is to minimise your deaths. You want to have a good K/D ratio to get a high score. Also keep your CS up through out the game. Maybe aim for about 6-7 per minute.","replies":[]}]}
