My entire team was flaming me for picking Evelynn mid, which they were rightfully mad over. I was not paying attention in lobby and didn&#039;t realise I was mid before I locked in. They then proceeded  to harass me for the entire game - every death - every mistake. My ENTIRE team. \n\nThere are a few messages that, without context, would look very inappropriate:\n\nAquariuus: veig get dark seal\nAquariuus: and then mejais\n&amp;\nAquariuus: and even so, picking evelynn mid isn&#039;t against the rules lmao ? XD\n \nThe first couple of messages I have used were in light of the obvious difficulty I was having against Veigar. I was not inting whatsoever, simply prompting an opponent to advance themselves. \n\nThe third message looks like I was saying I chose Eve on purpose, but truthfully, context really matters. An ally was complaining about me picking Evelynn despite me clearly making a mistake, which I replied to with &quot;Even so&quot;- (me, explaining that EVEN IF I had picked Evelynn on purpose,) -&quot;picking evelynn mid isn&#039;t against the rules lmao ? XD&quot;\n\nAlso, I am not complaining or appealing in any way, I am simply asking for opinions.\n\nStill hurts tho {{item:3070}} ","replies":[{"poster":"QAPLA","date":"2018-02-02T21:14:36.427+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"Why don't you just use the mute buttons?\n\nMost of these \"banned\" posts could have been avoided by just muting other players.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Sn4ke","date":"2018-02-04T10:29:50.732+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Maybe you were spamming chat, harrassing and cussing.
