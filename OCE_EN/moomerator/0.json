In my last game I noticed multiple occasions when the blind set in faster than expected and made early trading significantly easier. Maybe I could be imagining things but I was just curious to know if any of you veteran mo players out there have noticed the same thing (I didnt see it in the patch notes but figured they mightve just taken care of it during the update).","replies":[{"poster":"Project Xayah","date":"2015-08-12T05:23:44.190+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"As far as I'm aware the most recent change to blinds (whether specific to Teemo or not) was in 5.7, where the \"miss\" window changed from on-attack declaration to on-attack launch. Perhaps this is what you are referring to?","replies":[]},{"poster":"Grok","date":"2015-08-10T16:28:29.230+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Haven't noticed the blind thing, but I am sure pissed off about the shroom nerf. I mean come on riot, its kinda all he's got late game because every other champ takes him out with 2 hits kinda, and if they use oracles and lens alot, then he is not much good at all. They should  lower the CD and increase the number of shrooms he can carry to compensate, definite nerf Teemo didn't deserve. I hate to say this, but after many years of playing teemo regularly, i thinking of quitting him because just cant do shit now.
