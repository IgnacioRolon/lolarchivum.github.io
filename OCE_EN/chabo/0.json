My patcher hasn't worked for the past 2 months","subforum":"Help & Support (OCE)","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"For the past two months when ever i open the league patcher it, the &quot;Launch&quot; button is there, but no matter how many times i&#039;ve clicked on it nothing happens. Even when a new patch rolled out it was still there, i didnt download any files or anything. But no matter how much times i click on it , nothing happens. I&#039;ve tried uninstalling and reinstalling but once the patcher opens it still says &quot;Launch&quot; and clicking on that button doesnt nothing. I can&#039;t swap regions or repair the patcher because i can never click on it. I&#039;ve left my patcher on for over 9 hours and nothing happens. Help please i really want to play in the preseason!","replies":[{"poster":"Wuks","date":"2015-11-19T10:28:02.799+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey Astin,\n\nCan you try running the lol.launcher.admin.exe file in your League of Legends folder?
