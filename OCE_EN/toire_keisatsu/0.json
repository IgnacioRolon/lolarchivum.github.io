I have not often been able to get away because of his passive, and that is what I will talk about here. His passive is way too op, giving him way too much opportunities in game and in the jungle. So I will propose an idea as to a way of balancing this out. It&#039;s quite simple really. It is to add a cooldown to the passive. eg: Rengar can leap to a nearby enemy unit while inside brush once every 10 seconds.\n\nIf rengar is, APPARENTLY, already balanced please let me know. (Highly unlikely to be honest)\n\nI really hope you take this into consideration, this has given me a lot of trouble and I know a lot of champions are op/broken but Rengar has been for a long time, so I believe he should be next in the line :)","replies":[{"poster":"GigaPube","date":"2016-04-17T00:13:55.773+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"you've lost duels or entire games to rengar frequently as lee? if you cant outplay a 6.7 rengar as lee sin you deserve to lose and you have no say in what should happen to either or any other champions","replies":[{"poster":"Fitzky","date":"2016-04-17T06:12:06.569+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Amen this post is just stupid no one shall ever touch my rengar","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Fitzky","date":"2016-04-16T13:37:33.657+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"NO NO NO NO NO NO NO NO NO YOU WONT DO ANYTHING TO MY RENGAR","replies":[]}]}
