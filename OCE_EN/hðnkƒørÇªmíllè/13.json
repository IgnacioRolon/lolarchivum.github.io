Throughout the lane phase, the attempting to reconnect logo pops up, even though I&#039;m on 40 ping, can move and use abilities fine, net still working. I hit 6, use my ult, then instantly drop from the game. I currently am unable to reconnect, getting the firewall message (which is Bullsh*t). What is going on?\n\nEDIT: After hitting reconnect a billion times it finally gave me a different message. The game you are trying to connect to has ended, hit ok to continue to the homepage. I didn't lose any LP, no match history or recently played with or anything recorded of that game existing. The game was only like 10 minutes in as well, before surrender time.","replies":[{"poster":"Urgot Bot","date":"2015-04-11T14:36:06.836+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"That wasn't a Sion bug, the OCE servers had maintenance and this is a result of that.","replies":[]},{"poster":"hðnkƒørÇªmíllè","date":"2015-04-11T09:45:22.265+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Went to replay, as soon as is starts says game ended with no result.","replies":[]},{"poster":"greatdeathz","date":"2015-04-11T09:29:34.180+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"if it wasnt recorded then maybe its just all in your head :^)","replies":[]}]}
