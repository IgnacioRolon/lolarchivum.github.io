I've been waiting for something of the likes to this for a while now, a reward for playing a champion often and being good at said champion, so yeah :P\r\nBut I have one thing that I have to say for it, is that hopefully it actually rewards people for 'mastering champions.' What I exactly mean by this, is that if/when I see someone with a tier 5 or higher badge on a certain champion, I should feel like \"Woah this guy knows what he is doing; he is a seasoned professional\" and not \"Oh this guy just spammed X champion for a week straight.\" It shouldn't really be something you grind for in a short amount of time. A living example of someone who might have a tier 5/higher would be S Diana 2 on the NA server. he has 1 golden champion that he plays, essentially being a 'master' of that champion, furthermore deserving a higher tier for that champion. NA player Catsexual would also be viable for a higher tier reward for his Nidalee and possibly even Gosu for his/her :^) Vayne. But say someone like Bjergsen. He is exceptionally good with LeBlanc and Zed for example and would still be deserving of a high tier banner, but not the highest per say, since he doesn't always play said champion, but is still very good at them. These are just examples that come to mind :3\r\n\r\nTl;dr champion mastery system shouldn't be a grind but instead an acknowledgment per say of actually mastering and being good at a certain champion.

It just doesn't make good business sense to make your playerbase feel inadequate. There is already a ranked system in place to judge skill and that's epeen enough isn't it?\n\nI mean, i'm fairly new and not sure how Riot implements things in general, so I could be wrong. But I think it will be \"this person has played/won X games with champion\" Maybe with some other type of criteria for further mastery bonuses like \"obtained Pentakill\" or \"obtained Pentakill X times\".\nI've entered plenty of ranked games where someone has a gold badge on their splash and they play like bronze, only for them to go \"lol first time X\". I would assume that this system will... \"remedy\" that misconception and make it more clear when someone enters a game whether they're experienced with that champion or not.\n\nI haven't kept up with every bit of information on this mastery thing, but that's the basic gist I got from the original post pertaining to it as well.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Sackboy","date":"2015-03-17T12:25:02.283+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It's like Riot ripped what SMITE had and tried to make it pretty.
