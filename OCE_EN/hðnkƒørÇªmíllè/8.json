I have played this game for 3+ years but this is where it comes to a diminishing end.              \r\nWith the ~~removal~~ &quot;postponement&quot; of solo q I consider this the final straw in my pathway of League. With each coming day this game becomes less and less enjoyable and my faith in Rito is declining on a parallel scope. I came to this realisation that even playing games in URF mode brought about some of the most dull and boring games of my life.           \r\n                  \r\nLets talk what some of these &#039;straws&#039; were...\r\n\r\n* First they retcon&#039;d the shit out of the lore, making it a cesspit of loopholes and nonsense. The lore of this game is what had me very intrigued as a new player and with the god awful corruption of it, I felt a chunk of this game die in my heart.                    \r\n                         \r\n* Next came the execution of the beloved forums, and the installation of these abominable boards. Forums were a whole separate community from league, for me especially. I made _**real life**_ connections with the wonderful people of OCE General Discussion, which has had the life sucked out of it almost entirely. Once upon a time I checked Forums daily and played 5 mans with the people I met on it often. I even went to PCBangs with some GD&#039;ers and got to know some pretty cool people as a result, people who I rarely or never even speak to or play with nowadays.  What a pity                \r\n\r\n* Then they removed graves cigar which was just ludicrous and unnecessary.              \r\n\r\nBut even after all these atrocities, I still kept soldiering on. I kept playing league and climbed all the way from bronze 1 to platinum 5 in the course of season 5 in Solo Q...             \r\n           \r\nWhich brings me to my next and final point. This is where I finally draw the line after all these years, all these memories. THIS is where it grinds to a halt. With no soloq I feel there is no purpose in playing this game for any moment longer. I have over 3000+ normal games played of league of legends, with nearly 2000 wins. I feel as if I can reliably say I have played and experienced all this game has to offer on a game play level. my option then would be to enter the competitive aspect of the game, but low and behold, the terror of Dynamic queue and disappearance of Soloq. DQ does not provide an accurate reading of an individual players skill level. I&#039;m tired of 5 man premades crushing solo players. There is no point in climbing any further. What is the point of getting diamond or higher as a solo player when the possibility of me just grabbing 4 other buddies on comms and smashing it all the way up there.          \r\n                  \r\nLeague of Legends is no longer the same game that I fell in love with so long ago, or run by the same people I looked up to for so long. And with all that, I announce my departure from this game. Thank you to everyone in the oceanic league community that has been a part of this journey and evolved it into more than just a hobby and entertainment hub, but something much more grand. it has been a pleasure to serve on the Rift with you all.          \r\n    \r\nUntil we meet again.             \r\n{{champion:64}} Musterpulse :^) {{champion:64}} \r\n\r\n{{sticker:slayer-jinx-catface}}","replies":[]}
