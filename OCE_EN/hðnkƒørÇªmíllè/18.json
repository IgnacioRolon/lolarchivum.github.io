The sun, shimmering brightly over the mountain peaks, breaching on the sunset; a final sunset. Champions gathered from lands abound, in the great hall of the Institute of War, or more commonly referred to as, the League of Legends. The fiercest of summoners sat with them, conversing, laughing, reminiscing in memories of countless hours spent grinding together on the fields of justice. It was all doomed, for when the sun set, everything would be re-written. They were relishing every last second of that marvellous day. Every last second summoners could call themselves summoners, Champions retained their backstory, and the Institute and the fields of justice were as real as the stones beneath their feet. All destined to be extinguished come nightfall. \r\n\r\nSome sat around and drank themselves silly. Gragas and Jax could be seen at a large table, dozens of empty glasses stacked in piles beside them, full pints in their hands as they smashed &#039;em down their gullets. First to drop to the floor loses! Many can be seen chatting, some very cheerful, telling tales of their vast and enthralling encounters both in and outside of the fields of justice. All the high caliber co-ordination and insane high risk manoeuvres each had pulled off. The years they had spent as summoners, learning the mechanics of their champions. All those years to be forgotten in the history books at dusk. Finally, a small group of summoners decided to, before it all disappeared, battle each other on the fields of justice. The sun was due to set within the hour, so they decided to queue for one last game while they could still rightfully call themselves a summoner for the League of Legends. What had been forged in stone in the centre of Runeterra to resolve conflict throughout the lands, and prevent any further devastation with the likes of the rune wars, was fated to be decommissioned, and removed from the lore altogether.\r\n\r\n10 summoners stepped into the small summoning room. This would be the final game of the day. The doors were sealed behind them. A last clash on the fields of justice. The last clash with champions that have their simple yet effective backstories, free of loopholes and un-synchronized plot lines. Before they stand up to their summoning portals, they shake each others hands. friend or foe, it mattered not, for the conflict would be settled with a classic 5 vs 5 on the summoners rift. Some had tears in their eyes, and rolling off and down their cheeks. Others trying their best to hold back the pain. The pain of what is to become canon, and the almighty fear of impending doom. The almighty fear of a retcon. They would plunge onto the fields of justice with a champion of choice as a summoner, but they would not emerge the same as they were before. No one would. Everyone and everything they had come to know and understand about their world was under potential threat. With some final words leaving the mouths of the summoners, they stand up to their respective summoning portals. the last spectrum of light seeping its way in through the great glass windows surrounding them. In front of them, the summoning portals each displayed one word embedded on a large red panel. They each put their hands around the holographic spheres, selecting the bright red panel together in perfect harmony. \r\n\r\n&quot;Play&quot;\r\n\r\nWritten and Posted by RNG Worlds S6, formerly known as Musterpulse.","replies":[]}
