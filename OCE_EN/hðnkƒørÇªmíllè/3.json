I assume it is just taking some time to process like some of the earn-able icons do in events, but I still haven't got it a few hours later :\\ I checked the lunar revel event promo page, and it said mystery chests for lunar revel and fancy pants mystery chest get it. I hope normal mystery chests still get it :^o\n\nI'm a bit of summoner icon sl~t so I am really keen to get this, but I can wait if I know it is at least on its way.\n\nEdit: Just gave someone one of the fancy mystery gifts, so I am certain I am in the green now :) the wait begins","replies":[{"poster":"Phoenix Dancer","date":"2015-02-18T08:51:59.813+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/204009184-Lunar-Revel-2015-Guide#h4\n\nThis is a description of the qualifying gifts. Scroll down to find the article relating to the icons. Click on the red hyperlink for more information.\nHope this helps some of you who are wondering what will happen with the icon. I for one remember that the icons from last year took up to a week to be dispatched. Sometimes they are not dispatched until the event ends.\nHappy waiting game :)","replies":[{"poster":"hðnkƒørÇªmíllè","date":"2015-02-18T09:06:51.991+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Cheers bud, I know that some event icons can take a damn while to be doled out sometimes, particularly if they are merchandise (Buy stuff with RP) related ones too. I will enjoy the wait for it to arrive :P","replies":[{"poster":"Phoenix Dancer","date":"2015-02-19T10:35:24.316+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"No worries :)\nRiot succeeded this year in causing a great deal of confusion regarding the qualifying gifts. Namely with their reference to \"Lunar revel mystery gift\", which gives the clear impression that there is a specific lunar box in the gifting page. Psh. What they mean is that the box 975 value has higher chance at containing a lunar skin. lol. Thanks Riot ^^ \nIt's certainly disappointing though to know that some people are receiving theirs almost instantly. I don't usually get emotional,\nbut in this instance {{item:3070}} \nHope we are not waiting *too* long, otherwise it will soon become grumpy waiting and not happy waiting.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Thredson","date":"2015-02-12T11:46:37.590+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Curious about this also, is the \"Lunar Revel Mystery Box\" something still to come or is it just the normal mystery gift?","replies":[]},{"poster":"hðnkƒørÇªmíllè","date":"2015-02-12T12:17:04.751+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"#Bigsad if normal mystery gifts don't get it :\\","replies":[]}]}
