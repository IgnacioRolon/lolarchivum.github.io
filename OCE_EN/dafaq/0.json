During champ select last order pick wanted mid so we let him play and he goes yi mid. After he gave FB and he got pissed because we asked him to play safe and just like a troll he was like how dare you say that now I feed and he started feeding.\r\n\r\nThe rest 4 including me in my team were upset but we ignored him and we 4 played vs the 5 on the enemy team. Results are in the link below.\r\n\r\nJust ignore the person in your team who is feeding and report it to riot later on, Just farm up and coordinate with the rest as a team and you can easily win the game.\r\n\r\nhttp://www.megafileupload.com/5mzf/LOL_OPGG_Observer_108926799_replay.cmd\r\n\r\nHe was very bad, Made us upset but at the end 4 v 5 we won.","replies":[{"poster":"TeCoolMage","date":"2015-10-24T01:36:19.548+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It's not easy unless the other team is bad...... Otherwise the meta in 5 teams would be \"Okay, one person plays as a troll so we can ignore him, then we coordinate and our chances of winning will skyrocket!!!\"","replies":[{"poster":"dafaq","date":"2015-10-24T03:21:33.426+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"They were not bad, but we just played calmly and farmed plus picked them 1 by 1 lol.
