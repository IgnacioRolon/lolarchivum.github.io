I can also play any other roles except for support pretty decently as well. I&#039;ve been to silver 5 before but I&#039;ve been having bad luck with my ranked matched so I stopped playing for a while after I get demoted to B3. I&#039;m not very salty usually and I don&#039;t flame people. I don&#039;t get easily tilted too so if you&#039;re interested hit me up.\r\n\r\nIGN: Salyer","replies":[{"poster":"A Spikey Pickle","date":"2016-06-08T08:45:14.400+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'd love to play too. bronze 3 and recently demoted from bronze 2. i main mid and top, can play jg without feeding, can play supp without feeding BUT cant play ADC properly.
