So I have experienced a mute for a inappropriate comment made weeks ago and since then I have made absolutely sure that nothing like that was said again. Thankfully I was put with someone who wanted to int kills, take my lane, whilst afking in between. Thought if he&#039;s breaking multiple rules at once, calling him out on it shouldn&#039;t put me in the wrong, especially if I do it calm and collectively, wrong again. Turns out it only took me two games of being put with this guy and calling him out on it to experience yet another mute, 24 game this time. Now I feel like there&#039;s literally next to no reason to even bother posting on here to expect results, it&#039;s clear what Riot Games are about, letting repeat offenders get away with anything they want and beating on the victims of these offenders. Now I know calling him out wasn&#039;t a good idea but hey! Neither is consistently queuing up with the intent of ruining the game for 9 other players. I am quite curious as to what I said that would justify a mute, empty, PG rated words that somehow weren&#039;t approved by Riot.","replies":[{"poster":"Tele","date":"2017-04-13T08:00:35.183+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The system doesn't punish people for swearing, it punishes people for insulting others or being offensive. \n\nThere's a big difference, to us and the Instant Feedback system, between; _\"fuck me... sorry blitz\"_, and _\"fuck you blitz\"_. The first phrase won't get you banned by the system ever, whereas the second phrase will, because you're insulting others.

Or you can post your chat logs here for the community to critique you a bit.","replies":[]}]}
