He's a great kiter with Rylais, and has awesome sustain with will of the ancients.\n\nHe's probably going to be updated a bit mid year, check out this post to see our champion designers thoughts on the champion - http://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/developer-corner/OJQBsbEM-mid-year-mage-updates-vladimir-direction","replies":[]},{"poster":"Shes my Princess","date":"2016-03-06T15:27:32.738+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Vlad is an amazing low elo champion due to his high lane sustain, in built gank protection through sanguine pool, aoe waveclear/point and click low cd farming, good trading potential and fantastic late game scaling.

Assuming you mean Vlad top lane, there are a lot of high elo priority picks for top lane which simply perform better as a champion than he does; fiora and gangplank are two that come to mind that not only have high kill potential in lane but can split push better and are debateably more valuable to a team.\n\nBut in lower elo go right ahead fam, he's great to rise a few ranks!","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Essembie","date":"2016-03-06T08:05:29.379+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I've not seen a good vlad in a while.\n\nBack in S3 and 4 if I remember correctly he had a lot of play but not a lot in my ELO.","replies":[]}]}
