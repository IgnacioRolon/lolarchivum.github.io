People are saying that kindred is too strong, that she's OP etc but let's be honest the word OP is overused. I think she will get a small nerf yes, but not a huge one, as people learn to play against her she won't be nearly as strong. That said she will still be strong in blind pick because her strongest counters are specifically knockbacks (to knock her out of her W) which are harder to come by than most types of cc.\n\nWith that said, my personal pick would be Kindred, but I never enjoyed the tank playstyle much. Tahm is very strong, his scaling health damage post 6 is huge and he has great cc and peel potential. his pitfall is in the reliability of that cc. If you're versing a kite-y or cc heavy team you'll have a hard time getting the three stacks to stun or devour.\n\nBoth Kindred and Tahm are very versatile champs so their both solid picks. I personally prefer Kindred's mobility though. It's very responsive, she one of those champions that's VERY satisfying to play well and is easy to play but challenging to play well (my favourite kind of champ). \n\nTahm can play top/jng/supp and Kindred can play jng/adc so they're both multi role champs...that's all I got. Enjoy whoever you end up picking!","replies":[]},{"poster":"Jink","date":"2015-10-16T18:20:16.024+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I think Kindred is really fun - Cruising through the Jungle her play seems really smooth and she feels really responsive to play.\n\nBut Tahm Kench can be really rewarding to play so I honestly think he's a bigger game changer than Kindred will ever be but I play a lot of Marksmen so to me having one in the Jungle was a big plus :P","replies":[]},{"poster":"Saythes","date":"2015-10-16T16:25:23.651+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Personally, I've only played kindred once, which was on OFA...
