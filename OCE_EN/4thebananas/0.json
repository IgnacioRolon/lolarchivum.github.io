Zac&#039;s skins look like they are  just colored differently, i know that they have some changes but if you look at his skins you&#039;ll most likely  think that they are really similar. You should make this skin Cloud Zac because it has features that really pop out. Like how the pieces of clouds create a trail to Zac&#039;s head, or how he has a blue circle in the middle of his chest that looks like a portal. Riot I know that this skin is going to be hard to make because of Zac&#039;s abilities, but Cloud Zac would make a lot of Zac mains happy.","replies":[{"poster":"The Mark Show","date":"2016-08-07T19:43:43.127+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"make it yourself, they got tons of skins at leaguecraft.com that would have stuff like this =)","replies":[]},{"poster":"Drakuns","date":"2016-07-19T07:17:20.567+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I still think zac would be good made up of yordals{{sticker:slayer-pantheon-thumbs}}","replies":[]}]}
