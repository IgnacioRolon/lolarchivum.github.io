I can only assume that it's an issue related to the upcoming reset or to do with people who got bumped up from Div 5 to Div 4.~~\n\n~~Player support might be able to provide you with more information: https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/requests/new~~\n\n~~I wouldn't be too worried unless S9 rolls around and it's still displaying incorrectly.~~\n\nUPDATE: Seems to be affecting anyone who got bumped up from Div 4 to 5 (with that increased rank being their highest) and confirmed started this patch. I've passed it on and we did some digging to confirm conditions so hopefully we'll hear something/it'll be fixed up soon.","replies":[]},{"poster":"ObamaGotSwag","date":"2019-01-11T02:10:22.047+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I have the same problem too, recently I've had the plat border but now it is showing my flex border which is silver when loading into a game","replies":[]},{"poster":"Js tea","date":"2019-01-09T12:05:39.115+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Same problem here!","replies":[]},{"poster":"V Thy","date":"2019-01-09T02:20:01.330+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You're not alone, I finished last season in Gold V and with the new patch I have no border at all.
