Everyone from scripters to people that purchased bot accounts will be banned although it may take longer than usual. \nThe most likely reason for this is because 3rd part bans are pretty serious (instant perma) and Riot wants to make extra sure that they aren't banning innocent people.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Neosinf","date":"2017-01-12T10:02:32.322+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"The answer lies within your comment my friend.\n\nPeople who script are contributing their time and talent to making the game more of a challenge for you. Should we not applaud them?\n\nPeople who spam EZ are just showing that the game is not challenging enough. We don't need this kind of complacency and disrespect from those that don't contribute!

I believe everyone deserves a chance even scripters. Not that I condone that sort of thing whatsoever, but in reality scripters are bringing you less grief than those who abuse you, and call out EZ at the end of the game. They actually want to win, yeah they are cheating, yeah they should be punished... but permanently banning someone for that? How about a no end of year rewards etc.? Hell Bill Gates cheated his whole empire... Just a thought.\n\nOn a quick side note though, I think that \"botters\", those who are using scripts purely to to level and gain IP should be permanently banned. That's just money making bullcrap.","replies":[]}]}]}
