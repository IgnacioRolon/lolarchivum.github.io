The possibilities for bot lane have opened up now that players are looking at bot lane differently, with fresh eyes._\n\n\n\n\n_**Now onto the discussion points:**_\n\n**Has Mordes new kit been accepted by the playerbase as an acceptable duo laner?\n**\n Personally I think yes, when Morde has been picked I haven&#039;t seen a single complaint. We all know where his rework has placed him and understand that as a community so just go along with it, this is great for allowing other \"unorthodox\" picks into the bot lane as well as opening up different strategies. Though Mordes Dragonforce is a \"little\" overtuned and has lead to banning of the champ, I think that so far his shifting to bot lane has been healthy for the game overall.\n\n_ What are your thoughts on this? Personally I think I&#039;m going to start playing Yorick bot lane now after destroying a few games on it in Silver/Gold and will definitely pick-up the new Morde too.\n_\n\n\n**Will ADCs have to shift lanes now rather than facing a somewhat oppressive and high sustain/harass matchup?**\n This is a small concern and my best guess is that the meta will either shift to high sustain supports + wave clear ADCs to face-off against these lanes or we will see a shift towards beefier and more aggressive frontline duo-lanes with some sustain. The alternative however is that we start seeing ADCs played in other lanes more often, we&#039;ve already spent this pro season with Varus/Ez/Corki being played mid as AD and their is no reason that most others cannot play here just as safely.\n\n_ This is probably one of the smaller impacts to the meta as we understand it but it does mean that teams could start favoring AP tops/Jungles as a way of getting a more balanced damage output across their team. Has anyone had a Morde Team-mate and decided to play a ranged ADC in another lane to compensate?_\n\n\n\n**Lastly, how have you faired facing these lanes with a traditional bot-lane duo?**\n Possibly the most important question is will the playerbase be ok facing this for now until any possible shift takes place? I&#039;ve personally been unable to lane against a Morde in solo queue as a support player with a random ADC, he does tend to push lanes making himself and his partner vulnerable to ganks which can be abused, but for now I&#039;m more concerned with how the matchups playout head-to-head.\n\n_ With morde currently being almost perma-banned it may take a while for us to reach any reasonable consensus on the matter but for now, I&#039;m gonna continue playing broken bot lane combos because it&#039;s fun and feels new, anything that can make a game as old as LOL feel fresh and new can&#039;t be too bad right?_\n\n\n\n**TL;DR has Morde bot lane changed to game for better or worse and how have you gone facing/playing with/as/against Morde duos?**","replies":[{"poster":"Your Neighbour","date":"2015-08-29T05:56:34.117+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Easy free win vs Morde duo\n\nHe can't even farm pre 6, you only die if you have a reta...
