This was not intentional and that's why there was no communication on the removal of that limitation. We now fixed the problem and the ranked cut off is in place.\n\n> (from reddit)\n> Let me explain a little how the matchmaking works and how this affect our decision to open / close queues. (Big Disclaimer: I'm not from the team who manage the queues so I'm replying to the best of my non-technical knowledge) Matchmaking tried to match you in the shortest possible time with players with similar level of skill. So the 2 important factors for matchmaking are time and quality. In order to do that, there is a certain amount of players which need to be online otherwise our matchmaking will compromise time first and quality after meaning that during night time you may initially wait for many minutes and then, our matchmaking will try to broad the research and match you with either stronger or weaker opponents. While this is \"okish\" for normals, when it is about rank, we want to maintain fairness therefore when these conditions are not satisfy, we prefer to remove the queue. This is what it happening in the middle of the night in Oceania.\n> \n \nNow, you are telling us that the quality was not a big problem when you played in the last weeks so we are going to look at the data from last week and see if you are right. Our assumption is that matchmaking \"might\" be ok for silver-gold-plat but really doesn't work at the extremes (bronze and diamond-challenger).\nIf, after looking at the data we see this is not the case, we may revisit the decision to open the ranked queues during that period.\n\nMM","replies":[{"poster":"BadMrFrostie","date":"2015-08-18T03:32:54.893+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thanks a lot for the reply here, Oce related news will never get upvoted on reddit unless it's something big :3\n\n Really hope that the queues to end up getting opened up, I was surprised to meet a number of cool people on at those hours.","replies":[{"poster":"Your Neighbour","date":"2015-08-18T06:43:25.645+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"We had massive response of 6 comments in that reddit!","replies":[{"poster":"DarkTetris","date":"2015-08-18T16:29:08.630+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"A lot of the people who play late at night are from overseas and don't speak english.

Thanks for the reply.\n\nI played 4am-8am ranked solo queue and it was fine. And this was *without* people knowing the queue was open. The queue times were maybe a minute slower but I would much rather wait a little longer than not play ranked at all.\n\nI am not able to play during the normal hours of the day so 10pm-6am is the best time for me to play. When you speak to everyone please pass that we would like it running as long as possible! \n\nAlso my friends in Thailand would like to play longer but can't due to the early cut off period. Some people only like playing ranked so you maybe losing a lot of players in Asia due to the closing.\n\nThanks again :)","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"vicelore","date":"2015-08-18T03:55:42.184+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Just put the ques up, If it sucks people just wont play like they do for TB.. \n\nOverall it would be a positive thing.","replies":[]},{"poster":"She Loves Me","date":"2015-08-19T20:45:56.193+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I am a diamond 5, was diamond 4 (3 days ago). I didn't have a problem finding matches during the times of 4am-8am and the matches that were found were relatively even. We have more people Q.Qing about team builder existing than what we have Q.Qing about unfair matches in ranked. \n\nPeople complain about unfair games at all ranks at all times of the day because they believe they are better than where they are placed, or stuck and can't climb. I don't see where this is a problem either. A player who versus a better player initially becomes a better player themselves, and a player who versus a bad opponent and may get lucky with games and climb wont stay at the high rank he has accomplished by doing so. The logic the Riot staff give is flawed. You don't want to have Ranked Queues running overnight because it costs money, money is #1. \n\nRito pls. A lot of Australian doll bludgers who are nocturnal really want ranked queues up, we spend a lot of money on skins because we live in our mother's basements free of charge. Rito pls.
