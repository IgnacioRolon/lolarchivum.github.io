I also found games were less likely to have dodgers at that hour but whether that was co-incidence or everyone wanting to make the most of it is up for debate.","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Olee","date":"2015-08-27T20:34:19.421+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"pls rito","replies":[]},{"poster":"Realm","date":"2015-08-27T13:17:03.088+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"There is more than likely no chance of that ever happening.\nThe times of which ranked is disabled is when the server is most inactive.
