Wish Riot would make press releases about stuff like this if it&#039;s been them seeking out these accounts for perma-bans, it&#039;s the kind of thing I think the community should know about.","replies":[{"poster":"Yasei Doubutsu","date":"2015-09-04T13:10:27.166+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Ive sent like 3 tickets with essays containing Bot ID's.

I reported every bot i met in Ai games and maybe riot noticed them and banned them from the game or maybe the botter's Ai became a little smarter and we got fooled by it. I remember a few of them that i reported in the past. I checked their id on op.gg and i found them but data on the games they played won't refresh which could mean they have been banned. Not sure if riot did ban the botters but if they did that's great and i hope they continue banning cheaters.","replies":[{"poster":"BadMrFrostie","date":"2015-09-04T13:23:06.303+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The thing is not only is it cleaning up game modes like co-op vs ai from dealing with this shit, but these accounts are likely being sold to players to use as smurfs, etc to ruin low elo games as well so it's kind of 2 birds one stone.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"GigaPube","date":"2015-09-04T20:03:35.492+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"no i havent noticed, they're still in every like 3rd bot game","replies":[{"poster":"BadMrFrostie","date":"2015-09-05T09:53:13.098+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"damn I haven't seen one in several games now...","replies":[]}]}]}
