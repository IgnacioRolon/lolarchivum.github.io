Actually blame is not the right word, the right word is he thinks he is the best, he can die, misplay but no body else can.\r\n\r\nno appreciation for anything team did, just wanted to tilt others with his duo.\r\n\r\nI am just very annoyed, I actually dont want to play support anymore, why play support when your adc is so toxic???\r\n\r\nincentive to play support is just never there i guess\r\n\r\nI reported them, but who knows what will happen, i probably never going to find out... but i am just annoyed.","replies":[{"poster":"JasonWazza","date":"2017-10-27T01:10:47.099+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Honestly, i play a lot of support, and very rarely is that not the ADC's attitude unless it happens to be someone i play with regularly.\n\nYou just get used to the fact that a lot of the ADC's are a bit less... with it then most others.\n\nIf you find the role fun, keep playing it, and consider muting the ADC if they act like it again.","replies":[]},{"poster":"DarkShade918","date":"2017-10-27T01:21:23.759+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"I just troll my adc, purposefully miss hooks, throw the most fed team member at my adc, then help the rest of the team win a 4v5, and if in doubt, rage harder, trust me, it works 100% of the time, you get banned then you don't have to play with toxic players :^)","replies":[]},{"poster":"Matsuzaka544","date":"2017-10-26T20:46:51.659+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"You know what's better than you winning?
