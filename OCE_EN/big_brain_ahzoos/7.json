BUT even as mini Gnar, you always have Mega Gnar’s attack range.\n\nAlso if the person you turn into has a fully stacked rageblade at the time, you can have your W passive proc on every second auto attack. \n\nNeeko turned into Ahri sometimes doesn’t have hold her ball.\n\nEtc etc.\n\n__________\n\nNeeko’s passive is too half-hearted IMO. It has too many give-aways that make it obvious that you’re not the actual champ.\n\nBasic attack range for one, you can’t exceed your own attack range even if you’ve copied someone with greater range.  Which makes being Trist/Cait etc very obvious lies.  Champs with permanent particle effects tied to abilities (like Taric’s shoulder crystal) also make for very un-convincing fakes.  Not to mention on hit effects like Vayne’s silver bolts not showing up.\n\nIf you’re going to make Neeko’s disguise break on any champion damage, then her disguise should be convincing.\n\nIf her disguise isn’t convincing, then it should have more durability (e.g. being broken only by spells that prevent casting)\n\nThat’s my opinion at least.","replies":[{"poster":"JasonWazza","date":"2019-10-14T06:38:33.656+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/532516655968944128/629341403922825217/unknown.png\n\nThen there is shit like this, where it's not possible to not know who neeko is.\n\nBut riot doesn't really seem to care enough to bother fixing it in a shorter time frame then when we can be fucked.","replies":[{"poster":"Lord Sesshomaru","date":"2019-10-14T14:17:21.651+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I play Neeko a fair bit.\nAnd even still, other than a second or two of confusion, I can't seem to find any other use for her passive.\n\nIn almost every situation, one of two things happen:\n1. They hit you with something before you get close, and the jig is up. _(because it doesn't matter if you're Neeko or Rammus, they're still going to throw something at you.)_\n2. You are forced into using an ability prematurely because otherwise you'll lose the element of surprise.\n\nPersonally, I think the disguise should be more durable, only being broken by your spell-casts and CC that would prevent casting _(Stun/Knockup/Silence etc)._  That way you can get up close and personal before unleashing your spells.  That would make the enemy have to watch your behaviour closely to figure out if the Yuumi strolling up to your ADC is actually as harmless as she looks. _(rather than Ashe just spraying the field and Neeko's disguise being worthless)_","replies":[{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2019-10-14T14:25:58.975+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Consider her power without her passive though. It's a unique mechanic, that has powerful but *niche* uses. If you make the passive stronger, then you have to make her kit weaker to make her more reliant on setup, which sounds great in theory, but even a small shift would put her skill *floor* extremely high. \n\nHer skill ceiling is already pretty high for a reasonably straight-forward (passive aside) champion, and there's plenty of separation between an average Neeko and a good Neeko. Her passive isn't meant to be something you're using all the time, because if you are, then they're expecting it. You can use it to make them react to a threat that isn't there, or lure them into a false sense of security, and it has deep nuance.\n\nPersonally, I play her in support, and you can wreak absolute havoc on their jungler tracking when you're doing a ward run. You can make them react to the jungler in the lane bush when really the jungler is coming out of their tri. You can make them think the jungler is at dragon and draw theirs down while yours is happily taking Herald. It's glorious and already much more powerful than people give it credit for, because it often isn't (and shouldn't be) having a *direct* impact.\n\nI do have my gripes with the bugs though. The fact that if there's a Kayn in your game you literally can't use his body (and did you notice most of my uses centre on the jungle?) for half the game is exceedingly annoying.","replies":[{"poster":"Lord Sesshomaru","date":"2019-10-15T13:13:07.531+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yeah I get where you're coming from.\nI'm not saying it's useless, far from it!\n\nBut what I am trying to say that for such a unique mechanic, _(literally the 1 thing that sets her apart from everyone else)_ why ISN'T it having a \"_Direct Impact_\"?\n\nIt's such a special mechanic, _(no other champ has it, or likely will have anything like it in the future)_ so why haven't Riot made it the core mechanic of her gameplay?  Instead she's just a usual burst mage, but with a nifty trick.\n\nI'd have abused its uniqueness, and made her function completely around it, _(perhaps even turning into enemies under certain circumstances?)_, to the point where the enemy team has to actually stop and take stock before fights.  But that's just me, i'm not afraid of high skillcap or skillfloor champions.   Theres enough basic _\"Who Baddie? Me Smash!\"_ champs out there, why not add in some freakishly difficult ones for people to challenge themselves with?\n\nWhat would be your thoughts on that?\n\nI'll point out though, that a lot of your uses revolve around support positioning, while of course she can be played very effectively support, ultimately it isn't her primary role. And missing mids tend to go less un-noticed than missing supports most of the time,  so it narrows a mid lane Neeko's ability do pull off the plays you mentioned.  Not saying she can't, but it narrows her window to do so.  And certainly in a solo lane, it's hard to feign a gank on your own lane, when you're not there.\nBut i'm a mid laner, so I think more like a Mid than a Supp though ill admit..\n____________\n\nYeah the bugs are so annoying.\nI've had that Kayn problem too, and Kayle being melee. Solar/Lunar eclipse Leona's alternate form doesn't translate either, the list goes on.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Big Brain Ahzoos","date":"2019-10-14T15:16:51.576+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"yea like i get neeko has alot of bugs but the one i encountered is just unfair. like when i versed it i fought her thinking i was level 2 and she was level 1 and she used 2 abilities. Plus if you dont know how much health she has how are you suppose to know if you can kill her. IMO this is game breaking and should be disabled until this is fixed","replies":[]}]}
