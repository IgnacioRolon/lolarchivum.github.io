The work and conception that goes into Ultimate skins is massive, and no-one wants to get the rushed ultimate skin for their favourite champion. Since the quality and depth of Ultimate skins went up, Riot basically said \"we're going to take the time to do these right, instead of getting as many out as possible.\"\n\nWe are getting epic and legendary skins at a much higher frequency (and for the most part quality) than we used to now as well, so really it's wins all around. As cool as ultimate skins are, personally I'd rather the time is spent to make them truly awesome.","replies":[]}]}
