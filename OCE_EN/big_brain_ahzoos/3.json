I assumed the fact you kept the borders forever would be a given and most people would use their common sense to work that one out.","replies":[{"poster":"Big Brain Ahzoos","date":"2015-09-09T07:33:41.997+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":2,"body":"y do u take time out of ur life to harass people cause they just dont care about making everything they say make sense. most of the time if it doesnt make sense u still know what they are saying. so plz can u be considerate of others before typing of the internet","replies":[{"poster":"Olee","date":"2015-09-09T07:54:43.470+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"jfc","replies":[]},{"poster":"CryptozoicMan","date":"2015-09-09T15:19:24.992+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"Ok now I would like to ask where did I harass anyone for anything??I actually took time out of my life to help. I answered your question. Well I answered your question to the best of my ability as I obviously didn't understand your question completely, due to the lack of basic grammar and spelling. I was not harassing you nor making fun of you in anyway shape or form. Merely stating why I answered the question the way I did. Now I ask you seeing as you paint me with that paint brush. If you ever feel the need to reply to me correct your spelling. It literally hurt to read that. And the forums literally give you a squiggly red line under your incorrect spelling to help you correct it. I came on here to help you. But it was made difficult due to YOU.
