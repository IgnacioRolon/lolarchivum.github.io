He ducked lower to the ground, a hand grabbing his black hat. \n\n&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t know! Thought I heard bells or somethin&rsquo;!&rdquo;\n\n&ldquo;Guess what, Graves? I don&rsquo;t really care right now! Not when all that&rsquo;s between us and dying from many many bullets, is a tiny, wooden table!&rdquo; Twisted Fate yelped as a chunk of the valiant wooden table splintered onto him. &ldquo;Of all the rotten luck, the damn loot had to belong to Fortune! And now we got her whole bloody town after us. There has to be thirty of them out there! So we&rsquo;re going to die and I blame you!&rdquo; \n\n&ldquo;Me? This was your idea! &lsquo;Trust me,&rsquo; you said. &lsquo;This is foolproof,&rsquo; you said. &lsquo;Two idiots can do this with their eyes closed,&rsquo; you said!&rdquo;\n\n&ldquo;You&rsquo;re the idiot!&rdquo; Another chunk of table exploded as bullets flew all around them. \n\n&ldquo;Ah, stop your damn whining! We&rsquo;ve been in worse spots.&rdquo; Graves took out his one-of-a-kind shotgun, his hands running lovingly across its three barrels. It shone silver in the lamplight. He pulled it open to check if it was loaded, and flicked it once more. It closed with a satisfying crack. \n\n&ldquo;You ready, boy?&rdquo; he said, his eyes gleaming as he held the gun to his cheek. He sported a feral grin. \n\nTwisted Fate gave Graves a pointed look, then broke into a wide smile. He made a quick motion with his right hand, revealing a set of cards. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s not gambling if you can&rsquo;t lose,&rdquo; he said. Graves laughed.\n\nThey rose from the table. \n\n\n**II**\n\nPoppy was in battle. And boy, was this a doozy of one! She had been in battles before but never in one this hard. \n\nNever against a dragon. \n\nAnd this was a big one! As big as a castle! And with a mean-looking face that spouted fire from its mouth. She was having a hard time running from all that fire. Yordles were quick, and she was faster than the average Yordle, but that&rsquo;s a lot of running to do. She was now hiding behind a rock, hoping to catch her breath. She could hear the dragon searching for her.\n\nShe peeked out. She could see the hero lying on the ground, unmoving. The dragon&rsquo;s tail had hit him and sent him flying. He had not moved since. Before facing the dragon, the hero had told her all about his exploits in facing monsters. It was very impressive. She thought he could be the one to hold Orlun&rsquo;s hammer and her quest would be over. \n\n_I don&rsquo;t think that&rsquo;s going to happen now._\n\nThe ground trembled as the dragon roared. It had found her. And It sounded hungry. To be perfectly honest with herself, Poppy was scared. This was a dragon. A beast without master. And she was just a small yordle. If even a great hero could be bested, what chance did she have? She didn&rsquo;t think she would even be more than an appetizer for it. \n\n_If not me, then who?_\n\nIt was true. If she didn&rsquo;t stop the dragon here, many villages would be in danger. And many innocents would die. She couldn&rsquo;t allow that to happen.\n\n_It is when you protect the weak, that you find courage to move forward_, whispered Orlun.\n\nPoppy took a deep breath and heard the tinkling of bells. She felt calmer. She knew what to do. She smiled and raised Orlun&rsquo;s hammer, ready to show the dragon that even Yordles could give it a hard time. When she saw the dragon stoop down with its giant maw to gulp her up, she leapt out, her hammer swinging with all her might. \n\nAnd woke up. \n\nShe found herself under a tree, the sun overhead and a light breeze on her face. Orlun&rsquo;s hammer was by her side. &ldquo;A dream huh?&rdquo; she said after a while, then stood up with a grin. She picked up the hammer. Her quest was not over yet.  \n\n\n**III**\n\nEvery swing of his axe was death. Every bandit that had dared challenge him met death. He was Death incarnate, and it showed with the pile of bodies at his feet. These fallen were all weak and they all paid with their lives.\n\n_This one though_, thought Darius, the Hand of Noxus, _this one is different_. \n\nHe regarded the enemy before him, a youth in a black tunic. He carried a slight sword which had already claimed the lives of many of Darius&rsquo;s men. Yes, this one was skilled.\n\nHe beckoned to his challenger. The youth replied by dashing forth, his blade in a glittering arc for Darius&rsquo;s neck. Darius backed away at the last instant, the sword missing by a hairsbreadth, and in one smooth motion, swung his axe upwards. His attacker, realising the danger, leapt to safety with a quick somersault, bringing his blade up in defence. \n\nDarius laughed, a hard sound. &ldquo;You have skill, boy! But I do not think you can best me!&rdquo;\n\n&ldquo;You killed my family! You killed my people!&rdquo; The youth&rsquo;s voice quivered with hate. &ldquo;I do this for Ionia!&rdquo;\n\n&ldquo;Ah, vengeance huh? A noble goal. Your people fought hard against us. What a glorious war!&rdquo;\n\n&ldquo;You dare make light of this! You gave us slavery and blood! So in return, I will have the Hand&rsquo;s head!&rdquo; \n\nDarius raised his axe, his eyes glittering with menace. He thought he heard the tinkling of bells.\n\n&ldquo;Then come get it, boy!&rdquo; \n\nThe youth dashed forward again, impossibly quick, and stabbed out, the strike poised for his heart. Darius blocked it easily with the axe&rsquo;s haft and moved for a riposte but his attacker rolled to his right and slashed out for his throat. Surprised, the warrior stepped back only just in time, the blade missing this throat but sliding past his cheek, leaving a bloody gash. Emboldened, the youth moved in for the kill just as Darius stepped back inside, his right gauntlet smashing into the challenger&rsquo;s face. There was an audible crack as the youth&rsquo;s head snapped back and he stumbled to the ground with a cry. He got up just in time to see a flash of silver as Darius severed his neck cleanly. The body joined the others on the unforgiving ground. \n\nDarius looked at the fallen challenger, his crimson blood flowing freely down his cheek. \n\n&ldquo;Strength above all,&rdquo; he whispered. \n\n\n**IV**\n\nBard floated through the air, the tinkling of bells in the celestial's wake. It was satisfied. Today had been the most interesting day, full of the most interesting stories. It had soared with a Cryophoenix&rsquo;s flight in Freljord, chanced upon a mage&rsquo;s duel, seen a Yordle dream and a Yordle cry. It had hidden in the Shadow Isles and contemplated with the masters of Ionia. It had prayed with a Kraken Priestess and danced to fiddles in Bilgewater. It had witnessed love and life. And death. \n\nAnd it was death Bard found on the whispering sands of Shurima. Before the celestial, an overturned caravan, blazing with fire at dusk. It had probably been attacked by bandits. There were four bodies on the ground, all but one unmoving. A young boy, no more than ten years of age, writhed about. He had an arrow in his side and moaned weakly. Even with a healing spell, the boy would not make it through the night. \n\nStill, Bard wanted to try, and had a spell ready on its lips when it made out white smoke silently floating above the boy. The smoke hovered there for a moment and settled into a child-like shape. The shape carried a bow on its shoulder and wore a mask. It bent down to the boy, and reached out a hand, as if beckoning him to take it. Curious, Bard floated nearer for a better look.\n\n&ldquo;You spy on Lamb,&rdquo; said a guttural, hungry voice right next to Bard&rsquo;s ear, &ldquo;Can I eat you?&rdquo; \n\nInstantly, Bard flew up into the air, its heart pounding and the deathly voice still resonating in its being. The celestial spun around and tried to identify its attacker. There was nobody to be seen except for the dead bodies on the ground. There were also no more voices. The young boy had stopped moaning. And moving as well. Bard could see a slight smile on his face.\n\nTired now, Bard flew to Ionia, to the highest mountain peak covered in the thickest of clouds. There, it landed and walked to a nearby tree. The stars sparkled overhead. Bard looked up, sending salutations to the ones it knew. It then sat down, bells tinkling, and pulled out a thin flute. The celestial put the flute to its mouth and thought of the day. \n\nThen, Bard began to play.\n\n\nWord Count: 1498","replies":[]}
