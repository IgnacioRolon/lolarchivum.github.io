I apologise for this, but I am extremely frustrated.\n\nWhen in hell is the new queue coming to OCE!? I&#039;ve heard nothing about it for MONTHS! And don&#039;t you dare give me some obscure answer. I looked it up and all I could find was a load of steaming bull about it coming during &#039;launch&#039; or within a &#039;few weeks&#039;. But nothing has EVER happened! I swear, we always get left behind here, and what&#039;s so hard about implementing it in one region and not in another? Hell, I don&#039;t even know if it&#039;s still up in NA.\nI say this because I just got landed with an absolutely idiotic team which never would&#039;ve happened with this new system. PLEASE tell me the project hasn&#039;t been abandoned and PLEASE tell me it&#039;s coming.
