It negates the need for this champ to buy a pink ward, I also wonder if he can still target akali and twitch or eve if she is in an activated turret range but out of heimers detection range. This might be worth looking into guys.\r\nHas anyone else noticed this? and to add when I experienced this no I was not in turret range yes I know they reveal stealthed units.","replies":[{"poster":"y u feed me","date":"2015-02-12T17:18:22.202+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"thanks for your comments, there was no start and stop between turret, pulses of fire and stealth and unstealthing, hope that makes sense. there were no pink wards neither and was near friendly turret (large base one) not theirs, also happened more than once. I thought maybe the first time their jungler might have been near and have recently smites those birdies, lol forgive me I cant recall their names. You know what I mean.\nThanks","replies":[]},{"poster":"Divoid","date":"2015-01-21T08:43:23.524+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Kha's stealth is very short. turrets react instantaneously.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Sethane","date":"2015-01-20T19:45:32.011+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I know that they can't hit akali while she is stealthed. I use akali against me friend that uses heim. So I know that for sure. But I want too test this kha issue now. Maybe it was just a 1 time thing?","replies":[]}]}
