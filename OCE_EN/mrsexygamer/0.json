It also means that your behaviour in chat is friendly and constructive.\n\nBut if you're 100% sure that your behaviour has been really positive, **in-game and in chat for at least a month**, then it might be a good idea to send in a [support ticket](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/requests/new) asking what you're still doing wrong.\n\nI hope that helps.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Shoozyz","date":"2016-09-13T06:24:56.112+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You don't really deserve rewards, you intentionally fed. {{summoner:11}} ","replies":[]}]}
