Because sometimes people are just dense and alt tabbed and don't even realise. If they miss the banning phase because they weren't quick enough then they deserve that dodge anyway. They should pay attention.\n\nIf someone is still willing to ban a champion you have shadow picked then yes they're just toxic and you'll probably lose anyway.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Sneed","date":"2016-08-01T22:17:16.300+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"i want all lee sin players under plat to understand that they are hot garbage, and that if they select him, i will instant ban him every time\n\nso fuck that","replies":[{"poster":"Nightjar","date":"2016-08-02T01:04:43.429+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Banning someone else's pick in ranked is kinda mean though.

I can never play zilean support even though I have mastery 7 for it and I'm very confident I can win lane with it in ranked, but  whenever I pick it it gets banned by my team. It's supposed to stop troll picks but I get so many threats from my teammates to play a 'meta' support and not useless support like zilean. I like zilean he feels strong and useful and he as a revive, it's amazing but nobody lets me play zilean. I do understand that tank supports are good and all and I can play tank supports but I also want to play zilean because I'm much better with zilean and I get so many threats for reports even if I do well. I am yet to have a game where I do badly with zilean.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Gloric","date":"2016-08-01T11:31:37.722+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It's happened to me a few times as well.
