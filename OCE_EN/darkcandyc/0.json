For starters, unlimited global access onto a single small environment would create painful login queues and server instability. It also prevents us from ensuring a constructive in-game experience since unlimited access means some \"active\" players may have no intention of experimenting with content, looking for bugs or providing feedback. By carefully controlling PBE access, we're better able to foster an environment where testers are positive, active and engaged.\n\nYou can read more about that [HERE](http://na.leagueoflegends.com/en/page/pbe-faq).\n\nIf you really want to be a PBE tester, you can level up an account on NA and apply from there.
