Before that game I put that copy onto a usb stick, put that stick in my second computer, unzipped it to a directory, loaded it up and.....downloading 800mb patch. I&#039;ve done this before and it&#039;s the exact same thing, if you copy a working copy of LoL onto a new computer, it has some huge crap patch that I know it doesn&#039;t need.\r\n\r\nWhy does it have to patch an up to date version with a 6-800mb patch every time I do this?","replies":[{"poster":"SephirothSG","date":"2016-01-30T22:47:52.583+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey there,\n\nLoL is not intended to be portable, it has many dependencies that are needed for the game to run correctly, however try the following.\n\nOn your target machine install LoL as normal, don't wait for the patcher to download the game, instead close the patcher and then copy your already patched installation over to the target machines league of legends directory.
