Once I click that I can no longer access the normal store and my summoner profile page comes up empty too. If on the rare occasion it opens, trying to turn my key fragments into a key causes it to lose connection. I have had it work slowly over time, making keys, unboxing and recrafting a skin into a permanent, but it always takes multiple attempts. This hasn&#039;t been much of a problem so far since S ranks aren&#039;t that common for me, but now I actually have another chest that i&#039;d like to unbox and i&#039;ve been trying for days to join the key fragments. \r\n\r\nI had a quick look at the sticky about common problems and my IE works fine, I just recently bought Graves from the normal store whilst having these Hextech issues and unless I click on the Hextech inventory everything works just fine so i&#039;m not really sure what it could be.","replies":[{"poster":"Rxmondd","date":"2016-04-24T16:20:54.047+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Same problem :'(. have few chests and keys but not able to use them\nit was working fine in the previous patch, like when it just started, but with the update of new patch, can't access hextech system anymore :<","replies":[]},{"poster":"ToeFetish","date":"2016-04-24T07:28:32.760+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I have the same problem happens every time","replies":[]},{"poster":"tinksywinksy","date":"2016-04-12T14:02:04.432+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Amen to this.
