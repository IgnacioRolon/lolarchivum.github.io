I urge to Riot give twisted treeline more server time towards the end of the season so that the players of that queue can make that final push they need! Otherwise I just don&#039;t think many people will be able to get that graves chroma or just the shiny boarder for that queue\n{{item:3073}} {{item:3073}} {{item:3073}} \n\n{{sticker:zombie-nunu-tears}}","replies":[]}
