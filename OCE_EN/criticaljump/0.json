Along with this is the amusing NURF mode (did this mode really happen?).\r\nSo, I thought of a new idea. What if there was a new game mode- one which would completely change the way the game is played?\r\nIn this game mode, WURF, players would take crazy risks to reap large rewards. The main example of this I have thought of is the idea that players would get really good incentives for tower-diving people- like getting double gold for killing someone under their tower, or even more if they die in the process. If the enemy is on a killstreak, shutting them down (and dying in the process) could net similar results. \r\nI&#039;m imagining people jumping into turrets all over the Rift.\r\nWurf.","replies":[{"poster":"XxSonOfMercyxX","date":"2015-09-05T06:29:14.756+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Sounds good","replies":[]},{"poster":"Hayho Of Okaihau","date":"2015-09-04T22:48:34.866+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"sounds interesting and funny","replies":[]}]}
