Fixed some errors that looked funky on an actual 4k monitor because it seems the artist rushed some parts. Currently there is Katarina  and Nidalee  done, Jinx up next just taking awhile due to the particle effects used in the image.\n\nIf there are some other league or other wallpapers with an logo, marring its wallpaper-iness? then pm me or mention it here probs will do it if its a nice one.\n\n*The link to imgur is [here](http://imgur.com/a/92k2k)*\n\nEnjoy the clean high resolution wallpapers :P  {{summoner:1}} \n-Xamanthas/Helmet Bro","replies":[{"poster":"GoldenTomat0","date":"2015-02-16T10:29:13.275+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"why not just link the photos here directly.
