If they decline they have to wait 20 minutes before trying again (deter cheating the system)\r\nThis queue is basically a way to make IP as no matter if you win or lose you get an amount according to if the team you are filling liked you\r\n*50IP* for each vote at end game. (This will deter bots, etc)\r\n\r\nIf the player that went afk tries to rejoin the current player that took over will get a message to let them take over again or not\r\nIf they let them take over again there will still be a vote at end game to give them IP\r\n\r\nJust an idea,\r\nWondering what you all thought\r\n\r\n{{summoner:31}} {{summoner:31}} {{summoner:31}} {{summoner:31}} {{summoner:31}} {{summoner:31}} {{summoner:31}} {{summoner:31}} {{summoner:31}} {{summoner:31}} {{summoner:31}} {{summoner:31}} {{summoner:31}} {{summoner:31}} {{summoner:31}} {{summoner:31}} {{summoner:31}} {{summoner:31}} {{summoner:31}} {{summoner:31}} {{summoner:31}} {{summoner:31}} {{summoner:31}} {{summoner:31}} {{summoner:31}} {{summoner:31}}","replies":[{"poster":"godsmustbecrazy3","date":"2015-02-12T16:31:37.489+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Possibly, if they get to choose their own champs and join the left off queue, this would be a great idea.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Project Xayah","date":"2015-02-12T07:28:43.582+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I like the idea, I just don't think many people would use it. You don't get an awful lot of people thinking \"You know what? I want to join a game someone else has left\". It may make few games with a leaver better but, for the most part, there probably wont be a difference.","replies":[]},{"poster":"mid or feed k","date":"2015-02-12T07:06:40.618+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"awww they could just do what dota 2 dose and let you have control of the person lel","replies":[]}]}
