Some champion guides on[ mobafire](http://www.mobafire.com) also include detailed descriptions of things to work on during different parts of the game (laning, mid, late). \n\n_If you have any specific role questions, leave them as comments and I will get back to you_. \n\nOn learning to CS really well, [here is a guide. ](http://imgur.com/orWUCKH)\n\nOne thing I would suggest, is **working on your rune pages** (Hunak). They seem a little everywhere at the moment. You just hit level 21, meaning you can start buying tier 3 runes (which will help significantly). \n\nI would suggest a standard AP & AD page. Most players only use a couple of rune pages regularly, even if they have 20 available. \n\nAD page (cost all up= 8,610 IP)\n**Quints** _(big ones)_   -  3 x attack damage\n**Seal** _(yellow)_   - 9x armour\n**Mark** _(red)_   - 9 x attack damage\n**Glyph** _(blue)_ - 9 x magic resist\n\nAP page (cost all up= 10,455 or 12,300 if you go for AP over MP)\n**Quints** _(big ones)_   -  3 x ability power\n**Seal** _(yellow)_   - 9x armour\n**Mark** _(red)_   - 9 x magic pen\n**Glyph** _(blue)_ - 9 x magic resist or ability power\n\n\nDue to you being able to being able to use the same runes on different pages, it will end up pretty cheap. Especially since the rune price reduction last year. \nThese two rune pages are pretty standard, and as you get more IP you can build more specific pages such as tank pages. \n\nAnother thing to sort out would be your **masteries**. You don't have the full 30 points to invest yet. but you are getting there.\nStart by familiarising yourself with each mastery tree, then the keystone masteries (the ones at the bottom) and then the other masteries. \nSome people like to make the pages when they get into champ select, so the fit specifically with their champion. Some people, like me, like to mostly have their mastery pages made up for them. Once again, good mastery choices are up on _probuilds_ and _mobafire _. Alternatively, you could go look at some of the other players masteries in client. Mine are pretty easy copy and are labelled nicely. \n\nGood luck ♥","replies":[]},{"poster":"Ingénue","date":"2016-03-07T23:37:58.714+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Very broad question.
