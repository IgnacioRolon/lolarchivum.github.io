People AFK for any reason they want, they are toxic and generally ruin the experience for other players.\r\nI had a person AFK because someone else secured the kill from them. Then their response was too bad noob, idc there is no tribunal in OCE.\r\nThis has got to stop, this attitude is SO rife(most likely at lower elo's) that its turning away newer players. Im only a level 20 account and already I don't see myself continuing to play because of this.\r\nHow are you discouraging this behaviour from the less mature/more toxic players? Because obviously an end of game report doesnt do the trick. Sure I can place the fool on my ban list but should this person be allowed to continue to do this to other people playing this game?\r\nPlease can a red respond to what is happening in OCE about either player behaviour or a tribunal or something to ACTIVELY(not passivly becuase obviously it inst working) discourage and reprimand players like this.","replies":[{"poster":"godsmustbecrazy3","date":"2015-01-16T16:51:38.206+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Stop whining already, Riot doing their best.
