Would love to know when exactly its hitting OCE because I&#039;m really keen to play with 10 bans.","replies":[{"poster":"Maraudaur","date":"2017-06-01T09:58:21.122+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey everyone just to provide some context. Currently 10 bans testing in NA only (no other region has it) and only in Normal draft in NA. We will be doing testing for a number of days to make sure its all working as intended and there are no big issues (in terms of bugs but also the behaviours that it might create). \n\nOnce testing is done and everything is all good it will begin rolling out globally. Unfortunately I don't have a hard time frame for you there it all depends on how the tests go. Hopefully that provides some clarity on the subject.","replies":[{"poster":"MLC Taunted","date":"2017-06-01T10:16:40.510+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Well, that's disappointing as I assumed we were getting it with the patch, but the clarity about this is much appreciated either way.
