Problem was that there was a premade team who also wanted to go bot so they instalocked. By now, it was up to the skin selection so i was still an adc champ. In the end, two people went mid and fed all while flaming me at the time. I was wondering if Riot could do something about these instalockers or if anyone had any similar stories that they had to share? I only did this coz i found this extremely frustrating and upsetting.","replies":[{"poster":"billfred","date":"2015-04-21T00:18:46.472+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Unfortunately there is not a lot you can do about it. What I would suggest is playing team builder as you already have your role selected. It will take you longer to get into a game but at least you are guaranteed to play what you want and not feel like you have wasted 40 mins of your life","replies":[]},{"poster":"sparklefart","date":"2015-04-20T23:27:06.989+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"Im french","replies":[]},{"poster":"Olee","date":"2015-04-20T23:17:35.798+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"lol as much as it would be great for Riot to fix this, this kinda shit will always exist in online gaming.
