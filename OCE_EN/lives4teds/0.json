I think you're inderectly touching more on **why** people report:\n\n+ _Do you report because you want to see less toxicity?_ \n\n+  _Or do you report because you want to \"get payback\" against a certain player for what they did?_\n\nBoth are perfectly normal reasons to report, but they're not equally as constructive. \n\n**Riot** doesn't share specific information about reports because they don't want a \"revenge\" system where people are trying to use reports as a weapon against other summoners. \n\nMany people already fear the system is being abused like this by trolls ATM (e.g triggering players into flaming so you can report them). Giving people summoner names and punishments is going to reward trolls like this. They'll get to know exactly who they screwed over and how badly.\n\n\nThere's also the privacy issue. It would suck if players who are trying to reform get harassed or targeted for their previous mistakes (e.g \"lol this is the loser who got a 14 day ban, feed his lane and instalock his role\").\n\n__*\n\n**This doesn't mean we need less report feedback though!**\n\nWhat we have right now is a little [notification](https://puu.sh/qKJI4/b0930cad21.jpg) that just tells you recently reported someone who got punished.\n\nThis is really slack on Riot's behalf TBH. There needs to be more features like; long term statistics on how many people you've punished, the accuracy of your reports etc. Similar to what we had in the [original tribunal](http://i.stack.imgur.com/v4PxO.jpg) \n\nIt's really important people know that by reporting they are having a big impact on toxicity in League. The idea should be to support people who are reporting because they want to see less toxicity and discourage people from reporting for \"revenge\".\n*\n*\n*\n*\n\nThat's just my thoughts anyway, I thought it might be interesting to share that :D","replies":[{"poster":"XeroFate","date":"2016-09-04T01:01:15.639+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I feel like whenever I report its a combination of the reasons you stated. I want that specific player to be less toxic after they were a **** to me or my team or even the enemy during the match. Unfortunately the majority of my reports are people that end up trolling and mildly flaming instead of any of the currently available options for reports. Any idea on if there will ever be an option to report trolls because I often run into those and find myself staring at a report screen thinking what do I tick in this situation...","replies":[{"poster":"Tele","date":"2016-09-04T02:48:29.020+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"When you say \"trolling\", do you mean people who aren't technically breaking any rules but are still really unpleasant to play with?\n\nHere's a few examples for clarity:\n\n+ Using extremely un-viable strategies like AP Riven.\n+ Stealing CS as support.\n+ Typing \"lol nice play XD\" every time someone dies.","replies":[{"poster":"XeroFate","date":"2016-09-06T02:13:38.754+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"When I say trolling I mean people who will int feed and do so very obviously to anyone playing by doing something like walking into the full enemy team and spamming emotes and then saying in chat \"I'm trying my hardest\" or \"Man they're too good for me\". I believe there was something somewhere a while ago explaining that if you report for intentional feeding and the person doing so still says stuff like that the system that checks for these types of things just ignores the report but I'm not sure if that was ever accurate. Sometimes there are people who like to just follow you around constantly if you annoy them at all and troll by taking every minion or monster you try to attack which is usually quite annoying. I've also been in a couple games where people will just decide to completely ignore the entire team but still say in chat they're trying extremely hard and they always spam an emote while doing so. One thing I've noticed that most trolls have in common is they will accompany any message that denies them trolling with an emote spam like laugh and maybe a few skill shots in random directions when near you. I usually don't consider anything off meta to be trolling because sometimes off meta is just more fun and stealing CS as support just happens sometimes like when a new player is learning how to support or when you forget to stop auto attacking after using attack move.\n\nSorry for the late reply I forgot to check back to see if anyone had replied.","replies":[{"poster":"Tele","date":"2016-09-06T07:09:47.275+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thanks for that, I think I can answer your question now!\n\n> _Any idea on if there will ever be an option to report trolls?_\n\n+ So what you're looking for sounds like the tribunal. \n\n The systems we have now work well, but I'll admit they probably struggle on situations where it's not immediately clear what's happening (like the jungle troll you mentioned).\n\n The old tribunal was great with stuff like that though. You got entire chat logs, KDA, builds etc. Generally humans will get the context pretty quick and issue punishment if they need to. This would be the system to get all those nuisance variety of trolls punished.\n\nRight now **Riot**'s in the process of reworking the tribunal, so hopefully we get to see it again soon :D","replies":[]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Glow","date":"2016-09-02T07:21:37.123+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"There is a feature like this that is already in place; if you report someone and it causes the instant feedback system to issue a punishment, you will get a client notification saying so :)","replies":[{"poster":"OICU","date":"2016-09-02T08:40:36.306+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"well obviously people are neither being banned nor punished for feeding, AFK or abusive behavior","replies":[]}]}]}
