Even back a few years, it only took me about a month of casual play to level from 1-30, and with all the changes made since then, I reckon I could do it within a couple of weeks, or even within a week if I played \"full bore\".\n\nHonestly, I feel like it could be reasonably argued that it's actually *too easy* to level accounts now. With some of the more recent changes (such as uncapped levelling), most players wouldn't feel the need to have more than one or two accounts, as there is now always a sense of progression in-game (even when excluding Ranked). I honestly feel that the majority of new accounts now are simply toxic players, or botters/sellers, who are just levelling accounts to circumvent punishments, or make money off them (in the case of botters/sellers), and it's just too easy now.\n\nHaving looked at your match history through several third party websites (such as OP.GG and LoLKing), none of them actually show *any* matches, which would seem to suggest you haven't played *at all* within the last month, possibly longer. That's not \"casual\", that's \"barely anything\", and quite frankly I'm not surprised that you haven't reached level 30 if that's how often you play...\n\nBottom line, if you want to actually make progress, you're going to need to put more time in than it seems you are. Just play several games per week, and I bet you'll start progressing *much* faster than you have been. Maybe even start with a coop each day you play, just so you can grab a \"free\" win and get the 400XP from the FWotD (about equivalent to 4-6 \"standard\" matches), as that really makes a very significant difference.","replies":[{"poster":"TheLordCatfish","date":"2018-06-10T07:50:09.130+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Several games per week??
