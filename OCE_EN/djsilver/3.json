So It's all shiny and up to date when I launch it.\n____\nOr if you can advise a time when you know that patch is up I could use a scheduled task :) \nWould 5am morning after patch night be about right? \n____","replies":[{"poster":"JasonWazza","date":"2015-03-11T12:07:22.288+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"From my knowledge (very well may be wrong) but shortly after the servers go down, the patch is actually set to go, the reason patches take so long is sorting out their servers with the info (which they can't do until servers are down.)\n\nSo it should be from the 5am down time (might take a while to be setup or something who knows)\n\nBe great if a red could confirm/deny this though.","replies":[]}]}
