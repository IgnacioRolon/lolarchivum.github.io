I have found after using these services that my ISP hosts some of the servers used to provide these tests and has obviously created optimal routing. This leaves me with an inaccurate test result. \r\n\r\nI want to put an idea to Riot to setup a connection tester. Some thing that gives a little more of a in game load test. Some thing like the sites I use that can tell me if my connection will give me an enjoyable game and wont leave my team mates with the problem of been a person down or having some one useless because they lag to much. \r\n\r\nI am really happy with the network testing stuff you guys have been doing and all of mine checks out fine. I just wanted to add the idea, 30 second test that would let me know i had a fair chance of not lagging out in game. \r\n\r\nOr optionally if Riot could advise what would be the best server to test against on speed/ping test that would give a better indication of actual connection.\r\n\r\nJust an idea.\r\nBTW love the boards, look slick with great functionality.","replies":[{"poster":"MasterMirkinen","date":"2014-11-21T11:03:39.495+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I think we have something in place for this (tracert to our servers) but let me grab ToxicHawk and confirm...","replies":[{"poster":"djsilver","date":"2015-03-11T11:32:13.614+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Any chance there was progress on this one?","replies":[]},{"poster":"djsilver","date":"2014-11-21T11:38:22.637+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yea Tracert is good, i more want load test. :) some thing that can test my bandwidth :) \nTy though","replies":[{"poster":"Essembie","date":"2014-11-22T08:33:44.544+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"My internet connection allows some fairly solid loads.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"ABlueQuaker","date":"2014-11-23T00:14:53.221+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yeah. Just ping any stable server (google and even facebook are probably safe bets). The only time you should have an issue is if the servers themselves crap out on us in which case it will affect everyone anyway. I use a continuous ping test when I load up for a game of LoL. As soon as it goes up for 5+ pings I leave queue or dodge lobby if it looks like it will cause issues for me in game.\n\nping www.google.com.au -t\n\n...and to end the ping test...\n\nCtrl + C","replies":[]},{"poster":"P1 GTR","date":"2014-11-21T10:57:26.289+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"pretty sure you can use the google homepage to test","replies":[]}]}
