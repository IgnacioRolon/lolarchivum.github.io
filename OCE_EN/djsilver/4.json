By the time I am at 50% my ping has shifted down to about 30, by the time I am at 100% I am bouncing around 25. I have also noticed similar behavior on different connections with different pings but always a reduction. \r\n\r\nI want to know how you do it? Is this technology you have built in to the client, or is it just good old ARP, tcp and spanning tree doing their thing? \r\nI would guess it is some how related to route optimization but i really want to know how this magic works :)\r\n\r\nAny one with suggestions I am really interested","replies":[{"poster":"sparklefart","date":"2015-03-11T00:46:57.149+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"dodo provides","replies":[]},{"poster":"Crusader charlie","date":"2015-03-10T22:13:56.427+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"loose lips sink ships","replies":[]},{"poster":"Sackboy","date":"2015-03-10T15:14:57.817+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Better internet.","replies":[]},{"poster":"djsilver","date":"2015-03-11T11:32:45.425+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Any one?","replies":[]}]}
