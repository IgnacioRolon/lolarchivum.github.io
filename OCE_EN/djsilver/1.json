Citing all those other threads is really gonna help that happen.\n\nBest of luck with this man; if you actually get correspondence with the reds and you help them change the code for the better (which is probably impossible).","replies":[{"poster":"djsilver","date":"2015-03-20T09:34:37.981+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Was more pointing out it wasn't just one :) \nRed boards?","replies":[{"poster":"HORSE OF FORCE","date":"2015-03-20T11:00:38.407+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Ah,\n\nalso by red boards, I mean...\n\noh man, I really gaffed that.
