Banned a champ with no issue. My turn comes to lock in my champ. Hit lock in and nothing happens. Button greys out so I try picking a different champ with the same result. Try picking my original champion but still does the same thing. Now I&#039;ve fallen out of my series and on 76 points. Also blocked from queue temporarily. What the hell is this and why did it happen?\n\nAlso afraid to queue in case this happens again.
