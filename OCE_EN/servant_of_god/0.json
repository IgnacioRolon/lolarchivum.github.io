I just got a &#039;10 Game Chat Restriction&#039; for being toxic. I was flaming 2 people who troll picked champs and intentionally fed. I got quite angry that I had to waste at least 20 min in game with idiots and there&#039;s nothing I could do.\r\n\r\nNow I understand 10 Game Chat Restriction means I can still play games with no chat... but when I click 5vs5 Solo, a message pops up saying,\r\n\r\n&quot;Banned from League of Legends - You can&#039;t enter queue because you are currently banned from playing&quot;.\r\n\r\nPlease see the screenshots of my screen. Anyone know if this is an error? Should it say I&#039;m banned at the main screen? How am I supposed to know how long my ban is?\r\n\r\nThanks...\r\n\r\n[](http://imgur.com/TcNxE1P)","replies":[{"poster":"Dota3iscoming","date":"2016-07-21T12:49:02.750+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I feel you man lol, try just muting them or just ignoring them next time not worth, Trust me i know from experience.

I always fall into the trap of fighting with trolls. It's a stupid reporting system. If I get abused by 2 players, and I respond back with abuse defending myself - the two of the report me vs me reporting each of them once.\n\nFML...

Those who are silent and communicate well and those who are toxic and talk too much. You can tell which pre made you have by the 10 min mark. If you see that you have to bottom end just mute them, sure you loose info but half the time they will be all chat talking about someone else mother anyways. Thats how i do it.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"4fy9bEOt7y","date":"2016-07-23T14:37:23.275+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Are you attempting to join Ranked?

I think this was a bug with the 15 minute delay between punishments, but I'm not sure.\n\nFeel free to check back here if you run into any problems :D","replies":[{"poster":"Servant of God","date":"2016-07-23T05:47:29.573+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey Tele,\n\nI submitted one a few hours ago and received an email saying there will be a delay in responding due to high number of tickets etc...\n\nI swear, the only reason I get pee'd off is because of trolls... fml","replies":[{"poster":"Tele","date":"2016-07-23T06:01:05.537+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yeah that message is normal. I've noticed there always seems to be a delay of around 1 - 3 days on tickets.
