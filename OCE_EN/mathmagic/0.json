But as i read and heared it, its of no use above lvl 5. When will we be rewarded wiv titles emotes and/or other stuff if we obtain a hier level? I&#039;ve grown really attached to Cho&#039;Gath. he is my fav champ to play. So it will rise above 5 soon(@3.5 now). was wondering what good it was if developement doesn&#039;t progress?","replies":[{"poster":"Riot Terra","date":"2015-06-10T22:30:47.047+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"In the post you linked it says they will be unlocking more levels eventually (I have no idea when though). I know your levels don't progress right now past 5, but in your profile it does show your champion XP total.

I'd imagine tier 6 to be 50000, tier 7 to be 100000, tier 8 200000 etc. But there's only 2 more tiers assuming Purple and Teal banners are the only ones they'll add.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Yasei Doubutsu","date":"2015-06-11T05:10:48.291+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"That's the best thing I have ever seem XD","replies":[]},{"poster":"DiamondAries","date":"2015-06-11T04:58:11.386+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"This, ladies and gentlemen, is a true sign of a master Donger.","replies":[]},{"poster":"JasonWazza","date":"2015-06-11T04:10:56.345+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"That is disgusting.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Flood","date":"2015-06-11T07:42:07.558+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Lol watched his stream to see that accomplishment.
