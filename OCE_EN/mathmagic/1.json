And i see there&#039;s lots to learn. However my experience, in any game is, that if you are in a clan or team of some sort, your experience enhances, your skill improves(faster) and you&#039;ll learn more about the mechanics and deeper content of a game. Now I am a teamplayer, i don&#039;t mind sacrificing myself if it benefits the team(gettin kills or game advantage). Next to that i am pretty much helpfull. I speak and write 3 languages: Dutch(native) German and English. I got Teamspeak and/or Skype for communicative reasons(am pretty much clan gamer since 2001 - Clanbase 2001 N0. 2 2 on 2 MoH:aa SH realism, No. 5 Clanbase 2001 MoH:AA SH Realism 5 on 5, further CoDUO, CoD2 CoD MW1, MoH:PA BF2142 infantry, BF BC2, BF3 BF4, WoT, WoW 9 years). My champs are so far: Annie, Ashe, Cho&#039;Gath(fav), Morgana, Singed and Soraka. My wishlist: Kassadin, Kha&#039;Zix, Malzahar, Mok&#039;Maw, Rek&#039;Sai, Vel&#039;Koz and Xerath. So if some grp want to train, mold and help me become pro pls inv me in to your clan/team :) Eagor to learn eagor to become better and eagor to be part of a team :p...","replies":[{"poster":"Alamo","date":"2015-06-10T23:54:24.878+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":".","replies":[]}]}
