Out of the 12 games I played today I had to report at least 16 players. Some on my team some on the opposing team. They were reports for verbal abuse, offensive language and negative attitude. It got that bad that I cried twice today. (yes im a sook) And most of it was because me or my team was playing badly. We all have bad games and the abuse isnt going to help that. If I was in the same emotional state as I was 3 years ago things like this abuse may have tipped me over the edge. I log onto LoL to relax and have fun in a world different from my own, but seems I cant do that any more.","replies":[{"poster":"KidneyxThief","date":"2015-08-10T18:00:44.018+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Disable all chat. It really just encourages people trolling.\n\nAlso and this is going to sound really stupid. You need to stop giving a fuck about what people that play this game think or say. I'm so much happier playing now that I've just stopped caring what the playerbase says. They don't know me, and I've come to the conclusion that the opinions of imbeciles and fools don't actually mean that much to me. \n\nAt the first sign of negativity...mute, and just concentrate on doing your best.\n\nAlso listen to disco. It helps. :-p \n\nGood luck.","replies":[{"poster":"DrMattie","date":"2015-08-10T19:58:19.639+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"That's what I did as well, after I stopped listening to their abuse and trying to defend myself I went from B5 to Silver 3 95LP in less than a month. It works wonders, now I just sit back and laugh at the abuse being thrown it's actually funny to take a step back and think about the things they are saying and how dumb it makes them sound.","replies":[]},{"poster":"ThatJaimiKid","date":"2015-08-16T01:50:14.908+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I did do that for a while when it was really bad.

You can tell what type of person they are in champion select, but if they don't make any comments there  then maybe give them the benefit of the doubt but as soon as they start making a negative comment towards your play or anybody else in your and the enemy's team, then simply mute them.\n____\nI've never actually ever muted a player in the history of my game life in League. I simply, (**eventually**) found it easy to ignore players once I got into the mindset of *really starting* to get better at League. Don't get me wrong, it does get to me whenever someone puts you down in chat, but my head is still strongly within the game. If I begin to realise that I'm pondering too much on that one negative comment someone made about it, I simply put it aside, forget it, and tell to myself that \"I will get better, I do suck at this champion, or at doing this, that doesn't matter right now all that matters is that, I am working towards being a better player.\" That's all that anyone should really ask of you. You're aiming to improve there is nothing wrong about that. It's a small victory every time I manage to set that in place in my head. Of course it only is when you actually strive to get better at the game.\n____\nIf you're too tired and can't be fucked focussing at that then get premades and do skype/TS calls. If you somehow can't do that then League is a hostile place until you can get those. \n____\n**Don't** respond to negative comments about you or anyone else. It's not going to help *anybody*, you'll be classified as on the 'other', 'faggot', 'noob' group that would exist within your team as soon as the flamers, ragers and depressing defeatists start spewing shit in chat. The chat atmosphere does get much much more mature (doesn't necessarily mean that there are less arguments) as you climb higher and higher in skill, but for the meantime, just do it, mute them whenever necessary.\nWith the rework of the HUD, muting is as easy as tabbing and clicking on the speaker symbol on the player/champion portrait or to type /mute <playername> in chat.\nAnother simple trick is to go into settings and lower the size of chat to its most minimum size whilst maximising the size of your minimap. It helps you see enemy and team positioning way better - make it a habit that you glance over the minimap every few seconds when skirmishes start happening because the midlaner could come and gank you, or their jungler comes to gank you and succesfully kills you when you had a ward placed there. Should always buy a ward if you have at least 75 spare gold, which you should work up to easily having every back. Plenty of tips and tricks on trying to get better in Youtube alone.\nLowering chat size helps you focus on the game and not on the ragefest happening in chat between two or more people in the match.\n\nIf someone insults you and makes negative comments about you, the best thing to do is ignore them and focus on bettering your everything (csing, map awareness, decision making etc. as well as winning the match. Work at not letting random people's comments get you down, truthfully, it doesn't fucking matter what they think of you or what they think you should do, as long as you are striving to getting better at the game and having fun working towards those awesome plays. At least that's what I find fun aside from playing with friends. \n\nGL; and hope you HF.","replies":[{"poster":"ThatJaimiKid","date":"2015-08-16T01:54:21.989+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Some great food for thought there thank you :) And I didnt know you could change the size of chat and map, will defiantly do that!","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Jehovahs Witness","date":"2015-08-11T00:32:04.849+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'm Unranked but I don't mind playing a couple of normal games with you if you want to.
