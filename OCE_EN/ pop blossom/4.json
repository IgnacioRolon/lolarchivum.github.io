I&#039;m looking to create a team to both learn from and grow strong with. I&#039;m seeking players that are relitively friendly and can hold there own weight. I don&#039;t really care about rank (because that would make me a hypocrite) as some players are more team orriented and have trouble climbing the ladder. \n\nCurrent have all lanes open. Anyone that wishes to join can either leave a comment with prefered role here and ign or message me directly on league at &quot;Hnp dawg&quot;.\n\nSchedule is no existant but would most likely be any day of the week from 5 (EST).\n\nMic is required.\n\nThank you for taking the time to reading this.\n- Harrison\n{{summoner:31}}","replies":[]}
