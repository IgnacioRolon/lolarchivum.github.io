More than likely you either shared the account with someone who used cheats (usually a booster or a**hole friend) or your account was compromised.\n\nIn the case of the first, you aren't going to get the account back.\n\nIn the case of the second, continue with your ticket and explain the situation. They will ask you to secure your account (change your PW) and will ask you a whole bunch of ownership verification questions. Once the account is secure and ownership is confirmed they'll give the account back.","replies":[]},{"poster":"BarryButcher","date":"2017-05-12T14:13:49.334+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You should get an email detailing what it was for.\n\nAs that message suggests, contact support and they will tell you.","replies":[{"poster":"Right Boobie","date":"2017-05-12T14:59:52.645+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"No email to what i was banned for, been trying to contact support but they just bladder no sence","replies":[]}]}]}
