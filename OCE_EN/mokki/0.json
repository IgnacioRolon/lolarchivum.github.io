They boast and call others trash at the game and nobody can really put them in their place when they don&#039;t play front line champions that actually put their skills to test. And jfc support mains seem like such weaboo cucks, I honestly imagine them as 40 year old basement dwelling neets who rub one out to Janna.","replies":[]}
