Help me","subforum":"Player Behaviour","up_votes":2,"down_votes":2,"body":"TL;DR Banned because I was hacked\n\nWelp, Been here before complaining about a ban but this time its different. Last time I was toxic and I completely understand that and my account was permanently suspended, rightfully so. This time, apparently I broke ToS, I have no idea what I&#039;ve done, although some fishy behaviour has happened without the last 24 hours.\n \nAs of making this post, last night my account was hacked and the hacker played with a full premade team for 3 games then presumably logged off (all after I went to bed). I found out this morning because I had a terrible nunu game so I checked my op.gg to see what my MMR went down to, and then something caught my eye, apparently, I played Ahri, Cassiopeia and Veigar with a full team of 5 none of which the account names I recognize. I immediately changed my password then contacted support then changed my password for a second time. I then played a fiora game in ranked and did terribly again. Logged off to cool off and take a break. But then I came back with a ban? \n\nI went to my email address associated with my account and was greeted witha message titled &quot; Disciplinary Action from League of Legends! &quot;\n\nMessage below\n----------------------------------------------\nGreetings overburn,\n\nActions that have been performed on your account are in violation of the League of Legends Terms of Use. You can review these terms at http://www.leagueoflegends.com/legal/termsofuse\n\nDue to the severity of this violation, your League of Legends account has been banned until Thu Jan 01 00:00:00 UTC 9001\n\nIf you have any questions, contact our Player Support team at https://support.leagueoflegends.com/home\n\nRiot Games Player Support\n\n----------------------------------------------\n\nWow, thanks riot that helps, now im getting really anxious because of the money I&#039;ve spent on this game on both accounts I&#039;ve owned.\n\nIm just hoping this is a big misunderstanding because I believe im innocent and have not broken any terms of use.\n\nThank you for reading\n\nEdit: Here are some screenshots\n\nScreenshot 1: https://imgur.com/a/RxwpxfY This is the message I get when trying to login to my account\n\nScreenshot 2: https://imgur.com/a/DPj7eYh This is of the games that I, the owner of the account did not play","replies":[{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2018-04-21T08:19:59.422+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"You mentioned you ticketed support that your account was compromised? It sounds like it was probably a security ban. It's basically a permanent ban they put on the account when there is evidence of suspicious activity. Given you don't know how your login details were acquired in the first place, it's possible your account still isn't secure.\n\nFirst I'd recommend changing the password to any associated email addresses as well, then I'd recommend submitting a ticket to support again. They will most likely ask you to submit an account recovery from there. Assuming a security ban is the case they will unban the account once ownership has been proven.","replies":[{"poster":"TF Blade","date":"2018-04-21T13:07:09.981+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":2,"body":"Im gone, I cant express how dissapointed and how betrayed I feel, I am completeley innocent and I have lost a thousand dollars worth of items.

If I'm not mistaken, the most likely cause of a compromise would be that someone gained access to the account by using keyloggers or a virus/malware etc program inserted onto a computer that you've used the account on. Considering that, I'd certainly recommend you run a full scan on any personal/family computers you use with whatever antivirus program(s) is/are installed, and I would also recommend downloading Malwarebytes, as that seems to find certain stuff that other antivirus programs miss. I would also recommend the same for any friends/associated computers you've used.\n\nAs for any public computers you use, it's simply a case of \"checking\" them before you use them. Doing simple things like opening Task Manager (for windows, or equivalents for other OS) to check for any programs/processes/services that shouldn't be running and/or are suspicious and checking all the connected devices (particularly keyboards) for anything that shouldn't be there (such as a keylogger device), assuming the connection points are accessible, would help prevent any compromise. If you do happen to find something, it's best to inform whoever owns/maintains the computer so they can take action and ensure the security of the computer and customers details is maintained.","replies":[{"poster":"TF Blade","date":"2018-04-22T01:37:55.250+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"I ran a full computer scan and nothing was found, I'm at a loss.","replies":[{"poster":"TF Blade","date":"2018-04-22T01:44:21.868+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"I downloaded MalwareBytes and I found out I had 3 Registry Key Viruses.

In both cases the account stays banned, but for the former (or if the latter is misidentified) you *should* get it back assuming there's no info we're missing here on boards (like multiple compromises, more than one person with persistent access to the account etc). You've given me no particular reason to doubt what you've said, but I don't like to speak in absolutes because people *do* lie on boards. I've asked someone to take a second look for you but you'll have to hang tight :)\n\nViruses, common passwords and hacked emails are (seemingly at least) the most often culprits for losing your login info to a malicious party, so they're definitely things to keep an eye on, especially when there is money involved. Just remember that this lesson doesn't only apply to your League account. If you suspect it was in fact a keylogger virus, now it's removed you should change any passwords that are important like bank passwords and the like. They can be a lot worse to lose than a League account.","replies":[{"poster":"TF Blade","date":"2018-04-22T02:16:54.431+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"You have no idea how thankful I am for you doing this, whether or not I get it back I'm just so so so grateful for your help.
