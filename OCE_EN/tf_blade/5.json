Stop being blinded by the money and look at your community. As someone whos played since late season 3 I&#039;ve never wanted to quit the game more.  I play it and play it and try to enjoy playing new champions but I&#039;m just denied by this level up to buy new champions or just give riot some quick cash and no need to level. It&#039;s really stupid.\r\n\r\nMy first point I&#039;d like to talk about and this is the revamped loot system (Orange Essence). Riot have TOTALLY hidden the changes from us aside from a notification that told us that they are &quot;changing the prices&quot; and that we might want to &quot;sell all of our skin shards&quot;. Other than that, there has been no  official thread posted explaining anything. This is a really scummy move by Riot and left lots of players questioning why it costs so much Orange Essence to get a skin compared to the ratio of before the revamp.\r\n\r\nAnother point I&#039;d like to make is the whole Blue Essence earning system. Now before I say anything I will point out that Riot has added the 50 Blue Essence along with the first win of the day bonus but even then I believe its taking away from how much BE we earn. The fact that you have to play/win about 5-7 games to get a level is ridiculous. Now I&#039;m all fine with the unlimited leveling system but what myself and most of the community dont like is that you play those 5-7 games to get a couple of champions worth 90 BE and maybe one 400 BE champion if you&#039;re lucky. In the old system you would get 300(?) IP per win of the day and thats just from a singular game. I think you get the idea.\r\n\r\nRiots Customer Support is **_Terrible_**. I must emphasize on this because its almost as bad as valves if not worse. 9 times out of 10 you will just receive a copy and pasted response from Riot Support and it takes even days to get this. I mean, if you&#039;re going to take days to respond and least make it personal instead of finding some pre-written response. Since I&#039;m on the topic of Customer Support, the Chat ban system is absolute ASS, Yes you get banned for saying shit like KYS and homophobic slurs but not even this is 100% of the time [Check [THIS](https://boards.oce.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/miscellaneous/Rc4RYyVl-reported-someone-who-told-me-to-kill-myself-and-called-me-a-got-but-got-no-instant-feedback?)]. Now I don&#039;t know if this is because I&#039;ve received penalties before or because im below honor level 2 but player reports should stlil be taken seriously, Riot can say that they do but they dont do shit, they let a bot scan over chat logs and if it detects a trigger word you get banned. You can go to support. They wont do anything but give you another copy pasted answer. At this point I feel like they want us to make new accounts so we pour more money into their bank accounts so we can play champions we used to enjoy playing on our accounts we can no longer access because of Riots terrible Automated and &quot;irreversible&quot; System.\r\n\r\nTo end this wall of text off I&#039;d just like to say I hope someone does something about this before the community ends up dying. League of Legends is a great game, I cannot say the same thing about the behind the scenes. Thank you. \r\n\r\n#BringBackLeague","replies":[{"poster":"Fitzky","date":"2017-11-29T10:09:25.881+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"The boards has been filled with this kind of feedback ever since preseason hit, amount of Riot responses: 0","replies":[{"poster":"Lord Sesshomaru","date":"2017-11-29T11:37:07.557+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"They know they fucked up.. \n_(Unless they don't... which then presents a much bigger problem)_\n\nSo they are probably either:\n\n1.

Especially the whole blue essence thing.\n\nIll disagree with you on the customer support though, I used to think it was sub-par, and then I used other customer support services and realise that the Riot one is actually quite good in comparison!\n\n______________\n\nHeres an anecdote explaining that:\n\nI play ESO more and more now, _(partially due to the terrible decisions made in league)_, I pre ordered the game several years ago when it came out, but never really played it. Recently I started playing it a lot, so I redeemed some of the exclusive codes that came with the pre-order edition, all the codes except 1, I was able to redeem. _(there was no expiry date anywhere on any of the codes)_\n\nSo I mailed support _(using some subheading like 'payment issue' because they didn't even have the option to use any other headings than \"Bug Report [NO REPLY]\", \"Character Stuck [NO REPLY], and \"Payment Issue [REPLY]\")_ I explained the situation, gave them the code, and asked if they could redeem it. The support guy emailed be back a couple of days later, and he asked for this massive list of things to prove that I was the owner of the game, that I actually had the code etc etc. So I sent him all these pictures of the box and me holding the code, and serial numbers etc, the whole works! The only thing I couldn't provide was the receipt _(I'm not in the habit of keeping 4 year old receipts)_. And he said he couldn't do anything without that proof of purchase. \n\n i searched and searched and couldn't find anything, not In my bank statements or anywhere else. So as a last resort I rang up EB games, got transferred to the AU headquarters and had this poor girl search my entire EB games history for like an hour _(thats a LOT of RP card purchases)_, until she found an ESO purchase. It then confused matters that she found the PS4 version I had purchased a year or so after the computer one _(because you didn't need a subscription to play that version at the time)_, so then she had to search all over again. eventually she found it and managed to email me a full receipt and everything, all the technical and legal information the support guy had asked for.\n\nI emailed the support guy and showed the final piece of information. To which, his reply almost word for word was:\n_\"But. this code is expired, its **impossible** for us to redeem this anyway.\"_\n\nWhich of course, begs the question why I needed to jump through all those hoops in the first place? It also begs the question, how can a series of numbers expire? also, why was there no written expiration date anywhere on the box?\n\nSo then I asked if he could transfer the _still valid_ PS4 downloadable content code, to the PC version. To which his answer was _\"Thats absolutely **impossible**.\"_\nNow I don't know much about coding, but I'm pretty sure nothing is ever impossible, and I can imagine it would be a simple matter to unlock existing content on PC, and then block the PS4 code.\n\n\n___________\n\n\nNot to mention the WIX website maker's support _(if you can ever find the button to actually submit a ticket that is, which is so extremely well hidden through so many sub menus that even sherlock holmes may not find it)_. where I got 3 different answers to my query, all of them different and none of them worked. Then I finally got a reply back from someone who knew what he was doing, and the solution was _\"Yea thats just like a glitch in the system or something, it's not actually a problem, just ignore it.\"_....\n\n\n_____________\n\nAnd seeming Riot support has resolved my problem each time without making my run any marathons, even if half of their replies are machine scripted, I'm still a fan  of their player support! _(not to mention you dont have to spend 2 hours watching youtube videos about how to find the suit ticket button.)_\n\n\nwow that turned out to be a long reply xD\n\n\n\n#TL;DR:\nThe changes are crap, Riot needs to address it, or at the very least, admit it.\nBut I think their players support is pretty good in comparison to many others.","replies":[{"poster":"JasonWazza","date":"2017-11-29T11:51:08.646+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":">But I think their players support is pretty good in comparison to many others.\n\nIt's good... when your not getting copy pasted responses.\n\nThe issue tends to be spending the first 2/3 replies trying to get an actual response.","replies":[{"poster":"Lord Sesshomaru","date":"2017-11-29T12:24:27.301+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"But at least you know that you can get a real person, and when you do, they are actually capable of accessing your account and fiddling with whatever problem you have.\n\nIm not saying its the best support system, but its much better than some I have encountered.","replies":[]}]}]}]}
