Teemo is one of the cases where a small reduction in lvl1 mr becomes oppressive.\n\nTeemo doesn't need a nerf, we need mirror shell to become decent. Like conditioning is stronger than either iron skin or mirror shell, and does both.  Iron skin and Mirror shell need a buff to be stronger than conditioning, because conditioning does both and is less interactive.\n\nAlso maybe increase q cooldown just a little.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Niji","date":"2017-12-07T14:43:51.258+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"He needs to be reworked regardless of whether or not he is strong (I don't think he is, just pre-season being bonkers). His kit is binary and very boring to play against. Depending on who he is vs'ing his ult is trash or great but that being said most of the time its the former because even gold and up knows how to sweep and red ward. Outside of his ult all he has is point and click q, his passive dot and a \"run away\" button.\n\nI feel like his blind should either be a skillshot (still let it go past minions) or be like Quinn's Q (nearsighted) so that if a melee gets on top of him they can still fight him. His poison dot is fine as is his w even if its a bit boring but his ult also needs changes. Its too reliant on the enemy teams skill level and also pretty boring if his ult could be buffed while still keeping it shroom themed and making it a bit less underwhelming that'd be nice.","replies":[{"poster":"Nightjar","date":"2017-12-08T00:54:53.067+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I like premeditated champions personally, realistically that means all I have is shaco and teemo for that, and I don't like how riot and everyone else keeps trying to remove them. If someone baits you into a trap that puts them at an advantage, that isn't gimmicky, there was real strategy and alot of planning was involved in setting that up. \n\nAs an ex-teemo main (he is kind of bad for teamcomp, and has a few near unwinnable matchups and so is more of a counterpick than a solid pick), I feel the ult and how you plan it is more skill expressive than you might believe, and for teemo mains is a very satisfying part of his kit (as annoying as it is for everyone else in the game).\n\nI think teemo's q being a skillshot is fine, but I feel that since teemo's niche is generally being a counterpick to autobased carry toplaners, it shouldn't be changed to be like quinns blind. Counterpicks feel bad but I think they're a healthy part of the game provided that the champion has weaknesses through either being countered themselves, or through weakening the teamcomp.\n\nA thought I'd had since I first started league was, that if you had to 'update' teemo's kit, you'd probably try reducing his aa range, and then give his w active, a shorter, but more significant movespeed buff that can only be cast when in close proximity to an enemy champion, forcing him to more aggressively focus on kiting, and play around short trades, rather than just hitting you with an auto when you try to cs and harassing you out of lane with a passive play style. A more risk/reward style gameplan. Changing his e to be more like shen's q or kled's violent tendencies, giving a small amount of bonus magic damage per level (much less than current onhit), but allowing you to activate it as an ability for a significant increase in damage for the next 3 autos which stack poison stacks, would make his trading power more obvious. If he could get all his autos off on you, then you'd take alot more damage, but if you could avoid this trade or reduce the number of e charges he could get off, then he'd have done alot less damage and burn, and he'd wouldn't have as much trading power available to him until the cooldown returns. It would also encourage teemo's to make better use of their stealth's extra atkspeed, to help them get all 3 autos off, and would better enhance the dynamic differences between teemo's ap, onhit and tank builds.","replies":[{"poster":"Niji","date":"2017-12-09T15:08:05.844+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Nightjar,realm=OCE,application-id=Ntey9fRZ,discussion-id=276f7hgo,comment-id=00010000,timestamp=2017-12-08T00:54:53.067+0000)\n>\nsnip\n\nAt the end of the day I trust a Teemo player to know better how to change him.
