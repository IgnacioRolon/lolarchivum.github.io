This is literally my first post. So please bear with me.\n\nMy question or rather the point I want to get clarified is, how or what exactly does the riot AI look for while deciding a person is ban-worthy or not? Because I have heard so many different stories about people getting banned for a single otherwise regular word (nothing vulgar or offensive) and I have witnessed people getting away with way more than just regular words.\n\nConfession: I just got off a game where I called my &quot;jungler&quot; boosted, since he clearly was. AFK farmed for 10mins as a graves when the lanes were constantly over extended and enemy laners were rotating all over the place. He had a gold border and I clearly was surprised how he did get it. So I called him out.\n\nTo which I immediately got called toxic. Now, this word has garnered such a broad meaning that I do not understand what toxicity even means anymore. How was I toxic or how is anyone toxic for saying how the game (where there clearly is a meta created around how it is being played) is to be played in order to win? I did not use any offensive language whatsoever and I was threatened that I would be reported (probably was) xD \n\nSo the point here is how does the system validate such claims (Actual question) ? And why is the community super lightweight (rhetorical) ? {{champion:119}} ","replies":[{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2019-02-13T01:51:12.976+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"In future, the Player Behaviour sub-board is more appropriate.\n\nAs for the system, Riot has pioneered their automated learning system. Nobody can answer the question what *exactly* it looks for because that's not how it works. It's been taught via input what behaviours the community accepts as ok, and what ones it doesn't. \n\nThe disadvantage is that niche (but still obviously negative to a person) behaviours will take a little longer to detect and action. The advantage is that there is no specific list of words or actions that can be avoided to dodge the system and be negative without consequences.\n\nThere are some single words that would more often than not see you punished, but I can assure you they aren't \"otherwise regular words\". We're talking things like 'kys', racial slurs, hate speech. That type of deal, all of which is classed as no tolerance language, and will escalate straight to a 14-day ban for the first offence. It's severe behaviour, an pretty obviously not ok, so you only get the one warning before perma.\n\nJust because someone keeps playing, doesn't mean they weren't punished. The first two punishment tiers are chat restrictions, and while you can be escalated through them as mentioned above, that isn't always the case. There *is* technically a popup that informs you if a report has contributed to punishment, but it should really more be treated as a bonus confirmation that anything else. It's unreliable, and extremely limited in when it appears, so it's not something to stake claims on.\n\nLet me paint you a picture. \n\n>You're playing Pyke support. In a normal no less so you're using this opportunity to play something you don't normally, to practice and to have some fun with something new. Understandably, you aren't a god tier Pyke, you've only played him for a couple games, and the enemy support is frankly just better. You're getting zoned, you got picked a couple times and now the enemy ADC is much stronger than yours. \n\n>This game is hardly indicative of your overall skill since you're in an off role on a new champ, and a squishy one at that. Nevertheless, your ADC is mad that you're dying. Instead of asking you to play a bit safer and wait for the hooks, or wait for jungle pressure, they start abusing you. They're saying you don't deserve your rank, that you should uninstall the game because you're so bad.\n\nIs the ADC calling you out? Or are they being an asshat to someone who's having a bad game, as if they've never had one in their life?\n\nSo yes, you were toxic. You don't have to swear to be toxic. You don't have to use any particular keywords to be toxic. \n\nIt's pretty simple really. Is the intent to put down, hurt, or place unconditional blame on another person? If yes, you're being toxic. Is the intent to garner a negative reaction, or otherwise incite anger in another person? If yes, you're being toxic. Are you lashing out in aggression, and/or deflecting all personal responsibility for a loss (it's a team game people) onto another person, who may or may not have also contributed? If yes, you're being toxic.\n\nIn short, don't be a jerk.\n\nThe system validates claims essentially through past cases. If the community almost universally reports something like \"kys\", it's pretty obviously a behaviour the community doesn't want. If the community only reports the c-word when it's used in an insulting context, then that context is what the system uses to validate current reports.\n\nAs for your rhetorical question, consider it a matter of perspective. Heaven forbid a supposedly intelligent race would have some respect for each other.","replies":[]}]}
