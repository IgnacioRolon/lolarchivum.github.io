I&#039;m genuinely curious if Riot is trying to blend bot lane duos with more than just the typical Marksman-Support lane. With the introduction of Cinderhulk and better health items, ADCs had a hard time dealing with this new tank meta. Marksmen mains this season have been mostly restricted to playing Sivir and Corki, not due to their damage, but due to their utility to their team. In previous seasons, I would be able to pick almost any marksman and be viable to my team, but it is not the case in Season 5. At this point I would expect a sort of item rework or balance changes, but nothing seemed to come out of any patches that improved marksman game play. Instead, AP mages got a new item rework and now Mordekaiser is being introduced as a &quot;bot lane juggernaut&quot; to replace the marksman role. If a Rioter could clue me in, and many other marksmen mains, about the general state of marksmen or if there are plans to phase out marksman-support bot lanes.","replies":[{"poster":"TheDemonEmperor","date":"2015-08-05T00:58:51.409+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"No? they made adc into a role that is a must kill late game. Corki is pick for his damage spike mid game with tri, not for his ultility \"so am pretty sure u dont know what u are talking about at this point\". Sivir is  for pick comp, where she would catch a lone target together with her team mate. Every season has OP champs and bad champs, this inclue adc. \n\nStrictly play sivir and corki? so, do u watch any of the professional scence such as, LCS, LCK, LPL? Vayne, corki, sivir, lucian, kogm, trist, jinx, kalista and am sure there are more being played. Where are u getting ur facts from man? lol.","replies":[]},{"poster":"RageGrace","date":"2015-08-06T00:29:52.033+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I like that you have to pick a specific marksman into a comp. That means all adcs are not interchangeable, and you play to their strength. \nAlthough, imo, Sivir is still a viable pick to most comps these days.","replies":[]},{"poster":"SorakaXHealBoT","date":"2015-08-05T05:53:45.513+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I heard they will be reworking the ad items too.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Ediwir","date":"2015-08-05T00:49:15.985+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Well, marksmen/supports have been steamrolling as the only viable option the past 4 and a half seasons (basically since they came up as an idea back halfway through s1), wouldn't be surprised if rito was trying to create some other options.\n\nHowever, you still need a marksman if you want to take a tower fast enough to avoid respawns...","replies":[]},{"poster":"Talon12","date":"2015-08-04T23:51:48.232+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"the buffed the ap {{item:3031}}  ({{item:3089}}) and nerfing the ad {{item:3089}} ({{item:3031}}) equality for life","replies":[]}]}
