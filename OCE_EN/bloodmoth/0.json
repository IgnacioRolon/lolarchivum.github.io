The only CC i suggested was a small 'knockback' on E, it would hardly make him leona (ie NOT a cc tank!)\nIf i was relying on DFG id be advocating a burst mage playstyle or the fizz treatment, but thats a thematically crappy fit for a hulking death lord and a tanky burst mage is a contradictory playstyle, if your goal is to take out your opponent before he can attack back, you wont need to be tanky!\n\nThey have already decided that they want to reduce his burst and increase his sustained dps, which i agree with but i just dont think that it will ever be satisfying if he can only realistically utilize 2 abilities (e and R) and with his kit on its own he can barely make use of his ult!\n\nThe thing is, with DFG removed he lost his whole 'burst and steal enemy carry' playstyle, what hes left with is 'tanky front line' which is cool, but there is a gaping hole in his kit that the enemy carry used to fill. If he cant reliably kill his target, his ult loses ALOT of its value.\n\nHis playstyle has already changed and what we are left with isnt a good fit for league.\nCan he target lucian/sivir/kalista/ashe/kogmaw(*yesevenkogmaw*) with his ult and kill them with his current kit? he will be kited to hell and back! its not a matter of outplaying the opponent either, he has no tools to cope with that because, guess what! he has no tools! he is just stats! he is just damage and tankiness, nothing else.\nHe will simply destroy anything that cant escape him and get kited to death by anything he cant catch.\n\nHim existing will mean that low mobility champs simply cant exist in the game, because the fact that he has nothing interesting in his kit means that he has to out-damage and out-tank every single other champ in the game to have any chance at being playable.\n\nHis current kit is outdated, they have nowhere to buff him other than damage and tankiness (*other than his thematically unfitting friendship buff*) since he has nothing else. with only those 2 levers he suffers from all the archaic design problems, if hes too weak, you can only buff his damage or tankiness, if hes too strong, you can only nerf his damage or tankiness, if his winrate sucks but his damage and tankiness are already too high, then what do you do? there is nothing else to tune on him! if you add mobility, range or CC to his kit, you add in some new levers to tune him. out of those 3, CC makes the most thematic sense! i also gave an example of a healthy, cohesive and engaging playstyle that would easily fit into his kit without removing anything iconic about him!\n\nWith the removal of DFG, do you think his kit is really playable or cohesive? his ult seems like the most iconic part of his kit, does the rest of his kit support that?","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Schakle","date":"2015-02-17T00:07:45.349+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"I feel like Morde does well as a damage dealer, rather than a tank, but AP bruiser seems to fit him better, with that in mind I feel like he could use a form of engage that doesn't involve flash. Maybe if they made his w a dash? Then where ever he popped up was where the cloud stayed but if slowed enemies in the area? I don't think this would be very long range if it were a thing but immobile champions haven't been viable metapicks for a long time. With that in mind, I still think Morde should feel unique so keeping his movespeed and not adding additional mobility would be pretty sweet. After that, I like the idea of his q spreading a lot further, think brand ultimate, but if there is no one to bounce to, it triggers all of it's hits on the one champ, this is like a more powerful version of Kha q isolation, seeing as you can do more damage to 2 champions as well as just catching 1. Although stacking damage should remove a percentage of the damage anyway to prevent OP one shots. With this dive in catch tank I think we would get a unique but viable champion out of Morde. Without having to change his q to much. But then his passive would make him incredibly tanky if used correctly. Imagine engaging with full shield, having that shield bursted down and then filling it up again with your spell rotations? The AoE DoT slow from w would probably make the team scatter and give you a bit of free time with the backline while your team jumped in with you. You could do a lot of mechanical things to!

His w should be able to be cast on an enemy. I like your idea there, Morde shouldn't be reliant on his allies, or necessarily have any major interactions with them. one variation on this idea is if e is used to create a zone that deals damage per second as well as a armour/mr shred.\n2.  his e should be changed to an inline shill shot that affects all enemies in the line. The cone creates too little counter play, except for stay out of range, which creates a game that's not fun for anyone. Also if his e hits an enemy that's debuffed with w then the enemy is dragged towards morde. This ability would be gated by controlling the cooldown on w.\n\nThis kit would provide a more cohesive game play experience for Morde i think. I feel like it suits Mordes thematic to be an immobile carry, however this allows him to play using his e to poke and waveclear, however he now has to make a decision as to which as he shouldn't be able to do both, if the opponent positions as such. but he can go all in, and needs to (and can) use all of his skills to do so, as if he lands a w, then e, he can complete his combo with a q. \n\nWhile this would be potentially op other champions have similar mechanics (such as Darius), by needing to use two of his skills in succession to secure the pull, mordes required investment in a play is much greater, allowing for a greater reward (Morde does more damage, can potentially get a ghost, possible slightly more range on his e.\n\n\nAnyway let me know what you think","replies":[{"poster":"bloodmoth","date":"2015-02-17T05:49:41.122+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"1: I dont think a ground targeted persistent aoe spell would really suit morde, they tend to be siege moves rather than brawler moves and its a bit of a stretch to change W to one from what it currently is.\nThe idea for my change is to force peelers to distance themselves from their carry to give morde better access for children of the grave, not any particular zone, and remember that mordekaiser will still gain a shield himself, so it doesnt need to be a reliable form of damage for the enemy target.\n\n2: i dont think a short range casted ability needs to really be unreliable, id be in favor of the cone width reduced and having the cone based from the edges of morde (a trapezium more than a cone, sucks hitting stuff thats close) and reducing its width would generally mean more range, which would push him further to the siege mage territory, which heavily clashes with his visuals\n\nHistorically morde has played as a burst mage similar to how gragas was played as a siege mage, gragas really didnt fit that theme though, same goes for morde.\nIf they are looking into him they need to match his gameplay to his theme, which means he should play closer to a bruiser than a mage. if they want him to be a metal/death mage, then they need to make him look less like a tank (more like magneto than sauron i guess) that would require more work than its worth so i maintain that he should be reworked into a bruiser with CC.\n\nWithout adding any CC, range or mobility to his kit, there will be far too much room for tankiness and damage, which creates a boring kit that is overpowered. nobody should have that little utility taken up in their budget!\n\nThe reason i want CC added to the kit is so that his numbers can be tuned to a much more reasonable amount, as it stands, they will need to be obscene in order for him to be played! and out of mobility, range and CC, CC is the one that meshes the best out of all of them!","replies":[{"poster":"the real mcoy","date":"2015-02-17T06:38:45.170+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"I agree with some of your points, perhaps w would be better as a targeted ability, however I think one area where you would run into trouble is if you put enough power into w that the team member has to distance himself from his team then your putting a lot of power into a single point and click ability. Also how would you work it, you didn't really mention the specifics, would it damage the target and all targets around it, only the targets around it or the target and to a lesser extent the targets around it?\nThe reason I feel like the kit I suggested is viable is Morde doesn't have a reliable late game or team fighting combo he can use, as hes very prone to being kited, and its possible (and not that hard) to kite him at the moment without taking any damage. While your kit does provide an some answer to this, I'd like to take the idea further. \nThe play style I'm suggesting would see Morde cast w on his target, followed by e (which would have to be a skill shot), which if it hits would drag the target to Morde, in a similar fashion to a Blitz pull or Darius apprehend, so that he'd be able to follow with q and r. This allows counter play by - cleansing the w with qss, dodging or spell shielding the e, or just baiting the w then retreating. \nThe play pattern I'm describing would be more suited to a burst mage, however it would possible to play with his numbers and shield mechanic to create him as a bruiser. \nThe reason I think e would have to be an inline skill shot, is to add unreliability and counter play to an otherwise strong kit, and getting hit late game by both w and e should be a guaranteed death if its hits a squishy, particularly if the team is there to follow up. So to counter balance this e is made a little harder to hit, as well as less effective at wave clearing (possibly affects all creeps in a line but only one champion, ensuring Morde has to take risks to snare a carry and position well etc. \nWhile I guess the kit would be strong, getting hit by and ahri charm or a blitz hook is just as deadly, and Morde could remain immobile with this kit, creating a kit with a clear playstyle, as well as creating more defined strengths and weaknesses for Morde.","replies":[{"poster":"bloodmoth","date":"2015-02-17T08:20:30.288+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Ill explain my idea for W a little better by making it similar to his current one:\n\nCreeping death W: ACTIVE: Mordekaiser shrouds a target enemy and himself in a destructive cloud of metal shards for 6 seconds, dealing magic damage each second to nearby enemies other than the target within 250-range. magnetic energy grants mordekaiser a slight movespeed boost when running towards a foe under the effects of creeping death.\n\nUsing siphon of destruction will always pull the target afflicted by creeping death toward mordekaiser at double the power, regardless of position\n(*this could be tinkered around with*)\n\nI removed the bonus armor part to the ability as i really dont think mordekaiser needs more defensive buffs, if he does a better place to add that would be his passive, as its a more visible buff (*not a big fan of bonus mr/armor*) . Besides the movespeed i think is generally more useful.\n\nThe ability doesnt need to damage the target, it just needs to isolate them, that allows it to be a targeted ability, also since the ability double casts, you can still damage the target with the ability by standing near them which creates obvious counterplay and strategy.\nOf course, if mordekaiser is lacking offensive power and you want to keep the resist buffs, you could make the ability steal a portion of their resists, ie. lower theirs by a small amount and buff yours a small amount, so while the champ takes no damage, they are more susceptible.\n\nYour kit would fix some problems, but i feel like it would need to change the way hes played a bit too much. Id like to resist adding anything as strong as apprehend or blitzfist, for me E is still intended to be a spamable part of his rotation that constantly controls the fight and keeps foes near enough for him to mace. i dont like the idea of making it a narrow skillshot simply because i think he functions better with high aoe pressure, of course im not opposed to reworking its targeting area: slightly larger at the start, slightly more narrow than current at the end.\n\nOverall, i just dont want his power budget tied so heavily into raw offense and defense as they dont involve gameplay, rather id like to see more power invested into CC as the alternatives are mobility and range.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]}
