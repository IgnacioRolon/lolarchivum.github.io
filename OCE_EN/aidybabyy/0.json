So there&#039;s my justification for that.\r\n\r\nNow I&#039;ve looked through the boards and everyone seems to bag the idea of Aram ranked as &quot;random unfair teams&quot; are going to ruin the chances of skill being a part of climbing.\r\nWell.\r\nWith the recent addition of the {{summoner:32}}  spell, there&#039;s a possibility to make it a &quot;Balanced&quot; game mode, with something similar to this.\r\n\r\n**Tier Lists**\r\nEvery champ is assigned a _tier_ or a number of points, depending on their usefullness to an aram team. \r\nOf course something like this would be a lot of work to do, I&#039;m sure Riot could run an algorithm on win rates for champs and get some good data as a base.\r\nNow, the purpose of this, is that each team is randomly assigned the same number of points, be it 25 or 100 or 80, and the champions that they randomly receive all add up to that value (+-10, or whatever).\r\nIt would be along the lines of\r\n{{champion:268}}  - Top points\r\n{{champion:55}}  - IDK like, a billion points\r\n{{champion:79}}  - High points\r\n{{champion:77}} - Low Points\r\n{{champion:432}} - AFK points\r\n\r\nSo both teams could end up with trash, or both teams could end up with insane poke comps or one team could get a poke/disengage comp and the other team could get a couple of hard engages, where the skill difference between diamond and silver would be how well you understand your team comp, and how well you can play to the advantages, and disadvantages, of both teams.\r\nOf course each team would have a minute after champs are assigned to be able to see the enemy team, switch champs, and put on appropriate runes.\r\n\r\nBut yeah, honestly I think it could be great, but there are probably a thousand reasons why this couldn&#039;t work (definitely wouldn&#039;t in OCE because the player base is too small), but other than that limiting factor, thoughts?","replies":[{"poster":"Project Xayah","date":"2015-06-12T13:48:53.142+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"This has been suggested a million times and, for the millionth time, the worst thing you can do to a random based game mode is make it competitive.","replies":[{"poster":"Aluia","date":"2015-06-12T14:13:36.622+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Did you even read it all, about the tiered system and everything? That's just a example of ONE possible solution from one person. I'm sure if riot got a small team together to come up with ideas and solutions, they could, easily. Besides, it doesn't even have to be considered a 'competitive' competitive mode, it could just be a 'fun' competitive mode. Some people would enjoy having rank in ARAM, to feel like they've accomplished something in it for the time they put in; or even just having a goal (a rank) to work towards.","replies":[]}]}]}
