This fixes that problem. You still need blue because your mana hungry like crazy but other then that it is so much fun. Highly recommend trying this out :D Any other items you think would fit well feel free too comment :)","replies":[{"poster":"Garens Harem","date":"2015-01-23T03:29:58.327+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"hope they don't have {{champion:64}} \n\n\nhappened to me last time, it was a bad game","replies":[]},{"poster":"KingDinger","date":"2015-01-23T01:11:03.363+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"if your getting zzrot and warmogs, you need thornmail.\n\nfrozen heart is also good. because its on ENEMY hit lel. so sort of fits the theme of on hit.\nmore on hitness, BORK or nashors.\n\ndevo nashors wits frozenheart warmogs. once you start falling off, swap nashors for zzrot and boots for a thornmail and just tank it off.","replies":[{"poster":"Sethane","date":"2015-01-23T02:33:07.004+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I will try that next time I play Naut.
