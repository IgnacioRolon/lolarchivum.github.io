Few people pick it over the main carry mid the top who does whatever they want and the jg that no matter how well they do everyone blames them anyway. I am also a low elo player so if you gold or higher I doubt this would work. But lately when I call fill I have been stuck with adc. I have noticed lately that few people like playing adc and when they do they go hyper carries that if they do well they can win a game alone. Everyone else seems to not get played because assassins are the meta right now. Nothing worse then being an adc and when the enemy team engages on yours their zed ults you and your team leaves you to 1v1 built too kill adc's. So now when I play adc I play them VERY different too everyone else. Instead of {{summoner:14}} {{summoner:7}} {{summoner:21}}  I am now taking {{summoner:12}} . I have found the only way too be useful in your team is too ditch them and split push. See a tower with a minion wave attacking it. Tp in and take it. I have won games because of this tp idea. In every adc game I say too them lvl 1 I will not join team fights. You guys fight I will tear apart their base. So many times I hear them say we need you your our adc. No. The team doesn't actually need an adc. More often then not they have an ad bruiser that deals the same dps too a champ and doesn't get blown up by the enemy assassins. Anyway this is an idea that I highly recommend trying if you are finding team fighting with an adc is getting too annoying. Please feel free too advise me or others on what you may think of this. Rant over :)","replies":[{"poster":"Devil God King","date":"2015-01-29T11:53:03.552+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"maybe if you're playing a team setup of 5 romers","replies":[]},{"poster":"Acheron","date":"2015-01-28T07:47:37.307+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"it could work in a all or nothing attempt; i dont have the experience to say yay or nay to this but in my opinion (and i have done ADC quite allot as its my favored position) it could work if your team isnt communicating and both teams are on a stalemate without you being there then yes.\nas for{{summoner:12}} , i wouldnt recommend it bc i use {{summoner:21}}  and that has saved me from a assassin-gank insta-kill during the laning phase on more than one occasion. (for example im pushing them to turret and i get marked by zed so use barrier to completely nullify his ult so he has wasted it and we see him so mid or jungler can counter)  \nbut hey if it works for you good on ya.","replies":[]},{"poster":"BarryButcher","date":"2015-01-22T08:44:29.343+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"If this is your play style then why not simply take an ADC top lane? Its fine lots of people do it.\n\nVayne, Quinn, Corki, Ezreal and now Graves and Lucian are getting more solo lane play time.\n\nI agree with you. There are instances when you are in a game and no one knows what \"peel\" means, so you insta die in teamfights, so you think, well whats the point of me teamfighting if I just die instantly anyway.\n\nIf you insta die but your team cleans up, then keep doing it. Obviously there is an assassin or someone who uses all their cooldowns on you so that your team can kill them later.\nIf your team is losing the fights, then try to analyse why and explain how to win, or in some cases yes, split push. Tell the team never to group and ward up. Catch people in rotations. Its an effective strategy to never group sometimes. As long as you have the vision for it.\n\nStill wouldn't take TP though... Heal just gives you a lot more baiting/outplay potential.","replies":[{"poster":"Sethane","date":"2015-01-22T10:31:51.266+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The whole point is that I am stuck with bot lane.

Normally I don't start split pushing till after 20 mins and normally its top. On top of that I can't help the team I find. When ever I do the enemy team dives on me 'squishy adc' and Insta kills me or I escape on next too no health and too low too make a real difference. Hence the split pushing. Again this is just something I have found that works for me and I am offering this idea to others that maybe finding the same problem. :) thanks though for the constructive feed back.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"RNG Remilia","date":"2015-01-22T04:46:54.190+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Have fun while you can buddy cuz once you hit an elo where teams know how to deal with split pushing then your TP idea isn't gonna work.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Samurai Jin","date":"2015-01-22T03:55:33.848+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"No.","replies":[]}]}
