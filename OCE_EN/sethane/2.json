Only prerequisites is that you've played ranked before and know more then 1 lane, also that you have Skype. I am in bronze so this won't be any high levels of play. Feel free too add me on lol or just add me on Skype 'Sethane47' Thanks :D","replies":[{"poster":"skunken","date":"2015-02-07T10:11:13.734+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"id be interested in getting some games happening with you.\n\nIGN=Skunken","replies":[]},{"poster":"Virgin Nerd 4lyf","date":"2015-01-29T08:20:51.392+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'd be keen, I main jg, also play top/mid xD","replies":[]},{"poster":"Excaliburr","date":"2015-01-27T07:05:59.341+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"add Excaliburr","replies":[]},{"poster":"4ce Hunter","date":"2015-01-27T04:17:41.382+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"...","replies":[]},{"poster":"i dont troll","date":"2015-01-27T03:23:35.606+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I main mid lane and adc, with large champ pool.
