Money can = RP, RP does not = money.\n\nSecondly, you agree to the ToS and the EULA every time there is a patch, which includes all the legal jibber jabber, but to sum it up, Riot owns the account. You are essentially loaning it from them indefinitely. It's the same principle as renting a house, if you break the rules you'll be kicked out with no refund for the rent you have paid in the past, however much or little that might be.","replies":[{"poster":"Ticktic","date":"2016-11-25T05:56:36.339+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":2,"body":"no under australian consumer law once you PAY MONEY for a good or service it MUST be supplied there eula is worthless here","replies":[{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2016-11-25T06:07:25.917+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"The service has been supplied.

Again, once you've exchanged money for RP it loses it's monetary value and the service is supplied.\n\nYou do not own your account, Riot does, you only have access to it. To use the house analogy, you can't get kicked out of a house you own for something like noise complaints, you can only get fined/penalised, however if you rent a house and continually disturb neighbours and generally break rules the owner of the house has the right to kick you out.","replies":[{"poster":"Ticktic","date":"2016-11-25T06:11:25.749+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":2,"body":"but if i buy a skin to use and they forbid me to use said skin that infringes on the acl the eula was written for the USA and does not cover our acl as of january 2011","replies":[{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2016-11-25T06:18:24.247+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Again, the EULAs for NA and OCE are different.

As a part of the license you may acquire the license to use In-Game Assets [ToU IV.b]. Since you are licensing the content, there is no transfer of ownership.\nAs for the suspension and/or termination of the Account, if a person violates either the ToU, EULA, or Code of Conduct then Riot has the right to suspend, terminate and/or deletion the Account as per ToU III.e.1, EULA VIII,IX. However Riot also reserves the right to enact any of these options at anytime at their discretion with or without notice. You also have the right to terminate the Account either by discontinuing use of the Account or by contacting Riot. This is not an unfair term as per ACL s24.1 as it is reasonably necessary to protect the legitimate interest of the party who would be advantaged by the term. In this case Riot protecting the interests of itself and other users in the advent of someone breaching the ToU. EULA, or Code of Conduct. \nIf this was to be considered in court, the terms within the agreements are quite transparent and are keeping with the rest of the contract. \n\nSo in summary: You are only licensing content from Riot and have no ownership of the content. Riot's ability to terminate individual agreements between you and Riot is allowed by law as you are also extended the same ability, making it a fair term.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Project Xayah","date":"2016-11-25T06:59:16.876+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"To put it simply, unless you are purchasing the explicit right to not be banned the answer is no.
