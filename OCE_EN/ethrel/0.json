It's one and the same to them.\n\nAs a safeguard, you aren't banned if you only have one or two games in which you bomb out of. If it's more, then the system deems you purposefully leaving games and hence applies the penalty.\n\nIf you have enough evidence and a strong enough case, you can try pleading to support to lift your penalty, though I highly doubt they'll remove it for something like this. Your best option is to just play the five games and get it over and done with.","replies":[]}]}
