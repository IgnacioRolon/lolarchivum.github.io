Feelsbadman but the amount of toxicity I still run into in this game is insane it really is annoying because ranked games are just teammates fighting each other over the stupidest things.","replies":[{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2018-07-13T11:01:05.836+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"You pretty much get 1 semi-free dodge (6 minutes and -3lp for ranked) a day. If dodging was free or cheap no-one would ever get into a game, especially in ranked. Dodges are a strategic tool but Riot also have to prevent overuse and abuse of them to maintain queue and game health.","replies":[]},{"poster":"QAPLA","date":"2018-07-13T10:58:27.658+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I have this thing called \"other things in my life\".\nI can dodge and just play guitar or do something else for a while, it's called having a life.","replies":[]}]}
