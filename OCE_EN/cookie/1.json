Who am I and what credit do I have to back this up? I am a plat player in OCE (rusty due to uni work etc) and I was baited by a Inting Chinese person spamming SB all game, for the dumbest reasons ever (he constantly invades the enemy jungle trying to fight and dies when he loses 1v1). He continues to Spam SB, while taunting me. Eventually I end up flaming him, while still trying my best to win, and he feeds and flames our team. I end up getting suspended while the person inting walked away scot free. A way to solve issues like this (so it does not happen in the future seasons) is to region lock China. Why is region locking China a good thing? Well most games that region locked China stopped dealing with a ton of toxicity that comes from their massive player base. An example of a game that is doing very well is WoW, although WoW has region locked China due to cultural differences and what not, the game has never experienced huge toxicity issues like League and PUBG has. If you want proof of the huge Cesspool that is the toxicity leaking over from China in OCE, go to the OCE boards and type in &quot;Chinese&quot; You will find a lot of threads trying to discuss the problems going on. But to no avail, no real response asides from an old post from a rioter that is also fed up with these issues. I personally accept my suspension, it is wrong to swoop to someone&#039;s level like that. However what I am not fine with is that after all this time on OCE, this is still a prevalent issue. Reddit has proven, time and time again, that the only way to get a riot response to a real issue is to post it here instead of their boards.","replies":[{"poster":"Aneirin","date":"2018-06-13T01:19:42.438+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"> Reddit has proven, time and time again, that the only way to get a riot response to a real issue is to post it here instead of their boards.\n\nThen why did you post it here?

Do you have access to his account or something? \n\nI know you said it’s not a racist thread... but mate this is racist. You can’t say stuff like “Asians are so bad” then say “It’s not a racist comment.” Just cause you say it isn’t racist doesn’t mean it’s not and in this case quite racist. \n\nI don’t know if what you’re saying is true cause you have provided no proof what so ever except one personal experience which might not have even been from China.","replies":[{"poster":"Cookie","date":"2018-06-13T06:20:13.280+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"Its an extremely common occurrence in late night ranked games on OCE, there was a ton of complaining before, and there is evidence of this behaviour in other regions as well","replies":[{"poster":"SOOM","date":"2018-06-13T19:48:46.575+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Sorry can you link me to some posts complaining?","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Dr1bbles","date":"2018-06-16T22:38:36.894+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Even if the threads in question are made by silly people and ill-informed sometimes, this is a VERY REAL issue that needs to be addressed by Riot staff. The game in general is already competitive and fast paced, consistently allowing players who are Chinese to bypass the ToS through the language barrier is extremely stupid. What's EVEN more stupid, is that we have to rely on them actually typing something out to have them punished. What about griefing? Inting? I don't think I've ever once in my eight years of league successfully filed a report for griefing or inting and the Chinese players take FULL advantage of this to harass players and ruin games. How is it even an option if all you lazy Rioters even do is run a scan over chat logs and call it a day.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Ooftman","date":"2018-06-16T02:53:43.027+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"IM WITH YOU 100% GET RID OF THEM","replies":[]}]}
