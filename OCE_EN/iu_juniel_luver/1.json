I didn&#039;t report/submit ticket the first time because i didn&#039;t know how to.\nThis time i know so i write this to get help from you guys.\nstart of the game, my screen didn&#039;t spawn anything. It didnt spawn any allied or enemy champions including my own. \nThen, i restarted my computer, rejoined without an issue. We surrendered because another ally was AFK (3 v 2 til i reconnected back). No one reported me. I have been playing for until the game since reconnecting, but now im banned for some stupid reason. I want my account back to normal, now i have to wait 10 minutes for 5 games to get back to normal. It&#039;s really frustrating. I say Riot needs a system to idk... kinda detect their crashes... no uneeded afk bans (?) \nwhat do u guyus think?\n\nPS sry if i posted on wrong board. IDK what board i should've posted on haha...","replies":[{"poster":"Jaxxis","date":"2016-01-05T07:22:51.960+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You might think it's unfair but think about it, your teammates still had to play with an afk whether it was a crash or not.
