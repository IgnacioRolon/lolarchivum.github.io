It will never be over. Endless war has dawned upon Runeterra and I wasn&rsquo;t quite prepared for it. Sure, I signed up with the wolves to put an end to God king Garen&rsquo;s supreme order. But I never anticipated that this would be the result. This is too much for any person in Runeterra to bear, even a Noxian. God king Darius wasn&rsquo;t joking. When he said endless war, he meant it. Even now, Demacians rally the forces of Ionia, Piltover and Zaun to take down the God king. It&rsquo;s a complete blood bath. I pledged my allegiance to the wolves in the battle between wolves and lions. It doesn&rsquo;t mean that I still swear that allegiance now.\r\nI had to search for Riven, the dawnbringer was sure to know how to defeat the God. But when I arrived at what would be her temple, there was nothing but a ruined palace, and the ashes of soldiers. I&rsquo;ve been out of the fight for too long it seems. The nightbringer got to her first. The scent of fire and death polluted the winds that brushed past my face. Only sorrow was left here. Where do I go now? It seems hopeless. There&rsquo;s no light to quell the darkness now. That was when I heard the footsteps. A flicker of a flame. He had come for me.\r\n&ldquo;The road to ruin is layed out in front of you, whether you choose to follow it is your decision&rdquo;\r\n&ldquo;Why do you care? You should be revelling in the chaos. It&rsquo;s endless war, endless chaos. You of all people should be glad&rdquo; Death stared me in the face, but no fear was brought along with it. The nightbringer dashed towards me. I was ready to accept my fate&hellip;but fate had other plans. My eyes opened, and the blade was at my throat. Nothing stopped him from killing before, what changed?\r\n&ldquo;This isn&rsquo;t chaos, fool&rdquo; the blade was then withdrawn and sheathed &ldquo;Chaos is everyone turning against each other, senseless violence, killing for the sake of killing, nothing being spared. But this is not chaos. I failed in bringing her down&rdquo;\r\n&ldquo;Her?&rdquo;\r\n&ldquo;The dawnbringer. Her body may have been destroyed, but her presence is still here. The forces of Ionia and Piltover and all the others have united against Noxus. They have found order&rdquo;\r\n&ldquo;What does that mean?&rdquo;\r\n&ldquo;What do you think it means? Riven is still alive. Somehow, someway. This isn&rsquo;t how it was supposed to happen&rdquo;\r\n&ldquo;Maybe it is&hellip;&rdquo; The nightbringer turned to me with confusion. \r\n&ldquo;What&rsquo;s that supposed to mean?&rdquo;\r\n&ldquo;Chaos and order cannot exist without each other. Order without chaos is robotic. Everyone doing the same thing over and over just to make sure things go right. Nothing would progress because order brings inventions that are sparked from chaos&rdquo;\r\n&ldquo;It has always been like that, you&rsquo;re repeating old news&rdquo;\r\n&ldquo;However, if there is no order at all, then what is chaos? Chaos is described as disorder, things not going along with plans, things that happen that no one can control, something that is the opposite to order. But without order, chaos wouldn&rsquo;t be chaos anymore. It would just be&hellip;normal&rdquo;\r\n&ldquo;Cut to the chase, what does that all have to do with it?&rdquo;\r\n&ldquo;It means that try as you might, and deny all you want, you and Riven need each other. And right now, she&rsquo;s the only one that can fix this. She&rsquo;s the only one that can bring order for you to create chaos&rdquo; the nightbringer hand clutched the sword even tighter, realising the truth.\r\n&ldquo;Well how are we going to reach her then? We have no way of bringing her back, and quite frankly,  she won&rsquo;t listen to me&rdquo;\r\n&ldquo;Kill me&rdquo;\r\n&ldquo;What?&rdquo;\r\n&ldquo;Her plain of existence isn&rsquo;t in the real world anymore. One of us has to die to reach her, and we all know I can&rsquo;t kill you&rdquo;\r\n&ldquo;You got guts, I&rsquo;ll admit that. Are you sure you want to go through with this?&rdquo;\r\n&ldquo;Trust me&rdquo;\r\n&ldquo;Alright&rdquo; the nightbringer stepped in front of me making sure there was space for him to attack. With a nod from my head, he unleashes a tornado.\r\n&ldquo;Aseryo!&rdquo;","replies":[]}
