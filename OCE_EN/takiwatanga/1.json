It seemed impossible. Me, an enforcer of the law, teaming up with her, a psychotic criminal. The thought of that passed my mind many times. We both had different morals. Vastly different. Or so I thought.\r\nI was sent to the brink of Piltover to investigate a strange meteorite that crashed into the clock tower. I&rsquo;d have to admit it was odd, this has never happened in Piltover once before. But getting the chance to see a meteorite peaked my interests. It was a breather from all the time that we&rsquo;ve been searching for Jinx. That&rsquo;s another thing, the crime rate&rsquo;s been rather low since she disappeared. Not that it wasn&rsquo;t a good thing, but it is odd to say the least. Normally Caitlyn would be next to me, hunting the criminal together. But this time we&rsquo;ve split. I would&rsquo;ve let Cait take the job of finding the meteorite, then I would&rsquo;ve continued my search for Jinx, in fact I tried letting her. But she insisted I take this job.\r\n&ldquo;It would be a good break for you. Besides, I can&rsquo;t break into the thing like you can&rdquo;\r\nThat was the last I heard from her before I arrived at the site. Needless to say, I was amazed. The meteor was huge. What impressed me more was the fact that the clock tower was still functioning properly despite the damage. But then I see it. A sight that thoroughly disappointed me. A bunch of Piltovers officers standing around gawking at it. I would be too, except I actually want to keep the job. And surprise surprise, the one in charge of the group of idiotic officers is idiot incarnate Tyrian.\r\n&ldquo;What the hell are you guys doing?&rdquo; My voice cutting the silence that defiled the Piltover air &ldquo;You weren&rsquo;t sent here to stand and take pictures&rdquo;\r\n&ldquo;Well I mean we can&rsquo;t get close to it&rdquo; Tyrian, again, wasting his breathe on pointless speech. Same as usual.\r\n&ldquo;Get out of the way&rdquo; I pushed Tyrian to the side, making my way towards the meteor. Idiot. There wasn&rsquo;t any forcefield or government telling us to not approach it. Out of all the people the Piltover Police Department could&rsquo;ve sent, it just had to be nimrod and his knights of the stupid table. Bloody typical. Dust seeped into the sky as I slid down the slope of the crater. Maybe I can break a piece off for Caitlyn to analyse. It&rsquo;s not like I can trust anyone else to do it. They&rsquo;re all pretty much idiots anyway. I rear back my left hand for a punch. I&rsquo;m gonna make this thing crumble. My fist makes contact with the meteorite. And then I see them. The visions. Visions of creatures seething through a rift into Piltover. Creatures of darkness and pure evil. Then I see a beam of light vaporise the monsters. Several people adorning bright colours fight off the monsters. Then one looks back at me. I recognise the face. Jinx? What&rsquo;s she doing here?\r\n&ldquo;Wake up fat hands&rdquo; She calls out.\r\n&ldquo;Huh?&rdquo; I respond, confused about what&rsquo;s happening.\r\n&ldquo;Wake up!&rdquo; Caitlyn&rsquo;s voice startles me and I wake up holding my head. My eyes check the surroundings. There was no meteorite. It&rsquo;s disappeared, and the clock towers restored to normal.\r\n&ldquo;You alright?&rdquo; Caitlyn asks. Not wanting to concern her, I nodded. \r\n&ldquo;Maybe head back home, you clearly need to rest&rdquo;\r\nOn the drive home, several things clouded my mind. I couldn&rsquo;t get the visions out.\r\n&ldquo;What happened to the meteorite? What were those visions?&rdquo; I spoke out loud trying to work my head around what just happened.\r\n&ldquo;I can explain what&rsquo;s happening&rdquo; The voice startles me. I put my foot on the brakes and almost swerve off the road.\r\n&ldquo;The hell are you doing in my car?!!&rdquo; I turn around to find one of the people from my visions. The one who fired the beam.\r\n&ldquo;I can explain that too-&ldquo;\r\n&ldquo;GET OUT!&rdquo;\r\n&ldquo;I know this is new to you, but-&ldquo;\r\n&ldquo;I SAID GET OUT&rdquo; \r\n&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve been chosen.&rdquo; There was silence which plague the air of Piltover. I&rsquo;ve had enough at this point. I open the door and hop out of the car. I start walking.\r\n&ldquo;The star guardians need you&rdquo; her voice echoed through the night. I ignored her. Star guardians, these visions. I wouldn&rsquo;t have another word of it. I walked for several hours. I reach the top of a hill exhausted. There&rsquo;s a park bench nearby. I decide to sit on it and think. \r\n&ldquo;Hey fat hands&rdquo; Her voice startling me. There she was. The loose cannon. Adorned in white with a star adorned on her chest. &ldquo;Do you like mint chocolate chip, or vanilla?&rdquo; I didn&rsquo;t think it was possible, but I felt relieved it was her. \r\n&ldquo;Mint&rdquo; I reply, mostly due to short of breath.\r\n&ldquo;Sorry bout lux&rdquo; she replied, handing me the dripping cone of ice cream &ldquo;She doesn&rsquo;t understand what&rsquo;s going on.&rdquo;\r\n&ldquo;What do you mean?&rdquo; I reply more confused.\r\n&ldquo;Strange meteorite crashes, you go to investigate, you get visions, then all of a sudden a goody-two-shoes is like &ldquo;Hey, you&rsquo;re a star guardian&rdquo; like your just gonna accept it.&rdquo; I chuckled at the statement. It was so accurate.\r\n&ldquo;So, what do you plan to do? Are you gonna try and convince me to become one?&rdquo;\r\n&ldquo;Me? Nah, I just came to eat the ice cream. But I suppose I could tell you the perks. Perks like having heaps of awesome toys to play with! Oh, and saving the world is cool too I guess&rdquo;\r\n&ldquo;Saving?&rdquo; I stood up at this statement &ldquo;You&rsquo;re saving the world?&rdquo;\r\n&ldquo;I know, right? It&rsquo;s weird. But you can only do this if you truly accept being a star guardian, but hey I won&rsquo;t rush ya. I was in the same boat&rdquo;\r\n&ldquo;What changed your mind&rdquo;\r\n&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know, something I guess. But I understand it takes time. So, I&rsquo;ll leave you to it.&rdquo; She stood up and walked away.\r\n&ldquo;Oh, by the way&rdquo; she yells over her shoulder &ldquo;nice clothes.&rdquo; I barely noticed before she said that. My clothes were white adorned with stars. The same with my gauntlets. After I took all this in, I walked back to my car and drove home, which, funny enough, was at the foot of the hill.\r\nAnd what happened afterwards? Well I eventually accepted the role as a star guardian, and fighting next to jinx again feels like old times. It&rsquo;s nostalgic, and it feels good. \r\nThe stars are now protected by an iron fist.","replies":[{"poster":"LevvyLeviticus","date":"2017-09-01T10:07:10.035+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"but vi isnt getting a star guardian skin... right?","replies":[{"poster":"Talon12","date":"2017-09-01T15:03:44.387+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"not as far as anyone knows","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Talon12","date":"2017-09-01T15:04:46.720+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The star guardian universe has a different lore to the actual game, Jinx isn't a criminal, she is just a stubborn school girl...
