I know there are certain links to get you the page, but that required you to log in on a NA Server. There is no option for a Oceania Server or at least I haven&#039;t found it yet.\r\n\r\nIf you could tell me how to unlock the skin while staying on a Oceania account that would be great. Also if you have not figured out a way or have had no luck, please share this information with the rest of us who may be curious. That would be great.","replies":[{"poster":"Project Xayah","date":"2015-05-21T11:48:02.880+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Just send a ticket to support.
