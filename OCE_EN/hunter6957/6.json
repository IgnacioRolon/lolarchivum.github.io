If you just have any tips you&#039;d like to share please do, but I can imagine I already know what I should be doing it&#039;s just putting that into practice and getting better at it (e.g. farming, map awareness, engaging, etc).","replies":[{"poster":"Nightjar","date":"2018-10-19T10:39:25.995+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"when you transition to adc it becomes harder to be good at the things you used to be good at as support. Map awareness and positioning becomes alot harder when you have to focus on csing. Don't let this tilt you, it's a learning experience (you may also want to ask your support to deep ward).\n\nAlso you may want to start with caster adcs. Lucian, MF or Sivir, are a good way to transition from mage type supports to the adc role, don't just try to learn vayne as your first adc. It won't work.","replies":[{"poster":"Hunter6957","date":"2018-10-20T11:49:18.577+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Sweet, I don't plan on maining any particular ADC so I'll make sure to spread out and try a few things. Thanks for the input.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"DarkShade918","date":"2018-10-20T00:42:56.660+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"TIp 1. Don't play adc\nTip 2. Don't blame your support if you're the one making mistakes\nTip 3. Don't whine when you get 1 hit by enemy assassin, you were the silly person who picked adc\nTip 4. Learn to last hit\nTip 5. Learn Target Focusing (ie, don't hit the fucking tank when a squishy is closer)\nTip 6. Learn wave control (freezing/pushing/shoving/slow pushes/etc.)","replies":[{"poster":"Hunter6957","date":"2018-10-20T11:48:33.033+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Other than who to focus in teamfights, I'm pretty sure I've improved and can do all of those fairly consistently. The only issue I have with fights are I want to hit the backline, but they're too far back so I focus the frontline because I think that's all I can do. Other than that, I'm good. Thanks for your advice, especially your first point :)","replies":[{"poster":"Nightjar","date":"2018-10-21T01:45:15.282+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"As an adc, you generally want to be focusing any low targets within your range, whilst kiting out enemies and lockdown as much as possible, possibly focusing down an assassin every once in a while. You aren't supposed to be dueling their adc or backline in a teamfight, and if you are, you might be standing a little too far forward. \n\nSo many adcs are caught up in the 'we need to focus down x champion' mentality, but adcs aren't really burst champions, it's not their job, and so you generally aim for either low targets within your range, shredding down an advancing bruiser or kiting out to survive and keep doing dps.\n\nAs an adc your job is damage. Surviving for long enough to do that damage, and controlling how you spread that is one of the most decisive factors to teamfighting.\n\nThe number of teamfights that are lost because an adc spreads their damage across too many targets, are too innumerable to count.","replies":[]}]}]}]}
