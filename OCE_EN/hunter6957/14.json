After a bit of thinking and talking with a few of my friends, we came to an idea of a 6 v 6 game mode. How it would work would be very simple.\r\n\r\nIt works in a very similar way to Summoner&#039;s Rift. There are three lanes, each with two towers per lane, one inhibitor tower, one inhibitor then the nexus in the base. Champions would be divided into each of the 6 Champion Roles in League of Legends (Assassin, Fighter, Mage, Tank, Marksman and Support) and each lane is a 2 v 2.\r\n\r\nFor example:\r\nOne lane could have a tank and an assassin\r\nOne lane could have a marksman and a support, very similar to normal bot lane\r\nAnd finally one lane could have a fighter and a mage\r\n\r\nAlso, to really set this gamemode apart from Summoner&#039;s Rift, it could be played on the old Magma Chamber map. Of course these wouldn&#039;t be set roles but I&#039;d just like to hear everyone&#039;s thoughts on the idea so let me know what you think.","replies":[]}
