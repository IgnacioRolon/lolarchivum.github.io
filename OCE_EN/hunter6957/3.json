However, if you go onto a summoner profile and into the item sets section, the black market brawler items are still optional to put into builds. This includes Mercenaries, Upgrades and Game mode specific items.\r\n\r\nI was wondering if it was possible to remove the Black Market items so that it isn&#039;t so confusing what items are and aren&#039;t currently available.\r\n\r\nThanks","replies":[{"poster":"GigaPube","date":"2015-09-03T19:03:26.554+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"probably couldve just said \"please remove game mode items from item sets kthx\"","replies":[]},{"poster":"Big Boi Bite","date":"2015-09-03T12:08:39.687+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"items sets? who uses items sets!","replies":[]}]}
