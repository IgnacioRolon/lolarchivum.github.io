I&#039;ve been mainly playing Tristana Bot but haven&#039;t been able to do anything in games, let alone carry. When I first started losing games it didn&#039;t bother me as much but now even small things like missing a canon can immediately put me in the wrong mindset. I&#039;m just wondering what advice everyone has to deal with tilt and staying in the right mindset during game.","replies":[{"poster":"lordsky","date":"2018-11-12T01:15:07.149+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Uninstall and come back in a few days","replies":[]},{"poster":"DarkShade918","date":"2018-11-05T02:08:37.798+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"1. Don't play trist, she's a shit adc right now, try jhin or varus, they're relatively easy, and do more damage than trist\n2. Take deep breaths when you feel tilt setting in\n3. Don't blame your support if you're the one that's shit\n4. Listen to music, personally metal, rock, hard rock keep me going even after my team ints\n5. Go out for smoko, ie. take a long break, food, shower, glass of water, walk, whatever. just leave the computer for a while\n6. if you feel that its just shit teams over and over, take a few days break, then come back, it might not change, but you won't be tilted, since you'll have probably forgotten\n7. make sure you don't play when hungry, tired, or angry/sad, play it when your mood is right, and your head's in the right place\n8. DO NOT TILT YOUR TEAMATES, IF YOU'RE THE ONE THAT'S TITLTED\n\nIf all goes to plan, you'll be untilted for as long as necessary, the minute you fell it come back, just stop, leave the screen for a while\n\nDuoing/5 manning in a troll comp (in norms obviously) will help too, since you're playing to fuck around, and have fun, it will untilt you pretty quickly\n\nFinally, if there are players abusing you or whatever, write their names down on a piece of paper, and if you see them again, just dodge, a cheetah can't change its spots.\n\n{{sticker:slayer-jinx-catface}}","replies":[]},{"poster":"SamoanHunter","date":"2018-11-05T01:31:30.796+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Easy:\n\n1 - Go watch something on youtube, or a TV series or even a movie.\n2 - Go out for a walk.\n3 - Smoke (If you don't want to then obviously avoid this)\n4 - Play a norms with mates\n5 - (In Game) Listen to your own music, if you aren't doing so already\n\nAnd if push comes to shove. Mute all.

Breathing doesn't do shit, because it reminds you of the literal fact that you are tilted in the first place. unless you breathe before a game to refresh your thought process. drink cold water. that really helps. always play with water, and refresh your mindset before every game. have fun. and focus > tilt.","replies":[{"poster":"Hunter6957","date":"2018-11-03T21:30:10.703+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"That's actually some really good advice.
