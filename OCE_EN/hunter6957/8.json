At the moment, I have 17829 IP (I have every champion, including the newly released {{champion:136}}), so, when Hextech Crafting came out, I got the free chest, a skin and a ward, and I can&#039;t find out if I can do anything with the excessive amount of IP that I have.  If there is anything I can do, please let me know.\n\nIt doesn&#039;t impact me that much, I&#039;m just curious. Thanks","replies":[{"poster":"GigaPube","date":"2016-03-25T08:47:26.091+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"thats not much IP worthy to complain about. even after just buying a. sol (lel) you'd have had over 25k IP. not much to be complain/brag-worthy\n\nyou can buy more runes. 20 pages with all of them having flat armour and MR? i dunno how you've seem to have gone through a good deal of time to arrange your pages so thoroughly without changing over half your runes. i know that they're the most popular and have the highest....\"useful variance\", of runes in the game, but 20 pages worth is overkill. 3 various marks but one of them is flat health? and MARKS too? come on man i know you can do better than that\n\ni reckon you should get armour pen marks, scaling health seals and 6 flat+3 scaling CDR glyphs (5+5=10 total CDR). those are your safest bet for expanding and capitalising on your raw stats game. i love the setup you've got going though, so neat and organised\n\nto be more specific, if you're playing zyra support and you build void staff and full AP in general, you can consider a stronger late game with 3/6/9 scaling MR glyphs, or 4 flat+5 scaling MR glyphs or vice versa, 2 flat+1 scaling CDR quint (5+5=10 total CDR), an armour and 2 scaling CDR quints for 10 CDR. for a safer laning phase you can get movespeed quints or armour marks","replies":[{"poster":"Hunter6957","date":"2016-03-27T07:10:39.120+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yes I know that my runes are pretty bad and that I should expand with the runes no the rune pages, good point and I know I should also create specific rune pages for champions, but I'm not too worried about that, I was just wondering about what I can do in Hextech Crafting, that's all.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Ethiorius","date":"2016-03-24T22:01:57.888+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"***","replies":[{"poster":"ItsxEriic","date":"2016-03-24T22:33:54.133+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"so how it works is that you can re-roll a skin that you don't want as long as you put that skin and 2 others. That will make it so that you will re-roll and permanently unlock that random skin. And the difference between the orange and blue essence is that the blue essence is champ essence that you can get only from disenchanting champion shards while orange essence is cosmetic that you can get only from disenchanting skin shards. Each essence can be used respectively to unlock a champion(blue) or a skin(orange).","replies":[{"poster":"Maraudaur","date":"2016-03-24T22:52:08.314+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Just to add to this, full info here - http://oce.leagueoflegends.com/en/site/2016-season-update/champion-mastery.html","replies":[]}]}]}]}
