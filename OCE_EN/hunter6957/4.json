Personally, I think the skin and concept around it is just awesome on so many levels.","replies":[{"poster":"ShuffledPancake","date":"2015-05-26T08:18:30.431+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I was meaning to say it would be a bad version of khaleesi, mainly bcz she sucks until she gets bigg-er dragons lel(If swain was her it would be better but they wont do it)","replies":[]},{"poster":"ShuffledPancake","date":"2015-05-26T07:07:47.048+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"But his r would be mini peasant dragons lol","replies":[{"poster":"Hunter6957","date":"2015-05-26T08:01:03.742+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Pretty much. In fact a lot of Swain's abilities use birds.\n\n(Know his abilities for the second part)\nHis Q would probably have a little Dragon creating a teather (chain) of fire probably. His W could have a dragon raise a claw to grab whoever is in the AoE. His E could be a fireball or something. His R like you said before would just be awesome, a massive dragon (who I hope would look awesome) just with little dragons flying to his opponents.\n\nThe potential for this idea is just limitless.","replies":[]}]}]}
