This way we could have all the gold and experience we would need to go straight to Lv. 18 and full build. Unfortunately, we discovered that you can&#039;t invite friends onto the practice tool.\r\n\r\nSo, I&#039;m just wondering if there are any plans for the future that I&#039;ve missed allowing players to invite their friends or if it will be a new change in the near future. I&#039;d be really interested in hearing your thoughts and opinions about this topic.
