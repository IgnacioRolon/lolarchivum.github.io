The particles look great, the way he looks his sound , his abilities, all of it. I think Riot&#039;s done a really good job with the skin. However, there is just one slight thing that really confuses me. In the models of Thresh I&#039;ve seen, his head just seems to be really far from his body and it just looks off. Anyway, just wondering if Riot&#039;s planning on fixing it.\r\n\r\n[](https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-03K41pG8Mj8/W3OQiVmQqaI/AAAAAAABFk4/ODA04kW40oUJGXIuLA4H_98F8YycbX2XwCLcBGAs/s1600/thresh.jpg)\r\n\r\n[](https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-T6biSL5Htto/W3OQjMvszcI/AAAAAAABFlM/3ygE6S4ZW90XjQcpZLXcsr5PfLSNjEhswCLcBGAs/s1600/threshturn.jpg)","replies":[]}
