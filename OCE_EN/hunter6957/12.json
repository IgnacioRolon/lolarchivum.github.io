It was really frustrating to deal with and essentially impossible to play with. So with no choice I had to restart my computer, reconnect, I joined the game and we won. I was really disappointed to learn that if you leave a game, even if you reconnect you will be ineligible for any points of promotion in League. I&#039;m sure this has happened to hundreds, if not thousands of League of Legends players in my scenario, so I just want to hear your thoughts on the opinion.\r\n\r\nThank you.","replies":[{"poster":"Hunter6957","date":"2017-11-19T10:48:27.053+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'd love to hear what some Riot employees have to say about this issue.
