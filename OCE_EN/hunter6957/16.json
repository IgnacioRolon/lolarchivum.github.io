In the Lunar Revel, I got the same skins (I did not purchase them previously). This is kind of frustrating, getting the same skin twice, so I&#039;m wondering if this has happened to anyone else and if Riot can give an explanation on why and if they can do anything about it. Thanks for reading.","replies":[]}
