I was thinking of something along the lines of a player&#039;s MMR could be checked 3-4 times a year within a certain time period, or at least spend a reasonable amount of IP/RP to be able to check.\r\n\r\nFor me, I don&#039;t see climbing divisions as a real form of improvement as I could reach Gold 5, lose or troll 9 games in a row and sit there happy with my rank but with an MMR of someone at Silver 1 bordering on Silver 2, assuming a loss of 20 LP on average. I know my level isn&#039;t exactly very high either or else I would be in a higher division myself, but I would really like to see our MMR be checkable as a true form of improvement, and not just go off the rank we&#039;re at. An example of this would be a Gold 5 player getting matched in a Silver 4 game (which has happened before) and this player went off saying something along the lines of &quot;you guys are all trash etc.&quot;. I clearly remember this example because we lost the game and this player still proceeded to trash talk even afterwards. It obviously didn&#039;t occur to this player that they were matched with us because this player&#039;s MMR was most probably at our level, which was Silver 4. Unfortunately, a lot of these players appeared near the end of the season, and if this player was getting matched with us and **still** eligible for getting rewards for attaining &quot;Gold 5 with the MMR of a Silver 4&quot; I find it quite unfair to say the least. I also used to use a lot of lolking back then (Season 4-5) so I know he was solo queued. What infuriates me the most is that players like this one complain &quot;I don&#039;t understand why I can get matched with such bad players&quot;. Well duh, if we&#039;re bad, you&#039;re at our level which is bad too. And if you&#039;re this bad, you shouldn&#039;t be eligible for rewards for achieving  Gold the proceeding to troll the next 9 games because &quot;I can&#039;t drop anyway, I&#039;ve got 10 games of immunity&quot;.\r\n\r\nI&#039;ve been here since Season 2, so I&#039;ve read through the reasoning for removing visibility our MMR in the first place, but when people can go onto lolking or lolnexus to see that you&#039;re in your promos, you&#039;d be literally at the mercy of any troll that wants to ruin your chances of climbing. During any promo game, it feels like you&#039;re constantly walking on eggshells to try not to make **anyone** mad so that you have the highest chances of winning, and this creates ranked anxiety since this is very easily abused. Based on the current system, players would have their division-drop immunity removed the moment they win even one game, and that also adds to ranked anxiety.\r\n\r\nDivisions also mask the true ability of a player and whether they truly deserve their division or not. I get that divisions were introduced to give players a milestone to look forward to, but based on the reasons I detailed above, I just feel that having Divisions as an indicator of player skill is psychologically unhealthy for both personal improvement and ranked queues.\r\n\r\nHowever, I can&#039;t constantly give negative criticism without suggesting an alternative. In saying that, I&#039;d like to suggest that instead of having only 7 defining divisions (Bronze, Silver, Gold, Plat ,Diamond, Master, Challenger) and LP gains or losses, our progress would be visible through the use of in-between numbers. The idea behind this is to camouflage our MMR into the current LP gain/loss system we currently have, effectively merging the old ELO system and the current League system. An example of this would be that if the range of Silver 3 was 1200~1300 and Gold 5 was 1600~1700, we&#039;d be **Silver 3 (27)** at 1227 MMR, and **Gold 5 (92)** at 1692 MMR.\r\n\r\nThank you for reading.","replies":[]}
