As of late, I&#039;ve been hit with a lot of blue screens while in the middle of games, and as a result have been put into low priority queue due to &quot;leaving too many games&quot; when it was completely unintentional. I am not a fan of leaving games at all as I know it ruins the game for everyone. Because of this, I&#039;m wondering if anyone who knows a thing or two about programs and software can help me identify what&#039;s causing my Blue screens.\r\n\r\nA little background, I also play on Garena, where this particular problem had first started. I&#039;d be in the middle of any game, even a Ranked game, and I&#039;d be hit with a &quot;Driver IRLQ not Less or Equal - L1C63x64.sys&quot; BSOD. Initially, I thought it was a Garena-related issue and left it at that, making sure to rejoin the game afterwards, but majority of the time, we would&#039;ve lost any sort of advantage and would either be breaking even or even losing by the time I&#039;d got back in. This is the first time I&#039;ve had it happen while playing on the OCE server, and I&#039;m starting to feel concerned as I don&#039;t want to get permanently banned because of something I could&#039;ve prevented.\r\n\r\nMy initial diagnosis was that it could&#039;ve been due to one of my VPN programs, Pulse Secure, that I use when I go to Uni for classes, so in between games I&#039;d try to ensure that the program wasn&#039;t running as it had a habit of starting up in the background. I was under the impression that it might be somehow interfering with my internet connection, and so I&#039;d ensure that Pulse was always off or I&#039;d open task manager and end task manually. Fast forward 5 months, and a BSOD hit last night even when Pulse was off. Because of this, I&#039;m starting to think it may be because of Discord. I&#039;ve noticed that a lot of my BSODs have occurred when I&#039;m in Voice Chat with my friend while we&#039;re playing together. Last night, when I was in game, I hadn&#039;t been in voice chat but I do know that Discord was open in the background.\r\n\r\nI was wondering if I could have some help shedding light on this issue, and helping me check error logs, if there&#039;s anything of the sort that can be looked at to identify the problem and eliminate it permanently.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance, I&#039;d appreciate any help.","replies":[{"poster":"st0rmbreak X","date":"2017-12-06T09:52:57.269+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAND it happened again.
