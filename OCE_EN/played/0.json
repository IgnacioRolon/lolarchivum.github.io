The lag is strictly limited to League as my ping on teamspeak and several speed tests say its 40, my upload and download speed is fine as well, Youtube videos load smoothly and so do streams so i do not see any reason for this lag, 180 constant makes it unplayable.","replies":[{"poster":"SephirothSG","date":"2016-10-02T01:56:40.038+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey there,\n\nCould you do the following for me;\n\n* [Download WinMTR](https://sourceforge.net/projects/winmtr/files/WinMTR-v092.zip/download) and run a traceroute to the following IP.
