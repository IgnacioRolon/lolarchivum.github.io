Mastery 6 requires getting atleast a S- two times and **500 blue essence**. Similarly Mastery 7 requires getting atleast a S three times and **600 blue essence**. This new mastery system had only been out for less than/around a year before Riot told us about the Preseason and blue essence changes. \r\n\r\nThis may not sound like a lot but considering that existing blue essence is multiplied by 6.5 in the new season this adds up pretty quickly. I have only 3 champions mastery 7 and 3 champions mastery 6. To get 6 champions to level 6, **500*6= 3000** blue essence. To get 3 of those champions to mastery 7, **600*3 = 1800** blue essence. A total of 4800 blue essence spent. Converted into the new system, **4800*6.5 = 31200** blue essence. Subtracting the cost of mastery level in the new season: **31200-4800 = 26400**.\r\nEffectively meaning that by hopping on the new changes with the mastery system within a year, I have **&quot;lost&quot; 26400 blue essence** which I could spend on the exclusive blue essence shop. \r\n\r\nI understand the partial discount for runes and rune pages as they have existed for basically the lifetime of league but the mastery thing is pretty new and is being completely neglected. \r\n\r\n**Will we get a refund? Will the cost of mastery also get multiplied by 6.5?** \r\n\r\n{{sticker:zombie-brand-mindblown}} \r\n\r\nBTW: Pretty hyped for the new runes! More to pre-game than just stacking stats now.","replies":[{"poster":"Haaosa","date":"2017-11-06T14:52:54.300+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Cost also increased\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/7am4d5/champion_mastery_lvl_67_pbe/","replies":[]}]}
