Here&#039;s the kicker, they perma banned his account, had his first ticket auto redacted and his second ticket(for recovering his account) was deleted.  \r\nAs far as I can tell, his account was banned as a precaution in case the breach of his account was still there, but why has his first ticket been auto redacted with no response and why was his 2nd ticket deleted?  \r\n  \r\nI dont know what to do for him, because what else can he do? he clearly cant rely on Riot Support if they are just gonna delete his tickets and RiotSupport twitter doesnt respond either, do I have to take this to reddit?","replies":[{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2017-04-19T11:44:06.523+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"In such a case usually they would direct you to the account team by way of asking you to submit a new ticket selecting the account recovery option. They will then go through the steps to prove ownership of the account then make sure everything is sorted. Typically the response to the first ticket would be somethign along those lines.\n\nIf he created a second one under the wrong category then it's possible that they might well close the ticket but usually they would redirect him again with a response before doing so.\n\nIs he submitting an account recovery ticket? If not that's what he should be doing. Either way, if you pass me the ticket numbers I might be able to look into it some more for you.","replies":[{"poster":"KesslerCOIL","date":"2017-04-19T16:37:42.588+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"He submitted a recovery ticket and it was deleted the next day, still not sure why.  \nHe provided as much info on his account as possible, so I'm not sure why it would have been deleted(or if it has), when he clicks to look at the ticket from his email it shows up with an error page saying the ticket is no longer there.","replies":[{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2017-04-19T18:09:27.021+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"They don't delete tickets util they get to a certain age after being closed (it's quite a while, a year I think?). If a player is spamming support they may reach a point where they will close tickets with no response, but they don't delete them. I would say it's likely that it's an error somewhere along the way that is making him unable to see the ticket, but he should still receive responses via email (and be able to respond via email).\n\nTo clarify, he submitted the account recovery ticket, did he receive anything back from that? Also, could you give me the ticket number and I'll chase down someone who can take a look and see what might have happened.","replies":[{"poster":"KesslerCOIL","date":"2017-04-20T02:01:27.220+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It's fine now I think, I think the ticket was just hidden or something?

This way, the tickets are dealt with via email only and not through the Support Portal. These tickets are redacted so as to prevent hackers from obtaining sensitive account information that would cause further issues with recovering accounts. If your boyfriend has already submitted an Account Recovery ticket while logged out, just have him wait on a response. If there's no response within 48 hours, let me know the ticket number and I can double check to ensure that everything is running smoothly.","replies":[]}]}
