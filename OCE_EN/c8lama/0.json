We get patches and new champs/skins a day before everyone else.\nand it also means we likely started this season, 1 day before everyone else, so it really wouldn't have been fair if we had more days than other servers.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Twenty Six","date":"2017-11-07T12:56:02.227+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"the information has been on the league of legends client home page for well over a month.\nyou cant be angry at riot for giving you all the information you need at your finger tips and not bothering to check\n\nbut i am sorry to hear that you missed your goals, that would be frustrating.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Dr Twinkletits","date":"2017-11-07T11:05:30.671+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"There's people saying it ends at midnight tonight.

It seems that every server has had their ranked season end on the 7th (today) in their respective time-zone, despite all the information Riot giving us about the season ending on the 8th (tomorrow).\n\nI'll agree, it's stupid of Riot to be telling the entirety of the community the one date leading up to the end of the season, then change it to the day before with no notice whatsoever. Not to mention, last season also ended on the 8th of November, which would make people further think this season would too (especially being told it would).","replies":[]}]}
