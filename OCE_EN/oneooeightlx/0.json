After graduating highschool i enrolled in university it was a place far away from my friends so i hardly ever saw them in fact i never saw them as long i attended that university. I was very close with my friends and they were the same to me we trusted each other i thought i would never ever lose them but that was where i wrong.Before this started we would always play some ranked 5&#039;s but now that has become a distant memory My friends went to the same university so i was the one alone.. we had eachothers phone numbers my first week of uni my phone didnt ring once from my friends 2 weeks, nothing 3 weeks, nothing i thought i was alone and i was. When the third week arrived i decided to call them up, personally im not the type to initiate a conversation it was a bit part on my end we talked and we arranged a day to meet up after so long it was fun, i havent seen them since highschool. But after that day i thought they would remember how fun it was being together and they would call me up its been 4 weeks after that day silence. I decided even though we dont get in touch i would always message/call them i kept it up for a while but realised they never messaged me i felt betrayed. So i stopped. It wasnt until my friend suggested to go signup for facebook, ( i hated facebook in my opinion) so this was a big step. i joined there chat group where they made all the arrangements to meet up with eachother, everyone but me, i felt a hole in my heart that they would see eachother without me i havent experienced sadness or depression for a long time. On facebook i gave them a message saying something along the lines of&quot; hey guys long time no see&quot; silence.. not even a hey how are you just silence i couldnt believe i got left behind. The sad part was even though i did message they still made plans to go out, not even inviting to me. I was so depressed when my relatives would come over and invite me out i drowned my sorry on league of legends and hardly got out, So i thought its okay i have less than 1 month until i graduated my course after that i can transfer to the same uni as them, in which i did but it wasnt as i expected. One day when i went to the same uni as them they walked past me with no realisation it was me saw that they made new friends and moved on without me. I was left behind, alone and depressed and still am i had no friends and still have none i actually entered a void where i had lost everything i once cherished for the first time in my life im alone.","replies":[{"poster":"DragonOfTheVoid","date":"2015-10-31T15:07:01.619+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":4,"body":"***","replies":[{"poster":"A NaCl n Battery","date":"2015-11-01T04:58:18.390+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Cmon man, if you don't care then don't comment, he's clearly distressed that he's lost some long term friends, and that's normal to feel that way, so a comment like that is just unnecessary. And also, if you understood what he was saying you would realise that he's not looking for mates on here, he's alone and needs somewhere to post his thoughts/someone to talk to, I think most, if not all people have felt that way before.","replies":[{"poster":"IMainTower","date":"2015-11-02T07:38:04.982+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"He must be Bronze","replies":[]},{"poster":"DragonOfTheVoid","date":"2015-11-01T07:16:58.310+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"nar","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"nononotorious","date":"2015-11-01T06:05:13.615+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"prat.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Bipolar","date":"2015-11-01T12:13:00.862+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":">they made new friends and moved on without me.\n\nDo the goddamn same thing, make new friends and get over it, stop whining about losing friends.

All three of these dudes are going separate ways and although they may find it sad that things have moved on and never will be the same, they find the courage to let go of the past. im sure it was plenty fun and youll miss it forever, but honestly, no big loss. youre graduating, youll get a job, youll find mates there and youll meet tonnes of new people throughout your life that you can create new memories with.\n\nsomtimes, it's a lot more trivial than that, of course.i had a bunch of mates that went completely ham on another mate back in the day because he spent too much time with his girlfriend. bloody ridiculous, eh? i was overseas at the time, but when i got back, i saw that he'd been left out for so long that he had just moved on. i dont see him too often, but that's because he's moved onto better people and things. but can you imagine how the idiots who lost a good friend because they couldnt rein in some stupid-arse jealously issues feel now, as mature adults? theyd feel like absolute retards. winner? the one who got left and moved on.\n\n\"gg life. ive just lost all my friends\", that's a quitter's line. if they dont want to hang out with you, so be it. go find some more friends. if you transferred unis just to be with them, dayam, youre a mate everybody needs. when they mature and they come to the realisation that you, as a mate, worked your arse off just to transfer so you could be with them, they will probably wonder why in the hell they let such a friend go.\n\nhard as it may be, get in there and be like, \"hey, why the fuck are you ignoring me? i just did all this so it could be like the old days.\" if they give you the cold shoulder, gtfo son. hope youre mature enough to see that it's their loss and not yours if they fob you off.","replies":[]},{"poster":"bollockz","date":"2015-10-31T20:43:17.793+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"No worries dude. Keep your head up, a real 'friend' would never forget you. Realise that those people were never worth your invested time, learning who to invest time in will take... time.
