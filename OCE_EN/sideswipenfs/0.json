I feel like the nerfs hit him really hard and almost made him weaker than before his rework. But he still seemed ok, once you got some early jungle items he does really well clearing and his shrines make invading the emey jungle all good so in that was he is still strong. unfortunately he can't really just run into the back of a team fight and rip apart the adc like he used to do because you need to build dmg for that and without the HP and resistances from the tank items you just get blown up and if you go tanky then your pretty much no use until late late game... of course things change from game to game but my best tactic for him is to get some move speed and just afk farm until your ult is up and then go gank a lane really easily and go back to farming and invading and making the enemy cry until late game where you can just go and never die in team fights and grab the adc or anyone who jumps on yours and pretty much its a good time. is all up: probably not the best option .. but far from the worst with a bit of practice and trying out different styles to see what one works for you the best :)","replies":[]},{"poster":"ViolinMaker53","date":"2015-12-17T09:10:06.774+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"beastial","replies":[]}]}
