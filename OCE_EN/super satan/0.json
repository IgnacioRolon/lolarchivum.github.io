Wind queen janna feels like the same as normal janna being the wind queen type, Gragas is always drunk but they could change hi to be looking a bit more drunk or suited to being in a pub drunk, with the jax one i can see wghere you are coming from but with jaximus and so on it seems that has been the main idea with him being mighty but there is some potentional if it goes towards a different style. but all the others seem like great ideas.
