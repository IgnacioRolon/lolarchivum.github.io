I am considering trieing to hang myself for a third time. I need know suicidehelpline etc. but they dont help. They dont know my story. I trust GD league more than any of my &quot;friends&quot; who i really only hang around so that i dont look like a loner. I am posting this from this acc so i dont get any spam on my main. I have dreams of playing league professionaly but my parents dont trust it/me and think it is not going to happen. I have a account in Master but doubt i would get challenger with limitations and restrictions that i have because of parents view of this as a waste of time. I have numerous times been told that i should forget it or do something else but i dont have anything else. I suck at school obv have 0 social skills and am done with being alone in this world. sry about bothering GD but i promised my someone i would talk to someone and this is the best way that i feel i can talk.","replies":[{"poster":"Tomblade","date":"2015-08-28T01:08:28.531+0000","up_votes":16,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey OP, I've added your account in-game.

I've been around a lot of people who are in a similar situation to you. Lots, my partner included.\n\nEveryone is going to tell you things will change, they don't really just change though. It takes effort, you will have to put in work. For some people happiness is just simple, they're the lucky ones I guess. Most of us however have to work at it, there most likely not be some life changing moment that changes everything no single clarifying moment. It will be a slow process of learning to accept that which you cannot change and working through the things you can.\n\nPsychologist help, but they're not mechanics. They don't just lift up the hood and change a few things to get you working again, even with them a lot of it is on you to improve but they do help you to understand your emotions and often have good advice to help you see it while it's happening. \n\nAnother note I'd like to add, I know you haven't mentioned a partner or gf or anything, but I want to stress how important it is that doesn't change anything. Getting in a relationship shouldn't bring you happiness, you should bring your happiness to the relationship.

Your friends might actually care for you more than you think, especially if they know you feel this way. My friends have always been there for me and I once felt the same way you did but they were there for me throughout the whole period.
