It made the game basically unplayable, with all commands taking way too long to actually go through, and I tried everything; restarted my computer, modem, etc. I know it&#039;s only League of Legends because after restarting everything, Dad downloaded a gig of data in a couple of minutes, and I loaded up youtube to test it out and it works fine, but then I went into a custom game to test it out and the ping was worse-500-900 ping. Is anybody else experiencing this? Does anybody have any clue how I can fix this? It&#039;s seriously ridiculous and incredibly frustrating, because it literally stops me from playing.","replies":[{"poster":"kitarosan","date":"2015-09-24T06:02:35.713+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"yeah.. my ping was 40ms before server move to east. then it was 70ms after server moved.
