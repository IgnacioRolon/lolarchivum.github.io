Do I agree it should be done? Yes I do. I&#039;m here to try and get people to join in, but before you jump on me about it and get angry, just take a moment to listen to why I&#039;m so pissed off at Riot for doing this.\r\n\r\nWe&#039;re getting the shitty end of the bargain. Other servers got their server skin for free, why shouldn&#039;t we get ours? On top of that they got more than one, so the excuse that Riot already gave us a free skin is invalid.\r\n\r\n&quot;But it&#039;s for charity!&quot; I hear you cry. Yes. I would also pay for Pulsefire Ezreal if it were going to charity. But this? This is supposed to be the skin that says &quot;I&#039;m in OCE!&quot;, not the skin that says &quot;I gave money to charity because I have money to burn on a game!&quot;. It&#039;s a glorified excuse, and nothing more. Riot is just hiding behind a righteous facade, and I don&#039;t like it. I support the charity, but not all the money will go to it. Remember, you will pay for an amount of RP, but only a portion of that amount will be donated to the charity (proportional to the amount of RP paid for the skin). In the end we&#039;re getting ripped off, and they&#039;re going to profit from it overall.\r\n\r\nIf they make this skin free, I&#039;d gladly buy another skin, even if it is more expensive, to give to charity. But no, that&#039;s not how it is. Sorry Riot, I&#039;m not take this scam.\r\n\r\nhttp://boards.oce.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/miscellaneous/50FixXhb-boycotting-cosmic-reaver-kassadin","replies":[{"poster":"dead nig","date":"2015-10-18T11:00:20.622+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":3,"body":"***","replies":[{"poster":"Billos","date":"2015-10-18T13:52:19.122+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"What a well reasoned and sensible response.
