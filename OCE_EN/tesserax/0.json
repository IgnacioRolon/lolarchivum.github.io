Now that would be fine, except not once has my jungler actually jungled properly. The system always forces me out of jungle and gives me a jungle who runs around, ignores objectives, often feeds, and doesn&#039;t do anything to contribute to victory or the team or trying to actually win the game, almost as if they&#039;re a bot programmed to intentionally throw or they&#039;re trying to purposely tank their ranking by throwing games.\r\n\r\nNow I won&#039;t say I&#039;m a perfect jungler that always does well, but I don&#039;t get how in my matches where I&#039;m autofilled out of the jungle position my junglers aren&#039;t even able to perform at the same level as anybody else in the game. Top will be winning, bot will be winning, but then the jungler&#039;s walking around, not farming, not teamfighting, runs some random path through the jungle, and then recalls without having done anything, wasting so much time by doing so.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, I don&#039;t get how when I duo with my friend, at least one of us gets autofilled every three games, and both of us get autofilled together every five or so games. Why can&#039;t we have the option to avoid autofill and simply endure longer times? I&#039;m tired of losing games because not only can I not play my position, but the person who autofilled into my position apparently is unable to play either.\r\n\r\nMe and my partner have constantly been forced into frustrating situations because of this, as if our teams being such heavy baggage most of the time wasn&#039;t enough. So please, can we have some way to just disable autofill and give us some kind of lower priority or something? I don&#039;t care how long I have to wait if it means that we have a better chance of actually winning games. Plus, lots of the games I go into we see have 2-3 people autofilled, some of which are autofilled INTO JUNGLE even though I have jungle set as my primary and I&#039;m forced to adc anyway.","replies":[{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2017-02-14T16:48:00.161+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I don't have time to answer every point, but the one thing that immediately comes to mind is that, Jungle is a very versatile role. Whatever play style you have it'll fit into Jng somehow. Sometimes sure, they're just plain playing badly but, it's best to try and keep an open mind and remember that just because someone doesn't play a role how you would, doesn't mean they are playing it wrong.\n\nIt's something I have to constantly remind myself of when I get mid instead of supp. I'll be watching the supp and wondering what in the name of all that is holy they are doing, but more often than not, anything negative I'm seeing in their play is a result of my bias to the way I play support, rather than them actually doing anything wrong. (Though if you take my support because you aren't comfortable in mid and then don't build a damn Sightstone I'm not going to be very happy with you).","replies":[{"poster":"Tesserax","date":"2017-02-20T06:48:37.338+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"The issue I'm having is not with playstyle, but the fact that all of it tends to amount to nothing. I'm fine when junglers farm all game, IF it means they are able to carry. But leaving your team to 4v5 for the entirety of the game without doing anything, or dying when you try, is not cool, and really confuses me as to how these people expect to win. One example was a Sejuani jungle I had on my team once: she farmed the whole game, ignored objectives, intentionally went to the opposite side of the map from the epic monster being taken (top while drag was being contested, bot while baron was), and entirely refused to help the team in any way, shape, or form, despite 2/3 lanes actually having won. We lost simply because we literally didn't have a jungler to play with, just a very oversized minion which roamed around killing jungle monsters. The number of times similar games occur, or games where the jungler is unable to actually perform ANY function of the jungle role, during autofill has been simply outrageous, and I'm wondering if it's just me and my mate's bad luck with autofill.\n\nTo put it into perspective for a mid/supp player which I'm assuming you are, imagine a support who roamed the whole game, refused to ward, refused to peel, refused to actually do anything to contribute to the team, and simply walked around, farmed, and avoided fights. Or a mid laner who sits in mid the whole game, freezes lane constantly, doesn't push lane, doesn't roam, doesn't even try to win lane, and simply starts farming jungle once people gank him or try to contest objectives with him.\n\nObviously the Sejuani scenario seems very much like sabotage, like she was trying to intentionally lose the game, but there are far too many similar games where the people seem to expect to BE carried without ANY input of their own, and simply refuse to help the team, refuse to listen to anything you say, refuse to ward, fight, contest drags, push towers, etc. It's just frustrating seeing these people play like they don't even want to win, like I mean this is ranked, go to normals if you don't want to try","replies":[]},{"poster":"Gesteppie","date":"2017-02-14T22:42:20.781+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I've had SOOOOOOOOOOOOOO many people rage at me because I don't buy sightstone XD\nLike seriously, it's NOT a compulsory item.","replies":[{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2017-02-15T09:15:37.206+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I have to vehemently disagree.\n\nIF your jungler is building trackers and they don't have a picking kinda team comp then MAYBE I would be okay with not having a SS on the team. But outside of those circumstances, the yellow trinkets just aren't sufficient for good vision. Vision is so very important, and it's something that people underestimate a lot. \n\nStrictly speaking no item is ever compulsory, however mainstream, but SS is a very important item.","replies":[{"poster":"DipperOCE","date":"2017-02-15T13:02:31.307+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"It's entirely situational. If you are winning and able to be making these plays as say braum or thresh, wards are very important in the enemy jungle and dragon so you can have vision to further push your advantage. If you are behind, you need to keep drag, the river and your buffs warded. Sight-stone isn't always necessary if mid is roaming bot on your team, as play is focused around that area. Vision is definitely important, but if you are trying to play a safe lane you will rarely need more than 1 control ward and your trinket, as you aren't looking for opportunities to kill the enemy jungler or steal stuff, and you aren't going for super deep engages. If you play safe and assume the worst of every situation, the lack of extended vision isn't that big of a deal. Some support items can offer early advantages letting your team and your adc snowball, but to confirm your lead you want to be domination.\n\nVision is directly connected to map pressure. It is useless to have vision where your team can't go, because you can't do anything with it. Say you are winning a game bot side heavily, and mid takes tower. This not only lets him roam as his wave will now naturally push, but also opens up the freedom in bot lane and the enemies bot side jungle. If you keep wards in their bot side jg and drag you are only going to increase your lead. But if you are behind in the same scenario, you can't afford to be going for those kinds of picks. You need to place protective wards around your jg and bushes which could lead to jumps or ganks. This is all about where the enemy is. \n\nThere are definitely certain lanes where it doesn't matter where the enemy is, leading to the decision to skip SS, because until mid-late game (more late game) vision isn't the N1 priority. Sightstone is such a cheap item, and no other item really does anything like it, so we can't really compare it to anything. But for 800 gold even in these situations I definitely recommend getting it third at LEAST. (as in if you can't get it first or second, you still need it).\n\nIn high ELO and pro play, situations are more defined and rely on the details, so having correct information about positions and knowledge of where they will be, becomes very desirable. This is why low elo players care less about sightstone. It's not because they are low elo and bad, it's because it holds significantly less value there. Even with that information, they could know little how to use it. But it doesn't matter.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Gesteppie","date":"2017-02-19T22:19:36.954+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Perhaps then if there were other useful items that gave the SS active. I know there are the combo support/vision items, but I put priority of the active over the vision, especially early game. If you got something that can double slow, or shield, or massively speed up your teammates, winning OR losing i believe that's a much greater benefit than just seeing where the bad guys are.\n9 times out of 10, if i go against a support who has built SS first, and I've got the active first, the active outweighs the small amount of hp the support has given themselves, because no matter which active I've got, I can spend more time pounding into them AND it benefits my ADC.\nSure ruby SS is worth it, but maybe it's just my play style that doesn't fit the early SS.","replies":[{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2017-02-22T11:41:52.449+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"A late SS isn't the same as no SS. Oftentimes in lane i'll make the choice to upgrade to Frostfang before completing SS, usually if my lane is dominant, because as you say, the stats give you superior kill potential. Rarely will I build the Eye items, I pretty much stick with blue SS and the active item for almost every game. \n\nThat said, I still feel that SS is a valuable item that should be in every game somewhere, even if it isn't built first.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]}
