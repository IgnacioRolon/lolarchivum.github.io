My ping will be fine, hovering around the usual 20-30ms, and everything else in the game around me will be going fine, but for some reason everything I do is stuck and I can&#039;t do anything; no typing, no moving, no smiting or flashing, my game basically just freezes for me while everybody else around me does their thing. It&#039;s particularly frustrating when it happens mid-fight, and I know it&#039;s not my connection because my browser&#039;s still working fine, so wtf is happening over on the server side?\r\n\r\nApart from that, I just hit level 40 and was &quot;awarded&quot; a glorious champion capsule, except upon loading up my loot inventory, it&#039;s not there. What&#039;s up with that?","replies":[]}
