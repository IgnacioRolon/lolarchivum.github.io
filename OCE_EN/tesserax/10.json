However, I looked at the screenshot and I don't see anything of the sort. This [honor faq](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/115008474148-Honor-FAQ) does go through what honor is, how to earn it, and how you lose it. I would take a look at that and see if this answers your questions. My guess is that it's slower to gain honor since the season is still new or you may have had a punishment this season and you're earning your honor again.","replies":[]}]}
