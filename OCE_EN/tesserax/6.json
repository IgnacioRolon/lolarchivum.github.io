However, tonight it reached a climax that I cannot forgive, and I have to ask what the HELL is going on? There is no sign of a live maintenance, nor is there ANY post at all suggesting that people are experiencing disruptions, and that riot is trying to fix it. This is extremely infuriating, when I am perfectly connected to the internet, yet for some strange reason continuously disconnect, over and over and over again. Tonight I was playing a Kassadin game, and why did I lose? Well I happened to disconnect after stomping my lane, giving the enemy Syndra a free kill, and then disconnect again doing the same thing, and then roam bot to gank, disconnect briefly before getting a kill, and then disconnecting in the middle of enemy territory immediately, to die to Syndra yet again. These stupid disruptions continued for the rest of the game, eventually costing us the win as the enemy team had gone too far ahead, and I had lost approximately over 10 minutes of extremely valuable game time (due to the deaths caused by the disconnects, as well as the disconnects themselves). I was still able to do well, but my opponents benefited extremely heavily from it, and as a result they won. This game is supposed to be fun, but when you are faced with not the challenge of your opponent, but the RISK of disconnecting because the GAME ITSELF can't run properly, it enrages me, because I have no control over what happens, it's 100% up to luck, whether the servers decide to let you stay connected or not. I find that whenever this happens, the game becomes unplayable and EXTREMELY dissatisfying to play","replies":[{"poster":"HORSE OF FORCE","date":"2015-02-11T23:28:25.329+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":">Well I happened to disconnect after stomping my lane, giving the enemy Syndra a free kill\n\nIf that happened, that means the Syndra isn't lagging.

Also, why make all those points about being unable to carry a game? That's completely unrelated to identifying the lag and only serves to boost his ego.","replies":[]}]}]}]}
