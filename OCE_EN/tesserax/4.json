If you want the explanation, and to actually try and argue against my opinion, then you'll have to probably read the rest of the post in order to understand why I think my suggestion would work. Enjoy.\n\nNow I&#039;m going to put it plainly. I don&#039;t like that both my rank and MMR can be determined by 4 other players on my team whom I have no control over. While I am ranking up and there are game that I am able to play and control, there are some games where I just feel completely out of control as my teams or single players refuse to cooperate or make idiotic decisions that single-handedly lose games, such as raging and AFKing because I didn&#039;t gank him enough, or one Yasuo who was just so bad that he went 1-15-6 and lost us the game despite the rest of the team working together as hard as we could to shut down the enemy Anivia who had spiralled out of control. Up until the 15 minute mark or so we were up in kills, dragons, and towers, yet a single player who fed kills was able to undo all of the teamwork and objectives we had built.\n\nAnyway, I propose an idea. MMR is intrinsically linked to the games you play, and your wins and losses, not your individual abilities. But what if your MMR was related instead to a similar system to mastery? Generally if you do really well in a game, you do the most damage, take the most damage yet have the least deaths, you do everything amazingly you&#039;ll get an S+. If you play pretty well, clearly better than the rest of the players but still make some mistakes, you get maybe an A-. If you play clearly sub-par you get a D. Why can&#039;t they base the MMR system on a similar thing? It would make sense. By all means base actual LP and rank on games won and lost, but MMR can be scaled with individual performance. Allow me to explain:\n\n1) I play incredibly well, I win lane, I push towers, I work with my team and secure multiple objectives, ending the game 16-5-9. However, one person on my team was an asshole, deciding to rage and eventually AFK because our jungler didn&#039;t gank, or nobody helped when he dived the entire enemy team under their nexus towers while we were low. One person&#039;s stupid decision brought the rest of the team down and we lose for it, okay. But the rest of the team&#039;s MMR went up because we played well and his goes down because he played badly.\n2) The next game, me and my teammates are all matched against better players as our MMR would suggest. We have a harder time, but learn from out mistakes against these tougher opponents and improve. If we win this game, because our MMR is greater than our rank, we get more LP which compensates for the previous loss.\n3) The other play who played badly goes down in both rank and MMR. He plays the next game, and wins this time, but he plays equally as badly. So, as a result his MMR goes down, and he&#039;s matched against with players with a similar skill-level as him, as opposed to being crushed by one player and being carried by his team. This offers him to actually earn his ranks as he is now matched against players with a skill level more similar to his than in the previous games, though now he&#039;s earning less LP per win as his MMR is low compared to his rank.\n\nSo what does this mean overall? It means that good players who aim to improve will be allowed to do so, being paired against players who are better offering them the ability to learn from a more difficult environment. You cannot improve by winning every easy game, you will learn nothing from making no mistakes. In addition, now that their MMR is higher than their actual rank, they will gain more LP to compensate and their rank will quickly climb to better match their MMR and actual ability, and lose less LP due to each loss.\n\nOn the other hand, a bad player who doesn&#039;t care or focuses more on winning games than improving, raging and being toxic will drop in MMR. As a result, wins will be less beneficial to him as he will be earning less LP per win due to his significantly lower MMR. Simultaneously, he will also lose more LP per loss, as if his rank is Silver III but his MMR dictates he should be in Bronze V and he&#039;s playing against Bronze V players but losing despite being ranked Silver III, his LP will drop significantly to correct his rank to correctly match his MMR (because that&#039;s what basically happens anyway, but as Rank and MMR are currently calculated almost exactly the same it doesn&#039;t happen).\n\nThis would be perhaps a more balanced system, allowing players to better settle into their correct elo, while also focusing on the idea of self-improvement to win games and rank up, as opposed to &quot;I had a bad team therefore I lose&quot;, which actually happens from time to time.\n\nNow I&#039;m not saying that all my losses are due to bad teammates, but many of them are. Looking through my recent match history (over the past month or so), the majority of my games I have done well in, yet I have lost almost as many games as I have won, which does not reflect my individual performance. Basically, the system that I am suggesting would help to match rank better to individual performance.\n\nNote: When I say individual performance, I mean not only your mechanical ability or ability to win lane, but your ability to coordinate and work with a team. Players who have a bad mechanical ability will drop in MMR. Players who cannot coordinate and work with a team will drop in LP. \n\nFor example, a player who is unable to play well but can coordinate with a team will drop in MMR and be matched against players more equally skilled. As he continues to improve, his ability to work with a team will come out and he will begin to climb.\n\nA player who can play well but cannot coordinate with his team will lose games, but climb in MMR and improve. As his MMR climbs, he is matched against better players who are able to do both things better than him, and will cease to climb once his MMR matches his skill, but his lack of ability to work with his team limits his ability to actually win games, and despite having a greater reward for winning and a lesser punishment for losing, he will drop as teamwork is essential to winning games, and he will lose more games than he wins until he actually improves this aspect.\n\nFinally, a player who is able to do both will simply climb. He may lose a game or two due to teammates refusing to cooperate or simply playing badly, but his MMR will climb due to his performance. As his MMR climbs, he is matched both with and against players who are better at the game. Due to his ability to work with a team, he will perform better than another player who cannot, and he will continue to win more games than he loses. As a result, his MMR will climb and his Rank will soon climb to correctly reflect his individual ability to play and work with his team.\n\nObviously this is just a suggestion, and Rito will probably never read this. But I want to see feedback from people and what they think. Not just &quot;Lol this is stupid and sucks,&quot; but actual constructive criticism as to the nature of this suggestion. What are the flaws I have overlooked? Perhaps there is something I can or could clarify or explain better? Maybe there is a better way to go about it? Maybe somebody disagrees that there is a change needed, and if so please put a valid reason rather than just &quot;There is no problem with the system now&quot; and just saying nothing else, that&#039;s a claim that does not help or do anything.\n\nI know it&#039;s a long post with a lot of ranting, so here&#039;s a TL;DR\n\nMake MMR based on personal ability just like the Mastery system is based on, while allowing LP to remain based on wins or losses. This will better see players reaching their potential and improving than the current system of &quot;If you win you go up, if you lose you go down,&quot; as the current system judges a player based on his entire team&#039;s performance rather than his own, and cannot correctly reflect how good an individual player is and give him the appropriate rank.","replies":[]}
