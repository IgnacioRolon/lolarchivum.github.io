I&#039;ve lost at least 30 LP and an hour of my life because this bug throws you out of champ select. What you&#039;re seeing on the screenshot is me in champion select looking at that same screen, which clearly says 0 seconds, for about 2 minutes before it kicks me out of champion select, causing a dodge. It happens way too often, one in every 20 or so champ selects; either you can&#039;t ban, you can&#039;t pick, or you&#039;re lucky enough to have already done both, or you&#039;re last pick and everybody else takes long enough to pick that you manage to catch back up. I have no clue what causes this bug, all I know is that this has been happening since last year and it still hasn&#039;t been fixed.","replies":[{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2018-03-28T00:36:29.873+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"1.
