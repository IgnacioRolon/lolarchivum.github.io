Once. Why did this occur? Does it also apply to dodging games? Why do you have an automated system in place which fails to work properly?\r\n\r\nIf dodging games is also &quot;problematic&quot; then why can&#039;t we have a system which allows the team to vote to dodge, or a pre-game report system which allows us to report the pre-game chat (which I believe is currently unrecorded) and dodge the game? Obviously false reporters will be punished, but it&#039;s such an easy system to put in place and monitor, you just need a few guys (or player-based tribunal (wink wink, nudge nudge)) going through chat logs and scanning for people saying &quot;I&#039;m going to feed,&quot; or just generally being toxic.\r\n\r\nIn general, can we actually just get a real report system? I play with plenty of people who are toxic or actually boosted and report them, but I&#039;ve only ONCE received confirmation of their punishment, which tells me either toxic players are slipping through your automated system or you simply don&#039;t consider them toxic.\r\n\r\nA player by the name of Dong Huap made a video detailing how your system picks up on target words. TARGET WORDS. According to him, if I say &quot;Draven, would you kindly end your disgusting, worthless existence,&quot; I won&#039;t be picked up on the system because I didn&#039;t say &quot;Go kill yourself&quot; in the traditional manner. This is a huge problem. Hell, we saw with Dunkey&#039;s exit from the game that the system in fact favours intentional feeders and trolls who are able to act like they&#039;re really trying their best, but in fact aren&#039;t. Honestly, I&#039;d be a large sum that if I was given a diamond ranked account, I could demote it to bronze V in 30 days by intentionally trying to lose games and still not get suspended or banned. A lot of players are able to get away with feeding and trolling by acting innocent, I&#039;ve seen it firsthand, they even try to play victim and blame you for flaming them even if they&#039;re the ones that flame, but I never get confirmation or feedback of their punishment.\r\n\r\nI don&#039;t know if you&#039;re working on this, or how the system works, but please, we need a better system. Automated systems NEVER cut it in this case. You wouldn&#039;t trust the entire justice system on a computer, so why would you trust this with one? We need a tribunal back, even if you guys are running it, even if there&#039;s some kind of specific system which selects certain individuals who are considered non-toxic to be judges.","replies":[{"poster":"Ing√©nue","date":"2017-06-07T04:16:21.784+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It is possible to be punished for just one leave, and this usually triggers when you leave a ranked game (you failed to connect in your kha game 4 days ago) or when you don't have many games played.
