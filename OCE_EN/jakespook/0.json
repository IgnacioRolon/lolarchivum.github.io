And ive been thinking about a few changes to make her more viable!\n\nObviously we dont increase her \ndamage :') \n\nBut what about adding a speed boost to her moonfall (her e) that\n increases with the more champions hit by it? Gives her a little more utility/escape mechanics without making her broken!\n\nOr alllowing her r to target freindly units and/or wards? This would be hard to balance but would give her the escape mechanism to allow her to fit as an assassin(which she is played as so often) or possibly a top laner split pusher ect..  maybe compensate by putting a larger cd on her r when used on friendly unit or something! Maybe allow her q to apply moonlight to wards and friendly units as well?? \n\nJust think diana needs some more utility or mobilty for escaping! Probably one or the other!","replies":[{"poster":"Wuks","date":"2016-06-30T02:42:57.993+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Here are Meddler's thoughts on Diana's current state:\n> [{quoted}](name=Meddler,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=zXf6FiAF,comment-id=0000,timestamp=2015-01-14T08:28:12.292+0000)\n>\n> My current thoughts/couple of general comments:\n> \n> Akali - Lot of fun and a good alignment between her kit and theme, Lacks sufficient counterplay, resulting in frustrating playing against experience especially when she&#x27;s ahead. Removal of the mitigation stats from her W&#x27;s reduced her dueling power against tankier champs which is a positive, squishy targets still struggle with a lack of options sometimes however. The live balance team&#x27;s currently experimenting with her ult range to see if reducing that&#x27;s an appropriate lever to put her into a better spot (her having high reliability&#x27;s less of an issue if it&#x27;s more practical to stay out of her zone of threat or at least force her to use another ult charge before getting to you).\n> \n> Diana - Would benefit from being more clearly an assassin or a fighter, rather than a generalized mixture of the two (a good fit for her personality that unfortunately results in her being hard to give sufficiently clear strengths and weaknesses when strong enough to be picked). In an ok state, would probably require that work be done to get her to what you&#x27;d call a really good state/be a character we felt was good for the game if a really common pick. Not currently being worked on. \n> \n> Both of them - Bit much overlap between the two, both utilizing a similar combat approach through their ults, Q&#x27;s and cleaves. Ensuring the two of them end up with a few more points of distinction would do both some good (which personally suggests Diana should be pushed towards being more of a fighter, though I can see the argument for assassin as well).\n\nhttp://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/gameplay-balance/zXf6FiAF-meddler-one-of-these-days-youll-come-to-my-thread-my-kingdom-my-sanctuary?comment=0000","replies":[{"poster":"jakespook","date":"2016-06-30T12:05:50.471+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thanks for posting this!

Riot want Diana to be someone who jumps in and stays in the fight until the end.
