(Support main)","subforum":"Gameplay & Strategy","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hello, I am a support main (one-trick Nami) contemplating on learning ADC. I enjoy being a support and think it&#039;s super fun, however, recent circumstances with a friend made me want to learn the ADC role. I know how Caitlyn and MF work because I&#039;ve tried them out in practice tool and a few draft games but I really want to do better.\r\n\r\nThe ADCs that I have in my collection are the following: Ashe, Caitlyn, Jinx, Twitch, Tristana, Kai&#039;sa, Varus, Vayne, Sivir, Kalista, and MF. Some I bought because I want I to learn them, some I got from loot. \r\n\r\nAnyway, yeah, if you guys have any tips for me as to who I should try practicing first, please let me know! The way I learn best is practicing a champ until I reach mastery 6 on them (weird but, hehe). Any general and/or specific regarding transitioning from support to ADC will be very much appreciated. \r\n\r\nThank you and have a good day!\r\n\r\nYours,\r\nBuncha","replies":[{"poster":"Socon","date":"2018-03-19T16:19:31.268+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"You can take MF all the way to plat and then start dabbling with other adcs so i would suggest MF for sure. Caitlyn is good but to play her effectively you need insane trap micro. Kalista never works out if you're not familiar with your support. Ashe can be good but her damage output is sub-par. Twitch is a very solid choice but is immobile, positioning is key. Tristana got nerfed pretty bad so i dont suggest playing her. Kai'sa is underrated atm, you can learn her but she might get nerfed/buffed soon since shes new and riots still figuring out how to balance her. Sivir is only good against caster adcs (ez,cait,lucian, etc.), therfore she is a unique counterpick champ and isn't worth learning until you start maining adc for awhile. Vayne is a no no. Varus can be a good adc to pick up but riot may be nerfing rage blade so its not a good time to learn him.  Jinx is a solid adc to learn and i doubt she'll be seeing any changes soon, shes not weak but shes also not op, depends on the game really.  \n\nMaintaining perfect cs while making good trades is key to playing adc in lane. If you can't cs well then i would suggest focusing on that before worrying about anything else.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2018-03-15T01:00:23.166+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"My very limited advice (because I'm still complete trash at ADC myself) is to start with a champion that's easy to farm with. I dunno about you but as a support main my CS skills....leave a lot to be desired, so picking up someone like Jinx for ADC who is easier to farm with (in her case because of att speed) was a big help at getting started.\n\nCaitlyn is also a pretty safe bet all around. She's got the safety range, the big hits to help with farming (though low att speed) and overall isn't too complex. Sivir is also someone I played a lot cause it's easy to push with her, but that comes with it's own disadvantages as well.\n\nI'd recommend staying away from mechanically intensive champs like Vayne/Kai'sa (unless you're going into normals with the expectation of losing lane and it's just for fun/experience) until you really get a handle on the role. They can be super strong for sure (called hyper carries for a reason) but they're very high skill cap (long time to learn and master). It would be like playing Azir or Aurelion as your first ever mid laner, you'll be floundering very quickly.","replies":[{"poster":"bunchanana","date":"2018-03-15T04:55:07.330+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hello, thank you so much for your response, I really appreciate it!\n\nI really have a lot of trouble with cs-ing. Like I've tried going mid lane as Lux and Orianna but my cs always falls between 48 - 52 in 10 minutes with 65 max as my best. I never got the timing right with last hitting and sometimes I get frustrated with myself. My friend suggested that I play Caitlyn because he said that it's very easy farming with her. She's the first marksman that I've tried in a draft game but I still struggle with cs-ing even though I practiced a lot in custom/practice tool. \n\nDo you have any tips about cs-ing with Caitlyn?\n\nI enjoy her too because I feel safe with her, however, just the thought of being out-farmed is a big yikes for me since people have been telling that I need to farm more than the enemy if I want to get better. :({{sticker:sg-soraka}} \n\nAnyway, I really appreciate your help with this! I will do my best to learn Caitlyn and Jinx's kit very well.\n\nEnjoy your games and I wish you the best!","replies":[{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2018-03-15T11:26:41.603+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I mean if you really want to get better at cs the best thing you can do is jump into practice mode, since you can isolate just cs and don't have to worry about all the other stuff like positioning and trading while you get your timing down. In actual games though, it's really just a matter of experience. The more you play it (and the more you focus on it) the better you'll get at it.\n\nIf you can duo with a support friendo it'll be a little easier since they'll know what's going  on and protect you to play passive in the early game so you can focus more on farming.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Essembie","date":"2018-03-15T01:03:28.772+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"its weird I always sucked at vayne but I am really enjoying kai'sa","replies":[{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2018-03-15T01:08:27.173+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I've only played with her so far but I enjoy playing with her more than Vayne too tbh. I'm not sure  if it's just because it's fresh/new/exciting, but if I had to take a guess it's because she feels more versatile. With Vayne lanes there often isn't much poke going on. It's either a decent length trade or an all in which means she's both less equipped to play from behind, and is leaving all of that to the support, while that isn't so much the case with Kai'sa. So far as I can tell Kai'sa has better tools to engage off a support's catch than Vayne does as well.\n\nBut then, sometimes a champion just clicks. I regretted buying Anivia for the longest time back in the early days because I couldn't play her for the life of me. Tried her again a year later and now she's one of my fav champs. Not to mention the first time I played Nami on free to play rotation I loved her so much I main her to this day :P And Rek'sai was how I finally got into and started to understand jungle.","replies":[]}]}]}]}
