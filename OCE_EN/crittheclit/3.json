False reports should be pretty much debunked and thrown away by the system, whether it's done via automated or manual review. That said, the system isn't perfect so it can happen that the automated system (even a manual review) might trigger an unwarranted punishment, in which case your best bet would be to appeal by submitting a ticket to [Support](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us).\n\nI'm a bit unclear on the details of what's up-to-date information, but false reports will either be treated as \"irrelevant\" and thrown away (no \"backlash\" on the person doing the reporting) *or* it's still under the old system where each player (rather, account) has a \"general report weight\" which is positively or negatively influenced by accurate and false reports, respectively.\n\nAs ThatsBS has already mentioned, there is a \"no name-and-shame\" policy on the boards, so keep that in mind for the future. It's best just to abide by it, not just to avoid \"witch-hunting\" on players but also to avoid unnecessary boards-bans on your account (beside, there are other places you can give out their names where Riot can't do anything, if you really want).\n\nEDIT: OMG, did one of those people actually say \"Yahoo it\" as if that's a thing?\n\nThat's f*cking hilarious!\n\n{{sticker:sg-miss-fortune}}","replies":[{"poster":"CritTheClit","date":"2017-11-24T14:21:13.710+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"yes they did say yahoo it haha\nis there anything we as a community can do or have riot given any update in regards to false reporting .\ntbh i am not worried so much as surprised. i have honnor lvl5 and have gotten every honnor thingo you can get and don't think i have ever even been given a ban or anything.\ni am more so worried about other players that are left to the wolves in this sort of thing.\ni really love this game and would like to see it grow.\n\np.s. i was playing on the rift sorry for the late reply.\n\np.s.s. is there a board of player who go other the bands or is it all riot employers jobs. cuase i feel as players it would be cool if we could somehow be more involved.\n\np.s.s.s. any links to more data is handy or if these problems are already solved elsewhere link me i kinda am just getting used to the boards.\ni get lost alot in here i just leave my page open and refesh on it","replies":[{"poster":"Project Xayah","date":"2017-11-24T23:37:29.682+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"If you ever need/want some info on how systems are supposed to work, the ideal place to check would be the Support site, which contains various threads and FAQs relating to the in-game systems (though it does seem like some are a bit outdated, so if you have any questions about and of the info there feel free to ask on the boards [probably Help & Support]).

That said, there doesn't appear to be any updates on what has actually happened to the Tribunal, it appears the concept is something Riot has probably given up on at this point. Ideally, they'd still have it in the works and just not satisfied that it meets a reasonable standard, but I wouldn't expect that to be the case.\n\nReally, the best way to be involved with moderation and establishing that \"culture\" is to use the report system to notify Riot anytime you see behaviours you don't agree with. It's really the best we have at the moment, and not much can be done if Riot aren't acting on that feedback as they should. Unfortunate, but true.\n\nAs for the \"automated vs manual\" reviews, that's really something that comes down to Riot's internal systems. Most cases would be reviewed by the automated systems, which are designed to learn and adapt based on the behaviours that are reported. In some cases, a manual review would be required because of the limitations of the automated system, and sometimes manual reviews are done as a way to \"monitor\" the automated system, to try and keep it on the right track (you'll find people will have varying opinions of how effective that is). As far as I understand it, that's the way the system is designed to work.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Fitzky","date":"2017-11-24T11:39:06.554+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"You pretty much have to keep your mouth shut and take it otherwise you will get punished too, lovely isn't it?","replies":[{"poster":"CritTheClit","date":"2017-11-24T14:11:17.044+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"that really doesnt seem right ?  can anyone from riot confirm?","replies":[{"poster":"Fitzky","date":"2017-11-24T15:30:14.478+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Riot doesn't need to confirm anything just look at all the recent posts on 14 day suspensions on the boards all the evidence is right here","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"JasonWazza","date":"2017-11-24T10:05:56.265+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"You bend over and take it.\n\nOr at least that's basically riot's view on things.","replies":[{"poster":"CritTheClit","date":"2017-11-24T10:15:17.994+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"i don't believe this bud.","replies":[{"poster":"JasonWazza","date":"2017-11-24T11:57:55.210+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"I mean... you can choose to not believe it all you want, it doesn't change it from being Riot's stance.","replies":[{"poster":"CritTheClit","date":"2017-11-25T10:31:07.971+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"can you show me a link where they say t hat is there stance?","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"CritTheClit","date":"2017-11-24T10:16:08.181+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"see i have had dealing with riot and they have always helped in some way even just telling me idea around it","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"ThatsBS","date":"2017-11-24T11:45:48.428+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Were they premade?
