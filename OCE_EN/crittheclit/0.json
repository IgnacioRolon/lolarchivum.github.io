Ward have a countdown timer on them displayed on the top of the wards.\r\n2.When someone uses flash or igite and i press tab if anyone saw them do it it has a countdown timer on it.\r\n3. When i go to recall it will have 3 circles\r\n1 is red and small near me \r\n1 is green when nearer the enemy \r\n1 is yellow useally inbetween the red and green and these change depending on the champs. Also if i have the eye from the river they are different ithink they are to warn you of something no idea what.\r\n4. When i see the enemy jungle and they go into the fog a circle will grow from where they go and then disapear??\r\n5. Kinda annoying  but i learned about new site to see mrr and stats about the enemys but a pop up would happen during the load games screen where it would take me to a site that shows counter tricks and stuff about the people i am vsing\r\n6. At bot lane it would show me how much gold the other laner have and even my team mate along with health displayed as a numbers and mana.\r\nI tried updating my lol at home and it says it is up to date .... i even reinstalled it and my one at home doesnt have this. Is there something i am missing?\r\n\r\nAlso on the warding when you go to ward in would show in purple what vision your ward would have before you put it down if you held dowm the key.\r\nAnd lets you key bind more than one skill to the same key which was epic for my double heal combo.\r\n\r\nI just found it to be really handy with learning about warding and loads of stuff.","replies":[{"poster":"CritTheClit","date":"2017-07-27T01:22:27.234+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Omg almost forgot it also showed me the attack of the champs like there was a red circle around enemys and i had a blue one and team mates i think it was purple","replies":[{"poster":"CritTheClit","date":"2017-07-27T01:30:41.164+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"P.s. this was about three months ago and i have been playing for a while from home but i found it really helpful and i dont have the money to go to the net cafe its 5 bucks an hour","replies":[{"poster":"Gehirn","date":"2017-07-28T04:25:10.962+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Sounds to me like these were cheats installed on that machine.
