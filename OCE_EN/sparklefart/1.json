If you started on the red side, you would be trapped and couldn&#039;t pass the place where the barrier at the start of the game would be, unless you used flash or dashes. This has happened to me three times so far. I am on a mac (don&#039;t hate) and i know it has happened to people who are on Windows version aswell.\r\n\r\nSo whats up with that?","replies":[{"poster":"Ekrah","date":"2015-04-22T00:26:30.693+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Try posting your issue here. :)\n\nhttp://boards.oce.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/announcements/3EF5dzNV-patch-57-bugs-megathread","replies":[{"poster":"sparklefart","date":"2015-04-22T00:27:28.990+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Will do, will do","replies":[]}]}]}
