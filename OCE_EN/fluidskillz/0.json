If it doesn't fix itself in a few days I'd recommend giving your ISP a call to see if they can work out where things are going wrong.","replies":[{"poster":"FLUIDSKILLZ","date":"2018-04-06T12:44:57.131+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"i have a 60 mbps download plan but i only get like 2-3 mb download, i cant tell if its my laptop or isp","replies":[{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2018-04-06T15:53:13.361+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'm not sure if it's your issue but megaBITS (Mbs) and megaBYTES (MBs) are different (8 bits to a byte). ISPs typically advertise internet speeds in Megabits because companies know people like bigger numbers, especially relating to how fast things go. The speed test is consistent with that 60 number being megabits and 7.5 megabytes (good luck getting 60 megabytes/s in OCE).\n\n60 megabits/second would translate to about 7.5 megabytes/second, but you also have to take into account that ISPs will tell you the absolute best possible number you *can* get, not the number you can realistically expect. On a good day you'd wouldn't realistically expect more than 3/4 of that. Most of the time closer to 2/3 or 1/2. On longer or less optimised connections, or connections that are relying on things other than just point A (you) and point B (them) you'll get even less.\n\nAll that said, 300-400 KB/s is still really low. There were some issues recently but if it was League related your Steam wouldn't be affected, so I imagine it's a more universal thing and I really wouldn't know how to help you beyond calling your ISP and seeing if they can at least work out what the problem is. \n\nThat said, if you're on a wireless connection, I'd recommend trying a wired one, at least to DL your patches and stuff. It could have something to do with traffic priority.","replies":[]}]}]}]}
