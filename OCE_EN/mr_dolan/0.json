I personally like playing champs that can play 2 lanes so that you can focus more on improving on champs you play.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Wean","date":"2017-04-13T08:03:39.896+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Since you are level 30, be sure to get the appropriate tier 3 runes for your champions so that you will be strong, use 30 of them (drag the runes to your rune page) before you think about winning in pvp.\nCheck out champion.gg, look at the  runes of the champions you play.\nAlso set masteries for each role (not masteries for each champion because there is a limit of twenty mastery pages).\nPractise last hitting minions, as it will give you gold, at the moment the new League of Legends client has already been released, it has a practice tool, make use of that, you can fast forward game time, and use other commands in that game mode.\nPlay some custom games with/against your friends may help you to learn to fight against certain champions in pvp.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Akkordian Zoeve","date":"2017-04-02T20:29:42.465+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"From the looks of it, The Dolan is a smurf account (Mr Dolan is already in Bronze). But since you asked, here's what I have for \"The Dolan\":\n\n1. Get some runes. Just 2 quints isn't enough. If you go into a game with your AP runes (+9.9AP) vs my AP runes (+7.8 MPen, +216 Health at level 18, -10% CDR at level 18, +17.3 AP), who do think would win laning phase (ignoring any skill discrepancy)?\n\n2. The Tough Skin mastery is useless (imo). Seigemaster would be better, and would give you a bit more survivability in laning phase.\n\n3. Your average CS is 3/min, which isn't really that great. As a mid laner, you should be aiming for AT LEAST 5-6/min (which is about Bronze/low Silver level). The more CS you have, the more gold you get, which gives you better items earlier, which will make you stronger than your opponents, etc.\n\n4. I'm guessing you have a VERY aggressive play-style, since you have a lot of deaths each game. I would recommend sitting under/near tower and just focus on farming. Don't try to go for trades early (Cho and TF aren't too good early, especially versus a Yasuo), and try to avoid their attacks. That said, if your opponent does get too close, punish them.\n\nThat's about it. I can see you have a small champion pool (Cho and TF), which is good.\n\nHope this helps.","replies":[]}]}
