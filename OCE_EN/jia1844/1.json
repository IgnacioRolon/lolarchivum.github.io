So i really want to know what things did i do that made me scripting. First the enemy team has a veigar and he used his e on me which, i then sidestepped all the skillshots (wasn&#039;t much only 2 or 3) but i still ended up dying because i was auto&#039;ed to death. That was unfortunate. Second, shutter stepping there was a mechanic about shutter stepping and i believe it is riven&#039;s fast combo but instead on ranges for example adc, or what i also believe it is pretty much kiting, but they believe i was scripting because i was shutter stepping, but now that they call it scripting it made me very confused. Thirdly, predictions i was in my own jungle when the enemy team&#039;s zed suddenly jumped at me and i predicted where he would appear based on mind games and my prediction was correct so i w&#039;ed him for stun then killing him off afterwards using my other abilities. There was another time when the enemy&#039;s jinx was charging up her ultimate and since there is a brief delay and a animation i saw it and zhonya&#039;ed right away as it when through because i was untargetable. In the end after the game i was reported and got put in the lower priority queue for 5 games 20 minutes, which it doesn&#039;t feel really nice. I just want an explanation about what made them thinking about that i was scripting or did i anything that seems obvious when someone is scripting. The account i was playing on wasn&#039;t Jia1844 when i played the annie matchup it was on this account. Senpai Daisu. It would be much appreciated if someone can help me.
