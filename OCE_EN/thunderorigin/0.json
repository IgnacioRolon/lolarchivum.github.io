Bond duration 1, 1.5, 2 seconds on skill level. On exit both Kalista and oathsworn have move speed buff of 25% for one second.\r\n[redesign- less about engaging with big CC combos, or the Save a support, more about counter play mobility and mutual risk/reward]\r\n\r\n**Overview**\r\nIve done some basic calculations and here are some points to note:\r\nThe lane phase would be alot harder, mana on rend is worse, especially as harassing is weaker. The only up side would be to stack several creeps and pierce it through to the champion. An all arm.pen. rune page would fit this playstyle with a Q max lane phase, especially to help out with the cooldown.\r\nAll in at level 6 is actually harder to initiate and would require better positioning and support skills utility; but counter play would stronger.\r\nMid game utility is weaker, however the potential damage output for pierce through kills on front lines, transferring to back line squishy targets now that rend is gaining levels and hence armour pen on her skills. makes positional play far more important.\r\nLate game, with level 18, good positional play and support synergy, especially with the mini slow from W, the longer a sustained exchange can be prolonged, this is where Kalista&#039;s new high armour pen damage on Q and E shines with her phrase, &quot;soft are the targets of our spears&quot;.","replies":[{"poster":"YellowBrickRoad","date":"2016-08-18T02:11:39.555+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Besides kalista can already become a late game hyper carry.\n\nEach e stack is 60% total ad so assuming you always rend your target thats 150% ad ratio per auto before any crits are taken into consideration\n\nThrow in a runaans (and this is why its core on her) and that damage becomes aoe.\n\nAt 2.5 attack speed she can do 375% ad per second to everyone hit by her autos.\n\nThats quite a fair chunk of damage if you have even a slight bit of ad.\n\nlike say you have 200 ad so basically just a botrk and guinsoos (which also improves dps as you stack 3 rends per 2 autos)\n\nyou would do 750 dps not counting crits, the double stacking of guinsoos, botrk damage etc\n\nThats just the autos and rends, not to mention the bulk of that damage is done via a burst so good luck just lifestealing through it.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Miicka","date":"2016-08-17T23:20:23.803+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You have a good idea sir.\n\nBut the thing is that ADC's being late game hyper carry's is somewhat generic now, it seems as if all the ADC's are 'late game hyper carry's' now.\n\nI really like how Kalista is unique in that way and that she is played for her strong mid game. Also, she can be strong late game, as her ult provides easy peel and engage and a good Kalista player can always do great damage late game if they kite well.\n\nHowever, I don't own Kalista, I've only actually ever played her when she's been on the free week, but I do play a lot of 'late game hyper carry's' (e.g. Vayne, Jinx, Kog) and quite frankly I do think there are too many.","replies":[]}]}
