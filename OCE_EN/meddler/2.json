Karma's probably the clearest example of that, with I'd argue 3 distinct versions, each of which has players who preferred that particular form. Meeting the needs of any given group then involves trade offs for the others.  We did look at getting the shield bomb back onto the kit last year but concluded while it met the needs of fans of older versions of Karma it would come at the expense of a lot of current players.","replies":[{"poster":"SilverSquid","date":"2019-10-16T11:26:53.159+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I see mainly 3 version too. \nOld Karma = toplane = mage bruiser like vlad&amp;swain\nNew Karma (3.5-5.10) = midlane = mage support like Morgana &amp; Orianna\nCurrent Karma = support = enchanter like Lulu &amp; Janna\n\nHowever I think current Karma has issues due to her main role (support) doing mostly nothing but AoE shield lategame and with the addition of the shield items/runes this has become a questionable position for a champion to be in. And not fulfilling her potential or fantasy (duality, leader, twin dragons). \n\nDo you think a VGU like Irelia's is needed to deliver her fantasy properly?\nOr do you think a partial reversal to \"New Karma\" is better (with some more modern values to her passive and RW), since it is somewhat of a middleground?","replies":[]},{"poster":"McwhinneyTw","date":"2019-10-17T00:05:35.691+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hi Riot Meddler\n\nMost of the Karma players love to play her on midlane \nI think you shall focus on her midlane game play and try like to give back the 60% Q Ap ratio we had before\n\nWe all love to play it on Midlane, we trust you Meddler , for the 10 years of LoL pls , do something for Karma on midlane\n\nA Karma main since 5 years desesperate message","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"TheBioB","date":"2019-10-15T21:15:24.591+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I think they will bring back the old champions for a game mode.

Would like to ask you a question,  if you were able to revert a change or go through with a change that you didn't end up going through with in the end in league what would they be?

We got some good results I feel (e.g. Darius or Caitlyn) but had a lot of misses as well. Overall tried to do too much at once and quality really suffered, leading to some champs that needed to be reverted and others that were sidegrades instead of upgrades (which is still a failure since that time could have made other parts of the game better instead).\n\nA change we didn't do but I wish we had - Something we tested a couple of years ago were units we were calling 'base guards'. They were team affiliated and roamed around in your side of the jungle. They'd attack enemy champions, so you could move to them for help with invades. They were also worth quite a bit of gold and never respawned, so gave another success condition for assassins/other burst champs. We didn't ship them because we couldn't get the gameplay right, they ended up feeling like trivial challenge for gold, or irrelevant, or too warping on normal play etc. I'm not sure if there is a good form of them out there, I would have loved to have found and shipped one though.","replies":[{"poster":"Danasko","date":"2019-10-15T22:05:35.717+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Ahh I see!
