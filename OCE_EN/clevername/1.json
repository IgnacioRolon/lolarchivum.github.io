As soon as the one enemy champion is not around me lag is gone. Mana vanishes randomly without casting ability. rake up the minion kills but gaining no gold. no bonus such as heal +6 are being counted. ability 400+ can't do any dmg to enemy team. Join new game lag gone, don't dominate no lag. I think its more suspicious, yet lol never admits something is wrong or going on or does anything about it. I have IP boost on and not gaining extra ip as well.
