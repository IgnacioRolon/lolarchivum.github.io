He has trolled in 7 games in his match history which goes back 2 days and I feel that both him and his clan need to be reviewed for racist speech and negative behavior. He's adamant that he wont get banned because sometimes the report system lets us down, but if I could acquire the chat log I feel I could at least make a case against him myself. No one should have to put up with people like this in their matches.","replies":[{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2019-10-14T10:20:32.765+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"If you report the player in post-game the chat log will be reviewed by the [Instant Feedback System](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/207489286-Instant-Feedback-System-FAQ-).\n\nIf for whatever reason you can't or forgot to report them in post-game you can report them via [Player Support](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/207489286-Instant-Feedback-System-FAQ-).

There's also not a lot of direct feedback on reports because in the interest of both privacy and reform (and various other things) Riot can't and won't reveal any information about another player's account to a third party (you or me for example).\n\nAs a *general* rule, gameplay behaviours take longer to analyse and judge because it's harder to determine intent. Is this player playing like this because they are tilted or because they are intentionally trying to ruin the game? Maybe this is the first time chat has come into it at all. \n\nI can say that racist chat is a really fast way to get punished, and also something that is quite regularly (though not always) escalated (skipping chat restrictions and moving straight into a 14-day ban).\n\nAs far as your report itself, it's probably not the answer you want but as I said, there are reasons Riot doesn't give direct feedback on reports. There is one notification that *sometimes* pops up when someone is punished as a result of a report you made, but it's extremely limited, and not seeing it doesn't mean nothing was done, it just means your individual report didn't meet the exceedingly limited criteria to show it.\n\n*Every* report is viewed by the IFS, and every report sent to support is manually reviewed *eventually*, though like I said that's a much slower process and they still can't actually give you any response beyond the usual (and granted, frustratingly generic) \"thanks for your report, we can't say anything, keep using post-game\".","replies":[{"poster":"JasonWazza","date":"2019-10-15T02:05:37.428+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"\"and every report sent to support is manually reviewed eventually\"\n\nJust to be clear, do you mean support ticket, or are you actually referring to the report system?","replies":[{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2019-10-15T03:17:26.490+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"If I say \"the system\" I'm referring to the IFS, if I say \"support\" I'm referring to player support.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]}
