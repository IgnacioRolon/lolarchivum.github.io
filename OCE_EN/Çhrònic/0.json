I&#039;ll then have to swap over to another router we have and it will go back down, but this has caused me to fall behind a bit.\n\nI was thinking it would be cool to have a little box that displays your ping the whole time in the client.\n\nThis way you would be able to see if it fluctuates or  spikes and you may be able to fix it or play later when it&#039;s better, this way you&#039;d be able to see it before you queue and even in champ select - instead of seeing it when the games already started.\n\nCould add like a little coloured shape or just display the number?\n\nCheers.","replies":[{"poster":"Inf3cti0n","date":"2016-10-14T22:20:57.594+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"Great idea.  It would certainly cut down on a lot of people DCing from games.  If they were aware they were having connection issues before they started the game they likely wouldn't queue until the issue was resolved.  Definitely +1 this idea.","replies":[]},{"poster":"SilverLightning","date":"2016-10-18T06:07:36.110+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I've heard why they can't implement this, apparently its because the client cannot access the ping of the game. You can check your ping, but you can do that with simple speedtests online, but the client ping will be different to the game ping. I asked this question at a riot Q and A session at UTS.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Kaze Enigma","date":"2016-10-17T08:56:49.614+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I am all over this idea.
