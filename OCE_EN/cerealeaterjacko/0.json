I am in bronze 5 with 3.6k  I.P, Is she worth or should i buy someone else.

First one was Darius, then I had Irelia and now it is Sivir. She just has that little extra awesomeness that most other champions don't have. and it might take a few games to get a handle of her but it is worth it. you can pull off some sick as plays with here. Not to mention there are many different ways ou can build her. one of the best champs in my opinion. and she is actually strong as well. especially against any squishy top laners.","replies":[]},{"poster":"DannyMac","date":"2016-07-29T12:26:27.043+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Definitely worth.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Roguestoney","date":"2016-07-28T20:40:49.995+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Irelia is always decent.","replies":[]}]}
