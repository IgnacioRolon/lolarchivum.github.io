It appears that i have apparently sent a link from a website at 1:26 PM. This OBVIOUSLY CAN&#039;T BE TRUE as I have school from 8 am to 3 pm, and i have no way of accessing the league client in any way possible. \r\n\r\nAny tips on what I should do? I will be changing my password now, hopefully to prevent any more interactions happening. :(","replies":[{"poster":"Wuks","date":"2016-04-27T09:40:49.779+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey Jayca,\n\n\nIt's more than likely that your account may have been compromised. As such, please take all of the steps below to regain control of your League of Legends account and reverse any unwanted actions that the individual who compromised your account may have taken:\n\n\n1. Run a complete anti-virus scan on your computer and remove any malware that is detected. If you don't have an anti-virus program, I recommend downloading either [**MalwareBytes Free**](https://www.malwarebytes.org/mwb-download/) or [**ESET NOD32 with a free 30 day trial**](http://download.eset.com/special/live-installer/us/eset_nod32_antivirus_live_installer.exe). Either or should be able to get the job done. \n2. Once the scans have run and any detections are removed, change any accounts/passwords that you believe may have been compromised. This may include your email account(s), League of Legends account (if you still have access to it; if not, skip to the \"Submitting a ticket\" step), and Riot Games Player Support account if you already have one. You can change your League of Legends password by going to the [**League of Legends account area**](https://account.leagueoflegends.com/na/en/protect) in the top-right corner of this page. Click on your summoner name, and select \"Settings\". In the box that comes up, click \"Change Password\" and follow said steps. (Make sure that your email account is secure before doing this step, as a confirmation email will be sent to the corresponding email account.)","replies":[{"poster":"Jayca","date":"2016-04-28T05:54:20.259+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thanks for the quick reply! I've downloaded the MalwareBytes program and doing a scan now. I've also already changed my League password, going to change my email password now as well. \n\nIf I have anymore problems, I'll make sure to keep you updated","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Mint Iz Back","date":"2016-04-28T05:09:25.733+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"http://boards.oce.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/help-support-oce/p5fMAvbp-umm-perma-ban\n\nRip I Think it happened to me Well their goes my F***ing lvl 30 account","replies":[]}]}
