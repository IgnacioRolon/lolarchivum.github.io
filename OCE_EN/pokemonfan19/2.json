I have some ideas in my head but I would like to hear yours, please.  \nEdit: I had to do my homework so here are my ideas:\n\nIdea 1: More of a buff\n- Increase the healing by 20%, adding up to 40%\n- Affects small minions as well\n\nIdea 2: Additonal effects at rank 5\n- Dark Binding spreads to nearby targets, but instead of rooting they are slowed instead.\n- Tormented Soil grounds the target(s), preventing them from using mobile abilities\n- Black Shield explodes when it expires or is destroyed, briefing rooting nearby enemies in the area.\n\nEdit: Idea 2 (due to being too oppressive)\n- Now called Spirit Leech\n- New effect: Whenever Morgana deals damage to an enemy champion, monsters, and/or minions, the nearest ally and herself get 25% damage boost, and a 20% life steal. \n- The duration is infinite until one of them reaches the limit of their radius.\n- To balance the passive, it will go on a 5 minute cooldown at the start of the match.\n- Normal cooldown after walking out of the radius is 20 seconds.\n- Procs even without allies around.\n\nIdea 3 (again, idea 2 is too imbalanced)\n- Now called Kindred Spirit\n- Life steal increased from 20% to 25%\n- New effect: If Kayle and Morgana are in the same team, they get \"Kindred Spirit.\"\n- Kindred Spirit is an unbreakable bond between two sisters, each gaining flat 5/10/15/20 Armour and Magic Resist and a 5%/7.5%/12.5%/15%  health increase when near each other (at levels 1/6/11/16), or 5%/7.5%/12.5%15% bonus movement speed and damage boost when near each other (at levels 1/6/11/16).\n- If neither Kayle nor Morgana is on the same team, one of them can apply Kindred Spirit onto a chosen ally permanently, but the benefits will be halved.\n\nAnything else?","replies":[{"poster":"C9 Snocky","date":"2019-03-01T11:09:49.037+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Still an obscenely strong passive. Like that passive is so good it's almost worthy of being its own champion. 25% bonus damage and 20% bonus lifesteal on two champions. Imagine a full AP morgana AND say a Veigar. A standard veigar gets ~1000 AP. You're talking about a 250 AP boost onto that Veigar, as well as a ~100 AP boost onto the AP morgana AND 20% lifesteal per person.\n\nLiterally just coordinate to stay close and you permanently have it as well.\n\nJhin sticks out as an obscene offender since he hits 600-800 AD in a game, so for him, he could not build a BloodThirster and still end up with better stats than if you did. Like, we're talking a 6 item Jhin with higher stats than a 7 item Jhin, PERMANENTLY","replies":[]},{"poster":"C9 Snocky","date":"2019-02-28T07:12:50.182+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I dont agree with idea 2.
