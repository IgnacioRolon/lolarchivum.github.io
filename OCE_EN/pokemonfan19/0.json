Don't make the mistake I did early on of spending loads of RP on skins that you love, but will never use because you don't play the champ. \n\nIf you get good skins in your \"your Shop\" with a >50% discount, that's the place to buy them, as you'll more than likely never see them cheaper. \n\nFor new skins, if you aren't super impatient like me, or especially if it's not a skin for someone you play all the time (which for me only covers 3-4 champs), wait for those early sales.\n\nI would offer the same advice as the others, and leave chromas and champs to buy with BE. I spent RP on champs real early on, and it was never really worth it, certainly not if you've never played them on free to play weeks.","replies":[]},{"poster":"DarkShade918","date":"2018-12-25T08:12:05.035+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Do not buy champs or chromas with RP, that's just a waste considering you can get a champ whenever, and the essence emporium opens for chromas every now and then.\n\nCan't make a call on the \"your shop\" skins, since you didn't tell us the percent off you're getting\n\nOf those 3 skins, none of them are good, don't waste money on them","replies":[]}]}
