There are a few reasons why we intentionally did not include any sort of progress indicators:\n1.) As to your point, we didn't want to focus the system on the \"grind\". We want your honor level to improve over the course of the season as you play sportsmanlike games. Giving you a number to anchor on would shift the focus away from just playing good games.\n2.) We holistically evaluate behavior over time behind the scenes using some pretty crazy algorithms to determine when a player levels up. It doesn't work super well as a progress indicator that we show to a player, and if we did, it would probably be more confusing than helpful.\n3.) We wanted a few discrete levels that have enough space to be meaningful, but over the course of a season, if you had a progress indicator, you might feel that you were making so little progress per game that seeing the progress could actually feel bad. We could inflate the number of levels to counteract this, but that felt really unnecessary.\nHopefully that clarifies it a bit!\"","replies":[]},{"poster":"PurpIe","date":"2017-06-30T07:09:37.055+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I actually posted recently regarding the same thing.\n\nI don't think Riot would make a tracker/progress bar type thing because people can easily abuse the system knowing how close they're to the next level/low close they are to demoting etc.\n\nIt's sweet you're getting honours :) Its an even cooler experience getting a special emblem in the post game lobby showing you had the most honours (most honourable on the team) :D","replies":[]}]}
