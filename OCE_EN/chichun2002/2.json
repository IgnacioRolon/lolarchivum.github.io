As a Syndra however you are in an interesting case that you can clear a miniom wave quite easily with an Q and W. \n\nIn the case of the example you have given, when you have killed the enemy laner or they have gone missing and want to push I would say that it depends on 3 things. The first of which being your HP Value (if you are low after killing them it can make things quite hard.), The information you have about the location of the enemy jungler and where your location.\n\nBased on the answer to these questions it can effect what you choose to do. Often the safe choice is to use a combo on the waves and recall without pushing up too far but enough so that wave crashes into the tower.\n\n---\n\nThere are some things to make I easier though. You will notice that a lot of high elos mid laners like to get an defensive item early on in the game. The main reason for them doing this is so that when they fight with the enemy laner they will have more hp coming out of it, letting them push the wave and survive the enemies brust combo instead of getting one shot.\n\nDoing this also lets you do fun things such as setting up fights easier in the late game because of your extra defensive stats and taking enemy jungler camps between waves if you push them.\n\n---\n\nAs a side note when the enemy laner is roaming or you want to roam, a strategy that you can use/be aware of is some mid laners like to roam to a side of the river that isnt warded and wait in a bush to ambush you when you try to counter roam. In the case of them not following you can call your jungler to come kill the enemy mid laners that is probably over extended pushing or finish your roam.\n\n---\n\nI hope that this helps if there is any other questions I can answer or any way i can lend a hand let me know. Good luck in your games!\n\n~Elam","replies":[{"poster":"ROGU3","date":"2017-01-07T06:58:15.024+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"If Syndra started an early defensive item, wouldn't she be completely useless?

Granted, it's hard to know where some of those sneaky junglers are going to come from.\n\n\nYou could simply ask your jungler to help you take the tower? Map objectives are one of their responsibilities after all.\n\nHowever, in the case of Syndra, if you've just used your ultimate to make your laner back, or kill them, you are in a relatively vulnerable state. This is true for most champions that have a large portion of their power budget on R. {{champion:1}} {{champion:90}} {{champion:45}} \n\nIf you're frequently dying to ganks, maybe you could try out a champion that is a more consistent threat? That has a lot more impact without their ultimate. {{champion:13}} {{champion:63}} {{champion:163}} \n\nThat way, at least you can fight back during attempted ganks, or perhaps not even get ganked at all? :)","replies":[]}]}
