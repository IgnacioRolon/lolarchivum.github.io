If you focus on beating zed as an individual target on the map you're just playing by his terms.  Your friend is probably so happy you keep playing into his hand.\n\nZed is a champion devised purely for winning 1v1 lanes - hopefully scaling enough in gold and levels to have an impact in the late game i.e assassinate the other team's carries. He starts to struggle later in the game as he does not benefit from building tank items and is best duelling - leaving him vulnerable in team fights. Zed will try to harrass you with shurikens that he uses to clear waves. He will try to whittle your health down, box you in your turret and kill you there, using his shadows to move in and out.\n\nThe best way to counter him is to not engage him, and instead clear the waves, keep your health up and recall if you have to. . If he goes to roam, just track his movements and counter gank. The moment after hes used his spells in a roam bot or top is when he is weakest - strike him down as he returns from roaming.\n\nI suggest a champ you're comfortable with that has some late game utility and aoe - things zed cant compete with.","replies":[{"poster":"Nightjar","date":"2017-01-15T14:46:24.436+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"or you know, play Fizz and troll poll your way to victory in lane.

Let me go over a few I think would work great vs Zed in a 1v1.\n\n---\n\n# Garen\n\nThis will be one of your strongest choices going into this matchup in my opinion. You will be able to silence him if he ever tries to all in you, sustain through his poke with his W and passive and have a ton of damage if he does actually decide to fight you. Often some Garen players when they are in a matchup that they don't really want to fight at level 1 they will pick up W level 1 to help sustain until they have all 3 abilities. This might be something to consider.\n\nAlong with this build wise you have two options, you can either go full damage or go tanky. In my opinion since this is 1v1 both could work quite well. If it is the case that you are on Summoners rift and gold is a bit harder to come by, you might want to go a bit more tanky with your items. However if its the case that you are on Howling Abyss you could start out with some more aggressive items.\n\n---\n\n# Irelia\n\nThis is my personal favorite champion to play if I know I am vsing a Zed in 1v1. Irelia has a really strong trading potential and is able to shut down Zed if he engages on her simply by stunning him with her E. For reference this is a matchup that I would highly suggest maxing E on as the extra stun time on the Zed will make a big difference in the trades that you have with him. Along with this you can do some fancy stuff such as using your Q to dodge the poke that he throws at you, and then engage on him immediately if you got a reset off of the Q. \n\n---\n\n# Riven\n\nFor the Riven vs Zed matchup this is one I wouldn't really suggest doing unless you are confident in your Riven trading and combos. However this matchup does come with its advantages. Riven has high damage that allows her to trade with Zed quite easily if she is able to get onto him, she is able to shield the poke that he throws at her with her E and if she times it right, she can actually block the poke and use the E that was blocking damage to get in range for a stun to start a fight with the Zed in melee range.\n\nThis matchup can be good fun and can really come down to individual player skill, but do be careful of Zed's ultimate. Some Zeds in this matchup will wait until you are going to fire your windslash and then dodge the damage with Zed ult turning the tides of the trade. Something to be aware of and keep in mind.\n\n---\n\nI hope that this helps, if you give these champions a try let me know how it goes. In 1v1s as well often taking Exhaust and Ignite instead of flash can help a lot as well, and if its the case that you want to just out poke the Zed and punish him before he hits 6, give it a try to Caitlyn. Cait is an extremely strong 1v1 champion and has some cool things in this matchup such as standing on top of traps if she gets Zed ulted.\n\nGood luck in your games!\n\n~Elam","replies":[{"poster":"Nightjar","date":"2017-01-15T14:44:51.218+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Alternatively, Cho'gath, Mundo, Fizz, Shaco and Vlad are all pretty good at dueling Zed, since they have ways to counter his ult and outduel him.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Wean","date":"2017-01-15T07:35:00.612+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The best thing you can do to counter Zed is to play Zed first, this will give you an idea of how to counter him.

Stun him with Q to bait out his W, then build another stun to get more kill pressure so you can farm faster to get levels first. Save stun for after his ult, and don't get baited into using your stun early.\n\n{{summoner:3}} his combo and ms, be aware that the ult's stored damage is based of premitigation values, so you'll best benefit if you delay the to time exhaust so you also reduce the damage of the ult and the end of the exhaust\n\n {{summoner:21}} requires less timing, just barrier when he is going for a ult combo.\n\nALSO: be aware that getting hit by zed E (Shadow Slash) shaves 2 seconds of his W shadow. Try to avoid standing close to him to maximise the window between his W shadows.

Sustain off waves. He should be around 40% hp and you should stay around 80%. Learn the timing and when he ults you Q right at your feet, auto once in the air then use W only if you have enough mana to R after it. W when he appears followed by auto R is effective too. \nCongratulations, you just learnt the magic trick \"how to make zed players rage\".","replies":[]},{"poster":"CHEESYLEEKS","date":"2017-01-14T02:26:01.515+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Urgot","replies":[]},{"poster":"Lord Sesshomaru","date":"2017-01-13T12:15:19.551+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Kayle is a natural counter, So is Lissandra, and Vladimir.\n\nFizz can do very well against him too _(if you nullify his ult with your Playful/Trickster)_, and he will be able to kill Zed much quicker than the other 3.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Derikay","date":"2017-01-13T12:12:23.939+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Diana does well against him in my experience.\nBut, most of Zeds \"one shot\" potential comes with his ult.\nIf you CC him, after he has come out of his ult, he can not do much, and will usually die.\nI would not recommend taking ignite against him.\nExhaust or maybe barrier is best against him.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Lajneen","date":"2017-01-15T21:42:03.401+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"It's not that your friend is really good, you're just really bad.","replies":[]}]}
