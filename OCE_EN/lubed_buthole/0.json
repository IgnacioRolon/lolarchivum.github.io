She does 50-100% AD bonus damage. So even base, her 1st auto will do roughly 74 damage.\n\nGranted if you can't proc her passive she loses damage, but if you can constantly switch targets, say, minion, champion, minion, champion. Thats a lot of extra damage. Plus the Q bonus damage and prioritising marked targets.\n\nChanged her play style from an extended trade winner to a poker (instead of being both). Especially with the W change.","replies":[{"poster":"Omni Presents","date":"2015-11-12T08:37:06.026+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"So you would rather get the bonus damage by swapping from target to target rather than just forgo the bonus and constantly put more damage on the same target? Sure, why not.","replies":[{"poster":"BarryButcher","date":"2015-11-12T11:04:55.162+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"i didn't say i'd rather it, but it is a \"unique playstyle\".
