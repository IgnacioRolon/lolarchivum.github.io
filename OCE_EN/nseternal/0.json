That's like using your q 5 times then you're out of mana. By the time you hit level 6, the enemy jungler would have already ganked once, if not twice.\n\nAgain, her passive at lower levels isn't as effective as it used to be (thanks to all the nerfs), and with those 5 q's you aren't going to be able to get much sustain off of it.\n\nThrowing out charms in laning phase is already a bad idea imo, costing 85 mana at all ranks, and if you were to hit a charm and try to chunk their health, running out of mana is usually what happens. A full combo at level 5 costs (if you are maxing q first) 210 of your 490 mana that is probably already gone if you've been using that \"lots of sustain\" passive. \n\nGetting ganked by someone, say, {{champion:254}} , and this happens:\n\n1. Vi charges q\n2. Ahri charms her in the middle of casting it, and in this leaves room for the other laner to come in and stun (if they are leblanc, syndra, anivia, twisted fate, etc.)\n3. Ahri gets stunned\n4. Full combo'd by the enemy laner\n5. Ahri flashes out OR dies from the jungler walking up and finishing her off.\n\nIn the end, ahri doesnt have a strong laning phase compared to someone like {{champion:90}} or {{champion:30}} , but if you can get past that, her late game is amazing. \n\n<3 {{champion:103}}","replies":[{"poster":"Lord Sesshomaru","date":"2016-01-15T01:16:59.317+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"And yet dispite that, \"thanks to all those nerfs\" she still has a 53% Winrate and a 16.5% pick rate.\n\nPlus all ahri's still spam Q every time it's off cooldown and they never run out of mana, especially once they start buying.\n\nAnd in your Vi gank analogy you forgot to press R three times.\n\nI won't hear anyone say she is weak or disadvantaged, \nIf ahri gets ganked she's more likely to survive than if a TF or a Karthus etc etc, you can't dispute that. Obviously she can't survive every single gank because then she would be so broken that riot would even have to admit it.

Once she starts buying items she's out of laning phase, which is what we've been arguing about this whole time. Again, she has a stong post-laning phase, and a weak laning phase. \n\nAn easy way to kill her is to all-in her when she has no mana left, and you'll read that on just about every guide out there as far as counters go.","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Sailor Jupiter","date":"2016-01-15T06:58:24.672+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Ahri has a great laning phase, she can do well against most anyone.\nShe has good wave clear with a bit of AP, great burst, fantastic mobility with her ult and Q to help escape from ganks or chase someone down, and she has sustain on top of all that.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Olee","date":"2016-01-14T19:25:20.738+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Ahri was easily the best Solo queue mid laner for season 5 ever since patch 5.2.
