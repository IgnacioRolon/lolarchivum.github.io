I WAS LEFT ATTEMPTIN A 1V5 AND WE(I) LOST HORRIBLY. I noticed there names were similar so they were obviously premade. I asked the enemy team to report them and they did and I just hope that you guys will report them or ban them as well.","replies":[{"poster":"Ing√©nue","date":"2015-02-17T01:27:23.725+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Sometimes people play pre made and play off the same internet source (I live in a house with 6 other league players) and sometimes weird things happen to the internet, just like when s single player disconnects and reconnects a short time after. the problem being that either everyone, or the majority of everyone (like in your case) disconnect. Usually, it isn't their fault and I doubt that they would intentionally AFK in the situation you are describing, I also doubt that they would have foreseen such a tragic event as an internet cutout. \n\nTL:DR Probably not intentional on their behalf.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Iosua Bot","date":"2015-02-16T22:44:31.618+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Well that sucks.
