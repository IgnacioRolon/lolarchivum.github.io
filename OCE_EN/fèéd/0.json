They'll take you through the review process, which will involve a manual review of the case. The first response *may* be a generic \"copy-paste\" type of thing, additional responses typically become more personalised to the case. Keep in mind, it may take a day or two to receive a response (possibly longer if Support is busy), and that their decision will be final.\n\nThe standard punishment tiers for chat-related offences go from chat restrictions (10-game then 25-game) *then* into bans (14-day then permanent). If you haven't followed that process you *may* have a reasonable case for appeal.\n\nSo far as the logs go, it seems like the kind of behaviour that would constitute \"negative attitude\", specifically a passive-aggressive style in my opinion. Such behaviour can certainly contribute to punishments, but it's unlikely to result in such in and of itself (particularly bans if you've not already received chat restrictions). In future, I'd recommend that you not say anything if it can't be positive, as that will help \"passively\" improve your games and reduce the likelihood of being punished.\n\nThe thing that sticks out most is this particular comment \"call me a retard all you want\". It's important to note that \"repeating\" certain terms/phrases that others have said can result in this kind of situation, where the punished player may not have demonstrated an \"excessively toxic\" attitude but still receives a ban. In future, I'd recommend that you avoid repeating what others have said, particularly things that can fall into abuse/harassment categories. When submitting an appeal to Support, drawing their attention to this distinction *may* help your case (though is not guaranteed to).","replies":[{"poster":"Fèéd","date":"2019-02-01T12:53:06.293+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The funny thing is that the other player i was talking to, he was flaming the whole entire game and repeatedly using slurs and whatever and in the end i was the one that got banned :/","replies":[{"poster":"Project Xayah","date":"2019-02-02T03:19:02.062+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"As I said, your best bet is to submit a ticket to Support. I can't make any guarantees on how that will help as I don't have all the information, but it is possible they will be able to reduce or remove the punishment, depending on the specific circumstances. If you need any further assistance dealing with your case, you can feel free to ask, though keep in mind that only Support can change the ruling.\n\nSo far as other players go, their behaviour does not excuse your own. If they're being assholes, the best thing you can do is ignore them (generally, when someone is being toxic they're looking for *any* response) and report them in the post-game lobby (and by submitting a ticket to Support if you think it's necessary). It's not a perfect solution, but that's how life is, and we have to learn to cope with things rather than letting them get out of hand. If they're acting as you say they are, they *should* be punished sooner or later (so long as they're being reported).","replies":[{"poster":"Fèéd","date":"2019-02-03T15:16:28.089+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"They didn't bother doing anything because i was \"arguing\".\nIt's league ffs.
