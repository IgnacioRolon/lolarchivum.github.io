Every time I watch a vod or tune in to a live stream, it says at the bottom via a notification that my account is setup correctly to receive rewards, but I'm yet to actually get any. Is this a glitch?\r\n\r\nI'm currently watching the LPL and been watching various other live events during the week and still haven't received that stupid Foam Finger of Desstiny, what gives? Wouldn't mind the system actually working zzzzz","replies":[{"poster":"Kill the adc","date":"2019-03-15T06:27:58.210+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"If anyone gets stuck with this like I did, there's some more information here: https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/360001976407-Esports-Watch-Missions\n\nNothing on that list helped me however, but it might help you! \n\nTonight I'm testing out a different browser to see if that makes a difference.","replies":[]}]}
