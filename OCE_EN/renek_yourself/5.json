Until the game ends and they say something along the lines of that is the only person i've seen not feed on Ashe. Ashe was really good and balanced before the re-work. You're right, she was fine before. The burst was good and at the trade off of some time focusing. Then they reworked her and she was OP? at the start but good after some changes. I really got to like Ashe at that point, building no crit items on her only assassin and it worked out pretty well. But what the fuck did they just do to her now. She feels so clunky. 4 Stacks on Q. W hitbox getting soaked up by 1 minion. Less damage on W. Slow's don't do shit till past lvl 14 which if you make it to without being 0/10 means you've probably already won the game 4v5. Slows don't do shit when Quinn can instakill you, twitch can instakill you, vayne can instakill you. Pretty much any champ atm. Ashe is in a weird spot and won't find her pre-rework winrates unless something gets changed. Probably will be the first season i give Ashe the skip :( \n\nSimilar thing is with poppy. Those who knew how to play her were gods on it, as it should be. Fiora as well before was godly if you knew how to play her. Sure she was pretty one dimensional, but that was her strength and weakness. I loved her kit before. All about game knowledge and knowing when you can and can't fight. \n\nRiot seems to be trying to complicate every character now. But i think for most of us, we fell in love with LoL because of the simple kits. The easy to pick up, hard to master aspect. Not too happy with Riot's game design direction, but what can you do aye. \n\nIdk, just little pre-season sadness kicking in. This season will be a hard climb","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Grazer","date":"2016-01-19T14:06:58.356+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'm looking forward to the Taric rework.
