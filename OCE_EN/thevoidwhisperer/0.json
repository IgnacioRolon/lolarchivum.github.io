I'm pretty sure I'm up to date on the vast majority of lores in this game.\n\nI mean maybe you could argue the fall of Shurima, but I would say that's not really conclusive and honestly serves as more of an introduction to the current conflicts between characters than it's own complete story. \n\nWe also still have a few loose ends in the Bilgewater lore.
