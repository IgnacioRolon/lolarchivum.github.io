That new system on champion experience is (I believe I haven&#039;t actually looked into it) a skill level for champion kinda thing, for example you do well as Blitzcrank for 100 games you get 50 levels and people know you&#039;re badass at blitz. What about merging the two ideas of chroma packs and this champion experience system? for example, hitting level 50 on Blitzcrank would unlock the red Blitzcrank option and everyone would think you&#039;re a badass whilst playing with you.\r\n\r\nAgain, not my idea but I think it&#039;s great.","replies":[{"poster":"oops","date":"2015-05-05T08:06:59.409+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"But that doesn't make them money, riot like money.","replies":[{"poster":"RudeKaiser","date":"2015-05-05T08:10:02.087+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Riot doesn't already make enough money?
