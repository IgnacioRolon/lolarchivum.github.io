I have 1600+ games in Dota 2 and 600+ in League of Legends. I've started playing LOL more now because of how bad Dota stresses me out, and I have more friends that play League. I main support in both games.\n\nRecent changes to Support characters have been very, very upsetting to me. Sona's passive aura was replaced by a weird AOE utility feature don't quite like. Soraka was completely reworked in ways that don't jive with me. My old standby for a fun, easy poke lane was Zilean and his timebomb change sort of ruins his appeal to me. Taking a lot of the old, \"lame\" supports and making them SUPER-ACTION PACKED so that even the little kids can enjoy them has *worked*, but it doesn't work with me. Someone told me my griping was unfounded and was an instant negative reaction to change in general, but Riot apparently didn't think so. Meet Bard, the best champion ever.\n\n**Passive**\nBard is passive, in a good way. A lot of good ways. He does extremely little damage, which is probably a trade-off for his massive utility. Instead of requiring Bard to poke constantly, you're allowed to relax and think about other things besides your lane and the \"exchange game\". The incessant back-and-forth exchanging of lanes isn't Bard's top priority, because he can easily keep the ADC's health up in a poke lane. You're allowed to relax a little, and this is so nice after losing all my passive supports. He still remains mentally engaging, despite not being super active. This keeps him from being boring.\n\n**Utility**\nOne of the main reasons i feel that Soraka, Sona, and Zilean were reworked to take away their passiveness is, while they were *strong* and *balanced*, they sometimes wouldn't do much besides exist in teamfights. Bard introduces multiple mechanics never seen in any champion, breaking the mold completely by bringing something new to the table with every button. This compensates for his lack of damage by making him awesome in *all the right ways*, allowing him to actually support in the most literal sense of the word. Bard's strengths come from enabling teammates. That's indescribably cool.\n\n**Heavy Mechanics**\nI don't say this lightly: *He feels like a Dota champion*. I mean that in all the right ways. You're constantly thinking about where you want healing wards, when you should open portals, how you should land your ultimate to do the most good. His ultimate is also so fresh. Usually Riot makes things *too* balanced. In Dota, you have every champion OP. A lot of them can intentionally grief teammates. But that flexibility in allowing you to affect your allies is also what enables you to make the biggest plays. Bard's ult is the first time I've seen Riot trust the player enough to grief teammates, and the result is a huge ult that allows for massive plays.\n\n**I love him**\nHe's the only champion I really felt a connection with. Playing him is magical. His voice is like wind chimes, there's pretty noises in everything he does. His abilities are beautiful. He's personable in ways no other champion is. After only a handful of games I was in love. I can see me playing him over, and over, and over again. The level of uniqueness in his kit and the potential he has makes every game super fun, even losing ones. He's the type of champion you screw up with and understand what you did wrong and how you can do better next time.\n\n\nBard is 8/8 gr8.","replies":[{"poster":"Riot Terra","date":"2015-03-14T02:50:16.615+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Glad you like him!

With bard it also hits enemies so it's alright, but KoTL's instant teleport into bad places button is just downright unfair. And it comes with at so many limitations like timing and the huge charge up before the area freezes. I used to play Io and bind whoever then simply teleport to gank without caring about who I teleported and whether they were ready or not. I've never had problems running from Bard when his weird ball thingy starts coming down.\n\nBard's ult will never match the plays of a good Katarina ult, tho.
