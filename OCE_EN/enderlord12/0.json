Is it like Runic Shieldwhere it spawns when you spawn? Is it like Yasuo's shield where it \"rechrages\" as he moves (or some other factor)... etc.\n- His base mana is wayyyyy to high. The highest base mana currently is Janna with 410. His super high base mana is not acting upon his gameplay in any unique way... unless there is an explanation behind it perhaps??\n- Ursameggadon's Q... upon getting the second point it gets a damage increase of 80... which means you give it a 200% increase from the first point. Was this intentional? Also, it's cooldown is too long/ damage is too little for his primary damage source.\n- His E is OP O_O.\n- Mebe you could elaborate more? How long does like spire last? Is his Q a skillshot or not? How long's the stun? What is his main role/ build strategy? You get the idea.\n\nOther than that I love ur idea! It's always good look at other summoner's ideas. It's what makes the game interesting, even while your not playing :D. Just elaborate more on your info (add your base stats: health, mana, health regen, etc.) and I'm sure you will be fine! \n\nPeace out {{summoner:31}}","replies":[{"poster":"Enderlord12","date":"2014-12-11T22:41:57.911+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Very well, I'll add mroe onto the initial point, and buff the E, and the Q ;3","replies":[]}]}]}
