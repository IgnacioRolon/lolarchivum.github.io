But to the remaining 90% of people, who are in Gold, Silver and Bronze, most of these things seem Absurd.\r\n\r\nFor example, I was playing Mundo in top lane, against a Quinn, at first, I thought i could sustain and tank the early game poke, What a mistake that was, the second, she hits with her passive, around 300-500 of my health was gone, at lvl 2, 3 and 4. How many champions, can you tell me, can safely lane against and make even, or heck even beat a quinn, because Tanks seem out of the question, adc&#039;s is more or less universally accepted by most people i&#039;ve met and talked to, and the websites i&#039;ve gone to, and most mages are squishy fucks to begin with.\r\n\r\nI guess mainly, i am making this thread, so people can tell me how the fucking lane against this menace.\r\n\r\nAnd do keep in mind, I did write this right after a game, so i may be a tad salty, but still, around half my health in 1 hit at lvl 3 is kinda stupid.","replies":[{"poster":"Talon12","date":"2015-12-20T09:19:24.398+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"you know the only problem i have with quinn? when that little birdy bitch uses e and it knocks your champ around and your attack goes the other way","replies":[{"poster":"Enderlord12","date":"2015-12-21T07:39:55.557+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"So i'm not the only one who succumbs to that bs :/","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"vhumy2001","date":"2015-12-19T10:34:04.489+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Long story short on counter,buy a ranged all-in champ\nKappa Lux,Kat?","replies":[{"poster":"Talon12","date":"2015-12-20T09:18:35.042+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"kat... yeah quinn has her e","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"JasonWazza","date":"2015-12-19T09:42:35.371+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":">I was playing Mundo in top lane, against a Quinn, at first, I thought i could sustain and tank the early game poke, What a mistake that was, the second, she hits with her passive, around 300-500 of my health was gone\n\nI'm Mundo, i go into lane against bird lady, i don't think to farm with Q i fight bird lady, she hurt me.","replies":[]},{"poster":"CHEESYLEEKS","date":"2015-12-20T08:49:37.011+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"urgot top lane... do it.","replies":[]},{"poster":"noogai","date":"2015-12-19T09:38:51.423+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"The key to beating a squishy top laner is not taking a tank, as you need to sustain through early lane phase and buy items. If you get behind, your laner snowballs as you have no innate damage to present a threat to them, and no tank as tanks mostly rely on items, although there are some exceptions *cough* Poppy and garen *cough*.\n\nInstead, the key is to take an equally squishy top lane champ! Champions like yasuo, akali, zed, fizz etc would all do very well against a Quinn. Yasuo has the windwall to block the bird, akali has her W to provide anti-auto attack mechanics and has a buttload of damage at level 6, zed just kills ADC's without hesitation, and fizz is a slippery little fish with a ton of damage.\n\nExperiment in top lane. It's the lane with the single most diverse pool of champions available.","replies":[{"poster":"Enderlord12","date":"2015-12-19T22:54:39.598+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thanks, i think i think i'll try some.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"ViolinMaker53","date":"2015-12-19T15:13:57.711+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"think road kill","replies":[]},{"poster":"ViolinMaker53","date":"2015-12-19T15:13:35.061+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"stalkers blade > quinn\n\nput a little syrup on it","replies":[]}]}
