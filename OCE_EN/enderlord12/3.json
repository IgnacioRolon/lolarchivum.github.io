You, and maybe, maybe one other person on your teams wants to report him, but the rest of your team just leaves Post-game lobby annoyed.\r\n\r\nThen comes the enemy team, they wouldn't report the feeder, as they would of loved the extra xp and gold the feeder provided, infact, they'd be more inclined to honour him then to report him.\r\n\r\nRecently I've seen a video from teaH ocsiD, in which, a enemy morgana players, recognised there was a troll on her enemy team, and the trolls team wants her team to report him, but she replies with \"why thats good for us tho\" in chat. This further points out the painfully obvious flaw in the system.\r\n\r\nPeople just don't use the system when it's needed, and use it out of rage, and trolling.\r\n\r\nI seriously think riot needs to come up with some other form of moderation of the League of Legends Community.\r\n\r\nThank you for reading this, and i hope that you feel the same way as i do when it comes to this issue.","replies":[{"poster":"csm","date":"2014-12-11T06:28:14.098+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"So you run to wolves and zhonyas?
