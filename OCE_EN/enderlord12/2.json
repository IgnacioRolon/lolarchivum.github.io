Though lacking in cc he seems more like a tank more then anything. And a tank without cc is like a full tank build shyv. If he doesn't build tank he will be like swain without the insane ultimate finish his combo. Like I said I like the idea but I still think he needs some changes.","replies":[]},{"poster":"EzeBlood","date":"2015-01-21T21:18:13.256+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I would just like to point out the many faults in this champion concept, starting with the ultimate, and then moving backwards. The ultimate lv 2 is too overpowered. especially given it is the midgame at that point in time. Just think, his team could simply all follow him around, with him giving vision of bushes and the jungle. Anyone they come by would be burst down without any notice. Simply remove the stun and level scaling effects from this ability, and it will be balanced.\n\nThe next fault is in his E. How do we get the different forms of this ability? Through his Q? If that is the case, then the Q active form should be a greater range with lessened damage, due to his increased squishiness.\n\nThe W is fairly balanced, but i think that there should be a passive effect on it, to counteract all the nerfs that I'm forcing upon this champion. The passive could be something as small as spell vamp. 10% at lv 1 and then 20% at lv 5 doesn't make too much of a difference in the early to mid game, and late game, which is where tanks excel, it could be crazy, especially because spell vampirism would scale off any damage that your ultimate deals (due to it being a spell effect that gives you the bonus damage). along with a {{item:3152}} and you would have an extremely sustainable late game tank/mage.\n\nMoving on, it seems as though his Q would be more for ganking bot lane in the mid game than anything. I'm going to leave this unchanged, because it allows counterplay against our 'project'.\n\nFinally, the passive. I know it seems fairly basic, but just think. Due to the new scaling system for health regeneration that is being brought in with season 5, we ought to take into account that for this passive to not be overpowered on an amumu style support in season 5, we would need a minuscule regen buff. It wouldn't require scaling, due to the fact that it's a percentage of max health buff. Even if it was something like 0.5% max health per 5, it would make a difference in teamfights, and still not be overpowered in the early and mid game. The mana regen will be doing the same, so we can keep it simple here too. 0.25% max mana per 5 is plenty, given the original stat you had given equated to around 0.15% at level one.\n\nThanks for reading, if you didn't, tl;dr will be below.\n- EzeBlood -\n\ntl;dr : lots of nerfs, buffs on W and passive to mould him into the tank roule a bit more. You should read more walls of text that have a single picture in them.\n{{item:3070}}{{champion:32}}","replies":[{"poster":"Enderlord12","date":"2015-01-21T22:06:53.123+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I've changed it a bit, I've added the Passive to the W, but no 10-20, I've done 2-12%\n\nalso I've clarified the E and Nerfed the R a bit, Also the stun on the R doesn't affect enemies, it effects yourself. (Self cc)\n\nI also changed the passive to give 2% hp per 5s\n","replies":[]}]}]}
