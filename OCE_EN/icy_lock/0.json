I get disconnected from chat and i'm losing games because of this. Can someone help? or at least explain why this happens only every once in a while.\nHere is a link to what i'm seeing after i disconnect from the game,\nAnd the link it sends me too doesn't help either, i have tried all of them and everything seems fine.\nP.s This lockout of being able to get into the game goes from between locking me out till the end of one game to locking me out for a day.\nthanks for reading\n- Icy Lock","replies":[{"poster":"HORSE OF FORCE","date":"2015-01-19T03:57:08.034+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Have you tried contacting your ISP about this?\n\nIf your games work completely fine out of this 6-9pm period, that's their fault.","replies":[{"poster":"Icy lock","date":"2015-01-21T07:37:18.449+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Will see. thanks","replies":[{"poster":"HORSE OF FORCE","date":"2015-01-21T08:07:34.004+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Do tell what the results are.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"googly4646","date":"2015-01-18T12:48:42.936+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Dude why your are posting advertising links?
