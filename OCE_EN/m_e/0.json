I play too much, so I wanted to start uploading some of my highlights :D. Check out plays by me and against me. Be some of my first likes and subscribes and maybe my videos will show in your feed to entertain you for 30 seconds in the future. Please and Thank You.","replies":[{"poster":"Maraudaur","date":"2014-12-01T03:09:04.727+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey man that's really cool, sick Orianna play! You even have Riot Gehirn in the vid.\n\nI suggest doing a few thing to get more people to watch your vids\n\n* Maybe add some background music to the videos, so its not just game sounds\n* Upload in a higher quality (the videos are a bit pixellated)\n* Have a video auto play when you go to your link. You can adjust your Youtube channel's landing page e.g.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/user/scarraofficial","replies":[{"poster":"XSirCution","date":"2014-12-01T03:32:44.231+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Id suggest adding custom thumbnails as well to make it look more enticing","replies":[{"poster":"M e","date":"2014-12-01T14:39:09.324+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey guys, yeah these are all old clips that I had recorded at various times in various ways experimenting with OBS, Baron Replays and LSI replays. I think I have optimised some OBS settings for better recording quality and am now playing round with movie maker to add music but it seems to distort and worsen the quality. I have made my first GIMP thumbnail for a clip I made today that you can check out! Also I will definitely look in to the auto play options.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"hðnkƒørÇªmíllè","date":"2014-11-30T14:04:55.389+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey have a free subscriber and upvote friend! anything I can do to help I'd be more than obliged.
