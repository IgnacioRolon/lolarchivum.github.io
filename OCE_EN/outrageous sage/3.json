(or at least no loss of LP, demotions, that sort of thing) say for example there was a way to detect someone was feeding intentionally say dying 4 or 5 times in a row within a set amount of time and getting no assists or kills for it. i know i don't have the answer, only suggestions. but i just hate the fact that i am cost divisions in ranked (both demotions and promos) because someone cracked the shits they didn't get what they wanted so fed causing all of us to lose.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Ediwir","date":"2015-05-30T12:46:11.249+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Kind of the same point as with leavers - at which points does it become convenient to start feeding rather than play the game as intended?\nIf the result is just bans and penalties - never.\nIf the result is penalties AND a bonus for the team, well, maybe sometimes it's worth it to just \"take one for the team\".\n\nYou just suggested the best way to have more feeders in the game.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Klavinmour","date":"2015-05-30T12:02:13.633+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Five years people have been asking for this, IT WONT HAPPEN.\n\nIt's a completely abusable concept that wont ever work as intended.","replies":[]},{"poster":"BladeSensual","date":"2015-05-30T10:18:54.459+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"sometimes feeders can b an advantage tho. enemy aims them in teamfights","replies":[]}]}
