I kept getting pulled / stunned and fed like crazy and my team lost. What should the overall strategy be when versing a lane like that?\r\n\r\nShould I be farming under turret and awaiting a gank and poking when I can?\r\n\r\nFurthermore, if my jungler doesn&#039;t want to gank, should I just slowly concede the lane and move on with as few deaths and as much CS as possible?","replies":[{"poster":"≈Å√¶o√±a","date":"2017-05-09T20:08:12.064+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Break it down. \n\n1) Depends on their play style - Aggro= Play safe-farm/more of a passive style, passive= play a little more aggro.\n2) usually tf takes ghost and flash regardless what lane they are in (unless its jg tf) so take that in mind.\n3) Always have your E (sivir) up and enough mana to use the ability- time it perfectly and you will be able to stay in lane.\n4) If the tf is not smart enough - he will use more mana than he can gain (usually occur from playing too aggro) \n5) if the Darius is coming for either you for annie (from a stun) poke whoever does the more damage.\n6) Rush a counter item as a support/ adc. ADC would best rush your usual item.\n7) Talking about #6. If you can't win at the early lining stage then its your best chance to wait it out til mid/late.\n8) Sivir is a strong champ, once you have gotten your first or second item then poke like hell.\n9) A support darius- isn't as strong as a top lane darius and will fall behind if the lane is not won. And they will receive less gold regardless if the supp has the support item.\n10) Annie Support (if your a duo'ing with him) rush zhonyas. Why? armor+ a zhonyas that will determine your life.\n11) A actual adc/supp has literal potential to over-rule the lane so play it safe and request for ganks. (If not- like I said play it safe until mid game).\n\nFarming under tower is not a good thing.  Since the tower is dealing damage to the minions and timing your AA to secure that gold while being under pressure from the enemy laner (usually when they are fed) \n\nHave you heard of the term 'Freezing a lane'. If not then all high elo players does this same thing depending on the situation. The term is self-explanatory but I will explain. It means to hold/freeze a lane in a position where it most benefits you. E.g the minion wave is closer to your tower than theres hence a more beneficial lane and it allows an opportunity for your jg to gank.\n\n(what I said about if the jg doesn't rank then read the list above)\n\nYes, CS as much as possible but don't be greedy and putting yourself into a position where your death is secured. Sivir's W is the best choice to deal damage to the enemy being at a safe distance but think mana wise. Don't use an ability if it doesn't guarantee a result.\n\nAlso about CS, if its a high elo player, they know that you would want the large minion cannon so they position themselves to deal damage on you while you attempt to get that siege minion.  So use your Q for that- make sure its at a health where it can be killed without losing it to the your minions.\n\nPS Get a amor pen. Tho armor pens such as mortal may have been nerfed in the current patch or the next. I don't quite remember.","replies":[{"poster":"FatedSaviour","date":"2017-05-11T02:32:28.008+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"all good points, but, sivir's E requires no mana","replies":[{"poster":"≈Å√¶o√±a","date":"2017-05-16T04:20:22.356+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Ahh yeah thanks, I don't play much sivir or rarely so I also appreciate your input .","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"DeXiongXiong","date":"2017-05-11T22:47:35.407+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Appreciate the detailed feedback!

Don't worry about going oom, because if there is a fight you will lose it anyway, with or without mana, so it's better to stay safe and get as many minions as possible.\n\na lane like TF/Darius, is an off-meta lane, and usually off-meta lanes are feast of famine, either they get completely fed to hell, or they get shat on. You don't have to kill them, but If you can deny them the 'feast' they will become useless later on in the game, due to their lack of a real ADC and a real support.","replies":[{"poster":"DeXiongXiong","date":"2017-05-11T22:48:45.176+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Good stuff.
