Reporting in general does nothing to matchmaking meaning you can get matched with people you've reported. As for reporting for \"unskilled\" it doesn't garentee you wont be matched with the person again, rather it makes them more likely to be matched with people with a slightly lower MMR or who have been reported for unskilled consistently. In fact a person needs to receive multiple \"unskilled\" reports for it to do anything at all.","replies":[{"poster":"DiamondAries","date":"2015-03-30T00:20:25.682+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Well that's just stupid... how the heck are you supposed to save yourself from being matched with the same douche bag that constantly harasses you for \"feeding\" when you are going 0/2/3 as a support?","replies":[]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Riso","date":"2015-03-24T06:48:11.826+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"NAMING AND SHAMING STAHP THIS RIGHT NOW","replies":[]},{"poster":"Homura Akemi","date":"2015-03-23T11:28:09.213+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"summoners drift. what a god","replies":[{"poster":"Jink","date":"2015-03-23T17:01:56.966+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"lmao.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Critical Strike","date":"2015-03-23T14:16:22.756+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Only if he is really hacking","replies":[]},{"poster":"BeerMonster","date":"2015-03-23T12:25:18.019+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"it is not slowed at all from what i saw just smooth consistent motion and able to perform maneuvers it should not normally do","replies":[]},{"poster":"SEKAI","date":"2015-03-23T11:48:20.195+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"He is probably doing the Sion ulti exploit where if he spams taunt and dance (maybe laugh works too) during it, it will slow down the running process significantly, making it possible to do precise maneuvers which is not a trait intended for that skill.\n\nI am not sure how would Riot find if a player is abusing such exploit, but they will get banned if found guilty, not sure if perma though.
