Chests are unrelated to the Honour system, and still based on receiving an S grade as a champion you've not yet received a chest for. Keys can be acquired at the normal rate as long as you are level 2 or above, so you'll be fine as long as you don't get punished.\n\nYou can check the Honour [FAQ](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/115008474148) for more info.","replies":[{"poster":"True Bluè","date":"2017-07-01T14:05:07.734+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I can take keys even if I lose now or not?","replies":[{"poster":"Project Xayah","date":"2017-07-01T14:05:43.875+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"Yep!
