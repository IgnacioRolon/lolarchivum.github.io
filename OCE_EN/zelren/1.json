The sound of fountains and waterfalls balanced his mind. Only six meters separated him from a dirt track where all the yordle citizens carried out their daily tasks. He watched the children run and the adults stroll. It seemed that the Bildgewater assaults didn&#039;t impact them this far out in Bandle City. It was a calm he hadn&#039;t felt in a while. It certainly wasn&#039;t like the forests in Ionia but it felt like home. I&#039;m glad Shen gave me this task even though the threat is so low. Sniffing the air with his small nose once more, he leaped off the ledge quietly onto the path below. &quot;Feels good to be back,&quot; uttered Kennen. \r\n\t&ldquo;But Tristana, it&rsquo;s just a snail! Don&rsquo;t walk away.&rdquo;\r\n\t&ldquo;Just because there&rsquo;s magic all over, it doesn&rsquo;t mean it tastes nice,&rdquo; Tristana said looking back.\r\nTristana studied the purple glowing snail shell in her hand and threw it away, rolling her eyes.\r\n\t&ldquo;I know it doesn&rsquo;t taste nice. It tastes purple,&rdquo; replied Lulu with a wink.\r\n\t&ldquo;I&rsquo;m going home.&rdquo;\r\n\tTristana turned around surprised, looking straight at Kennen crouching on the town square fountain with the snail dangling in his hand.\r\n\t&ldquo;What kind of magic is this? Is it yours?&rdquo; said Kennen, pointing to Lulu.\r\n\t&ldquo;Hey, the snail did most of the work,&rdquo; exclaimed Lulu.\r\n\t&ldquo;Says the one that turned everyone into rabbits,&rdquo; complained Tristana.\r\n\t&ldquo;Pff, most of them were temporary transformations.&rdquo;\r\n\tKennen wasn&rsquo;t listening and showed a relieved but disappointed look on his face. He got off the fountain standing next to the strange pair. &ldquo;Sorry, I thought this was some sort of void magic.&rdquo;\r\n\tTristana smiled, pointing at Kennen. &ldquo;Kevin right?&rdquo;\r\n\tKennen looked more unamused than before.\r\n\t&ldquo;Pretty sure you were the guy that ran so fast ya went all the way up the Placidium&rsquo;s outer wall. That&rsquo;s pretty sweet.&rdquo;\r\n\tTristana looked more pleased than Kennen did about her comment.\r\n\t&ldquo;Sounds like a contestant!&rdquo; sang Lulu.\r\n\t&ldquo;Yeah! You like dares and stuff, right? I bet you&rsquo;re interested in the junk we&rsquo;re doing. Well, we were doing, until you brought in the eating challenges,&rdquo; said Tristana to Lulu&rsquo;s grin.\r\n\tKennen Spoke, &ldquo;To be honest&mdash;&ldquo;\r\n\t&ldquo;He doesn&rsquo;t have the guts!&rdquo; said an unknown voice.\r\n\tTristana smirked, crossing her arms. Out of nowhere, a yordle appeared pushing past Kennen into the group. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s got no drive. No determination,&rdquo; the high pitch yordle said, clenching his fist.\r\n\t&ldquo;Okay, now who are you? Actually, who are any of you?&rdquo;\r\n\t&ldquo;The name&rsquo;s Teemo,&rdquo; replied the recently invisible yordle. Teemo stood there, squinting at Kennen. Tristana broke the awkward silence. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m Tris or Tristana&mdash;whatever ya like friend! And that one&rsquo;s Lulu.&rdquo;\r\n\t&ldquo;Uh huh.&rdquo;\r\n\tKennen noticed Teemo still staring.\r\n\t&ldquo;Ionians...&rdquo; Teemo mumbled.\r\n\t&ldquo;Fine, what&rsquo;s the deal here?&rdquo; said Kennen.\r\n\tLulu jumped. &ldquo;Excellent! Well, Tris and my companions were doing various dares and challenges since this morning. The idea is whoever completes our made up tasks without denying, is the victor. It&rsquo;s my turn to choose the challenge and we&rsquo;re all that&rsquo;s left!&rdquo;\r\n\tTeemo was now strangely and extremely joyful.\r\n\t&ldquo;Because you turned the others into rabbits,&rdquo; grumbled Tristana.\r\n\t&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t worry, I&rsquo;ll go round them up while you guys race.&rdquo;\r\n\t&ldquo;Race? I&rsquo;m the fastest yordle around. Not trying to boast&hellip; but there&rsquo;s a reason I can run up a wall.&rdquo;\r\n\t&ldquo;Well, it&rsquo;s not really a race, more of a retrieval. And Kennen, no abilities, from anyone,&rdquo; said Lulu, looking sternly at Teemo.\r\n\t&ldquo;Wait, what are we retrieving?&rdquo; asked Tristana.\r\n\t&ldquo;Pix!&rdquo; Lulu smiled with Pix sitting on her finger. &ldquo; First one to catch Pix and gets back to me in the grove with all the rabbit victims I transformed, wins the entire game! Because it&rsquo;s almost lunch, oh and Pix is already getting away, aha!&rdquo;\r\n\tKennen turned around to see the glowing Pixie flying off into the crowded markets.\r\n\t&ldquo;See ya!&rdquo; said Tristana, saluting Kennen as she ran off.\r\n\tTeemo was already gone and Lulu stood, beckoning Kennen to join the chase.\r\n\tKennen already made up his mind. This is stupid but, &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s do it!&rdquo;\r\n\r\n\tTristana couldn&rsquo;t see any of her friends in the colourful market crowd, however, the luminous purple glow of Pix was easily seen weaving over and in-between the yordle citizens. Tristana zigzagged past large yordles with delicate plates of food and dodged various stalls selling perfumes and accessories. She side-stepped a plump yordle, right into a hanging rug, bursting out the other side. Stumbling onto the wooden path, she caught up with Pix, only two meters apart. He took a very sharp right, flying up some stairs. Tristana ducked under a man holding a tray of goods and slipped as she turned, trying to grab Pix as he made his way up the hill. Tristana never lost motion, keeping her grip as she stumbled up the wooden stairs. The stairs eventually stopped, leading onto a dirt track. On the left, Tristana could see everyone and everything in the market from her new height. To her right were several of the townhouses; thatched rooves, second floors with wooden support beams, wood exterior and sometimes brick, held with dark timber frames and gardens at the front. The dirt track was a long curve circling the market, which was perfect ground to speed up and catch Tristana&rsquo;s prize. As she ran, the houses stopped, replaced by a stone overhang that lead a waterfall over the top of the dirt track. It was like a tunnel, except the left wall was a flowing waterfall. Tristana had a bounce in her sprint and let her fingers glide through the falling water. She let out a laugh, gaining on the pixie. Soon Pix was just inches from her grasp but she could see Kennen running close behind her. With all the will she could muster, she leapt forward as Pix again took another sharp right. Tristana realised her mistake as the track and waterfall had made the same turn and now Tristana was falling through the waterfall into the markets below.\r\n\r\n\tAs Kennen followed Pix, simply turning down the path, he saw yordles crowding Tristana on a smashed market stall. \r\n\t&ldquo;I might be okay!&rdquo; yelled Tristana, dazed.\r\n\tThe tunnel ended and Kennen made his way through the exit losing sight of Pix.\r\n\tWherever he was, I should be close by. I haven&rsquo;t got much time. Wait&mdash;what&rsquo;s that sound? Sounds like the void tearing itself open.&rdquo;\r\n\tKennen wasn&rsquo;t paying attention and bumped into a really hard object. He fell backward onto the ground inside a tall shadow. It was Shen. \r\n\t&ldquo;I couldn&rsquo;t help realise all the commotion and thought you might need help. I see I was wrong.&rdquo;\r\n\t&ldquo;Sorry Shen, don&rsquo;t worry I&rsquo;ve got this. I mean it won&rsquo;t happen again,&rdquo; replied Kennen.\r\n\tKennen felt something squishy in his pocket. He reached in, pulling out the mangled snail from before. Kennen flung the corpse off his hand, disgusted and embarrassed. \r\n\t&ldquo;At least win,&rdquo; said Shen, flicking Pix at Kennen.\r\n\tKennen quickly caught Pix with his hand.\r\n\t&ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to go check the area,&rdquo; Shen said, walking off.\r\n\tKennen was a little shocked and a little relieved how quick it was over. He was still friends with Shen but he didn&rsquo;t want to disappoint him or the order.\r\n\tKennen got up to have a peek at Pix in his hand. Except Pix wasn&rsquo;t there at all. Puzzled, Kennen began scoping the area just in time to catch a glimpse of Teemo running down the path towards Lulu and the grove with a purple glow in his hand. No way. The final moment approaches, thought Kennen as he ran after him. \r\n\tKennen searched everywhere for Teemo to no avail, only to notice he was already sitting with Lulu and all the rabbits in the lush grove. Kennen grudgingly made his way to join the two.\r\n\t&ldquo;So, where&rsquo;s Pix? You mean you don&rsquo;t have him either?&rdquo; asked Lulu. \r\n\t&ldquo;You mean Teemo doesn&rsquo;t have him?&rdquo; questioned Kennen.\r\n\t&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think you guys get the idea.&rdquo;\r\n\tLulu sighed as she tried another failed retransformation spell on the rabbit in her lap. Kennen realised Teemo didn&rsquo;t have the purple glow anymore.\r\n\tSo where&rsquo;s Pix? wondered Kennen.\r\n\tTristana finally returned all battered up, waving Pix in her hand. &ldquo;Alright, I did it!&rdquo; she said.\r\n\t&ldquo;How&rsquo;d you ... What?&rdquo; Kennen said, confused.\r\n\t&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know! I was coming too from that fall and I just found him in my hand!&rdquo;\r\n\tKennen detected Teemo&rsquo;s pleased expression. As Lulu and Tritana were chatting, Kennen spoke to Teemo, &ldquo;So why&rsquo;d you give it to her?&rdquo;\r\n\t&ldquo;Oh, no real reason ... just accomplishing my plan,&rdquo; Teemo said happily.\r\n\t&ldquo;Plan?&rdquo;\r\n\t&ldquo;Yeah, getting kudos!&rdquo; Teemo let out his high-pitched giggle and rolled around with the rabbits cheerfully.\r\n\t&ldquo;He&rsquo;s serious when the job&rsquo;s at hand but he&rsquo;s a great guy,&rdquo; said Tristana to Kennen.\r\n\tKennen squinted, watching Teemo play with the rabbits. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know Tristana but there&rsquo;s something so genial and... evil about him.&rdquo;","replies":[]}
