I main her. But she is trash. She's in between assassin and a fighter but not good at either. She has 0 escape so what kind of assassin is that. Fighter? Do you build her attack speed for passive? But the rest of her kit doesn't work that well. Her E CC is nothing. If she doesn't get ahead, she's basically useless. You miss your Q on a carry and you're useless.\nSo many things can screw her over. If she gets camped she has nothing else to help the team with. Her W can proc way too slowly also the range is puny. She's not the best at anything. It's hard to play her well even if her kit seems straight forward because she straight up is in an awkward state where she's easily outclassed. She needs a good team comp to do better in but she's so easily to counter.\nRiot really needs to look at her.\nShe needs her E to do something more than pull in the enemy, like maybe pull them in then have a second activation which pushes enemies out. Or give her W more range. Give her more mana pool to survive early farm game? SOMETHING. She's so bad. Yet I still main her.\nLoyal to the grave. {{champion:131}}","replies":[]}]}
