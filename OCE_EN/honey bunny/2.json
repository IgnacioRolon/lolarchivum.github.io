Some people find that being artistic (drawing, painting, sculpting etc) helps them alleviate their frustrations, while others might find physical activities (martial arts in particular, jogging, working out etc) works better for them, perhaps intellectual activities (learning about various subjects, such as physics, astronomy etc) and there are others who find entertainment (reading books, watching movies/shows, playing games etc) helps them release their frustrations.\n\nObviously, the same things isn't going to work for everyone. Personally, I find games to be a reliable release, while I know more than a few people who find intellectual endeavours helps them, as well as a few people who use artistic outlets, but that doesn't mean any of use are \"holding in\" our anger. We release it, just not in the heat of the moment.\n\nThe important distinction here is that there are people who control their behaviours, and people who don't, and for the people who don't, they're held accountable for their actions, just as the ones who initiate the toxicity.\n\nEDIT:\n> Basically you want a PG rated chat.\n\nConsidering the game is rated for an \"audience\" of 13+ years of age, yes, Riot certainly *do* want the game to have a reliable \"PG\" nature.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Honey Bunny","date":"2018-04-11T21:00:34.006+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":3,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=oOMoonLordOo,realm=OCE,application-id=T8eq2lFQ,discussion-id=J1rRohqW,comment-id=000200000000000000000000,timestamp=2018-04-11T08:40:21.200+0000)\n>\n> A tiring respond would be &quot;Fuck you suck&quot;.
