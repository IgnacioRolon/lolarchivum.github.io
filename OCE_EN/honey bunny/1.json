You can review these terms at http://www.leagueoflegends.com/legal/termsofuse\r\n\r\nDue to the severity of this violation, your League of Legends account has been banned until Fri Dec 02 07:21:32 UTC 2016\r\n\r\nIf you have any questions, contact our Player Support team at https://support.leagueoflegends.com/home\r\n\r\nRiot Games Player Support\r\n\r\nLike I have no idea what would have caused this. I only played one game today. At the end of the game the game gave me a message I was banned and to check my Email. That was the message I got.\r\n\r\nIt doesn&#039;t even tell me what supposed action I did to warrant a ban. Anyone else get crap like this?","replies":[{"poster":"PeasentCominThru","date":"2016-11-24T04:52:22.023+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It would 100% be because of Toxicity or AFKing. \n\nThey wouldnt 2 week for account sharing, they would just outright ban it.\n\nIf you really are INNOCENT, then ask for a Riot employee to answer in this forum. \n\nI Look forward to the Chat Log of Flame.","replies":[]},{"poster":"About 9 Kenyans","date":"2016-11-19T02:34:21.111+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Bad luck dude, in my experience it comes down to how many reports you get, like ive been banned before after i carried a game bc my team was toxic and all reported me, and have got people banned for the same kind of thing(ironically) and after i sumbitted requests they just give you a link to their terms and conditions which say they can do whatever they want since they own your account, pretty disgusting from a company so large, but yknow, dems the rules","replies":[]},{"poster":"Erøse","date":"2016-11-18T12:22:12.292+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Message them through\nhttps://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us","replies":[]},{"poster":"Ingénue","date":"2016-11-18T07:33:16.223+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Like the email said, hit [up riot support](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/requests/new). \nIt could be a manual review of player behaviour, and thus not include your chat logs (manual reviews also take a while to come through). \nThey will let you know what your ban was for.","replies":[{"poster":"Honey Bunny","date":"2016-11-18T07:35:33.002+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The link to player support just links to their questions and answers page. No one there to actually answer a question.\n\nI don't curse in game, I always do my best. This is very much out of the blue.\n\nActually, cheers for that, the link you had in your message was much better than the link they had. I put in a ticket.\n\nLOL how can I avoid doing whatever I did, if they don't tell me what I did. And as far as I know, I haven't done anything wrong.","replies":[{"poster":"BarryButcher","date":"2016-11-18T08:58:33.213+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"at the top of the support page it says \"submit a request\"","replies":[]}]}]}]}
