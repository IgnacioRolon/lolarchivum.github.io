Automated Punishments System","subforum":"Player Behaviour","up_votes":2,"down_votes":6,"body":"TL;DR: The punishments system is now automated and is triggered by certain keywords. The system is quite buggy. Players not aware of the new system are being slapped with quite unfair bans, players aware of it are going as far as avoiding chat completely - even as much as avoiding complimenting team mates on good play.\n\n\nThings like \"reported\", \"report\", \"/ff\" among other keywords all trigger the system. Basically if you say anything that could even remotely offend someone and you get reported, this system will be triggered and you WILL receive an auto punishment. The season 1/2/3 days where the players decide who is issued a punishment are over, it's now Riot creating a safe-space to accommodate for the true toxic players - you can no longer call someone an absolute prick for intentionally feeding 15 kills in your promos game as a single report results in an automated punishment for this. There's no more player reviewing your case pardoning it because of the fact the player you called a prick is indeed a prick. Just thought I'd post warning you all.\n\n\n\n**Info about the system + some flaws explained:**\n\n> In a thread on the League of Legends forums, Riot Lead Designer of Social Systems Jeffrey Lin goes into a little more detail on the machine learning behind the automated system. The system tries to learn which phrases frequently lead to player reports, rather than just looking at an assigned \"bad word\" list, Lin writes. \"Every report and honor in the game is teaching the system about behaviors and what looks OK or not OK, so the system continuously learns over time,\" he writes. \"If a player shows excessive hate speech (homophobia, sexism, racism, death threats, so on) the system might hand out a permanent ban to the player for just one game. But, this is pretty rare!\"\n\nThis all sounds good at first glance - a system which teaches its self what is and isn't okay. The problem with this, a fair few reports are submitted by kids falsely. We've all seen that guy who's an absolute prick and steals your lane (even with the new dyno system) or doesn't get the champion he wants so just outright trolls, then after the game reports you for calling him a prick. It happens countless times. I'm sure every single person here has at least once been reported by such a player. This is just a SINGLE flaw of the system.\nBeyond this there's the flaws which I briefly point out in the first paragraph of this post, things like \"reported\", \"ff\" and \"report\" all trigger the system. Sure, these **are** things toxic players say quite often, though non-toxic players may also say them as well. I don't believe a player should be punished simply for asking his team if they wanna FF a normal game because they're not feeling up to continuing with it, or for asking the enemy team if they can kindly throw a report on the full movement speed Rammus running straight down mid lane feeding. Even worse, I had an account receive a punishment for calling A FRIEND OF MINE a 'bronzie' (\"bronzie xd\") after they stuffed up a play. I was on Skype with the friend at the time and they laughed about it, it was another player which reported me for it. I assume (with this in mind) 'bronzie' is also a triggerword for the system, as many actual toxic players are reported for it.\n\n> Lin writes on the forums that Player Support representatives previously \"saw false positive rates in the 1 in 6000 range. So, we know the system isn't perfect, but we think the accuracy is good enough to launch.\"\nYou're training an AI based on a 1/6000 inaccuracy as \"accurate enough\"? Are you joking? Also, we all know this figure is absolutely bullcrap. I've had countless games (mainly on lower elo accounts) where I'll receive a report (or have some say they're reporting me in the after game lobby) simply because my score wasn't as good as it may have should been, despite me still trying. Usually in such cases (or the majority of) I haven't said a word all game. Let's say in such a situation I said something unique in a few of these games, maybe something like 'tr' (I use it as \"their red\") and suddenly (due to it being say 10+ reports with this keyword) 'tr' becomes a trigger word. 1/6000 isn't accurate enough, though the true figure of ~1/10 is even worse.\n\nAnother **MAJOR** flaw with the system is the fact it does not review ANYONE elses messages. You could simply be innocently replying to someone and if your reply contains keywords/phrases, you're risking receiving a punishment. This is the main flaw which is seen the most, even the reform cards sent out include no chat logs beyond your own - there's no context at all actually reviewed by a human or the system. The tribunal more fairly took factors of context into the judgement.\n\n\n**Other various problems+etc:**\n>I really think this is going down the wrong path. Having it weight the words said differently isn't a positive feature. Vocabulary doesn't efficiently correlate to negativity, and often the most innocuous words are the most negative. Gg easy is far more infuriating and negative than getting called a %%% ever was. \n\nAs stated here by a player commenting about the system, having different weighting on certain words is also a very risky and (so far proven to be) invalid feature. It's quite simply proven that the context of words matters heavily, rather than which words are actually used. As an example \"gg\" is no where near as bad as \"gg scrubs\", though as 'scrubs' isn't reported often, it's not weighted as much. Then there's things like mentioned above, calling someone a '%%%' in an online game means nothing to anyone, though saying \"gg easy\" is actually considered (by most players) unsportsmanlike and, well, annoying.\n\n>Alright, guess I'm not ever gonna congratulate my ezreals anymore in case the system thinks I'm being toxic.\n\nAs mentioned here by another person discussing the system, sarcasm is (obviously) not understood by the system. \"gj ez\" after he gets a pentakill is no different to \"great job ez! :D\" after he dies. This player is then literally feeling as if it's risky to congratulate their team on playing well as it may trigger the system.\n\n>Part of the problem is that it's far too easy to report, people don't consider reporting a big deal (on either side: reported or reportee) and so it becomes a weapon against people you didn't like. That's a big deal when it is a system meant for serious offenses and excessive behaviors.\n\nAs mentioned here, reports are now being used as a weapon. Dislike someone? Report them. Someone didn't carry you? Report them. It's quite likely that the players you report will receive at least a chat restriction, even if they say nothing that actually offends anyone. Now I know the response here is gonna be \"if someone WANTS to report you, then you deserve to be reported\" - true in some cases. Though we've all being in the situation where you call (or get in ranked) a lane and someone else is going that lane no matter what, then they're an absolute %%%% to you and ruin your game. After the game they throw a report on you for not backing down and giving them the lane, then you receive a punishment for saying \"ffs _\", \"report _\", \"ffs gg\", or whatever it may be. This is when the 'report' button is used immaturely as a weapon and is actually seen quite often.\n\n>My question is this; I've seen people get reported for nothing just because a single player/duo didn't like the person and he got a warning or he was indeed punished. Will this rectify that? Because tribunal was the bomb-diggity. Players actually got in trouble for serious things and the fake reports weren't even able to bypass the troll players.\n\nThis kinda sums it up again, the system's being used by immature persons as a weapon. If they don't like someone or someone does something which annoys them, they simply report them. The tribunal (player-run punishments) was quite well-off at filtering what was and wasn't a legit report. If there's some feeding idiot in your game and they assumed it was that idiot who reported you, the tribunal would usually completely pardon the case - the new automated system doesn't factor this in at all. The resulting factor is you using the chat AT ALL is risking your account if someone who dislikes you (be it due to you not carrying them or having a playstyle which differs to theirs) reports you.\n\n>Is there going to be anyway a player who has be banned or perma-banned can contest the decision. I mean what if other players are antagonizing you and goading you into a fight. what if they report you, but you don't report them because you are a mature player who knows that the drivel of someone you don't know means nothing to you, but you get banned. Is that fair? By being the bigger person and not reporting someone, but some immature little kid wants to be an asshole and reports you.\n\nAnother player summing it up quite well. We've all had those little BM matches in-game before (esp. on oce), only to find out the enemy player has reported you (usually after losing, not so much when they win) due to them beginning to take it more serious as the game progresses. This isn't overly fair if one player is punished while the other (also involved in the BM) isn't as one decides to be mature and not use the report system as a weapon, rather reserving it for when player(s) are actually making the gaming experience poorer for others.\n\n>How does the system differentiate between joking/actual toxic behavior?\n\nThis received no reply. The players are quite clearly concerned about having an automated system (we all loved the old tribunal system) and want answers - answers they're simply not getting at this stage. Riot seriously needs to step up a little here.","replies":[{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2016-04-18T03:55:43.001+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"> TL;DR: The punishments system is now automated\n\nOCE has never had tribunal, we have ALWAYS operated under an automated system. The system was revamped and is more effective than ever (and more effective than old tribunal in most cases in other regions for now). I addressed the state of tribunal on your other post [HERE](http://boards.oce.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/player-behaviour/ecu5nzgG-oce-tribunal?comment=00020000). Please read that first if you haven't already, because a lot of what I say about the automated system relies on you understanding that tribunal is coming back very soon.\n\nNot all cases are handled by the automated system either. Real people do look at these cases and the system is monitored constantly to ensure accuracy.\n\n>  is triggered by certain keywords\n\nNot the case. The system flags certain keywords, but does not punish based solely on them. The system is better at context than you might think. It has your history, the historical accuracy of those reporting and more other statistics than a person could realistically consider to look at.\n\n> The system is quite buggy. Players not aware of the new system are being slapped with quite unfair bans, players aware of it are going as far as avoiding chat completely - even as much as avoiding complimenting team mates on good play.\n\nThere is frankly zero evidence of this. Every system has it's flaws certainly, but I personally have yet to see a case of someone punished unjustly, and have heard of only one and the stats that Riot has given us reflect this. As for people avoiding punishment, the system is tuned relatively conservatively specifically to prevent those false positives. This doesn't mean people go unpunished, it means some may take longer to receive punishments than others.\n\n> Things like \"reported\", \"report\", \"/ff\" among other keywords all trigger the system.\n\nOnly in the presence of other negative behaviour worthy of a punishment.\n\n>  Basically if you say anything that could even remotely offend someone and you get reported, this system will be triggered and you WILL receive an auto punishment.\n\nA report DOES NOT equal a punishment. Only a valid report will trigger a punishment, and you will NEVER be punished for a first offence except in incredibly extreme cases.\n\n> The season 1/2/3 days where the players decide who is issued a punishment are over,\n\nThe players do decide. The system does not do anything without reports. If the players choose to report it means they have deemed the behaviour inappropriate. If the system deems the report valid then it will trigger. It is still very much the players deciding what to punish, the system only acts on those decisions.\n\n>  it's now Riot creating a safe-space to accommodate for the true toxic players - you can no longer call someone an absolute prick for intentionally feeding 15 kills in your promos game as a single report results in an automated punishment for this. There's no more player reviewing your case pardoning it because of the fact the player you called a prick is indeed a prick. Just thought I'd post warning you all.\n\nSimple philosophy, don't be a jerk. You're saying you've never had a REALLY bad game? Would you enjoy being abused for having a bad game? If it's intentionally feeding, report it, it will be punished, you abusing them isn't going to make any difference to them, only make the experience worse for the rest of your team. And if it isn't intentionally feeding, then congratulations you're an ass. What does being toxic here accomplish? It's not going to make them play better.\n\nRetaliation is also not accepted. Defending yourself against verbal abuse is one thing (though rarely effective) and won't be punished, but responding to toxicity with \"kys you worthless piece of sh*t\" is not ok. So yes, retaliating in an abusive fashion WILL get you punished.\n\n> The problem with this, a fair few reports are submitted by kids falsely.\n\nThe system understands false reports and throws them out. You will not be punished for a false report.\n\n>  then after the game reports you for calling him a prick.\n\nSee above. Defence is fine, retaliating with abuse is not.\n\n> Even worse, I had an account receive a punishment for calling A FRIEND OF MINE a 'bronzie' (\"bronzie xd\") after they stuffed up a play. I was on Skype with the friend at the time and they laughed about it, it was another player which reported me for it.\n\nThen why not say it in Skype? This alone would not trigger a punishment, reported or not.\n\n> Another MAJOR flaw with the system is the fact it does not review ANYONE elses messages. \n\nYes. It does. You only receive YOUR chat logs in reform cards because you need to look at YOUR OWN behaviour. You are the only one you can control, thus it is YOUR responsibility to watch your actions. Just because you were punished does not mean they weren't.\n\n> Then there's things like mentioned above, calling someone a '%%%' in an online game means nothing to anyone, though saying \"gg easy\" is actually considered (by most players) unsportsmanlike and, well, annoying.\n\nDifferent things have different meanings for different people. If a behaviour is reported, and the report is not false, then it is pretty safe to say that someone deemed the behaviour negative. One word/phrase will not get you punished, and certainly not for a first offence. Those who are punished are consistently toxic. Take a look at some of the threads on these boards of those who have been permanently banned. Some of them post chat logs, and they are all worthy of the punishment they received.\n\n> As mentioned here, reports are now being used as a weapon. Dislike someone? Report them. Someone didn't carry you? Report them.\n\nIf you do this your report accuracy will be though the floor and the system will barely even consider your reports. The system weights a players reports based on their accuracy. Reports like these will be thrown out.\n\n> This kinda sums it up again...\n\nI'm just gonna go ahead and say you aren't exactly using reliable sources. Where is their proof of this? and where is yours for any of your claims? It seems to me that you are speaking from a perspective based on hearsay and rumours with no actual evidence since you have yet to offer any. It makes it very difficult to really take anything you have to say into serious consideration.\n\n> Is there going to be anyway a player who has be banned or perma-banned can contest the decision.\n\nThere is. You can submit a support ticket to appeal the ban. That said if you've made it as far as a perma ban it's unlikely the punishment was false. The system typically punishes in four tiers.\n- 10 game chat restriction\n- 25 game chat restriction\n- 14 day ban\n- Perma ban\nIf you've been consistently been demonstrating negative behaviour to the point of receiving a perma ban that it is phenomenally unlikely the punishment was made in error.\n\n> This isn't overly fair if one player is punished while the other (also involved in the BM) isn't as one decides to be mature and not use the report system as a weapon, rather reserving it for when player(s) are actually making the gaming experience poorer for others.\n\nAgain, where is your evidence that this has EVER happened? As an emissary I have extensive exposure to the systems and their workings and I have NEVER seen or even heard of a false case like this. I don't pretend to know everything, but you speak as if this happens a lot, and just saying it doesn't make it so. Do forgive me for being sceptical when I see how the system works every day and you haven't offered anything to actually contest that.\n\n> How does the system differentiate between joking/actual toxic behavior?\n\nContext. Did the player it was directed at report? Are they queued together? Have they played together before? What was the 'targets' response. It's usually pretty obvious when it's a premade joking around. Joke negativity very rarely gets reported, and does not get punished.\n\n> Riot seriously needs to step up a little here.\n\nAnd what actually makes you think that? Some comments on a thread about tribunal being removed? Most of those comments seem like they were made way back when the new system was first introduced to the other regions, and all of those comments are based on conjecture of what MIGHT happen with a new system. Time and exposure to the system has proved that thankfully none of those concerns are founded. So why are you bringing them up now?\n\nI'll leave you with links to how the system actually functions, more on the Tribunal can be found in my response to your other post.\n\n**Player Behaviour FAQ:** http://boards.oce.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/announcements/L65wrRYe-player-behaviour-faq-updated-for-instant-feedback\n**How do reports work?:** http://na.leagueoflegends.com/en/news/game-updates/player-behavior/reports-how-do-they-work\n**What is and isn't reportable/punishable:** https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752884-Reporting-a-Player#h1q1\n**An excellent post on Cyber Bullying by a member of the community:** http://boards.oce.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/miscellaneous/lM1zpcAN-cyber-bullying?comment=0006000000000000\n**False Reports:** http://forums.na.leagueoflegends.com/board/showthread.php?t=4737274&page=13#post48926281","replies":[{"poster":"Dyl","date":"2016-04-18T19:25:14.151+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"You've missed a lot of information here, the first inaccuracy is how manipulated it is by the report system being used as a weapon (we ALL know this DOES happen) and secondly the fact you can't appeal the WEIGHTING of various evidence in reform cards. Many find they've skipped various levels of bans, resulting usually (most commonly) in an instant 14 day temp ban, rather than chat restrictions. The weighting of this is unappealable, which is what outlines the biggest problem. \n\nTo explain it better, there's two separate systems at play here, the first which checks the report's even legitimate and then a second (if it's legitimate) which weights the report. The weighting system is based on a set of keyphrases which other players are often reported (and possibly punished) for. The result is invalid weightings where some players are being banned instantly when in reality most players would just say they've had an off day and only deserve a chat restriction. The first system which checks if the reports are valid or not is what Riot is calling accurate - which I'd assume is true, to the 1/6000 figure stated. What's inaccurate is then the second system which weights the toxicity of the player and (as a result) if they're punished or if the case is instead simply added to their record. If punished, the system also has the power to INSTANTLY issue 14 day bans. These instantly issued bans are reserved for players which use keyphrases that many many players have reported others for using in the past. The problem is the majority of multi reports in a single game aren't overly for major toxicity, rather it's just because you've pissed off a 4man premade and they're all gonna report you for it. \n\nThe link to the Player Behaviour FAQ is a post by Sephyre copy-pasting public information about the system. Beyond that copied information he doesn't really say much about it, also some of the information contradicts other facts stated elsewhere. Lyte's post about the 'new' system is far more upto date.\n\nThe 'how do reports work' isn't up to date. \"Report a Summoner for not focusing on the team aspect of the game\", reporting a summoner for refusing to communicate or for not working as a team is no longer a report option. This hasn't been an option for months now, if not years.\n\nThe link about 'Cyberbullying' is a little confusing. Everyone in that thread seems to be on different pages when it comes to exactly what they're talking about - some are assuming it's about outright abuse (the kind where you have cancer wished on you for having a bad game), while others are assuming it's just innocent banter they're talking about. Banter is something you will always see in the gaming scene, it's as simple as that. **Especially** on the Oceanic scene. If someone's getting worked up over banter, then they're taking both the game and the chat a little too serious. This is part of where the confusion comes from and why the system's going down a really dark path, some players are reporting others for mild banter because they've taken it a little too serious. while the majority are absolutely fine with it. It's usually \"he said freelo I'm gonna report him that'll show him haha enjoy ban kid\" sort of thought process. Oh and yes, I've had this happen to me personally. The worst part is I was more saying 'freelo' as my team carried the hell out of me - I was **NOT** implying his team played poorly or was 'bad', despite the fact he took it that way. That is a prime example of someone taking things too seriously and the result is the report system being used as a weapon AND them feeling annoyed over the game. Oh and yes, I DID get a 10 game chat restriction JUST for saying 'freelo'. Beyond that it was just discussion with my own team. There was a few comments like 'top's bad we can win', though it was in TEAM chat where it can't actually offend anyone - it was tactical communication on who to target for an easier win and what-not. There was NO other messages in all chat. As it was an ENEMY who stated they reported me (implying they were the only one offended) it's a little shitty receiving a chat restriction for offending someone by saying 'freelo' when it's THEIR OWN fault they took it out of context. I believe this is what most people are saying when they say some people need to toughen up a little, I don't believe they're saying you should put up with abuse simply because it's an online game.\n\nEdit: Also note this example above outlines the problem a little more. I was banned simply for saying 'freelo' in all chat and a few messages like 'we can win top's bad' in team chat. These are both phrases which a toxic player would indeed say, though as I said 'top's bad' about the ENEMY top in TEAM CHAT it's actually a positive thing - it's me communicating with my team so we can win in a more tactical manner by playing around the skill levels of the various enemy players. Beyond this I believe there was only a message along the lines of \"wtf annie just missed her flash ult LMFAO\", though once again, only in team chat about an ENEMY player - and once again it's more communicating that annie's flash and ult is down. Basically the enemy player was highly offended that I said 'freelo' (despite the fact i did get carried by my team, so it was kinda freelo) and proceeded to use the report system as a weapon, resulting in me getting a punishment for sending messages to my team mates. Messages which my teams mates probably actually appreciated, as it was both encouraging and vital strategic communication.","replies":[{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2016-04-19T10:21:34.404+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":">  the report system being used as a weapon (we ALL know this DOES happen) \n\n**Do we? **\n\nI've never encountered this, nor do I know anyone who has encountered this. Nor have I seen any mention of it on boards, and boards are the place people would come to discuss that sort of thing. So the conclusion I draw from that is...so what if they are? Clearly people aren't being punished for it, or if they are being punished for it unfairly, it is rare and handled quickly and relatively painlessly by a support ticket.\n\n> the fact you can't appeal the WEIGHTING of various evidence in reform cards\n\n**Can't you? **\n\nYou can appeal the weighting, same way as you appeal a punishment. There are three major reasons punishment tiers will be skipped. 3rd party/scripting/hacking punishments are instant perma, intent feeding punishments jump straight to 14 day (what is a chat restriction going to do to an intent feeder?), and sever cases like hate speech and death threats will escalate as well, skipping between one or all three temp punishment tiers depending on the severity.\n\n> The weighting system is based on a set of keyphrases which other players are often reported (and possibly punished) for.\n\n**Not wrong, but only half true. **\n\nYou can believe me or not, but the system does understand context, just from a statistics/machine reasoning standpoint rather than a human emotion/logic standpoint. It isn't based solely on keywords, it depends on the reported player's history and the reportee player's history largely as well. Someone with a history of toxicity will be judged more harshly than someone who does not.\n\n> The result is invalid weightings where some players are being banned instantly when in reality most players would just say they've had an off day and only deserve a chat restriction.\n\n**Have they just had an off day though? **\n\nExcept in VERY extreme cases you will never face ANY punishment for a first offense. If someone is punished, it is because they have a realtively substantial history of negative behaviour, and have continued to demonstrate it, not because they just had an off day. We've all had off days, yet we haven't all been banned.\n\n> These instantly issued bans are reserved for players which use keyphrases that many many players have reported others for using in the past.\n\n**Where exactly are you getting this fact from?**\n\nThis is not how the system works, only a part of how it works, where is this information you are accepting as so reliable? The system in fact has the power to instantly issue perma bans, not just 14 day, but it still isn't based on keyphrases.\n\n> The problem is the majority of multi reports in a single game aren't overly for major toxicity, rather it's just because you've pissed off a 4man premade and they're all gonna report you for it.\n\n**Are you just assuming this just because 4>1?**\n\nThe system knows the difference between premades and not, and also knows the difference between false reports and true ones, so having a 4 man premade report you is irrelevant if you haven't done anything wrong.\n\nhttps://ask.fm/RiotLyte/answers/133759089858  < see point 3\n\n> reporting a summoner for refusing to communicate or for not working as a team is no longer a report option.\n\n**Does it not qualify as \"Unsportsmanlike Behaviour\"?**\n\nIt is still an option, just under a different name. Old yes, and using some outdated terminology but the points still stand. Since you've been around since early times and already know everything in the PB FAQ I think it's safe to assume you know _**why**_ something is reportable right?\n\n> If someone's getting worked up over banter, then they're taking both the game and the chat a little too serious.\n\n**But is it banter to them?**\n\nIf the context is in your head, you can't expect a _**stranger **_ to understand it. A stranger that may have had NONE of the same experiences as you. You may jokingly call them a bronzie after they make a mistake, but if there is already a negative precedent in the game, or if you haven't created a positive one, then why would they assume it's a joke? They wouldn't. Having a fun time with your friends is one thing, but a stranger on the internet doesn't have the social context that friends do, and may very well assume that a 'joke' insult isn't a joke. \n\nI'm gonna point you to HeartVine's comment below for that one.\n\"It seems to me you don't truly comprehend the effects abuse (and even \"friendly banter\") can have on the people you get randomly matched with in-game.\"\n\nAs for the context of the cyberbullying post, I linked it because it is self explaining, it does not require the context of the thread to be relevant. It speaks of perception, and how different people see things differently, and that abuse can severely affect the mental development in children (remember the age range for this game is 13+) and can severely affect adults with other...shall we say inhibitions like depression or anxiety (which are FAR more common than you might think).\n\n> Oh and yes, I DID get a 10 game chat restriction JUST for saying 'freelo'\n\n**Care to post the reform card?**\n\nRemember that a report is irrelevant if it is a false report. If that was truly the case then it would be one of the extremely rare false punishments, and appealing it would have had the punishment lifted.\n\n> when they say some people need to toughen up a little, I don't believe they're saying you should put up with abuse simply because it's an online game.\n\n**Does that not depend on who's saying it?**\n\nI agree, some people take things too seriously. Some people forget it's a game and not real life, that there are no real responsibilities other than to not be an ass. That said, there are plenty of those on the other end, who think that abuse is \"part of gaming culture\" and that people need to grow up. But if they think that abuse is ok just because it's online implies that they themselves have not 'grown up'.\n\nMoreover, just because someone CAN take abuse, doesn't mean they SHOULD.\n\n___\n\nYou keep stating all this information as fact and yet have yet to show any evidence, so forgive me for being sceptical. I haven't seen any evidence in my dealings with the system that would back your claims. Your reform card from when you got the 25 game chat restriction would be very useful to have in any case. If nothing else it offers perspective.","replies":[{"poster":"Dyl","date":"2016-04-19T22:25:46.206+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"Are you being ignorant or..?

I know multiple people who will vouch against this.\n\n**You can believe me or not, but the system does understand context, just from a statistics/machine reasoning standpoint rather than a human emotion/logic standpoint**\nhttp://www.theverge.com/2016/3/24/11297050/tay-microsoft-chatbot-racist i don't really need to say more. The  outcome  of feeding a bot invalid values are insane.\n\n**Does it not qualify as \"Unsportsmanlike Behaviour\"?**\nReporting them for 'unsportsmanlike' wouldn't really trigger the system as there's no real chat logs if they're refusing to communicate or work as a team - I'm talking more the players who think they're God and just refuse to work with anyone at all.\n\n**...and also knows the difference between false reports and true ones**\nI commented about this already - the weighting is more a problem if it's \"false or true\". There's a lot of mild chat which I believe the majority of league players will agree shouldn't be punished for, even if it is over many games. We seen with the tribunal the amount of things people got away with. Though I believe the tribunal was a little too weak with what it punished, I believe this system is now far too harsh.\n\n\ntl;dr of what i'm overall tryna say:\nLeague has become a safe-space when it once was a game where what is and isn't allowed was chosen by players, not chosen by an authority or due to the fact it may offend little billy, despite the fact billy's not even in your game and may never come across you. That value shift I believe is ignoring players a far bit. I'm arguing this in the wrong place though as it seems most of the forum supports the idea of a safe-space on League, where if it offends someone you can be banned for it - no matter if they should be offended by it or not.","replies":[{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2016-04-20T09:39:37.911+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"> Are you being ignorant or..? I think every single League player has seen or at least heard about a player claiming they're going to report you simply because they didn't get the lane they wanted and you wouldn't back down to let them have it \n\nWell aside form the obvious that it doesn't mean they'll actually report you, but I also said \"so what if they are?\". You are correct in that my role is rarely contested, but that's not really the point. If you falsely report someone because you just don't like them then the only one you are hurting is yourself. False reports are irrelevant, they are thrown out. No-one is punished because of reports like that (except in the case of serial false reporters, the reporters themselves) so I don't see what the problem is.\n\n> The post about the new system lol...\n\nThe way it is worded is to emphasise the fact that things like racial/homophobic slurs and death threats just won't fly. That doesn't mean the system punishes solely on keyphrases, which is what you have stated in both of your previous posts. It does not.\n\n> No you can not. If you receive a 14day insta ban (skipping chat restrictions) unfairly contacting support results in a generic reply along the lines of \"you were toxic therefore we can't do anything about it\".\n\nYou will receive that response regardless of whether you have skipped tiers if the punishment was not made in error. If you receive that response it is because the punishment has been confirmed and your appeal has been denied. You CAN appeal the weighting of a ban, but if you've been escalated a tier then it's fairly safe to assume the punishment was warranted, and ticketing support ensures a person has seen the case and still deemed the punishment valid.\n\nIf it's the generic responses you dislike then sorry, but support is incredibly busy, and they do not have the time or the resources to type out a page long essay to everyone who appeals a ban about why their behaviour is deemed unacceptable, that's what the volunteers on the boards are for.\n\n> Source?

Riot's system does not have direct contact, it governs the interactions between players, it doesn't become one of the players. \n\nRiot's system learns in a completely different way, so yes you do need to say more, because the learning methodology is so completely different as to make the chat bot example irrelevant.\n\n> Reporting them for 'unsportsmanlike' wouldn't really trigger the system as there's no real chat logs if they're refusing to communicate or work as a team\n\nWhich does not in any way mean that the system does not understand the behaviour is there. Take a look at this: http://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/player-behavior-moderation/sU5wOfFJ-proof-that-the-automated-system-is-broken?comment=0029\n\nRefusing to communicate and refusing to play as a team is still very much seen by the system, just in a different way. The system sees more than just chat logs.\n\n> I believe this system is now far too harsh.\n\nReally? Like are you legitimately serious here? ALL the punishments I have seen, those on the boards or posted elsewhere have been more than well deserved. If anything the community (the majority of players that you think agree on 'banter' not being punished) seems to think that the system isn't harsh enough, that there are too many people getting away with toxic behaviour.\n\nYou mentioned you were punished for saying only a few lines, yet won't provide the reform card for this 'bs' punishment. You say you have people that can vouch for your statements, so why don't you ask a couple of them to do just that, because frankly the complete lack of evidence to your claims make them very hard to believe,\n\n> where what is and isn't allowed was chosen by players, not chosen by an authority or due to the fact it may offend little billy, despite the fact billy's not even in your game and may never come across you.\n\nIT IS STILL CHOSEN BY PLAYERS. If someone is reporting you it's either for a good reason or a false report, and a false report will be thrown out. There is no magical authority here that tells the report system what to ban and what not to ban, the system learns that by seeing what PLAYERS report for. The only time \"Little Billy\" will ever have any input on your punishment is if you post your chat logs somewhere like boards and he sees and responds to it.\n\nPLAYERS decide whether or not to report. The system does not do anything if there is no report made by a PLAYER.\n\n___\n\nI have said my piece, I have presented my issue. If you can provide me with some evidence to back your claims then I will reconsider my standpoint, but otherwise I will not be responding again, I'm at the point of repeating myself and the discussion is going nowhere.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Project Xayah","date":"2016-04-19T01:09:14.693+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"It seems to me you don't truly comprehend the effects abuse (and even \"friendly banter\") can have on the people you get *randomly* matched with in-game.

It seems most users on the boards are supportive of the idea that league should become a 'safe-space' where if someone says anything that offends you, they're punished for it - even if you shouldn't be offended by it.

I also don't believe players should be fearing losing their account simply for saying something like \"lol nice flash bro\" in a joking sort of manner - this is now (for the most part) what the game has become to. If they become offended, they now have the option to report you and have you punished for a simple comment. The balance between allowing players to feel as if they can actually use the chat how they like (without being outright abusive) and protecting players from feeling at all offended is fairly out of balance right now.","replies":[]}]}
