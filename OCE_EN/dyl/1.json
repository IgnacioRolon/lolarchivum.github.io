{"poster":"Dyl","date":"2015-08-23T16:21:20.415+0000","title":"Player Behavior System, is it working? (not an appeal)","subforum":"Miscellaneous","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Edit: Yeah, this is quite a long post. tl;dr included below the 'essay'. Feel free to discuss/reply.\n\n\nBefore continuing on with reading this thread, as said in the title this is in no way an appeal of any kind. I did get a 14-day ban recently and I understand perfectly why, I was (at least to an extent) toxic. What confused me is how this brand new &#039;smart&#039; system slapped me with a generic auto 14-day ban rather than various other (possibly more effective) options of punishment. I was banned after trying to reason with a toxic player which led to frustration and ultimately toxic comments due to his stubbornness and continued feeding. \n\nI really think there needs to be different punishments on a player-to-player basis rather than generic punishments across the board. I&#039;ve read various articles and it&#039;s my understanding Riot is really big with trying unique/new methods of dealing with player behavior, I&#039;m surprised to see the company then pull out generic punishments. On top of this, chat logs (even if full chat logs are seen by those reviewing cases) don&#039;t tell the story at all. I can admit I myself abused this fact in the past, it&#039;s really disgusting how flawed the system is. If any of the player base reviewing cases (is there still a tribunal?) were actually in the game(s), the outcome of many cases would be very different. I&#039;ve seen it from all angles, even at times it&#039;s me that&#039;s been _that_ kid. We all know the one, that guy who you have an argument with in champ select then once in game he sits in your lane trolling, stealing every CS (attempting to) then spamming laugh when you get engaged on and watching as you die. Now switch views, what&#039;s the tribunal see? The tribunal will see your one comment calling him an asshole after 20-30 minutes of putting up with his toxic in-game (outside of chat) behavior. This comment (as long as it&#039;s not coupled with many other comments) I&#039;m sure in the opinion of the League community is completely justified. To make matters worse, the tribunal (/whoever reviews cases these days) does not see champ select chat; who actually called the lane first or what went on is unknown to report reviewers.  On top of this, punishments need to be selected on a player-to-player basis. Slapping generic punishments on every player won&#039;t really solve much. In my personal case I was less toxic after a 20 game chat-restriction. After the 14-day ban I simply switched accounts, though even without doing so I highly doubt it would&#039;ve changed much. I would&#039;ve came back more frustrated with intentional feeders/trolls and would have verbally abused such players even more. The chat restriction actually worked in my case, it forced me to think before sending toxic messages, something that has since continued even after those 20 games. In the case of someone who intentionally feeds/trolls in-game, a 20 game chat restriction really isn&#039;t going to be that effective; they don&#039;t chat anyway. The punishments need to be different, even if it&#039;s as simple as basing the punishment on what category is listed with the majority of reports.\n\n\nTo summarize, Riot as a company that really takes pride in having an extremely superior player behavior system. There&#039;s workers hired with the sole purpose of working on new methods of dealing with player behavior and the punishment, as well as report processes. Why in the hell is there not punishments on a player-to-player basis yet? Why is there no way for case reviewers to actually have an in-depth understanding of what went on both in the game and in champ select?\n\n**tl;dr:**\n\n1. Tribunal can not see the full story, ever. Champ select messages and in-game behaviors (feeding/getting team mates killed intentionally/bard/tahm/etc) can not be seen. As it&#039;s the community choosing the punishments and what is/isn&#039;t allowed when it comes to behavior, this is something that does need to be shown in one way or another, **some** levels of toxicness/toxic comments can be justified.\n\n2. Punishments need to be selected on a player-to-player basis. Slapping generic punishments on every player won&#039;t really solve much. Banning someone who is spamming nonsense/verbally abusive messages in game really won&#039;t do much. Slapping a 20-game chat restriction on someone who intentionally feeds/trolls in-game though doesn&#039;t talk at all  won&#039;t do anything at all.\n\n\n\n\n**Just a few notes to read before replying (_inb4_):**\n\n1. **x% of players are magically reformed after a temp ban and don&#039;t repeatedly offend.** At the time of that study my account had only ever received a single ban, meaning I was included in that x%. Does this mean I wasn&#039;t toxic? Hell no, back then (at the time of the study/that _tip_ being displayed in game) I was extremely toxic still. I was that kid who would sit in your lane stealing you farm if you did something I disliked.. You could report be, but there was no chat logs to prove it. (this was well over a year or two ago, I&#039;m a lot more mature in game lately)\n\n2. **\"lol you mad ur banned\" etc** Honestly, I&#039;m not mad. I was toxic and this is how Riot chooses to deal with toxic players, I just personally don&#039;t see this method changing anything. In all honesty after I was auto logged out by the ban I instantly switched accounts and continued playing, what&#039;s solved in that? My second account receiving a chat restriction is the only real reason I even started thinking twice before sending a message in chat; it was actually effective. \n\n3. **\"lol ban evader\" etc** It&#039;s completely with-in Riots terms and conditions as well as the summoner code to have a second account and simply switch to it in order to continue playing after a ban. That being said, this does outline yet another flaw in the current player behavior system.\n\n4. **Why were you banned? **Well, here&#039;s the full reasoning I was emailed, though I&#039;m sure the tribunal/chat log reviewers saw more than just this game. This was the game the ban was triggered by.\nhttp://puu.sh/jLETy/0cd3b5163b.jpg\n**Yellow:** Alright sure, this is toxicish. This was about 5minutes in the game, yi went top and was simply q&#039;ing the wave/pushing while I was tryna farm. \n**Red:** Vayne (solo bot due to the Yi) was saying she was going to simply afk at tower because she couldn&#039;t farm anyway.. I stated that wouldn&#039;t help us at all, XP range was (I believe?) increased a fair few patches ago. Sure, she won&#039;t get many CS, but by not AFKing she could easily manage to stay in XP range. After she asked me to gank bot, said I can&#039;t TP as there was no wards (none in river/lane bushes), could try a lane gank after TP to tower or something, but I doubt it would&#039;ve worked.\n**Blue:** We were easily 10k behind at 20 minutes. Bot+top both were odd lanes (2v1/1v2) and mid lost heavy. Our jungler was trying out a new champ and didn&#039;t do too well either. It was only a normal so I assumed we could simply /ff and requeue, was no point to try. Maybe this can be taken out of context and considered toxic on the same level as \"gg /ff@20\" after someone getting firstblooded, though it wasn&#039;t really that case.\n**Light green:** Yi started AFKing because our team didn&#039;t /ff.. Found it kinda funny. lol.\n**Dark green:** Kat (our mid) said (and I quote) \"lol how did top lose 2v1 wtf\". It was kind of sad he even said that, though I thought I would explain there is a difference between a legitimate 2v1 and a Yi hard pushing the lane for no reason, while stealing XP and CS.\nPurple: General game chat.\nPink: Kat continued her toxic comments.\n\n5. **You should&#039;ve simply gave in to the trolls.** Yeah, maybe I should&#039;ve. In the game above I could&#039;ve simply gone make-shift support mode. Fair point. That being said, I really don&#039;t believe we should have to work around in-game (non-chat/messaging) trolls though. This simply outlines another problem, where trolls are so common players literally suggest learning to work around them.","replies":[{"poster":"Maraudaur","date":"2015-08-23T20:27:45.160+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey man,\n\nNice post! Would be happy to discuss if you post a link to your reform card.","replies":[{"poster":"Dyl","date":"2015-08-24T00:01:21.891+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"No reform card link is provided anymore, the system changed a few months back I believe. You simply are now emailed a chat log of your own messages (**only **your own) along with a link to a post about the player behavior system and a few words explaining your punishment. In mine for example it simply explained in the case where a player is responding to a toxic player in a negative/toxic way, both players receive punishments/warnings, which I understand and believe is far. Though, as pointed out in my original post. I believe is slightly flawed as the _other_ toxic player usually avoids chatting. You know, the kind who will spam laugh watching as you die rather than helping you? The tribunal/behavior system is extremely unlikely to punish reports of such players.\n\nJust a side note, I believe there would've surely been more than just this games chat logs in the tribunal case (and/or equivalent in various new systems), though this was the game which triggered the ban, therefore is the chat log I receive via email. The others (I assume) would've been deemed more toxic,  though (and this outlines another flaw) I am left with this simple, less toxic chat log.\n\nAs mentioned in my original post, I'm not appealing the ban in anyway and overall I'm not at all bothered by it (outlining yet another flaw; I'm honestly not at all effected by the temp-ban), rather just pointing out various flaws and suggesting ways Riot can improve their already superior (compared to other games) player behavior system.","replies":[{"poster":"Maraudaur","date":"2015-08-24T05:09:33.032+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey man,\n\nYou should have definitely received a link to your chat logs as well. (URL should begin with \"link.email.riotgames.com/\").\n\nAs for other toxic behaviours you mentioned, we have a bunch of different systems in place right now. You can check them out here - http://boards.oce.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/announcements/L65wrRYe-player-behaviour-faq-updated-for-instant-feedback\n\nI do like punishments you have to play through (chat restrictions, low priority queue). But sometimes a 14 day ban is necessary, the important part is we have sent the player chat logs now so they can learn what is not acceptable in our game.","replies":[]}]}]}]}
