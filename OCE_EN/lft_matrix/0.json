Yes, that's quite a goal but you have to aim high :)\r\nI have experience with tournaments(LAN and online) and challenger ranked 5s. \r\nI have a large champion pool and am willing to learn more. \r\nI enjoy developing strategies, analyzing games and thinking through all the small details that make up the difference between good and great teams.\r\nI have had trouble with communication in past teams but hope that with more practice i can overcome that barrier.\r\nI am not the best mid laner in oceanic but if i have a team with the same ideals as me i can promise that i will try my hardest and dedicate the most time to becoming the best mid laner for my team so that when the time comes they can rely on me and vice versa.\r\nI am free to practice almost all the time. \r\nI dislike giving up, so i almost never surrender, i believe even if you are losing there is always a chance to win or practice to be had.\r\nI have been in a few teams previously but they all shared different goals/priorities so the team wouldn't go very far, I do not want to make the same mistake.\r\n\r\nIf you liked what you read and are looking for a mid laner add my IGN, i am online quite often.","replies":[{"poster":"samoaskuxx","date":"2015-03-11T07:11:48.794+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Synergy Gaming would like to have you as their mid laner. most of the players are in NZ but we could sort out practises eta. pm us on FB or add me in game if you decide to join us :)\n\nhttps://www.facebook.com/pages/Synergy-Gaming/810423799051087","replies":[]},{"poster":"Bribery","date":"2015-01-19T09:48:33.790+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Played with him in r5s and soloq. good mid laner, and a really postive guy even when losing.\n\ngoodluck","replies":[{"poster":"LFT Matrix","date":"2015-01-19T10:22:53.178+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thanks :) I appreciate the comment, i remember vsing you too :)","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"TrashDonnut","date":"2015-01-18T22:03:55.314+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I think i've seen you somewhere...\n\nTHAT'S IT!!\n\nTHE CHAMPIONSHIP RIVEN GUY.","replies":[{"poster":"LFT Matrix","date":"2015-01-19T01:05:45.583+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I don't play riven or own that skin, you may be thinking of someone else :)","replies":[]}]}]}
