If they gave her a windup too i'd definitely agree, but i don't think the Exile's sword is to be considered broken forever just because of that.\n(get it? Riven? Broken sword? Haha.

I'd say just learn to play with it, it doesn't affect her strength that much but it does annoy me just because the animation looks weak now like a breeze rather then a powerful slash.","replies":[]}]}
