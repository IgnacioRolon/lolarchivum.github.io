You can be toxic and still try to win. You can be apologetic and feeding but still trying to win. I'll put up with alot so long as the team is still at least playing together and trying to win.\n\nIn normals, however, since there isn't the pressure of ranked, you don't really have an excuse for being toxic outside of being a bad person.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2018-02-03T07:21:53.328+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":4,"body":"I agree with HeartVine. One person who's doing bad but is positive, you can drag them and the game back. One person who is doing ok/good but is toxic is dragging down the whole rest of the team, even if you yourself mute them. Toxicity snowballs into bad playing and more time spent typing than playing the game. One person not doing so hot just has to play safe and be carried.","replies":[{"poster":"Exarch Leona","date":"2018-02-03T12:50:26.968+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"This is good IN THEORY, but realistically, if you're team mates doing bad (and lets face it, they aint gonna be positive. its just not how it works here) you're not gonna really make a comeback and win. They'll at most score a kill or 2, but its not going to save you when the enemy team is fed af from him playing like absolute trash.

So bad players stay bad when they're abused all the time for being bad.\n\nIf you help them, encourage them, be nice to them, give them ganks, keep them alive to get some assists, they learn and improve, and maybe you won't win this current game, but next time you play a game with that player, they'll be a little bit better. Maybe you still won't win, but if you keep aiding them, maybe the next game you play with them, you will win. They'll know how to play into a losing game better and turn it around for you, rather than getting all depressed because the team is on their back about everything and then popping up that 15 min surrender vote.\n\nFor me, the worst thing is to be the best player on the team.\n**1.** It means your team is shit and you're probably not going to win anyway.\n**2.** it means you won't learn a damn thing, and won't improve much at all.\n**3.** You spend too much time judging other people's actions, not your own, and again, won't improve.\n\nSo if you help the people who are worse than you, and learn from the people who are better than you, not only do you have a much more enjoyable game, but it means that future games will also be more enjoyable, because which each new game, the skill gap will close, making games closer and more interesting to play.","replies":[{"poster":"JasonWazza","date":"2018-02-04T01:59:09.051+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":">(i don't know why they get down voted so much? they are one of the people who do more for this community than anyone, show a little bit of respect please guys.)\n\nI've seen the same argument used on youtube, and i'll give the same counter argument here.\n\nIt's a way someone can show that they don't believe in the opinion presented, sure it's not always the most helpful, but asking people not to dislike things because of them doing more for the community is flawed, and shows that your less wanting other people's opinions and more just want to look good.\n\nNot to mention, using the same argument, Riot would never be down voted even when they are doing something the community doesn't like.","replies":[{"poster":"Project Xayah","date":"2018-02-04T02:42:41.026+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"> shows that your less wanting other people's opinions and more just want to look good.\n\nWhile I more or less agree with the point you're attempting to make, I'd say that's somewhat of a flawed statement. Up/down votes give very little, if anything, in the way of opinion, rather they're used as a measure of agreement. The only real way to give an opinion in this kind of environment, especially one people will consider, is to actually *say/type* something. That, at least, will give people an indication of the specifics of how you view the situation, and they can agree, or disagree, with you wholly, or partially, whereas up/down votes indicate more of a definite view one way or the other (and are typically anonymous).\n\nOff the top of my head, I'd say the word \"agreement\" is more fitting the the context.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2018-02-03T14:29:16.793+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":2,"body":"Maybe it's different in your games, but often I'll be on a team with someone not doing so hot, and one of a few things happens. \n\nMaybe you end up not being able to carry them and you lose, but you've had a positive (or neutral) game and you leave knowing you lost just because the enemy team was better, you can't win every game. \n\nMaybe you support that player with ganks or roams or maybe you can't but you can keep them alive in teamfights at least. They pick up some assists and come back at least a little. They probably won't be winning any 1v1s but they can contribute at least. You end up winning, great job.\n\nOr maybe your jungler messes up a gank top, and the top laner starts abusing them. They're spam pinging, talking shit. At best, the top laner is wasting their time typing, and their lead to tilt. At worst, they drag the jungler into it. Maybe someone else makes a mistake, or tries to defend the jungler, and then they're dragged into it to. Suddenly more than half your team is bogged down in this shitfest of a chat (which you are completely uninvolved in). You lose that game because noone is playing anymore. You'll always lose that game because everyone has given up.\n\nSo yes, I'll take a bad player over a toxic one any day.","replies":[{"poster":"TheDemonEmperor","date":"2018-02-04T01:11:10.141+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"hahahaha you think so? that is the ideal scenario. \n\nLet me tell you how reality is; The feeder gonna farm side lane for the rest of the game, while you keep losing tower to team fights; Eventually baron and the game.  \n\nYou can be nice and hold his hand during the laning phase but once you leave he gonna feed.
