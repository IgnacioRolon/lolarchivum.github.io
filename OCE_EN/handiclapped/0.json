For the smoothest and quickest response possible please adhere to the following guidelines: \n\n>Please create a max of 1 ticket about this issue, and do not try to add any information afterwards/submit multiple as it will bump it to the back of >the queue. It can take up to 7 business days for them to get back to you (although majority of tickets are answered within 48 hours), so be patient\n\nSince it's an account specific inquiry we can't really help you above this, unless you wish to provide chatlogs and have some members of the community help you understand why you got banned and perhaps suggest ways that you improve your behavior.","replies":[]},{"poster":"CHEESYLEEKS","date":"2017-09-23T21:27:51.195+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You sure can have another chance.
