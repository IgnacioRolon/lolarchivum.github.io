Ofc the blitz shouldn't have trolled, but i personally would've dodged and be mad i lost LP for your decision. Teemo can be a good pick,  but only vs a very small amount of very specific champions.\n\nI have a main too, if it gets banned however, i always have 2-3 champs to fall back on (although cho'god is never really banned or picked). I suggest you do the same. Don't tunnelvision yourself by playing just 1-2 champions. Have a backup.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Slowdownn","date":"2016-06-08T09:54:06.185+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Ranked IS TROLL mode","replies":[]},{"poster":"Plutooh","date":"2016-06-08T09:31:21.106+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Get used to it.\n\nRiot doesn't care, as long as you all buy champs and spend money.\n\nSolution, boycott buying RP.","replies":[]}]}
