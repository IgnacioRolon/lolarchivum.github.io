I want to smurf. But I want to smurf with people that are either also smurfs themselves or are down on their luck. I want to add a few people that regularly play ranked but seem to be stuck in Bronze or Silver. People that always get feeders or afks, people that say &quot;Rito Plz&quot;\r\n\r\nI&#039;m here to be the robin hood of elo, and give you guys a break.\r\n\r\nI like to use voice comms - so over 18 preferred because I&#039;m 26 and don&#039;t want to be chatting to 12vies.\r\n\r\nI don&#039;t want to give away my smurf accounts name so I&#039;m not flooded with requests. But if you think you might want to duo/trio with me just reply and tell me a bit about yourself and your IGN and I&#039;ll add you.\r\n\r\nFor example here&#039;s a little about me:-\r\nI like to drink, play games, voice chat and have some laughs and enjoy carrying games. I like to play all roles at low elo but I particularly excel as ADC and mid as they&#039;re my main roles. I&#039;m white, but I like to name myself IKYU so that people think I&#039;m azn think I&#039;m good at this game!","replies":[{"poster":"RelentlessLIVE","date":"2016-04-20T23:17:13.658+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I agree with total virgin about how you need to learn from your mistakes, at the same time, iKyu could teach the low elo players in scrims or non ranked games. Instead of boosting them to a higher level... All the newbees will be just sitting back and watch him carry as their ranks grow... When iKyu is gone that same person will go back down to their original ranked and before you know it quit.\n\nSo morale to the story guys, just do scrims and be a team player and make there on your own, you will feel much better about your achievement.\n\nRead about the glitch that happen to faker i think it was, hacker got into his acc and put him on b5...before you know it during the time riot was fixing his acc faker made almost back up to his normal elo.\n\nwhat this story explained is, everyone gets a bad game but you need to accept your rank instead of saying \" i should be a gold or plat\".\n\nOnce again regardless of who is going to carry you to plat or dia, you will always fall or stay to your according rank, unless you've become bettee that is :).\n\nHope i have achieved something with this post :)","replies":[]},{"poster":"Devils Advocate","date":"2016-04-20T04:07:09.561+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"You're also narcissistic, self centered and a lame wad.

So he wants to drop his elo, or get dropped into a lower bracket and play players with less ranked skill than him... Or boost you to his rankings and watch you get stomped... \n\nIt's not a good play style, its not sportsmanlike and frankly... it's just sad.","replies":[{"poster":"Transcender","date":"2016-04-20T06:35:00.456+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I decimate smurfs like him without a problem.\n\nI always prefer to vs harder opponents, remember ranked is not for fun its competitive for you to get better.","replies":[]},{"poster":"RonyStark","date":"2016-04-20T05:37:44.828+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"but you never play ranked:\nhttp://oce.op.gg/summoner/userName=ToTaLViRGiN","replies":[{"poster":"Devils Advocate","date":"2016-04-20T05:42:49.298+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"I never claimed too, this account is 6weeks old after stopping for near 3 years.
