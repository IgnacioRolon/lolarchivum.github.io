Heavily informed with current metas etc\r\nI&#039;m good at analysing mistakes and learn more with every game I play.\r\n\r\nBeen slacking a bit lately but looking to swing back into league full time again, Main part of motivation loss was having no people to play with everyday, Gets real boring playing alone tends to be less fun, \r\n\r\nMy main support champs are Thresh, Braum, Janna, Annie, Morgana, Alistar, Nami, Tahm and Kennen . I&#039;m looking to start branching into Nautilus, shen and Bard.\r\n\r\nI also play ADC as the roles go hand in hand bot it wasn&#039;t hard to pickup the skillset required as I quite enjoy the role to, My positioning skills are top notch however sometimes without the little calling voice in my ear greed can sometimes get the better of us all :)\r\n\r\nI was a Dota  player since release, And moved onto Dota 2 So I had a good 5 years of practice before League came out. I also occasionally play dota 2 and Heroes of the storm.\r\n\r\nIf you&#039;re interested in having a chat add me ingame on R3demption, Lf serious players only that are interested in moving forward from a casual fun gaming experience to a little more serious and still fun competitive gameplay or you can add me on skype on vallora2\r\n\r\nRegards,","replies":[]}
