There's a difference between dodging because someone is being really toxic in champ select and will probably troll the game, and someone with a tendency to be extremely stubborn when it comes to playing more then one champ in a game that's literally about champion diversity. I guarantee (especially for bronze 5 players) that if you can play at least 2 champions in every lane well, you will climb faster then trying to play eve jungle every single match (or attempting to play her in lane which is retarded).","replies":[{"poster":"She Loves Me","date":"2017-08-28T09:36:42.395+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> I guarantee (especially for bronze 5 players) that if you can play at least 2 champions in every lane well, you will climb faster then trying to play eve jungle every single match\n\nEntirely wrong, If you want to climb it's best to main 1 single role, and if you get autofilled or even secondary role you should dodge. \nFor whatever division you're at, you're there for a reason. - Players in the role you don't main will inevitably be better than you and there's a good chance you will get facerolled/feed - Resulting in a high chance of losing. \n\nDodging = -3 lp\nPlaying off role = +- 14-20LP and this isn't 50/50 every game. \n \nIf it's a meta 1 trick that is banned or frequently picked it will slow your climb but other than that being a 1 trick will make you climb quicker.","replies":[{"poster":"Fitzky","date":"2017-08-28T09:46:05.801+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"How about no, you're wrong :)\n\nYou like that :)","replies":[{"poster":"She Loves Me","date":"2017-08-28T10:36:05.496+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"lol wp","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]}
