However, I would like &#039;Ranked&#039; as a whole to improve.\r\nOver a past couple of days, I&#039;ve had a concerning about of AFK&#039;s and Trolls that ruin the game for 4 others, for a multitude of reasons. Some of these \r\n\r\nReasons include:\r\n- Simply just AFK&#039;ing from Start to Finish.\r\n- Sitting on the Platform in Base and not participating in the game because &#039;Someone damaged their ego&#039; or &#039;They want an apology for someone&#039; (I&#039;ll expand on this point)\r\n- Having no intention to win.\r\n\r\nFor starters, people who AFK from Start to Finish may of D/C&#039;ed and never connected or had something extremely urgent they must attend to, and I guess I can accept that, because maybe them D/C&#039;ing was out of their control or the &#039;Extremely Urgent Matter&#039; was also out of their control. However, I&#039;d like to address specific cases: A individual that AFK&#039;s and had no intention of winning at all since Champion Select. An example of this is in my recent game, in which someone had the &#039;Role: Support&#039; in Ranked Champion Select and they instalock Darius support. Whatever, their&#039;s not a whole lot I can do about that however, they then proceed by letting the game start and never connecting and just AFK&#039;ing. The problem I have with this is that by you picking &#039;Darius as Support&#039; pretty much shows me you had no intention of winning if you never connected to the game. Therefore, as a result I would like them to receive a harsher penalty in ranked. \r\n\r\nExamples of a Harsher Penalty:\r\n- Instant 20m Queue for their next 5 games.\r\n- 1 Day Ban\r\n- New: A ban on ranked for 5 games, that force the player to endure through a minimum of 5 normal games before they can continue ranked.\r\n\r\nThe reasons why I think these punishments would be acceptable would be to help Ranked regain it&#039;s competitiveness and integrity of playing at High Elo specifically, where it should remain highly competitive and not simply be decided by an AFK or Troll that has no intention of winning, and therefore an effort should be made to minimise the impact that these individuals can have on a ranked game, because by AFK&#039;ing or Trolling your deliberately wrecking the rest of the game for 4 others, and causing them to lose LP, in ranked I simply believe this is unacceptable and this issue must be addressed.\r\nFurthermore, I&#039;m writing this post because I feel as if the Report System is lackluster in it&#039;s attempt to punish players that AFK or Troll. Maybe this is because I will never know about the results of reporting someone, maybe AFK&#039;s or trolls at High Elo is so abundant that I don&#039;t notice the 1 out of 10 Afk&#039;s/Trolls that get banned.\r\n\r\nA second example, addressing Point 2 and 3: &quot;Sitting on the Platform in Base and not participating in the game because &#039;Someone damaged their ego&#039; or &#039;They want an apology for someone&#039; and &quot;Having no intention to win.&quot; This example is of a Fizz, who went 3/9 within 20 minutes, I understand sure you have bad games and I can deal with losing because people feed, because someone has to lose every game. However, the fact that we were winning and the &#039;individual that won&#039;t be named because of Forum Rules&#039; then refuses to get carried and simply sit on the platform in base and AFK for 3 minutes at a time, which then resulted in us losing and 4 others who I would say didn&#039;t deserve to lose, got the lost because 1 individual wrecked the game for 4 others and had no intention of winning. Of course, their could be other factors to this case such as did the individual get verbally abused?, No. The simple message that resulted in him AFK&#039;ing and Trolling was, &quot;Fizz play safe, your on tilt&quot;. Now I don&#039;t see at all how this could make someone want to AFK. But I&#039;m finding in High Elo people start to gain some serious ego&#039;s, and when this ego is poked or damaged at the slightest in any way they just AFK and Troll. \r\n\r\nI&#039;m just simply confused to what happened to Ranked being a competitive environment in which every one tries their best to win, I feel as if Ranked especially in High Elo has lost it&#039;s integrity, and simply a majority of players in High Elo no longer care about winning, and no longer care about Ranked being a competitive environment and simply that is why I want to introduce a new punishment for AFK&#039;s and Troll&#039;s in the form of banning them from ranked for &#039;X&quot; number of games. Because not only would this force them to play normals or aram&#039;s, but it would hopefully stop them from AFK&#039;ing in Trolling, because I&#039;ve tend to find those who AFK or Troll don&#039;t believe in the consequences of getting banned etc. and why they continue to AFK and Troll so freely. This Ranked ban would force them to play non-ranked game modes that would then force them to actually play the game, It would also put up a barrier against AFK&#039;ing and Trolling again. Because if they were to AFK or Troll in any of their &#039;Banned Games&#039; then they would be banned from the game either for a day or permanently if their behaviour continues. This would eventually filter the AFK&#039;s and Trolls from ranked and help High Elo, especially regain it&#039;s integrity and competitive environment. \r\n\r\nFurthermore, I would like to discuss player&#039;s reactions to being insulted, taunted etc. I believe to a degree those who are seriously abuse others should get the same treatment as those that AFK or Troll because it is unacceptable to abuse others in such a competitive environment, because then the game snowballs against you,  if the abused individuals isn&#039;t already on tilt, your giving him a big reason to tilt which will most likely lose you the game.  I do understand that you get frustrated and angry but their is a line between having no intention of winning and simply having a bad game. \r\n\r\nHowever, I also believe player&#039;s need to grow up. They need to honestly just focus on their best interest and not the offender&#039;s interest. If they focus on winning the game and shutting out the &#039;abusive individual&#039; from the game the not only will the abused individual get the same punishment as AFK&#039;s and Troll&#039;s. This includes simply muting them. I also believe that if your Ego get&#039;s poked, don&#039;t be a crybaby and ask for an apology. Sure you entitled to one if they have seriously abused you, but an offhand remark certainly isn&#039;t work an &#039;Apology&#039; and you don&#039;t need to be not only tilting your team but wrecking the game for the team because you can&#039;t deal with a little offhand remark is pathetic. I really think player&#039;s should honestly get a slightly thicker skin then they do currently, and at times ignore the offhand remarks, and continue to play the game and focus on their interest. If you were to focus on the &#039;Offender&#039;s Interest&#039; which may result in you AFK&#039;ing or Trolling, not only are you losing and costing yourself LP for example, but also &#039;Getting back at the Offender&#039; does nothing. It just shows how immature and childish you are and gives people reason to ban you and the offender because you therefore had no intention of winning and wreck the game for 3 others on your team. Therefore when you focus on the &#039;Offender&#039;s Interest&#039; your costing yourself, costing three other&#039;s on your team, and achieving nothing against the offender, other than simply losing LP. Because if you instead muted the individual and played the game you would not only achieve your interest, of trying to win and gaining LP, not sabotaging the game for 3 others and showing your the bigger player, you then report the offender and eventually he will be filtered out of the system, I really hope though, especially in ranked Offender&#039;s of all nature, get a much more serious punishment, because especially in High Elo, the integrity of ranked needs to be regained and the competitive nature needs to be exercised, therefore by applying serious punishment to offender&#039;s the integrity and competitive nature of ranked will be uphold as well as filtering offending players from the game. As I suggested early, the ban from ranked on &#039;X&#039; number of games stops players from AFK&#039;ing and Trolling in ranked but also requires them to play normals and for those who only play ranked may see normals as a &#039;Waste of Time&#039; which is essentially giving them a taste of their own medicine, since they waste other&#039;s time by AFK&#039;ing, Trolling and Verbally Abusing.\r\n\r\nI would also like compensation however on the &#039;Innocent Players&#039; part, in which player&#039;s who are stuck with an AFK don&#039;t lose a large amount of LP (Less than 10lp). I am aware of the new &#039;Remake System&#039; coming for people that afk at the start. But players who get an AFK mid game because the &#039;AFK&#039; got his ego poked/damaged shouldn&#039;t suffer as a result of the offender&#039;s actions. I am aware however, how this system could be abused and therefore this system would be someone elaborate to therefore achieve it&#039;s goal of compensating &#039;Innocent Players&#039; that lose as a result to Offenders. An example of this meaning that the AFK or Troll, loses massive amounts of LP (Which could be 80% of the 4 others LP + His own LP Lost (Normal LP Lost for losing a game) would be acceptable with a baseline of 50+ lp lost for AFK&#039;ing or Trolling. However, this doesn&#039;t address players who sit on the platform and have no intention of winning and refusing to play. Therefore a timer should be put into the game hidden from players, without out their knowing of it&#039;s existence that therefore counts how long a player is &#039;AFK for&#039; excluding death. EG: If a player AFK&#039;s for three minutes and then moves around and then repeats till the end of the game, once the Timer gets to &#039;5 Minutes&#039; for example, the compensation should be employed for the 4 other players and the AFK/Troll get&#039;s the 80% of the 4 other&#039;s LP Lost + His own LP Lost. (EG: 10 + 13 + 14 + 17 + 21 = 75lp) Although this is harsh, it should be a deterrent for AFK&#039;s and Trolls. \r\n\r\nWhen I mentioned, that this timer would be &#039;Hidden from Players&#039; and that player&#039;s weren&#039;t aware of this. It was to concern with Premade Teams in the new dynamic queue system so they wouldn&#039;t be able to take advantage of this system. Therefore anyone in a premade should suffer 50% of the Offender&#039;s total lost. Therefore if the Offender in a Premade 4 Afks/Trolls and Loses a total of 70lp, the other 3 should lost 35lp as a deterrent against not only the offender but the premades from abusing this system. I am aware that if this system was to be included in the game it would probably need a lot more improvements and be elaborate etc. But it would ensure that those in Ranked, especially High Elo don&#039;t get punished by people that have no intention of winning etc. \r\n\r\nFInally, I would like Riot to restore the faith in the Report System, where an article is posted or something on the OCE League Client Interface when people Log In, Addressing this issue and making people aware that you will be clamping down on this issue and that people can and will be permanently banned for their repeated offences/actions. Also if Riot was to release &#039;Anonymous Statistics&#039; (&#039;X&#039; people received &#039;X&#039; Punishment (Percentage) this month for &#039;Offence&#039;) and so on, to show people that deliberately wreck the game for others should suffer serious consequences. This would help restore the faith in the Report System by showing players actual results and therefore encourage players to actually report offenders and not just ignore it and try to move on.\r\n\r\nNote; There is no TLDR because I want people that actually care about this matter read through this and contribute their ideas.\r\nNote 2: I&#039;m also opened to further discussion about this issue from all players regarding this discussion and any criticisms or questions about my post.\r\n\r\nThanks for Reading this,\r\n{{champion:103}} Thydah","replies":[{"poster":"trolledallmylife","date":"2016-05-25T21:48:57.929+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Riot will never give a crap as long as they are making money!","replies":[]},{"poster":"ThatsBS","date":"2016-05-22T09:20:38.947+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Is good to know it's not just at low elo.
