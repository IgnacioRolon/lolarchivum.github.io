To clarify, I have a microphone, I just don&#039;t want to use it. I work in-between games, and I prefer to listen to music as it helps me think. I don&#039;t care what rank you are, as long as you&#039;re within two divisions of me (otherwise we cant rank together).  So what are the requirements? I&#039;m quite strict, so I want the following out of you:\r\n\r\n1. A good attitude. I don&#039;t mind a bit of rage, I do it too. It&#039;s natural, this game can be frustrating. The second you act like an asshole, we&#039;re done.\r\n\r\n2. Willing to let mistakes go. I&#039;m not a perfect player. I don&#039;t play enough to care about being a perfect player. But I like playing ranked.\r\n\r\nJust add me on league if you want to duo: ShiftyCake","replies":[{"poster":"DayLight V","date":"2015-12-21T17:04:54.846+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Add me","replies":[]},{"poster":"ViolinMaker53","date":"2015-12-17T11:08:08.032+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"if ur a genuine plat 2 (genuine=my world) then start/only duo with someone you know irl.","replies":[]}]}
