I was wondering if that could be brought into other game modes.\n\nI, personally, would love to be able to do it. It&#039;d be fun I think ^^ Just wondering, anyone else interested? Or has this been discussed before. I apologise if it has.","replies":[{"poster":"Robo23","date":"2015-09-26T04:03:32.643+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"well it seems fun, first time i tried it i was disappointed. Cuz using a skin for one match makes u want it more :( I dont have that much money. Then again i did it to get the ip boost that comes with it.\nSorry bout spelling :)","replies":[{"poster":"Naevia","date":"2015-09-26T04:37:03.280+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"No worries, I can understand you easily ^^ But I spend my money on rp (more then I should :c) and rather then buying a skin, I'd love to just give my team a skin for a game. It's cheap, I could do it often, and it'd be fun.\n\nI understand how playing a skin could make you want it more, but that just furthers my case >:) But seriously, I don't see any real negatives from adding it to all game-modes. Might even be the opposite, and make people more positive :)","replies":[]}]}]}
