She had a feeling deep in her gut,  a bad feeling. It had been twelve hours since she stormed off after Lux had told her about her role as a Star Guardian and she hadn’t made contact with any of them since.\r\nJinx needed time to think, and she wasn’t ready to make a decision yet - but something told her that Lux was in trouble. And she couldn’t just let the feeling go.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, Lux and the rest of the Star Guardians were struggling to hold their own against the powerful Baron Nashor. It was stronger than they predicted, and without Jinx they didn’t have a very good chance. Lux’s prismatic barrier was slowly decreasing, and the Nashor didn’t waste any time in preparing to launch another attack. Lulu, Janna and Poppy all managed to swiftly manoeuvre themselves so that they were out of range, but pain suddenly shot through Lux’s arm and she fell to her knees, unable to move.\r\n\r\nThe smoke from the recent attack was beginning to clear, and the remaining three Star Guardians looked on in horror. Before they had time to react, a massive pink rocket flew out of the smoke at intense speed and continued towards the Baron Nashor. Following that, a multitude of smaller rockets flew and exploded in the same place. The deep green smoke eventually cleared completely, as Lulu, Poppy and Janna looked on apprehensively. The first person they noticed was Lux. She was still on her knees, and had her right arm clutched around her left but other than that, she was unharmed. \r\n\r\n“Jinx…” Lux let out a shaken whisper. \r\n\r\nThe Star Guardians followed Lux’s gaze, and saw that Jinx was floating in the air. Her pink wings were holding her up. and an intense glare was plastered on her face. She pulled out a small pink weapon, and an electric shock shot out of it, critically hitting The Nashor. Jinx shot three more rockets at Baron, and the monster began to crumble. It made a shrieking noise which radiated through the pitch black sky and then it collapsed into a piled heap on the floor.\r\n\r\nJinx stared at the fallen monster for a few moments before shooting another singular rocket at it to be sure it had been defeated. She turned to face Lux, who had picked herself off of the ground. Lux held a radiant, bright smile on her lips and she skipped over to Jinx who was gliding down to the surface. \r\n\r\n“Thank you so much,” Lux’s voice was soft and meaningful as she wrapped her arms around Jinx’s slim figure. Jinx’s froze in the pink haired girl’s grasp.\r\n\r\n“I didn’t come to save you, I was just bored,” Jinx replied nonchalantly, but a smile crept onto her lips.\r\n\r\n“Of course you were,” Lux said and laughed. She stood on her tiptoes and pressed her lips against Jinx’s soft cheek. Jinx frowned, but her entire face turned a strawberry red colour and she looked away almost immediately. \r\nLux smiled to herself, surprised at her confidence. Jinx tried to shuffle away, but Lux only squeezed her arms around the girl. \r\nLulu, Poppy and Janna only looked on with smiles, if anyone could tame Jinx it would be Lux. But only time will tell.","replies":[{"poster":"ZVCKK","date":"2017-03-12T11:34:03.043+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"Nice ship, and a well written story. I personally would up-vote it but I don't recommend submitting this.\nIt's likely to receive flak due to being based off of the star guardian animation. If you apply this writing talent to something a little more original, I'm sure you could win!","replies":[]}]}
