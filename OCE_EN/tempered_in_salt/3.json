I just got back into league and i needed to get some chest because i have 7 keys logged up in the back. Thing is, is that i notice that when i went into collection and hovered over the champs that i had recently played with it says (Thresh and Nocturne to be specific) it says that I had acquired chests for these champions already when i have no recollection of receiving chests. Yes I know the specifics of getting a chest, I haven&#039;t gotten an S- or above as of late but i have had friends whom I&#039;ve played with and gotten S- and above in those games. Is this happening plz halp... and no I&#039;m being honest here, this isn&#039;t a scam to try and get more chests i legitimately have 7 keys with an 8th one almost complete... really wish this think came with a photo upload button{{sticker:zombie-nunu-bummed}}","replies":[{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2017-06-17T07:57:45.809+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yes you will get a chest if a premade earns an S however, the restrictions apply to the champion YOU are playing. I.e if you are playing Thresh and they are playing Gnar, if you have already earned your chest for Thresh then you won't receive one. You also have to have a chest available, you get one a week and they stack up to four, you can see how many you have available in you profile. You also have to own the champion you are playing or you will not receive any rewards for playing them.","replies":[{"poster":"Tempered in Salt","date":"2017-06-17T08:45:39.844+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Well the the thing is... I just got back from an extended break from league that lasted a few weeks and I'm pretty sure all requirements to get a chest were already reset. as i recall i didn't receive any chests in the few weeks both leading up to and after the extended break and yet is still says i have already acquires chests. Note: Chest acquired marks are only on the champions i own and only played recently so it has to be resent","replies":[{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2017-06-17T09:55:18.088+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You can only earn one chest per champion per *season*. So even if you took a bit of a break that requirement will not have reset, and won't until the end of the year.","replies":[{"poster":"Tempered in Salt","date":"2017-06-17T10:30:17.304+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Oh ok, thx i think i got this sorted now{{sticker:slayer-pantheon-thumbs}}","replies":[{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2017-06-17T13:31:35.603+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":":)","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]}
