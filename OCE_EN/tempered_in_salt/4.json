Sorry Riot if you see this but I&#039;m approaching year 11 / year 12 in high school and i just wanted to know that&#039;s the best way to stop / best way to send some one off? I might come back but it seems like I&#039;m gonna have to drop it... and also plz don&#039;t delete my account I might come back for it in uni.\r\n\r\nthx for any advice and good luck and have fun ( even though that isn&#039;t likely... this is league get real)\r\n\r\nPs: Gonna miss this game {{item:3151}}","replies":[{"poster":"Tele","date":"2016-08-23T08:28:32.998+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"As someone who had to cut back on League to pass Senior Calc I know exactly what you mean XD\n\nHere's my tips:\n\n\n\n1. **Go casual**\n I started playing ARAM and rotating mode **only** after school. Eventually I managed to cut that back to mainly just weekends, and now as my finals are coming up, I'll be phasing League out completely.\n\n The trick is to not do it all at once or you'll probably just log in again (unless you have great self-control).\n\n2. **Try to distance yourself League**\n Keep pro-play viewing at a minimum and cut back on streams. The last thing you want is to get hyped and log back in to League.\n\n3. **Don't kid yourself**\n If this isn't already familiar to you it will be soon:\n\n _\"I'm just logging in to chat with friends\"_\n*procrastinates studying by chatting with friends\n _\"Oh I got invited to a game, I guess I have to play now\"_\n\n You gotta learn to stop at the first step. Uninstall if you must, just make sure this doesn't happen. It's a vicious cycle.\n\n4. **Study away from your PC**\n This is more of a general study tip really, but stay away from your PC if possible. Having it close by is just a temptation to waste time. I like to spend time studying in the living room when no one's watching TV, but any quiet area works great.\n\n...And now I'll try to stop procrastinating on the boards and actually get some study done. \nGood luck!","replies":[{"poster":"Fitzky","date":"2016-08-23T08:39:50.361+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thank you for this, I'm going through a lot of hard times because of League right now and quitting League has become really hard for me, I'll be sure to try this!","replies":[{"poster":"veo","date":"2016-08-23T23:37:32.902+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Bump","replies":[]},{"poster":"Tele","date":"2016-08-23T08:47:57.455+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Glad I could help :D","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Tempered in Salt","date":"2016-08-23T09:25:25.778+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"my friends aren't helping though it's pretty much torture to listen to them talk about league","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Sloth Almighty","date":"2016-08-23T09:24:31.161+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"When I wanna quit a game, I find weaning myself off near impossible. Once I get hooked on a game, that's it there no weaning off. It's full on or not at all.\nSo I go cold turkey. I uninstall the game, remove all associated content (related apps, videos, screenshots) and that's it.\nBecause I'm so lazy and HATE with a passion installing and setting everything up again, it's too much effort so I stay away from it xD\n\nSo if you are like me, (true to my handle) a Sloth, then quitting is easy.","replies":[]}]}
