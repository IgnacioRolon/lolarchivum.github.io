I  mean like sure the games are toxic but I&#039;ve just been wondering round the OCE boards and it&#039;s a FRIGGIN CLEAN SLATE. I was asking my self the question WHAT IS THIS BLACK MAGIC?... maybe I haven&#039;t been on the right pages yet but the community does seem real nice. \r\n\r\nIf people are toxic though I think we should all try to work something out to purge the salt. Summoners code guys... it&#039;s there for a reason.{{sticker:slayer-pantheon-thumbs}} \r\n\r\n(btw this is my first time posting on the boards so plz don&#039;t flame too hard even though it would be quite ironic).","replies":[{"poster":"DannyMac","date":"2016-07-31T11:45:41.749+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"There is no such thing as toxicity.

As a Bronze 5 support main even if my adc is 0-12-1 with 4 farm at 20min I still keep calm and nice. I don't try to make big plays though and I roam a bit more to see what I can pick up, if they can manage under tower. Always try to work together and remember that no teammate is unworkable. If you can peel enough when trading or teamfighting, you'll get to see that beautiful damage lategame and sometimes people just get a bit tilted when they lose that first trade or first few cs. You just need to be considerate enough to help them get back into the pace of the game and they'll usually catchup and be extremely helpful in those last few teamfights.\n\nAnyone can become tilted if your pace is wrong, even your normal csing becomes really hard to manage. If a teammate is getting frustrated you just need to show them that you're there to help and that the team believes in them and they can win if they focus more and take a few deep breaths. Support isn't just making plays or warding. You also give the team emotional and morale support as well.","replies":[{"poster":"Nightjar","date":"2016-07-31T14:34:28.066+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You should always discourage abusive players though since they can upset the rest of the team and you should encourage them to take a more positive outlook. Sure the game isn't going well but we could still make a huge comeback and have alot of fun doing so. Don't afk, don't feed, we can do this. A comeback is always possible.\nThat said if you can't handle a really bad game, an honourable admission of defeat can often prevent people from tilting in their next game so if it really looks bleak it's ok to admit you lost.","replies":[{"poster":"bgentle2myashe","date":"2016-07-31T14:47:41.104+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"wow  i could use 4 of you in my games {{sticker:zombie-brand-mindblown}}","replies":[{"poster":"Nightjar","date":"2016-07-31T14:49:29.134+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"you really don't want me in your games.

League especially due to the singular focus on ranked compared and the tendency of our community to compare each other. It's something you can't help. Everyone is stressed, trying their best, avoiding multiple deaths. The stressful environment can cause alot of people to just lose their heads so it's good to always encourage the people you play with and be friendly and funny and just make sure everyone enjoys themselves. \nBeing Bronze 5 can be tough but in the end having fun is what's important. Summoners code is kinda corny though but just try to be nice with your teammates and even the enemy. Everyone is playing to have fun, there is no need to make people feel bad or get angry.\nThe boards nowadays don't seem as toxic because they are moderated and toxic comments are removed and normally the people who post aren't toxic and really just want to interact with other players in the community.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Project Xayah","date":"2016-07-31T11:14:48.967+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"> I've just been wondering round the OCE boards and it's a FRIGGIN CLEAN SLATE.\n\nYou must be looking at the wrong posts then. More than half the regulars are toxic to some extent (though, generally just sh!tposting and \"bait threads\").\n\nLoL is, no doubt, *one of* the most toxic online multiplayer communities, but I'm truly confident that quite a few other games *cough* DotA *cough* CoD *cough* ToS *cough* are worse (if not just as bad).","replies":[{"poster":"Tempered in Salt","date":"2016-07-31T11:27:54.515+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yep that seems about right XDD.

Sure, the game is set up to be designed for both casual and dedicated players but overall a 40 minute average length game which requires not just your own skill but that of your entire teams can create a stress environment and not quite everyone has the tenacity and persistence to remain calm all the time. Even in normals I at times feel very frustrated with my own team when a hard earned victory lied ahead but instead we wound up with a basic throw where we all conveniently got picked off one a time at the worst possible point in a game leaving the enemy to take baron and steam roll a single lane and push to the nexus. \n\nI have no doubt you would see something similar in other MOBA's like maybe DOTA but hear it mainly in League because it's a much more popular game overall. I hear that Heroes of the Storm has taken steps to lower the frustration and toxicity but alas this would not prevent someone from being what we would call toxic.","replies":[]},{"poster":"dslxk","date":"2016-07-31T17:16:09.173+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"what game are you playing?\n9/10 games i play there are toxic players.\ni just got a out of a game with typical chinese speaking premade that abused me even though the mid laner was dying every minute. in the end all of them just sat in base for the last 5 minutes abusing me saying i dont gank even though ive ganked every lane.\nits even funnier because i got the top laner first blood and he still gangs up on me with his broken english","replies":[]},{"poster":"Dota3iscoming","date":"2016-07-31T13:07:22.644+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"This is the boards, toxic plebs have no reason to be here lol, ofc it's gonna be clean. the boards are the 10% that are nice and non toxic people. the rest of the 90% don't care about the boards and just think it's useless lol","replies":[]}]}
