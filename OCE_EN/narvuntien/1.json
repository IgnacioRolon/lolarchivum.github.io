Otherwise a good way to stack up experience that works beautifully in low elo is that when your adc backs, try to hold the lane and deny the enemy cs and pick some juicy gold up for yourself. I've had bronze games where I have 3 times as much cs as the enemy adc just from pushing the wave consistently under tower and denying. \n\nAlso don't ward when the adc is about to clear a wave since you'll lose xp but if there are no low hp minions you won't lose xp although sometimes this is a good idea to help the adc catchup if they fell behind and you already have say lvl6 and they have lvl4. Also when you roam as support always try to force the enemy out and get some damage on the tower and unless you are speed gonzalas zilean or sona or have a global tp ult (is tahm kench still a viable support?) don't try to roam top. Just stick to mid and stealing the enemy blue buff if the enemy jungler is top or dead.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Devils Advocate","date":"2016-07-28T23:59:45.375+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Roaming to support others too much, always try to focus your support on the core of team fights / enemy trades, going back and forth between lanes when you don't even get an assist will slowly but surely kill your xp. \n\nAs mentioned, till you're bot is ready to roam also, its generally best to roam with your adc, if you have someone with speed or a great engage (As a Renekton supp, i tend to rush into mid to help gank often as im not a weak support champ, this allows JG to help more with top, clear the JG itself, and makes bot lane less predictable. \n\nAlso, smart warding of the blue/red can assist in easy ganks on JG which you also can get an easy tag to assist on, less inlane pressure etc.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Pikachoochoo","date":"2016-07-28T23:20:59.284+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You warded too much and lost xp from doing so?
