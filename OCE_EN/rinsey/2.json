I have recently been moving a lot as of late and haven&#039;t got adsl or any fancy internet, just simple ol phone 4g and I only get 4gb a month which is really sad! {{item:3070}} {{item:3070}} {{item:3070}} {{item:3070}} \r\nI understand this is a HUGE ask and that I am just one person, and it&#039;s probably the stupidest thing anyone has ever asked for but I can&#039;t only being able to play for 2 weeks and then have to wait another 2-3 to play again. I want to be able to keep practicing and getting to know my champs so when i do get more DATA I can dominate and maybe one day remove my account from bronze!{{item:3070}} {{item:3070}} \r\nBTW: Worlds Is Awesome and I will also be posting this on NA just to see if I can get others interested!\r\n{{champion:117}} {{champion:117}} {{champion:117}} {{champion:117}} {{champion:117}} {{champion:117}} {{champion:117}} {{champion:117}} {{champion:117}} {{champion:117}} {{champion:117}} {{champion:117}} {{champion:117}} {{champion:117}} {{champion:117}} {{champion:117}} {{champion:117}}","replies":[{"poster":"Tele","date":"2015-10-03T20:44:02.196+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"If this does happen, people will begin to mod League of Legends much more.

I mean it would take a while to make it so people can't mod and what not. Think about like this, if they were to bring it in, in order to play offline you would first need to login online, your account would then save to your files/client (like minecraft) and then after that you would be able to login offline and play bots! I don't mind if it doesn't happen and I understand the complexity of it all but again just a thought!","replies":[{"poster":"Tele","date":"2015-10-04T11:32:40.384+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You will never be able to stop people from not modding it. I can confirm that. I'm not sure if you're aware, but people are modding the game right now. Giving players the actual game just makes modding a lot easier. Not that mods are a bad thing necessarily, we would finally get that sandbox mode people want.\n\nRiot is terrible at disclosing information like this with fans, but I think there are 3 reasons why Offline Bots hasn't happened yet;\n\n1. League of Legends is coded like shit. They would rather no-one saw this, but it has long been speculated to be the truth.\n\n2. If mods got really popular, say to Minecraft levels of use, the LCS would become less and less relevant. Since really no one would be playing the official mode much anymore.\n\n3. Offline Bots would lead to sandbox mode. Riot actually talked about this surprisingly, and they said that they didn't want grinding for hours in a sandbox mode to become the norm for playing League.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Zorphiax","date":"2015-10-03T15:49:38.922+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Oh, your lucky none of the Summoners that say \"But then the hackers will be able to hack LoL better\" and other crap, have come on yet.\n\nBTW, I love the idea of offline mode.\n\nI also would like other modes like a campaign mode where you can do stories of each champion.(This probably won't happen and idc if it does or doesn't but I think it's a good idea)","replies":[{"poster":"Your Neighbour","date":"2015-10-04T04:15:08.594+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"But then the hackers will be able to hack LoL better","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"TheEventHorizon","date":"2015-10-03T12:56:21.538+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"bump","replies":[]},{"poster":"HJsFR33W1F1","date":"2015-10-03T12:51:11.498+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"bump","replies":[]},{"poster":"Currently Drunk","date":"2015-10-03T12:48:44.933+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey, I also like the idea of this.
