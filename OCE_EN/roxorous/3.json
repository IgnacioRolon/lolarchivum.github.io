Also FPS dropped heavily to 02 at the shop. Now I have a constant FPS 120 and above.\r\n\r\nWhat I did was\r\n1. Add 8G mem additional to what I already have which was 8G DDR3 1666 (note: Have chrome running with several active tabs going on, preloaded systray sfware going on and with LoL Operating, mem usage was around 75% on average)\r\n2. Install a liquid cooler on the CPU ( corsair H60 to be precise)\r\n\r\nThats all I did. And now the game runs marvelously. Hope this will enlighten some headaches out there.","replies":[{"poster":"TrashDonnut","date":"2015-01-03T11:59:05.283+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=roXorous,realm=OCE,application-id=Ntey9fRZ,discussion-id=jqJYu0EX,comment-id=,timestamp=2015-01-03T04:44:21.448+0000)\n>\n> Hi All\n> \n> I thought I share my experience in improving FPS.\n> \n> Before that, I have had drop of FPS whenever there is a Sona, Tresh **Stopped reading here**","replies":[]}]}
