But at the start of the game my LoL client and game is freezy and full of fps lagg. It only lasts the first couple of minutes, but on the rare occasion it also spikes halfway through a game (particularly when there&#039;s a big team fight ongoing). This never happened until the most recent in-game update and so I thought it may have downloaded incorrectly; So i even tried deleting all the game files off my computer and re-installing it completely, sadly the problem still persists. \r\nDoes anyone know of how to fix this problem? Or does anyone else incur the same problems. It puts me at a big disadvantage for the first few minutes of the game. \r\n\r\nMy computer has a 3GHz Processor with 4GB of RAM it runs a 64bit operating system (thats about as much as I know).\r\nThanks for reading my post :)","replies":[]}
