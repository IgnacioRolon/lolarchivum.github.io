This puts me, the player at fault for screwing my team over due to YOUR ridiculous servers. PLEASE FIX THEM. How hard is it to maintain a steady latency for your players who GENEROUSLY spend money on your game.

A lot of it is boring and not worth dealing with but just know that there's more to it than just \"Riot fix your servers\".\n\nHowever, Riot are actually working to make arrangements/agreements with various ISPs to try and correct the problems because honestly most of the time it's probably bottlenecks/faults/old-equipment in the physical network (ie your ISP or more likely Telstra) that's causing your problems.\n\nThink of it like this: It's actually relatively easy to build a giant Bunnings warehouse with a massive parking lot so that there's enough  room for every single customer. But if you have to drive down single lane dirt roads that have road works going on every other day you're still going to have difficulties getting there.  \n\n\nPS: Here's a red post about what they actually are doing for OCE: http://boards.oce.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/miscellaneous/iFdEkXnp-riot-oce-update-and-qa?comment=0000","replies":[]},{"poster":"Neba","date":"2015-08-13T23:50:56.997+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yea I don't have this issue mate.\n\nI use a wired connection as well.\n\nits crappy DSL as well I get a smooth 70ms and I live about as south as you can get internet.\n\nso to sum up its either \nyour network\nyour ISP\nyour computer\npeople sharing your network\n\nnot riots server","replies":[]},{"poster":"Talon12","date":"2015-08-13T10:28:41.435+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I learnt the only fix is wired connection where the server doesn't lose god damn 35% of packets transferring data to you","replies":[]}]}
