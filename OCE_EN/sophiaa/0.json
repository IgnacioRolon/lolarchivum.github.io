I believe the artist did end up being hired by Riot hence explains why the current splash's design is so similar to this fan art).\n* El Tigre Braum (credited and acknowledged to be a fan suggestion. I can't seem to verify it though, as the link to the source on the LoLwiki put me to a scam site for some reason, and googling doesn't do the job either).\n\nand maybe a couple more.","replies":[{"poster":"sophiaa","date":"2017-02-06T08:16:13.183+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thank you so much for the information :)","replies":[]}]}]}
