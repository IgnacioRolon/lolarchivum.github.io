So I thought why not just create one, so here it is, I call her Sicily the Child of Nature. There are definitely things that needs changing EG. less anime-like. But I think this character can fit in League of legends perfectly with just a few tweaks. She can be somehow related to LuLu I thought as they&#039;re both nature related :P so what are your thoughts? \r\n\r\nI&#039;m going to developing this character further in the hope that someone from Riot notices me :)","replies":[{"poster":"Thornax11","date":"2016-04-25T10:21:43.842+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Ok, just typing my thoughts here, so feel free to say that my ideas are horrible, but this is what I think of (kit wise) when I hear 'The child of nature'\n\n\nSicily: The Child Of Nature\n\nPassive: Beast Lover\n\nSicily takes %15 to %5 (scales with level) reduced damage from all minions including neutral, and enemy minions (even things like Yorick's summons).\n\nThis is because as she loves nature, so it should love her (specifically the animals), however as she becomes more powerful, she will need less help in the jungle; also I don't want a champion that can solo baron, elder dragon (soon) etc at their spawn time.\n\nAlternatively, I was thinking of a periodic heal on random allied stuff like how Illaoi Passive works (would be more support focussed).\n\n\nQ: Companion\n\nPassive: Sicily travels with her dog who attacks once every second basic attack, the dog scales with 0.2 of Sicily's A.D. \nThis dog is in tribute to devourer, which we will lose very soon. It would be un-targetable like an Azir soldier, would give vision, but would also reveal itself (if enemies saw it they would know that she was nearby.\n\nActive: Sicily's dog jumps to target location, if it: lands on an ally, it laps at their wounds, restoring 50%health lost within the last 5 seconds over the next 4 seconds; lands on an enemy, bites them, dealing 80/115/130/155/180 + 0.6 A.D. ~~and 0.3 A.P.~~ as Physical damage, Grievous Wounds are also applied for 4 seconds while the enemy bleeds, revealing them.\nWhen thinking about this, I thought about Nidalee jump, and an Azir Q, however I still wanted to incorporate the loving aspect, hence the heal.\n\n\nW: Petal Storm\n\n4/6/8/10 Mana\nToggle: Sicily emits petals from her in a spiral (kind of like in the picture) that reveal and slow enemies hit by %10/15/20/25/30 + 0.2 A.P., dealing 30/50/70/90 + 0.8 A.D. The slow does not stack, but is re-applied when being hit multiple times. \nThis was inspired by the picture, and I thought would be really helpful for a jungling situation. This is especially for low elo/new players that do not want to be camped in their jungle, especially with these new buff timers.\n\n\nE: Nature Lover\n\nPassive: Sicily gains 25 movement speed, %50 Health and Mana regen while in bushes (maybe have it scaling).\nShe is a nature child, so she should have buffs from nature.\n\nActive: Nearby bushes increase in size by %10/20/30/40/50, and become allied to which ever team Sicily is on (red or blue). Allies in the area gain the passive buff she does, while enemies recieve the opposite (%50 less health regen etc).\nThis could possibly be on just targeted brush, but it is mainly for jungle fights/skirmishes. especially in crowded bits, note that they would still obscure vision, so this could be used to help break line of sight in a defensive situation.\n\n\nR: Rise As One\n\nSicily joins forces with nature, binding herself with her dog, or any other minon within a certain area. She then becomes, and controls that  minion, gaining different base stats, and gains the abilities of that minion. While active Petal Storm is constantly toggled on. Also, if Sicily is killed in this mode, the killer gains the buff of the minion, and kills Sicily.\nSome examples of abilities could be:\nDragon: Shoots out 3 fireballs, like a Twisted Fate W but stops at first target.\nRed Buff: swipes target area, like Gnar ult, stunning enemies that hit a wall (but not as good obviously).\nBaron Nashor: The abilities that it has already (can be seen on wiki)\nBlue Buff: Creates slowing, damaging zone like a Lux and Morg W.\n\n\n\nPlay Style: Sicily would be a semi-squishy generally A.D. based jungler, with good burst and solid engage/disengage. I imagine her kind of like Evelynn, but more support oriented, still with the capability of carrying teams, especially with the ult.\n\nLore: I.D.K. Some lovely girl who wondered into the woods one day and dissapeared, really this could be worked into many if not any of the the places in Valoran. Personally I love the Idea of her being pre-rune war, and from Uristan before Zilean was born, that way his lore could also be futhrured. But I say this because this was someone elses idea from ages ago that I thought was awesome, and I love Zilean (I even did a possible re-work but no ne seems to care).\n\nPlease excuse any spelling/grammatacle mistakes, I haven't checked them. \nThanks, especially if you bothered reading that whole palava!","replies":[]},{"poster":"Devils Advocate","date":"2016-04-24T07:29:07.608+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Make another child champ...\n\n\nrelates it to a yordle...\n\n*facepalm*\n{{sticker:zombie-brand-facepalm}} \n\nback to the drawing board\n\n\nedit: I'm not trying to be discouraging... You just totally contradicted your own design within a paragraph. \nKeep thinking about it, come back with a new post regarding your idea.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Tele","date":"2016-04-24T08:25:52.103+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I see a bit of Haterade in the comments...\n\nhttp://img13.deviantart.net/69f7/i/2009/246/0/b/haterade_by_metalmaster2004.jpg\n\nI think your idea is pretty cool actually. The initial design is spot on, I can imagine myself playing it in-game just from the picture ;)\n\nOne thing though, make sure her lore isn't boring or anything. Give her something edgy or different. It would be lame if she was just a random pix, who becomes a champion because she's powerful. Even something simple like; Her cave was invaded by the Noxian army during the Ionian invasion... You might even want to tie up the Darkin or Bard into her lore.\n\nAnyways, great concept, I hope too see the rest on the boards soon!","replies":[{"poster":"NeoSimmer","date":"2016-04-24T09:06:35.418+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"im not hating  this champ takes a defining characteristic of another character which riot will not put into the game","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"NeoSimmer","date":"2016-04-24T07:06:32.447+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"mostlikely wont happen, the character isnt unique, see annie is unique as the only child in the league, every champion is unique in itself in this character i dont see anything unique","replies":[]}]}
