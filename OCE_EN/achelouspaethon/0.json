The lifesteal was pretty cool and made him suprisingly able to turn around fights, true but he wasn't very intuitive to play and the ghouls were so squishy and non-stackable that they felt more like buffs rather than an army. I mean might as well play warwick.\n\nI'm sorry you miss the old e but I really like the whole swarming army of the dead idea and with this new update he looks strong and actually playable outside of normals. I'm not saying old yorrick didn't have his moments but he wasn't all that strong, his ult was like a worse zilean ult and even when he was ahead he wasn't much of a threat and if he fell behind he was next to useless since he pretty much only had damage and no mobility in his kit.\n\nThis new direction also opens alot more complexity, utility and paths in his kit since his old version was extremely simple since his ghouls were more like buffs than separate assistants. Personally I think new yorrick will have some new interesting roles like full ad lifesteal jungler (I mean look at that damage in the champion preview when all his ghouls rushed at them, that's some strong ganking potential) and tank yorrick support since he now has some pretty good utility and probably good base damage and his ult will have good survivability standing next to the ad carry as a second ad carry to back him up making botlane a 3v2.","replies":[]}]}
