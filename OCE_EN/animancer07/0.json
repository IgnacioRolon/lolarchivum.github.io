When people want to try out new champions, they might go to blind pick to do so. So, you get many experienced players. But running with this logic, you should also get those experienced players in **your** teams.\n\n{{sticker:vlad-salute}}","replies":[{"poster":"Animancer07","date":"2018-07-25T12:02:28.112+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I see what you're saying, but when there are good players in your team and you do well, you don't necessarily have a decent play (i.e. good players get all the kills and you seem to be the only dead guy).
