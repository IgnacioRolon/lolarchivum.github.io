But the strange thing is that I started at checkpoint 2 out of 3 to level 3. Is it intended or a visual bug ?","replies":[{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2019-02-10T11:56:38.603+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Honour is meant to be a season long achievement so it's a long process. It takes the average player (or at least it did last season) 3-4 weeks per checkpoint, so it's not unusual to have not seen any progress yet.\n\nAs for starting at checkpoint 2, that's because you finished last season at Honour 4. H2 reset to H2, H3 to H2-1, and so on.","replies":[]}]}
