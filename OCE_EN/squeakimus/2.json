I've found the experience so far to be extremely offensive. My lack of response to team discussion has been interpreted as refusal to communicate on a number of occasions. I have no avenue to explain my actions, nor to try and help my teammates. I've actually found that the instances of people in game being abusive towards me has increased as a result of the chat ban.\r\n\r\nAll in all, this is a terrible attempt at player \"reform\" and realistically has no place in the league community.\r\n\r\nTL;DR: Chatbans make you powerless and increase abuse towards you.","replies":[{"poster":"Ing√©nue","date":"2015-02-01T13:44:51.029+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"If you got chat banned, chances are you got chat banned for a reason.\nCommunication doesn't have to be limited to typing in the chat, you can use pings. I mute everyone once I get in a game and just ping to communicate. It isn't hard.","replies":[]}]}
