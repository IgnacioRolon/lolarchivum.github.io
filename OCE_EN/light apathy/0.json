I have got 2 accounts banned in the last week because of me being toxic and for &quot;verbal abuse and harrasment&quot; yet in those 2 games i had to stand up for myself because my whole team was flaming me in the last game i played which was about 5 minutes ago and i had to defend myself because i tried to help the team and play nami support my jg mid and top were all feeding and none of them received any penalty that i know of but i swear or curse once and riot goes nope get perma banned. It is so fucking unfair on how this happens and that i swear once in game and riot has to instantly ban me but people feed and i try carry them and i pay the price because im toxic to the environment. Riot fix your shit and explain to me why this game is cancer","replies":[{"poster":"Essembie","date":"2017-12-27T02:27:56.446+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Petition for a mute all button.","replies":[]},{"poster":"meatjacker","date":"2017-12-26T03:49:33.604+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I think the automated banning system is pretty stupid.

A number of rioters who were popular on the boards have jumped ship and that is indicative of something bigger going on.","replies":[{"poster":"gangsha1ger","date":"2018-01-08T01:33:03.977+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yep, that makes sense.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Jakescape","date":"2017-12-25T18:25:33.453+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"The system is broken and heavily favors the trolls. You cannot say anything, even a small hint of negativity and this PC Riot will ban or restrict your account. The best thing to do is my honest opinion is to not say anything and mute everyone as soon as the game begins. It's literally the only way to prevent innocent people like us getting punished because we have a human reaction to a negative situation lol.\n\nI remember when there was a report option for 'failing to communicate' Like they forced you to talk to people even though they're toxic and if you mute them, that would be considered failing to communicate? So you have to sit there and look at them trying to persuade the enemy team to report you as well while you can't do anything and hope nothing happens to your account. I don't bother with ranked because of this reason. I've invested too much money into skins to be banned so I just play normals where reporting 'seems' like it's less effective.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Gol Acheron","date":"2017-12-24T18:42:09.424+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"I understand where you are coming from as I have been there with the bans and stuff, I was given a punishment for being \"toxic\" after 2 games with random 3 mans in my team harassing me and in the second game I actually defended myself I got a punishment but hey riot gave me a \"sorry you got harassed\" so it's a-ok. But you and I know we are both a \"little\" toxic. The best way to avoid the ban system is either to somewhat censor your swearing by using different words to substitute them or remove them completely. Another way to avoid being banned for expressing your discontentment with players is to just not type or you can do what I tend to do when I'm tilted off the earth, type your message in chat then hit ESC so you don't send the message but you still got to type it. Don't use racist, \"homophobic\" and etc kind of \"slang\" as even if used jokingly that one silent guy on the team or the enemy team if using all chat may report you. Also if you really feel the need to talk back to someone just be a smart-alike and be friendly with them lol (my personally favorite). {{sticker:galio-happy}}\nDisclaimer: I am not toxic anymore although I do use some of these techniques I do not flame be racist nor act homophobic I am simply stating these to help people out on their road to being reformed.","replies":[{"poster":"Gol Acheron","date":"2017-12-24T18:44:12.117+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"And I am also aware how aggravating it is to be carrying and have your team run around like headless chickens.
