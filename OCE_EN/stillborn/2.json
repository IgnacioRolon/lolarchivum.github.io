While people can sit there, egg you on to the point that you actually start tilting and cause you to lose your shit. Where&#039;s the justice in that? Where&#039;s the justice in the dude running down mid to the point where you tell him to &quot;fuck off&quot; and get banned just from them two words?\r\n\r\nRiot don&#039;t care. Because they know that said banned user, is going to make another account, spend more money and do the exact same thing.","replies":[{"poster":"Stillborn","date":"2018-06-04T08:17:51.551+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"bumping","replies":[]},{"poster":"Stillborn","date":"2018-06-03T12:22:45.743+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"If an actual Riot employee could comment on this and shed some light, that'd be very much appreciated.","replies":[]}]}
