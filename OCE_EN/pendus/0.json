You can check out everything we are doing to try combat negative behaviour here - http://boards.oce.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/announcements/L65wrRYe-player-behaviour-faq-updated-for-instant-feedback\n\nYour best bet is to report the player and leave a detailed description at the end of a game. Or in your case like Mutley and RogueStoney said send in a support ticket.
