I&#039;ve seen a couple threads about this before, and the response from a lot of riot employees is usually &quot;well actually, if you do the math you get more rp per aud than if we used exchange rates&quot;. This problem with this is that we have to pay more in total if we want to get a 1350rp or above skin. i dont want to pay extra  to get a 1350 rp skin and then have a useless amount left over. Please just change the bundles to be based on rp rather than a clean amount of $.","replies":[{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2018-07-08T10:10:29.726+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"I dunno about anyone else but I would rather spend a clean amount of money (easier to budget and manage) and get an awkward amount of RP (since the leftover doesn't go anywhere and you can use it later or on a key or something), than spend an awkward amount of money (more annoying to account for) and get a clean amount of RP.","replies":[]}]}
