So, because of internet troubles, i disconnected a couple games the other day and got 20 min leaver buster. I&#039;m not complaining about that, it&#039;s completely fair and justified, it was my fault for playing when i knew i had a poor internet connection. The problem i&#039;m having right now is that i&#039;m trying to queue up for some games to get rid of my leaver buster, but in about 2/3 queues, every time i get to about the 15-19 minute mark, i&#039;ll get a small (0.5 seconds, if that) lapse in my internet. This isn&#039;t usually a problem, as it doesn&#039;t usually do anything in game and if it does it just puts me on reconnect for about 2 seconds. However, this completely stops the queue. Now, i understand that obviously, if someone disconnects, their queue should stop so that they don&#039;t get a leaverbuster for not accepting games, but i seriously don&#039;t think that the queue should stop no matter what, even if i just have a slight lapse in connection. It is making my 20 min leaver buster queues (which are bad enough already) almost impossible to do since it just resets every 15 mins. Anyone else have any similar issues?","replies":[]}
