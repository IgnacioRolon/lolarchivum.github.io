This basically means that it will take your MMR and lower it bit so when you do your placements, you end up slightly lower than where you ended (usually). \n\nFrom what I gathered on the boards at the beginning of season, if you won 7-8 games, you would get placed where you left off. Out of everyone I know, only one person ended up higher, and that is because he went from bronze to diamond during preseason. (This part is purely speculative, as Seph said, nothing official is released on how MMR works).\n\nLast season you ended in bronze 4, so the pattern seems to fit.","replies":[]},{"poster":"SephirothSG","date":"2016-05-04T23:08:57.000+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey there,\n\nUnfortunately there isn't much public information on the MMR system and most things you'll find are speculative.\n\nFrom what I can gather looking up some info on your account (op.gg, etc) you did do really well in your ranked games, were most of them duo games? This can negatively affect your MMR (speculative) and place you in a lower tier (Or the complete opposite, depending on who you queue with).\n\nop.gg estimates your MMR to be higher than the average for your division, this _should_ mean that you'll climb very easily, however MMR is all speculative.","replies":[]}]}
