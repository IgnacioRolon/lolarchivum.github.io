Basically the server doesn't get the message that the game is over, even though it is. Typically it works itself out within an hour or two, though they can (very rarely) take as long as 5~. It's not something that can really be fixed manually, you just kinda have to wait for the server to catch up.\n\nSeems like there was probably some minor server issues that resulted in an uptick in ghost games so hopefully you won't see one again anytime soon :)","replies":[]},{"poster":"smelke","date":"2018-03-07T02:12:13.815+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"It's happening to me as well, When i log in it tries to connect to the old game, i click cancel and it gets me out but then i can't start a new match.
