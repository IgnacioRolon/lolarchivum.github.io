Randomly, when I load into the new draft system, it turns black. It always works the day before with no difficulties and EVERY time I have to reinstall or repair my league client which can take anywhere from 30 minutes to a few hours. I don&#039;t have any third party programs installed or anything; it&#039;s a completely vanilla League client. I don&#039;t know if there&#039;s anyone else having these problems and if so, are there any known fixes other than repairing/reinstalling League?\r\nThanks","replies":[{"poster":"SephirothSG","date":"2016-03-12T03:46:28.708+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"That sounds odd, if you have to perform a repair to resolve the issue it sounds to me like something is causing file corruption.\n\n*  What antivirus are you running?\n*  Have you added the LoL directory to your antivirus' exceptions?

It's possible your drive could be experiencing issues, have you had any similar problems in any other games/applications installed onto the same partition?","replies":[]}]}
