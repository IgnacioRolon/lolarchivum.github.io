It's to prevent people waiting around for the remake, only to have the afk/dc rejoin and then have the whole team behind. That said I'm uncertain how this works when the afk is on the enemy team, but given everyone else has CS and you don't it makes me think that was what happened.\n\nOtherwise [submit a ticket to player support](http://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/requests/new) with the screenshot and ask them why, they should be able to tell you.\n\nThe Vel has \"Leave\" in his op.gg match history, so clearly the API knows whats up. More than likely he did lose LP for it and it's just a visual bug in the official match history (I'm not sure the official match history has a precedent for remakes, like it does for Loss Forgiven which is Yellow).","replies":[{"poster":"BTSU","date":"2016-07-21T06:11:11.947+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Fair call, except I did buy some items and made my way to jungle. \n\nThanks though","replies":[{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2016-07-21T10:48:36.377+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It's not a big deal, you know now.
