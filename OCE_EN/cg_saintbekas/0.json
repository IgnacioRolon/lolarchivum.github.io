The alpha client is a little slow atm, in part due to the need to interface with the old client, but more often that will affect things like lobbies and chat loading times more than simply pressing play.\n\nIf turning off animations doesn't work I'd probably recommend running a client repair which can be done in settings under the \"GENERAL\" tab.\n\nI'm afraid I don't know what the min requirements are, but the new client is optimised better than the old one, so if you could run the old client with no problems you shouldn't be having this much trouble with the alpha client.","replies":[]}]}
