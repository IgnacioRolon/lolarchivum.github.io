counters the meta...since the meta is shifting again towards double ranged ADC. either with a top or mid ADC. teemo can go in both those lanes and deny them their faster power spikes compared to bot lane, or atleast slow them down a bit.\n\nthe only thing wrong with teemo is he lacks a true identity. he cant split push as well as others but he has a self safety net while split pushing. he cant team fight well with short range and a single target blind. and half of his kit isnt designed for teamfighting. furthermore his item build paths arent exactly intuitive of his design. killer assassin rat thing, on hit damage over time or exploding damage over time abilities/focal points of build paths.\nbuilding as an on hit gives no assassination power, so seemingly against his design ideal. building for massive nuke ults...luck based if anyone even goes over them, not exactly assassinations when you have no factor in the hit apart from placement. surprise invis assassinations based on people walking TO your point of hiding, 0 get in and get out potential, no escape like all other assassins.","replies":[{"poster":"Justify","date":"2014-12-16T03:17:29.134+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Thanks for your analysis, but I don't see how he counters the meta.\n\nLiterally anyone can start mr quints + flask then begin to outscale teemo\n\nLike Maokai vs Teemo for an example\nMaokai farms from range with q and e, teemo uses blind to poke maokai, maokai waits for 2-3 seconds and starts last hitting again...\nEven if teemo times his q right it doesn't change the fact that he gets outscaled really hard. \n\nTeemo vs any ap mid = teemo's q damage is negligible, e relies on you dealing sustained damage, most ap mids will just chunk teemos face when he goes in on them...\n\nTeemo vs Nasus = Teemo is annoying for a bit but he is so squishy, Nasus w slow will most likely lead to teemos demise from a jg gank,  a good Nasus can easily win this matchup  through severe out-scaling it feels.  \n\nDealing with Teemo is like dealing with a weaker version of lane pantheon. \nExcept lane pantheon can setup awesome skirmishes with R, and capitalize on enemies going deep.","replies":[{"poster":"KingDinger","date":"2014-12-17T04:09:33.874+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"im afraid you didnt even read my comment...\n\n\"since the meta is shifting again

Teemo the ranged apc top lane is as useful as Jayce? You have got to be kidding, Jayce has such a versatile kit. \nJayce can give his entire team a talisman of ascension, he gets ms after changing stances, combined with all this ms a q to gap close, endless poke, decent 1v1 potential once he gets his 4th-5th item + isn't nearly as vulnerable as teemo, all Teemo provides is a q aa blind mechanic which requires him to get in dangerously close, some nice shrooms to catch off enemies, then sustained dps/chase potential with e and w. \n\nEarly game: his weakest point but actually isn't that weak if you know how to play it\nmid game: decent poke, seems to win a lot of exchanges with (ranged) q > e > r > q > e \nlate game: murmana/arpen/crit = blows up squishies + pretty decent siege + deletes towers like Nasus","replies":[{"poster":"KingDinger","date":"2014-12-18T21:31:38.466+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"so....teemo is bad because 1 over powered over loaded champ is stronger?\nyou really have no idea why you are complaining about teemo anymore do you?\n\nteemo is in a good spot and doesnt need changes, simple as that. any buffs would be short sighted and completely stupid. \nre-balancing his kit would be 1 option, but as i said before, he has 2 distinct identities that both fall a little short of other champs. and focusing on one would remove the other, which would hinder 50% of teemo players, as not everyone plays teemo 1 way or the 1 way rito would choose to focus on.\n\ntl:dr of this whole thread; there is nothing wrong with teemo except his identity. overall one of the most balanced champs in the game.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Tele","date":"2014-12-15T19:36:24.682+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Buff Teemo?
