So, if you had 100% mana regen, you would just multiply your base mana regen by 2. But if you had 200%, and then you added 100%, you would times it by 3, not 4, because it's your base mana regen times 300%. This is how I'm getting confused.","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Justify","date":"2014-12-22T06:31:43.337+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"that makes it easier thx","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Klavinmour","date":"2014-12-22T04:58:35.948+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Twice the mana regen of 100%.
