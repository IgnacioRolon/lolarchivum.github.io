Riven manaless/energless.\r\n2. Riven deals burst damage, Darius sustained damage.\r\n3. Riven has an easier job at blowing up squishies due to e, q and flash.\r\n4. Riven deals greater aoe.\r\n\r\nDarius however acts as a better frontline tank and can threaten opponents with his E.\r\n(Darius needs to build correctly ofc, must darius go Hydra,Triforce,BT, lw.","replies":[{"poster":"Slim Chaedi","date":"2015-01-14T06:53:20.090+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Darius makes Tryndamere cry in death.","replies":[{"poster":"Justify","date":"2015-01-14T07:55:03.433+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"if Darius doesn't get a 15+ cs lead Tryndamere will slowly out scale and out duel Darius.","replies":[{"poster":"Slim Chaedi","date":"2015-01-15T04:34:44.962+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Justify,realm=OCE,application-id=FjGAIbRv,discussion-id=yYuQG73Z,comment-id=00010000,timestamp=2015-01-14T07:55:03.433+0000)\n>\n> if Darius doesn't get a 15+ cs lead Tryndamere will slowly out scale and out duel Darius.\n\nA Darius can make Tryndamere cry with his passive though, is what I am trying to say.
