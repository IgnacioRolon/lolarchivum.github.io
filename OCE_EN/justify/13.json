Sure there is the competitive side, but regardless that I am bronze or if I was Gold I'd treat it as the same; A game.  I just find ranked more challenging. I usually just tab to the internet, watch a video and then when my turn to pick comes the game will interrupt whatever I am doing and I choose what I want out of What is left. Sometimes I get top, others jungle or support.  Then I go into the game and play my best and try to carry.  If someone is acting like this is LCS then I just mute them. I play this game with the singular goal of reaching Silver 5.  After I reach that I'll probably be content to play normal or Bots.  Going higher just doesn't interest me. I'm at Bronze 1 at the moment.","replies":[]},{"poster":"HORSE OF FORCE","date":"2015-01-07T08:18:06.221+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Well, ranked is a competitive, higher-stakes version of normals with more done to balance out the teams. By nature it will be more stressful than a normal game.\n\nIf you *really* want to play ranked with less stress though, then here's what I suggest. Stop playing carry roles, like adc or mid. In those roles you have to pay a lot more of attention than any other role, especially the adc, where your team has to adequately protect you in team fights and play their game to compensate for you (which unfortunately doesn't happen often).\n\nI suggest you go and play as a tanky top laner. They say that top lane is an island, and it's true if you're a tank. You can just stay in lane all day, soaking up farm, not really pushing for the tower, for quite a while. You won't be needed to take dragon, you won't be roaming, a bit less stressful than the other roles.\n\nBest of luck.","replies":[{"poster":"Justify","date":"2015-01-07T10:36:00.563+0000","up_votes":0,"down_votes":0,"body":"Lol I have tried playing tank top lane, I stay ahead on cs but 90% of the time mid/bot can't hold it out, I have 0 wins 7 losses with Maokai top lane... if I ever go top lane it is with Renekton/Jayce/Hecarim, because these champions can actually snowball a lane, but each one does different things. \n\nRenekton = snowbally split pushing tank\nHec = roamer/split pusher/team fighter\nJayce = sieger","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Project Xayah","date":"2015-01-06T08:08:11.272+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> How to have fun with ranked\n\nPlay normals.
