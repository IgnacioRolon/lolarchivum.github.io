After this it all comes down to pushing a lead and playing sensibly, in high diamond this can be possible, though in some cases high diamond players might die unnecessarily, but it is far more of a common occurrence in lower elos.\r\n\r\nThe point I am trying to make is, every elo looks grim, but it is all down to what you can make of every situation and how quickly you adapt to your environment, always remember in lower elos there will be a stupid thing a player will do and it is all up to you to capitalize on that, if you make a lot of errors you need to pray to God that you aren't punished, and to be honest, in silver or bronze people will not get punished as much as they should. Think about it, in a silver 3 game there is a plat+ jungler, in this game the plat jungler will be more active in punishing stupid plays, they will continue to do so until the enemies nexus is destroyed or are very fed. \r\n\r\nNearly every situation is different, so you need to learn how to play that situation right, and make the most out of it. (sometimes there isn't anything you can do)\r\n\r\nTL;DR Elo hell isn't real","replies":[{"poster":"Your Neighbour","date":"2014-12-12T23:23:21.391+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Dear diary","replies":[]},{"poster":"XURiN","date":"2014-12-12T23:09:12.356+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Wise words. As for the tldr; I do agree that elo hell doesn't exist, but it completely depends on the time frame on what elo hell is classified as If you're stuck in that elo for a month+ then yes elo hell would not count as an excuse. However, if you a player is struggling in a division for a couple of days, then an excuse such as this might be made (if LP gains are low or you are just having a streak of really terrible players) Although I would not exactly use the phrase 'elo hell' to describe this, but I do think players can be stuck in a division for a few days or weeks and still have the right skill level to progress higher. Any more time than that however, and the notion seems less believable.","replies":[]}]}
