I like him more than Jayce because of his all in potential too (jayce is about whittling them down and using tonnes of mana)\r\n\r\nJ4 seems like a pretty solid pick for snowballing the f*ck out of the top lane and scales well into the mid/late game, he is great if you can actually burst people down or they don't dash through your ult. \r\n\r\nRiven - Been considering maining her for awhile now, she has 4 gap closers is manaless, has pretty decent all in potential mid game and good bursts of damage in the early game. I am just worried of champions like Rammus, even if I get ahead  by a lot they are a real nuisance. \r\n\r\nSwain - he is a really good lane bully and can sustain with double dorans + roa, his kill potential with flash > e > q > w >  r ignite is awesome, his only downside is long range champions and inability to roam because of bad clear. (consider maxing his aoe w if you snowball)","replies":[{"poster":"Wiggy","date":"2014-12-12T15:49:05.168+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"learn 2-3 champions for every role, once learnt, focus on mastering, forget the rest\n\ni top yorick teemo and malphite, between those 3 i can take on any top laner, and if one of them is picked one of the others counters\n\ni mid veigar katarina and mordekaiser, again you see a pretty decent variety\n\njunge - yi/xin/warwick/rammus/eve/udyr\n\nsupp - raka/sona/morg/voli/blitz/leo/malphite etc etc\n\nadc - mf/ashe/cait/vayne\n\njust set yourself up with a decent pool for each lane, even if you pick in to counters, honstly ive picked right in to a top counter because i didnt want to trial a new champ in ranked and done just fine.\n\nlong story short, the only thing limiting you climbing, is you.","replies":[{"poster":"TrashDonnut","date":"2014-12-12T21:30:54.537+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Never have i seen a Yorick.\n\nAnd i've been playing for a year.\n\nUnderrated...","replies":[{"poster":"Wiggy","date":"2014-12-13T12:34:58.150+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"he's severely under-rated, he is a massive lany bully to almost everybody other than jayce and morde, and the only champ ive seen straight duel him and win is volibear b/c he just confuses the ghouls and wrecks yorick after that lol","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"TrashDonnut","date":"2014-12-12T21:32:26.276+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Jayce is pretty dependant on mana.\n\nThat's why the 1000mana in {{item:3042}} is very very helpful.","replies":[]}]}
