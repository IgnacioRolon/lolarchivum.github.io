I am just curious as to how guys like piglet and gosu come out with the insane W/L and what separates them from your typical silver/gold ADC.","replies":[{"poster":"Alamo","date":"2015-06-18T00:08:43.962+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> \"Guys\" don't exist.\n\nUwotm9","replies":[]},{"poster":"SEKAI","date":"2014-12-02T12:46:45.058+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"1.
