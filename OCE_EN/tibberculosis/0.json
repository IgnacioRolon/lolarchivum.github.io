Queues for Ranked is taking exceptionally long.\r\n\r\nIf I was to choose mid/top, it would take me roughly 12 minutes to find ONE accept/decline match. What&#039;s going on? Are players quitting or? \r\n\r\nI can understand when they went to play the rotating gamemode, the weekend would literally have no players. \r\n\r\nThen there are the non-English speaking players... Most games I get players that use boxes to type, I understand it&#039;s a different language and I don&#039;t have the software on my PC to read it, I can&#039;t find ways to communicate with my team most games and that just ruins it for me. It feels like I&#039;m playing Single player. \r\n\r\nAnyone know what&#039;s going on or what I could do?
