The warrior held his shield high, resisting the cold air firmly and steadily. A few moments had passed, he suddenly halts, dropped his spear and closes his eyes, feeling the breeze of cold wind and its bearing with his right hand.\r\nThe lone warrior takes a deep breath and smiles, he immediately kneels and held his shield decisively with his motion in success to block a barrage of arrows. He swiftly grabbed and tossed his spear and caught it upright with his right hand and span into motion of a javelin throw as he exhaled with ferocity.  The spear tore through the icy mist in front of him until it struck a significant blow into one of the assailants.\r\nWith the wind and mist in brief moment dispersing from his impeccable and powerful throw, it gave him the locations of all the attackers. Before he pressed onward he counted and yelled &ldquo;One!&rdquo; The warrior slithered his way from the direction of the arrows constantly barraging him. His movement were agile and precise, he took every opportune moment to block the incoming arrows in flawless predicament whilst still being able to see their exact positions.\r\n\r\n&ldquo;Fire at Will!&rdquo; One of the attackers commanded in sudden panic, the warrior stopped and then proceeded to advance but this time faster in pace. He tilted as he ran while grabbing a handful of snow and dirt, curdling it with his right hand. He threw it to the closest assailant and lunged at him in full force with his shield knocking him back. He quickly peered to his left and held his shield up, blocking two arrows. He took no hesitation and directly hitting the neck of the attacker who was knocked down with the edge of his shield. &ldquo;Two!&rdquo; the warrior continuous to count, he inhaled deeply once again as he blocks the next flurry of arrows, he saw the closest aggressor dropping his bow and unsheathed a broadsword.\r\nThe warrior took a glance on a nearby body ahead, behind the wielded swordsman and smiled. The warrior took hold of his shield by the edge and hurled it to a bowman and instantly leaned down as he continued advancing forward to grab a handful of snow and dirt whilst evading an arrow. He shot the man with a sword by the head and the warrior took hold of him and threw him down the edge of the mountain as he exhaled &ldquo;Three!&rdquo; He yelled in a war cry tone. \r\n\r\nBefore he could continue with a step forward, a sudden flash immersed from the sky, a sun-ray struck the remaining attackers, disintegrating them into ashes. The warrior quickly knelt to the ground and covered his entire body from the smouldering light with his shield. As he recovered to his feet, he heard a swirling sound, the warrior&rsquo;s eyes widened and shifted away to evade his very own spear been thrown at him.\r\nHe takes a second to look at the spear behind him and slowly turned his gaze upon this new found foe. \r\n\r\nThe atmosphere densifies with radiant light and the howling wind were all but non-existent. &ldquo;Four, five, six, seven, eight?&rdquo; The mysterious figure calls out in mockery, &ldquo;Oh Atreus, how long has it been since I&rsquo;ve challenged you?&rdquo; the warrior slowly turns his back from the figure and made his way to his spear, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m no longer the man you have faced, I, am more, I am Pantheon.&rdquo; The mysterious figure drew her Zenith Blade from her Shield of Daybreak and clapped it together. &ldquo;I felt a presence of another celestial Aspect in this part of Mount Targon, so I suppose that&rsquo;s you.&rdquo; \r\nPantheon reaches his spear and grips it and took a very deep breath. &ldquo;If you stand triumphant, know a greater challenge lies before you afterwards.&rdquo; Pantheon acclaims as he slowly took a readying stance, his legs wide apart, his muscles tensing and his entire body surrounded by surging aura. Leona swiftly charged at Pantheon and gripped on her shield tightly which started emitting sunlight that surrounded her as a barrier. Pantheon exhales and leapt through the air and into sky instantly. Leona held her shield high in attempt to break Pantheon&rsquo;s grand skyfall, Pantheon landed on top of her shield but she blocked it unscathed. Leona&rsquo;s barrier erupted and pushed Pantheon back.\r\nPantheon rapidly threw a spear shot at Leona and immediately ran towards her. \r\n\r\nLeona struck her blade in the snow and caught the spear with her right hand. She made a quick smirk and tossed the spear to the edge of the Cliffside. Pantheon instantly halted with his gaze fixated on his spear falling. &ldquo;Such a cowardly act!&rdquo; he shouted. Leona smiled while taking her sword and continued rushing forward.\r\nPantheon slowly advances and again took handful of snow on his hand. He started to pelt Leona with several snowballs till she closed in on him. Her Zenith Blade had lit in burning incense and she reached for Pantheon&rsquo;s position while he himself dashed toward Leona in effort to block her with his shield. Before the two collided, beams of silver fire shot between them causing both warriors to standstill. Leona braced herself with a shield stance &ldquo;Oh, no&hellip;&rdquo; she exclaims, Pantheon was confused but he retained a strong stance.  \r\n\r\nA mysterious man leaped from the edge of the slopes with a mace hanging by his belt, surrounded by a distinctive gem shield and holding Pantheon&rsquo;s spear on his right hand.\r\n&ldquo;Is this man one of yours?&rdquo; Leona asks as she activates her Daybreak shield. Pantheon shook his head &ldquo;You! Warrior! Give me my spear, I have a duel needed to be won!&rdquo; Pantheon exclaims as he reaches his right hand with a friendly intention. &ldquo;I am no mere warrior! I am imbued with celestial powers with protecting Runeterra!&rdquo; the man answers. &ldquo;I am Taric! Now help me defeat my pursuer!&rdquo; \r\nThe man passes the spear to Pantheon, all the while another figure emerges from the edge of the slopes. Three beams of silver fire arched from the unknown figure and made impact upon Leona, Pantheon and the man whose name is Taric with all three successfully blocking them with their shields. &ldquo;I sense these two&rsquo;s ethereal presence.&rdquo; Leona spoke cautiously. &ldquo;And I have another familiar traction with this one.&rdquo; Leona continues as she regards the unknown woman who has her eyes gazed upon Taric. &ldquo;Take arms you fool, or you shall be slaughtered by Moonsilver.&rdquo; The woman says in ferocity.\r\n\r\n&ldquo;Diana the heretic! I&rsquo;ve longed for this moment, prepare for you&rsquo;re final judgement!&rdquo; Leona screamed fiercely completely devoid of Pantheon and Taric&rsquo;s presence. &ldquo;We still have a duel to settle here Solari!&rdquo; Pantheon shouted. Diana unheeded Leona&rsquo;s words and started walking toward Taric with intent to kill. &ldquo;Wait in line, this heathen needs to pay for attempting to kill me with a spear!&rdquo; Dianna said with glimmering eyes and blazing silver fire starts to appear around her.\r\n&ldquo;Tis not I who threw that spear nor I that claims to own it!&rdquo; Taric replied as he grabs his mace from his belt with caution. Diana glimpsed at the spear Pantheon was holding. &ldquo;So it was you perpetrator!&rdquo; Diana yelled and changed her direction of advancement toward Pantheon. &ldquo;The only true perpetrator here is you Diana, you are the blasphemous traitor here!&rdquo; Leona used her Zenith blade once again and this time aimed at Diana. In a sudden, Taric held his mace and caused a starlight beam to knock Leona in concussion. &ldquo;Stop this insolence! We&rsquo;re all imbued with celestial Aspects, our duty lies with Runeterra itself!&rdquo; Taric acclaims fondly as he uses starlight magic and touched Leona with it, regaining her consciousness.\r\n\r\n&ldquo;This murderer laid rampant, she shall pay for her crimes!&rdquo; Leona insisted. Unexpectedly, Pantheon charged in on three of them and swiftly sought to strike their hearts with his spear in continuous motion. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re wrong warrior Taric, this is a battle, a battle with no armies involved but champions with might and power!&rdquo; Pantheon shouted as he dashed on Taric. Taric was knocked down from the front of Pantheon&rsquo;s shield. Diana ran to Taric&rsquo;s aid while Leona quickly raised her sword and a flare of sunbeam struck Pantheon aside.\r\nDiana took Taric&rsquo;s arm and assisted him on his feet. Leona took Taric&rsquo;s mace and placed it on Taric&rsquo;s hand. &ldquo;Verdict will come for her at a later time, but for now-&ldquo;. Leona was cut off from the sudden darkening of the skies. The clouds dispersed and stars glimmered while Pantheon started to laugh. &ldquo;Is this you Diana?&rdquo; Leona asked, &ldquo;N-no, it isn&rsquo;t.&rdquo; Diana answered. The three huddled in defensive while above them a gigantic celestial-being appeared with great cosmic power  speaking in echoing words &ldquo;Targon, I have returned for Redemption and Impartiality.&rdquo;","replies":[{"poster":"Cornelia Senpai","date":"2016-06-30T13:19:15.397+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"My idealistic Approach to Runeterra: Celestial Aspects of Mt Targon;-\n\nFor me, I see these four as the founders of Celestial Aspects and for me that means they're the best of the best, on top of their perfect personalities reinforcing their characteristics they merge themselves into greater lengths in terms of power (to me that's like saying they're the Trinity of DC). Can their feudal past be forgotten?\n\nMy Intuition with the story:\nI wanted the story to revolve around the certain perspective of how battle plays out in words and how each characters subjectively segregate themselves within Runeterra itself. I wanted to give the first few paragraphs to state how that felt and how crucial it is to time words just as how in reality choreography time itself in fluidity.\n\nThe Sub-plot:\nI wanted to introduce Pantheon to be known as \"the warrior\" so that people that aren't familiarized with him would deem him befitting a heroic character. But for people who do know him as the person who holds a shield and a spear, with his characteristics, I want them to feel the sense of grounded atmosphere and how realistically Pantheon's gameplay would play out in real-life Runeterra from his Spear throwing and shield bashing to his agile mobility. Not much action is given for Taric and Diana but through the build up of Pantheon, I wanted to give the readers a sense of continuity and have them on a \"cliffhanger\" for their imagination to create the rest. I added the ideologies of all four characters so their individuality may also be recognized for the reader to visualize their future battles and confrontations with each other. With four different conflicts and another arising in the very last sentence, the story should be able to hold a sense of \"wanting more\".","replies":[]}]}
