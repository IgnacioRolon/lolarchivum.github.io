I spent approximately an hour looking through the support thread for Login Issues and i couldnt figure out what had done it. The only thing i could think of is that I have Windows Vista, and as such i am using Internet Explorer 9. \r\n\r\nNow the support thread says i have to use the latest updated version of IE : \"League of Legends requires Internet Explorer to be fully up to date.\"\r\nMy question is, does that mean I can never play League of Legends on my computer? Windows Vista cannot download/install the latest version of IE (Internet Explorer 11), so does that mean that I, and all other Vista users (admittedly, that basically no-one at this point) can never play the game?\r\n\r\nYours truly, RectalRocket (I know, its quite the name!

I thought we were on 11.\n\nAnd it sucks that the official Microsoft site won't let you download the latest Internet Explorer (even though it works fine).\n\nBut anyway, League was originally programmed to run on Internet Explorer 6, and I doubt that Riot have changed the coding too much concerning how the League client logs you in. You should be able to use Internet Explorer 9.\n\nBe sure to troubleshoot through [this page](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues) first, as it could just be a connection issue, not your Internet Explorer being outdated. And if that still somehow doesn't work, reset all your settings on Internet Explorer and then set it's security level to low.\n\nBest of luck.","replies":[]}]}
