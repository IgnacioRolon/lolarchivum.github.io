If the plan is &quot;ignore this until people stop whinging&quot; be honest, say somewhere that your patching system doesn&#039;t save what it&#039;s downloaded so people don&#039;t make the same mistake i do.","replies":[{"poster":"Kao Atlantis","date":"2016-01-04T19:36:15.208+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hello Fazedbyzero,\n\nI see that you have looked around the board a bunch to see if you can find a way to solve your problem. I am not sure which posts you looked at, but I would recommend seeing if you haven't tried something listed on the [official article provided by Riot's support about Patching Issues](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/202969434-Patching-Issues).\n\nThis board is actually intended for community members helping each other out, not for Riot to help with problems. If you would like Riot staff to directly address the problem you are having, I would recommend submitting a support ticket directly to them. You can do [that at this link](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/requests/new).\n\nI hope that your problem is resolved promptly.","replies":[{"poster":"Fazedbyzero","date":"2016-01-05T02:03:32.138+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"No worries, thank you","replies":[]}]}]}
