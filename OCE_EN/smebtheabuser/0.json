This guy called \"Smeb\" Spent the hole game abusing the team and saying s$#t. Ik this is league and this sort of thing happens a lot but this guy took it to far. He told one of the enemy team-mates that his mother had died and he went on rambling and afk all game. I feel there is no justice done for this sort of behavior. If you come across this player i recommend muting him as soon as the game starts.","replies":[{"poster":"Krownus","date":"2015-01-27T02:21:04.737+0000","up_votes":7,"down_votes":2,"body":"Honestly, I think this guys behaviour is over the top. To say that a loved one is or should be dead... I am just speechless.  The sad truth of Riots community is this is not a rare occurrence.  To make matters worse, there is not an overwhelming amount that riot  are doing/ are able to do. I know, being a very frequent player of LoL that, I too have had a bad game. Still, this does not deter me from remaining active in  the game as it did this \"Smeb\" person.  Riot needs to atleast try to do more about the immense population of toxic players. Honestly, I don't want to play if I am guaranteed to have something in my game that will ruin the joy of LoL and my day.","replies":[{"poster":"CLG looper","date":"2015-01-27T11:24:55.002+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Well said good sir\n{{summoner:13}}","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Urgot Bot","date":"2015-01-27T06:06:44.276+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"But your name is Smeb o.O","replies":[{"poster":"Smebtheabuser","date":"2015-01-27T06:44:51.631+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"This is a lvl 1 new account i made so i could post this thread.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Charrd","date":"2015-01-27T04:08:26.435+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"People who rage in gold + don't deserve their rank,","replies":[]},{"poster":"CLG looper","date":"2015-01-27T11:23:26.174+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"OMG, please ban him.
