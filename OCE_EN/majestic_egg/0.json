Every time I get in a game someone does some normal BM by just popping a &quot;?&quot; or &quot;Ez&quot; which is fine, but when I kill them I usually do it back but most of the time they will respond with some pretty hating stuff like, &quot;Lol stfu you&#039;re FLIPPING bad at the game lol you just want an excuse to not go to school because you&#039;reifikaf0awfoaw0fpikaw-0pfik.&quot; Although Riot will not ban this sort of behavior as it does not contain some hatespeech or vulgarity because idk. I&#039;m not sure if I can report someone for partial harassment through a ticket without it being discarded, if I can, then I&#039;ll be doing that.","replies":[{"poster":"slxw","date":"2018-12-26T10:53:51.102+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"LOL is a hard game, and it takes a long time just to learn it, let alone be good.\nNow 2 years of playing and of new understanding on game culture, I think people a little soft.\nYou should know that after time and time again the game and most people are pretty cool.\nGL noob.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Ingénue","date":"2018-12-26T03:47:13.128+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"First of all, Riot does punish that kind of behavior as it counts as a form of \"persistent negativity\". It does take a while longer to detect since you get a few free passes for being a bit of a bad mouth since everyone has a bad game here and there and that is understood. Its also harder to pick up on since it can be said many different ways, but if a player is consistently BMing and creating a negative environment for their team, it will eventually result in a punishment. \n\nBest thing you can do in this situation is to mute the enemy team and their emotes, and don't taunt them the the \"?\". Be the bigger player. \n\nFind a community and get involved definitely helps with avoiding the tilting. There are quite a few to check out, I recommend [Sumsoc](https://www.facebook.com/groups/SummonersSocietyOCE/?fref=nf).","replies":[]},{"poster":"Astara","date":"2018-12-25T12:53:45.039+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"If you're on the forums tilted and asking if you should quit, sounds like you don't enjoy enough to play. There are obviously kids on this game who tilt when you flash mastery or point out you outplayed them. Mute if it bothers you, and def report.","replies":[]},{"poster":"UnstopableBTW","date":"2018-12-27T06:02:15.625+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"G leave the game save yourself before you get addicted like i am and literally yell when reading patch notes cause riot cant nerf / fix simple shit","replies":[{"poster":"Astara","date":"2018-12-27T06:22:49.811+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"As a mid silver player, I don't think you really know best on what \"simple shit\" needs to be \"fixed\" tbh","replies":[{"poster":"UnstopableBTW","date":"2018-12-27T07:12:00.824+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"it is simple that even a silver player like me knows wtf to do","replies":[{"poster":"Astara","date":"2018-12-27T07:45:40.116+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"If you knew what to do, you probably wouldn't be in silver.
