Sometimes it takes 3-4 games to get 1 key, and sometimes it even takes 9-10 games. Whenever i get a key and a chest i always go straight to hextech crafting to see what i get. Most of the time i get champion shards that I think wasn&#039;t worth the games i played to get it. Whenever i get skin shards you still need essences to actually get the skin. Sometimes those shards that you got after so many games just ends up being rerolled. \r\n\r\nSo should Rito increase the chance of getting key fragments after games and get better hextech loot?

Sure, a lot of luck is involved and you might get nothing you want but there's also a chance you might end up surprised. I know I've experienced both sides of it and I'm sure everyone does eventually. I mean sure, Rito could be more generous and tune the numbers but I guess I'm just happy it exists at all since I wouldn't' have managed to snag some cool things so far.","replies":[]},{"poster":"4fy9bEOt7y","date":"2016-07-06T02:32:33.302+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I haven't gotten a key shard in like 72 games.
