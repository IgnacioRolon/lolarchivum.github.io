This automated system has just screwed me over for the end of the season because its a bot that doesn't understand context. I'd be happy to be chat banned fair enough but to skip that and go straight to ban on an account that I dont even think has had a single chat ban is ridiculous","replies":[{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2019-11-13T04:56:37.792+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Without the specifics of the punishment I can only give general info, but basically there are some behaviours that can escalate punishments (skip chat restrict tiers).\n\nThese behaviours include (but are not limited to):\n- Gameplay offences (intent feeding, griefing, etc)\n- Hate speech (racism, sexism, homophobia, etc)\n- Suicide encouragement (\"kys\", etc)\n- Threats\n\nIf you feel that none of those apply, then you can probably appeal to support for a reduction in punishment, but the result is up to their discretion. There are other factors that could contribute to an escalation.\n\nhttps://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/requests/new\n\nIf you want specific feedback on your individual case, then your best bet is to post the chat logs and any other relevant info (like punishment history).

That alone probably wouldn't result in punishment on its own (though do bear in mind my comment about the first game), however:\n2. Mature content. This game is rated M (or about 13+). In other words, it is rated in essence as suitable for children and constant explicit sexual content is *not okay* in that public setting.\n\n___\n\nNow, having considered all of this, you *might* have a case for *reduction*. I would say given what was said, some form of punishment standing is basically guaranteed, but there may be a possibility of a switch to a chat restriction. This depends almost entirely on what triggered the escalation.\n\nUnder normal circumstances, I would say that it was likely the use of homophobic slurs is what resulted in escalation to a 14-day ban, however, the presence of explicit, detailed, and prevalent mature content may also warrant that escalation. It's not something that comes up often, so not something I have a huge amount of experience with.\n\nMature content isn't on the list of \"things that typically cause escalation\", but that doesn't mean it doesn't fall into the category of \"things that *can* escalate\". \n\n___\n\nMy advice:\n\n1. Ticket player support and request a reduction under the understanding that a chat restriction is probably warranted but the escalation was a bit of a grey area. Accept that the answer may still be no. \n\n2. Understand that this game is not rated MA or higher, and if you wouldn't say it in front of a room full of pre-teens, don't say it in-game.\n\n3. Respect that in-game chat isn't just talking to your mate, and that it is essentially a public space. Keep the private or more inside joke stuff to voice chat or whispers.","replies":[{"poster":"SirKaioken","date":"2019-11-13T08:31:51.132+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thank you for you're help, I'll submit a ticket and ask for a reduction.\nAppreciate it &lt;3","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Fireball202","date":"2019-11-13T06:08:22.978+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Same thing happened to me, i sent a ticket to riot and asked for a human to respond to it.
