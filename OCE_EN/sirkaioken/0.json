The only reason dominion was removed was because not a lot of new players played it but with a new map I'd think it could make a comeback, doesn't have to have the same rules and game-type as the crystal scar but something similar could be good","replies":[{"poster":"Slim Chaedi","date":"2014-12-16T15:52:15.252+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"True actually.
