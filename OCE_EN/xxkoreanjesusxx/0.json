Not once have I ever modded a game, let alone in a competitive multiplayer game, as I have too much respect for the community and the game as a whole. So riot please, I implore you to help me through this, as I have never hacked nor cheated in any game.\n\nI would really appreciate if someone from Riot would help me by sending me the exact details of the occasion where I got the ban.\n\nThanks for reading.","replies":[{"poster":"SephirothSG","date":"2016-02-24T05:44:51.071+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey there,\n\nSorry to hear you were banned, however we on the boards are unable to assist you as this is an account related issue.\n\nYou'll need to [submit a ticket](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/requests/new) to Player Support to discuss the details of your ban and/or appeal your ban.","replies":[]}]}
