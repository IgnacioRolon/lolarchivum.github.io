If that's the case then you should contact Riot support, which can be found here: https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us\n\nIf, however, you were the player to leave in the match that was remade then the system is working as intended. The remake feature wasn't added so players could restart a match they weren't happy with or where they had screwed up their choice of runes, masteries or summoner spells and if that's what you're using it for then that constitutes abuse of the system, which you will more than likely receive harsher punishments for.\n\nIn regards to reports not doing anything, this simply isn't true. If a player gets reported and they've done the wrong thing then action will be taken against them. Keep in mind that you, as a player, likely wont be able to see anything actually happen to them, since you don't have access to any of the resources that will tell you, without a doubt, whether a player has received punishment. Also keep in mind that the instant feedback system, which notifies players when someone they reported was punished, will (currently) only notify you if your were the most recent report before their punishment. Riot has stated they want to change that but there's been no news in regards to that that I'm aware of.\n\nIf you feel that the in-game/post-game report wasn't enough or that action hasn't been taken against a previous report you have the option to contact support through the link I provided before. Keep in mind, though, that you'll more than likely get a generic response about how they will review the situation and punish the player appropriately.","replies":[]}]}
