I'd played on patch 5.5 but then I opened the patch a few days ago and it began patching again. When it reached 99% an error came up that read, \"Unspecified error occurred. Please check the logs for more information.\" I didn't have a fix to this problem, but the next day when I opened the Patcher it just continuously scanned files. Now whenever I open the client it begins patching until around 85% and then the client freezes and crashes. I've tried a few things to fix but nothing as worked so far after 3 days of being unable to get past the Patching screen.","replies":[]},{"poster":"HORSE OF FORCE","date":"2015-03-20T06:44:42.004+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Sometimes hot-fixes are released while a patch is out, some of them requiring your entire game files to be read. If your patcher is 'scanning' files, and no error message appears, just hold it out; it'll work eventually.","replies":[]}]}
