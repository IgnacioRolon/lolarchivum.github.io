In pre-30 VS AI and ARAM you get lots of bots because people use them to level accounts for sale. I'd suggest reporting them for suspected bot use.\nAs for getting Graves twice in a row, that can happen with probability and is more likely the less champs you have. I remember one time I got Maokai 3 ARAMs in a row.","replies":[{"poster":"Ghazan","date":"2015-01-25T23:21:49.770+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"it just seems strange that in both games everyone of them was playing like bots i highly doubt theyd all be doing it","replies":[{"poster":"Project Xayah","date":"2015-01-25T23:30:14.189+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Actually, I wouldn't be surprised if they all were. There are a significant amount of 'bot accounts' in pre-30 games, it's not that uncommon to get a game where most the players are using bots.","replies":[]}]}]}]}
