What do you guys think?","replies":[{"poster":"Tweekerz","date":"2015-05-16T21:57:57.305+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Maybe they should just roll with a pacific theme since most OCE region is in the pacific ocean. You have plenty of champions to cover this theme too. and it can be colourful and cool, like *hint hint* pacific fizz or nami. Could even say kog and have him all coral but he has a deep sea skin. Even like a pacific nautilus where he just has a scuba suit, flippers and snorkel.","replies":[{"poster":"IHW","date":"2016-04-01T01:34:20.940+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You mean  _Deep Sea Kog'Maw_?","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"NinthCoffin","date":"2015-05-16T09:09:06.465+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Outback Renekton. _Come on_","replies":[{"poster":"Ghazan","date":"2015-05-16T09:16:14.132+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"thats only relevant to australia though not the rest of the continent","replies":[{"poster":"NinthCoffin","date":"2015-05-16T13:01:38.713+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"So, a skin to cover Australia, NZ, the Australasian islands, and Indonesia/Papua Naw Guinea?\n\n_Come on._","replies":[{"poster":"Ghazan","date":"2015-05-16T19:16:58.725+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"like i said, maybe some of the larger ethnicities","replies":[{"poster":"Ez Is Bae","date":"2016-04-01T05:57:48.482+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Australian/European-Australians are the larger ethnic group.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"IHW","date":"2016-04-01T01:35:55.946+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"We are a continent mate.
