What graphics driver do you use? When did you last update it? It could be a graphics issue, where the game is simply not starting to load.\n\nThat's just a possibility. It could genuinely be that the client is failing to connect to the servers for whatever reason. What ISP are you with?","replies":[]},{"poster":"Vapid","date":"2015-04-27T11:59:38.652+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"This happened to me the other day and no amount of client restarts and router restarts would fix it. It wasn't firewall related but I couldn't reconnect to a game without it saying \"you have been disconnected.\nI ended up getting leaverbusted and stuck with a 10 min lower priority queue for 5 games, sent support a ticket and I just ended up being told they couldn't do anything about it but if I'm having connection issues they can help. Kinda hard to have connection issues and be able to submit an online ticket on the same computer that wouldn't connect to league. I gave up arguing and just played 5 AI games since getting them to rescind a leaverbuster restriction even if the issue was on their end is about as easy as eating soup with chopsticks.\nBetter off just staying off the game for a few hours and trying a custom game before you try again, in case you get the same treatment I did I think.","replies":[]}]}
