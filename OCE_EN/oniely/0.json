Jungle wanted to start top side jungle camps. and Top swear to Jungle to start bottom side, and the Top act like he&#039;s leashing and took red.\n-&gt; Jungle X Top swear &amp; argue each other by at the end of the game, Mid AFK\n\n2. We were loosing but still could&#039;ve take down. but the Jungler start to swear and act like he&#039;s given up. &quot;i&#039;m done.&quot; &quot;gg&quot; &quot;gg&quot; &quot;gg&quot; till the end (same jungle above, second game yea, met him twice in a row). which makes teammates frustrating and don&#039;t want to play.\nI really wanted to say something like, \"that's why you are bronze forever.\" But didn't mention anything.. :P\n\n3. Pick nunu and following Jungler all the time to troll, then our mid, who is jungler&#039;s best friend, running around the whole map and feed.\n\nnever been to bronze game before, and it&#039;s really frustrating thing.\nI heard these things before, but having a REAL EXPERIENCE is much more than i thought.","replies":[{"poster":"SOOM","date":"2017-09-26T21:25:10.681+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"If you are good you can solo carry bronze games easily and have 100% winrate..","replies":[]},{"poster":"MÄ± Ke","date":"2017-09-26T17:25:38.179+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Well, I guess the best solution is you have to carry the game yourself. \nIn general, at bronze level, even people have a huge lead, they will start losing it slowly as the game proceeds because they pretty much don't know what to do after laning phrases, and purposelessly run around the map. \nMy advice is to destroy your lane and roam others to help. You can easily do this by consistently playing mid-lane and top-lane","replies":[]},{"poster":"Tink Tink","date":"2017-09-26T07:32:35.924+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Welcome to the bottom of the barrel.","replies":[]}]}
