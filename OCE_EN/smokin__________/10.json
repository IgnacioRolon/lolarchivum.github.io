Add me in game if your interseted\r\n\r\nWhat do i play?\r\nWell for some time now i have been mainly playing bot lane. Barely leaving i find myself with a great knowledge of both roles and believe that i am pretty much very good at both. However i have been supporting for a while longer then i have been going adc and would find that role more comfortable. However with me being able to do both i do not mind you being and adc or support because it works out fine.\r\nWhat i expect from you ?\r\nI am looking for a competent gamer that plays nightly. I also would like it if you have a decent headset for communication and skype or Ts is a must. One or the other is ok im not really phased jsut as long as we have a good way of communication. If you dont have a headset dont bother messaging me anyway. I am a very dedicated player, i regularly play league. \r\n\r\nAny other requirements will be sorted in game.","replies":[{"poster":"Whiteneko","date":"2014-12-04T14:13:26.766+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I would be interested to duo with you.
