Been playing alot of league and have been searching for a serious ranked team for a while but haven't seemed to find some competent playing that are actually keen on playing. I play roughly 4-7 hours a day as im now on holidays i have alot of spare time and like to waste it away by playing this game :). I am  a support/adc main, i rarely step foot out of the botlane roles so i feel very confident with both but have been maining support longed then adc so i would have to give that my first pref. Just add me and msg me in game if you would like me to try for your team and just see how i play. I do have skype and teamspeak and unlike most i also have a decent headset for better communication.","replies":[{"poster":"Frost09","date":"2015-01-05T01:49:16.383+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey man I'm adc/supp main aswell I have recently got this account off a friend it was bronze 5 when I started on my na account it is plat 5 I'm crazy vayne player btw","replies":[]}]}
