They would be based off of Tron Legacy. Zed would be red/orange (or whatever the color that Clu is in it), and Ekko blue.\r\n\r\nZed&#039;s Q could be like one of the discs from Tron Legacy, his shadow could be replaced with a hologram, his e could have particles similar to Ekko&#039;s, and his ult would create a hologram ghost, and, instead of rising from a shadow in the ground, Zed could appear from a portal similar to the portals in Portal. Instead of that shuriken that floats over the head of targets of his R when they&#039;re going to die, it could be one of the said discs, and it could have a robotic voice-over, new robotic sounds, and his R&#039;s explosion could sound robotic and mechanical.\r\n\r\nIt would basically be the same with Ekko, except his R&#039;s trail would be like a lightcycle trail and his W would look like a giant disc or something?\r\n\r\nBoth of them would have death animations of derezzing into little blocks.","replies":[{"poster":"RLG Shaky","date":"2015-06-03T02:33:52.282+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"original.  ლ(ಠ益ಠლ)","replies":[]},{"poster":"kJs","date":"2015-06-02T20:56:46.906+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Soo.\nProject: Zed\nProject: Ekko","replies":[]}]}
