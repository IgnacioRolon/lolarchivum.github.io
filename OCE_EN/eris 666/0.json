Like man how is it fair that they have an adc and we don&#039;t? Or a mid laner, or a tank. It frustrates me that I go 17/3 but we lose because we can&#039;t win teamfights. So can riot make it that if you have an AFK on your team, you don&#039;t lose lp. It seems fair to me.","replies":[{"poster":"DarkenedKnight","date":"2015-12-20T05:34:01.536+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Unfortunently implementing such a feature would just cause people to want to abuse it, which would result in creating more people going afk","replies":[{"poster":"Eris 666","date":"2015-12-20T09:00:05.013+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I guess you're right about that","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"CandyVanisClosed","date":"2015-12-20T21:54:56.918+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Dont worry m8 the leave buster is in place all is good....\nDoesn't matter if it stuffs your game up they will get caught in maybe 2years...\nWe are looking into the problem 9months ago...","replies":[]},{"poster":"Rocka","date":"2015-12-19T17:17:24.319+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You have a lower chance of getting at afk on your team. 1 in 4 chance, the enemy team has a 1 in 5 chance.
