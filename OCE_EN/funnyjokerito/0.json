Thats fair, I was given visual warning, and I failed to act accordingly.  But I cant be expected to manoeuvre my invisible box out of the way of her invisible box.\n\nIf you show me the boxes, thats fine i'll try to make them avoid eachother. But I'm not given that information. I take issue with being punished for failing to dodge something that I wasn't told was going to hit me.\n\nLike why doesn't Lux's R have lines on the ground? \nOther abilities in the game that works the same way does. Xerath's Q, Jhin's W, Jinx's W etc. _(Mind you, not like the lines really mean much, as you can see in the video below)_.\n\nWhatever happened to 'Clarity'?\n\nhttps://youtu.be/XVIHxYbYed4?t=175\n\n2:55\nIs this clarity?
