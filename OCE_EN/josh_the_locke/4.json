So here&#039;s the team first:\r\n{{champion:150}} :Top\r\n{{champion:78}} :Jungle\r\n{{champion:268}} :Support\r\n{{champion:18}} : ADC\r\n{{champion:81}} : AP Mid\r\n\r\nSo the combo would be {{champion:150}}  ulting the whole enemy team (if possible) into {{champion:268}} in which he would ult while they were flying, leading to a well aimed {{champion:18}} ult, then to a fully charged {{champion:78}} ult popping the enemy team all back into their base (if it flies that far).  While this is happening, {{champion:81}} would time his ult at the precise moment so that it would hit all of them, (not sure if this works, need proof) then with the help of {{champion:78}} &#039;s ult, they would fly straight back into {{champion:81}} &#039;s ult getting dealt more damage.\r\n\r\nSo here&#039;s my Wombo Combo, I would Like any advice, add-ons or other ideas for other Wombos.\r\n\r\nBTW people have asked how to pronounce my name, it&#039;s pronounced Neo-Roshe as in the word &quot;rose&quot; but with a &quot;shh&quot; sound\r\n\r\nNeoRouge","replies":[{"poster":"JasonWazza","date":"2015-11-28T11:24:33.770+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Apart from that being completely wasteful, i do believe that an Ezreal ult can only hit once (not to mention it would be down to it's 30% damage for the second hit)","replies":[{"poster":"Josh The Locke","date":"2015-11-29T01:46:40.378+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"***","replies":[{"poster":"Talon12","date":"2015-11-29T11:18:37.928+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"i hate this... its copy and pasted twice.
