My best (and most recent) Braum game was a KDA of 3/13/31 (he kills were when I killed the ADC solo, y stuns are op XD)\nI didnt wreck I died a load to save my team, and got a &quot;crap load&quot; of assists, sorry i didnt bother to check my grade, (but I think u can ony get graded when u reach rank 5?) so are the standards different for supps? or is it &quot;rigged.&quot; I just want to know so that I know my goals for my {{champion:201}}  supp","replies":[{"poster":"BarryButcher","date":"2016-01-22T00:42:57.789+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"you need to \"wreck\" relative to that champion. They don't compare a Braum game against a Riven. It compared Braum to other Braum players and sees how well you do in comparison.\n\nI've had plenty of S games with supports.
