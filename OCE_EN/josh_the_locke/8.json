So, he signed the form and entered in the beginners tournament, he was shoved into top lane because all he had was his trusty pocket-knife at the time, and his opponent was the mighty&hellip;&hellip;.GAREN!{{champion:86}}  &ldquo;DEMACIA!!!!&rdquo; yelled Garen as he pounced on Teemo instantly cutting his head off, and after a painful 25 seconds, Teemo re-spawned in full health, only to be killed over and over again by Garen. Eventually his team surrendered at 20 due to Garen crushing everyone with a shout of \"DEMACIA!\"\n\n Now when the match ended and everyone was in the lobby, he looked around and found that everyone was laughing at him. Teemo looked at Tristana (his girlfriend) but she simple shook her head and texted him &ldquo;it&rsquo;s over.&rdquo; Later that night he was on his bed and he cried and cried, swearing revenge on all that judged him, he screamed as he was trying to kill himself with his knife, but due to the fact that he was quite weak, he couldn&rsquo;t even stab himself! Then a voice spoke out, offering great power in exchange for part of his soul and humanity, of course he accepted and was then transported into Satan&rsquo;s lair. There, he was given a pipe which shot out darts forged from the burning abyss, but to everyone but him it looked like regular darts, he was also given Hell seeds, which exploded on the spot, but to everyone they looked like &ldquo;shrooms\". so he set off again, against Garen on top once again, his teammates kept saying don&rsquo;t feed but little did that know that teemo wouldn&rsquo;t feed, but  instead feast on Garens body.\n\nSo the match started, Teemo got instant first blood, and when Garen returned, he looked for his rag doll but all he found was a blood trail leading to Teemo, and that was when he saw the Devil in him. He screamed and ran for his life, but teemo simply threw his &ldquo;shroom&rdquo; and that burned Garen to death. Everyone never knew what happened to Garen or Teemo, but they knew something had changed about Teemo. This is why he is sooooooo annoying! \n\nAnd that&rsquo;s also why Teemo can counter Garen! :)\n\nThis is the true story of&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;..\n\n\n\n                                                                                    {{champion:17}} **TEEMO**{{champion:17}}\n\n\n\n\n\nPls comment and tell me how i can improve my story, if you guys want i can write up another one \n\nAnd remember! kill TEEMO!={{summoner:11}} {{champion:17}} {{item:3151}} ","replies":[{"poster":"CHEESYLEEKS","date":"2015-06-24T18:03:35.282+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"teemo - the ward","replies":[]}]}
