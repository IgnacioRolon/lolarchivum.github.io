I don&#039;t know why but i&#039;m sure I didn&#039;t do very well in my placements nor my score was any good. I did play all support {{champion:16}} {{champion:10}} {{champion:1}} {{champion:26}} in my placements though (cause i&#039;m pretty bad to be honest) but even then it feels weird to get a rating i feel like I didn&#039;t exactly deserve.\r\n\r\nI did the exact same thing on **Ranked Flex** surprisingly got **3 wins 7 loss** as well I don&#039;t know how but it was weird and this time I got **Bronze I**{{sticker:sg-ahri-1}} \r\n\r\nIf anybody can tell me how and why this happens that would be great cause I am new to ranked cause what i heard is if your score is good even if you lose you get placed higher than if it was winning helps.\r\n\r\nYe my G bro Chur Bye.","replies":[]}
