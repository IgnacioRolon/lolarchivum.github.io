Can we get a similar update on gem stone skins? Like wise I've had 10 for a while now not knowing to spend them or not, and gemstones are arguably harder to obtain. Would be extremely helpful. Thanks!","replies":[{"poster":"Lord Sesshomaru","date":"2019-09-25T07:50:04.679+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"I couldn’t agree more.\n\nEspecially seeming there have been ‘limited time’ gemstone skins in the past _(Neo Pax Sivir)._\n\nI feel uneasy having less than 10 gemstones sitting in my inventory, just incase a ‘limited time’ Swain or Azir etc. skin pops up.  And the only other way to get it is to drop several hundred on chests _(or buy a plane ticket to America for Pax or whatever event is linked to the skin)_ neither option is really a possibility.","replies":[]}]}
