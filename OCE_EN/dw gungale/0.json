To put it simply. The badge will indicate the skin was purchased during the original release of the skin. Anyone that purchases the skin during re-releases or mystery gifts will not have this badge. \r\n\r\nAlternatively we could add a glow and shimmer effect to Legacy skin users that purchased the skin during the original release. So in game the skin will have a slightly shinier effect than the skin would normally have.\r\n\r\nThese ideas combat the that lose of bragging rights for saying, &quot;look at me, I have this awesome skin from season 1&quot; etc. \r\n\r\nThoughts?","replies":[{"poster":"Infected Walnut","date":"2015-09-16T23:45:22.621+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"a) they already have that for limited skins\nb) legacy skins are supposed to come back every so often, so complaining about them is idiotic.","replies":[{"poster":"DW GunGale","date":"2015-09-16T23:48:14.207+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I know they have the stripe effect over the limited skins but that isn't for the originals.

I don't have the stripe effect for them.","replies":[{"poster":"DW GunGale","date":"2015-09-17T02:31:11.493+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Oh cool.
