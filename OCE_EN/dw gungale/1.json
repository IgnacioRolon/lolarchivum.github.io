Reading a thread post recently about verbal abuse and my own past history with the League community has prompted me to writing this post. I would like to remind everyone that this is indeed a game but at the same time it is a community. That mean&#039;s that behind the other 9 champions in any given game is a real person. With real feelings. Let&#039;s be nice to one another instead of putting each other down. The League community should be building each other up not trying to tear each other apart. \n\nI encourage anyone that reads this to be as nice as they can to their fellow players from this point onwards. Be supportive and understanding when someone makes a mistake in game. Give them advice on how to play better and reduce the chances of making the same mistake. Give kudos when someone does an exceptional play. Sincerely try and make the game a good game so that when the game does end and you say GG it actually means something rather than just saying it for the sake of saying it. I&#039;ve truly had games that were exceptionally good because everyone in it was playing well and was nice to each other. The game lasted an hour long because of how equal the teams were. But the main source of enjoyment I got out of this game was because of the friendliness of not just my team but the enemy too. Everyone was commending each other on various plays and laughing about their mistakes. No trash talking. No derogatory comments. Just good sportsmanship.\n\nLet&#039;s make this a friendlier community! Let&#039;s be nice! \n\nHave a good day.\n\n***\n\nRegards,\nCrown [@crownoce](http://www.twitter.com/crownoce)","replies":[{"poster":"Maraudaur","date":"2015-09-10T00:05:46.470+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":0,"body":"Great post!

What blows my mind is when people meet other gamers or other League players IRL, they instantly bond. They have something to talk about and it's like they were friends all along. But when you are playing League, with other people who love the game just as much as you, you treat them like trash. Why? It boggles the mind that you would treat someone this way.\n\nGiving advice is great, but sometimes when people are having an off game they get angry and may not always take advice the best. If that's the case, saying to your team mates \"hey, it's ok, we all have off games, we got this\" can sometimes help. If they get defensive, don't get defensive back saying you were only trying to offer help, that's adding fuel to the fire.\n\nKeep a smile on your dial, remember that those are real people and that we, as a community, always need to support each other. Hell, if we just keep raging and being mean to each other, we are just becoming more and more like the stereotype that mainstream media plays us out to be. That's not true gamers.","replies":[{"poster":"TeCoolMage","date":"2015-09-10T16:54:03.320+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The sad truth is that MoBAs are in the context of toxicity and people are more likely to do wrong things if a specific context allows it.\n\n\nTotallyNotCopiedFromRito","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Icarus1314","date":"2016-03-30T02:20:34.559+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Well said\n\nSadly some people likes to hide behind the monitor and act like a cuxt coz they no nothing will happen to them...\nSo cyber bully will not stop...\nThanks to those people","replies":[]},{"poster":"lThatFallenAngel","date":"2016-03-29T15:22:33.213+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"*clap clap clap*\nthat well well-said","replies":[]},{"poster":"TeCoolMage","date":"2015-09-10T16:56:37.350+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I wish there was a system that would gray out a button to leave the after-game screen until you say something nice.

I tell him to try dashing on minions twice before dashing onto me then using q mid dash to me, then to dash back out again and wait for the cd to die off before attempting to dash me again (dashing for more damage before hitting me, then dashing away to safety), while doing the most damage he can in a short time, while only taking minimal damage. He just gets all worked up because my \"help\" is apparently toxic. So he stats raging all game, just because I gave him a tip to help him use yasuo.\n\nSo, in the end I just mute them and give up on them.","replies":[]},{"poster":"ArataHaruki","date":"2015-09-10T01:31:39.265+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Unfortunately when push comes to shove only a handful of people end up thinking this way,","replies":[]},{"poster":"GigaPube","date":"2015-09-10T01:10:29.017+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"if only....","replies":[]}]}
