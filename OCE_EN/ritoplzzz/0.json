I am expecting some of you to flare up and get all defensive this will tell me two things 1. that its a touchy subject to you which is suspicious and questionable 2. you are one of thoses idiots that think just saying \"its cause you suck\" will block me,\"  theres still 4 other roles that \"could\" do well but surprisingly 9/10 times wont...all 4 other roles 1234. 90% of the time these roles will NOT be filled with a skilled enough summoner to carry or even just soft carry to a win... where as on the other hand 90% of the time all five roles on the enemy team will be filled with a perfectly balanced team that is clearly a ton more experienced than anyone on the other side, this is taken from a 100 game medium. I know some of you have experienced awkwardly long streaks of suspiciously unfairly matched games, some would say even that RIOT is basically giving your elo away to championship runner ups and other sore losers who will vengefully elo boost an account to plat diamond and sell it to an under skilled noob  that has a couple of hundred bucks spare, that's were my baited elo in this study went I can assure you. im only fighting to Give honest humble decent people who are reasonably skilled there chance to bloom and climb the ranks to at least what they REALLY deserve, not B5 for life to accommodate for these people who have a high place in the community and get there elo hand fed to them, people trying to get out of bronze should not have to be subject every 9/10 games to an enemy team that will beat all of your team down to a 15 minute win and do it again 12 times in a row just on a work night. ok so im nearly ready to wrap this up, id like to comment on some things I missed, NA server has vastly improved its matching system, over there my win rate is a ton more positive compared to here on OCE against the same standard of ranked enemies, this is because they have eliminated the server corruption and decreased the boosting of sellable accounts drastically, people over there are actually happy to lose cause they know its a tactic or build floor that they must of done wrong, not the enemy team being given free LP all day by a corrupted server via a rigged selective matchmaking system. OCE staff needs to address this situation cause soon all their over ranked friends wont have any bronze noobs left to leech elo from and they might actually have to try win against someone their own skill level which we know will result in a rise in RAZORBLADE and ROPE sales. thankyou","replies":[{"poster":"HORSE OF FORCE","date":"2014-12-27T02:11:09.836+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"> I put some money together with a friend searched on ebay and invested in a low gold oce account off a pro elo booster.\n\ninb4 perma-banned\n\n> In my study I have come to many suspicious conclusions and possibilities that involve\n\nHave you done seventh grade science reports?
