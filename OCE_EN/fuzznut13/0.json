Then his passive got nerfed against jungle creeps so he has slow clears now.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Brilliant","date":"2015-02-16T04:38:18.744+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I've only been around since Preseason 3. But I'll communicate my observations.\n\n\nChampions\n\nWhen I first started new champion releases were a lot more common. However, The complexity of the designs of the newer champions in regards to mechanics somewhat eclipses the champions that were being released i earlier seasons. I attribute this to the changing attitudes of riot from a rapidly expanding game to a game where their primary focus is on retaining current players by introducing new gameplay.\n\n\nMetagame\n\nBack in the day, even though I was pretty crap (preseason 3) the \"current\" meta, 1 top, 1 mid, 2 bot, 1 jungle was still the go. However, I find the mechanical and strategical metagame has evolved and developed. In terms of mechanics, the editions of windwalls (Yasuo, Braum) and heavy cc supports that create new limits to mechanical prowess (thresh etc.) have transformed the game, in particular, the battle for objectives such as dragon and baron. In regards to strategy, the quality of professional play has increased exponentially with micromanagement skills now front and centre of competitive play. I frankly feel its a massive feat for xPeke (a season 1 champ) to still be competitive after so long, that mans adaptation to play has to be congratulated. \n\n\nEsports\n\nThis has definitely been the biggest improvement since preseason 3 and currently. When I first started the whole NALCS was such a new concept, no one was sure if it was going to work. But now, EU and NA LCS are staples of competitive gameplay. In regards to Oceania, we didn't even have a server back when I first started. The Opening of the Oceania server in July of 2013 truly did herald in a new age for Oceanic players. No longer were we handicapped by a 150+ ping, allowing our movements to be quicker, more precise and most importantly, opening the stage for the development of the Oceanic E-sports Scene. Originally the Oceanic scene was just a couple of minor competitions such as Cybergamer and whatnot. Now, competitions backed by Riot advertising and funding are drawing crowds of people. While there are skeptics about the Oceania scene, people need to remember, the Season 1 world championships had 100 people in attendance. Our most recent Oceanic regional finals had over a thousand! With thousands more viewing online. This year with the introduction of the Oceanic Pro League, we harald in yet another step towards a full blown competitive scene in Oceania, and tonight, I will watch the Oceanic Pro League, on the 52\" Plasma TV in my loungeroom, in my unit eating pizza with my girlfriend and friends; Just like all previous Oceanic Pro League nights (and future ones to come). The next natural progressive step for our Oceanic scene is a direct entry into the worlds without having to progress through wildcards. (LETS SEE THIS HAPPEN BENJI!)\n*I have attached a photo comparison of the World championships from season 1 to 4.*\n\n\nAttitudes\n\nSadly, this is an aspect of the game that has degraded while the game has evolved - the attitudes of players. When I began playing people were helpful and friendly. Now I watch my girlfriend trying to learn the ins and outs of the game, her chat filled with death threats and downright disgusting remarks. She has actually been reduced to tears a number of times. I truly believe this change in attitude is a result of the threat of the tribunal no longer lingering above toxic player's heads. Toxic players in game genuinely have the attitude that the chance of getting picked up and banned by Riot is next to nothing and as a result feel they can be disgusting towards other players. Yes, this is the internet, people hide behind names and play keyboard warriors for a laugh, but those are real people on the receiving end. This is my personal opinion: Riot should perm ban abusive accounts without warning or prior ban. People might have fake names, but they've put real money into the game, and if their money were under threat, I think players might think twice before being toxic. \n\n\nSo this kind of turned into a long post, but hopefully it's full of information for you, have fun!","replies":[{"poster":"Fuzznut13","date":"2015-02-23T02:12:57.525+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Look a big thanks man this was actually a huge help, thanks :)","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Fuzznut13","date":"2015-02-23T02:09:45.026+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey guys thanks for the helpful comments :) very appreciated","replies":[]},{"poster":"Best Viktor AU","date":"2015-02-16T11:37:59.400+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Back in the day you could stack so much items like Bloodthirsters or even better Hextech Revolver (katarina ult when enemy has no CC = never ending healing) and their were some funny items like Cloak and Dagger made from a Cloak and a Dagger.\n\nAlso the map looks better.\n\nSomething that has changed is champion balance where back in the days a jax could 1v5 because his E was when he was attacked he had a chance of an aoe stun and also AP Yi (you will be missed).","replies":[]},{"poster":"Critterous","date":"2015-02-16T08:23:56.305+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I joined league in late Season 2 but here's what i got:\n\nBack in the day you didn't have a Yasuo doing a 1v5 pentakill...

A lot of champiosn had pretty long lores, and those have been decreased, while some newer ones never had a long one. In addition, we used to have a lot of stuff like the Journal of Justice and such, which have just disappeared. We get an odd video here and there about new champions coming in, but nothing on the ones which already exist. The lore has reached a stagnant point, where everything just now is as it is. Riot is only really building on it when they are required to.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Dean Pervert","date":"2015-02-16T03:04:10.372+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The champion designs and just the game in general from the interface to the item design is a lot more polished and measured than it was in season 1.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Urgot Bot","date":"2015-02-16T02:57:27.886+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I want to say something witty about this but I can't.
