I&#039;m speaking of the new Super Galaxy skins, the idea of family skins was quaint at first but the store is overflowing with family set skins and no new fresh ideas/skins, I&#039;d like some more diverse range of skins to pick and choose from and this is one of the reasons I have not purchased any RP in a long while and one of the reasons why I left the game during season 5. \n\nAnother problem I have with the current wave of skins that have come out are the prices, seriously the recent skins that have come out total to 28 which all cost 1350+ (not including team or champion skins since they came out in the past) stopping at Chemtech Tryndamere which is followed by another 7 1350+ skins. I remember back in the day (when Sword of the Divine was out (bring back SotD)) when an average (which was still a good skin) would cost 975 period, and skins with more effects including recall animations custom emotes etc would cost 1350+. \n\nStop making quick buck skins like the Worldbreaker series, the splash arts look bad-ass but the in-game models are bland with no custom animations or effects making the skin not even worth the 750 for me. \n\nI remember walking to the closest EB Games and purchasing a $10 prepaid RP card with my golden coins I&#039;d been saving for the past two weeks, I open up League and purchase that brand new Teemo skin that came out and since I had a little RP left over from the last time I bought $10 of RP I could afford a team icon I picked the season 3 NiP team logo. Nowadays I need to purchase a $20 prepaid card to be able to afford one of the recent decent skins that have come out. I&#039;ve got 2250 RP from my $20 RP card and I purchase a new 1350 skin that came out, what can I buy with my remaining RP? Oh I have 900 RP left I&#039;ll save it up to purchase a 975, I buy $10 of RP and buy an older 975 skin I have 1025 RP remaining so I&#039;ll save up... and on and on.\n\nTo summarise:\n\n - Make 975 skins the norm again\n\n - Stop making so many Family skins including the cheapo to the expensive (Worldbreaker - Star Guardian)\n\n - Get more consistent art styles for splash arts, (Super Galaxy Elise looks awful along with Eternal Sword Yi (other skins look good such as the Beekeeper Singed skin &#039;mwa* mastapiece&#039;))\n\n - Hurry up and release the rework for Olaf, Skarner and Malphite or at least a graphical update (other champions need graphical updates but by far Olaf is the one that is in dire need for an update)\n\n - Buff Aatrox\n\n - Instead of nerfing champions and removing items from the game ruining some people&#039;s experience BUFF elements to the game to balance out &#039;strong champions, stats or items&#039; such as DFG or SotD someone&#039;s entire calling to the game could be an ability for a champion that they adore or an item that they love and removing them ruins their experience\n\n - Re-introduce Sword of the Divine to the game\n\n\nFinal comments:\n\nSorry for my bad grammar I tried to make this as coherent as possible but may have munted it in the process, thank you for reading.\n\n_-Theo the Goober_\n\n\nEdit: not sure if this belongs in help & support but the topic didn't seem to fall into any of the other categories possibly add a complaint board unless I missed it","replies":[{"poster":"Wuks","date":"2017-10-26T12:46:30.333+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You've got some great ideas! Unfortunately, as you mentioned, the Help & Support board isn't the best place for this sort of discussion.
