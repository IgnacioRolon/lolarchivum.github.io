I believe it&#039;s lag on both server side and my side, is this true? Every time I try to play a ranked game, my first queue attempt will result in a fail and 6 minute ban. Any one else experiencing this?","replies":[{"poster":"Bilsy","date":"2016-02-21T11:39:02.510+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"after switching to a public dns, the problem did not appear again however I noticed that my web pages load slightly slower than before. \n\nalso no, i haven't tried repairing the client","replies":[]},{"poster":"Bilsy","date":"2016-02-16T08:32:46.059+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Okay so I've switched to the 8.8.8.8/ 8.8.4.4 server address (followed the video exactly).
