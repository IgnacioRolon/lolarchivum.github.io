So i get tabbed out, i click on league and then i get tabbed out again. its really annoying especially when it happens in teamfights.\r\nI thought it might be some popup/notification from a program. But I didn&#039;t download any new program recently, and I tried to look at the ones I have installed but I couldn&#039;t find the culprit. and when I get tabbed out I just get to whatever was open (usually my internet browser) and no notification or anything pops up. Hope I can get some help, thanks.","replies":[]}
