Me and the team worked around it and I ended up in bot. We went on the loose the game, mostly because my net dropped but mostly (as you might have guessed) the -{{champion:54}}  wasn&#039;t trying at all. So looking to get on with a better game I hit up a search and end up in a lobby with no other than {{champion:54}} who locks {{champion:30}} this time. And he says to me something along the lines of &#039;oh its Mal again, going to report for toxic&#039;... \r\n\r\nNow to be clear here, I got a bit pissed at him in the prior game. I don&#039;t go keyboard raging or anything but I&#039;ll totally admit to being a bit toxic towards him. Some other people on the team were that way towards him too. Now we&#039;re all in the wrong I totally get that, we all get annoyed etc etc that&#039;s just Lol. But what butters my bread is at the end of the day he&#039;s got a legitimate reason to report me and my team, and what can we do about him... basically nothing. All because instalocking isn&#039;t against the summoners code, so why isn&#039;t it? It doesn&#039;t do anything productive to the team, it only makes people toxic, is annoying as hell, and only makes you lose. So all that considered why isn&#039;t it against the summoers code? If it&#039;s a bad thing why is it allowed to happen?\r\n\r\nSo seeing as instalocking isn&#039;t against the summers code, and ruins games, there&#039;s surely a good reason for this... right?","replies":[{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2015-11-27T12:28:14.070+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Theoretically the new champ select will resolve this without the failings of Team Builder. The new system would have you put in a primary and secondary role or fill, then when you get into ban phase I think there is a way to show intent pick, as in show who you intend to play before you actually get to pick phase.","replies":[{"poster":"Malignus","date":"2015-11-28T05:29:15.044+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Even if it makes a small difference I'll be happy, I play yolo que mostly so anything to improve that is great.

New champ select is going to replace all queues if all goes well, so you have to choose a role before you get into select, so unless you are going in with the intent to troll, in which case you can damn well report them for being an ass, you won't have role conflicts. It removes all of the people who are just \"I'm playing top I don't care what other people do\" for whatever reason. If you're still getting role conflicts then it's because someone is abusing the system to mess with people intentionally and it's a reportable offence.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Zorphiax","date":"2015-11-27T08:17:20.236+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Why should it be against the summoner code?\n\nIf Riot didn't want Summoners to instalock they wouldn't of made a 'lock in' button. Also, who stated within Riot that we MUST follow the Meta, they recommend it yes I also recommend it but if you want to not follow the Meta go ahead just don't complain or be toxic when you have 5 top go ahead just don't get salty when you lose game because no one went to any other lane.\n\nOkay, in your situation this summoner should be either banned or put on pre que delay. But, this isn't instalocking fault, even if instalocking wasn't a thing he was going top no matter what. You can't stop this until it happens then you report don't blame it on instalocking it was a troll. Besides, some Summoners instalock because it saves time and all roles were sorted out.","replies":[{"poster":"Malignus","date":"2015-11-27T11:30:25.714+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It's not the meta, it's how a team works to win a LOL game, they communicate and play together. Sure in normal there's some funny picks as it's normals, but you still need to work a coherent team. So how doesn't instalocking fly in the face of that? Right off the bat your pissing off your team, especially whoever called the lane. They then might be forced into a lane they suck in, this all adds up to you losing. Certainly having a higher proclivity too it. So as far as I'm concerned it is against the meta, and it's just kind of being a tool.\n\nI'll 100% grant you it's a very hard thing to control, and yes it can only be reported at when it happens (unless there was a que system where the team could ditch an instalocker or something) but that's no excuse for not figuring something out. If this was a punishable offence, and was properly enforced, you'd see a quick end to it. Yeah they might go top or wherever, unless it got them banned. I do blame instalocking because it let's people troll, if an instalocker plays a totally normal game, doesn't deed goes well and all that good stuff you can't report them. They get away scott free. \n\nI think you can agree with me when I say there is a solution out there, this totally could be fixed. It's not impossible, and by god would be make Lol better if Riot did something about it. \n\nIt just doesn't make sense to me that they really go for toxic people, even though you can just mute them and they're not a problem any more. But an instalocker, like the guy I mentioned who clearly always does it, just gets to annoy so many people and get away with it. There's something very wrong with that.","replies":[{"poster":"Zorphiax","date":"2015-11-27T12:00:31.666+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Malignus,realm=OCE,application-id=Ntey9fRZ,discussion-id=mLEUMEmR,comment-id=00010000,timestamp=2015-11-27T11:30:25.714+0000)\n>\n> It's not the meta, it's how a team works to win a LOL game, they communicate and play together.

This normally makes trolls stop because they can't troll and they get upset then they troll within game and you have HARD evidence to report them with when they feed or don't communicate with team.\n\n> [{quoted}](name=Malignus,realm=OCE,application-id=Ntey9fRZ,discussion-id=mLEUMEmR,comment-id=00010000,timestamp=2015-11-27T11:30:25.714+0000)\n>\n> It just doesn't make sense to me that they really go for toxic people, even though you can just mute them and they're not a problem any more.

They will get their punishment eventually if Riot can find evidence of the Summoner being a troll.","replies":[{"poster":"Malignus","date":"2015-11-28T05:29:05.094+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Look I'm not disagreeing with you, yes the best and only thing you can do is work around it. Then as you say, if they troll you can report them. But my point is we shouldn't have to do this, and I'm really sick of having to do it. It doesn't ruin Lol, but it's easily one of the things I hate the most about the game. So my point really is, as much as we can, we shouldn't have to just deal with it. Nothing is more annoying going into a game that you know you're going to because of trolls and having to waste so much time. So like I said, it can be worked around but it shouldn't have to be is all I'm saying. \n\nAs for that guy I mentioned yeah I just dodged the lobby, wasn't going to play with him again, and while I can submit a ticket I just feel like it wouldn't do anything. I'll check his match history and depending on that I might do it.\n\nThanks for your thoughts man","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Warau","date":"2015-11-29T11:52:25.861+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Tough question. tbh THIS is a game.

The code states that it is the responsibility of players to communicate with each other, during champ select and in-game, to formulate a strategy (and something about making friends), though not in so many words. By instalocking, a person is leaving no room for communication (and potentially ruining the fun of other players, another thing that is against the summoners code). Just because \"instalocking\" isn't explicitly mentioned doesn't mean it's not condemned by the code.","replies":[]}]}
