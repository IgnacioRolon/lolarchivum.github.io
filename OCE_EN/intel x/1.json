You carry a negative attitude pretty much throughout the whole game. Assuming a history of negative behaviour, this would be plenty to net you a punishment in the next tier. For context, punishments usually follow four tiers:\n\n* 10 game chat restriction\n\n* 25 game chat restriction\n\n* 14 day ban\n\n* Permanent ban\n\nSome behaviours like hate speech or gameplay toxicity (intent feeding, griefing etc) can skip you straight to 14 day ban though I doubt that is the case here unless your chat was accompanied with gameplay toxicity. If you've been punished before then this would essentially be the continuation. \n\n___\nIf you haven't been punished before then likely your punishment was escalated where it shouldn't have been, as this would really only be worthy of a chat restriction assuming no prior offenses and no gameplay toxicity. If that is the case I would recommend submitting a ticket to player support:\nhttps://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/requests/new","replies":[{"poster":"Intel x","date":"2017-12-05T03:32:52.764+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You highlight all the negative parts and say I'm negative throughout the whole game, I'm not sure how you can make this claim seeing as there a no time stamps and the first half of the text is mainly positive for a soloque game.\n\nI'm not saying its okay to flame but I'm only human and what 3 of the members on my team were saying to me got to me, if you could see the whole chat log just not mine it would be easier to see but unfortunately you can't.\n\nThanks for the feedback","replies":[{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2017-12-05T09:27:00.340+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Throughout all of your time using chat then. For a chat log that long you were either typing a lot in a short period of time or a decent amount throughout pretty much the whole game. GIven the jumps in conversation I made the assumption it was the latter, but if that was not the ccase then I apologise.\n\nBelieve me I understand the \"I'm only human\" aspect. There are limits, especially if you're having not the best day and sometimes it just really gets to you. I won't pretend I've never torn someone apart in chat because they were a royally toxic asshat to me, because I have. Not at all often, but at least a few times over the years.\n\nLike I said in my original comment, if this was your first punishment, I'd recommend appealing it, because for a first punishment with that log I'd say that's definitely too harsh. If it's not your first punishment, then that's why this was so severe. It's essentially warning you that your behaviour is getting out of hand, and that previous punishments have not prompted you to get back on the right track. \n\nYour next punishment will more than likely be a permanent suspension, so I would recommend being very careful of your words for a while. If someone is toxic, just mute them, don't risk your account by stooping to their level.\n___\n\nThere are two things I would prompt you to remember. \n\nThe first is that fuelling the fire doesn't help anyone. I know it's not always easy to step back and see that, but by responding to toxicity you're encouraging them *and* hurting yourself. It really isn't worth it, and if you can keep that in mind the next time someone is an ass and just mute them, they're going to be the ones getting punished, and you'll be free sailing.\n\nThe second is the age old two wrongs don't make a right. It pretty much feeds off my last point as far as not helping the situation, but also, while defending yourself won't be punished, retaliating will be. Just because someone else was toxic doesn't give you the right to be as well. Better to mute and move on than to open yourself up to punishment by risking responding and taking it too far.\n\nWe see a lot of posts here along the lines of \"why did I get punished when they started it?\". So long as you report them, they'll get what's coming to them and face punishment same as you have. They aren't somehow above punishment, they are treated exactly the same as you.","replies":[]}]}]}]}
