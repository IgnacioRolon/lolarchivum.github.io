Assuming you have not been chat restricted before this, you might want to take a shot in the dark and [ask Riot](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/requests/new) to maybe reduce your punishment on this basis, but don't count on it. \n\nKeep in mind that not only is that term just unacceptable to use at all (even in reference), but you have also said _\"rest of you can choke on a fat one\"_ and _\"people like you are shit\"_ (among other things) which are not  acceptable behaviour either. However, I am not Riot so I don't want to rule anything out.\n\nAlso, I may be wrong but it seems like you stopped trying to win for a bit saying _\"fun loss, enjoyt\"_ and then came back with _\"ill help but only for yasuo\"_. If that is the case then there's pretty much no chance of getting this punishment reduced, since attempting to [purposefully loose the game](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752884-Reporting-a-Player#h1q3) is a pretty serious offence.\n\n\n____*\n\nJust as a bit of advice BTW, I strongly recommend you be very careful now because **your next offense will result in a PERMANENT BAN**. The system isn't very forgiving at higher tiers so even something small could result in a ban.\n\nIf I was you I would either, _/mute all_ at the start of every game, unbind the enter key so you can't type in chat, or drag the chat to the side of the screen so it is no longer visible.
