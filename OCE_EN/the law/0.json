Remembrance {{champion:78}} was just an idea and I'm sure there are plenty other champions that it'd work well with too.  I'm not sure how it would look, but I'm sure there's some creative individuals that could develop something that would look fabulous. I only thought of a couple of reasons, and I think there are more, but I think people should get on board with this idea because:\r\n\r\n1. **People that deserve the support get it **and the *donators get something* that they can be proud in return for their donation\r\n2. **Great publicity for League of Legends community.** League is known as a pretty toxic community, but I think that if enough people bought the skin/skins/ward/boarder/whatever and raised lots of money for a charity it'd be pretty amazing and do leaps and bounds for the reputation of the League of Legends community.\r\n\r\nThanks for reading! Because, I believe it {{champion:81}} ly (Is really, yeah i know bad pun :P) important that we give back to the people that sacrificed so much for us so that we have freedom to do anything, even play League with the laggy OCE servers ;)\r\nRegards \r\n The Law","replies":[{"poster":"JasonWazza","date":"2014-12-03T12:09:25.444+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"You realize November 11th was like a month ago yeah?","replies":[]},{"poster":"Luscious Thighs","date":"2014-12-10T08:37:19.422+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"still is a nice idea","replies":[]}]}
