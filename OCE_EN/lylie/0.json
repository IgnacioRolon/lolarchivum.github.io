Ahri walked through the crowded camp, weaving between injured warriors and frantic healers. The sun sank in the distance, the light it brought fading to make way for lengthening shadows.\n\nOnce, in less chaotic times, her mere existence would have turned heads, her charm easily fallen for. But today, the aftermath of the battle against Noxus had shaken the village. No one spared her a glance as she passed.\n\nHer injuries were already healed. She shouldn&rsquo;t even _be_ here, but the heavy presence of leaking life force had been too irresistible. Standing among all those wounded humans, she had never felt so unbelonging―like a fish out of water.\n\nAnd then she saw him.\n\nAn unfamiliar man sat unmoving under the shadows of a tree a fair distance away from all the other warriors―perhaps he liked the seclusion. The bandages around his arms and body were soaked red with blood, a mark of his involvement in the battle. Ahri frowned. She hadn&rsquo;t seen him in the village before. \n\nThinking he at least deserved gratitude for helping them repel the Noxian invaders, she approached him.\n\nHis chest heaved with steady breaths and his eyes remained closed even after she took the seat next to him. To any normal human, he appeared asleep. Ahri knew better. She heard his rapid heart rate pound faintly, beating too fast for him to be asleep.\n\n&ldquo;Hello.&rdquo; The word still felt weird on her tongue after all those months of being human.\n\nSilence followed. He opened a single, red eye wearily. &ldquo;What?&rdquo;\n\n&ldquo;I thought you looked lonely,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re not from this village, are you?&rdquo;\n\nHe snorted. &ldquo;No.&rdquo; \n\nAn air of mystery hung over him, Ahri noticed. She wondered where he came from. His black attire resembled the uniform worn by ninjas she&#039;d often seen visit the village―perhaps he belonged to their club, order, or whatever. A small smile flitted across her face as she said a line she&#039;d been rehearsing since their conversation started: &ldquo;I fought in the battle too, you know. We couldn&rsquo;t have won it without outside help.&rdquo;\n\nAnother snort. &ldquo;Judging by your lack of wounds, you&rsquo;re a sorceress?&rdquo;\n\n_No, I&rsquo;m a fox turned human._  &ldquo;Something like that.&rdquo;\n\nHe actually _looked_  at her now. Her eyes were the colour of sunlight. His were as red as the fires raging beneath the earth. At that moment, they seemed placid, like the calm before the storm. He blinked slowly. &ldquo;No sorcery can beat me.&rdquo; A childish assumption.\n\nShe laughed a laugh as soft as bells, pleased to see his face redden considerably. &ldquo;Want to see what a real mage can do?&rdquo;\n\nHe hesitated as if contemplating. Ahri could see her effect on him―the effect she had on mostly everyone. His tense features loosened and his eyes clouded for a second, relenting to her gaze. She imagined he was weighing his options.\n\n&ldquo;Alright.&rdquo;\n\nExcitement fluttered in Ahri. Without a second thought, she called upon the fox spirit deep within her, closing her eyes and reaching deep within the man&rsquo;s essence where his darkest memories lurked.\n---\n\n✣ _***A different twilight, in a different lifetime***_ ✣\n\n_Zed. His name was Zed, the Master of Shadows._\n\n_He repeated that name again and again, the very sound of it an anchor to sanity. The shadows around him rose and weaved around his rival as if they had a life of their own―but he knew they were just puppets, and he their puppeteer._\n\n_Breathing heavily with adrenaline, he channelled his last ounce of energy into another shadow technique. Shurikens erupted in a violent whirlwind around Shen, piercing but not fatally harming him. He saw his once-equal rival collapse, choking blood onto the ground. He saw his master&rsquo;s eyes widen slightly from the corner of his vision―in recognition?_\n\n_Last and most satisfying of all, he witnessed the old ninja arts fall to his shadows. A laugh escaped him―a maniacal, triumphant howl edged with insanity._\n\n_His master stood up. Zed grinned, preparing himself to be praised. Surely he deserved it this time. Surely, after defeating Shen―_\n\n_&ldquo;Zed.&rdquo; The master&rsquo;s voice was a mere whisper, but it echoed across the courtyard with the deafening gravity of authority. &ldquo;Where did you learn such arts?&rdquo;_\n\n_Zed&rsquo;s ecstasy faded along with his shadows, eaten away by confusion. &ldquo;Master?&rdquo;_\n\n_The entire order―trainees and veterans were quiet, all of them staring at Zed as if he was some kind of monster. Shen writhed on the ground. &ldquo;Father. He didn&rsquo;t kill me―&rdquo;_\n\n_&ldquo;Forbidden techniques call for banishment,&quot; the master, said cutting his son off.  &quot;Don&rsquo;t come near this temple again or my ninjas will dispose of you. Jia, please escort Zed out to the gates.&rdquo;_\n\n_Banished?_\n\n_The word cascaded down like a heavy rock, and it took him a moment to comprehend its meaning before his world shattered. Long shadows flickered alive, twisting towards him protectively as a woman―Jia―approached. She reached out a hand and he shuddered, backing away from it._\n\n_&ldquo;Zed―&rdquo; Eyes flashing warningly, she grabbed his shoulder with force._\n\nNo. I won&rsquo;t be disgraced like this―\n\n_With one swift movement, misty shurikens leapt out of his hands. The shot towards Jia, aiming for her heart._\n\n_Black became red as blood rained down._\n\n_Her body crumpled and dropped like a ragged doll. _\n\n_He_ killed _her. The realisation hit him and for a moment, he dared to feel guilty and horrified at what he had done. Jia―his fellow comrade, dead at_ his _hands. Any euphoric happiness he felt earlier from his duel with Shen evaporated, replaced by a surging anger._\n\n_There was no going back now._\n\n_The order watched, horror-struck. The master rose quickly, regarding Zed like a dangerous animal meant to be tamed._\n\n_They had banished him. No longer did Zed consider them a family. He felt like a ghost of a thunderstorm; his thunder stolen and his lightning gone._\n\n_Sparing them a last, loathing glance, he disappeared into the shadows, surrendering his soul to the darkness._\n\n---\n\n✣ _***Midnight***_ ✣\n\nThe scene faded. A hand pulled Ahri back into the real world, dragging her out of the haunting memory. She felt as if she&rsquo;d been submerged in water for a lifetime. The forest fragrance returned to her, mingled with the ashen scent of camp fires burning and the sour odour of blood.\n\nA shiver ran through her. The air seemed colder, more wrought with tension.\n\nShe hesitantly opened her eyes to see Zed glaring at her, his eyes as tempestuous as a storm&rsquo;s fury. The scene of Jia&rsquo;s death at his hands replayed in her mind, and she fought the urge to scamper back, away from those bloodied hands. His attire made sense now. He _was_ a part of their order―not anymore. _He murdered his own comrades._\n\n&ldquo;_Leave_,&rdquo; he growled, his face contorted with resentment. &ldquo;I only came to this village to look for supporters. Talking to you was a mistake.&rdquo;\n\nAhri froze, not daring the placate his anger with her charm. The vision from his soul had been too terrible, too inhumane.\n\n&ldquo;I―&rdquo; She shuddered under his red scowl, her nine tails flaring defensively. &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t mean to&hellip;&rdquo;\n\n&ldquo;_Get out!_&rdquo; he shouted. The shadows around him stirred, feeding on his anger. &ldquo;I have no qualms with sorcerers. How you practice your magic doesn&rsquo;t concern me. Go before I kill you.&rdquo;\n\nShe opened her mouth to retort back angrily but stopped. At night, when the shadows were darkest; she was the prey and he was the predator. \n\nShe hissed at him in a way a fox would at a larger creature, then turned and darted into the trees away from his red, seething eyes.\n---\n\n✣ _**Dawn**_ ✣\n\nAhri left her life as a fox behind to become a human - but she wasn&rsquo;t quite there yet. \n\nZed _chose _ to lose his humanity. He _chose _ to kill out of anger and vengeance, not just for survival. He _chose _ to give himself up to the shadows. Revenge was part of human nature too, she thought regretfully.\n\nShe _wanted_ to be a human. He, on the other hand, had given up being one a long time ago.\n \n_The Nine-Tailed Fox and the Master of Shadows._\n\nAhri replayed those names again and again, pondering their unlikeness. \n\nTheir paths were different―the distance that separated them immeasurable. Like the vast space between the north and the south or the infinite reach that divided the sun and the moon.\n\nThey were never meant to meet.\n\n----\n---\n---\n_**Word count**: Approx. 1.3k._\n**A/N:** Ahri&#039;s passive &#039;steals&#039; essence. The dictionary says that &#039;essence&#039; is what makes up an object&#039;s character or intrinsic nature - so essentially memories and experiences. This is the result of my thoughts. :)","replies":[{"poster":"Fyooosh","date":"2016-07-15T15:32:47.425+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Great read! I like your take on what 'essence' is, it's quite intuitive and works really well in this context. \n\nAwesome insight into the characters as well, and the contrasting stances on their humanity. Kind of poses a deeper question about what exactly that entails, what it takes to be human - as well as what it takes away. But all captured neatly in less than 1500 words.","replies":[]}]}
