When you transfer you will be prompted to select a new summoner name on the new server, and the same applies when you return, so while it is possible it will still be available, it is not guaranteed. What you can do though, is create a second OCE account to snag the summoner name as soon as you transfer, but it would mean paying on that new account to change the name off again when you come back so you could put it back on your main.","replies":[]}]}
