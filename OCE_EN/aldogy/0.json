Why is it that when you begin to lose more and drop your MMR you will get shitter teams and lose more LP then you would win? Why gain 16 LP with low MMR and lose 22 LP? how is someone meant to climb by gaining 30 LP two wins and losing 3/4 from just 1 loss. I know that when you get lower MMR you get less LP because you should be in that tier but how will getting less LP help us climb?","replies":[{"poster":"BarryButcher","date":"2016-06-10T10:01:18.226+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I dont think you understand the concepts you are using.\n\nLow MMR means the system believes your current rank is too hard for you (since you have more losses than wins) and is trying to make you drop lower in order to get you to your \"real\" skill level.\nSo when you are losing MMR, being put with \"shitter\" people, they are YOUR level. If you think they are shit then... 8)\nIf you are better than them it will show in your winrate, since although granted some games are \"uncarriable\" they usually even out and you can maintain a good winrate if you are good enough.\n\nThe System is trying to put you at a rank where you have a 50% win rate. It doesn't take into account only your last 5 games or only your last 10 it takes into account the WHOLE season.\nLike you said, you get lower LP because the system doesnt want you to climb, it saying \"this is where you belong, prove me wrong by winning a lot\"\n\nYou actually are in pretty good shape. You only have 5 more losses than wins. If you can manage to get that to even, your MMR will start to rise again with more wins making it easier to climb. All you need to do is get a 55-60% win rate and you climb pretty fast.\n\nhttp://oce.op.gg/summoner/userName=Aldogy","replies":[{"poster":"Aldogy","date":"2016-06-11T00:25:15.965+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thank you for that","replies":[]}]}]}
