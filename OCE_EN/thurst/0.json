Now people troll for a variety of reasons, unfortunately it has a very negative impact on the other 4 players in champion select. Usually one of the 4 a forced to dodge queue resulting in \"leaver buster\" or time delay for next game. In some way, one person is forced into a crappy position because somebody is trolling. I'm not sure what, but something needs to be implemented to stop this behaviour, whether its a reporting function outside of \"end game screen\" or everyone is given 1 queue dodge per week of which no penalty is suffered.\r\n\r\nI feel if you were to poll the community on the matter, you would get an out pour of responses supporting this or something similar. I write to you like this because I know someone in Riot will actually read it. Thank you very much for your time, have a fantastic day.\r\n\r\nThurst","replies":[{"poster":"Sacharissa","date":"2015-02-11T06:02:42.206+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Typing, \"I just lv30, me noob, please no mad\" in champion select. Is that consider trolling?\nIs picking twitch telling your team you will jungle is considered trolling?\n\nYou need to understand that trolling is not an offensive and is not subjected for punishment. {{champion:48}}","replies":[]},{"poster":"DrMattie","date":"2015-02-10T09:09:16.150+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"The thing about this is, people that go \"Troll\" roles are not always considered trolling because you cannot report someone for playing someone out of the Meta Game. Sometimes things work well. However I do agree some people are out to troll/ feed, but every now and then there are people just playing \"Non-Meta\" Champs in Non Meta roles.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Lord Obyssion","date":"2015-02-07T08:35:30.608+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I just made a post about this and a few others have as well. Clearly it's a big problem at the moment. Don't punish good players for trolls!","replies":[]},{"poster":"Schakle","date":"2015-02-17T01:29:22.753+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"What we really need is an actual tribunal system and a champ select report feature. So that if someone is being a %%%% in champ select only so that the Tribunal can't read their %%%%. Then they'll be an angel all game to avoid a ban. I've seen it happen when I played in NA. But if you could report for a toxic champ select and judge someone on that (with much smaller punishments/point aquired for a much smaller part of the game) then there are actual cosequences for going crazy off the bat.","replies":[]}]}
