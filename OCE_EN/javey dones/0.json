I thought I wasn&#039;t being at all toxic, just simply asking for a gank, however, it seems that Rito would much rather side with someone that was, A. Boosting in their games and B. Bragging about how much they get paid and how they will never get banned etc. I think it is absolutely appalling that a player can be banned like this because of a majority vote of other toxic players that gang up on solo players. Too many times have I done well in a game only to be reported for &#039;harassment&#039; despite doing nothing other than asking for a gank or even just doing better than another player. Down below is a part of the text, I can add more but aye, at least now I have a reason to give up on this toxic mess for good. All that money down the drain because of another players actions. Absolute horse dung.","replies":[{"poster":"LAKIGR","date":"2018-06-23T10:35:25.062+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":1,"body":"Ok let’s make this super clear. YOU CANT BE BANNED JUST BECAUSE SOMEONE REPORTED YOU. That’s not how the fucking system works. You can can get 1000 reports and if you’ve done nothing wrong your account won’t be touched. \n\nOn top of that an account is rarely permabanned from the get go so you’ve probably already had a couple of bans to begin with any way.\n\nAnd finally post your full chats logs","replies":[]},{"poster":"Project Xayah","date":"2018-06-23T12:32:21.020+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":2,"body":"Even just looking at the few lines of chat visible in the screenshot you provided, it would appear that you had already started to use chat passive-aggressively after only a few lines. Considering that, I doubt there *isn't* something in the remainder of those logs that would prove the punishment valid, but if you disagree you can feel free to post the *full, unedited* logs and they can be further debated (no one with a brain will simply take your word for it).\n\nIt's important to note that reports, in and of themselves, are *never* taken as enough reason for punishment, even in high quantities. It's also important to note that multiple reports from the same pre-made group are typically weighted as being less than the same number of reports from players who were matched normally, so the idea of pre-made groups \"abusing\" the report system to trigger punishments is, quite frankly, ridiculous (and that's not even considering that only 1 report is actually needed to trigger a review).\n\nYou do, of course, have the option of appealing the ban via [Support](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/requests/new), but that will only help you if the punishment was truly made in error (a decision which is up to the discretion of the support staff, mind you, who are experts on this kind of thing, and undoubtedly more familiar with the agreements, policies and rules that Riot has surrounding such behaviour).","replies":[]}]}
