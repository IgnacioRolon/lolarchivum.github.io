It might work in lower elo, but higher level Nasus players need to be very careful to freeze lane in a good spot for the longest time possible, the AOE from Iceborn Gauntlet ruins this. \n\nThe slow from Iceborn Gauntlet isn't really either relevant because by the time you're actually strong enough to use it, your Wither has something like 1 - 2 seconds downtime between casts. If you get really fed as Nasus though, Iceborn would be a great pick up honestly, just make sure to not get ganked when pushed.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Boosted Ape","date":"2015-12-04T13:55:47.587+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Your post was pretty useful i'm somewhat leaning to Iceborn because nearly all games my Spirit Visage + Merc treads are enough mr and i have also found  aslong as i can decently stack my q i really don't need that much damage","replies":[]},{"poster":"GigaPube","date":"2015-12-04T13:43:59.988+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"personally id just get the sheen since its sooo much more valuable on him now, then build 2-3 items fully before completing either item. pretty much now triforce is so you can handle yourself and iceborn is for being tankier\n\ntheres going to be a better item to buy for the match you play. you should consider numerous factors before deciding what to get. the biggest breakdown is iceborn gauntlet for more armour and tankiness and better stacking earlier on, and triforce for really handling your own towards mid-late game before being able to 1v2/3/4/5\n\nmore things to consider is the extra cdr of the completed and cheaper gauntlet versus the more expensive with lesser cdr triforce. besides the combat stats triforce has the 5% MS and the rage passive which can also be considered a form of safety over the armour of the gauntlet. the gauntlet though gives you an AOE slow, more mana and more armour, for much less gold. its up to you to determine whats best for each game\n\nif you think you're getting pretty damn good at nasus, like oce-plat/diamond level, you could probably always get a triforce as a better item if you dont fall behind and you stack fairly well (300 in 15 minutes is hard to aim for but you'll know you're ready to fight if you can reach it by that time)","replies":[]}]}
