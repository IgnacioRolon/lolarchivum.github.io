I checked later to realise that there was a scheduled maintenance and I decided to come back an hour later. At around 8am I logged on again, only to see the loading screen telling me to reconnect to the game. However, the game is just simply non-existent. I checked my character on op.gg and I am not in a game at all, even though other people in my friends list told me I was. The problem is still persisting and I would like to exit this game that I am not even in. Any ideas on how to resolve this issue?","replies":[{"poster":"Lonely Tree","date":"2016-12-13T22:49:01.956+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"wake up and fix the problem plz riot .... what the hell is this slowest situation solve ability","replies":[]},{"poster":"MurderEmperor","date":"2016-12-13T22:46:43.559+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"same here nothing seems to be working","replies":[]},{"poster":"420 flame it","date":"2016-12-13T22:10:46.503+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"me too","replies":[{"poster":"420 flame it","date":"2016-12-13T22:13:00.704+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"i submitted to ticket to riot ill see what they say","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Jungles Finest","date":"2016-12-13T22:11:28.609+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"same","replies":[]},{"poster":"lovely boy","date":"2016-12-13T22:04:39.438+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Well I tried repairing the client and it had no effect.
