It seems like when problems pop up that really irritate the community Riot takes too long to act. This post is about the crashing of the game Launcher AND Client. Not to mention the disconnect in the Loading Screen of games and all the steps you try to make people take. RIOT needs to make it their attention to fix the bugs in the basic coding of the game that stops the launching and playing of the very game they patch every week. \r\n\r\nIf your game starts up to the launcher page and if you click &quot;Launch&quot; and the League of Legends Logo appears but then disappears WITHOUT the game launching it is not YOUR computer. All you have to do is re-download League of Legends and Run the game as Administrator. Note: This will still bring the same problem. AFTER you click launch you want to create a shortcut from \r\n      Computer -&gt; OS (C:) -&gt; Riot Games -&gt; League of Legends -&gt; RADS -&gt; projects -&gt; lol_game_client -&gt; releases -&gt; 0.0.1.24 -&gt; deploy\r\n \r\nPut the shortcut onto your desktop and rename it to whatever you wish. After you click the LAUNCHER button you MUST click the shortcut icon and the game will then start on the client page (the login page). Note: You must redo this process every Tuesday after the next patch due to the fact that it changes the release of the game AKA the 0.0.1.24 part. Riot ACTUALLY made a link that explains what to do if your game crashes in loading screen and it is helpful and close to this same process. Hopefully this helps some people with Client related loading issues.","replies":[{"poster":"HORSE OF FORCE","date":"2015-03-28T02:17:50.598+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yeah, but unfortunately that only works for when running in admin mode or not is actually the problem, which most of the time it isn't.\n\nThis is still useful information, but not the end-all solution.\n\nShame that Riot don't just make the default shortcut to the admin mode one.","replies":[]}]}
