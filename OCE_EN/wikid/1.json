Just watch youtube or go on tumblr during the whole process. \n\nOn the topic of locking in bans/picks, Riot has implemented a pop-up that explicitly states that you need to lock them in or it will count as a dodge and you will suffer the penalty.

I haven't seen that happen ever.

Elo management in lower tiers is important and keeping a positive win rate is vital. To get out or bronzes, dodging unnecessary loses is the first step in strategy.","replies":[]}]}
