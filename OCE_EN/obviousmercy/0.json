Now I didn&#039;t talk and the outcome was a massive win. Mid game my team started to abuse the crap out of each other but I didn&#039;t join in, I just watched and laughed my arse off, but thats not the point, they asked the enemy team to report all of his team including ME, now you can see the chat logs and you will see that I&#039;m in the right, after the game, I got reported for Verbal Abuse, Harassment:Offensive Language,\r\nNow right here is STUPID, I didn&#039;t say more than 5 messages in that game and now I have another bad report on my name, seriously Riot.","replies":[{"poster":"Wuks","date":"2015-12-11T13:15:08.087+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey ObviousMercy,\n\nBad reports are reviewed and if they have no basis, they're not used towards punishing a player. If a player falsely reported you, I assure you that you have nothing to worry about.","replies":[]}]}
