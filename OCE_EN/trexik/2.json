It was awesome when it first released and all, smooth visuals nice feel to it but now it&#039;s just plain annoying and i want it gone the fact that it takes 20mins to find a game and then you have idiots who cant play anymore than one champion so once their favorite champion is banned or picked they just simply leave and reset its annoying !!!!! RIOT EITHER FIX IT SO THEY HAVE A LONGER QUEUE PENALTY OR GET RID OF IT ENTIRELY !!!! I HATE HAVING TO QUEUE UP 12 TIMES JUST TO GET ONE STUPID GAME!","replies":[{"poster":"sad little benju","date":"2016-02-03T05:24:53.055+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Lol I queued for 70min this morning.
