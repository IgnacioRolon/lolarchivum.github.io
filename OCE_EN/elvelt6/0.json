They are a yordle from Bandle City that has the power to create great illusions of others some that are so powerful that they can take on almost the exact properties of those that she copy and is able to unleash their ultimate abilities over their own team mates. they are a female with a red colour scheme with an old cape with a hood covering most of her face and a medallion made of a magical substance that is the source of her powers.\n(and oh yeah there is allot of things to read so if you don&#039;t like reading you should probably leave :3)\n\nI am thinking about scarlet being a mix between AD and AP and you could be able to build either on her and still be able to carry play well in most games.\n\nStatistics:\nHP - 497-1871 (80.8 per lv)\nHP Regeneration - 1.7 - 8.3 (0.39 per lv)\nMana - 293-1636 (79 mana per lv)\nRanged - 500\nAD - 50 - 97 (2.76 per lv)\nAttack Speed - 0.625 (+0% – 39.1%)\nArmor - 19.3-80.84 (3.62 per lv)\nMagic Resist - 30\nMovement Speed - 335\n\nFriends - {{champion:45}} \nRivals - {{champion:17}} \n\nIll start with what I feel is the most creative part of my champions kit their ultimate:\nR- Mirror Move\nLike Kindred&#039;s passive with the marking you would have the same menu above your health bar with all enemy champions icons on it. when you select a champion on your menu your ultimate becomes a slightly toned down version of theirs. for example if you where to mark Karthus it would only do 3/4 of the original damage but would still have the same AP scaling. Same as if you mark a Jinx and then ult your rocket would only deal 3/4 of what Jinx&#039;s ult would do but would still keep the exact same AD scaling. the mark will be removed from the champion that you had done it on after you used their ultimate. you would not be able to mark that champion again until you have used a different champions ultimate. every time you mark a champion you would not be able to mark a different champion for 60 seconds. The ultimate would also have the same cool-down as the champions that you marked. (Jinx ult has a 90 second cool-down so your ult would have the same if you had used her ultimate and no amount of CDR can change this) this will not be able to copy their ultimate&#039;s passive such as {{champion:82}}  being able to control a dragon through his ultimate as that would be way to overpowered.\n\nE - Seeing Double - Cooldown 15/12/11/10/9.5 Base Damage 80/90/100/110/120 Physical Damage\nA skill shot that scales with Scarlet&#039;s 60% AP and 65% of her AD that throws an illusion of her towards an enemy if it makes contact with them they will have the same effect as a graves W (or nocturne ult) and will not be able to see within a reduced radius for 2 seconds. \n\nW - Pool of vision - Cooldown 40 seconds Base Heal - 30/50/70/90/110 Heal per second\nScarlet turns into a reflective liquid on the ground and will heal depending on her level as well as 40% of her AP and cannot be targeted for 3 seconds any knock ups (such as Zac&#039;s E and Malphites R will instantly remove scarlet form this state). Scarlet will not be able to move throughout the duration of the ability allowing your team (or the enemy) to set up for a gank.\n\nQ - Mirror shard - Cooldown 9/8/7/6/5 Base Damage 70/90/110/130/150 Magic Damage\nA long ranged skill shot that shoots mirror shards at your opponent and deals 50% of your AD and 60% of your AP\n\nPassive - Mirrored Attacks\nEvery auto attack will place a stack of Scarlet&#039;s passive onto an enemy and for each stack (max 3) you will deal an extra 10 Physical Damager to them.\n\nThanks for reading! post what you think below or if you have a lore for her and a few changes I should make please say :3\n(ps sorry for writing so much)","replies":[{"poster":"ƒamous","date":"2015-10-21T11:22:51.164+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Is her W supposed to act like Vladimirs?
