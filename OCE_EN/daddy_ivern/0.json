To do this you would need a map twice the size and after some time some sort of portal system to allow you to get around some parts of your side of the map faster. Imagine someone carrying hard and getting now only 6 items faster than some others, but 12 items before others even have 6.\n\nOr lock 6 of them so you can't upgrade or earn income over a certain limit until others have got some items. Or just let us have it and see what broken champion builds we can make, to make it better \n\nI say we make a map twice the size and allow all unique items to stack, Garen with speed boots and 11 Warmongers...\n\nEkko with 12 Sheeens, one hit no matter who you play.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Talon12","date":"2015-12-14T07:09:18.711+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"wanna try it lol, though mages would be broken as hell XD ez 1.6k + ap","replies":[]},{"poster":"Daddy Ivern","date":"2015-12-14T05:21:21.555+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"First","replies":[]}]}
