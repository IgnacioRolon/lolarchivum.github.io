As far as I understand it, it comes down to the context. For example, saying things like \"Well, f\\*ck\" or \"F\\*ck me\" when you make a mistake (as I often do) likely wouldn't warrant any kind of punishment, since you're not actually breaking any rules. Whereas things like \"f\\*ck you\" or \"this f\\*cking noob [insert champion name here]\" would likely result in some kind of action being taken by Riot, not so much because of the usage of the word \"f\\*ck\" but more so because it's directed abuse.","replies":[{"poster":"Buttsubushi","date":"2016-06-01T04:14:31.445+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Some Riot employees f#cked up, and they were just admitting \"Yeah, we f#cked up\" and there isn't more suitable words to use to describe as such.
