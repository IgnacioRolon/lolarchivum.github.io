I recently played an ARAM game, I got disconnected due to high ping (1000+ -_-) and then i got a leaverbuster warning.\r\n\r\nI did not leave the game intentionally, for almost a day now my ping has been skyrocketing to 500+ in practically almost every game i have played today, therefore, the leaverbuster punishment should not be necessary.\r\n\r\nif someone could give me a link to a debugger or network tracer/log so i can submit it to riot, that would be much appreciate it.","replies":[{"poster":"NZcebos","date":"2015-07-27T09:58:38.011+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"From new zealand am having the same trouble for last day or two","replies":[]}]}
