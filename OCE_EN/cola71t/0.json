After a couple of games champions get pretty boring, the only reason I&#039;ve been able to stick to Tryndamere for a little is because I&#039;ve been playing him in ranked. I find someone interesting, spend all my IP on them, then play them for a few games and have to grind boring champs for enough IP again.\r\n\r\nWhat champions do you consider the most fun, and why? Maybe you&#039;ll pique my interest.","replies":[{"poster":"Lord Sesshomaru","date":"2018-04-07T23:19:14.267+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You could be finding champs boring because your playing ones like Tryndamere..\n\nI find more complex champs hold my interest.\nEveryone who has ever read one of my posts knows that I'm in love with Azir, Aurelion Sol, and Taliyah _(with Swain now close behind)_\n\nThe thing about those 3 champs is:\n\n**1. They're relatively difficult.**  Difficult champs become boring far less quickly because you spend a MUCH longer time actually learning how to play them _(It took me a better part of 20 games just to stop feeding as Azir when he first came out.)_. Even once you learn them, they still keep you on your toes, its a constant battle trying to keep on top of them, making sure you don't get rusty _(if you get rusty on Trynd, you play 1 game and you're back in the swing again, get rusty on Azir... well... good luck.)_. So when youre playing these champs, you'll put in double the effort, and your performance will still be less than it was with Trynd. So not only is it a battle trying to play the champ properly, but it also forces you to be a better player just to keep at the same level you were at before. So thats a lot to think about and focus on, and its hard to get bored with that much on your plate.\n\n**2. They're interesting.** Azir's kit just has so much in it, from creating terrain, to summoning towers, to auto-attacking abilities, dashes, shields, slows, knockbacks. Hell his soldiers even dance when he dances, his kit has a lot to keep you entertained. While Aurelion Sol's kit is simpler, it is unique enough to be very interesting, and with over 30 mins of continuous voice over his game-long sarcasm and sass is always entertaining! Taliyah's play style involves playing around the worked ground, strategising about where and when you put it down, her kit requires a lot of prediction: Predicting her W timing, placing her E where it will do the most damage, predicting their movement when following with your Q, predicting the enemies speed when you Ult. That is something that always keeps you on your toes.\n\n**3. They have personality.** This is highly important for me personally. Champs like Jhin, Jinx, Aurelion Sol, Yorick, Ivern etc. have such amazing voice interactions, it just makes playing them so so SO much more enjoyable. From Sol's sass to Ivern's loopy logic, its something that keeps you enthused even during the boring parts of the game, like walking to lane, or wandering the jungle etc. When your champ is Trynd and only has like 10 lines, and those 10 lines are just \"Blood!\" \"Kill\" \"Im stronger than u\" it gets very tedious.\n\nSo if you're looking for a champ to keep you interested, try finding some with those 3 criteria: **Difficulty**, **Interesting kit** _(there is a difference, you can be hard and have a boring kit, like Lissandra, or Sona)_, and **personality**.\n\n\n_________________________________\n\nObviously I can highly recommend Azir/Sol/Taliyah, but those champs _(especially Sol)_ don't always appeal to everyone. So some others you might be interested in are:\n\n**Yasuo**\n _(as much as I despise him and everyone who has anything to do with him, he's actually a really cool champ thematically.)_, he isn't hard to play, so unlike Azir you don't go through the brutal learning curve, but once you can play him, learning to master him is not as easy as it looks. His kit just revolves around the standard 'AA-crit' gameplay, but dashing everywhere and throwing windwalls and tornados out, makes his kit much more interesting than the rest of his AA-crit buddies like Yi or Trynd. His personality is pretty unimaginative, but the lone swordsman on a path of vengeance and redemption is always a classic, and never really gets old.\n\n**Kayn**\nHe isn't really that difficult, but his double personality and internal convos with Rhaast, alongside his kit that has EVERYTHING, more than make up for it.\n\n**Ivern**\nIf you like winning, maybe don't pick Ivern, but if you want to have a great time, he's definitely the champ for you! His difficulty comes, not from the complexity of his kit, but from the fact that he is outclassed by other junglers in pretty much everything: Damage/durability/gank potential etc. Hit kit is unique, summoning Daisy and bushes, but his main appeal comes from his wacky personality which has you in stitches even in a losing game.\n\n**Evelynn**\nI haven't played much of new Eve so I cant speak for her difficulty, but invisibly stalking the jungle makes her playstyle very interesting, and as for her personality.... lets just say, most guys _(and some girls too of course)_ very much appreciate it.\n\n**Bard**\nBard looks simple, but playing him well is no mean feat. His kit has a lot in it for those who know how to use it. What really makes Bard interesting is that you can adapt his build path HUGELY, you can go full heal bot support with Ardent and Redemption, and all those 'be around me to live' items. Or you can build full hybrid attack speed, with rageblade nashors etc, and delete everyone. He's just so versatile. Despite having no voice lines, he does still have more personality than your typical Darius/Garen etc.\n\n**Gangplank**\nNot the easiest to play, not the hardest either, but highly rewarding. His barrels accompanied by his ult upgrade choices, make his kit pretty fun and interesting to play, while still retaining the power of a crit champ. And his personality... well.. he's a pirate... do you need more than that?","replies":[{"poster":"kaboomblah","date":"2018-04-08T05:44:36.864+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I need to learn Azir.\n\nRunes and laning phase details, please?","replies":[{"poster":"Lord Sesshomaru","date":"2018-04-09T00:33:15.458+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"#Runes\n\nFor runes I take the precision tree.\n\nKeystone: Lethal Tempo\n\nTier 1: Presence of mind\nTier 2: Alacrity \nTier 3: Cut down\n\nDomination Tree\n\nTier 1: Ravenous hunter\nTier 2: Taste of Blood\n\nThats obviously my personal preference, Azir is one of the few mages who can shred tanks, so I like to focus my playstyle on his sustained damage output, hence favouring attack speed and anti-tank runes. The healing from Domination is a personal touch (I like a bit of sustain) and that too helps when fending off tanks. \n\nIf you want him to be bustier, then perhaps take Electrocute as a keystone, and sorcery as a secondary tree, it'll help you more in lane. if you go the bursty path, focus more on flat AP stats rather than anti-tank stuff.\n\n____________________\n\n#In lane\n\nIn lane, Azir is definitely not as much of a lane bully as he used to be, his recently shortened range now puts him in the danger zone of most champs while he is poking or harassing.\nSo I like to keep my harass to short sweet bursts, with the combo [W, AA, Q, AA], place a soldier with W, attack them once, while your AA is on cool down, use your Q to slow them and position your soldier behind them, so when they try to leave, you can attack again on their way out.\n\nIt's tempting to AA more than once after you have Q'd, and if you think you can get away with it, go for it! But the more time you spend attacking, the more at risk you become of copping some of their damage. Mid lane is all about exchanges. Getting a little damage off on them and taking none yourself, is far better than getting a huge chunk of damage off, but also being hit a lot yourself.\nand unlike other mages, Azir has to mostly remain still when poking, so he open himself up to retaliation more than most, which is why in lane, I like to keep things short and sweet, so I'm back in the safe zone, by the time they realise they they're being harassed.\n\nAzir is a late game hyper carry, so the best thing for you to do in lane is just farm up rather than worrying about early kills. Use your harass to show your dominance and punish them when they try to farm, but DON'T look for opportunities to engage. If it comes to a skirmish, you will win drawn out fights, but most mid laners will have dropped their combos and be long gone by the time you've set up all 3 soldiers. So it's generally best to avoid those little skirmishes, and only go ham when you think the fight will last long enough to give you the advantage.\n\nYou're far better off ignoring kills for the most part and just use your harass to make them afraid of farming, while you gobble up all the CS.\n\nBecause of his ult, Azir is far better at counter engaging, than engaging. If you are confident that you can take them in a fight, try not to engage yourself, but rather use your frail body as bait, and when they engage, throw them back to your tower and spam soldiers on them while they are panicking to get away.\n\nAs for CSing, your normal auto attacks are far easier to last hit with than the soldiers!\nThey are instant _(and i mean you click, and Azir has already attacked)_, this means you can wait for minions to get really low before last hitting, none of this allowing for animation and travel time shit. Soldiers' attacks are AoE and very easily push the lane unintentionally.\nUse the soldiers for risky CS, or if you are behind and afraid of them engaging on you, the soldiers give you increased range and you can sit comfortably back and CS from long range when your opponent is scary.\n\n______________________\n\n#Tips and tricks\n\nAlways try to keep a solider in storage, just incase you need to make a quick escape from a sneaky jungler, or an engage from your lane opponent.\n\nWhen attacking a tower, if you're confident that you wont be ganked, spam all 3 soldiers behind you _(out of range of the tower)_ which will give you the attack speed boost.\n\nRemember your E has 3 parts, a dash, a shield, and damage.\nWhen to use it, is dependant on which part you need most. In a duel you can save it for a clutch shield like barrier, or you can use it to reposition _(or escape)_ in a fight, or if its a close fight and you really need some extra burst, use it for a little extra damage.\n\nRemember that your E always gives you a shield now, even out of combat. So if you see a Karthus ult coming down, or ignite ticking away on you. Don't forget that your E provides a pretty meaty shield. \n\n_______________________\n\n#Spells\n\nAzir is a sustained damage champ, the longer he lives, the more damage he does. So I like to take spells that help him live as long as he can. Its tempting for any mid laner to take ignite. But the main purpose of ignite is to give champs a little extra damage once their combo is done. Azir doesn't need extra damage, he has all he needs. You just need to live long enough to do it.\nSo I take barrier and flash on him, barrier is clutch, and it extends your life enough to pump out a little extra damage.\n\nIf you need any proof, measure how much damage you do between casting barrier, and having the shield destroyed. You'll find that it heavily out damages Ignite at almost all times in the game _(with the exception of early game)_.\n\nGood luck! and have fun with my baby :3\n\n{{sticker:slayer-pantheon-thumbs}}","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Cola71t","date":"2018-04-08T09:41:41.269+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Wow, didn't think I'd get a whole wall of text to myself, thanks for taking the time and effort to reply.\n\nI agree Tryndamere is very dull, but I've been having success with him in ranked, which is the only reason i still play him.\nI often pick a champion that looks interesting when I have little to no IP then forget about them or change my mind once I can afford them, I was interested in Kayn at one point, and I'll have a try at him when i have the IP.\n\nThanks once again, I'll try refer to this whenever I have some spare currency left.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"kaboomblah","date":"2018-04-07T12:05:05.627+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Ahri!
