In the loading screen it goes black, then it says there was a connection error. It&#039;s been happening since yesterday and it&#039;s really annoying. For some reason when the loading screen pops up, when I ult tab it still shows the league of legends logo in the middle of my screen. I don&#039;t know what&#039;s happening but maybe its TPG, however all my other friends can access it fine. Someone please help. I&#039;ve tried restarting. It&#039;s been happening since 4pm yesterday.","replies":[{"poster":"sR4ZE","date":"2015-09-21T04:59:00.871+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I had that exact same problem about 5 days ago, it has gone away now and i am also on TPG internet","replies":[]},{"poster":"Catus Carnival","date":"2015-09-18T08:50:01.918+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"RADs Error \"Could not connect to the HTTP server.\" That one?\n\nI'm on TPG and receiving this when I try to log on.","replies":[]}]}
