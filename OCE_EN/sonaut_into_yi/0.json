I find games between 40 seconds to 3 minutes at this time, meanwhile during the day it can take up to 15 minutes which is ridiculous. In my opinion this is terrible decision with how a lot of people go to lan centres to play and usually stay over night and Duo ranked with a friend or maybe Flex with a bunch of people. I find this quite disgusting especially with how unpopular flex is, now people are forced to play flex during this time. Some others may not care but its agrovating especially those who want to just do a marathon of ranked solo/duo and then having flex which is completely different queue for ranked is forced upon them. \r\n\r\nCouldnt comment on the thread but it is what it is. This needs to be changed because it is just pointless in my opinion.","replies":[{"poster":"The Bum King ","date":"2016-12-27T12:45:56.808+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I agree and when your only free time is when flex is up and solo is down makes me mad tbh","replies":[{"poster":"Jerem√Ω","date":"2017-04-16T18:03:31.717+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"110% know the feels, please riot do something\n\ndoes turning them off for 4 hours really do that much, while flex? this new game mode can stay on all the time? i don't understand that?","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Sonaut Into Yi","date":"2016-12-26T18:30:26.258+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I know some part of it has to do with asian countries such as China playing at that time and dont speak english, but lets be real.. Team-mates rarely communicate properly so trying to keep the speech boundry in ranked solo/duo is just useless. From what I know, the higher the rank, the more cocky players get and never listen to one another","replies":[]}]}
