So my question is it is not a Glitch according to your rule books and game so i don&#039;t think there is any issue with this, hope this is clear until you guys provide some specific information.","replies":[{"poster":"SephirothSG","date":"2017-05-14T07:45:38.387+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey there,\n\nI'm unsure if this is intentional or not, however you may wish to make a thread over on the [report a bug](http://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/bug-report) board about this for clarities sake.\n\nBe sure to read the \"[How to Report a Game Bug](https://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/bug-report/3mQGBEjA-how-to-report-a-game-bug)\" thread before posting.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Flaming Meat","date":"2017-05-14T04:21:17.157+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Tested and can confirm it functions like this. However if you ult again it destroys the last clone.
