Nobody is going to carry you, because it's likely that you wont be able to hold your own in a rank any higher than you are now, negatively impacting games.\n\nMaybe it would be a good idea to seek out people of a similar skill level so you guys can work together and improve together :D\n\nGLHF ♥","replies":[{"poster":"Dark Warrior","date":"2016-12-01T07:24:10.195+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"but but :( why always my team is Unranked 2-3 players in game and enemy is Gold always ?\n\nalso I am new so idk how things works here, people say in game if u ask help in boards they help u T_T\n\nI had 50+ win rate on poppy as my support champ but to many people unranked :( makes me lose 4-5 in a row \n\nWhat I can do I love playing sup then other line lose badly T_T","replies":[{"poster":"Ingénue","date":"2016-12-01T09:12:31.566+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"**The boards can help you, but no-one will carry/boost you. It's more like we give advice on how to improve.**\n\nThe number of potatoes and new players in ranked queue isn't the reason you aren't climbing. Every year hundreds of players make it out of bronze/silver and climb to higher ranks. Some do it alone, others do it as a group. Some get boosted (and then banned). \n\nYou need to approach things differently. You could play flex queue as a 5man until you are confident you have the skills to do well on your own. You could take a break from ranked completely and get your skills up in normals.  \n\nI managed to get from bronze to plat in S6 only by playing support, mainly by playing dynamic queue with people I knew could at least hold their lanes. I also spent a lot of time reviewing resources and my ranked games/stats to see what I could do better (and then act on these). Take a look at the resources I linked and work on getting some mates together for flex (in a less \"boost me pls\" way).","replies":[]}]}]}]}
