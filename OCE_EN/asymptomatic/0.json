As expected the launcher vanishes and I get myself into the typical waiting pattern of 3-5 seconds for the client login to appear. To my dismay, it did not. I tried again, again and again, each to no avail. My theory is that somewhere in the inner workings of this launcher, is an option to launch the now decommissioned legacy client and not the new updated version, however any option to rectify this is not visible to me. I was playing just hours ago and now I am not. halp plz","replies":[{"poster":"sma11 cat","date":"2017-04-05T22:42:46.666+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I am also having this problem.\nHad to do a fresh install, and now clicking launch just closes the launcher.\n\nUpdate: You can launch the new client directly!\nThis is where I found mine - C:\\Riot Games\\League of Legends\\RADS\\projects\\league_client\\releases\\0.0.0.61\\deploy\\LeagueClient.exe\n\nThen when it is launched, it will update your shortcuts to this for you","replies":[]},{"poster":"Formique","date":"2017-03-28T02:16:10.283+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I also am having this problem, The Legacy client is my friend, and i want it back, the new client freezes on 28 seconds in champ select, someone pls help SOS","replies":[]}]}
