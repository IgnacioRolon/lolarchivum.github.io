I purchased them agessss ago using the RP points you start off with. But the moment I hit level 6 I lost them both, they just disappeared. In my stats they said locked and when I started a match I didnt have the option to choose them. Im not sure if I lost any other champs because these are the only 2 I use. \r\n\r\nFix?","replies":[{"poster":"HORSE OF FORCE","date":"2015-04-09T11:39:10.535+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Strange. Are you sure that you were using the one account, and not another?\n\nIf you're 100% sure it was champions being removed from your account, create a [support ticket](https://support.leagueoflegends.com/anonymous_requests/new) and see what they can do to help you restore them. Having purchase proof of the transactions will help you (you can find that in the store, I believe).","replies":[{"poster":"pinkieseb","date":"2015-04-10T08:49:49.740+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Nevermind.
