I don&#039;t even know what I&#039;m complaining about anymore there&#039;s is just too much shit wrong with this system.. the remake function should be to stop this from happening. If they aren&#039;t playing the game why should I lose so much lp because RIOT&#039;s system is broken. I don&#039;t understand for the life of me how this is fair? I understand everybody&#039;s intention is not to instantly go into a game and have to remake but when the client itself has a major problem why should the players suffer? has this happened to anybody else? went from nearly gold to nearly bronze in about a week, now I finally start climbing again and this happens.. feels real bad \r\n\r\n{{sticker:sg-soraka}}","replies":[]}
