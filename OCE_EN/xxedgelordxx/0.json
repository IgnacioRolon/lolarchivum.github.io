Now, I&#039;m not normally a toxic player, I do my best and mute all at the beginning of every game, I only say things like, &quot;nice&quot;, &quot;gj&quot;, &quot;well done&quot;, and use pings to encourage or discourage plays. Most people I think should behave something like this you would think. But after this drop from feeling so close to getting gold before season end, but having it thrown in my face by feeders and trolls really got to me. However, I decided to change roles and champions you know fresh start, I win two in a row hey lucky me right, I carry my team with the help of another sane player in both games, I then make it to a third game. I get a Warwick only player in champ select who bans my now 2 from 2 champion for this ranked season, and starts saying &quot;run it, run it down lmao run it down mid what are you b1, b2, b4? I bet you&#039;re b4&quot; and nobody dodges. I have to dodge obviously, and somehow I lose 10lp from saving 4 people from the trouble of a game with someone only intent on ruining everybody else&#039;s experience. What I&#039;m proposing here is when certain keywords come up in champ select, I feel as though a red outline should center on that player, and people should have the option to vote for a veto of the game by clicking on that player, thus imposing the lp loss and dodge timer upon them.\r\n\r\nTLDR; I feel like as a group there should be a way of deciding who should &#039;get&#039; the dodge. Thoughts? I know it isn&#039;t perfect but it&#039;s better than the reasonable few suffering.","replies":[{"poster":"Roguestoney","date":"2018-05-24T23:06:49.924+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Because if the 4th person to pick on a team is hovering a contested champ pick and no one is willing to pick for them early on, you bet your ass i would ban that champ rather than leave it open fo the other team.","replies":[]}]}
