I said stfu nerd in chat a few times because a group of people decided to start some nonsense in an aram, and they report me at the end of the game as a group and now I'm chat restriced? sure I could have just muted and kept playing, but it's aram, sometimes banter is half the fun. This however was not banter, and I was basically being bullied or whatever you'd like to call it. So the number of reports regardless of who is obviously backing each other is what it comes down to? Nobody actually reads anything when they issue bans they just rely on some basic AI to weed out who said what thing * number of reports? This is kinda dumb.  I'm at no real loss not being able to talk in a game because I usually say nothing besides gj or bad luck but I think this is a shitty system considering I had honour 5 nearly all season and some idiots start being rude so I defend myself and now get punished. Maybe this makes no sense, or maybe the league community is just as awful as I always thought it was..","replies":[]}
