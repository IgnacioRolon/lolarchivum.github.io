Any other suggestions for champs to buy would be good also.\r\nCheers","replies":[{"poster":"McRuthless","date":"2015-08-25T21:57:21.876+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Considering you've just hit 30 I'd strongly suggest renekton. Champions that are fairly simple to play allow you to devote more of your focus to improving general things like last hitting, map awareness, decision making etc. which will not only improve your gameplay by a lot but remain useful if you decide to pick up a new champion or role. A champion as versatile as thresh might seem appealing but realistically you won't be able to play him to anywhere near his maximum potential for a very long time (and he's also more reliant than most on teammates since he has almost no damage and one of his best peeling tools, his lantern, requires your teammate to actually click it, which you shouldn't expect to happen all the time in lower ranks). The way I see it, a mediocre champion played at like 80% of their potential is usually stronger than a good champion played at 50% of their potential.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Talon12","date":"2015-08-24T23:55:55.637+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"tahm stronk\n\nrene if you want a solid lane which you can play with relative surety of not feeding\nthresh needs decent mechanics to work, and a decent team to work with, if the rest of the team goes bad it will all go bad for thresh as well\n\nalso if you can LEARN yasuo (no he isn't easy and always wins, he actually loses most games because people think that then they feed) you can carry easily, but he requires dedication to get good, if your not good you feed, but if you're good you trash the enemy so hard.","replies":[{"poster":"Unforgiiven","date":"2015-08-25T07:08:49.443+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"yeah haha i have mastery with yas too scared to play him in ranked tho because of that reason :0","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"ninjaIRL ","date":"2015-08-24T18:42:03.825+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"If you have no other decent support champions that you know then pick Thresh.\n\nRenekton, as you said, has strong early game bullying however you run the risk of being useless during teamfights upon matching with players who avoid you all the time. You should be initially fine however, most new players don't expect slice/dice range therefore you can follow up with your other abilities.\n\nAlso his empowered Q heals for A LOT when you hit enemy champions with it.\n\nMost lanes he will do fine with because all you need to do is build tanky and not die whilst pressuring them with damage.\n____\nIf you're looking for a really sturdy, tanky, in-your-face support then pick Braum. He becomes really hard to kill once you get {{item:3401}} with {{item:3143}}, {{item:2049}}, {{item:3102}}.\nHe is really disruptive as well as you can stun a couple of targets my proccing his passive on multiple targets, your team can follow up with basic attacks to stun them.\nHis Q has a really heavy slow once you max it rank 5.\nYou can run around ward the whole map with {{item:1329}}.\n\nYou can destroy/block the projectiles of Caitlyn, Ezreal and Draven ultimates with your E shield.\nReally fun support.

Since he dives into the team first and isn't a full tank like Leona or Ali who also dive in.\nHonestly when i started playing League Thresh was my favourite champion for like 3 months. So much fun when you first buy him. (though in ranked i'm like 1 win and 8 losses with him)\n\nRenekton is kinda meh atm. I mean, he's a lane bully and can win lane but he doesn't win every lane. And a Renekton who doesn't win lane can quickly become useless. Harder for newer people to make work imo since you need to have a certain SUPER AGGRESSIVE yet calculated playstyle to make him work well.\n\nIf you want a strong, early game champion for top lane i'd suggest looking at Gangplank or Fiora. Maybe even Hecarim or Gnar.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Jolyne Cujoh","date":"2015-08-24T12:12:29.171+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thresh is an amazing supp champ and once you wrap your head around him he becomes incredibly easy to learn and master. Renekton can be a little hard due to bad match ups and can be very unforgiving of mistakes, but at the same time is great top. If you need someone to play as a supp and dont need a tanky damage dealer for top, go for thresh. Good luck in your ranked matches","replies":[]}]}
