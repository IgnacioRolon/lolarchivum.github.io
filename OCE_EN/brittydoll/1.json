(Did a few 60 page artbooks of pics a while ago though since this).\n\nThis was the first time I really drew on computer and it really annoyed me and I got frustrated at not having physical control over it. I've spent so long looking at things on deviantart and always look for new wallpapers (like every week) and I don't like drawing on my computer but feel like using physical tools isn't good enough from all the awesome photoshopped art I've seen :P.\n\n(I drew a rough pencil pic then scanned it and then started painting over it with mspaint lol I have no idea wut im doen).\n\nI'd draw like Riven/Ahri/Akali/Rek'Sai/Ekko if I could and maybe in a battle pose for Akali and maybe Ekko dashing through time and Rek'Sai about to burrow into the ground and Riven posing or Ahri in an aggressive pose. Shyvana would be awesome too but it wouldn't be obvious that it wasn't just another Dragon hahahaha maybe a few Champs in the same pic would make it obvious.\n\nI can envision things but its really hard to get it out on paper. Maybe I should draw some more. Zombie Brand would be sweet though. Maybe you should have some minions nearby fleeing for their lives with plumes of Green fire chasing after them (Hardest possible picture in the world to draw though). :p","replies":[{"poster":"BrittyDoll","date":"2015-11-28T06:11:26.418+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"you have so many great ideas.... and ou dont have to be good at drawing on a computer..... but i still think your image is fantasic..... a lot of artist i love on youtube are better at paper drawings but i still think there amazing it really just depends what you want to draw with :D \n\nas for brand idk XD ll work something out","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Combilizer","date":"2015-11-28T08:10:11.650+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey!

Wish I could draw like that. I used to be able to draw but then my drawings turned dark and messy and I do some ok drawing sometimes but most of it's like random artisticy stylized things and if I set out to draw something specific I fail miserably because I stopped doing it and fell out of practice :p.","replies":[{"poster":"BrittyDoll","date":"2015-11-28T03:56:40.840+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thank you :D.  ah wow nah i draw a lot just barely post most things im trying to get one drawing vid up a week think ill doo zombi brand next. you should draw again :D i bet they look amazing.","replies":[]}]}]}
