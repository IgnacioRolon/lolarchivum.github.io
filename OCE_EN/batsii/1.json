As a new starting off streamer it is hard to get my name out there and im looking to the Oce Community to help me out.\r\n\r\nMy stream is set in High Quality for your enjoyment. I am a platinum top laner who plays seriously but also has fun to keep you entertained. i answer questions, do straw polls on champs and explain my train of thoughts on my lane and issues that arise with it. My role as a new streamer is to keep you entertained while I play but at the same time educate you my lane match ups and try to help you guys out to the best of my knowledge\r\n\r\nWhy I recommend watching my stream? Unlike pro streamers I was once in bronze (low elo) so I know what it takes to get out of the low divisions and the mind set it takes and will answer all questions in my twitch chat to help you guys out. Watching a challenger player is entertaining but doesn’t really help you as a single gamer climb elo due to the fact that challenger end of gameplay is so even, where as in low divisions ( Bronze – Platinum) the skill varies from people who are climbing and the people who are falling (feeders vs People who carry). So as I Climb I will give you an understanding of how my gameplay will change depending on the champ I am vising and the division I’m in.\r\n\r\nAs i am new i am trying hard to get my name out to the public and I greatly appreciate all support from the public (You Guys).\r\n\r\nPlease come and check it out of your looking for a new home or to support a new streamer.\r\n\r\nThanks for your time\r\n\r\nBatsii","replies":[{"poster":"Crusader charlie","date":"2015-02-27T02:02:05.808+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"sounds nice, would you also upload some youtube videos or have a voice channel on teamspeak? because you could answer questions through teamspeak or something similar while you play for both yours and our convenience perhaps?\n\nand the youtube videos would be a nice thing just because I might not be able to watch your streams all the time (sadly)\n\nno pressure, just putting it out there","replies":[]},{"poster":"csm","date":"2015-02-27T10:53:10.034+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Plenty of pro players started in low elo.","replies":[{"poster":"Batsii","date":"2015-02-27T14:37:52.416+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yeah, but its easy to forget how to climb when your at the top of the food chain, all you do is have to play the same making very minor tweeks to your gameplay. where as lower elo need to make drasitc changes and then changes to your changes. im not here to argue with you but thats how i feel on that topic.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Batsii","date":"2015-02-27T10:58:00.246+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thanks for some of you who came out today to check it out, your advice on making the stream better and giving good advice on how to make my channel more popular has helped alot, your support to follow the stream is more appreciated than you think","replies":[]},{"poster":"Batsii","date":"2015-02-27T05:01:18.157+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I stream pretty much all day, but yeah sure noted","replies":[]}]}
