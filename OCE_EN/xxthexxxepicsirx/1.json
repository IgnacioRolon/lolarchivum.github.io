The most important thing you can do is arm yourself with information, learn as you go, and be proactive about solving it.\n\nMy advice here would be to start working through with some testing and see how far you get.  It might be your ISP, but there might be things you can do to learn about where the source of the problem is, and ultimately tip the internet-stability gods in your favour!\n\n* Check what type of NBN you have (FTTP / FTTN / HFC etc).  They can suffer all from different issues.\n * If you're on Fibre to the Node (FTTN) - Check for sync speed in your router and make sure it matches the speed you've signed up for in your NBN plan.  If not, call Telstra and let them know (they are [refunding customers](http://www.smh.com.au/business/comment-and-analysis/42000-telstra-nbn-customers-to-get-compensation-rather-than-speed-20171108-gzh6di.html) who don't get what they are paying for)\n* Check if you've reached a data limit and have had your connection shaped/restricted\n\nFor testing, there are a few things to try:\n\n* First up - identify an easy way to replicate the problem.  It could be via a speedtest, by loading into a LoL custom game, using [pingplotter](https://www.pingplotter.com/fix-your-network/getting-started?page=2) - there are many ways.\n* Switch from WiFi to using an Ethernet cable (even just as a test)\n* Remove other network devices so only your PC/Test device is on your internet connection\n* Log in to your router and check if anything looks off - also check and see if you can update its firmware to the latest version\n\nThere are some other tips and tricks on what you can do over at our [Lag Report](https://lagreport.oce.leagueoflegends.com/en/steps) site, which would definitely be worth a look in your case.\n\nCheers\nMindstar","replies":[]},{"poster":"a grub","date":"2017-11-12T03:43:30.442+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"call your isp.
