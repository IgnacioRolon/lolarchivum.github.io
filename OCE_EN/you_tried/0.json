The biggest thing about getting an early lead in Diamond is that players make a LOT less mistakes, which allows you to keep/push a lead a lot harder. Secondly, it allows you to scout for where their jungler is starting. This is important as if he is not starting on the bottom side buff, the enemy bot lane could take a camp and hit 2 to force a lead in bottom lane.\nIn regards to knowing when the enemy is invading, it can come down to a couple of factors such as:\n\n1. Pick Champions - If the enemy has a Blitzcrank, Morgana, Thresh, Nautilus or something of the kind with long range hard CC. They are probably looking to invade.\n2. Team Composition - If one team has a much stronger level 1 for fighting in general (Braum/Jayce/Naut/Lee etc) then they could invade.\n3. Organization - If your team sees the enemy had someone loading slowly or you can assume they may be tabbed out when you get in game, you could easily rush their jungle before they get there as 5. Quite often you can get into deep positions in the jungle or pick up a free kill.\n\nThe lane swap scenario is not overly common in solo queue. I've seen a couple of situations in which its happened but I'd still consider it rare just due to the fact that they are A LOT harder to pull off effectively than they look. If one team slips up even the slightest, it can snowball kills/objectives drastically, or if the team initiating the swap don't get a significant advantage out of it, then it can put individuals (such as the top) even further behind.\n\nHowever there are definitely some good reasons for doing so!\n1. If your top laner is able to double jungle effectively with your jungler, it can give safe and quick clear times while you wait for the wave to shove in bottom.\n2. \"The Vayne Janna vs Kalista Braum\" scenario. Vayne and Janna shouldn't be able to win this very easily early in a 2v2, however they could easily push hard and deny a top laner as they have shields and range. \n3. Your top laner is hard countered in top. If your top is comfortable being able to farm under turret in a 2v1 but is very vulnerable in a 1v1, you can swap them around. If the enemy have a strong early game/snowball top, this will deny them any chance to get ahead and influence the game.\n4. Forcing the early game turret pushing strategy allows faster global gold, and the ability to dive enemies or freeze a carry in a lane when well coordinated. Gold distribution is huge, and the ability to freeze a Vayne in bot and have Rek'Sai's global Ulti ready to gank anyone overextending past first turret at 7 minutes is quitea large impact on the overall state of the game.\n\nHope this helps you to understand a little bit about why people do it!","replies":[]},{"poster":"Nijel","date":"2016-04-15T06:44:40.464+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"One of the funnier reasons Diamond players enter the enemy jungle is on the off chance someone has alt tabbed out of the game while standing in a really accessible spot. Walk in, get first blood and everyone involved starts with a nice advantage. It's worth a go when you have a strong level 1 team that features strong singletarget cc like blitz, thresh or morg. Likewise, if you see the enemy team has these you can assume they will invade too. \n\nThere are two decent ways to stop this. You can either ward the entrances to your jungle so you know where the enemy is or you can stack your whole team in a bush you think the enemy will pass through when invading. The moment someone gets close you can jump them. These more defensive strategies are decent ways to start of any game regardless of rating since they might save you from an unexpected invade.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Main Line","date":"2016-04-14T10:24:35.379+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"These questions can be prefaced by the questions:\n\nWhat is the meta? Why do we have an ADC? Why does the ADC start on the bot side of the map and not the top side? \nIt mainly comes down to superior understanding of gameplay by higher elo players, and also they follow the meta and plays of LCS and pros, etc. Level 1 invades only work when the understanding is on the same level by the players in the team. Most under platinum players simply don't have this level yet.\n\nA 5 man invade is important if a team wants to lane swap. They need information on where the enemy ADC is going to start. So they invade and get wards down to spot them out.\n\nIn soloqueue there are also many types of Level 1 \"Cheesing\" that can happen. A few months back when Riot didn't know about this bug in ranked team play some 5 man stack Diamond teams were being paired against Bronze and Silvers. And one thing that especially Bronze players are very bad at is getting their butts off the fountain. By the time this bronze team had arrived in their usual 1-1-3 formation to start their level 1 jungle clear (*** which by the way is not the most efficient start in the current meta, but happens in soloqueue due to lack of communications and perhaps understanding), they were already 5 man engaged and killed. \n\n> [{quoted}](name=Requiemsfire,realm=OCE,application-id=FjGAIbRv,discussion-id=d6EkEcgr,comment-id=0000,timestamp=2016-04-14T05:28:08.682+0000)\n>\n> The lane switch is a bit difficult to discern without an exact situation but maybe they did the swap because their top laner was a safe farming champion who could hold out a 1v2 while their botlane+support was good at bullying the enemy toplaner and that they felt their botlane was weak without the switch.\n> \n\nI'll agree with this part of the explanation. An ADC may be weak in lane but be a strong late game carry, e.g. a Vayne vs a Kalista. Also one team may have a stronger tower taking ADC, and they want to 4 man smash on opposite sides of the map and win the race. Watch Legacy vs Chiefs game 2 of the series when Swiffer came back, for an example.\nIf you watched Worlds last year, it was interesting to see that some regions had better understanding of the Lane Swap than others. For example the Chinese teams were poor at it, but European teams were very good.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Knuuckles","date":"2016-04-14T05:46:58.572+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Bronze and silver generally don't know how or when to invade successfully and early game set backs aren't the end of the world for that elo coz people throw every 5 minutes","replies":[]},{"poster":"Requiemsfire","date":"2016-04-14T05:28:08.682+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The whole team generally enters the jungle to invade, to either steal a blue buff from a champion dependent on it for its first few clears or to steal as many creeps in a short amount of time as possible from the enemy jungle to slow him/her down especially devourer based champs and maybe even catch the enemy jungler out. They probably know because they've taken precautions such as warding and predict based on whether or not enemies left their lanes.  \n\nThe lane switch is a bit difficult to discern without an exact situation but maybe they did the swap because their top laner was a safe farming champion who could hold out a 1v2 while their botlane+support was good at bullying the enemy toplaner and that they felt their botlane was weak without the switch.\n\nI'm still in bronze II myself and have been playing since december last year but these are my best guesses.
