When I came back they were very mad, one person then went afk and the game then became a bitch fest in /all because they didn't get the remake.\r\n\r\nRemake system is broken if this is how people behave because of it. \r\n\r\nIf you have an afk at the start, don't throw because of it, until the remake passes. Then flash and ult and shit.","replies":[{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2019-07-26T09:03:10.208+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Remake is not a perfect system. It can't be in a game as complex as pretty much any substantially sized multi-player experience. They should be more than aware of this, and whether or not they think the remake will be available that is not an excuse to intentionally feed and then throw the game when they don't get their way. This kind of behaviour is most definitely report worthy.\n\nLike you said, wait until the remake actually passes to mess around.","replies":[]}]}
