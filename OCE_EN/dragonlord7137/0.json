All I want is a status to be view able somewhere in the client about these things before I start a game with friends so I don&#039;t drag them into the low priority queue with me.","replies":[{"poster":"Zorphiax","date":"2016-04-06T22:23:04.934+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"In the top right corner of all the official League of Legends websites next to the notifications is a box with an exclamation mark '!' clicking on that box will allow you to see all notifications from riot directly to you (suspensions, warning, bans etc.)","replies":[]},{"poster":"Talon12","date":"2016-04-06T03:36:14.990+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"chat restriction says in the top right corner of client either after finishing a game, logging in or every hour, low priority also says it in top right corner after games or every hour\n\nand added with top right corner, on log in it gives you a ticket, it also says in your email.","replies":[]}]}
