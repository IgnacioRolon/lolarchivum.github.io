Leaverbuster is a system that works.\r\nLeaverbuster was designed specifically for AFKers.  The downsides to this is the vagueness in explaining, clearly explaining, the system. \r\ni.e.\r\n\r\n> AVOIDING LEAVERBUSTER\r\nWHAT CAN I DO ABOUT MY LEAVER LEVEL?\r\n Make sure you can commit to upwards 40 minutes of uninterrupted play time before joining a match. If you find that you are having many instances of emergencies, disconnections, etc., please resolve these issues as best as you can.\r\n\r\n       How exactly does that answer the question in any way?  That is one of the paragraphs that not so subtly evade the question. It's a system that works, but not one I trust. \r\n\r\nWhat I feel is that there isn't enough player input when it comes to the sentencing. I don't understand why we need a Leaverbuster when we have a tribunal. The tribunal is fair and equal- it's the actual voice of the community. Why should one offense be treated different to others? \r\n\r\nSay Player X was trolling around in a game, not helping the team, and being disruptive. Player X does this frequently in his games and garners many reports- but he isn't automatically placed in a low priority queue though is he? He's judged by the tribunal (if we ever get one >_>). \r\nHis reports by fellow team-mates and maybe enemies (ha-ha) results in his prosecution by the tribunal, which consists of even more players and members of the LoL community. He is judged fairly by the people whose games he has or could have actively disrupted. Justice is done, and everyone gets their way (except Player X, obviously). Everyone's happy. \r\n\r\nLeaverbuster is not quite so mindful of our opinions though. Regardless of circumstance, if Player Y were to leave- even if God forbid it's Riots servers- he's punished. Is he punished because his team-members reported him? Is he reported because he's upset every single person that was matched with? No. He's reported because of a system that is generously dictatorial.\r\n\r\ntl;dr- \r\n* Leaverbuster works.\r\n*There is little to no information about the stupid system. Don't expect help from the Leaverbuster FAQ.\r\n*If theyre so hellbent on keeping their ridiculous pet project, explain it to us better. Give us a chance. Dont just tell us to 'fix our shit'. \r\n\r\n*We need Tribunal back.\r\n*Tribunal works FAR better, it's the community's voice. We get what we want. \r\n\r\n\r\n*Leaverbuster works on a basis that is borderline Hitler. \r\n\r\nP.S. {{champion:44}} new skin where","replies":[{"poster":"BUKKAKE TSUNAMI","date":"2015-03-19T09:57:23.314+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"I got leave buster from fucking intro bots playing with  friend who just stared because I disconnected for about 20 seconds to re-log because my internet is shit wtf Riot","replies":[{"poster":"kJs","date":"2015-03-19T10:44:12.975+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"*rekt*","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Project Xayah","date":"2015-11-18T08:58:40.954+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> I don't understand why we need a Leaverbuster when we have a tribunal.\n\nWell, we don't have a tribunal so it's probably a good thing we have Leavebuster to pick up the slack.\n\n> Why should one offense be treated different to others?\n\nBecause they're different. Let's face it, you wouldn't treat a person shoplifting from a servo the same as a person assaulting another person, because they're different offences.\n\n> but he isn't automatically placed in a low priority queue though is he?\n\nHow would LPQ help a \"troll\" player reform? LPQ is designed so that people **have** to commit time to their games, it's not designed to improve (or eliminate) their in-game behaviour.\n\n> Regardless of circumstance, if Player Y were to leave- even if God forbid it's Riots servers- he's punished.\n\nA few things to point out here. The Leavebuster system accounts for the rare/uncommon unintentional DC, the kind of thing that most players would experience due to ISPs, modems, computers etc. It does not, however, account for **constant/consistent** unintentional DCs, because why should it? Every player has agreed to both the TOU and EULA that states (more or less) \"it is the responsibility of the **player** to ensure their computer/internet service meets the connection requirements of the game\", if you're DCing enough to be hit with LPQs then that simply isn't happening. And in the rare occasions where it is Riot's servers, no one is forcing you to risk DCing before they fix the issue, that's a choice you make of your own accord so don't blame Riot for that. If you start having connection issues, stop playing *at least* until you know what's causing it, that is **your responsibility**, as a player, after all.","replies":[]},{"poster":"BUKKAKE TSUNAMI","date":"2015-11-18T08:46:50.361+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"1.","replies":[]},{"poster":"GoldenTomat0","date":"2015-03-19T02:32:21.831+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":2,"body":"the tribunal didn't work. how do people not get that.
