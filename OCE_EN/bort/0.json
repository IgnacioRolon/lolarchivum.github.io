This is occurred at a crucial time of the game when I believe we were in a position to win. \r\n\r\nThis occurred at ~ 18:10 AEST, we were all disconnected and able to briefly reconnect before being disconnected a second time, during which enemy super minions ended the game.  I was unable to see any post match discussion screen, and the game took up to 10 minutes to appear in my match history.  Please look into this Riot as this is unacceptable and frustrating as you could imagine.\r\n\r\nI feel the losing team deserves a &quot;Loss Forgiven&quot; as we were denied an opportunity to defend and push during a situation which could have led to our victory.\r\n\r\nKind regards,\r\nBort","replies":[{"poster":"HORSE OF FORCE","date":"2015-06-22T07:44:22.115+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":">we were all disconnected and able to briefly reconnect before being disconnected a second time\n\nHow can you know this? Was chat still functioning, and everyone in game have no reason to lie?\n\nAnyway, the servers are poop and Riot won't enable Loss Forgiven for a single game. Neither can they change games that have occurred in the past, because of the mess that is reimbursing LP to all players involved even if they've had more games since then.","replies":[]}]}
