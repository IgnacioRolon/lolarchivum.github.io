I lost the first 2 games and then won the next 3 and instead of being promoted I was put into another series in gold 1 for Plat V.

You can submit a [Support Ticket](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/requests/new) and Player Support may be able to verify for you. Give them the links to your series matches from your match history page.\n\n-DTN","replies":[]}]}
