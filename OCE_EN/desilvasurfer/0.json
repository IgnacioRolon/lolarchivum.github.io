You typically wont need another source of Ranged ADC in a team comp, however you could use Area of effect CC and burst damage along with a zhonyas which can help you to position/initiate most effectively without risk of being burst. Top lane also brings a lot to the game in terms of tankiness usually which can really help round a team composition. AP Kennen can build Rylai's, Abyssal Scepter and Zhonya's all very effectively to become rather resistant, yet AD Kennen is forced into a build path with less defensive structure, meaning you will be less vulnerable and offer less utility to your team through having an effective zoning tool, rather than having to rely on autoing/kiting. His Teleport plays become far more effective with burst from an AP build too.\n\nThis isn't to say that top AD Kennen isn't good! I've played it multiple times and loved it. But if you're looking for long term success in solo queue, it helps to have more to offer to your team through AP Kennen in top lane for a more reliable source of damage through your ultimate and W being easy to use spells. \n\nAlso, having another Magic Damage carry forces your enemy to build more magic resist. Which is quite often harder to incorporate into builds (such as Marksman) which gives your AD carry an easier time in the late game while feeling more protected from a Top lane Kennen with a larger ability to peel and initiate effectively.\n\nIf you need help with a decently effective build Try:\nStart {{item:1055}}  {{item:3020}} {{item:3157}} {{item:3136}}  {{item:3001}} {{item:3116}}  Finish {{item:3151}} Sell Dorans for {{item:3135}} \n\nWhen against AP dominant teams you can go for Abyssal first. Haunting guise is a great snowball item when ahead and have little risk of dying early. It helps your damage output nicely for a cheap spike. Rylais adds to your CC and can help you initiate with a Shuriken on an out of position target to apply a slow, then follow up with W shortly after to extend the slow. This buiold gives you a lot of Armor Magic Resistance Health and Damage, so it's reasonably well rounded. However if you snowball you can go for Deathcap over Liadnry's (Or if they have lots of squishy targets)","replies":[]},{"poster":"andyMak","date":"2016-03-02T13:28:14.090+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I prefer ap still top but im a bad player. \nIve played him top mid supp and adc and love him everywhere.
