I&#039;m not saying getting an S or leveling up champions is hard, but I think players deserve mastery level6 tokens if they get S when the champ just got to level 5. I&#039;m sure that leveling up champions would be hard for some players (like one of my friends is struggling to get lvl6 Anivia) and they probably don&#039;t wanna miss out any chances to get a token. Just wanna see how people react to this :)","replies":[{"poster":"Lord Sesshomaru","date":"2017-07-20T21:17:13.477+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"I agree, technically you ARE lvl 5, so theres no reason why you shouldn't get it.\n\nWhat I hate about the lvl 6/7 is that its just 100% luck.\nDo you happen to get a good game before or after lvl 5?\nit feels so wasted if you get it before.\n\nLike this game:\nhttp://imgur.com/a/M4usO\n\n14/0/1 with 134 CS by 20 minutes, did I feel good after the game?\nno. i felt shit! because I'm only lvl 4 Aatrox and so my good score was completely wasted.\nYou can guarantee that when i get to lvl 5 I wont get an S for aaaaages now. \n\nNo one should come away from a score like that feeling bad, but thats how I felt, just because it happened now at lvl 4 intead of a couple of days from now when ill be llv 5...","replies":[{"poster":"Sniperino","date":"2017-07-21T05:07:06.977+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It might be not 100% luck though. If you did really good at everything it is basically a guaranteed S. That's probably why in challenger games usually everyone gets S. However, for low-rank players or players who are new to the game that really want to level up champs that might actually be a hard thing. I got 5S and 6S- before I got level5 Kayn and now I am only getting A+ and A (well I haven't played a lot after getting lvl5) :\\ Yeah I agree with you that we don't get rewarded a lot by doing good before getting lvl5 champions","replies":[{"poster":"Lord Sesshomaru","date":"2017-07-21T05:44:27.383+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=terryylin,realm=OCE,application-id=Ntey9fRZ,discussion-id=rmBEenlN,comment-id=00020000,timestamp=2017-07-21T05:07:06.977+0000)\n>\n> If you did really good at everything it is basically a guaranteed S. \n\nIts not always that way though, my friend went 39/6/20-something on Eve got A, (not even A+) his farm was decent too.\n\nits a weird system.\n\nand i just did this just now:\nhttp://imgur.com/a/RGkBE\n\nwhich means as soon as I hit lvl 5, ill get nothing for ages! xD\n\n\nits just a lot of luck though, you can either get paired against a braindead Jax, or a 300,000 mastery Vayne.

Well you always got something to improve on. There must be something that can be done better to get an S. I found it harder to get S on junglers. I am a jungle main, used to play a lot of Elise and Vi, and struggled to get mastery level7. However, when I play Kayn, I constantly get S's, probably around 50% of my Kayn game I can get an S. I compared those games to those I had with Elise and I realised I farm less with Elise, Vi etc. and had lower vision scores.","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"QAPLA","date":"2017-07-24T09:34:13.520+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I only ARAM, and you can't get mastery tokens from ARAM, even with S+.\n\nI will never get a champ past lvl 5.\n\nRito plz, if I want to farm I'll play PoE.
