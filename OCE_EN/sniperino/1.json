I just have played 2 games, so far no problem at all. We only have problem of login, we are fine for playing games so here is the method. But this method only suitable for user whose computer has WIFI.\n\n1. Disconnect your LAN or pull the wire off if u r LAN user, and connect ur computer to \"Personal Hotpot\" of ur phone by WIFI\n2. Open LOL and login, u will find that ur able to login\n3. Disconnect Personal Hotpot then connect LAN or the WIFI u used to use\n4. Wait client to reconnect then u r ready to go!\nU will need to repeat dis method every single time u log in\n\nGLHF!","replies":[]},{"poster":"Zaps","date":"2017-07-13T01:57:42.290+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"We're aware of a problem that is causing some players to have problems logging on to League.
