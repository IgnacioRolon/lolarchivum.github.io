And then come into vision...\nWill they see that flower? And know you were there? \nThis is a small flaw I see in the skin, hopefully it doesn't cause too many problems for Kat players out there.\n\nThanks for your time anyway! \nIf anyone has any insight to layeth downeth on me-eth...\nPlease do so.\n\nR.I.P - Shunpo Kick.\n\nSee you soon...","replies":[{"poster":"Lord Sesshomaru","date":"2015-01-14T01:45:13.795+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"It is definitely a cool skin! no doubt about that, i cant say i miss the kick or even noticed it when it was there, i usually try to avoid going near her at all costs \none of the reasons i main Azir \nbut i will definitely be buying this skin,\n\nalso the flower will cause no problems at all, because when she uses shunpo normally, she leaves a cloud of smoke anyway, so there is still a visual indicator no matter which skin you use. so it isn't a flaw its just making the smoke look better.\n\nAlso shunpo is one of my favourite moves in the game just because its taken from bleach so when ever i play kat (which is hardly ever tho) i feel like Byakuya or Soi Feng, or someone. for this reason i think a stab would be cool because thats what byakuya does when you first see him use shunpo, but a kick works too because of Yorouichi or Soi Feng\n\nbut there is 1 reason i dont look forward to this skin being released, as there will be thousands of Kat's instalocking, and while i can beat them as Azir, they are still annoying to fight once the laning phase is over. plus any instalockers on my team means that i cant go mid at all, (remember the project yasuo days)  it could be a blessing in disguise tho, if everyone plays Kat and lots of people get raped and complain, RIOT might start to bring her manaless resets to their attention.\nsimilar to WW and Pantheon recently.\n\nbut either way i will be buying this skin, but i do prefer the Vel'koz one still.","replies":[{"poster":"Kadaj","date":"2015-01-14T02:21:22.582+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thanks for your input dude, you raise a lot of good points.\n\n\nAs to the \"Smoke\" from normal Shunpo, that's about as much indications as having bad eye sight, people will just think they see Kat everywhere.\n\nThe point I try to make is the simple one of...\n\nTake Sona for instance...\nArcade Sona, possibly the coolest skin there is for her, but it tells them directly which debuff she has applied to them, instead of them having to look at the colour of her Aura.\n\nThis could go similar, for the veteran champs to see that Kat has Shunpo'd with the flower, as opposed to just a faint bit of smoke.\n\nUpvotes for input and I would upvote again for the Bleach reference, but I can't. xD\n\n\nR.I.P Ichimaru Gin","replies":[{"poster":"Lord Sesshomaru","date":"2015-01-14T02:50:54.433+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Ok yes that is true it is more noticeable than just a puff of red smoke, i suppose the same way that Arclight varus's W blobs around people are much brighter than his normal skin ones and as such makes them back out of a fight earlier than they might have, which means he misses out on possible damage, \n\nyea you gotta love bleach, poor Gin tho :(","replies":[{"poster":"Kadaj","date":"2015-01-14T04:22:31.056+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I knew he was a good guy.\nNo one smiles like that...
