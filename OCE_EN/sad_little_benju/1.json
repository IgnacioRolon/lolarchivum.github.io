If the report system worked wed just report sit back and smile as we know he is gonna be banned, and we wont see his sorry ass for a month or two because like hell a troll is gonna buy xp boosts on a troll account.\n\nTl;dr: Oce is salty because oce doesnt have a working report system, i am proof of this.","replies":[]}]}
