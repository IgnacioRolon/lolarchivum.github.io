At the least, if you just format your hard-drive, you'd at least still be able to install another operating system onto it, to start over without any existing data.\n\nI think you probably mean something along the lines of defragmentation or optimisation, neither of which will fix underlying problems such as corrupt files or changed dependencies.\n\nHave you tried repairing the client? It takes a while, arguably, but it reduces the chance of the issue being local significantly.","replies":[{"poster":"MikeHunt","date":"2015-03-21T10:22:11.763+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"formating for what i did was boot with window CD in, and formated that patition that ran the system, so everything got wiped as intended coz i had this anoying hidded bug i couldnt get rid of in my browser it was called istartsurf or something, very anoying popups even with popup blocker, but anyways thats how i formatted anyways, i had to reinstall league and google chrome, thats all ive got so far on.","replies":[{"poster":"HORSE OF FORCE","date":"2015-03-24T02:56:32.231+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Ah, I usually say that as \"format and reinstalled my OS\".
