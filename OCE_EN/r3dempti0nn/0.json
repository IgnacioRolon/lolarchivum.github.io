Defending yourself is fine (though rarely productive), retaliating is not. Ultimately, you are responsible for your own behaviour, just as that other player is responsible for theirs.\n\nAnother player being toxic, does not give you the right to be, especially when there are still 3 other players on your team and 8 in the game that now have to deal with two toxic players instead of one.\n\nIn your chat log you're insulting, rank shaming, and telling them to stop talking *a lot*. Consider that you are demonstrating the exact behaviours you are complaining about in that other player, and understand that two wrongs don't make a right. \n\nIt's also worth mentioning that this isn't your first warning for negative behaviour (assuming you don't mean chat restricted when you say banned).\n\nIf you still wish to appeal your punishment you can do so through [player support](https://boards.oce.leagueoflegends.com/en/f/T8eq2lFQ/d/3HtgsaKA?comment=00010000000100000000), but I wouldn't get your hopes up.","replies":[]}]}
