However, They decided to make servers located Asia around Season 2(Garena Taiwan esp.) but I did not transfer as I don&#039;t understand Chinese and all my friends played on NA, this was not a problem until the recently moved the NA servers to Chicago which made me get around 210 ping. I later decided transfer my account because I got an average of 120-140 ping. My problem is that I have been getting high ping recently and sometimes closing the game and reconnecting makes it lower or even back to normal but now it does not seem to work. My ISP is also Netvigator. My friends who use also netvigator have been gettings high ping recently. {{item:3070}} And my friends that don&#039;t use netvigator have been getting normal ping(Obviously in Hong Kong)\r\n\r\nExtra info that could be useful:\r\nAbout 6 Months ago the cable SEA-ME-WE 3 broke down and was the fastest route from Hong Kong to Sydney(Or where ever the oce servers are located in Australia). This was the route that allowed me to get 120-140 ping but because it was broken that time, people from Hong Kong and some other regions in South East Asia got really high ping(Around 200). I&#039;ve heard that they have fixed this cable but I still get over 200 ping and I am not sure about it. Maybe it is taking a longer route \r\n\r\nI hope there is some way to fix this. {{item:3070}}. I am tired of my ping being {{summoner:3}}  and I really want to make it {{summoner:6}}.\r\n\r\n-Tryn down 4 what","replies":[{"poster":"SephirothSG","date":"2016-04-02T08:40:57.801+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey there,\n\nThere was another issue recently with one of the undersea cables.\n\nThis is described [here](http://boards.oce.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/help-support-oce/GYiftAVf-is-anyone-getting-massive-lag-that-wont-stop?comment=00010000) by Agent Mindstar.\n\nSo your best bet is to wait it out, perhaps contact your ISP to work out more information.","replies":[]}]}
