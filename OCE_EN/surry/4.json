While I like them and the ability to change my colors is great, it&#039;s rather a large hindrance that I can&#039;t actually use most of the chromas without owning a skin of some kind. I know this might not always be viable to do, but please riot, try to make chromas for more bases. That way if players like me can get colors for champs I play on occasion but don&#039;t necessarily play enough to warrant buying a skin for. \r\n\r\nThank you for reading\r\nLucky{{champion:78}}","replies":[]}
