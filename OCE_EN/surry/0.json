Rito please","subforum":"Gameplay & Strategy","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"Dear Rito, \r\nSo I commonly read the red posts and surrender@20, but I would very much like to know just why a 50:50 win/loss rate is the aim for the matchmaking system. \r\n\r\nI wonder this as I&#039;ve just clawed my way out of bronze 4 to bronze 1.. with big win streaks, but then suddenly as my win ratio hit 50% (i was on a losing spree before that when i stopped playing ranked months ago) I get paired with players worse than the Bronze 4 players I just finished getting away from. And what&#039;s worse is it makes it very hard to get out of bronze when you hit that wall. I get a bunch of wins, then a huge lot of people who say &quot;first time ahri&quot; then 0-12 after the first 15mins with or without jungle help. Looking at their games played after game.. you see they&#039;ve played 20 games. total. Why? I&#039;m not a bad player,\r\n\r\n i make silly decisions occasionally but in a game designed for 5v5 gameplay.. why is it necessary to pair players  with people they EXPECT to lose.  is the best strategy to get to gold.. lose 3000 games, drop to bronze 5, then get a bunch of wins so you end up in gold at 17w:3000L? since you&#039;ll be paired with people that can play since they&#039;re expecting you to fail them?","replies":[{"poster":"Omni Presents","date":"2016-01-03T05:37:47.430+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Matchmaking is nothing but shit, they don't simply match with players at your skill level, they match the entire game so each team is evenly matched.\n\nThere are 3 reasons for this, one is that while they do try and match evenly skilled players, it is not always possible since this is a team based game.\n\nOne player can have a good run and get to a rank they do not deserve since their team won and not them. Two is that a can have a bad streak and get to a rank they should not be in. And three is that there is not enough players to match an entire game based on personal skill in a short enough time.","replies":[{"poster":"GodlySupport","date":"2016-01-11T09:01:07.924+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Agreed","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"McRuthless","date":"2016-01-04T23:33:56.084+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"High bronze/low silver mmr is the entry level for people just starting ranked. Because of this there will be a wider variety of skill levels than at other ratings because new players haven't played enough games to go up/down to their proper rating yet. \nAnyway, you get just as many bad players on the enemy team, so even if you might not see all the shit they're writing in chat, or not pay as much attention to the 0-10 mid laner when hes not on your team, they are there, and they will win you as many games as they lose you. Other people aren't the reason you've stopped climbing. You're probably making just as many obvious mistakes that you don't even notice.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Neeek ","date":"2016-01-03T07:07:28.663+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Lol","replies":[]},{"poster":"Gravelord","date":"2016-01-03T02:21:43.794+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I guess we need asian people to do the matchmaking system for them, Every Japanese/SK game i have played, the game is so polished and fair, i would assume because they understand numbers.
