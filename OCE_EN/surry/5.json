My question is since we have 20 mastery pages currently, but we have to buy rune pages, and we&#039;re told that we get to keep our pages that we&#039;ve purchased.. Does this mean that any player who wants more than the default two pages now has to buy more rune pages? If so doesn&#039;t that quite defeat the purpose of removing mastery? since a lot of that power was the ability to customize many pages for your own champion pools. \r\n\r\nFor example, \r\nI main poppy support. I currently run a tank mastery page for her\r\nI occasionally play trundle. I use the same runes but different masteries. \r\nI play janna and lulu, different runes, and different masteries. \r\n\r\nI play a lot of others but for this example i&#039;ll settle for those four. \r\nIf I was new and only had the two rune pages i&#039;d have a set of tank runes for 2, and a set of gold generation ap runes for the other 2. \r\nbut my masteries are all different. \r\n\r\nNow do i have to buy two new pages to do the same thing as current? So i need to spend an extra 12k ip/blue essence on rune pages because I can no longer play the four champions that I play optimally?","replies":[]}
