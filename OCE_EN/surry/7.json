Runes purchased after that date_ _will not be refunded. Cactopus explains more on refunds here._\r\n_Conversion on Rune Pages purchased with IP_\r\n_Any rune pages purchased before September 1, 2017 with IP will receive 1500 Blue Essence per page._\r\n\r\nI just want to add my feedback that this is way too low of a refund. Adding all the previous price of my runes up I&#039;ve spent 124,123 ip on runes and since most were bought pre-2017 since i started the game early season 2 i&#039;d get less than a third of their value.  Especially since many of the rune sets that I currently own were the very expensive 820ip runes for marks, seals, and glyphs, and the 2050ip quints.  With the price of these I could have had my champion collection done well before 2017, only having just completed buying them all this year after the thousands of games that I&#039;ve played since starting. \r\n\r\nWasn&#039;t the whole reason for the upcoming changes that it feels bad to buy runes rather than champs, and that buying runes slowed down your champion unlocking? \r\n\r\n_HERE&rsquo;S THE BIG PICTURE: _\r\n_Sometime last year, we started to look into big, long-lasting problems players have with some of the oldest and most fundamental systems in League&mdash;specifically IP, rewards, and leveling. A few things quickly became clear: _\r\n\r\n_- **Spending IP on runes doesn&rsquo;t feel good and comes at the expense of unlocking champs**_\r\n\r\n_- Grinding to unlock champions takes too long, especially for newer players_\r\n_- Lots of players have huge IP balances with nothing to spend it on_\r\n_- The leveling system hasn&rsquo;t aged well and offers nothing to longtime players _\r\n\r\n\r\nWhy then are the people like me who made an effort to collect all the runes they could punished for it by getting much less than the asking price for our work at getting all the ip in the first place to buy all these. I know that there&#039;s some players out there who own them all. and have more IP than I could dream of, but even still, what&#039;s being said at the moment feels like I should have settled with just buying one set of runes and then just saving all my ip. It&#039;d be worth more in the end since I&#039;d still have an extra 70,000ish ip compared to the little i&#039;d actually be getting now.  AND my champion collection would have been complete back in season 4 rather than these few extra years grind. \r\n\r\nPlease reconsider the prices. At least make the return more for the more expensive runes, since a set really could have bought you a champion or 3. (fairly sure my crit damage set is the price of 4x 6300 champions for example)\r\n\r\nThank you for reading and my apologies if I sound ungrateful, it just feels very bad after all the work I&#039;ve put into my rune collection\r\nLuckyCharm","replies":[{"poster":"LunaLovegood","date":"2017-09-02T02:24:41.629+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"RITO I GOT TONS OF PLAY TIME OUT OF THESE RUNES AND CHOSE TO BUY THEM INSTEAD OF CHAMPIONS, WHERES ALL MY FREE STUFF.

Hope you got more use out of your Crit damage runes, and all the other crazy niche expensive runes. Or you would if you had more than  2 generic rune pages. With low cost runes for the most part. \n\nSeriously though, just because you haven't worked at all to get your rune collection up doesn't mean that the rest of us haven't. And 100ip return on a practically unused set of 820ip runes is like saying you'll trade your 2015 ferrari in for that brand new hyandai i30. 8x less value but at least you have a new car right? \n\nHow about being constructive with your arguments rather than trying to troll in all caps hmm?","replies":[{"poster":"Maraudaur","date":"2017-09-02T04:15:39.397+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I made a comment in this thread - https://boards.oce.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/miscellaneous/wKzblahv-thoughts\n\nLet me know what you think =D","replies":[{"poster":"Surry","date":"2017-09-02T07:21:30.561+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey Maraudaur,\n\nThank you for your reply, and i have read your post and while fair i do still think rune prices need to be looked at a little. Take the runes at 205ip, they're 4x less expensive than the ones worth 820ip. Yet when refunded they're currently worth the same, even though it took 4x as much effort to save and buy them. Just doesn't quite seem fair that regardless of price the runes are all lumped together under one banner of 100ip. \n\nI mean the runes worth 205ip are currently valued 4x what the expensive ones were because you can buy more for the same price, thus have gotten more return than a single expensive one. \n\nJust fuel for thought. \n\nAnd as a side note on the same topic, it'd be really awesome if you had 100 or more runes refunded you could get a golden rune summoner icon or something.  Just a little thing to show off that you had worked to get lots of runes","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}
