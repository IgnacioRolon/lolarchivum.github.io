If you're after mid lane champs that aren't necessarily assassin type may I suggest any of the below.\n\nOrianna, Cassiopeia, Anivia. Anivia is my personal favourite and has been since I started playing this game. Whilst all of these champs can still be assassins due to their potential burst. I think you will find them more suited to your style over \"assassins like Zed, Fizz, Akali etc.\" .\n\nHope this helps.\nFog - Formerly lols now back under by old name.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Urgot Bot","date":"2015-01-28T08:39:41.967+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"{{champion:6}}  is a pretty good midlaner...\n\n\nNot really, hes better top.\n\nSwain and Brand are good mages (In my opinion) at the moment, as DFG isn't commonly built on them (Which is getting removed).\n\n{{champion:50}}  - Really good tanky mage who deals sustained AOE damage. Everyone seems to underestimate this guys damage.\n{{champion:63}}  - Really good AOE burst mage. His passive burn combined with Liandry's burn hurts like hell.\n\nBoth of these guys decimate team fights. I recommend them both if you aren't looking for assassins.

I was against a Zed and due to an early surprize from Shaco I fell behind but by mid game I was able to 1v1 him so it worked out. \nWukong does actually do alright against most of the assassins that are being picked mid but I do feel as though if he got matched up against certain mid laners then he may get his ass kicked. \nI was actually planning on getting into him mid a bit more, I even went to youtube and watched the early laning phase for maybe 10-15 games. The reason I was wanting a different mid laner was in case I get a matchup that would wreck me I want to have someone to fall back on.\n\nI don't play Vlad mid, I just listed him as a mid laner because I think that was what his original design was for","replies":[{"poster":"DatEpicPotato","date":"2015-01-27T11:38:52.923+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Well, to be honest, Wukong mid doesn't have many bad matchups aside from mainly ahri and fizz. Most other matchups are skill dependant on how well you can play Wukong. He is also an amazing champ to play mind games with your opponents, and you can actually deny them cs just by standing still while also constantly putting them on edge and making them somewhat paranoid by pressing double s, which makes you seem like you used your w :3.\n\nOf course, this only works when ahead, but your clone is also extremely useful in many situations, and is the main reason why I consider him an assassin. The stealth is useful, it counts as a champion and thus can be used to block skillshots or bait enemy ults, and the obviousness is highly useful for risky jukes.\n\nWukong mid has amazing poke via his e auto q combo, and then simply walk out or w out. If they decide to engage after your combo, the attack speed boost from your dash is highly useful, and the clone can be used in a duel to absorb damage and wait for cooldowns. As a potential top/jungle as well, it means he is a great duelist and the passive easily allows him to transition into a tank, bruiser, or simply give him a bit more survivability as an assassin.\n\nAs for the arguments that he lacks burst and is a sustained damage dealer, it is clearly said by someone who has not witnessed a Wukong mid and have only ever seen tank Wukong. Wukong with a trinity force has devastating burst, and while he lacks insane instant burst like a talon, he makes up for it for having great dps after his burst anyways, along with possibly one of the most powerful ultimates in the game.\n\nOf course, there are matchups where Wukong will lose, and I do recommend that you have a few backups, such as a few mages in case of AD tops, in which case I would recommend Swain, Malzahar or Brand.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Chicken4dinner","date":"2015-01-27T12:53:28.488+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I play Lucian mid lane actually with some very rewarding results, just don't play aggressive until you build static shiv and don't roam until you get infinity edge.\nMost of the time using e to avoid danger positions when \"dancing\" with lane opponents works while lining up your q.\nTry to make use of your passive to execute minions as much as possible\nw is good for proc-ing passive while doing it in the middle of the minion wave allows you to give chase if you gain the advantage.\nreserve your ultimate for \"sniping\" enemies due to its deceptively long range or hounding down enemies who pick up the offensive on you (using e in conjunction too!) however make sure you keep an eye on your mana as your q can quickly cost more then your ultimate\n\nHope this helps","replies":[]},{"poster":"Project Xayah","date":"2015-01-27T04:18:23.101+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"{{champion:133}} freelo.","replies":[{"poster":"Dawaraven","date":"2015-01-27T07:21:21.736+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Tru!!.

So my rule of thumb is pick OP champs that can carry. (Not that I'm Challenger but ever since I figured this out, climbing became much easier) Akali, Kat, Fizz, Syndra, Ahri, LB, Yas, Talon. Generally Assassins snowball harder and looking after yourself can be much easier.

He's really viable and also fun to play with some interesting abilities which aren't exactly stock standard. He's unlikely to be nerfed in the near future IMO as Riot DID just buff his Q...\n-{{champion:55}} Katarina, I used to main Katarina also and had a lot of fun with her.\n-{{champion:84}} Akali, I've just bought her and find her fun to play. However she's just a liiiiitle to strong it seems and might get changed in the future.\n-{{champion:45}} Veigar, He's not your normal assasin but he does have a lot of burst. He's also really cheap so you may as well pick him up.\n-{{champion:7}} Leblanc, I kinda of play her more for personal enjoyment, but she is a viable pick. Destroys Teemo early so that's always nice.\n\nYou might be better with the likes of Ziggs{{champion:115}} , Ahri{{champion:103}} , Twisted Fate{{champion:4}} , Lux{{champion:99}} , Gragas{{champion:79}} , Syndra{{champion:134}}  etc. I haven't played a lot of any of most of the latter list, however you might find them more appealing as I AM more into the assassins.

Twisted fate is the cheapest one you don't have who isn't an assasin and if you can spend 3150 there is the likes of lux, karthus, anivia and karma (who can double as a support).
