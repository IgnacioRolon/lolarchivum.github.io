You should only play ranked if you want to see your rating AND learn and improve from each game. This means not looking at external reasons for losses but looking at your own mistakes in game and how you can get better. Obviously there are some games that are frustrating losses, a dc, an afk , an extremely negative player. But those games are far and few between (in my experience) and you shouldn't let those instances take up too much of your time (don't dwell on the un-winnable games and tilt, focus on the winnable games and what you can do to impact the game more). Don't worry about others just focus on your own gameplay.\n\nPersonally for me ranked has been a great learning experienced and really helped me improve as a player (some of the learning was even applicable in the real world =O ).

Unfortunately for every receptive player that takes pointers well - there is another player who will reply with 'dnt f---- tell me what to do' or 'AFK' \n\nMy most memorable solo Q games were instances when other players were keen to win and open minded to try new strategies such as lane swaps, rotations, etc. on the fly.  Repeatedly telling people to ** focus on their own game only** won't help to encourage this creative behavior...","replies":[]},{"poster":"SumCoolAid","date":"2015-02-17T01:40:28.714+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"My biggest regret is playing ranked back in season 2 when I was literally terrible at this game, I now know I have so much to work on because I didnt actually bother getting better at the game.
