For example, if each bullet dealt 150 damage and 3 hit the same target it would be a collective 450 damage, instead of 3 hits of 150 damage, and only apply one stack of \"Rage\" (Black Cleaver passive). Mind you, I haven't looked into that particular part of his kit.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Champion Skin","date":"2015-11-13T01:54:02.575+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Ehhh....
