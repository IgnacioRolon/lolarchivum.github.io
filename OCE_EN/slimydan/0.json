Off meta picks ofter work well because no-one is expecting it and it throws them off their game a little bit.\n I play Orianna and Ahri support a lot (to practice my midlane champs because midlane is always taken). Despite not taking CS and building a sightstone, GP10 and whatever else my team needs before I build my damage items i generally get called a troll. Usually in lobbies people dodge or get really angry at me for but they can get over themselves and deal with it.

You can also use your clone to body block a Fizz ult.\n\nAlso with skill shot stuns like Xerath's you can clone just before it gets you and he'll think he's stunned you. I've also baited many thresh hooks and slightly less blitz pulls.\n\nAlso this one time a Vayne fired her condemn at me and while it was traveling I cloned and got shot into the wall but because I was already standing by the wall she assumed the clone was me even though it wasn't stunned.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"ViceVersaxD","date":"2015-02-11T19:47:45.121+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Well if you play him against a really high \"click to cast spell\" champion like veigar, you can use the clone to dodge nearly all his damage. its not really about what you play mid (any champion can be played mid) it's the reasoning behind it.","replies":[]},{"poster":"sako","date":"2015-02-11T19:31:04.279+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"you could play him jungle like some korean pros do. but if youre high ranked player people wont argue with you","replies":[{"poster":"SlimyDan","date":"2015-02-11T19:32:55.986+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=sako,realm=OCE,application-id=Ntey9fRZ,discussion-id=bzwJqTlB,comment-id=0002,timestamp=2015-02-11T19:31:04.279+0000)\n>\n> you could play him jungle like some korean pros do. but if youre high ranked player people wont argue with you\n\nI get bored of playing him jungle, that's where I've played him the most.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"22 5 19 20 1","date":"2015-02-11T19:30:38.171+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"mute","replies":[]}]}
