(it isn&#039;t the general, just one i made a long while ago)\r\n\r\nnot game-breaking or anything, but i want to have other groups above it (ie people i duo with, IRL friends) so it&#039;d be great if it could be fixed. :)","replies":[{"poster":"HORSE OF FORCE","date":"2015-05-14T02:00:25.523+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"A possible quick-fix would be to disband that group and then recreate it. It would only be infeasible if you have a lot of friends that aren't in any groups to begin with. If that's the case, you can make *another* group to temporarily store them in as you sort out the initial group. Since friend-groups are linked to accounts, it is very unlikely that it's going to be fixed, so taking action now is probably your best option.","replies":[]}]}
