LF (extremely) dedicated D5 + support player, Auckland based.","subforum":"Team Recruitment","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hi guys,\n\nThink it&#039;s on me to give a quick introduction about myself and my intentions. \n\nFirst and foremost I am a D4 ad, having had started mid-season 3. To this date I&#039;ve always been very outspoken, free-spirited and followed my own journey. I am able to empathize with other people in and out of game, and can most definitely take constructive criticism. I&#039;m still on the rise in terms of LP but progress is much slower, which is what you&#039;d would expect. This leads me onto my next point.\n\nI&#039;m looking for a Diamond 5 + support player who is super passionate about getting into the challenger scene (in hopes to be picked up one day). Far-fetched? I say not impossible. I truly believe working next to someone who carry&#039;s similar traits would help myself and my duo partner, to excel at an accelerated rate. I believe grinding in a net cafe sets the tone and environment to manage long hours of practice. If this means taking small breaks to eat/potentially gym  I&#039;ll do what it takes. I am currently 20. I expect my duo to be able to meet the expectations of long practice sessions and hopefully is fun to work with. Should mention I am studying Finance but there are 24 hours in a day. Add/email me if this sounds like something for you and we can sort our schedules out.  If it doesn&#039;t work out, it doesn&#039;t work out. \n\nIGN: Yeah She Squats\n\n","replies":[]}
