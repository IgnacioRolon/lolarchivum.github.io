Hopefully, we’ll come out the other side more comfortable giving Aatrox balance tweaks in the future.\n\nSo the balance team is not done with him yet. I think no longer taking damage when using Blood Price is a bigger buff than we all realize.","replies":[{"poster":"NIghtshadowb","date":"2017-03-12T06:34:31.933+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"That is a well sounded arguement. However kindred, another champion who had a mini rework with his passive on patch 7.5(Same patch as aatrox) had an increase in play rate from 1.20 to 3.50% and yet his winrate is still well main maintained at 50%. It is clear that there is something wrong with aatrox, as even inexperienced players who play kindred keep him at 50% while aatrox on the other hand tanked to a 38% win rate.","replies":[{"poster":"Klavinmour","date":"2017-03-13T09:46:45.052+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Kindred's passive rework didn't change much at all, and was barely noticed by anyone, a change of pick rate from 1.2% to 3.5% is likely more to do with players who felt Kindred didn't fit the meta at the time before hand and feels that the change to their passive works out.\n\nAatrox went from 0.9% pick rate to 7% pick rate.\nThat's a far greater point here.\nThat's more people than just the few that play the champion before it fell off the boards picking the champion back up.\nKindred only had a spike of roughly double their usual pick rate, while Aatrox has had a spike of SEVEN times.\nThe room for error on statistical analysis is massive for Aatrox when you realise how big those numbers are.\n\nYou can't make an accurate analysis until Aatrox's pick ratio stablises, at which point his win/loss ratio will also stabilise.","replies":[{"poster":"NIghtshadowb","date":"2017-03-13T19:07:20.256+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"He went from 0.5% to 2.15% play rate an increase of 1.65% A little more than kindred who has an increase from 1.28% to 3.67 which is a 1.39%  increase.

Riot didn't really release any info about the buff until after they had done it. It looked strange why aatrox's winrate increased by 3% on that day. It shows that riot HAS acknowledged that the Aatrox rework was underpowered. The buffs aren't enough to bring him out of the gutters  but its nice they acted on it.","replies":[{"poster":"Klavinmour","date":"2017-03-16T12:26:17.630+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It's not even a rework, all they did was change his passive and take away his ability costs.\nIt's a bandaid approach to giving some life to a dead champion while an actual rework is worked on.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Requiemsfire","date":"2017-03-10T18:40:33.706+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"I guess they just wanted to cut away parts of him that made it harder to balance him, replace them with healthier mechanics and see the results after to buff him back up to standards. :o","replies":[]},{"poster":"Your Neighbour","date":"2017-03-10T07:59:46.686+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"Because all the noobs rushing to play Aatrox","replies":[{"poster":"Roguestoney","date":"2017-03-10T09:07:12.378+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"More than likely","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"WoadKethunt","date":"2017-03-10T13:59:53.571+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"some things were improved like his w others were made worse","replies":[]},{"poster":"Klavinmour","date":"2017-03-10T05:21:52.851+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"His win rate only dropped because people are actually playing him now instead of the 5 Aatrox mains.\n\nHe didn't even have a rework, it was a minor update, his ult didn't even get touched at all.\nBarely anything changed on him, and he's just as playable as he was the previous patch.
