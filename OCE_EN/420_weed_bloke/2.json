See, noone else would know, because it's not included in the description, or in the video. ( I just happen to know Rakohus ). I'd suggest crediting the music you use. As a further point, try not to use music that's been used by other people before, as it might feel unoriginal ( I think *u* know who ). Also, not something that matters now, but in the future, if you intend on making a dollar off youtube, you'll have to use songs that are either Copyright free, or songs you have permission to use, otherwise all of your monetization rights are forefeit.\n\n2. the text\nThe exact same font everyone uses, because it's default on like, 5 different editing softwares. Try and spice things up a bit by using different, unique fonts. As an example, check out cooltext.com and get something that's fitting to your style. Try and make it unique, but still easy to read. You can also ( depending on your editing program ) do cool things like animate the text, so it doesn't feel stagnant. If you're subtitling action packed stuff, feel free to get them subtitles shaking a bit.\n\nGOODS\n\n1. the DP\nThe display picture is weird as hell, very click-baity for curious internet dwellers. It worked on me. Keep finding original stuff and keep it all interesting.\n\n2. the Teemo\nf*ck Teemo.\n\n3. the content\nYour gameplay might be average, but you've got a bit of personality, which you can definitely use.\n\nI'm a veteran at this sort of thing, feel free to add me for any questions, comments, or help needed.\n\n~J","replies":[{"poster":"420 Weed Bloke","date":"2015-07-27T11:13:08.462+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"thanks man, your comments are awesome!\nalso, yeah i should be crediting the music.\noops xD","replies":[]}]}]}
