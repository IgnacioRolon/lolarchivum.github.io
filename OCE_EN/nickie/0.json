From my home connection, the OCE server has been at 210 ping flat.\r\nThese have been the ping values for the past month or so, however just today the internet cafe I frequent became a concurrent 200 ping while my home internet has risen to 340.  Another internet cafe I&#039;ve been to rose similarly from 120 to 240.\r\nWould there be any reason as to this seemingly uniform increase in ping while accessing the OCE servers?\r\nBecause all three places I&#039;ve accessed here are under different ISPs.\r\nIf someone knowledgeable of certain happenings from Riot or just tech-savvy individuals could help me out I&#039;d really appreciate it","replies":[{"poster":"lThatFallenAngel","date":"2016-03-29T15:14:00.668+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"happens in hk and overseas as well :/","replies":[]},{"poster":"SephirothSG","date":"2016-03-25T00:02:22.531+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey there, \n\nCould you please download [WinMTR](http://downloads.sourceforge.net/project/winmtr/WinMTR-v092.zip) and run a traceroute to the following IP address (Allow this to run for 5-15 minutes), export the results as text and reply back with them (You can use [pastebin](http://pastebin.com/) for this.)\n\n>103.240.227.5\n\nCould I also get you to run the [ICSI netalyzr](http://netalyzr.icsi.berkeley.edu/) and post back with a link to your results page.\n\nYou mentioned you were connecting from Asia?
