After retrying multiple times I decided to search up a solution, as this has happened before and I was able to fix the issue thanks to the help of google. And so I followed the instructions from various threads which in the past have worked, but this time it didn't turn out so fortunate. Being too lazy to search up any more alternatives, I simply decided to uninstall and reinstall. But upon uninstalling and attempting to redownload the client off of the OCE League site, the 'Download Game' button only redirected me to an error page of, 'this page can't be displayed'. So at this point I have no idea what to do.\r\nAnyone got any ideas?","replies":[{"poster":"Mindstar","date":"2015-01-29T06:54:15.091+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hi,\n\n\nThere is an issue that has hit a few players, relating to their ISP having out of date DNS information.
