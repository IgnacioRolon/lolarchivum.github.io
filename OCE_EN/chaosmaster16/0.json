OK, I saw that notice about people having issues reconnecting. I didn&#039;t think much of it UNTIL this moment. It was at this moment. That I knew. I f***ed up. By the time I got in to queue, I didn&#039;t have the second notice, saying that I should restart my client. Who knew I would get placed in lower priority for something that the system had an error with... You should have at least turned the LeaverBuster system off if you can&#039;t get people out of Lower Priority Queue. Because I remember seeing a statement from Riot saying that they can&#039;t take anyone out of lower priority queue to avoid corruption...  If I even got that message which wasn&#039;t possible because on the reconnect screen, where it sys &quot;Game is still in progress&quot; or &quot;Your game has crashed, Reconnect&quot;, the notice signs don&#039;t show up. So of course, I tried to reconnect several times and even waited out the whole thing to see it it loads until the game ended, and I was placed in lower priority queue. I know it was stupid of me to not try to restart my client, but... seriously? If I asked for support, you would probably send a ticket saying &quot;send us various files from your game/client&quot; which 80% of the time no ones bothered, which leads to frustration.\r\n\r\nI don&#039;t know what to say but if I had to be 100% honest I would say: Get me out of lower priority queue, or something of an equal value that makes up for the time I would lose on waiting for that BS.","replies":[{"poster":"HORSE OF FORCE","date":"2015-04-24T12:16:33.681+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'll just tell your the truth; it's not likely going to happen.
