His Q blinds any auto-orientated champion, and his poison deletes their health before they can get shots in.\n\nBut in terms of sole melee, Nasus after with anything around 400 stacks and maxed R is a hard task. At very least 20% life steal, and his abilities mean staying in melee range solo is a very hard task. Anyone with lifesteal in fact is a difficult opponent. Aatrox is another. He has life steal and you effectively have to kill him twice. Master Yi is pretty good with his final build. Not early game, but late game he usually has life steal, high auto speed and damage and his Q can negate damage if he dodges correctly. WW is the same with final build, especially with a Devourer jungle build. \n\nI have to disagree with the other commentors though. Sion is not a decent 1v1 champ. If he builds for health, he doesnt have enough damage, and even then if he got lucky, he's too slow to chase after any champion that runs. If he builds for damage, he won't have enough health to sustain himself in a fight. The only way he'd be suitable is if he hypothetically got a horrendous amount of health from farming, but had been building for damage.","replies":[]},{"poster":"TeCoolMage","date":"2015-09-20T12:39:35.693+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Definitely not an assassin.
