I run a few TS rooms which are mostly active (details will be in MOTD) which also bring some laughs to the table. \r\nJust a few requirements:\r\n-Able to have a good laugh\r\n-Respectful to others (Although much ridiculing/banter is to be had in TS)\r\n-Have a small sense of maturity when it calls for it\r\n-Enjoy ARAM\r\n\r\nIf you&#039;re interested add me and throw me a line on League IGN: Hoaxi\r\n\r\nARAM Shenanigans","replies":[{"poster":"Rhynal","date":"2018-09-19T08:16:40.614+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Club still running ?
