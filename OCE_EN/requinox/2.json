I told him to buy MR but he wouldn&#039;t listen to me and kept building just full AP (He played Brand.) Now the enemy team had brand as well. \r\n\r\nThe question is, how do you win a game or deal with a team that does not listen to advise?","replies":[{"poster":"Kill the adc","date":"2017-11-03T22:21:30.969+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"If they don't listen to advice after the first instance, then they usually won't listen any further attempts to help out. With that knowledge the best strategy is to focus on how you can better carry or assist the player or team knowing that there more susceptible to magic damage. That could be to try and focus the ap champs more with cc and damage or just help gank their lane more if the player is over extending.","replies":[]}]}
