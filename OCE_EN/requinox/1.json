It actually takes longer to level up not faster. for example, I was level 21 with 940 exp to go to reach level 22. When the system updated that changed to 2400 xp to reach level 22. How does that work and how does that actually help us level our accounts?\r\n\r\nWhat makes matters worse is I only earn about 100-150 xp per game. So about average of 130. 2400 divide by 130 is about 19 won games to reach level 22 etc. let alone losses which only give about half that amount. \r\n\r\nThe first win of the day bonus helps with the 575 bonus XP however it still takes too long to level.\r\n\r\nDoes anybody here have the same issue? As this puts me off playing mostly because I want to reach level 30+ but its going to take weeks and weeks. Unless I buy an XP boost , even then it will take a while. \r\n\r\n\r\nRequinox | ADC Main | {{summoner:7}} {{champion:18}}","replies":[{"poster":"Best Evelynn OCE","date":"2017-11-09T05:35:17.166+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"I had the exact same thing, made a post about it (which Riot conveniently ignored) and even sent a ticket to Riot Support, but they just beat around the bush and avoided the question.\n\nOne Rioter even had the gall to send an entire message about XP Boosts... LITERALLY encouraging \"pay to play\".\n\nEvery single month, Riot just keep providing players with more evidence that they don't really care about us. Flat out lying to us (making leveling way more time consuming even pre-30 than before) and tying the only (and incredibly feeble) BE income to leveling means they are slowly beginning to turn into a \"pay to play\" game where you either pay $10 for a new champion or grind for several weeks.","replies":[{"poster":"Mindstar","date":"2017-11-09T06:03:47.881+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":4,"body":"Just checking in on this - I had a look at your games too.\n\nIt is probably worth calling out that Bot games are definitely not the most optimal way to gain XP at lvl 20+.   They are usually shorter, and they also give less XP per game.   [There's a formula here](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752824-Reward-BE-XP-System-Breakdown) which explains the ratios, but after lvl 20, you only get 80% XP for Co-op vs AI (65% if you play a LOT of games).\n\nThe longer games you played also gave the proper amount of XP (200+), so it does seem to be working as intended.\n\nCheers\nMindstar","replies":[{"poster":"Best Evelynn OCE","date":"2017-11-09T06:22:45.723+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"Naturally you are keeping out the fact that you increased the amount of XP required. \n\nI wasn't complaining about the XP gains which are the same, but the fact you outright lied by saying you level to 30 quicker than before AND THEN NEARLY TRIPLE THE AMOUNT OF XP YOU NEED.\n\nDoesn't take a PhD in Maths to understand that if you increase the amount of XP you increase the time taken.

I'd strongly suggest taking a look as it goes into the maths a bit further.\n\nMort's post:\n> Yes, the amount XP required went up.

In addition, First win of the day is HUGE, at 575 XP.\n> So we're pretty sure that most players will level up quite a bit faster.\n> EDIT: Since people wanted more examples, here they are:\n> 32 min win: Before 121 XP, After 211 XP\n> 21 min win: Before 100 XP, After 138 XP\n> 36 min loss: Before 77 XP, After 238 XP\n> ONE MORE EDIT: Ok, last bit of info...the old system actually over rewarded quick games. We wanted to make it more fair, so XP is actually just based on time played now. (with a small variance for win/loss)\n> To get from 29-30:\n> Old - 1380XP.

Thus makes it slower to level up in the long run.  To me it seems that in order to level up I need to win 1 game per day just to gain the 1st win of the day bonus. \n\nLegitimately I could have levelled up a whole lot faster on the old system. But don't get me wrong I'm all for the uncapped levelling system and new runes system they are awesome. But having it harder for us to level to level 30 is not making this at fun. I wish I could purchase an XP boost but I cannot afford that unfortunately :( as with an xp boost, at least I half the time required to get to level 30. After reaching the level 30 milestone, I do not care how long it takes to level up from there.\n\nI'm not trying to argue here but I just feel that the XP requirements our off.","replies":[{"poster":"Gehirn","date":"2017-11-09T07:29:16.071+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Hi Requinox, info from [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/7bqrou/explanations_on_why_the_be_system_is_a_major/dpk8mmy/) may be helpful:\n\n\"(the xp) curve was designed with 30 minute games as the average. (If over time we see that average drop, we will adjust the curve.)\"\n\nGames right now are shorter than average, and if this keeps up then it is possible we'll adjust the XP curve to feel better.\nBut games being shorter due to preseason changes is actually something we've seen in multiple previous years.\n\nPlayers are re-discovering the game, making new mistakes and new OP strats - so the game is a little snowballier as players adjust to the new style of play. I would bet LP that game length will increase again eventually as players learn how to play with and against all the new strategies that Runes Reforged has brought about.","replies":[{"poster":"Requinox","date":"2017-11-09T07:57:40.804+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Maybe Maybe not.\n\nHowever its besides my point. Levelling in my case is taking forever.\n\nI get that its a game and levelling is the point and their is no rush to level. But again XP is tripled and a bit. whilst XP gain is only doubled. You might be right about the pre-season games being shorter due to people learning the new system etc. But that does not help me now. All I really want to do is play ranked. but instead I'm stuck playing norms for probably another 100 games.\n\nI like change, I legitimately Love the levelling Rewards it gives and the uncapped levels. And I do somewhat get the the XP required to level is higher to mix in well with the levels 30+ to even it out. But it IS harder to level without a boost. which I cannot afford. Why not add boosts to the levelling up rewards system? Say at level 25 I might get a 10 game xp boost (Win or lose). then again at level 28 or 29 I might get a 5 game XP boost. As a chance of randomness. \n\nI just want to play ranked, I'm not some new player trying to work out the game or anything and I'm not rushing into things trying to just play ranked so I can climb the ladder. I'm a genuine player that wants to enjoy the game and the challenges it gives. In ranked its meant to be a challenge. I cant do that until I get to level 30.yet I'm still 7 levels away. \n\nI'll even that down to 6 levels away. at an average of 2450 xp required to reach each level.\n\nLets also put down that I play 30 minute games each time. Earning me 211 XP per win. That's about 12 Wins per level plus the daily bonus of 575 XP. But that's IF I win all those 12 games. \n\nRealistically it would probably take about 14-15 games to reach a level IF I play 32 minute games which equals 480 minutes or 8 hours to level even just one level. Which actually works out to be 16 games in the end. \n\nThen I'm assuming as per normal, that each level requires MORE XP which equals more game and more hours etc etc.\n\nSorry for the rant, I'm trying to get my head around this whole system because its completely different. \n\n\nCheers,\n\nRequinox","replies":[{"poster":"JasonWazza","date":"2017-11-09T16:27:20.721+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Here's the low down, If your a casual player and play only for first win of the day, you climb faster.\n\nGeneral grinding on a daily basis, and your going to take a crap load longer.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Mindstar","date":"2017-11-09T05:51:52.456+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey Requinox\n\nI had a quick look at your account because the numbers you mentioned seem a bit low.

End your game as fast as you can is one of the rule of thumbs of climbing ranked (and winning any games in general).  This also encourages players to surrender early: people who hate their opponents now have the choice of \"punishing\" them by giving up quickly and make them earn much less XP, while in the old system these people would tend to \"punish\" their opponents by struggling for longer and hopefully kill their opponents a few more times before the game ends.\nThe strong emphasis on first win of the game is also something I cannot understand.  Riot is now punishing players who player a lot of games a day by boosting the reward from first win and reducing the amount you get from games without the first win boost.  The new system is definitely discouraging these players from playing as much as they used to.  I have never heard of any game improving themselves by reducing the incentives of playing.  Even the main player base does not play 20 games a day, it doesn't mean that you should punish those who do.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Requinox","date":"2017-11-09T06:58:58.820+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Agent Mindstar,realm=OCE,application-id=FjGAIbRv,discussion-id=mcvKeVwY,comment-id=0001,timestamp=2017-11-09T05:51:52.456+0000)\n>\n> Hey Requinox\n> \n> I had a quick look at your account because the numbers you mentioned seem a bit low.
