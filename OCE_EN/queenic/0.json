I haven't left any other game but this ONE GAME, so why the hell do I have this low priority queue T-T it's so frustrating because I actually don't think I deserve it... lol ughhh riot seriously! get your shit together PLEASE and take this low priority bullcrap out of my name - thank you.","replies":[{"poster":"ToxicHawk","date":"2015-02-09T03:22:03.387+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey Queenic,\n\nIt does take more than one AFK/Leave to be placed in a low priority queue.\n\nThat being said, I would suggest getting your laptop checked out if it just randomly decided to crash. There could be a bigger problem at hand, such as a software or hardware error.\n\nI do feel sorry that you have been placed in the low priority queue due to a crashing laptop, but we are unable to remove you from this. Unfortunately if we were to do this, then it could potentially be abused by players forcefully shutting down their computers just to try and avoid a low priority queue because they want to AFK a game they believe they can't win.\n\nFrom what I can see you don't have many games remaining in that queue, so it shouldn't be long and you will be back to normal.\n\nAgain I am sorry you have experienced this, and I really would suggest getting your laptop checked out.\n\n-ToxicHawk","replies":[{"poster":"Queenic","date":"2015-02-09T04:06:07.053+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"alright thank you for your response. yes I agree, I might be getting a new computer since I've had this macbook for too long. :( but aw stupid low priority queue lol","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"HORSE OF FORCE","date":"2015-02-08T23:44:17.728+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"What's the specs of your laptop?","replies":[]}]}
