Well as we all know there are 4 Ultimate Skins out now Pulse fire Ezreal, DJ Sona, Spirit Guard Udyr and or course Elementalist Lux But as you can see each has a main role Lux {{champion:99}} (mid laner), Udyr{{champion:77}}  (jungler), Sona{{champion:37}}  (support) and Ezreal{{champion:81}}  (adc) so that leaves only the top lane which doesn&#039;t have a Ultimate Skin for a champion who&#039;s main role is top lane. Another factor that goes into this is also the fact that all Ultimate Skins on those champions can in somewhat change form, E.G. Sona with her Kinetic, Ethereal and Concussive, Ezreal when he reaches levels 1, 6, 11 and 16, Udyr who can change between Tiger, Turtle, Bear and Phoenix and Lastly Elementalist Lux with her 10! Different forms Light, Fire, Water, Nature, Air, Ice Magma, Mystic, Storm and Dark. So these might be clues onto who the next Ultimate skin is for. Some Champions that fit these categories are Lee sin {{champion:64}} (sometimes taken as a top laner), Jayce {{champion:126}} (maybe Kha&#039;Zix {{champion:121}} Because of his evolutions) and Nasus{{champion:75}}  because of his Ultimate. But we also have to think of all the champions that don&#039;t have Legendary Skins like the few I have suggested(except Nasus). With all these factors included into the choosing of the next Ultimate Skin it does narrow down the champions that could get this amazing Skin, but then again this is all just a theory and we don&#039;t really know for sure. Write who you think and want to be the Next champion that get the Ultimate Skin.{{sticker:slayer-jinx-catface}}","replies":[{"poster":"Fitzky","date":"2017-02-23T09:54:11.846+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Ultimate Dunk Lord Darius {{champion:122}}","replies":[{"poster":"FatedSaviour","date":"2017-03-01T10:05:33.897+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Dunk Lord Lord?

It's crystal clear. But in all seriousness they will probably give it to the most played top laner. or JG because Udyr is top and JG.","replies":[{"poster":"FatedSaviour","date":"2017-03-01T10:04:59.842+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"only a legendary, rip","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"SEKAI","date":"2017-02-23T07:52:35.423+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Besides Udyr being more or less a special case where his ultimate skin was probably originally meant to be his visual update, the rest of the characters who have received their ultimate skin got it for no reason other than their fan popularity or simply being Riot's poster child.\n\nGoing with the idea, the next character to receive an ultimate skin is probably either Ryze, Katarina or Lee Sin.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Talon12","date":"2017-02-23T07:36:02.274+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Stop thinking about it now its 2 years away still\n\nAnd udyr was a viable toplane and pretty strong at it when he got is ultimate.","replies":[]}]}
