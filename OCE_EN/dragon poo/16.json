It just shows you've played that champ a lot and racked up the points you could still be bad with them.\nIs this post based on the fact you had a yas who died 18 times? Why didn't you buy mikaels to deal with Elise cocoon, Leona stuns or Noc fear? That item may have effected the outcome i don't know i can only make conclusion based upon last game stats.

What then? do you luckily have a flex pick or a Master 4 Zac at the ready?

But i've seen Morgana's break open a game i've seen blitzcranks put 4 people on his back and cho choo to fucking victory, countless zyra's 2v1ing the botlane. As with every role the better you get the harder you climb, very FEW people are stuck with support the ones who are autofilled. Everyone else chooses to be in that positions one way or another.

I disagree that support is boring however since the role can vary so much from babysitting an incompetent adc so they don't feed, all the way to balls to the walls aggression for the mechanically amazing adcs, to zone the enemy botlane and setup kills and snowball the lane as fast as I possibly can, so they can end laning phase fed and carry. In lanes where the adc is passive and just wants to farm, I find nothing more exciting than rushing to midlane as soon as both botlane backs to do the the lvl4 roam to hopefully kill the enemy midlane and to put them on a hilarious tilt streak where they flame their jungler in allchat about how the support has ganked their lane more than the jungler ect...","replies":[{"poster":"Vhaegor","date":"2016-10-13T12:36:50.456+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"But I could do all these things in Mid, Top and sometimes even ADC.
