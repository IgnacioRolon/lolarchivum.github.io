The problem here is when i proc her w passive as a last hit, it will give me the kill. not once has the passive popped and given her the kill, why is thing? i am her soulbound as well, but it is just a pain when i try to give her kills and just take them because the passive does not work. :c it makes bad games worse and good games annoying, so please fix it riot.","replies":[{"poster":"dragon poo","date":"2015-05-13T05:27:54.435+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"sorry about the boards thing, also I've found its between auto attacks from kal, as her autos hit it resets the w passive and takes it away momentarily, which is generally when my auto hits, it still gives the damage but doesn't actually give her the kill.","replies":[{"poster":"HORSE OF FORCE","date":"2015-05-13T11:33:18.855+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"For future reference, use the \"Reply\" button to make sure the person you're talking to gets notification about it. ;)","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"HORSE OF FORCE","date":"2015-05-12T07:35:25.777+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Very strange; I don't experience this when playing as the soulbound to Kalista. The damage soulbound procs is coded to be sourced from Kalista, so that kills are properly accredited to her by kills gained from her passive, BUT if you attack an enemy champ and kill them with your auto-attack without the assistance of Kalista's passive (or you deal enough damage with your auto anyway) then you will be the one whom gets the kill. You might want to test this out a bit before making a bug report on [the correct board](http://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/bug-report).","replies":[]}]}
