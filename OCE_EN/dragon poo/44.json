Warlords bloodlust. Warlords has become such an issue in lane becasue 20% lifesteal is massive. It&#039;s literally a bloodthirster worth of lifesteal, and it basically makes you unkillable early. most adcs take it, other than jhin and the occasional ez. there is a reason blodthirster existas adn was rushed first item. now with warlords, you can basicallt have a soraka in alne without having raka in the game. its so oppressive.","replies":[{"poster":"CHEESYLEEKS","date":"2017-01-25T07:02:54.314+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Why not have both\n\nFlash is overrated","replies":[{"poster":"Talon12","date":"2017-01-25T08:32:58.105+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I mean, what lane shaco doesn't take ignite and exhaust.

That said, if the support wants to carry, then ignite is definitely the better option, since it has alot more early pressure in lane. Ignite also tends to outperform exhaust if nobody ganks or tps down to botlane fights which can definitely happen in low elo. Exhaust only really shines in lategame teamfights , or as a supplementary form of cc, in botlane combos that lack any cc to help the jungler gank. With the current state of the game, earlygame matters alot more and hence ignite is generally better to take.\n\nOther issues with exhaust is I see too many supports using it way too late. Exhaust should be popped during the initial discharge of all the damage cooldowns so that your adc can do more damage, and their adc(or mage sometimes) does less damage. Exhaust shouldn't be saved, it should be popped the moment, a trade turns into an all-in. This is another reason ignite generally outperforms exhaust.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Transcender","date":"2017-01-25T23:02:54.315+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"You should also build full ap, let the adc build sightstone, and while you are at it, take all of their farm, cause it is not your job to give them as much gold as possible and give them every opportunity and advantage in every situatuation.","replies":[]}]}
