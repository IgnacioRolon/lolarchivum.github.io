That's a little smallminded and racist tbh. While I don't blame people from Garena from playing on our server - you think OCE is cancer? - try playing low ELO on Garena - that's real cancer! 90% of the low players on Garena are girls only playing to gain a 'gamer-girl' tag while looking for boyfriends. I've only played 20 or so games there but after every one of them had anywhere between 1-3 clueless girls giggling in chat, acting all helpless and shit and doing stupid stupid things *and being forgiven for it because they are girls* I uninstalled the Garena client and never went back. That was in every game. Not lying! I know it's not all like that post lvl30 and once you get higher ELO but the getting there was going to do my head in, I could tell. It's very very cringey. \nBut... there are just as many non English speaking people on OCE from the Philipines, Malaysia, Fiji, Sri Lanka, India and Singapore (which is technically China *and* Garena) playing here. And don't forget there are a LOT of Asian students living in Au ad NZ while they go to school or Uni and if they are playing with a group of friends they will tend to speak their first language - which won't be English - simply because it's easier. \nBut, regardless, I've played with a heap of people living outside the OCE region and, when asked, most of them say they play on OCE because **is** English speaking. Go figure. A few have tried Garena and choose OCE because of the language, they all speak English fairly decently as a 2nd or 3rd language, but mainly because - though Garena is closer and with lower ping - OCE is less 'cancer'.\nThere's going to be dicks, bads, salty and toxic players wherever you go. Ever play on NA before OCE existed? Try Garena. Have a go on the EU servers, or LAS. One thing most of those negative players all have one thing in common is that they are low skilled players. It's not a language barrier that makes them ignore pings or keep engaging on their enemy laner and dying and not taking advice or threatening to report you if you do give them advice and it bruises their princess egos. It's simply because, whatever race they are or language they speak, they are shit terrible players.  \nUnfortunately the only way to avoid them is to only play during peak times so the law of averages means you will get more English speaking players, or to only play full premade with your own friends, or to get better so you get to play with better people... which is hard because playing with muppets like that is like trying to run a 100m sprint on ground made of quicksand. And they are the quicksand.","replies":[{"poster":"dragon poo","date":"2016-07-27T15:55:28.658+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"So, i know they are chinese because i know the shape of the symbols in post game chat, and sometimes they will type a single word, i dont rememebr what it is exactly but i looked it up on google translate and it translated from simplified chinese to english as \"idiot\" or \"fool\" or something along those line but not as nice. i have no clue what garena is. i understand where you are coming from, btu in a team full of english speakers the one mid lane yasuo or whatever they may be , being rude, and not actually listening to pings and stuff, is unsportsmanlike conduct and shoudl be reported and punished as such.","replies":[{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2016-07-28T04:40:22.287+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Garena controls the SEA (South East Asia) region, which includes China, Singapore etc. \n\nSaying all Chinese players are toxic is like saying all girl gamers are streamers. Just because that is the only group you see, doesn't mean it's the only group that exists. Just as there are many girl gamers that don't stream, there are also plenty of Chinese players who aren't toxic.\n\nThere is a _certain _ validity to the stereotype, the greater _**visible**_ population of Chinese players tends to be the ones that flip their shit and start typing garbage in chat in Chinese. HOWEVER, non-Chinese players are just as likely to do this, we just notice it less because it isn't different, and therefore lacks the distinguishing factors that would prompt us to remember it more clearly.\n\nAnd all that said, I've also seen plenty of Chinese players engaging in banter with their premade and with the team (even if their English isn't so good) and generally having a good time. Fact is the not toxic ones often see no reason to talk in chat, therefore you can't distinguish them from any other player.\n\n>~~ btu in a team full of english speakers~~ the one mid lane yasuo or whatever they may be , being rude, and not actually listening to pings and stuff, is unsportsmanlike conduct and shoudl be reported and punished as such.\n\nThis is precisely the point.

It is simply due to other players on other regions having different play styles and to them, even if you are planning it, to go 0/3 in ANY point of the game is bad.\n\nTo me going 0/3 is nothing as long as you are not tons of CS and too many levels behind. If you are purposely doing it, like in Siege mode to stop the enemy pushing and force them to go B or stop them taking a tower, sure, no problem. But if you are top lane and 0/3 by the 5 minute mark, maybe not.\n\nBut again, since other servers have different play styles they come here for an easy win and when they see someone do something stupid, make a mistake or have 1 death more than they do, they run around calling you bad and how you should stop playing, I see it all the time too, not to mention the weird ass symbols (no thanks to not having language packs installed) and Asian words that show up in chat, it makes it quite difficult to communicate with them and work together, they just see you as a lower class player and give you shit for it.\n\nRegion lock would work, if you are within a certain region based on your IP (yes, it is easy enough to get around), than the game should recognise this and stop you making accounts on other servers, you have your own server for multiple reasons, most importantly lower ping so you can play at your most optimal level.","replies":[{"poster":"dragon poo","date":"2016-07-27T13:09:36.526+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":2,"body":"Thank you, although, i dont midn it as much in siege, more so in ranked. when we were already giving advice to our jungler who's main was banned.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Cyrater","date":"2016-07-27T15:16:05.548+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"Yeah they talk in boxes or swears nothing else.
