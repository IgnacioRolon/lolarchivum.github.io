Riot aren't going to ban a player for not knowing how to play.

I'm pretty tolerant myself and regardless of what is said to me I will always try my best to be of use to a team but jesus there have been times where I've felt like going up and getting exectued by gromp repeatedly for the rest of the game because everyone on my team is so nuclear level toxic and I don't feel like they deserve my help.","replies":[{"poster":"dragon poo","date":"2016-08-18T06:05:55.740+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"im pretty sue we threw a 5k gol lead becausewe didnt fight 5v4 becuase their nasus was top.  i legit asked nicely so much, and it just got so frustrating to the point that maybe the \"group up you stupid f**k\" might have worked. it was a last in vaina attempt to get our wukong to group with us.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Nightjar","date":"2016-08-18T05:36:24.661+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"These games are so tilting and I report people for flaming in general so long as I feel that the person on the receiving end was genuinely trying their best.

Especially in soloQ where proper follow up is rare so don't expect engage whenever you feel like it. It's their call, you might just be positioned bad and so they decided it's not a fight you guys can win which is sometimes completely true. Also people who use the kalista ult and fuck up the timing and blame the sup for not extending the range of the ability or wait till the enemy is right on top of them and they are about to die; don't blame the alistair.\n\nThese threads are just like those 'oh junglers don't gank enough', 'oh supports are supporting enough', 'oh the toplaner isn't tping enough', 'oh the mid lost lane and didn't carry' or 'oh the adc has 6 farm at 20min (okay this one is annoying)'. \nStop complaining, often it's not all their fault. Maybe that jungler didn't gank because you were pushed out and got invaded with no help, maybe the support can't support enough because you went 0-5 before 3min like an idiot, maybe the toplane has been camped and had to use tp to save his tower, maybe the midlane just got outplayed (like seriously you can't always win your lane) or maybe the adc had to deal with a sup that was busy wandering out around dragon pit and had to fight a 2v1 which became a 3v1 whenever someone roamed.","replies":[{"poster":"Nightjar","date":"2016-08-18T05:28:35.046+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Also keyword, engage. Not go in blindly and try to 5v1. yes they want to initiate, yes they want to blow some big cds, but they are also aiming to sponge up as much damage as possible and then get out ALIVE. Now how can they be sure to get out if you damage dealers aren't in position to wipe the enemy team out as soon as they go in and draw focus?\nEngage champions who always engage and always go 5v1 when nobody else can back them up are much worse than a cowardly engage champ who will only go in when the fight is heavily weighted in your favour.","replies":[{"poster":"dragon poo","date":"2016-08-18T06:03:42.453+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"SO when everyone else is ready for the bgi wukong engage, all got our poisitions right and said wukog then tps top to stop half a minion wave, thats what im talking about, and for the record, he tp onto the enemy 5 doing elder while we were at base defending inhibs, it was just a bad experience all aroudn and it tilted me really hard.","replies":[]}]}]}]}
