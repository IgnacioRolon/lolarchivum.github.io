LP is based of straight up win loss (since performance will average out) and I believe MMR is the same, however given that Riot's calculations for MMR are hidden it could very well be based on some kind of performance metrics. In fact it may even be why the calculations are hidden, so as not to disclose what is used to determine performance so it can't be abused.\n\nIf MMR is based on performance then yes, and visa versa, but that's something we just don't know.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Yasei Doubutsu","date":"2016-12-08T07:08:41.132+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yes more wins usually = a better ranking.
