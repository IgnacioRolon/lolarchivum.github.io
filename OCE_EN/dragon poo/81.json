I ALWAYS ping for dragon respawns, missing enemy on the mini map, if they don't listen or care there is little you can do. The thing that becomes really annoying is those in high elo, that spend time in lower elo trolling to keep their position, people don't want to take advice or learn as they think they already know they are pro.","replies":[]},{"poster":"dragon poo","date":"2016-12-08T14:50:33.590+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"believe me, i try to make mayself heard as much as poss, but when your team cant understand the benefits of grouping on an objective,  or even to build a defensive item, things get a bit shit.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Avago ya mug","date":"2016-12-09T02:36:00.247+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It is extremely difficult to climb as a support, being a support myself I know the feels. Basically you can support well, the other members feed then you become high value target for the gold. I found learning to carry as a support to be helpful, other team members will get upset but you can ensure victory with a good Leona/morgana/annie support. Once you hit Gold 1 and higher then you need to revert back to support role, makes it a little hard as you have to change your play style as you climb.","replies":[{"poster":"FatedSaviour","date":"2016-12-14T03:02:36.712+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"wierd thing is, i put sup primary and mid secondary, two games in a row our mid laner was duo'd with the adc and traded with me, how, does that exist","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"FatedSaviour","date":"2016-12-14T03:01:31.614+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"if u can get ahead go for it, but be careful not to make the enemy go ahead, i find that with a lot of games with sion support, if i get ahead, i can usually turn getting ganked by the enemy into a double kill for my adc, for some reason the enemy support always gets away, there are just two alternatives that work for me, GO FULL OUT AGGRO AND TRY TO GET AHEAD EARLY, or if u have a really late game adc, take things slow and play more of a guardian, not jumping on top unless to save the adc","replies":[]},{"poster":"He Meant Mine","date":"2016-12-08T17:03:21.564+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Depends what you mean by carrying. If you want champs i suggest leona (great tank with cc, good engage/lock downs, depending on experience can carry etc) janna whose a really good cock block even if played bad or wrongly, lulu can deny people and just bring utility and nami depending on the team.\nIf you want mechanics, things like learning when to go in, denying cs or zoning enemies, roaming, poking, rotations etc are good to learn when trying to carry. An example can be leaving your adc in a secured bot lane and roaming mid to give secure kills (depends on support) or rotating mid after bot is gone. If u want help i can help u :D","replies":[]}]}
