I mean, you may as well change the name to &quot;5 second slow every 2.5 minutes&quot;. You NEED that attack speed slow to help in not lane, the mr and armour debug also helped supports stack on a little more damage with autos, when it was needed. How does one deal with a vayne, draven, Caitlin, any auto attacking champion in lane short of buying a 2k+ gold item that does less than exhaust. You forget exhaust isn&#039;t about catching the enemy laner, it&#039;s also about letting your laner live if getting out traded. Not lowering the attack speed is gonna just kill the spell and it&#039;ll only bee seen top and mid.","replies":[{"poster":"DiamondAries","date":"2017-03-09T03:41:19.876+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I feel like the only questionable thing about the nerf was the atk spd reduction being removed.

You could be right in that it is too far of a nerf, I had a similar feeling when I first looked at it. (Though I haven't tried it in game yet as a support.)\n\nHowever, when you think about it exhaust is a summoner that you take against the champions you mentioned as a support almost always and that's expected of you. But now you have a bit more of a choice between do you want that defensive exhaust or do you want to risk it and go for the ignite for example and _\"Risk it for the Biscuit\"_.\n\nThis creates meaningful choice even in the summoners that you take and makes every game different. Opening paths to different playstyles and opportunities. My understanding is Riot is trying to find that balance so there isn't always one best answer that is obvious. \n\n---\n\n_If you want a bit of a read about meaningful choice Riot did a blog post on it here:\nhttp://na.leagueoflegends.com/en/news/game-updates/features/lol-design-values-depth-meaningful-choices _\n\n---\n\nWith that in mind, in comparison to the other summoners such as ignite as a support do you think it puts exhaust in this good pocket with this change of still good, but not an always take?\n\n~Elam","replies":[]},{"poster":"Maraudaur","date":"2017-03-09T04:03:21.796+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It still reduces movement speed by 30% AND reduces damage dealt by **40%** for 2.5 seconds. 40% is still massive imo.
