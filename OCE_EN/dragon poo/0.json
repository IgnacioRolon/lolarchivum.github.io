Yea why not, lets brand toxic people just like Germany did with the Jews cause that went well. Branding them for toxicity is just gonna  create for toxicity, and the whole point of them getting banned is so they can reflect on what they have done and change, putting a ribbon and branding them is just contradicting. That's like putting a sign on a guy who just got out of prison saying how bad he is. How is that gonna help him or anyone around him. And plus, how many people in game gives a shit if you have a ribbon? How many people have came up to you and was like \" Welp shit, you have a Ribbon for good team mate? great job\" No one has. So take this trash idea of your and put them in the bin, try coming up with something actually logical","replies":[{"poster":"bgentle2myashe","date":"2016-09-23T20:11:13.759+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"A) You're insinuating that you don't make judgement's or \"brands\" on people by claiming it shouldn't be done at all. That's a straight up lie. You're just as human as the next person and it is a part of humanity to judge all things. Same as we are born hypocrites and contradict ourselves at least once in our life.\nB) If you commit a crime you do time. Otherwise what incentive is there to not just go round doing what ever you want? If you want to use examples to plead you're case, here's some right back at you. Pedophiles, labeled and made public for people to protect their children. Same with rapists and other convicted criminals. While these might be extreme examples, so is \"Nazi Germany\". \nThere is even a law called the freedom of information of all things that should be made public are made public. While this is up to Riots discretion to do so it would obviously curb toxicity given that much like getting a criminal record in the real world, having marks or a \"banner\" against you're name should add incentive to be less toxic. Also, this shouldn't be a permanent thing. Possibly giving the \"toxic banner\" a time frame to wear off. Then that way when you are toxic you get a banner and get a taste of what it's like to have it then when it wears off you will be more inclined with a 2nd chance. \nC) How bout you come up with an idea yourself instead of just trashing on everyone else's ideas like you think you can do better. Or at least retort what you think wont work and then make a suggestion of how to improve it and why you're suggestion is more reasonable. But no we wont see that from you because you're just as toxic and bitter as the people who deserve banners. You add nothing to this conversation accept bad judgement and poor reasoning. At least this is creating a conversation for improvement but you coming in here banging on you're chest isn't really helpful.","replies":[{"poster":"Wast3land ","date":"2016-09-24T04:16:29.998+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"True, i'm not helping, if i had an idea i would post it, but the fact that i don't is a positive in itself. i see what you are trying to say and you make good points on that, but what this guy that made the post who wanted the \"Banner\" for toxic players is so he can dodge and not waste time with them. Lets take example you went to jail for something you did and you really would do anything to undo it, you go back home and everyone in your family hates you, so they abandon you because you did 1 really bad thing but you know you can change you you have been thinking about it. How would that make you feel. That's not right isn't it. You want a banner so you know when to dodge, that's just straight up selfish and non-sensical.
