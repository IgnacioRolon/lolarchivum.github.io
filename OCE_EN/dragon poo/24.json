That coupled with the people who say \"the reports are meaningless\" to bait people into not doing it tends to convince some people that the automated system doesn't do anything. Take a look on boards though and you'll see it does in fact work. \n\nBearing in mind of course that the majority of players who post about their punishments on boards are those that feel they were unjust. Most players who face punishments know exactly what they did wrong, and the vast majority never see a second punishment.\n\nIt's always frustrating to encounter a toxic player, especially if they are targeting you, but really the best advice we can give is to mute and report in post game. If they are acting out consistently they well face punishment for it, and if it was a once off then they at least have been flagged by the system in case they start doing it often.\n\nIt's also incredibly frustrating that there isn't more feedback to reporting players. Believe me this is my biggest pet peeve with the behaviour systems in place. The popup notifying you that someone you reported has been punished only shows up under very specific and very limited circumstances, so most players never see it. If you only reported things like severe hate speech you'd probably see it almost every report, but for the average player you'll almost never see it. This is indeed a failing of the system, however it doesn't mean that people aren't being punished, simply that players aren't being notified of it.","replies":[{"poster":"YellowBrickRoad","date":"2016-12-17T15:40:25.678+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Lemme explain to you why the people that are wrongfully banned on the boards is not proof the system works.\n\nBy comparing to the legal system.\n\njust because i catch 5 pedophiles, does not mean that i caught every pedophile in the world, or even half of them, or even 10% of them.\n\nit means i caught 5.\n\nNow imagine, if we had the ability to just know that someone might have committed a crime, but we decided that the best course of action was to let a computer decide if they are guilty.\n\nI mean the legal system is pretty broken, but if you put a computer in charge of making every decision instead of a judge and jury... my god the number of false imprisonments and people who get away scott free would skyrocket.\n\nbecause the computer doesnt feel, the computer cant read between the lines.\n\nThats why if i wanted to be toxic, id just send smiley faces all game to piss people off.\n\nSystem cant catch that.\n\nA human can though.","replies":[{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2016-12-17T16:01:06.923+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"First of all, the variety of behaviours involved in the criminal justice system is an incredible amount more than that which is seen in game, which largely follows predictable patterns of behaviour, which is precisely why an automated system is effective at catching the _majority_ of cases. It is not designed to catch all of them, rather it is designed to catch all the standard behaviours, so that Riot can focus on the niche cases that need more context to determine.\n\nCatching 5 pedophiles with 100% accuracy is still better than catching 5 pedophiles with 50% accuracy and rewarding the people that caught them regardless of accuracy, which is in essence the problem that tribunal had. It was accurate enough, and rewarded people for being salty/petty and witch hunt-y rather than voting for an objective punishment.\n\nIf you put a similar machine learning program in charge of say, petty theft cases then you would likely see an improvement, as it can take into account any history of crime and determine a punishment that fits the severity and the frequency of the crime in a fraction of the time the courts can, where the courts often don't have enough time to review cases properly, and end up putting petty thieves in jail for first time non violent offences.\n___\nThe system can in fact catching you spamming smiley faces, and if you get reported for it you will face punishment eventually. There was a very similar case on NA, where someone was spamming a GG macro (the one with all the | lined up) everytime someone died and got chat restricted for it very quickly.\n\nEven if you assume the system can't catch it, the number of report you would be receiving would tell the system that something isn't right, and it would pass your logs on for manual audit, which would then result in punishments.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"DarkShade918","date":"2016-12-25T04:50:33.152+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Your English should be bannable... lol","replies":[]},{"poster":"YellowBrickRoad","date":"2016-12-17T13:22:07.796+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"Look up the tribunal, its just another reason to hate riot games because they absolutely refuse to reenable peer moderated banning.","replies":[{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2016-12-17T15:19:52.654+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Banning _is_ peer moderated, Players decide what is and isn't ok by what they choose to report as a majority.","replies":[{"poster":"YellowBrickRoad","date":"2016-12-17T15:24:38.007+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Thats not peer moderated.\n\nthats peer submitted.\n\npeer moderation would mean the peers literally moderate the banning process.\n\n\nOur only input is nominations for bans which then go through an automatic system that just checks a bunch of flags and decides whether that constitutes a ban.\n\nA system which time and time again is proven to just not fucking work, because while it does ban SOME people, far more just go through the system unnoticed because they do things that arent accounted for in the variable check.\n\na real world example of this is that support singed.\n\nClearly he was getting hundreds of reports otherwise a rioter wouldnt have manually audited his account.\n\nBut the system didnt catch him.\n\nDo i think he was wrongly banned? yes.\n\nDo i think riot thinks he should be banned? yes.\n\nDo i think riots own fucking system didnt do what riot thinks it does? yes.\n\nBecause lets face it, if riot actually thinks he should be banned, then their automatic system would be looking for the things that got him banned, and if thats the case why did it have to come to a manual audit to actually get him banned?\n\nunless the system doesnt fucking work.\n\n\nive been playing league since open beta, so i actually have a point of reference where i can compare tribunal to non tribunal, because i was playing on na both during and post tribunal eras.\n\ni am walking fucking evidence, that the tribunal works, because i remember god damn clearly that the game was less toxic before the tribunal got canned.\n\ninfact i remember when they announced this automatic system, talking it up like its the holy grail, guess what, games more toxic than when that announcement happened as well.\n\nThe automatic system only appears to work, because the people that try to defend it, are all high elo.\n\nAnd the player pool in high elo is significantly smaller, so if you ban one troll out of a player base of a few thousand people, guess what, you just banned a significant portion of them.\n\nDo that same thing in lower elos, where the toxicity problem still exists, and you didnt scratch the surface.","replies":[{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2016-12-17T15:52:51.284+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"If it isn't reported, it isn't punished, therefore the act of submitting a report is saying \"I think this is punishment worthy\" and therefore constitutes moderation (even if it isn't as direct as you would like). Manual bans are done frequently but compared to the automatic system it is a rather small percentage. \n\nWith that many cases reviewed and punishments handled how many false cases have you seen? I've seen one on OCE boards and two through the NA volunteers and all 3 were resolved within a week through support as is the norm. A false punishment will ALWAYS be reversed.\n\nThe Singed support case is not nearly so simple. The system didn't pick him up because it was a niche case, which are passed on for manual audits. It is a case that Riot would have been monitoring for a while given the number of reports he was receiving. It wasn't until he'd wracked up a significant number that Riot decided to take action which is when it hit the spotlight. When he was punished does not equal when he was noticed.\n\nDo I think he was wrongly banned? No. I have discussed this extensively in other posts so I will not repeat my reasoning here.\n\nDo I think Riot wanted to ban him? Yes, but temporarily. I do not believe the threat of perma was warranted and also believe it was largely due to miscommunication within support rather than any real danger of being perma banned.\n\nDo I think Riot's system works? Yes.\nDoes it pick up niche cases? No, but that's what the manual audits are for. Is it perfect? No, but it does far better than tribunal ever did, in terms of accuracy, reform rates, and overall approval of punishments by the community.\n\nSupport Singed is so niche it basically never happens, which is precisely why the automated system can't see him. The automated system is a machine learning system, i.e it requires previous cases to understand if a player needs a punishment or not. Since it didn't have enough history to evaluate the Singed, it didn't, and simply flagged it for manual review.\n\nExpecting the automated system to be able to accurately punish the support Singed is like asking a kid who's seen a car once to drive it for you. It just doesn't work that way.\n\nIn case you were unaware, high elo is WAY more toxic than bronze, and due to the high saturation of smurfs, it's hard to actually permanently ban a player. High elo is where witch hunting is at its worst. Get on someone's bad side and they'll be queue sniping you and trolling you until they run out of accounts or get over themselves enough to leave you be.\n\nThe people who defend the system are those who see it working. Who look at all sides (those getting banned that should be, those getting banned that shouldn't, those not getting banned that should be and those not getting banned that shouldn't) and decide that there is sufficient evidence for them to conclude it works. \n\nClearly you are one of the people that don't believe there is sufficient evidence, and that is the biggest reason why I want more stats form the punishment systems, but Riot has it's issues with transparency like any other company. They do a lot better than most.\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Negativity_bias","replies":[{"poster":"YellowBrickRoad","date":"2016-12-17T16:25:41.713+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Actually im one of those people who deal with toxic players literally every day.\n\ni dont think the system doesnt work, because i dont see the list of banned people.\n\ni dont think the system works, because the vast majority of people in my elo, should be banned.\n\nlike just straight up atleast 60% of them would be banned by now on a tribunal system, they are that toxic.\n\nmy elo, is so toxic, when i see someone that is legitimately nice, my first thought is they are being sarcastic.\n\nThats the state of the game for the vast majority of players, because outside of gold elo and up, where the playerbase is so small that you can actually catch most people with an automated system, silver and bronze? are still a breeding ground for it.\n\nHell im guilty of being toxic, ive afk'd and inted maybe a couple hundred games out of sheer frustration and rage at my team.\n\nSo i know first hand the system doesnt fucking work because id be banned.\n\nAnd even then if the system did work i wouldnt be toxic, because i wouldnt deal with it literally every second fucking game.\n\nlike i dont know about you but in other games with active communities, i dont get this kind of shit, infact league of legends is a fucking laughing stock to every other game community.\n\nits a meme that our community is cancer.\n\nThey rank our regions based on how cancer they are, not how good they are.\n\nLike fuck take another game i play world of warcraft, pretty comparable size to league of legends.\n\nGuess how long it takes me to get a 4 day ban from world of warcraft for saying something offensive in chat?\n\n2 hours.\n\nThey dont even use an automatic system, its all people, and i have never once needed to dispute a ban from blizzard because its people, so if i get banned, i deserved it.\n\nThe only truly accurate banning system is one that involves humans making the decisions, and the tribunal? well there was a reason that riot was applauded for the tribunal system.\n\nit wasnt because innovative, its because it worked.\n\nit used the sheer manpower of the playerbase to moderate their playerbase, thats why it was appluaded.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]}
