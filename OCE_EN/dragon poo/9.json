I couldn&#039;t deal with what abilities were what and having to recast the damn w to actually launch someone somewhere. \r\n\r\nI feel that her kit is muddled and clunky, mainly due to her w and e being in the wrong spots and having to recast the w to actually launch someone. if you have it on quick cast shouldn&#039;t it really be quick cast? similar to viktor&#039;s death ray? and her e, why does it have a cast time and why can&#039;t you cast it while casting the w, that would make for a hard and easily readable skillshot to actually be punishable if you hit it?   anyway, what are your guys thought on her?","replies":[{"poster":"Talon12","date":"2016-05-26T02:24:40.752+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Taliyah\n\nshe getting reasonable buffs, but its all on her q.\n\ncd smaller, cost lower and 50% increased damage to minions ","replies":[]},{"poster":"BrotherCaine","date":"2016-05-26T01:47:19.378+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"1) You have to get quite close to do her thing like Cassiopia (at least cass has an ult to throw out to stop retaliation).

So good its a slight obstacle for her to receive major buffs, perhaps.\n\n3) Too reliant on Rylias. Wow. You feel like there are two phases of the game - before and after you get this item.
