There is no way to communicate other than pings, i cant tell them to wait till I&#039;ve done blue to go in, or any other basic thing. its frustrating and depressing when you get beaten by a team who is playing better than your laners and can communicate too.  either make the ping system more diverse or have language barriers in place.","replies":[]}
