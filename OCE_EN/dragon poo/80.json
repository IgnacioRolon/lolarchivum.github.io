Not sure why Riot haven't bothered to fix it yet. Basically, what happens is that the patcher checks your folders using some sort of thing from their servers, and it fails to ping back what information it retrieves from your computer, thus meaning the patcher no longer knows what it needs to download and then gives up on life.\n\nA quick fix: Navigate to \"C:\\Riot Games\\League of Legends\\RADS\\projects\\lol_game_client\" and delete the \"filearchives\" folder.\n\nAnother possible solution is to place a blank file named \"S_OK\" in the latest version folder inside \"C:\\Riot Games\\League of Legends\\RADS\\projects\\lol_air_client\\releases\\\", but I'm not too sure about the validity of it.\n\nAll paths presume default installation location.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Slinkzy","date":"2015-04-08T20:53:18.290+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"This always happens to me when i try update at work using my 4g phone network. Normally I just wait to get home and patch... Which sucks balls.\n\nAll you need to do is change your internet connection. A mates house or something like this. OR Delete your lol_air_client project folder located at: C:\\Riot Games\\League of Legends\\RADS\\projects\\lol_air_client\\ After you delete it you will need to patch again. Keep in mind that the client will download everything that was in that folder and it will be around 1 gig in Downloads. This folder also contains your custom item sets so make sure you set em up again if you were using any. ^.^ Good luck","replies":[{"poster":"dragon poo","date":"2015-04-08T21:01:17.581+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"thanks heaps ill give it a shot, my partner and i are currently running off a mobile hotspot because we cant afford the net, but data workout has saved us for now XD ill get back to you asap, thanks for the speedy reply!","replies":[]}]}]}
