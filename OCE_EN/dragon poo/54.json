So, for example, we look at Annie mid differently to Annie support. We take a series of performance metrics and compare how you do to all other players in your region in your champion / position combination. It is percentile driven - so earning a high score means** you performed in the top x% of players** on that champ in that position. The grade itself governs the point gains.\n\n[(Source)](http://na.leagueoflegends.com/en/page/features/champion-mastery)\n\n[Basically grades similarly to a bell curve](http://study.com/academy/lesson/bell-curve-definition-impact-on-grades.html), meaning we have a server full of really good players.","replies":[{"poster":"dragon poo","date":"2016-09-16T11:57:18.572+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Still, I'm pretty sure 97% KP within 30 min is pretty top notch.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Łæoña","date":"2016-09-16T10:47:56.682+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Theres been an update where for support they pretty much weigh your assists as 'kills'.
