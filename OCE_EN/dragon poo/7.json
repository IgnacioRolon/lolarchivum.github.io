Riot please hear me out, if I cant do anything about it, then why do i have an hour of my time banned? and of course the arbitrary &quot;why is it not just 2 or three day ban&quot; question, becausei honestly can not understand why its a five game ban. thanks if it is resolved. I&#039;d give a better insight into my life but you probably wont want to hear it. &lt;3 keep up the good work guys.","replies":[{"poster":"ƒamous","date":"2015-09-27T03:40:11.215+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"Someone said this on another thread talking about this issue, you agree to the EULA and TOU that you have a sufficient internet connection that's stable and able to support the game. It's your responsibility, not Riot's, therefore theres nothing they can do.

If you're constantly leaving work early or coming late, even if they are valid reasons, you're going to get fired. 20 minute low priority queue means either you have, left games before in the past or the internet has cut out multiple times. \n\nAFKing makes the game unfair for everyone, and it is not an acceptable way to handle harassment in-game. We have mute buttons on every player, I recommend you use these in the future. \n\nAs for technical issues you might be having, you should make sure to play under the best conditions possible. I know this isn't always achievable and stuff happens, but you just have to accept this as a consequence of bad internet.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Klavinmour","date":"2015-09-26T18:34:10.907+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"You don't get low priority for a single incident.

But these incidents are months apart, im trying my best to control my anger, and if i have to leave the game to stop being abused because im not a great mid laner, or because i made a bad play, then i will leave games, ivenever left a ranked game and hate when people leave games for no reason, but if i cant even give a reason to my team before i afk, then im sorry that my net is a piece of gak. I'll be so happy when nbn is rolled out.","replies":[]}]}
