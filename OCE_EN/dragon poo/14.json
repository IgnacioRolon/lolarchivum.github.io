For a direct quote from the league of legends wiki this is the description for his ult:\n\n> PASSIVE: Olaf gains bonus armor and bonus magic resistance while Ragnarok is inactive.\n> ACTIVE: Olaf removes all disables from himself and becomes immune to them for the next 6 seconds, gaining bonus attack damage for the duration. For the first second of Ragnarok, he also gains bonus movement speed when moving towards nearby visible enemy champions.\n\nWith this in mind his ult lasts for 6 seconds which can be a very long time but when he does ult he loses the bonus Armor and Magic Resist he gains from his passive. Explain to your team that when Olaf ults you need everyone to focus him and burst him down. In the state of a team fight when the Olaf starts ulting and charging for your back line, ping him a few times for your team to focus him. This is the simple way to go about it and often the most effective way but there is more that you can do to help your AD.\n\nAs an Alistar you have a very big hitbox for when people click on you and this can be used to your advantage. If you find yourself in the situation where an Olaf is ulting and running for your AD, try to stand on top of your AD Carry effectively trying to make it so they cannot be clicked on. You might not be able to block the entire hitbox but you might be able to tank Olaf's E (Reckless Swing) from hitting your AD with it hitting you instead.\n\nAnother thing to consider is items that you can buy, though it might not sound directly beneficial picking up a Locket of the Iron Solari while the passive might not help against the Olaf the active certainly will. Giving your AD a buffer of health to survive just a bit longer. At the same time you might also want to consider picking up a Mikael's Crucible. This will help to not only give your AD that extra buffer of health, but it also removes certain forms of crowd control. Say you are in the situation where your AD gets tag'd by one of Olaf's Axes you can remove the slow that was placed on them giving them a chance to dodge the next in coming one. Talisman of Ascension can also be an item to consider picking up, the movement speed will allow your AD to juke axes easier and run away from the Olaf for a longer period of time.\n\nThere might be a bit of a debate between either picking up a Talisman of Ascension or Face of the Mountain for dealing with Olaf and it really depends as to what you hope to gain out of the item for dealing with him. If your AD is strong enough to the point where damage alone they can kite the Olaf Face of the Mountain is probably the better pick up. Whereas on the other side of things if your AD would find it more valuable to straight up run away until the Olaf's ult runs out then Talisman of Ascension is your better pick up.\n\nSo for reference these are the key items that I would recommend that you consider picking up in the case of vsing an Olaf for dealing with him in team fights:\n{{item:3190}} {{item:3069}} {{item:3401}} {{item:3222}} \n\nAll of this information is to help you stall for time while he uses his ult. Make sure especially as an Alistar but this also applies to other supports that you save your CC abilities that you have until after his ult duration ends or before he has used them. \n\nI hope this information that I have given helps you and if you have any questions let me know! The main thing to keep in mind is always try to communicate to your team as to when you need more than just yourself as a support to peel for your main damage sources in the back line. Good luck out there mate!\n\n~ Elam","replies":[{"poster":"dragon poo","date":"2016-10-29T11:20:35.042+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=LGC Elam,realm=OCE,application-id=FjGAIbRv,discussion-id=e2PgsZ8j,comment-id=0001,timestamp=2016-10-28T12:20:10.762+0000)\n>\n> When you are looking to peel for your ADC against an Olaf it is very important to understand how his ult works.

Good luck out there mate!\n> \n> ~ Elam\n\nthanks for the info, funiily enough im pretty sure i had locket and fotm but they also had a karma, and the olaf had a ms buff item, so there was about half a second of time before he was on the addc from half the lane away. all in all  that help was nice thank you.","replies":[{"poster":"Nightjar","date":"2016-10-29T12:12:35.174+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"other options involve exhausting olaf to reduce his damage output and his tankiness and a frozen heart to reduce his atk speed and again reducing his damage output. Olaf's whole gimmick is the cc immunity and he basically forces the enemy team to reposition to deal with him without being extended enough to begin a teamfight and to basically focus him down. The goal is to burst him down before he kills the backline so frozen heart and exhaust will help alot in bringing olaf down before he does any serious damage. Ignite can also stop him from lifestealing  if you are worried you can't focus him down fast enough and a michaels will make it harder for him to catch your backline squishies.\n\nIn games Olaf generally will at least burn alot of cds and ults to bring him down, but on the flipside he's rather weak to poke and dive comps since he also can't really protect his carries and so having a number of bruisers or mobile duelists can also be an option against olaf. If Olaf builds tanky, you may want to try to look to be the aggressors in a teamfight rather than focus on protecting your backline as much and go for a much more rapid teamfight and then deal with him after. if he goes more damage oriented build, frozen heart, locket and exhaust and a strong formation can also shut him down pretty quickly.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Roguestoney","date":"2016-10-28T11:53:47.115+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Your team needs to poke Olaf down so he cant just run up to your ADC.","replies":[]}]}
