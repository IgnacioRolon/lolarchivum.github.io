It captures your exact screen and optionally your camera and mic too\n\nIf you're a player wanting to improve from every game, go with LSI, it records your matches in spectator form and gives you statistics and your average ability.\n\nIf you're a player that wants to show the world that you're the play maker, go with replay.gg.
