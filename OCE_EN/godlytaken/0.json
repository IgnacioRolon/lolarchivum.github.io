I like to play to win and to have fun, and muting is an option, but that removes the ability to communicate with the team. (usually the salt is between 2 other players, but I dislike that too).\r\n\r\nSo if they aren&#039;t willing to communicate and behave i usually just leave game. Fun &gt; Rank (plus likely going to lose anyways if people are salty).\r\n\r\nIs there a way to prove your willingness to leave a game in-game? or do they just have to take your word for it?\r\n\r\nI think I&#039;m currently level 2 leaver, and I want to prove it. How to?","replies":[{"poster":"Tele","date":"2017-06-11T23:39:34.276+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey there,\n\nRiot actually has a handy feature for this.
