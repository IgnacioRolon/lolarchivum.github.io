So frustrating a game thats been out this long has stupid stuff like this.\r\n\r\nWhat its regarding is the fact i have no compensation for the runes i paid for with all the years i did play. my account is 8 years old plus \r\nI talked to friends who did get compensated, I am supprised this was not addressed at the change over.","replies":[{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2018-06-25T09:12:13.204+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The compensation for runes and pages was tied to a limited (but long) time mission.

Log out of the website **from the support page**, and then follow the process as normal, pressing login when prompted.\n> \n> If your support page has the blank &quot;OC&quot; login in the top right, you&#x27;re good to go. If it only has your summoner icon with &quot;OCEANIA&quot; it means the support page is seeing you as logged in on the website and not in support. You need to follow one of the steps above.\n\nJust curious, but did you attempt to contact support after the change-over about the lack of compensation? If you hadn't, it's not exactly surprising that nothing happened. Fact is, they can't solve a problem they don't know exists.","replies":[{"poster":"Swampdonkey34","date":"2018-06-24T23:52:36.645+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yep you were right thank you for taking the time and helping me i had to log out of the AUS website and go incog and sign in that way to make a ticket. thank you so much.\n","replies":[]}]}]}
