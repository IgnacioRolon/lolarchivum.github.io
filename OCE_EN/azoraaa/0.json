Sometimes this means healing the tank so they can peel for you for a few extra seconds.\n\nIf you think someone is going to all in you (with ignite) Heal earlier so the ignite doesn't reduce the heal amount.\n\nI personally almost never heal unless im below half health and I'm also not a fan of healing aggressively (to get the speed boost in order to catch someone).","replies":[]}]}
