Anyway if anyone has advice on how to use a lead efficiently and how to not get caught out it would be much appreciated :D   -Thanks Azora","replies":[{"poster":"Captain Fortune","date":"2016-04-02T13:17:48.402+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"There is a general rule of thumb that I would recommend you follow after laning phase. Look at the side lanes and see how the minion waves look. If they are not past river go push it until it is and then rotate to be with your team. This rule of thumb will be different if you are ahead or behind though along with where the enemy team is. Try to stick with your team if you are unsure what to do. Take advantage of the fact that you have a chat box and try to communicate with your team to keep them focused on what they need to be doing, such as pushing for an objective or forcing a dragon or baron.\n\nYou will find though that some people won't listen to you. There are some things you can do to help this though. By talking in chat and asking things to get your team talking will help. One thing I highly suggest you do is talk in chat with your support about how they want to play the lane. Aggressively or passively, poke or sustaining etc. Talk to your jungler, ask what his plan is, who he plans to gank, kill two birds with one stone and have a plan going with your team before the game even starts. Small things like this will get your team chatting ahead of time and create a positive environment for your team. This also when your the one to start off the positive chatting will make you into a shot caller of sorts and you will find it is a ton easier to get people to listen to you when you have already done these steps to set it up.\n\nAs for how to prevent yourself from getting caught out late game. Make sure you are swapping to blue trinket and buying pink wards if you have the chance to. Coordinate with your team to place wards around where you are rotating. If you are pushing bot lane as a team towards their base, get your team to ward around their bottom jungle. You are pushing top lane as a team towards their base get your team to ward their top side jungle. This also applies for when you are playing defensively as well. Make sure you can when it is safe and don't get caught by warding, ward up parts around where their team is pushing.\n\nThe next thing you want to focus on is your team fighting. Learn to position well and how to team fight. Tell your team if you are going to need peel or if you want them diving for the enemy ADC. Also be sure to write down summoner spell timers. Some basic rules of thumb are flash is 5 minutes and heal is 4. This are some of the main cooldowns you want to keep track of. Of course quite a lot of these will be blown in fights, and you won't be able to remember all of them. A quick tip is early to mid game or if you get a chance late when team fighting. If you see a summoner spell blown that you want to keep track of, put a dot in chat like \".\" When the fight is over, if you have time stamps on you can look back to when that dot was and add the time of how long the summoner spell is with maths.\n\nAs for how to team fight itself I would recommend watching some the videos by unswlolsc his video on how to team fight mainly from an AD Carries point of view [can be found here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwE9wPwHCuU). This will teach you pretty much everything I want to say in more detail and will be easy to refer back to. On his channel you will also find videos around how to snowball harder out of laning phase and how to take advantage of things such as the cooldown on enemy champion's auto attacks.\n\n**Unrelated notes that I would recommend that might help you climb**\n\nI'm stealing this point a bit from Princess Yaia but I highly agree with what they say by starting a ranked journal. After every game write down at least one thing that you did wrong. Then depending on how much you play, set an amount of time maybe a week that you will go back and look over your notes. Find the most common mistake that you made. Then until the next review focus on making sure that one thing doesn't happen.\n\nThe last thing I would recommend is keep it simple. You want to focus on building your mechanics so keep your champion pool small so that you can auto pilot. Auto Piloting means that when you play instead of focusing on the mechanics of the champion itself you can naturally play them without really thinking. You can then use that extra brain power to focus on improving your play because you don't have to think about the basics of what you are doing. Examples of mechanics like this are CSing, positioning, team fighting and playing during laning phase. (These are just examples these are more.) \n\n**Final Notes/wrap up**\n\nAll in all I hope you learned from this wall of text and I apologize for how long it was! The main thing to do is to keep playing and keep your head high ^^\n\nIf you have any questions let me know I'll be sure to answer them and if you need any further clarity on what I have said feel free to ask that as well.\n\n~Roxil","replies":[{"poster":"Azoraaa","date":"2016-04-03T00:10:30.169+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You're a legend. i will be sure to add this all to my gameplay and hopefully i will be climbing in no time. thanks again -Azora","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Statikin","date":"2016-04-07T12:54:03.507+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"A bit unrelated to your specific problem, but while I am B5 ( sad ikr), I have found myself to be winning a lot more games recently because I am doing this one, pretty simple thing. I was always angry when I get a team that never communicates besides from pings and the occasional flame in chat, and that used to happen quite often. I've found, that while ur playing Ranked, if u see a player, enemy or ally, just seeming to enjoy themselves, are doing pretty well KDA wise and making fun at everything just add them as your friend, won't hurt, and will benefit you a lot, especially if they like to queue in ranked. They will likely be more communicative, fun to play with and more skilful than if you were to just queue up normally. And try to have the same joyous mindset them have while playing, it really does help, and once you've got that down, your problem you stated might slowly disappearing, especially if you are having more fun. Your friend may also help pick up on your mistakes. I've been doing this for a few weeks now, and my win/lose ratio is drastically changed in favour of winning. :D\n\nSo this wasn't really specific to your problem, but I hope this helps anyway!","replies":[]}]}
