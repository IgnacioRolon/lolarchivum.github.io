They do this almost every game, never say gg always along the lines of:\n\n\"RIP only won because you have broken ass Malphite, or Teemo, and they should be banned on ARAM\" \n\nWhen I on the otherhand feel as though it was the opposing teams superior skill and callouts which won them the game. \nThey do this in other games as well, but mostly Overwatch or League of Legends, they can't seem to handle that maybe the enemy team was better, but \"gg Riot, giving enemy team Veigar and Malphite, guaranteed win\" is their point of view.\n\nIs it right to report him for this?\nAs he always blames RNG or other people for losses and not himself in anyway shape or form.\n\nCheers for Response","replies":[{"poster":"Project Xayah","date":"2019-12-31T00:17:08.882+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":1,"body":"Ultimately, any behaviour you find unacceptable is what you should be reporting. It may not always be actioned, but one of the functions of the report system is to act as a feedback source for Riot on what people think should be punished, even if it's something that's not currently punished.\n\nSo far as the actual behaviour in question, I'd say it's reasonably possible that it might result in a chat restriction with enough consistency (i.e. if it's happening in all/most games) and is being reported, so it may provide a good \"wake up call\" to your relative, at the very least to say that the behaviour isn't acceptable in-game and they need to stop.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2019-12-31T09:53:15.497+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Xayah covered the official side of things, so I'll just comment on the behaviour side.\n\nBlaming the champion for their loss rather than accepting that sometimes (in fact roughly 50% of the time) the enemy player will just be better, is basically *the* classic example of deflection in League.\n\nIf you think about it, you probably see this behaviour elsewhere in their interactions outside of League, but essentially it's a defence mechanism. Nobody likes to admit they are wrong, and in a game like League with so many different variables that go into a match-up, blaming luck or some other uncontrollable is the easy way out. \n\nThe number of variables involved in the League environment means it's easy to justify and therefore reinforce that impulse in this environment, so the behaviour continues. ARAM especially is going to reinforce it, because there *is* a significant (though generally not *game-defining*) degree of luck involved right from the start.\n\nIt's a pretty unhealthy behaviour, but for the most part, will only hurt them (refusing to admit mistakes basically dooms you to repeat them). Depending on your relationship with them, it may be something you want to address with them, or may not.\n\nHow you address it largely depends on the person, but logic generally isn't the way to go. You could calmly reason all you want, but if they were taking a logical/reasonable approach they wouldn't be deflecting so hard in the first place.","replies":[]},{"poster":"LoyalMan","date":"2019-12-31T02:19:57.564+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":3,"body":"lowkey pathetic for you to report just because he blames rng.

Depending on the circumstance it may or may not be our (OPs in this case) responsibility to *address* the behaviour, but we certainly also have no obligation to expose ourselves to it.\n\nThe idea of calling someone pathetic for not wanting to put up with other people's unpleasantness is wildly unfair to me.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Zadel","date":"2019-12-31T17:33:24.405+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"like i mentioned, \"is it right for me to report them\" im just looking for mostly yes or no, but constructive criticism is welcome","replies":[]}]}]}
