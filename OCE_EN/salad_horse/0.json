But whatever you are doing to the servers Riot is causing me to have a steady 500 ping. Why are you changing it? You know the saying &quot;if it aint broke dont fix it&quot; i guess this kinda applies here. Fair enough if you are trying to make a better experience for us but honestly as an OCE player i feel neglected by Riot. I feel neglected because the communication to us players is really bad. For example, the server skin (It is incredible btw nice job on it) was a mess, the reef thing that you are going do, i have no idea what is going on with that and now this, this &#039;network shift&#039;. I would of love to known about this before i hopped onto a game. \r\nLook i think what you do is amazing and i love your work as a video game studio, but please communicate with us and let us know things as they are going to happen, not when they do happen.","replies":[{"poster":"Talon12","date":"2015-11-06T23:02:05.970+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"its all fixed now","replies":[]},{"poster":"TheFedoraMaster","date":"2015-11-06T22:27:11.131+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey you are no my friends list Daniel :D","replies":[]},{"poster":"Tele","date":"2015-11-06T20:29:08.542+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hold tight, it's probably because of [this](http://boards.oce.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/announcements/yLWijwsJ-connection-issues-6th-november-2015-updated-1015pm-aedt).","replies":[]}]}
