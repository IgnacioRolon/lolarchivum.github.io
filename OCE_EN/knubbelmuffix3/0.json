And the worst thing is that the lowlife scum who programmed them is to dumb to give them any sort of AI.\r\n\r\nHere&#039;s a hint to botusers: if you fail to make a functioning bot then you literally fail at life. \r\n\r\nAlso fuck Riot&#039;s Deathball bots that just run down mid in a group of 5 after they&#039;ve been fed to shit.","replies":[{"poster":"Nightjar","date":"2017-03-14T03:45:44.377+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"my opinion on this matter is: \n\n- don't pick janna or hard supportive type supports in a coop game, it doesn't teach you anything for those types of champions and it makes carrying the possible 1v9 alot harder,\n\n- you only need a maximum of two human players to actually win, anything more is overkill, a duo for leveling up guarantees 100% win rate.\n\n- you can also win 1v5 the bots in a teamfight if you aren't a completely new player to the moba genre (this is easiest when picking an adc, but can be done with practically any champion that does damage or can build full ad or ap or some damage over time tanks),\n\n- buy snowbally items like ghostblade, mejais, ludens, mobiboots, static shiv,\n\n- bots are stupid and will back in dumb places, this makes carrying much cheaper and less difficult, whilst we are on the matter of cheap tricks for bot games that won't work in regular games, the bots don't have a jungler, so after your first back, some jungle camps are some really easy and nice xp and buffs inbetween roaming.\n\n- most of riots bots don't fight back once they're below around 10% hp, exceptions to this are ammumu, alistair, nami and wukong (sometimes),\n\n- bots are very good at wombo comboing, buy a mercurial scimitar/edge of night for teamfights or don't stand near malphite unless you have flash, banshees or can afford to get knocked up and then fight.\n\n- bots are bad at dealing with banner and zzrot push, place these in sidelanes as a bit of insurance if you think you might die. Splitpushing also works quite well and is why tp is generally one of the best summoner spells to take into a botgame.\n\n- bots aren't good at queueing up abilities after items like zhonias or guardian angel, so they're pretty useful pickups, noteworthy exception of nami bot. Nobody likes nami bot.\n\n- riot doesn't care about people using bots to level up accounts and will ignore them, so try to get good enough to fight the 1v9 if needed, it's actually pretty nice if you want to practice playing say riven, katarina, diana or yasou in a 1v5 low elo 'teamfight' situation where your teammates will be off in sidelanes getting executed by towers or minions.\n\n- try to start filling out a rune page and take keystones that are strong early like thunderlords to get ahead faster so that you can carry the player made trash bots.","replies":[{"poster":"KnubbelMuffix3","date":"2017-03-14T03:47:59.172+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"botgames are there to test out new champs, have fun trying to 1v9 unless you actually play seriously.

Bot games aren't hard, you just need to know what you can exploit and build and play around the fact that you, as a human, are far superior to a bot. Also build full damage and pick up the cheesy kills where possible.","replies":[{"poster":"KnubbelMuffix3","date":"2017-03-14T04:37:11.186+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"have you actually played an intermediate botgame where every lane was filled with botplayers? They will group up as 5 in mid and just run it down being at least as fed as you but having 5 times the CC. Nothing without range can kill em U'll have 1 bot in each lane feeding his ass off, I was testing an azir jungle build and there was nothing I could do against a fed akali jumping to me and basically 1shotting me at lvl 9 while I barely finished 2 items.","replies":[{"poster":"Nightjar","date":"2017-03-14T05:40:35.925+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yes I have played quite a few intermediate bot games leveling up a few alts, mostly for use during holidays overseas.\n\nMost of the time, to 1v9 a coop, start top or bot depending on the enemy bots that you'll face in each lane, pick the easier lane. then you freeze the minion wave outside tower, farm up, hit lvl3, ignore allied feeder bots, don't waste summoners like heal or flash to try to save them, kill both the enemy bots once you hit lvl3-6 depending on your powerspikes and the matchup, farm a little till they get back, trade hard till they're forced to back again, maybe kill them if possible if you can reach the spot where the bots back just behind tower, but usually just also back. Buy a mejais or some lethality, come back to lane, focus on keeping the enemy bots at around 20-30% hp whilst freezing, once they're sufficiently over extended, engage and kill them before they can run back to tower, set the minion wave to push, rotate to another lane, kill any bots in that lane, set the lane to push, rotate to the next lane, taking a buff, kill the bots, set the wave to push and get some farm. Recall, buy items, tp back to the first lane, and rinse and repeat the kill, push, rotate cycles. Try to force a tower in a lane, since this brings more bots to this lane and the bots tend to push less in a lane with less towers, rotate and take a tower elsewhere. At this point the enemy bots would have grouped up and then you just slaughter them with your snowball.\n\nProblems, azir is underpowered and extremely hard to play well, still with his range and defensive self peel, he's still good for the 1v9 teamfight. You decided jungle, I forgot to mention this but it's much harder to 1v9 carry without securing a lane ( a lane where you'll get first tower blood and map pressure early on and also stop the enemy bots from getting fed so you only have to face 3-4 fed enemies rather than 5) from the start and it's harder to clear jungle prelvl30 because you won't have many runes and you won't have a leash which makes starting a snowball a whole lot harder, because you'll be starting very slowly. Azir also has a weak earlygame, no sustain or healing, he's squishy and no damage reduction, so jungling without runes is going to be very difficult. Also jungling requires some levels of team coordination, which well only works with multiple humans ingame, if you have 4 bots on your team, ganks just won't work out in most cases.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Roguestoney","date":"2017-03-13T23:59:28.141+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"K.","replies":[]}]}
