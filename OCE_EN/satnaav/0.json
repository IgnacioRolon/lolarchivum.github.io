Level ups take too long and the rewards insignificant. I got less BE on a champion capsules than i did on a regular capsule. \r\n\r\nI have no incentive to play more than 1 game everyday. Never cared for paragon leveling. At least before i got something tangible after every game.\r\n\r\nThis is like any other game I&#039;ve played with daily quests.....
