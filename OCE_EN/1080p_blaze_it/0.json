It has come to my conclusion that Riot refuse to put **URF** in the rotation for the weekly game modes more often than not and it really makes my **blood boil**. I am calling all brothers and sisters that **HATE** most of the game modes in this rotation other than, Ascension and Hexakill and similar modes. \r\n\r\nHelp raise awareness of the poor game time that **URF** gets, the one and only game mode on the rotation that i can play hours on end without getting bored. PLEASE Riot make this game mode appear in the game mode rotation more than it does at this point and time.\r\n\r\nI mean, who even likes Nexus Siege or One for All etc.  I am hoping i am not the only one that thinks this besides my friend group that i play with, because i would be very upset. I hope that anyone who agrees with me is to **GET THE MESSAGE OUT THERE.\r\n**\r\nKind regards, 1080p Blaze It. {{champion:77}}","replies":[{"poster":"idc","date":"2016-09-02T10:07:24.687+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It's returning in the next couple of weeks.
