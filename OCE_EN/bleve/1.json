But that is not a reason for some one dt hear other's words, while they do a fault decision. AND THOSE PEOPLE WHO WANT TO BLAME ME, come on first u need solo me show me ur better. Then u need to understand!!! I AM NOT BLAME TEAMMATE, I JUST COMPLAIN THOSE PEOPLE PLAY SO BAD AT SAME TIME DT HEAR OTHERS WORDS. PLZ, be clear of my mean. \nAND I am looking for some one really skillful, come and solo me, see if u are skillful enough.

This is also the main reason you have come and posted this looking for duo ad, as clarified by your specific \"someone with good awareness & knows what to do but still plat-gold-silver\"\n\nTruth is, winning lane means nothing as league is now gearing up to truly being a team game. Objectives such as dragon, RH, baron and towers take precedence over things like kills (something you are priding yourself on). Your KDA is less than 2 for 4/5 of your ranked games so far. \n\nIf it really is your team fight that is letting you down and preventing you from being good, maybe you should stop playing assassins, and focus on champs with high levels of CC or utility. You can easily roam more, to help your other lanes get ahead (if you are winning your lane as you say, you should be doing this anyway), and help secure objectives. I see you ward a lot, but where do you ward? - These are the kind of things you need to be thinking about.\n\nEdit- Nice, you changed your ad.","replies":[{"poster":"Bleve","date":"2016-02-11T08:07:19.818+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yeah I also know that I still got a lot of things to do. But I just think, it is not fair to me. \nIf u can try think when u doing all things good, but ur teammate just like i say doing so bad. And finally u lose game, and u try hard to tell them no to do that. If u can understand that, u will know why i have to find a duo.\nLOL is not one person's game, it is a team work game, u must know it well, aren't you?\nAnd i dt think KDA can provide everything, i dt like rip other's kill. I prefer everyone got enough money, because we are team.  You want KDA can check my normal game, i do got a lot because it is normal. I have already play one for ur want to see kda, i rip jg's kill","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Combilizer","date":"2016-02-14T12:08:18.256+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Add me in game, I'll duo. \n\nHowever, wo shuo de bu hao :)\n\nRNG best )))))))","replies":[]},{"poster":"ashen sami","date":"2016-02-14T03:09:25.453+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"hi\ni would also like this","replies":[]},{"poster":"Ungnyeo","date":"2016-02-11T16:49:32.797+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"keen","replies":[]},{"poster":"GigaPube","date":"2016-02-11T09:18:58.065+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"gee you sound nice, im sure lots of people would love to play with you kappa","replies":[]},{"poster":"Lord Kylar Alice","date":"2016-02-11T07:33:12.876+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"**boom**","replies":[]}]}
