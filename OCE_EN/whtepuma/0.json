I'm an extremely good Ashe. But I'm afraid you misunderstand why she gets picked. Any AD Carry can kite. Any AD Carry can slow if you get the likes of Frozen Mallet or Red Buff. Ashe is picked for her Engage potential and is quite strong in lane phase because of it. Vayne is picked because she scales into a hypercarry and (as a tradeoff) is quite weak in lane phase because of it. They're very different AD Carries that should be picked in very different conditions.\n\nI mean, your entire list save for Ashe are sitting in the 'meh tier' right now. As much as I used to love him, I wouldn't pick Ezreal in a Ranked game if my life depended on it. I have not seen an Ezreal win a game as an AD Carry in the AD Carry role in quite a while. The closest substitute for Ezreal that is decent right now would be Lucian or perhaps Graves to an extent.\n\nEDIT: And when you say 'mid engagement', do you mean engaging in the mid lane (i.e. teamfights), or mid game? Because, again, that's two very different things because picking Ashe you have great mid game teamfight potential, and picking Vayne you actually sacrifice your potential to teamfight to a vast degree.","replies":[{"poster":"WhtePuma","date":"2015-02-20T06:19:37.404+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Every single champion in the game is pretty much balanced and has their kit that can have a positive combination with the rest of the team or a negative one.\n\nThey have different kits but a lot of them can be varied based on the build.\n\nEDIT: mid engagement as in half way through an engagement....","replies":[{"poster":"CIoudz","date":"2015-02-20T06:21:29.513+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":0,"body":"\"Every single champion in the game is pretty much balanced\" \n\n I have no idea what game  you're playing but it  can't be League of legends","replies":[{"poster":"Nestay","date":"2015-02-20T08:05:15.587+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=CIoudz,realm=OCE,application-id=mR0UmRrp,discussion-id=ABZ7sLfu,comment-id=0000000000000000000000000000,timestamp=2015-02-20T06:21:29.513+0000)\n>\n> \"Every single champion in the game is pretty much balanced\" \n> \n>  I have no idea what game  you're playing but it  can't be League of legends\n\nUrgot OP confirmed.","replies":[{"poster":"Slim Chaedi","date":"2015-02-20T08:10:41.512+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Nestay,realm=OCE,application-id=mR0UmRrp,discussion-id=ABZ7sLfu,comment-id=00000000000000000000000000000000,timestamp=2015-02-20T08:05:15.587+0000)\n>\n> Urgot OP confirmed.\n\nActually, Urgot is pretty good and see a decent amount of play in higher ELOs than lower ELOs.
