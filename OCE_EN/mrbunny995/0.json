No way, not to mention that there are new champions getting released every year. \nEven if Riot allows you to buy 138 rune pages, some time later, when you purchase a new champion, you will find that you still need to change Rune pages in champion select anyway. I don't think Riot can afford adding the number of Rune pages you can buy based on the number of champions released, not to mention some champions share the same runes anyway.\nI highly doubted if Riot would allow you to buy unlimited rune pages.\n","replies":[{"poster":"Akkordian Zoeve","date":"2017-11-19T20:57:09.613+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Not to mention several champions take the same or very similar Runes","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Akkordian Zoeve","date":"2017-11-19T19:06:13.848+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It honestly only takes 10 seconds to edit a page.
