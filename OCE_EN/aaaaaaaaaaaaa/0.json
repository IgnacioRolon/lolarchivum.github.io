I&#039;ve noticed that some roles find it more difficult to get that honour than other roles, specifically support to adc. Carry roles in particular stand out to the team as they&#039;re the focus of the match (usually), whereas a support or jungle will only be noticed by the players that acknowledge their efforts. For this reason, I believe there&#039;s a difference between the roles in receiving honour per game. \n\nNow that we have the data for specific role played every game, I believe we should have honour scaling for the role you play, and the role&#039;s average honour per game difference to the highest average honour per game. \n\n_**Example**_\n\nLet&#039;s say honour is structured around experience. You need 1,000 experience to get to the next level, and each honour is worth 50 exp. For the sake of this example, we will say supports on average receive 0.75 honours per game (or 3 out of every 4 games they are honoured), while mid lane receives on average 1.5 honours per game (they are honoured twice every 2nd game). We will also say that mid lane receives the most honours on average for the sake of this example. After the match is over when you play support, you&#039;ve received 4 honours for your flash heal play on your adc in the final fight of the match. Since supports on average receive half the amount of honours that the mid laner does, they&#039;re worth double the experience, so you received 400 ( 4 x 50 x 2 ) honour experience for the match  (a more accurate difference rate would be something like 1.05 to 1.125 instead of 2).\n\nIf this feature does not already exist, this will assist players in receiving honour level 5 quicker in less favourable roles, without having to rely on making risky plays, or making outstanding plays every game to be acknowledged over a carry.","replies":[{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2018-11-13T08:46:01.519+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"As a support main who plays a game~ a day (more on days off naturally) I hit Honour 5 with heaps of time to spare in the season, and before or not far behind the other people I play with, only one of whom mains support. \n\nI wouldn't think a difference of a week~ is really worth implementing such a complicated system for right?\n\nEven neutral players earn honour, you don't have to do anything spectacular to hit 5 in a reasonable amount of time, nor do you have to earn all that many actual badges. It's more about consistency.","replies":[]}]}
