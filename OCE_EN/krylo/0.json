Essentially our team will need to hit 10 (or 15?) wins. \n\n* You absolutely need to be playing frequently so we can secure the 10 wins. _That is really the only mandatory requirement! _\n* Preferably your rank will be Gold or above, however I&#039;m okay with taking on lower ranks so long as you&#039;re willing to learn. \n\n\nPlease leave your **IGN, Rank &amp; Main Role**. \n\nExtra points for those willing to be flexible with their roles.\n\n**EDIT:** I've added everyone so far but there is an excess of players. To cater for that, I've created a second team which will have its own captain. There are still spots open for the second team.","replies":[{"poster":"Cuddly Panda","date":"2016-10-06T05:17:13.799+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Cuddly Panda / P1 / Support","replies":[]},{"poster":"WarlordAkiro","date":"2016-10-06T04:35:00.284+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"WarlordAkiro\nB2 promos\nmid/jg/sup idm","replies":[]},{"poster":"Sonìc","date":"2016-10-05T12:44:22.096+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"IGN: ix sonic x\nDiamond V\nSupport pref, can play mid top or jg (2 - 3Certain champs only in each of those pos.)","replies":[{"poster":"krylo","date":"2016-10-06T03:41:25.559+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Added","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"darkai","date":"2016-10-05T12:35:04.004+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Darkai\nPlat4\nCan play any role","replies":[{"poster":"krylo","date":"2016-10-06T03:40:47.015+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Added","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"NIghtshadowb","date":"2016-10-06T00:27:58.252+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"IGN: Nightshadowb \nPlatimum V  \nTop, Support, Jungle pref \n\nI just want that ward skin :P","replies":[]},{"poster":"traloop","date":"2016-10-05T12:03:19.466+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"IGN: Traloop\nRank: Bronze 2 (hopefully bronze 1 by the end of tonight)\nRole: Support\nI am also happy to learn","replies":[]},{"poster":"hðnkƒørÇªmíllè","date":"2016-10-05T11:36:58.847+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yeha gday mate, gold 1, RNG Worlds S6, ad/jg. trying to get ward skin too haha.","replies":[]},{"poster":"and2277","date":"2016-10-05T10:46:48.499+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"and2277\nBronze 4 (happy to learn)\n\nJungle main, but can go everywhere except ADC\nthanks!","replies":[{"poster":"krylo","date":"2016-10-05T11:34:36.021+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Added","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"TriggerLord","date":"2016-10-05T10:55:29.094+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"TriggerLord\nGold V\nADC pref","replies":[{"poster":"krylo","date":"2016-10-05T11:33:12.896+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Added","replies":[]}]}]}
