MMR is a hidden number with hidden calculation, largely to prevent people from abusing the calculations. \n\nSites like op.gg can give you an estimated value, but they are based on op.gg's calculations and not Riot's, so they will never be completely accurate.\n\nBasically, you can view MMR as your 'true' rank, and your visible rank as your measure of progression. MMR is designed to reflect your current skill as quickly as possible, which is why that value is used for matchmaking, and not your visible rank which is designed more as a goal to reach.\n\nBasically, if by your, your team's, and your enemy's MMR you are expected to win that game and you win it, you will earn less LP than the average. If it's an even game, you will earn the average, and if you are expected to lose the game, you will earn more. The inverse is also true.\n\nThere are a few other factors that affect it, most of these 'other' category factors apply when you are in your initial climb or on a big win or loss streak, to prevent short-term results having long-term impacts, and level out once you reach your plateau.","replies":[]}]}]}]}
