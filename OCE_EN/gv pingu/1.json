I am currently in Silver 1 solo/duo and Gold 2 in flex. \r\nI play mostly ADC and Mid lane but I am fairly comfortable in most roles, top probably being my weakest. \r\n\r\nMy champion pool consists of  -\r\nMid \r\n {{champion:34}}  \r\n{{champion:115}} \r\n {{champion:85}} \r\n\r\nAs for ADC I tend to lean towards \r\n{{champion:29}} (no nerf needed rito),\r\n{{champion:67}}  \r\n {{champion:18}} \r\n\r\nIm generally a reasonably passive player and don&#039;t often fight to early or when odds aren&#039;t in our favour. But that doesn&#039;t mean I won&#039;t push the lead when we are ahead or at an advantage. \r\n\r\nSo yeah, if your interested in jamming some duo queue with me to try climb hit me at =&gt; GV Pingu\r\nPreferably you can play support or jungle. No voice coms are needed. Oh and one other thing if your toxic, see yourself out! {{champion:27}}{{summoner:4}}","replies":[{"poster":"ThatsBS","date":"2017-10-09T03:54:12.809+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Im uh bronze 2 looking to get to silver.
