Compared to the other reworks, you basically killed her. Her ult is literally useless for the whole point it was for, AOE slow and harass at 6 to make up for her not so strong early game. Now she just gets out traded in possibly every way. \r\n\r\nMain champ since start of Season 2 and will probably never play her again because now since ANYTHING MID is more viable than her.","replies":[{"poster":"fattyhotdogs","date":"2016-05-05T09:22:25.076+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I don't play Anivia, but I read her notes as a buff.\n\nI'm assuming that your tears are over the ult?

The casting range is the same to use for escapes, using it offensively you gotta get a little closer to get it under them, who cares, ult - E - Ignite for kill anyway.  or  - use your damn wall like you're supposed to.","replies":[]}]}
