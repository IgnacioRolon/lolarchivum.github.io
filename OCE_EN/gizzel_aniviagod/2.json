Now, this wouldnt really be an issue if you could actually be able to tell someone what they did wrong or question why they did something. As soon as you do this &quot;wahh toxic&quot;. So, after 3 promos in a row where i win my lane to see every other lane being a feeding filth fest, players not backing off after 10 pings, building the most retarded shit.. and im just suppose to sit back and smile while waving not only promos or a win good bye, my time aswell? \n\nAfter these 3 games and being frustrated, having death threats and what not. I called players out for being bad. Its true, there garbage shit tier players. BUT AS SOON AS YOU SAY THAT. 24 game chat restriction. \n\nHOW IN THE FUCK?\n\nThis is why this company is fucking terrible. Dunkys video about league sums it up, this is why i quit in the first place. If for what ever reason you DC, Bugsplat, Cant connect, reguardless if its riots client or not, you will receive -20LP and possibly low priority q. I got this when they released the new client and every patch my games glitched. Punished for something that shouldnt be my problem, cool awesome. So this is exactly the same. \n\nI had a game 2 days ago where a guy on my team died FB at 4 minutes, tilted and just ran down mid 19 times. I see players who&#039;re clearly boosted, I see players in countless games that are very unskilled, unable to speak english or are tilting %%%gots. But for whatever reason.. RIOT DOESNT LET YOU SAY ANYTHING OR ELSE YOU WILL GET BENT OVER. YOU, THE GUY TRYING TO WIN, THE GUY EXPLAINING WHAT MISTAKES THEY HAVE MADE. \n\nNot everyone is right, shit happens.. BUT STOP FUCKING PLAYERS OVER WITH &quot;toxic&quot; BULLSHIT BECAUSE OF WHAT IWILLLDOMINATE DID 5 YEARS AGO.\n\nil add, ive spent hundreds on $$ on this game, i own almost every skin. Ive played this game since release, and i will gladly call you a bunch of %%%%s in hopes you ban my accounts so i have a excuse as to not log into your piece of shit self centred unbalanced joke of a fucking game where the punishment system is soo busted it doesnt matter how fucking terrible you are or if youre buying accounts ruining games for everyone. No, it matters if you call a bad player bad. Get fucked.","replies":[{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2017-03-18T05:31:27.278+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Telling someone what they could have done better is not the same as abusing them for a mistake they know they made. (e.g \"We need to stay behind the ward line\" or \"??? *spam pinging dead body* ???\".\n\nDefending yourself is not the same as abusing someone back. (e.g \"I don't appreciate your language\" or \"fk you fking shit piece of trash\")\n\nSomeone else being overwhelmingly toxic is not an excuse for you to escalate and further ruin the experience of the other 3-8 people.\n\nObviously I'm talking extremes here, but if you really want to know why you got a chat restriction, post your logs ans we can tell you. It is extremely unlikely you were restricted without reason, though false positives do happen from time to time. Someone else's behaviour does not serve as justification of your own, which is why you only see YOUR chat logs in a reform card.\n\nAs for your other points.\n\n>If for what ever reason you DC...\n\nThis is a multiplayer game. If you are having connection or PC issues frequently enough to get LB then you really shouldn't be playing ranked. As for copping a loss, you have cost 4 other people a loss as well, which they had absolutely no power over. Or are you saying that noone should cop a loss if someone DCs? Think about how easily that could be abused. \n\nIf you were having client trouble, then you should have done something to fix it, like, you know, repair it or reinstall it maybe? Instead it seems you just said \"fk that\" and continued to play on a dodgy install. Those kind of issues are CLIENT side, not server side, so yes, it should be your problem and it is your responsibility to fix it.\n\n>I had a game 2 days ago where a guy on my team died FB at 4 minutes, tilted and just ran down mid 19 times.\n\nSure, intent feeders exist, every one knows it, and everyone else has to deal with them same as you. Report it and move on.\n\n>I see players who're clearly boosted\n\nSame deal.\n\n>I see players in countless games that are very unskilled\n\nNot punishbale, the skill they have is reflected in their rank, so it they're playing with you (and have more than like 10 games there) it's because their mmr matches yours. Would you like to be punished based on those couple games where you get filled into your worst role, or are just generally having a bad game and underperforming?\n\n\n> unable to speak english\n\nAlso not punishable, that's what pings are for. Use them. They are here to play the game just like everyone else, and have no more or less right to that privilege than you do.\n\n> tilting %%%gots\n\nStill not punishable, tilt happens, you sound rather tilted yourself in fact. It is a part of the natural cycle of games you play. Some you will play really well, others you will be tilted and underperform. Also, in case it wasn't immensely obvious, hate speech is a big nono and will get you banned from boards just as quickly as it will see you banned in game.\n\n>RIOT DOESNT LET YOU SAY ANYTHING OR ELSE YOU WILL GET BENT OVER. YOU, THE GUY TRYING TO WIN, THE GUY EXPLAINING WHAT MISTAKES THEY HAVE MADE.\n\nSee my first points. You were not restricted for saying something, you were restricted for WHAT you said.\n\n>i will gladly call you a bunch of %%%%s in hopes you ban my accounts so i have a excuse as to not log into your piece of shit self centred unbalanced joke of a fucking game\n\nIf you hate it so much then don't log in. A chat restriction is a warning, and if you continue in game in this manner, then you WILL see a perma ban eventually, and you will lose those hundreds of $$ that you have spent with noone but yourself to blame.\n\n>the punishment system is soo busted it doesnt matter how fucking terrible you are or if youre buying accounts ruining games for everyone. No, it matters if you call a bad player bad. Get fucked.\n\nYou seem to think, that just because you got punished, noone else ever has. Riot is perfectly capable of punishing more than a single player at a time, they can even punish multiple players in a single game! \n\nBuying accounts will see you punished. Ruining games for others will see you punished. Abusing 'bad' players will see you punished.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Gizzel AniviaGod","date":"2017-03-18T01:20:44.993+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"I might add, i just noticed the 25 game chat ban was based on only 1 game, a game where my support told me to kill myself, get beat by my dad, ran it down mid then afk'd the game. \n\nNice review riot, i wonder how long you spent on it, 1 minute? complete garbage.","replies":[{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2017-03-18T05:32:17.776+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"If you think it's garbage then post your logs and we can tell you why you were punished.","replies":[]}]}]}
