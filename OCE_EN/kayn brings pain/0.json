A TANK THAT HAS NO DAMAGE ITEMS CAN DO MORE DAMAGE THAN A AP BUILD WITH PENETRATION AND SUSTAINS DAMAGE... SO WHATS THE PURPOSE OF GOING A MAGE AND ALL THESE OTHER PLAYERS WHEN YOU CAN BE A TANK AND JUST CHARGE IN DO DAMAGE AND TAKE NO DAMAGE IT&#039;S A BIT BS IT RUINS LEAGUE OF LEGENDS. IF THEY HAVE 3 TANKS AND U HAVE 1 OR 2 YOU WILL LOSE THE GAME LATE GAME CAUSE TANKS ARE TO OVER POWERED ....

All I was trying to accomplish with that post was to point out that it's not a \"discussion\", since you've clearly already come to a definite conclusion (and seem to be dismissive of any opposing ideas). One thing to keep in mind is that, in regards to text communication, all caps is often accepted as the equivalent of yelling, so it's easy to see why someone might \"misinterpret\" your post as being intended as a \"scream post\". If you want to put extra emphasis on specific terms/phrases, I'd recommend using *italics*, or even **bold text** (which can be accomplished on the boards using either one or two asterisk \"*\" [respectively] both at the start and end of the term/phrase you want to emphasise). At the very least, you could simply use caps for only specific terms/phrases to emphasise them relative to the rest of the post, but a post using nothing _but_ caps just comes off as \"yelling\" to most people.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Roguestoney","date":"2018-04-26T23:02:35.633+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"1 way conversation ðŸ˜‚","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"BlemFoReal","date":"2018-04-26T03:40:30.024+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"its not kass's job to kill tanks. settle. know your champion and what its strengths are. he isnt a tank killer....","replies":[{"poster":"KAYN BRINGS PAIN","date":"2018-04-26T03:41:13.728+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"I SEE SO SPECIFIC CHARACTERS HAVE SPECIFIC ROLES FOR CHAMPIONS","replies":[{"poster":"Mozzie25","date":"2018-04-26T07:56:20.944+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yes?","replies":[{"poster":"Project Xayah","date":"2018-04-26T08:02:02.830+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"No?\n\nI...
