As in my earlier example, Oxford's definitions for \"staff\" would exclude volunteers, but if you were to look at something else, namely Cambridge Dictionary, you might find that their definitions do include volunteers (though that's one definition among several and the \"American-English\" version).\n\nEven when considering \"worker\" instead, it still seems as though some sources (Oxford, for example) exclude volunteers while others (Cambridge, for example) include them.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Nightjar","date":"2018-05-11T00:34:43.884+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":1,"body":"even if the conversation wasn't very well presented, the argument over whether banning a teammates pick was valid or if combined with sufficient harassment deserves a report, is quite a contentious debate, with alot of potential for exploration.\n\nPersonally I'm still not sure about whether this should be reportable or even bannable. Since whilst banning a champion to deny the enemy team seems perfectly reasonable. Banning out the first pick of the game, and goading a teammate seems like poor sportsmanship and harassment.\n\nA reasonable arguement is that having a pregame report feature should also be available, since I don't want to have to play with that abusive teammate to have the option to report him and protect the rest of the community from such abuse without having to play with the cockroach and lose lp.\n\nRiot's volunteers need to stop being so stuck up and heavy handed. Asking the thread creator to restructure and improve the thread post is a much more appropriate response.","replies":[{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2018-05-11T01:57:56.854+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"I'm more than a little confused as to the context of your comment. No posts were removed, only his comment. A comment that had no content except \"Shut up no one cares what you have to say you ignorant ahole\".\n\nNoone was arguing that the discussion was invalid or not worth having. In fact that comment wasn't even on the thread about banning teammate picks, it was on a thread about the punishment system. \n\nIn fact, the guy has only ever had one comment, that was one line and existed solely as an insult, actually removed, ever. How is that heavy handed?","replies":[{"poster":"Nightjar","date":"2018-05-14T00:13:49.197+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"personally I don't care about him, his rude comments are the least of my concerns, such vulgar and unproductive language is very reasonable to censor.\n\nThe issue was *everyone else* was discussing the validity of team-self-bans, and the thread started in a very valid fashion. Maybe he ended up being inappropriate, but the initial post starting the thread sparked reasonable discussion, and I'm a little put out, that the rest of the discussion was lost.","replies":[{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2018-05-14T05:27:41.405+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I remember the discussion you're talking about, and can't find it so I can only assume it has been deleted, but I assure you it wasn't by a mod.
