I was riven top lane vs Garren and my W stun&#039;s where ineffective every time but we still won in the end. The only way i can get Garren in a W stun is before he gets his legs off the ground when he Q&#039;s it&#039;s a bit unfair. A stun should work before a melee has landed wouldn&#039;t that make more sense.","replies":[]}
