You stuffing the game up","subforum":"Gameplay & Strategy","up_votes":3,"down_votes":2,"body":"i remember riv being a fighter not a assassin. Oh and the game is getting more worse and worse the more updates they do the more the game goes to shit. Even tower glitches and shoots out of range minions will attack you even if you have minions in front of you. Tower can 2 shot you dead. The runes aren&#039;t really custom like the way it used to be was so much better nothing is unique anymore everyone has the same ruin builds/ This game is starting to become AIDS its all over the shop mages are the new OP champs like these clowns should have left it alone the idiots.","replies":[{"poster":"Bookbash","date":"2018-05-08T04:34:28.122+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I don't think that the game can ever really be what it was, it's constantly changing. The thing is they makes changes **too quickly**. Before you get to settle in and enjoy something about that game that you enjoy.\nRiot are just trying to make the most money in the fastest way possible. Some fighters don't really have a place in the current meta. Champions like Aatrox and Kayle are absolute trash (they can work against noobs, but talking from a competitive point of view here, i.e. the highest levels). Items and runes have changed the playstyle of the top lane.\n\nYou have to consider: Is the game still fun, or am I just playing into a feeling of pain every time? It's going to keep changing into a slightly different game on the same map, with some core principles still applying.\n\nImagine if Riot changed the game so that players would no longer gain experience by farming or being near monsters/minion/tower kills, but only by killing champions? That sort of thing would change the game also, and the meta. junglers would not really be needed in the early game, they would probably send 2 top. Or even 5 mid like back in the days. It would be a HUGE shift in the game. Thankfully they don't do that sort of thing. It might be welcome in OCE though, could make them more competitive in international events because less macro would be required.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Lord Sesshomaru","date":"2018-05-07T23:25:07.873+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I think balancing league is a little like driving a big boat or plane.\n\nYou turn the wheel, and for a brief moment, nothing happens. If you just leave it, after the moment the change will take effect.\nBut the natural instinct when nothing happens is to turn the wheel again, and if you do that, you now turn the vehicle too far! Then you turn the wheel again the other way to correct the mistake, but for a moment, nothing happens, so you turn the wheel harder, and now you go too far the wrong way, and you end up in an endless feedback loop that spirals the vehicle into disaster.\n\nLeague seems to be doing that, they're changing a lot, often. And without the proper intervals to let things settle, things naturally get out of whack, but when they do get out of whack, rather than looking back and thinking \"What did we do wrong to cause this\", they just change those things as well. Which only compounds the problem.\n\n_**E.g.**_ _reverting LB was a big change, but rather than let that settle and see how she performs, they re-vamp all the mage items at the same time. So now when things inevitably go wrong, its much much harder to find out wether the problem was something in LB's new kit, or something to do with the new mage itemisation._\n\n_Or when Zed went through his phase of bing a massive problem (I mean more than usual), rather than just taking Zed's numbers down a few pegs, they reworked the entire armour-pen/lethality system, which took Zed down, and turned every fighter in the game into an assassin!_\n\nThis self-destructive cycle can only be kept up for so long before you lose control completely. \nIt does have an expiration date.","replies":[{"poster":"KAYN BRINGS PAIN","date":"2018-05-09T07:07:38.612+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You are completely right. {{champion:141}}","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"SOOM","date":"2018-05-07T18:40:43.512+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"You by any chance honour 0?","replies":[{"poster":"KAYN BRINGS PAIN","date":"2018-05-09T19:16:49.495+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Nope sorry i get honored by real players to much.
