I've looked a bit at your recent match history and it seems that a lot of the players you've been matched with that have had low K/D/A ratios were just having a bad game. Looking through their match histories, it seems relatively common for them to be getting scores \"typical\" of low elo, even those on the \"lower\" side of K/D/A ratios.\n\nWith that in mind, I couldn't help but notice that you yourself occasionally get 10+ deaths in a given match, and not always with significant takedowns either. Am I to assume that you were feeding in those situations? Or would you agree that they were simple \"bad games\", whether it be due to tilt, or being abuse or \"bad\" teammates, whatever else might be the case? Because, honestly, if you're going to be claiming these players are \"feeding\", then the same must also apply to you, given some of the ratios you get.\n\nSomething to consider, anyway.","replies":[{"poster":"KAYN BRINGS PAIN","date":"2018-04-22T04:02:53.195+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"Well its hard not to die to a fed team \nLMAO","replies":[{"poster":"KAYN BRINGS PAIN","date":"2018-04-22T04:03:19.404+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"but you know everything right","replies":[{"poster":"KAYN BRINGS PAIN","date":"2018-04-22T04:38:13.148+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"i bet you don't even play the game so you don't have no idea what it's like i read the forum on riot's staff you guys don't even play LOL cause you guys are so bad but you can judge me by looking at history not watching the match. lmao","replies":[{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2018-04-22T13:17:06.239+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"I think you entirely missed the point. The point was, if you consider having 10+ deaths feeding, and that players who achieve those scores should be punished, then you too would fall into that category. Everyone has those games. To expect others to be perfect players, while you yourself aren't one (noone is), is entirely unreasonable.\n\nIn your recent games you've had 7 games with more than 10 deaths, should you be punished for those games?","replies":[{"poster":"KAYN BRINGS PAIN","date":"2018-04-23T01:04:12.307+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"You are missing the point im not talking about people having a bad game im talking about the poeple who just keep walking in even though you and the team tell them not to.

Disagreeing with you and discussing that disagreement is not the same as harassing. Throwing insults around like \"go suck a fat one\" is harassing. There's also no staff here, I'm only a volunteer and HeartVine has no affiliation to Riot at all. HeartVine's point was all those people you seem to think are intent feeding appear to have just had bad games. \n\nTilt and intent feeding aren't the same thing. Disagreeing with you as to how a game or teamfight should be played and intent feeding are not the same thing. Dying a bunch by getting caught out of position and intent feeding are not the same thing.","replies":[{"poster":"KAYN BRINGS PAIN","date":"2018-04-26T03:39:07.231+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"NOT WATCHING THE MATCH AND COMING UP WITH THEORIES TO ACCUSE ME ISN'T DISAGREEING ITS DEGRADING.\nANYWAYS I'M DONE WITH THIS DISCUSSION  {{champion:141}}","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"KAYN BRINGS PAIN","date":"2018-04-22T04:39:47.067+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"out of my recent 20 matches i have 4 losses so thats 16  wins ","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"DarkShade918","date":"2018-04-22T07:05:31.770+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"Heartvine trying to be reasonable with you, so you abuse him/her.... and you think your teams are bad mayhaps riot is aware of your toxicity, so puts you with players of similar mindset, also, maybe before you criticise other feeders, look at your own history you have a lot of games with neg kda even in some of your wins...","replies":[]},{"poster":"Roguestoney","date":"2018-04-20T06:58:54.262+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"YBR is that you?","replies":[{"poster":"Mozzie25","date":"2018-04-22T13:26:05.322+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thatâ€™s what I thought when I saw this post","replies":[{"poster":"Roguestoney","date":"2018-04-22T23:17:34.130+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"If it is there will be more stupid posts i guess.
