Being able to discuss quickly and concisely strategy and plans, and being able to tell people in seconds \"don't do that, i'm not able to followup since I have no mana\" and etc..","replies":[{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2018-05-01T05:18:32.617+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"There will always be those elements in any online game, but ultimately it's still the internet.

Harder to track negative behaviour, and easier for asshats to pick targets for abuse like accents, age or gender.

Overwatch was way more toxic for me than League ever was because of voice chat, but perhaps that is simply my experience as a minority in gaming.\n\nWhat I take from what you just said is, you only see the negative in voice chat, you don't see the positive, I mean, that's blatant from the fact you instantly say \"it's harder to track negative behaviour\", and it's obviously the way Riot thinks as well, which is very much what I see wrong with the attitude towards progress. In my opinion, steps should be taken to make negative behaviour less of a likely thing, rather than focusing on catching it, tackle it head on rather than just placing brick walls for (both sides) people to headbutt until they bleed out their frontal lobe on their keyboard or whatever.\n\nPeople are more willing to mute people who abuse through voice, especially if they play through speakers and not headphones. So I see it as less of a problem and more of a pro-active solution.\n\nAnd if we're going to talk experience, i've experienced a handful of abusive people in Overwatch over voice, with thousands of hours played. We're talking different demographics though since that's a paid-for game. LoL being free you get a far broader demographic, usually younger. Something equivalent would be Fortnite, I would say i've experienced for more cooperative people in Fortnite, and people willing to cooperate and communicate, with voice chat as a default alternative, no typing  even happens. Even if I get obvious idiots or lamebrains, it usually makes for a far more fun experience being able to laugh with them if/when they fuck up and die, or whatever.\n\nOf course, that's not the same level of competitiveness or time-sink as League is so it's different on that level as well.\n\nAnd see, getting back to the \"you or your teammates\" and \"only effect you as much as you let them\". Sorry, no, trolls and griefers effect your ability to play and enjoy the game whether you \"let them or not\". That's a ridiculous thing to even think, let alone say. \nI mean, i'm sorry if this seems foreign to you, but when the enemy jungler has a 10 kill advantage at 10 minutes and literally just 1 shots everyone under their turrets, there is absolutely no way to have fun or enjoy the game, if you don't get mad at a troll or greifer who causes that intentionally, to me you're broken. You've resigned yourself to being trodden on.\nEspecially when you know your report of trolling or griefing will result in nothing. I've reported hundreds of intentional griefers and trollers, and i see them over and over and over in games, games and games straight, days later, weeks later, they still have their accounts and still do what they do.\nSure some of them don't do it EVERY game, they win games here and there and maintain roughly the same rank, but as soon as they aren't the star player on their team, they int and troll out of embarrassment or otherwise. Happens every 2nd game in this community. Some kid gets stomped in lane, doesn't calm down and just cs, decides to try to 1v2 turret dive and fight someone they couldn't kill when only a little behind, when they're mega behind.\nI don't see that as anything but trolling. Some say it's just the way some people are \"people lose their cool and tilt\". Well if I can be banned for \"being who I am\" about getting mad at these people, they should be able to be banned for \"being who they are\" for being assholes who intentionally fuck other people's games over with their emotions as well. Pretty sound logic according to me. (if that's the standard we're using)","replies":[{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2018-05-01T10:18:11.599+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"My view on voice chat is it is essentially an experience amplifier. For positive communication, it makes it easier and faster. For negative communication it makes it that much worse. I see both sides. I didn't dislike it being a thing in Overwatch, but I found myself avoiding using it because it made me a target (which I imagine applies to a significant portion of any given gaming community in OCE). I don't dislike that League only has it in a limited way, because I *understand* the perils.\n\nIn my experience, voice chat (outside of premades/guilds/parties etc) is always more prone to negativity. For a long while I played Overwatch and League about 50/50, and yes, there are different factors to consider for each but I feel they are comparable enough gameplay and demographic wise. By far I experienced more toxicity in Overwatch than I did in League. I can't speak for Fortnite, I don't play it, but yes games are different. ESO is by far the least toxic online game I've played, even on voice chat with PUGs. Even on voice chat with bad PUGs.\n\nSome of that is likely because there's less of a thought filter to just say something, than there is to have to actually type it out, which means the casual toxics and those lacking in self control become a much bigger factor. Some of that is also likely because on voice chat you can't (easily) hide things like gender, which for those among the gaming community who feel [x discriminatory thing] makes you a target and therefore more likely to experience that behaviour. Perhaps this is why your experience differs, but again it's the whole amplifier thing. For those people that find targets to abuse, voice chat makes it that much easier.\n\nAs for being more likely to mute voice chat, sure, but if you have to mute someone the damage is already done. Someone screaming \"YOU F%%%ING [sexist term]\" over voice (true story, more than once) is a lot more jarring and has a much more lasting effect that someone typing the exact same. Even if I were to mute them immediately, it's still soured the experience.\n\nI think we'll have to agree to disagree on \"trolls and griefers effect your ability to play and enjoy the game whether you let them or not\". I'm not saying I'm immune or unaffected, because I'm not, but unless I'm already in a foul mood or have other stuff going on, I can usually at least partially salvage the experience. That's not to say I don't get mad, because I do. If someone is being an asshole that's the instinctual response, it's what you do after that counts.\n\nPerhaps it's because I have accepted that you can't win every game so there's no point fussing over one loss, might as well just have fun with the rest of the team/enemy and get on with life instead of letting some random moron keep you down. To me, winning isn't the fun, the experience is, so just being unable to win a game isn't a deal breaker for me.\n\nThat aside though, surely you at least realise by getting angry you are giving them exactly what they want? You aren't putting them in their place, you're fuelling the fire. You're encouraging them to continue. If you're whole goal is to shut them down and teach them the error of their ways, you're doing exactly the wrong thing to get that outcome.\n\nAnd for the record, I never said trolls and griefers shouldn't be punished, what I said was, stooping to their level isn't fun, doesn't help, and makes you just as bad as them.","replies":[{"poster":"Gloric","date":"2018-05-01T12:16:50.644+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Seras Dragon,realm=OCE,application-id=FjGAIbRv,discussion-id=AwHGvUXA,comment-id=000100010000000000000000,timestamp=2018-05-01T10:18:11.599+0000)\n\n> That aside though, surely you at least realise by getting angry you are giving them exactly what they want?

There are plenty who do it out of a sense of embarrassment/ego, and I will not let them stoop to that level without suffering some sort of reprimand.\nThat's all i'll really say on that, I could type for hours on what I think and you could reply with what you think on the motives of such people and how to handle them, but I think i've made my opinion clear on that.\n\nOne thing i've also noticed, most people don't seem to care WHAT you are saying. The MOST common things I see, and it usually matches up with the reality of what's going on in the chat, is \"you talk too much\".\nNot \"stop insulting people\" or \"stop being negative\" or \"stop being so mean\" or anything like that, literally, word for word \"you talk too much\". Like it's somehow effecting their game to read anything at all. Which is another reason I think voice chat would be a positive addition to the game. Established in many studies, most people, especially when young, learn primarily and are most susceptible to learning through phonetics and voice imprint, not reading.\n\nI get the discrimination thing, plenty of dumb ass men of all ages who throw out the sexist and racist shit in voice chat whenever they experience anything they can point fingers at. I get it, it's not ideal. \nBut there's one thing that won't cure that in society, and that's censorship. Exposure and making it the norm, making it so some guy pointing out \"HURDURR A GIRL\" or \"you C#*&\" just looks like a lame brain.\nYou know who won't cop some kid spouting that shit in chat? yeah, you're looking at him. I will brow beat that kid into a whole other mental space, not even aggressively, just as a matter of taking the topic out of the voice environment because not only is it retarded and cringey, but hey, as much as I lose my shit, I have a morale compass.\n\nBut also, to extent on the exposure thing... by today's standards, the whole \"omg you're 2# and you play videogames?!\" just sounds.... like a really weird thing to be surprised/weirded out by. As it's been well established for years that the average gamer is over 30. I hear it said here and there by some kid who's never run into (as far as he knows) anyone with balls that have dropped below their ribcage, but  even they generally sense how odd the topic is once the person goes \"and?\".\n\nJust now in society, \"nerd\" has all but completely died as an insult. Who on earth uses the term nerd as an insult but the most lame brained in society? lol\n\nAnyway, I think i'll sum it up as you should be less afraid of these types in voice chat as it really is the only way society will move forward with acceptance.","replies":[{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2018-05-01T13:35:46.405+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I think we're just plain gonna disagree on the approach here, but I'd leave you with the consideration that this game is only rated 13+.
