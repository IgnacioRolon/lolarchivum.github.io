If not, then your specs just aren't good enough/turn down the graphics.\nIf the specs are fine though, I suggest you run some tests. Are you using wireless or a network cable? Does it have connection issues with anything? Try sending a large file between the computers on the LAN and see if the speed just dips sometimes.\nIt could be an issue with a faulty network card.\nIf you have a phone or something that can connect to the WiFi and then tether to the computer to give it network access, see if you get the same problems with lag. Like, just sit in a custom game for a bit.","replies":[]}]}
