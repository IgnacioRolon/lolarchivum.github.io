I've double checked your account and it looks like you've received XP (at least on the server side) for the games that were lost.  Can you check in your match history in client and see if it shows there (its near the right, beside the replay download button).  It is entirely possible there's a bug in client that is stopping it displaying correctly after the game finishes, which isn't ideal.\n\nWith regards to the new rune selection mechanics - there are likely a few kinks to iron out here, and it sounds like for lower spec machines like yours there might be some tweaks to be done to get it to run smoothly.  Thanks for your thoughts on the way selection in champ select has changed for you in light of the number of rune pages you have, vs how you previously used the mastery system.\n\nThe change to blue essence from IP is certainly something that we're watching feedback on closely - would be interested to hear your experiences after a few days / weeks as everyone becomes more used to how it behaves in practice.\n\nCheers!\nMindstar","replies":[{"poster":"Dagina","date":"2017-11-08T06:30:58.986+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thank you for the reply, i do apologise for how rude i must of sounded in the post, i was rather mad at the time. i had several people ranting with me about the BE system and it going to take forever to get the few champs they don't have like me.\n\ni have checked and yes the XP are in the match history, just seems it was a bug displaying the 0XP in the post match lobby. so hey, bug reported i guess, hahaha.\n\nill try and upload how i feel further into the update about the BE and if the rune system runs smoother. \n\nthank you for the reply, and again sorry for the ranting i feel so bad about it now ;-;","replies":[]}]}]}
