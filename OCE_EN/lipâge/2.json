While random ping spikes can happen, there are usually pattens to them. Playing at certain times, having a certain number of people on the internet, doing background downloads can all cause this.  Before starting a game, it is always best to do a [ping check](http://boards.oce.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/miscellaneous/EodBxhd4-ping-checker). Playing when you know you are going to have high ping or are likely to experience gigantic spikes is really putting your team in a disadvantaged position and is frustrating af. \n\n2. To more specifically answer your question, the best you can do is mute your flaming teammates and continue playing to the best of your ability. \n\nOn to the topic of your post in PB: \n>What do i do when my team mates start to troll in rank?\nWhats the point in trying if youre going to lose lp...\ni think each individual should be based on their perfomance in game even though they lost they still get to win/lose just a small amount of lp\n\nIt depends on what you mean by trolling. You are in low bronze, a division made up of some of the least-skilled players on the server. People are going to be bad, and not always intentionally. \n\nThere is still plenty of point in trying, even if you think you are going to lose LP. Getting into a ranked game and having a \"woe is me, my team are trolls\" attitude isn't going to get you anywhere. In fact, it is likely that you will start subconsciously tilting yourself before you even get into lane, resulting in many of your own mistakes, which can compound and impact the outcome of the game. \n\n>[WHY DON'T YOU INCLUDE OTHER DETAILS, LIKE HOW MANY KILLS OR DEATHS I HAD, TO DETERMINE MY RATING?](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752954-Matchmaking-Guide#q2)\nIf we did, it would encourage players to focus on killing other players instead of strategically winning the game. For instance, players who choose supporting champions would be adversely affected because they are not expected to earn kills. By putting as many measurements and incentives as possible on specifically winning a game, we avoid side behaviors that aren't as fun and confuse the rating process.","replies":[{"poster":"YellowBrickRoad","date":"2016-05-21T06:52:30.399+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Tbh the mastery system already shows that riot is capable of doing role specific performance metrics.\n\nWhy not just add those same performance metrics to the mmr gain and loss calculation so as to reward personal improvement, rather than having to literally drag 4 anchors up with you if you are capable of climbing.\n\nHell the current system without individual performance metrics actually supports people not being in their correct mmr.\n\nBeacuse for every person that doesnt belong there and is so far out of his league that he can actually 1v5 carry, there is atleast 4 people that are having their mmr artificically increased by him thus compounding the inaccuracies of the system even further (as the mmr increases those people get will inevitably lead them to playing against an mmr that no one can carry them in and will then artificially decrease the mmr of their team causing a yo-yo effect)\n\nThis is further compounded by the opposing team being artificially decreased in mmr.\n\nIts pretty much the entire reason smurfs are looked down upon, because you can look at it as 9 players are having their mmrs altered in ways that dont actually reflect where they are at the game.\n\nBut you can look at it even further and realise that this has a knock on affect that causes a wave of mmr increases and decreases causing widespread inaccuracies.\n\nTheres a reason the mmr system was designed for 1v1 style sports like chess.\n\nAnd not team based situations.\n\nHell even for team based mmr its designed around the premise that all players in the team are equal and there are no weak links, and are thus working as a unit or atleast on an equal footing.\n\nAs it currently stands i have the mmr of a bronze 5 player thanks to a combination of last seasons mmr reset dropping me from b2 to b5, combined with a swade of new players suddenly excited to play ranked due to dynamic queue that i can not physically carry to a win further decreasing my mmr.\n\nAs such when im in a calm state of mind and not tilted or raging at my team, i will absolutely DEMOLISH the enemy team to the point of literally being called a god in game (like shit the percentage of players who have gotten a pentakill in ranked is not very high, i had 5 stolen off me in a matter of weeks)\n\nAnd its not because im good at the game, its because my mmr is far lower than it should be and it still going down due to the way the current system works.\n\nBasically it is a broken system that punishes players who cannot find consistent teammates to queue with.\n\nAnd allows for complete imbeciles to fluke their way to higher ranks and drag other people down with them in their inevitable drop from being in an mmr that is too high for them.\n\nFor instance how many games do you think it takes to escape b5? not counting for shit teams and yo-yoing effects (pretty much why i had about 100 games in b5 this season)\n\nits 6 games btw accounting for low mmr and promo helper.\n\nHow many games do you think it takes to repair all the mmr you lost from special snowflakes in b5 just to gain more than 15 lp in b4? well ive been in b4 for nearly 20 games now, and im still not breaking the 20 lp mark.\n\nDo you know how much faster that system would be if they looked at things like \"oh well his ward was always on cooldown, he buys a pink ward every now and then and they stay alive for very long times, he pushed X towers and got X dragons and he has a kda of 11, clearly this person doesnt belong in this mmr so we will give him a slightly higher mmr gain for this match\"\n\nLike shit using kda instead of k/d means even supports benefit, like shit the highest kda ive ever gotten was on a thresh support, i had like 32 assists and 12 kills to 2 deaths or something stupid crazy like that, thats a kda of 22.\n\nHell you could even just tie mmr gain and loss to your mastery grade for that match.\n\nS+ is supposed to be top 2% of players for that champion and role right? so shouldnt mmr reflect the fact that you are clearly capable of playing at a top percentile level, regardless of what your current mmr may be.\n\nThe other thing is making it easier to maintain an upwards growth in mmr would in turn make players more skillful.\n\nBecause playing against players below your mmr doesnt teach you anything and in fact on the contrary makes you a worse player because you become sloppy.\n\nPlaying against people above your mmr while harder atleast keeps you on your toes and forces you to learn how to play at that mmr thus facilitating further growth.","replies":[]}]}]}
