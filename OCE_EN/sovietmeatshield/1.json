More Famous than his Alcholoic drinks, is the luxurious Malvado brewery it&#039;s self, A magnificent industrial palace with golden walls and three towering smoke chimneys which gently pour out clouds of glowing purple smoke. Doubling as a casino, The brewery attracts all who&#039;s pockets are overflowing and ambitious gamblers left even more cocky by the owner&#039;s brew, some secretly traveling to the grand spectacle pursuing rumors of the brewery&#039;s discreet &quot;third service&quot; as an exotic brothel (boasting a collection of the most beautiful women &quot;gathered&quot; from all corners of runeterra). What isn&#039;t well know is the man behind this adored product, besides a couple of theory and brief public appearances, Diego Malvado remains a figure of legend behind the brewery. A gentleman of fine taste and housing velvet tongue, Diego is known to have connections across all levels of Zaun and Piltover, which many hold to be the reason for the law&#039;s dendancy to turn a blind eye to the several &quot;Strange&quot; occurrences that seem to be connected to him. Countless rumors circle that warn people of Diego being a demon of excess, a man who deals with immoral magic or the crime boss responsible for hundreds of disappearances in the streets around the brewery. Some paranoid souls even theorize that Malvado stalks Zaun&#039;s streets at night, harvesting the essence of naive people to use as ingredients for his Luiqour. Claiming it is the souls of this victims which makes the brand so sweet.... But they are just rumors...are they not.\r\n\r\nAppearance: A tall thin man, Diego strides with a confident posture anywhere he goes, wearing a white buttoned shirt, silky green waistcoat with elaborate golden symbols woven onto it, a matching tie, thick silver chain necklace holding a bottle of golden whiskey, long black pants, polished black shoes with gold lining and heels , three belts, one  holding a string of jars containing a glowing blue liquid in them, the second lined with three bottles of glowing golden whiskey and the third bears a large golden belt buckle with the initials &quot;D.M&quot; printed on it. He has short black hair and sports a clean shaven look, having a pencil mustache and thin goatee. the top half of Diego&#039;s right head has been completely replaced with a metal skull, the exposed metal place reaching the tip of his right ear and the top of his right cheek, with his right eye replaced by a hollow socket which glows with a pale blue aura that seeps out constantly. Diego also carries around a long black cane sword that has a golden loin head.\r\n\r\nAbilities:\r\n\r\nPassive: &quot;Lullaby&quot;/ &quot;Velvet tongue&quot;\r\n\r\nBeing a known sweet talker, Diego can form a persistent yet calming aura to surround him, should he avoid damage successful for 10 continuous seconds. His Aura forms a small radius around which  &quot;lulls&quot; all surrounding champions to enjoy his company (Friendly champions and Diego himself gain damage immunity for any initial strike  coming from enemy champions should the Aura be active, instantly break after the first hit.) \r\n\r\n\r\nQ-&quot;Distill soul&quot;\r\n\r\nDiego will hurls his chain rope dart at a targeted champion or minion and create a &quot;Soul&quot; connection (a glowing trail of blue aura) between one another  for about 3-4 seconds. During the forced link, Diego will drain a portion of the target&#039;s health until the connection &quot;snaps&quot; spawning a glowing &quot;Soul&quot; jar on the floor beside Diego, containing the HP stolen from the Target. All souls jars can only be retrieved by allied champions, and remain unobtainable to Both Diego and Enemy champions.\r\nMana cost: 200 \r\ncool down: 25 seconds\r\ndamage/health: 150 health (inital), +50 every upgrade \r\n\r\nW-&quot;Wing man&quot;/ &quot;Encouraging bad habits&quot;\r\n\r\nAfter selecting an allied champion or an area (marked with a small radius), Diego will hurl a Bottle of his finest &quot;Malvado Golden mane&quot; Whiskey at them, covering the individual or space with the glowing golden Liquor. Allies directly struck with the bottle will receive a 4 second speed increase and +50 % for their next two strikes. Enemies struck with the attack will slowed for 1.5-2 seconds, while finding them selves being force to walk towards Diego against their will. \r\nMana Cost: 150\r\nCool down: 30 seconds\r\ndamage: 50 (enemy champions only)\r\n\r\nE- &quot;Diego&#039;s lovely Escort service&quot;\r\n\r\nAfter selecting a target, Diego will dismounting of the several soul jars on his belt and pop open the cork, letting a ghost of female cabaret dance out to terrorize or aid champions until her bar of Health is diminished (250hp). When Diego unleashes &quot;Helen&quot; onto an ally, the spirit will circle around them, dealing damage to minions and intercepting enemy champion&#039;s attack until destroyed. When unleashed upon opposing champions, the spirit will circle around them a expose their position as they try to retreat out of sight or hide in bushes, increasing all damage dealt to the target enemy by 10% until destroyed. Should Diego cast the spell on himself, He will take three bottles from his belt and release three female spirits (each containing 80 hp each), who will circle around him increasing  the recharge of his health and mana by 3.5% and auto-attack enemies within melee range until destroyed.\r\n\r\nMana cost: 300\r\ncool down: 50 seconds\r\n\r\nR: &quot;the Taste that raises the Dead&quot;\r\n\r\nIf Diego is quick to react in wake of a dying allied champion, He will retrieve the small bottle dangling from his neck and pour a drop into a &quot;Golden mane&quot; whiskey bottle (taking about 4 seconds) before hurling it at the dead ally. As the bottle shatters and soaks the friendly champion in the Liquor, they will find them selves returning to life with 800 hp (+20 per level up) and half their mana restored. Diego is also able to cast the spell on himself, however, there is a 10 second window after dying where he is able to activate the ability.\r\n\r\n\r\nDialogue:\r\n\r\nSelection:\r\n-&quot;I&#039;ll make em dance&quot;\r\n\r\nSpawning in:\r\n-&quot;Wonder what their souls will taste like&quot;\r\n-&quot;Free whiskey, for anyone who can down a bottle in one go&quot;\r\n-&quot;I don&#039;t condone Violence...

Having such a prestigious life, Diego&#039;s natural talent for tinkering and business was immedatly recognised when they surfaced in his early age, resulting in his proud parent enrolling him in one of Piltover&#039;s renown laboratories academia for when he grew into a man. Though his intellect would never be used for continuing on the family legacy as they would hope, Diego&#039;s destiny revealing it&#039;s self to him on the day he found himself lost in the underground city of Zaun. After taking the wrong tram home, Diego was thrusted into the distinctive and highly industry world of the under city, though while most Piltoveren would be completely disgusted by such a harsh introduction to the world below their feet, Diego found himself enthralled. The lights, the sounds, the durability of it&#039;s citizens and visions of endless possibility, all these sight drew a grin on the teenage diego&#039;s face. Losing track of time, Diego would end up spending a night in the undercity, happily falling asleep in a dark alley. It was in this night, Diego discovered his first love and the event which would set him down the path of becoming the man he was today. She was one of the most beautiful things he had ever laid eyes upon, though she was covered in soote and her dress was practically a ragged mess, her green eyes and dark skin took his soul instantly. The girl was also infatuated with Diego, he was refined and his fancy words swept off her feet. One night soon became weeks As Diego surrendered himself to Zuan, learning how to survive in the harsh under city, even forming his own gang which boasted success like none other. But horror would soon cross his destiny. Returning to the Alley where they had first met, Diego and his love planned on a great romance they hoped to have in the future, though this time they weren&#039;t alone in the alley. From the shadows stepped a well dressed man wearing an unnatural grin, At first he was polite, begging sorry  for the disturbance he has cause, then the man demanded the girl soul, drawing Diego to charge at him with a blade, But it was too late...The man cackled and slurked into the shadows, leaving Diego to turn back to his love and find her motionless on the floor.  There was no scares, no bruises, not even a mark as Diego cradled her filled with tears, her dark skin now paler than usual and her green eyes nothing by empty white glasses. \r\n\r\nFilled with new purpose, Diego returned home a man, one burning with a clear mission. He took what he could of his inheritance and went back down into Zaun, Buying an old factory no one wanted. Paying generously, Loyal workers rushed to his doors and the first batch of &quot;malvado&#039;s&quot; beer was sold two weeks later. Becoming the drink of common zaunites, the Brand grew into stardom as Diego funded trips to other nations, learning new techniques and tastes until he perfected his own, secretly improved by his dark secret. His love of science and gadgets never died, only given direction as he begun an unhealthy obsession with the dark magic of soul stealing, the curse which took his love away. As the brewery grew, so did Diego&#039;s hidden experiments, finding himself stalking the lonely alleys of zaun at night, hunting gangsters and thieves to fuel his tests and liquor, discovering that the more corrupt the individual, the more sweet the taste it would provide. \r\n\r\nLike the man his family foreseen, Diego grew into an powerful overlord of commerce, while his experimental genius of mixing magic and science remained a secret. After many years of amassing wealth and wooing hearts, horror would strike again. News of women and children being murdered began reaching the news, quickly becoming pandemonium as several pale corpse with pale eyes would be found every morning. Convinced it was that man from years ago, Diego would also venture into the city at night, attempting prevent the murders. Sometimes he was able to fight of the Strange shadow man, and sometimes he was to late, bottling the victims souls to prevent the shadow man from consuming them, hoping to find a way to revive them. But when news of similar murders began appearing in Piltover, Diego was determined to end the threat for good.  \r\n\r\nIn the highest of a grim night, the two encountered one another in a lovely garden plaza, At first the shadow man toyed with Diego, avoiding strikes and focus on infuriating him. Adsorbed in his fury He failed to see the trap laid out for, becoming more aggressive and violent as he hope to kill the pest for good. Once the shadow man saw Diego was completely clouded by anger, the evil demon released a captive he had been hiding. It was a young Piltover woman, lost and afraid as she emerged from the monster&#039;s shadows, letting out a deafening scream  as Diego struck her with his soul stealing rope dart. As his eyes widen with horror and regret, the beast disappeared into the night, leaving Diego to yet again cradle a lifeless woman in his arms. Though this time...he was determined to not let her pass on. Spurned on by determination and crying with regret, Diego desperately tried to force the dead woman to drink her own soul, readying her lips to pour the essence back into her body...though this was the last thing Diego would see that night as a Loud rifle shot would break the silence and shatter the top of Diego&#039;s head wide open....the world went dark.\r\n\r\nHours past until Diego re-awoke, find himself in the same plaza as before, only, piece of his head where laid scattered on the floor. Was he dead? He glances at the empty soul jar in his hand and realised what had happened, He had found a way to cheat death...but at what cost? the life of an innocent. Scrabbling back to his brewer, Diego saw what remain of his head in a mirror, founding it chilling to see half his face torn of and the inner muscles glowing with an eerie blue aura. He would recover, Replacing the missing bone and flesh with a steel construct, returning his sight to him through dark magic. Finally understanding his enemy, Diego would return to his mission with a new drive.","replies":[{"poster":"SEKAI","date":"2017-03-09T14:55:54.834+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I know you've poured much effort and pieces of yourself into this creation, and thematically, it does look promising.\n\nThough I must say, kit wise, it can be designed better.\n\nThis kit suffers a couple problems, or more specifically, over-budgeting of pros and cons.\n\nLike, this guy's abilities are seriously insanely good, and just like his pros, his downside are mostly incredibly handsome with CD towering as high as 50seconds which is just insane. On a general scale, this guy already doesn't pass because he just won't work in the environment of League with this kind of power and CD setup.\n\n.................\n\nBut we can try dissecting the content of his kits:\n\n* That Passive is essentially Taric's ulti on a 10 second CD with no cost. It's just way too much. It needs to be changed or tuned down.\n\n* Q seems an okay concept (though I'd say changing up the interaction from forming a \"bond\", it's probably a bit overused by now), but I would suggest the \"jar\" is also retrievable by enemies. I mean, it's now a soul in a jar that whoever consumes it gets healed slightly, it's fair game for everyone with only the possible exception of the Diego himself for obvious reasons, so enemies should also be able to pick them jars up unless one of them is also a Diego. Lower the CD, it doesn't deserve to be that high.\n\n* W, I suppose it's cool as a concept, it reminds me a bit of TF2's Jarate where the Sniper throws jars of his own piss/urine at people, which would debuff the enemy players, though can also be used on allies for positive effects like dousing fire/burning from Pyro's flamethrower (I'm guessing this ability was taking inspirations from that considering you went so far to emphasise that it's \"golden\")? But here's the issue, it does too much. It does potentially 4 things with each cast, 2 on allies and 2 on enemies, make it 2 normal effects or 3 weaker effects at max; CD can also be lowered.\n\n* E is a mess, imo. Assuming it goes by the rechargeable ammunition rule for his jars of ghosts, each ghosts have 250HP (which is very high for disposable debuff minions) that debuffs the enemies by making them more vulnerable to pokes (10% extra damage at that) on top of denying them to withdraw and hide in brush or something in order to deal with the ghosts, and so they are forced to completely disengage. This mirrors if not better than Illaoi's E, the most over-budgeted normal spell (by itself) in the entire game. But wait, there's more, which it can also be used as general performance buffs for allies too, that lasts possibly permanently until removed via killing the ghosts. Even without considering how the jars are recharged and whether or not the effects stack upon multiple casts, this is already very seriously overloaded. I really would like you to take this back onto the drawing board and decide which one is more integral to the champ's identity and make a decision to keep some parts of it while discarding the remaining, because as it stands, I don't think Diego can't have all of that in the same ability. Sure it's on an extreme CD of 50 seconds, I see you trying to balance the pros out, but it's just not healthy in the context of League with this kind of approach in design. Trim it down, and lower the CD.\n\n* While thematically R seems like a pretty fun time, and it really is depiction wise, but the execution wise it's like a better version of Zilean's ultimate tbh, which isn't really that convincing tbh. And even if we do let it pass under the consideration of its preparation time and vulnerability during that said process and pretense that it's only usable in almost or just within melee range or something like that, the second half of that ability doesn't seem to be that sound because if Diego is knocked out, it would be impossible for him to mix and sniff an \"energy\" liquid; it would be far more plausible if it's said that Diego could choose to use the sniffy on himself if he'd died after completing the mixture without already using it on someone else (in this case, it would mean the liquid exists for a period of time after being made, let's make it 5 seconds or something, and CD only starts clocking after it's used or tossed away). Also you might want to rebalance the HP, it would be better to use %HP instead because that stat that's currently there would more or less mean reviving squishes back to almost full and tanks just enough to be killed again right after revival.\n\n.................\n\nThis is just my opinion on the kits of Diego. I can be wrong in all of this.","replies":[]}]}
