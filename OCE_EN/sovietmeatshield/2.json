Preferring to harass his victims \r\n                                   until submission,  Moelock is able to let out a continuous stream of bullets, pausing between shots to pump another round into the \r\n                                   firing chamber (taking 0.10-0.20 seconds for the lever to load another round). When in combat, the Poacher uses two types of  \r\n                                   ammunition to capture his victims, The &quot;Bushshot&quot; and &quot;Wallop&quot; rounds, which Moelock can switch between any time during a battle \r\n                                   to better adapt to the situation at hand; though it takes a moment for Moelock to switch ammunition type (taking  2-3 secondsto load \r\n                                    new rounds into his rifle). Both type of rounds have distinctive uses during a fight and have varying effects on enemies when in use.\r\n\r\n                                   **_&quot;Bush&quot; shot_**-Perfect for dealing with crowds, these 8 gauge rounds unleashes a furious burst of rubber buckshot ,   \r\n                                                                       spraying 3 large pellets towards enemies (caught within a cone radius damage zone). Having a constant barrage \r\n                                                                       of Bush shot savagely bashing against their flesh, victim find themselves stumbling and their momentum hindered \r\n                                                                       (minions are slowed for 2 seconds upon initial impact, while enemies champions are slowed down for 3-4 \r\n                                                                        seconds after two direct shots)      \r\n\r\n                                       **_Wallop&quot; shot_** - A brutal 12 gauge rubber slug, this round  was designed to render it&#039;s prey unconscious or heavily dazed when \r\n                                                                               shot with it. With double the range of it&#039;s cousin shell and capable of greater accuracy, Wallop rounds are \r\n                                                                               ideal for catching prey. Bashing into it&#039;s victim upon impact, it leaves enemies completely stunned (minions  \r\n                                                                               are stunned upon impact for 2 Seconds, Champions require three direct shots to be stunned for 3 seconds), \r\n                                                                               allowing the hunter to catch up or deal more damaging blows with ease. It should be noted however that \r\n                                                                               enemies begin to build a resistance towards Wallop rounds if they managed to snap out of their dazed state, \r\n                                                                                making it difficult to stun them again for awhile (10 seconds of re-stun immunity)\r\n\r\n(visual Idea base for &quot;Bushman&#039;s rifle&quot;: http://www.taylorsfirearms.com/media/catalog/category/1887-Lever-Action-Shotgun-1280.jpg, http://www.extravaganzi.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/Briggs-Patent-Henry-Rifle.jpg. )\r\n\r\n**Q-Poacher&#039;s friend/Talos Chop:**\r\nAfter selecting a target, Moelock barks out the order to his loyal hunting Hound Talos, who charges forward and sinks her jaws onto the target&#039;s leg or other limb. Wrestling with the prey, Talos ensures that her victim remains grounded and vulnerable to all attacks, rendering the captured enemy helpless for 4 seconds; Giving the perfect opportunity for Moelock or an allied champion to deal out devastating blows while they are locked in place.\r\n(concept for Talos: https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/564x/72/d8/50/72d85023bfb85159c36513a68e72ede8.jpg )\r\n\r\n**W-Half Time orange:*\r\nAlways willing to lend a team mate a hand, Moelock tosses a juicy orange to them for a quick snack, negating any enemy de-buffs which are plaguing them.\r\nInstantly curing them from Stuns, Slowed, entrapments or damage nerfs that are effecting them while also giving them a small amount of health  (+50-+100). When Moelock improves this ability, he is able to toss two oranges to two different team mates at the same time.\r\nor\r\n\r\n**W-Barbecue Bait:**\r\nUpon selecting a location, Moelock Reaches into his ammunition&#039;s pouch and takes out a chunk of raw meat which he tosses forward, causing all nearby foes to be immediately drawn to it (minions all horde around the piece of meat for 8 seconds,). Anything that walks into or is caught within the Bait&#039;s &quot;smell&quot; radius starts gravitating towards the tossed bait until it finally decays (after 10 seconds) , until that time however all enemy champions who find themselves trapped by the bait, cannot help by to helplessly wander toward the bait for 6 seconds. \r\n\r\n**E-Rescue Dog:**\r\nSeeing an teammate in a dire situation, whether it be them surrounded by minions and enemy champions or critical low on health in the middle of a battlefield, Moelock his able to &quot;mark&quot; them and Let out a deafening whistle, causing his Talos to rush forward and grab a hold of the endangered teammate, quickly dragging to a safe distance (either behind Moelock or out of the enemies reach).  Once Talos takes a grip onto her extraction target, the allied champion become immune to damage for 5 seconds as they are being dragged to safety.\r\n\r\n**R-Bush Tackle/Bush juggernaut:**\r\nActivating the attack, Summoners choose a line of attack and then allow the carnage to unfold. Working himself up into a focused frenzy, Like after drinking a couple of pints at the local pub, Moelock throws down his hunting rifle and roars a volley on insults toward the enemy, finally physicking himself up (after 2 seconds) into a Ballistic charge forward. Savagely shoulder barging through hordes of minions, who bounce off him like rubber balls against concrete walls as he tear through them. Should an enemy Champion come into contact with the raging mad man, they are brutally spear tackled, slamming them into the ground with a horrifying force which leaves them completely stunned (for 8 seconds). Any other enemy champion who find themselves nearby are effected by a small shock wave coming from the harsh tackle, Slowing them down for 4 seconds, allowing allied champions to gain an advantage. At the end of the attack, Moelock is stunned for 2 seconds, recovering from his made charge as his hound Talos brings over his Rifle.\r\n\r\nSpeech:\r\n\r\nSelection:\r\n-&quot;Time to bushwhack some Knackers&quot; \r\n\r\nWhen spawning:\r\n-&quot;Righto then!

I got bickies!&quot;(successful)\r\n-&quot;Quick stretch, now wheres the pub?&quot;\r\n\r\nLore:\r\n\r\nSon of a Notorious outlaw, Moelock grew up on a struggling farm under the guidance of his mother, who was a tough woman that came from generations of stubborn farmers. Spending most of his child hood helping to do the heavy lifting  at the dying family farm, Moelock build himself up to be strong and quickly learned how to hunt since it was the only source of food, as the Farm&#039;s land were practically dust fields and dead earth. Cherishing the little that he grew up with, Moelock often fantasied about becoming a law man and to bring justice to those who needed it, enjoying the various gold coin novels his mother would read to him. This obsession with justice carried on throughout Moelock&#039;s life, however, his distinctive &quot;moral code&quot; would only manifest years later when his farther returned home. Having disappeared for decades, his farther arrived at the front door one afternoon, though it was not a pleasant reunion as The man had come back with his gang of thugs, looking for a stash of gold he had buried there before he left. After a harsh argument and brutal fight, Moelock and his mother we knocked unconscious, while his farther took the treasure he had came for, burning anything that had managed to thrive on their desolate farm. with not home, their livestock slaughtered or stolen, Moelock and his mother were driven into destitute and forces to migrate from town to town committing petty thefts and heists to survive, that day of infamy burning away at the back of his mind. \r\n\r\nFinally becoming a man, Moelock signed up for the Piltover law enforcement, however, after becoming a deputy, he quickly realised that this was not the form of &ldquo;justice&rdquo; he had envisioned. Moelock was more than happy to help bring down big time crooks and murderers, however, when it came to those who committed illegal acts out of desperation and the need for survival, Moelock often went against order, unable to bring himself those people to jail where they would only suffer more. Fleeing from this duty, Moelock started to wonder through kingdom to kingdom for three years, doing odd jobs and learning various skills, until one day, a bounty hunter dragged a corpse through town. Intrigued, Moelock followed the hunter and ask as many questions as he could via a friendly conversation, Sparking his interest in Bounty hunting. Wasting no more time, Moelock quit his current blacksmithing job, bought a hunting hound and built a hunting rifle (which was clunky yet reliable), before strolling up to the message board and taking the most difficult bounty on offer, vowing to take the target in alive despite veterans of the trade trying to dissuade him from doing so. After three days, Moelock returns with the Bandit tied up and slung over his shoulders, earning is first bounty and scare.\r\nHaving now found his dream line of work, Moelock set off across the world once more, taking all daring bounties he could find and successfully bring every single one of them back alive, no matter how hard they roughed him up in a fight (earning more money than any other hunter in the process). After being a successful bounty hunter for nearly a decade, Moelock slowly began to realise the flaws of being a bounty hunter, realising that they never took up any causes and only took up bounties worth their while, ignoring missions which truly benefited people in need. Changing his line of work yet again, Moelock started travelling around in search of places which desperately need help and requires with his &ldquo;Know how&rdquo; to solve their problems. While he became a popular folk hero in some parts, /Moelock&rsquo;s funds quickly burnt out, running out of the cash he had amounted earlier, by constantly giving it away to people he thought needed it more, the hunter found himself joining mercenary groups and gangs of robbers. Though never breaking from his morale code, which was now set in steel, he would only plague his service to those he thought up hold the moral high ground in the situation, which wasn&rsquo;t always on the side of law. Hoping through all lines of hired gun work, Moelock became legendary for his impressive skills, unrivalled experience keen wit, unbeat demeanour, sailor&rsquo;s mouth, dark humour and tendency to look on the Brightside, but most of all Moelock is renowned for his uncompromising  determination to bring his enemies back alive, believing true justice is served when the &ldquo;irredeemable scum&rdquo; in left to rot in a dungeon for the rest of their life, stating &ldquo;that way they suffer more.&rdquo;","replies":[]}
