Taking up any bounty or task which gives him the opportunity to bring those he calls &quot;irredeemable Scum&quot;, even if the rewards is a mere single gold coin.

Preferring to harass his victims until submission, Moelock is able to let out a continuous stream of bullets, pausing between shots to pump another round into the firing chamber (taking 0.10-0.20 seconds for the lever to load another round). When in combat, the Poacher uses two types of ammunition to capture his victims, The &quot;Bushshot&quot; and &quot;Wallop&quot; rounds, which Moelock can switch between any time during a battle\nto better adapt to the situation at hand; though it takes a moment for Moelock to switch ammunition type (taking 2-3 seconds to load new rounds into his rifle). Both type of rounds have distinctive uses during a fight and have varying effects on enemies when in use.\n\n&quot;Bush&quot; shot-Perfect for dealing with crowds, these 8 gauge rounds unleashes a furious burst of rubber buckshot ,spraying 3 large pellets towards enemies (caught within a cone radius damage zone). Having a constant barrage of Bush shot savagely bashing against their flesh, victim find themselves stumbling and their momentum hindered (minions are slowed for 2 seconds upon initial impact, while enemies champions are slowed down for 3-4\nseconds after two direct shots)\n\nWallop&quot; shot - A brutal 12 gauge rubber slug, this round was designed to render it&#039;s prey unconscious or heavily dazed when shot with it. With double the range of it&#039;s cousin shell and capable of greater accuracy, Wallop rounds are ideal for catching prey. Bashing into it&#039;s victim upon impact, it leaves enemies completely stunned (minions are stunned upon impact for 2 Seconds, Champions require three direct shots to be stunned for 3 seconds), allowing the hunter to catch up or deal more damaging blows with ease. It should be noted however that\nenemies begin to build a resistance towards Wallop rounds if they managed to snap out of their dazed state,\nmaking it difficult to stun them again for awhile (10 seconds of re-stun immunity)\n\n(visual Idea base for &quot;Bushman&#039;s rifle&quot;: http://www.taylorsfirearms.com/media/catalog/category/1887-Lever-Action-Shotgun-1280.jpg, http://www.extravaganzi.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/Briggs-Patent-Henry-Rifle.jpg. )\n\nQ-Poacher&#039;s friend/Talos Chop:\nAfter selecting a target, Moelock barks out the order to his loyal hunting Hound Talos, who charges forward and sinks her jaws onto the target&#039;s leg or other limb. Wrestling with the prey, Talos ensures that her victim remains grounded and vulnerable to all attacks, rendering the captured enemy helpless for 2 seconds; Giving the perfect opportunity for Moelock or an allied champion to deal out devastating blows while they are locked in place.\n(concept for Talos: https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/564x/72/d8/50/72d85023bfb85159c36513a68e72ede8.jpg )\n\n*W-Half Time orange:\nAlways willing to lend a team mate a hand, Moelock tosses a juicy orange to them for a quick snack, negating any enemy de-buffs which are plaguing them.\nInstantly curing them from Stuns, Slowed, entrapments or damage nerfs that are effecting them while also giving them a small amount of health (+50-+100). When Moelock improves this ability, he is able to toss two oranges to two different team mates at the same time.\nor\n\nW-Barbecue Bait:\nUpon selecting a location, Moelock Reaches into his ammunition&#039;s pouch and takes out a chunk of raw meat which he tosses forward, causing all nearby foes to be immediately drawn to it (minions all horde around the piece of meat for 5 seconds,). Anything that walks into or is caught within the Bait&#039;s &quot;smell&quot; radius starts gravitating towards the tossed bait until it finally decays (after 10 seconds) , until that time however all enemy champions who find themselves trapped by the bait, cannot help by to helplessly wander toward the bait for 3 seconds.\n\nE-Rescue Dog:\nSeeing an teammate in a dire situation, whether it be them surrounded by minions and enemy champions or critical low on health in the middle of a battlefield, Moelock his able to &quot;mark&quot; them and Let out a deafening whistle, causing his Talos to rush forward and grab a hold of the endangered teammate, quickly dragging to a safe distance (either behind Moelock or out of the enemies reach). Once Talos takes a grip onto her extraction target, the allied champion become immune to damage for 5 seconds as they are being dragged to safety.\n\nR-Bush Tackle/Bush juggernaut:\nActivating the attack, Summoners choose a line of attack and then allow the carnage to unfold. Working himself up into a focused frenzy, Like after drinking a couple of pints at the local pub, Moelock throws down his hunting rifle and roars a volley on insults toward the enemy, finally physicking himself up (after 2 seconds) into a Ballistic charge forward. Savagely shoulder barging through hordes of minions, who bounce off him like rubber balls against concrete walls as he tear through them. Should an enemy Champion come into contact with the raging mad man, they are brutally spear tackled, slamming them into the ground with a horrifying force which leaves them completely stunned (for 4 seconds). Any other enemy champion who find themselves nearby are effected by a small shock wave coming from the harsh tackle, Slowing them down for 4 seconds, allowing allied champions to gain an advantage. At the end of the attack, Moelock is stunned for 2 seconds, recovering from his made charge as his hound Talos brings over his Rifle.\n\nSpeech:\n\nSelection:\n-&quot;Time to bushwhack some Knackers&quot;\n\nWhen spawning:\n-&quot;Righto then!

Spending most of his child hood helping to do the heavy lifting at the dying family farm, Moelock build himself up to be strong and quickly learned how to hunt since it was the only source of food, as the Farm&#039;s land were practically dust fields and dead earth. Cherishing the little that he grew up with, Moelock often fantasied about becoming a law man and to bring justice to those who needed it, enjoying the various gold coin novels his mother would read to him. This obsession with justice carried on throughout Moelock&#039;s life, however, his distinctive &quot;moral code&quot; would only manifest years later when his farther returned home. Having disappeared for decades, his farther arrived at the front door one afternoon, though it was not a pleasant reunion as The man had come back with his gang of thugs, looking for a stash of gold he had buried there before he left. After a harsh argument and brutal fight, Moelock and his mother we knocked unconscious, while his farther took the treasure he had came for, burning anything that had managed to thrive on their desolate farm. with not home, their livestock slaughtered or stolen, Moelock and his mother were driven into destitute and forces to migrate from town to town committing petty thefts and heists to survive, that day of infamy burning away at the back of his mind.\n\nFinally becoming a man, Moelock signed up for the Piltover law enforcement, however, after becoming a deputy, he quickly realised that this was not the form of &ldquo;justice&rdquo; he had envisioned. Moelock was more than happy to help bring down big time crooks and murderers, however, when it came to those who committed illegal acts out of desperation and the need for survival, Moelock often went against order, unable to bring himself those people to jail where they would only suffer more. Fleeing from this duty, Moelock started to wonder through kingdom to kingdom for three years, doing odd jobs and learning various skills, until one day, a bounty hunter dragged a corpse through town. Intrigued, Moelock followed the hunter and ask as many questions as he could via a friendly conversation, Sparking his interest in Bounty hunting. Wasting no more time, Moelock quit his current blacksmithing job, bought a hunting hound and built a hunting rifle (which was clunky yet reliable), before strolling up to the message board and taking the most difficult bounty on offer, vowing to take the target in alive despite veterans of the trade trying to dissuade him from doing so. After three days, Moelock returns with the Bandit tied up and slung over his shoulders, earning is first bounty and scare.\nHaving now found his dream line of work, Moelock set off across the world once more, taking all daring bounties he could find and successfully bring every single one of them back alive, no matter how hard they roughed him up in a fight (earning more money than any other hunter in the process). After being a successful bounty hunter for nearly a decade, Moelock slowly began to realise the flaws of being a bounty hunter, realising that they never took up any causes and only took up bounties worth their while, ignoring missions which truly benefited people in need. Changing his line of work yet again, Moelock started travelling around in search of places which desperately need help and requires with his &ldquo;Know how&rdquo; to solve their problems. While he became a popular folk hero in some parts, /Moelock&rsquo;s funds quickly burnt out, running out of the cash he had amounted earlier, by constantly giving it away to people he thought needed it more, the hunter found himself joining mercenary groups and gangs of robbers. Though never breaking from his morale code, which was now set in steel, he would only plague his service to those he thought up hold the moral high ground in the situation, which wasn&rsquo;t always on the side of law. Hoping through all lines of hired gun work, Moelock became legendary for his impressive skills, unrivalled experience keen wit, unbeat demeanour, sailor&rsquo;s mouth, dark humour and tendency to look on the Brightside, but most of all Moelock is renowned for his uncompromising determination to bring his enemies back alive, believing true justice is served when the &ldquo;irredeemable scum&rdquo; in left to rot in a dungeon for the rest of their life, stating &ldquo;that way they suffer more.&rdquo;","replies":[{"poster":"LittleBlueSenpai","date":"2017-02-16T23:12:06.964+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"2 thoughts; first of all the bait thing seems little OP, 3 second cc is a little too much, I think 1.5-2 seconds would be best considering the rest of though I prefur the half time orange a lot more, his E they should only be immune to cc and disables imo","replies":[{"poster":"Sovietmeatshield","date":"2017-02-21T05:20:55.439+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Cheers for the feed back, made some alterations to the character. \n\nThe \"Bushman's\" rifle:\n\n\"Bush\" shot: Perfect for dealing with crowds, these 8 gauge rounds unleashes a furious burst of rubber buckshot ,spraying 3 large pellets towards enemies (caught within a cone radius damage zone). Having a constant barrage of Bush shot savagely bashing against their flesh, victim find themselves stumbling and dazed (minions are stunned for 2 seconds upon initial impact, while enemies champions are slowed down for 3\nseconds after two full volley direct shots) . Designed to disarm and weaken prey rather than completely subdue, Bush shot can exhaust targets (It is able to eat away at enemy champion's Health points), however it will never be capable of killing ( It will be able to slay minions, but once enemy champions reach 20 point of health, Moelock's Bush shot will be incapable of dealing anymore damage).\n\"Wallop\" shot: A brutal 12 gauge rubber slug, this round was designed to render it's prey unconscious when shot with it. Having double the range of it's cousin shell and capable of greater accuracy, Wallop rounds are ideal for catching prey and sending them into a pain induced nightmare as Moelock drags them to the nearest \"Locker house\". Bashing into it's victim upon impact, it leaves enemies disoriented (minions are stunned upon impact for 2 Seconds, Champions are slowed for 1.5 seconds on the first shot ), allowing the hunter to catch up or deal more damaging blows with ease. Though this is not the only advantage of Moelock's \"Wallop\" Round, as the Infamous poach cleverly embedded a unique scent onto each rubber slug bullet, which splashes onto target when hit, allowing Talos to keep a \"scent\" of target should they decide to flee out of sight (Passive- \"Poacher's trick\"- enemy champions hit with \"Wallop\" shots will remain visible to Molelock and allies in the fog of war for 10 seconds). It should be noted , that due to the heavy calibre of the bullet , more pore is required to fire this kind of shell, which puts slightly more strain on the rifle's lever action, taking more time to reload between shots (taking 0.30 seconds to load a new shell each pull of the trigger).\n\nChanges to Kit\n\nE-Rescue Dog:\n\nSeeing an teammate in a dire situation, whether it be them surrounded by minions and enemy champions or critical low on health in the middle of a battlefield, Moelock his able to \"mark\" them and let out a deafening whistle, causing his Talos to rush forward and grab a hold of the endangered teammate, quickly dragging to a safe distance (either behind Moelock or out of the enemies reach). Once Talos takes a grip onto her extraction target, the allied champion become immune to damage for 5 seconds as they are being dragged to safety, however, as a cost for this helpful spell, all damage dealt on the allied champion transfers directly onto Moelock. Should Moelock's \"threshold for pain\" be beaten (his health 0) be broken, the rescue will immedatly be halted as Talos will desperately run beside her fallen master, though for his sacrifice the ally he attempted to save will receive a small fraction of health (50p) to give them a small, put fighting chance.\n\nR-Bushman's last stand:\n\nWhen all hope his lost, Moelock still won't go down without a fight...or quietly. Should things turn for the worst for Moelock and his allies, he will must up all the rage he has buried under that upbeat grin throughout all his years of wondering and unleash a deafening war cry which \"radiates\" the area (forming a large radius of \"Bush\" aura). Pounding his chest with a courageous insanity, Moelock will lock his feet into the ground, wield his rifle in one had while drawing a rusty revolver in the other, Barraging the attacking enemy with insults as he blast them with a stream of rubbers bullets, allowing all allied champions to flee safely while he stay behind to die in their place. (All Enemy champions will trapped inside the highlighted circle, while all friendly champions are launched backwards to safety). No damage will occur to allied champions, as all attacks are immedatly drawn and inflicted to Moelock within the \"bush aura\" circle. Despite firing like a mad man and inflicting 50% less damage, Moelock is unable to kill any enemy champion trapped inside his \"aura\" . Lasting for 10 seconds, Moelock's last stand ensure allied escape at the expense of Moelock's demise, to compensate for this enemy champions will receive only half of the experience and gold upon slaying him.\n\nNew Speech:\n\n-\"Ouch!

I mean even malzahar and warwick have to stick that on their ult, and warwick's is a skillshot. Then you have the choice of free cleanses for your team with his first w, which is completely broken. Or a ranged, and much safer galio ult on his w, granted without the same levels of damage but 8s more than over compensates this, making this a stronger version of galio ult... on a basic ability. E is a thresh lantern combined with kayle ult. Two signature abilities, both being abilities that had shifted alot of their respective champions power allowance into their utility, and again, an ultimate... on a basic ability. \n\nAnd then we have his ult, which is probably the least stupidly overpowered ability that was put into his kit, but still being equivalent to a sion or kled ult, albiet with a fairly long cast time, but compensated with not being at all single target and a dumb 8s stun. 8s is not a reasonable number. Also let's not forget his passive, which gives his autos a slow, which doesn't sound too impactful until you realise the only other auto attack slow passive on an adc, ashe's frost shot consumed a large portion of her kit's power, with the rest going into her q and ult, but the passive slow is incredibely passive. Also the other option is a 3hit braum passive, instead of a 4hit one.\n\nWhy can't anybody ever give a fanmade champion concept, a semi-balanced, or even slightly underpowered kit. Why does it always have to be so overpowered. Looking at overloaded, overpowered kits and imagining them in the game isn't fun. Also the kit doesn't have syndergy with itself, like his ultimate is a very upclose and personal kind of thing, suggesting tanky ad sup, but his q, w and e suggest backline ranged poke sup, whereas his passive suggests short range graves type of champion. It's not consistent.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Sovietmeatshield","date":"2017-02-19T11:20:44.863+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Update:\n\nThe \"Bushman's\" rifle:\n                                      \n                                     ** \"Bush\" shot:** Perfect for dealing with crowds, these 8 gauge rounds unleashes a furious burst of rubber buckshot ,spraying 3 large pellets towards enemies (caught within a cone radius damage zone). Having a constant barrage of Bush shot savagely bashing against their flesh, victim find themselves stumbling and dazed **(minions are stunned for 2 seconds upon initial impact, while enemies champions are slowed down for 3\nseconds after two full volley direct shots) .**  Designed to disarm and weaken prey rather than completely subdue, Bush shot can exhaust targets (It is able to eat away at enemy champion's Health points), however it will never be capable of killing **( It will be able to slay minions, but once enemy champions reach 20 point of health, Moelock's Bush shot will be incapable of dealing anymore damage).\n**\n                                     ** \"Wallop\" shot:**  A brutal 12 gauge rubber slug, this round was designed to render it's prey unconscious when shot with it. Having double the range of it's cousin shell and capable of greater accuracy, Wallop rounds are ideal for catching prey and  sending them into a pain induced nightmare as Moelock drags them to the nearest \"Locker house\". Bashing into it's victim upon impact, it leaves enemies disoriented (minions are stunned upon impact for 2 Seconds, Champions are slowed for 1.5 seconds on the first shot ), allowing the hunter to catch up or deal more damaging blows with ease. Though this is not the only advantage of Moelock's \"Wallop\" Round, as the Infamous poach cleverly embedded a unique scent onto each rubber slug bullet, which splashes onto target when hit, allowing Talos to keep a \"scent\" of target should they decide to flee out of sight **(Passive- \"Poacher's trick\"- enemy champions hit with \"Wallop\" shots will remain visible to Molelock and allies in the fog of war for 10 seconds).** It should be noted , that due to the heavy calibre of the bullet , more pore is required to fire this kind of shell, which puts slightly more strain on the rifle's lever action, taking more time to reload between shots (taking 0.30 seconds to load a new shell each pull of the trigger).  \n\n\n\n**Changes to Kit**\n\nE-Rescue Dog:\n\nSeeing an teammate in a dire situation, whether it be them surrounded by minions and enemy champions or critical low on health in the middle of a battlefield, Moelock his able to \"mark\" them and let out a deafening whistle, causing his Talos to rush forward and grab a hold of the endangered teammate, quickly dragging to a safe distance (either behind Moelock or out of the enemies reach). Once Talos takes a grip onto her extraction target, the allied champion become immune to damage for** 5 seconds** as they are being dragged to safety, however, as a cost for this helpful spell, **all damage dealt** on the allied champion **transfers directly onto Moelock**. Should Moelock's \"threshold for pain\" be beaten (his health 0) be broken, the rescue will immedatly be halted as Talos will desperately run beside her fallen master, though for his sacrifice the ally he attempted to save will receive a small fraction of health (50p) to give them a small, put fighting chance.\n\n**R-Bushman's last stand**:\n\nWhen all hope his lost, Moelock still won't go down without a fight...or quietly. Should things turn for the worst  for Moelock and his allies, he will must up all the rage he has buried under that upbeat grin throughout all his years of wondering and unleash a deafening war cry which \"radiates\" the area (forming a large radius of \"Bush\" aura). Pounding his chest with a courageous insanity, Moelock will lock his feet into the ground, wield his rifle in one had while drawing a rusty revolver in the other, Barraging the attacking enemy with insults as he blast them with a stream of rubbers bullets, allowing all allied champions to flee safely while he stay behind to die in their place. (All Enemy champions will trapped inside the highlighted circle, while all friendly champions are launched backwards to safety). No damage will occur to allied champions, as all attacks are immedatly drawn and inflicted to Moelock within the \"bush aura\" circle. Despite firing like a mad man and inflicting 50% less damage, Moelock is unable to kill any enemy champion trapped inside his \"aura\" . Lasting for 10 seconds, Moelock's last stand ensure allied escape at the expense of Moelock's demise, to compensate for this enemy champions will receive only half of the experience and gold upon slaying him.\n\nNew Speech:\n\n-\"Ouch!
