Load up a custom game, and when the screen goes black, try pressing the \"return\" (or enter) key on your keyboard and see if it loads.\n2. Try changing your DNS settings following [this guide](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues#mq4), and try loading into a custom game again and see if the problem is resolved.\n3. Attempt to repair the client using [this guide](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201761974#mq6) and try again.\n\nLet me know if any of those steps worked for you or if you have any other questions.","replies":[]}]}
