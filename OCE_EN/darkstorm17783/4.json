Like i dont see any counter play to being one hit by a tank, like how do you deal with this in solo queue when everyone is out for their own scores? Please higher elo senpai&#039;s teach me","replies":[{"poster":"Ingénue","date":"2016-03-05T08:16:00.842+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Best thing to do is to try to build to fight the tanks.\n\nThis means informing your team to build anti-tank items. For mages a {{item:3165}} + {{item:3151}}  and for ad champs {{item:3153}} + {{item:3033}} / {{item:3036}}. Because people go defensive and start tilting if they are told what to do (especially in bronze/silver) throw a little **XD, XP, :)** after telling them what to build.\n\nYou are an ADC main, and one of your best champs is Vayne- the ultimate F U to tanks. [Practice your kiting](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fep9ueGvUDA) (vayne is A+ at kiting). \n\nI think the hardest issue you are facing is getting your team to peel sufficiently (lets face it, nobody is going to peel for you). Consider [making/joining a premade team](http://boards.oce.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/team-recruitment) so you can communicate with them and work on the skills necessary on being successful in the tank meta.\n\nGood luck ♥","replies":[{"poster":"Darkstorm17783","date":"2016-03-05T08:41:00.544+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You're a legend, Thanks so much","replies":[]}]}]}
