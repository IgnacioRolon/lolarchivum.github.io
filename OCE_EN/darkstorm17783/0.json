Yes, you can win 10 out of 10 in your placements if you were the number one Challenger the last season and the highest you can possibly get is PLAT 1.\n\nLearn how the system works before you complain about it not working.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Rocka","date":"2016-01-28T08:41:59.594+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Everybody will get placed lower.
