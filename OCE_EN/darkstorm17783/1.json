And I understand I shouldve been getting low lp then, but ive been winning over and over. Getting 14-16-18 lp per win and then one loss ends up around 20+ loss of lp. Whats happened? My MMR is normal, I dont understand someone who knows help?","replies":[{"poster":"andyMak","date":"2016-04-09T05:59:53.190+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It works by team\nIf you say dou que with someone higher and your team has higher mmr than the other team you are in favor to win so you lose more and win less\n\nAnd vise versa if yor team is favored to lose you gain more for a win and less per loss\n\n\nTip: at the start of game hit enter twice and type fed to see stats","replies":[{"poster":"Vegathron","date":"2016-04-09T15:57:50.070+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"what?","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Talon12","date":"2016-04-09T06:53:57.450+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"riot uses team mmr to \"predict\" the winner, if the predicted team wins they get a low 14 or whatnot, but if the predicted losing team wins, they get alot more lp than if the other team won.
