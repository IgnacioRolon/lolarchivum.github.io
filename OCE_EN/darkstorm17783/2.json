So many assassins are coming back in (kha'zix, tank akali ewww) as well as all of the tanks being able to pass as a bruiser (dealing all the damage and taking none). While your best bet is kiting and itemising against these, it isn't always easy.  Especially in low elo where nobody is peeling for you._\n\nOne thing that I have found that has helped my games, is learning to **play actively, rather than reactively**.\n\n                                                    **~Playing reactively~**\n After you play the same champs and the same role over and over again, things become habitual, and you find yourself making the same mistakes. You end up treating each botlane matchup the same, even if you should be altering your patterns slightly. This is reactively playing. Sure, you will win your games, but it wont get you as far and probably wont feel as rewarding.\n\n                                                      **~Playing actively~**\n Playing actively, on the other hand, is super fun and will get you far. Playing actively starts in champ select. Play an adc that synergises well with the picked support. Play an adc that provides something your team comp needs. Play an adc that can peel for themselves. Next we move onto laning phase. Even if your team is dead silent, be the happy voice in chat. Communicate what you want to do. Play passive? Engage at lvl 3? Early gank? Tell them. They may think you are the typical adc with a gigantic ego, so make sure you also say gj, well done and ty a lot as well as throwing in some smileys here and there. **Avoid tilt inducing statements and questions like the plague** (\"y?\", \"how did you lose to x\" \"gg ff20\"). Keep up the communication throughout the game. You are the adc after all, and will providing a lot of the damage they need to win team fights and secure objectives. Actively think when going in for trades and cs, wether it will be worth. \n\n* Of course, you could always practice positioning (my favourite game is to try and get to 50 cs in a custom game when vsing mates playing blitz and thresh).\n* \n* Your CS seems well above bronze level, but is something you [can always improve](http://imgur.com/orWUCKH). \n* \n* Builds on your champs seem great, and you adapt to your strengths and weaknesses in terms of items, which is really good. Hardly ever see that before mid silver. \n\nAnother thing you could potentially do is **play support for a while**. It does seem kinda dumb at first, because you came here asking how to get good at adc, and not support. Because bot lane is a duo lane, you also have to predict the movements of 3 other players, not just one. By playing support, it is easier to track the patterns of the enemies as you aren't tunnelling onto cs. It also allows you to learn wha kind of situations are good to engage on and when to back off. Adcs like to think they decide the pace of lane, but in reality, it is the supports. \nTaking time to play support also reminds you of being super map aware (most of my games the adc is potato and won't ward then will overextend and flame the team). Every couple of seconds, you should be looking at the minimap to see where you have vision, checking ward timers, seeing if you can get a glimpse of the enemy position. An A+ habit for any laner. \n\nTL;DR\n1. Playing actively > playing reactively\n2. Games to work on positioning\n3. Always practice CS\n4. Play support will help you see lane from a different perspective, and you can better decide movements as an adc from this. \n\nGood luck ♥","replies":[]}]}
