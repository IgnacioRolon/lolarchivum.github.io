How about stop paying for some psychology intern and hire someone to review the report tickets?\n\nRed please reply.","replies":[{"poster":"GigaPube","date":"2015-09-26T15:57:07.701+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"dude theres like 2 games where he sells his stuff for the boots/revolvers at the last minute when hes actually lost, you do know that right? hes buying pink wards and sightstones where he needs to, so besides the racism maybe hes just bad? consider that if you havent seen him play, which you havent mentioned","replies":[]},{"poster":"Gravelord","date":"2015-09-26T23:09:47.617+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Well seeing as everyone except him fed quite a bit, He must have just been joking when he bought all that stuff cause it was a lost cause.

Don't worry about his racial slurs in-game, he'll get banned for them as long as people reported him. It's the only thing the automated tribunal does well.","replies":[]}]}
