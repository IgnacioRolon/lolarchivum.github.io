Most common at the moment seem to include: \n\n* Maw - although it seems that the burst from kat can kill through this easily, it does help vs LB and the AP supports that are increasing in popularity\n* Frozen mallet - making it slightly easier to kite the hyper-mobile assassins\n* Gage - increase in damage and health when low, will definitely help you get those last hits off (and make them hit harder).\n\nOther ones to consider:\n\n* deaths dance - like _HeartVine_ said\n* phantom dancer - the MS passive can be helpful for kiting, especially when mixed with a movement slowing item such as frozen mallet. the slight damage reduction is also a bonus.","replies":[{"poster":"Your Neighbour","date":"2016-11-14T06:39:40.059+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thanks, been using death dance and it has been pretty awesome compared to Bloodthrister, the damage as overtime really saves me from lethal damage and give enough time to recover the health from lifesteal.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Project Xayah","date":"2016-11-13T08:11:29.389+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Death's Dance.
