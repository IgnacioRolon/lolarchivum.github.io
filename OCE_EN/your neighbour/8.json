Or anyone who's obviously Russian. In fact, I got them more at DoTA 2. \n\nThe main difference to me is the community.\n\nRito emphasizes champion diversity and people often complain about champions being OP to ridiculous levels. There's some pretty hard hating here and I often fall for it too.\n\nVolvo emphasizes elitism and everyone is fine about openly admitting a hero is OP, if it's only usable by high MMR players. I got flamed for asking for more options in controls, as it would make heroes unbalanced if newer players could play them more easily.\n\n\nI really prefer LoL TBH, but I wouldn't be posting here if I didn't like the game, so it's pretty expected which most people would prefer in the boards.","replies":[]}]}
