Should I end it where it is or should I continue (it&#039;s around 850 words at the moment). Thank you!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nKassadin. Less of a name, more of a rumour. I heard mention of the name in one of my passings through the Void. I had paused in my travel not at the name, but at the fear in the voice of the one that spoke it. A group of Void-creatures were gathered around one central figure, taller than the rest and covered in a myriad of talons and spikes, including five on each of its seven limbs. Primitive weapons. This was the speaker. I moved closer, and more details became apparent. The creature told of a monster (recent research indicates that Runeterrans would find this &lsquo;ironic&rsquo;) that traveled in search of Void-spawn, obliterating any it could find. I was intrigued. Destroying Void-spawn required a strength possessed by few Runeterrans, and this Kassadin had not appeared in my research before. \r\n\r\nThe central figure took notice of my presence and froze. I could almost see the stress on its face as it watched me, trying to work out my intentions. With its level of intelligence, this could take a significant amount of time. And I am not patient. A flash of magenta light, and the creature was replaced by a cloud of ash, sending its listeners scattering in all directions with bone-wrenching screams. I ignored them and focused on my new data. Kassadin. Appearances from the creature&rsquo;s memory indicate that it was a Runeterran capable of harnessing the energy of the Void, and was using this energy to destroy Void-spawn. How interesting. But this led to more questions. How?\r\n\r\nThis I pondered over for many hours. I needed answers, and my previous investigations were insignificant compared to this. I ran through my extensive memory fast as light (which I discovered travels at approximately two hundred and ninety nine million, seven hundred and ninety two thousand, four hundred and fifty eight metres per second) until I stumbled upon an insignificant detail lost in the back of my mind from many years ago. &ldquo;Kas sai a dyn&rdquo; meaning &ldquo;who does the desert know&rdquo;. One that gave guidance across the harsh deserts of the land called Shurima. But the man who these words came from did not pronounce them as such, for they lacked knowledge in the Shuriman tongue. Instead, they simply referred to their guide as Kassadin. I do not believe in coincidences, and so it was decided. This Kassadin was Shuriman. \r\n\r\nSpace opened in front of me, a jagged rift, its edges glowing with a deep magenta light. Beyond the rift lay the Shuriman desert, sweeping rock faces and dunes stretching towards the skies, framing the birds of prey that circled overhead. As I left the rift behind me, it closed silently, leaving no indication it had been there at all. My eye flicked around, examining the landscape around me with utter precision. Nothing but the sand, the birds, and the village. The winds from the South were blocked by a steep rock face on that side of the canyon, rendering the place in almost permanent silence. Laying in front of me, what was left of the village shimmered in the midday heat. Its appearance would have been strange to anyone who did not know what had happened there: On the left side of the village, the buildings were mostly intact - albeit neglected - but as the eye moved over towards the right, buildings began to at first collapse, and then seemingly disappear into the ground itself. Not that any excavation would reveal what was missing, that was long gone. Years ago, part of the ground underneath the village had instantaneously vanished, replaced by an opening not unlike the one I had used moments earlier. The opening was gone just as suddenly only moments later, taking part of the village with it. No cause for the opening had surfaced yet, although it was likely Malzahar. Something for later. \r\n\r\nIn the centre of where the opening had formed lay a pile of debris. Insignificant at first glance, it was only to an eye as perceptive as my own that could see it had been disturbed in the time since the rift had closed. Scavengers? Not possible. A quick lookover of the rest of the village turned up no other signs of disturbance. Besides, the Runeterrans were terrified of this place. Only a man in search of something very specific would go where no one else dared. I looked again. The silence was broken by the sound of plasma colliding with the rubble, a clean buzz as the very molecules of the wood and sandstone were broken down into their components. The birds above scattered in fear. I saw clearly what I had missed. The dried blood of a man, blood drawn out of desperation. And I had seen with my own eye what desperate men could achieve. What lengths they would go to to find what they sought. And as I turned my eye towards Icathia, my hunger grew to insatiable levels. I would find this Kassadin. And I would break apart his very being until I knew what drove him.","replies":[{"poster":"Buttercup","date":"2018-03-08T09:41:06.255+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It definitely sounds like Vel'Koz is talking; very 'academic' and unempathetic.\n\nThe story does seem a little... unfinished. As far I can see, Vel'Koz hasn't actually done anything besides, well, reading and watching the precursor to a confrontation between himself and Kassadin, which means that the story doesn't really stand alone. You've got another 650 words, use them! I wanna know more!\n\nIt'd be nice, for example, to read about how Kassadin kills Void-spawn, and why he's so revered, instead of having a Void council simply mention him, forcing the reader to take their word for it.\n\nDefinitely caught my interest, but it needs a bit more _story_ to really bring it home.","replies":[{"poster":"Fluff ewe","date":"2018-03-08T10:18:37.796+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"second this. \n\nI feel like you'll run into issues with the word count without making the ending seem rushed.","replies":[]},{"poster":"PepprMinty","date":"2018-03-08T09:50:44.339+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'll get back to working on it asap, thanks so much for the feedback!","replies":[]}]}]}
