Most of the champs released after him now have more skins than he does, excluding the SSW Skin. Is there one in idea/development? \r\n-As a Rengar main, I speak as a few voices on the rift that all ask the same question; &quot;Why pick Rengar when Kha&#039;Zix is open?&quot; which, above a certain elo, is true; limited help in teamfights unless in the right environment, fairly easy to play around early, and almost entirely relies on picks and not being bullied early game. A few champs have had changes made to help combat these obvious weaknesses, but Rengar does seem to be left a little out of the spotlight. It would be beneficial to help him leave his early game weakness as his late game power isn&#039;t all that threatening if the enemy team spends 75g and buys a pink ward. Is there any notion to helping the kitty?\r\n\r\nAlso yes, he&#039;s the &quot;One Shot King&quot; to some people, and whilst I love him dearly I do recognise this is mainly only relevant below plat elo or so, before people start understanding he really isn&#039;t that threatening.\r\n\r\nThoughts?","replies":[{"poster":"TrashDonnut","date":"2016-04-13T05:27:14.684+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"What about Yorick?\n\nThe dude hasn't got a skin in years.","replies":[{"poster":"Nezu","date":"2016-04-26T13:54:19.709+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yorick is being reworked, Riot aren't going to release a skin on champ they plan to completely change.
