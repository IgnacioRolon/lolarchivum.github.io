This may be a known bug but i&#039;d like to bring light to it anyway.\r\n\r\nMoving on, Rengar used to be one of the prime jungle picks for some time until elements of his kit were changed as i&#039;m sure many are aware. The fact of the matter is that he fails in comparison to his counterpart Kha&#039;Zix, who has both a strong teamfight and far better assassination potential, which is quite insane given he beats his &quot;rival&quot; in both areas. Rengar&#039;s kit revolves around getting picks on a squishy target and destroying them, however as of late his damage just doesn&#039;t seem to be consistent enough throughout the game to compete with the likes of champs like Kha who seem to have far larger burst, as WELL as having far greater mobility in all environments, and aren&#039;t limited by things such as brushes. Even as a Rengar main he honestly feels like one of the bottom tier junglers at almost all stages of the game unless he gets ahead, but even then being fed on him just isn&#039;t as rewarding as it is for other champs. I feel like I speak for a vast majority of Rengar players when I say he needs a bit of TLC to bring him even a TINY bit closer to the spotlight, even if it&#039;s just enough to keep him from being the &quot;oh khazix and Nidalee are banned guess i&#039;ll play him instead&quot; in certain elos. A lot of ADC mains will probably disagree with this entire post however in comparison to almost every other assassin in the game Rengar sits near the bottom of the pile. If there were a way to make him much more rewarding the more skilled you were, such as champs like Azir, this could be a way to positively impact his performance without making him unhealthy.\r\n\r\noh and let&#039;s not even TALK about the lack of skins. All I can taste is salt towards Kha&#039;Zix mains :(","replies":[{"poster":"Nightjar","date":"2016-08-05T23:19:02.229+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"rengar is by no means weak. I mean he might be a tad weaker than a khazix if played properly in the lategame, but as assassin junglers go he's about average and he's got alot of straight up fighting potential with very few items. I do feel khazix is the top tier stealth assassin jungler atm, and other picks like akali are dominating the assassin/fighter archtype but there a number of junglers who aren't as good as rengar in the meta right now.","replies":[{"poster":"Nezu","date":"2016-08-06T08:53:17.985+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I politely disagree with you on that one; Rengar just doesn't seem to have the same threat level as he used to. Such was the game where he could usually 1 shot the enemy ADC by level 11 with 1-2 items, which was pretty unfair sure, but now it's more focused on his ability to land a bola and kill the carry a lot slower than the means of other assassins. I just feel like he doesn't have anything that makes him stand out or shine in any situation that a LOT of other champions don't already have. I'm not saying he's unplayable, but he does need some love to bring back.","replies":[]}]}]}
