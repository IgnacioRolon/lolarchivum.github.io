Games where a person might have loaded in late but still gotten into the game and still performed well are now being ended before they even have a chance to restart their client.  Especially people without top notch internet connections or with older computers. \r\n\r\nI&#039;ve personally had this problem where I crashed loading into ONE game in the last two weeks, but that was enough to get slapped with a leaver penalty, and because of Riot&#039;s ridiculous policy of never reviewing or removing leaver punishments, I&#039;m stuck with it. Not because I left a game, but because my game crashed and I loaded in just a little late. \r\n\r\nThe leaver system either shouldn&#039;t apply to remakes, or it should take a much more consistent pattern of leaving to incur such a heavy punishment, because having to wait twenty minutes a game for five games is absolutely insane. I don&#039;t intentionally quit games and very rarely have crash issues, but having a crash once every handful of games shouldn&#039;t exclude me from being able to play altogether.","replies":[{"poster":"Nikkip","date":"2017-07-30T05:29:30.910+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"The biggest problem I've run into is when the game bugsplats and then the client is like \"Hey this may be due to a bad patch or install, let me just take several minutes to run the repair tool, non-optional\". Happened to me last night, of course the repair tool ended up doing nothing my install is clean, but that extra time it requires to scan all the game files is guaranteed to keep me out of the match for too long to beat the remake.","replies":[{"poster":"Nightjar","date":"2017-07-30T07:37:53.272+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I remember back somewhere around season 6 in my placements, my game bugsplatted and then tried to repair, and then informed me I needed to restart my computer to finish the update, and by the time I got back into the game, the game was almost over, but somehow my team won, but they asked to report me... so that's interesting.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Lord Sesshomaru","date":"2017-07-30T04:51:14.075+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"A leaver punishment system is definitely needed. League is a game where each player counts for so much that unequal numbers throw games way out of whack. So in order for the game to survive it physically cant risk people leaving too often.\n\nHowever, I agree that the remake timer often hurts people who don't need to be hurt. \n\nI have tried timing myself, doing a full restart from load-screen, to power off, to restart, to open league, to reconnect _(obviously not in pvp games)_, and I only barely make it with a little time to spare.\n\nBut if I had to actually solve a problem as well during that time _(like connection issues or something)_ I 100% wouldn't make the timer, every time. \nAnd I have a fast computer!\n\nIn my experience, 2 times out of 5, in a game that is remade, the person who failed to join, reconnects in time for the post screen, which is stink for everyone.\n\nAlso when you've only got an hour to play, you spend 4 mins waiting for a game, another 5 - 8 mins in champ select and load screen, 3 minutes in game, then someone remakes and you're back to square one. \nExcept this time you only have 45 minutes, so you wait 4 minutes for a game, and another 5-8 minutes champ select/loading screen. But now you only have time for a 30 minute game. Which isn't enough time, seeming the average game is 30-40 mins, which means if you only have an hour to play, or only enough time for one game, you physically can't start another game after the remake.\n\nSo a remake actually ends up costing you an hour of game time.\nI don't know about everyone else, but in a normal game i'd much rather take my chances in a 5v4 and hope they reconnect, than not be able to play at all.\n\n__________\n\nI think remakes are fine, but they should only be a thing in ranked, where a late connection actually matters.","replies":[{"poster":"CapNRoddy","date":"2017-07-30T05:34:01.086+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I don't think the leaver punishment system should be done away with, I just think it needs to compensate for remakes, and be a bit less sensitive. I crashed loading into ONE GAME in the last two weeks. 3 games in total of my last idontknowhowmanybutalot games. \n\nThat's definitely not often enough to make getting punished over technical issues reasonable. If I'm averaging less than one 'leave' (not even real leaves, games that got remade before I even connected) a month, it's absolutely ridiculous for the leaver punishment to kick in.\n\nAnd if it's happening to me, it has to be happening to others.","replies":[]}]}]}
