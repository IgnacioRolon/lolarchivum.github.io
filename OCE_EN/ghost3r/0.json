Not only have you managed to half her burst damage and turn her into a melee range assassin that has to be played like a mage using repetitive rotations of spells to kill a single squishy target (wtf annie/syndra/ryze can burst faster than her?)  you have also managed to take everything any Akali player enjoyed about playing her out of her kit, the increased ult cooldown , halved damage plus decreased range make her ult feel clunky and overall painful to use when you see Diana or Ahri mains running around with lower cd, smoother, better scaling and longer range ults. Her ult used to be useful, for both mobility and damage, now it is neither. Her w change i am coming to grips with and I believe this was a cool and innovative new idea, similarly her e changes are alright, not amazing not awful. The BIGGEST PROBLEM you have created is her passive, I can confidently say that her spellvamp passive was the reason 90 percent of Akali players played her. It was a unique and enjoyable part of her kit and you have completely scrapped it. If her upcoming full rework doesn&#039;t involve her getting her old passive back I will see no reason to play her anymore and shall choose along with numerous other Akali mains (you will be missed best Akali FL) to stop playing League altogether, these changes have been extremely painful considering the large amount of hours and money for skins i have invested into this champ and I feel sad to leave LOL on such a bad note due to such an unnecessary change. Tweaks I can handle, cooldown changes I can handle, damage changes i can handle, however taking away such an innate and unique part of her kit that is a large reason for most Akali players to play her is just to much.","replies":[{"poster":"Talon12","date":"2016-11-12T05:33:02.826+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"cough cdr cough lich cough none of the things important for her cough none of those you build cough.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Fitzky","date":"2016-11-12T13:25:29.047+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Lets play a game, for every screaming akali main you see whining on the boards, take a shot","replies":[{"poster":"GHOST3R","date":"2016-11-13T12:07:17.500+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"you'd be dead in no time","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Moonland","date":"2016-11-12T07:06:48.434+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"She's getting a buff on PBE","replies":[{"poster":"GHOST3R","date":"2016-11-12T10:05:19.114+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I know but that wont fix her clunkiness, just buff her heal/dmg","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"I Stealth I","date":"2016-11-12T07:31:06.086+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey, it's just how the game flows. Champs get reworked and nerfed all the time. I mean, as a Talon main, I never asked for the rework, even if it buffed Talon a lot and gave him parkour. I never wanted the rework to happen but it did and I'm used to it now.
