The first time I noticed this, It disconnected me mid game and wouldn&#039;t let me back in despite me having perfect internet connect and NO FIREWALL INTERCEPTING IT! This has resulted in me losing 2 ranked games including today when it didn&#039;t connect me into game. It also wouldn&#039;t let me in an ARAM Earlier either. PLease fix this asap, I&#039;m trying my hardest to climb and the last thing I need is servers not connecting me for whatever reason. PLEASE! I&#039;m sure I&#039;m not the only one with this problem either.","replies":[{"poster":"Stefo","date":"2017-02-12T04:44:27.336+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"It just did it again, and Now ive got 5 game restriction for low priority que for 5 minutes.
