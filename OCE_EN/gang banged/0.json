Just had a game where most of us agreed to an open game due to a 1/10 full crit Ryze top lane only to change our mind and drag it out as long as possible when the enemy team antagonizes the situation by saying they WON&#039;T report him after game............... Probably created 4 more trolls for the next game.","replies":[{"poster":"Project Xayah","date":"2017-12-03T11:26:54.959+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"This isn't exactly news.\n\nFact is, people (generally) don't give a sh!t when it doesn't affect them (even less so when they get something good from it), but then when it does affect them it's the worst thing in the world. It's called being a hypocrite.\n\nNothing you can do about those kinds of people.","replies":[{"poster":"Gang Banged","date":"2017-12-03T13:23:36.761+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'm just disappointed because the Ryze was 100% trolling,  I mean how hard is it to punish the guy? I send a report, beg my team and enemy to report as well . 4 hours later and still no generic automated message saying \"we did something about a report you submitted\"\n\nThere needs to be more transparency in the reporting system so we know that X person that you reported has received a punishment, at least then people might start to believe actions have consequences.","replies":[]}]}]}
