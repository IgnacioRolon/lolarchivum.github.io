And it's a shame! It's not that the champion isn't serviceable in ARAM, it's just the way people tend to try and play him. Like, throwing out random boxes and stealing the odd kill without ever seriously engaging the enemy is just...not that helpful. It might produce a flashy-looking KDA, but trust me it's usually not bringing the numbers to the table.\n\nOn the other hand, I've seen some outstanding Shaco's that control the brush, set up constant ambushes, and jump into battle after the initial salvo and assassinate targets, using his slippery kit to keep himself alive while bringing the pain.","replies":[{"poster":"Nightjar","date":"2019-03-25T10:05:11.478+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"It's not even about zone control, as much as you might disagree, since against any semi competent opponents they'll get vision elixirs which ruin bush strats.\n\nThe true measure of an aram shaco's worth is 'INCONVENIENCE'. \n\nYou can get as many vision elexirs as you want, and they'll let you destroy any shaco boxes you walk in 500units of, but the problem is when you use your vision elexirs and there aren't any shaco boxes to destroy... or at least it seems that way. You walk up and down, you check the bushes and you might only spot 1 or 2 boxes on their own, and that's fine.\n\n But then your vi or alistair tries to flash combo on the Ashe, except they flash and get feared and cc'd, because a truly experienced master of inconvenience that is the aram shaco has predicted this eventuality about 20s ago and has prepared for this and a few other eventualities that didn't happen.\nDo you plan on tower diving? eh probably not a good choice, there's probably a shaco box where you don't expect it, and no boxes where you do, or maybe not and the shaco boxes are in normal places and you're being too paranoid, or maybe both, and you aren't being paranoid enough, or maybe the shaco is already hiding in the bush behind your team and is waiting to assassinate a squishy who decided to rotate backwards, maybe they aren't. Maybe they are and they have 3 or 4 boxes to protect themselves, or maybe that's what he wants you to think, and he actually has no boxes on that side, but is trying to make you walk the long way around, into a box trap, maybe that shaco standing with his team is the fake one with the real one in the bush, or maybe the fake one is in the bush and the real one is with the team, wait did the real shaco walk into fog of war, or was that the fako and now the 'shaco' running away is the teleported fako and the real one is stealthed, or maybe the fako was in the bush and expired and the real shaco screwed up and is trying to run towards the fako boxes.\n\nYour job as aram shaco is to be annoying, inconvenient and to overcomplicate. Don't always play optimally, it's better to randomly change strategy or intentionally act dumb. Make the enemy team confused and infuriate them, you'll do enough damage with just a few boxes, e spam and assassination, damage or zone control or peel isn't really your role, though having high damage as aram shaco is a good indicator of how well you're fucking with the enemy team. \n\nIt's not about magic damage, it's definitely not about physical damage, it's about emotional damage.\nGeneral rule: the more the enemy team swears in allchat and buys oracle elixirs, the better you're doing.","replies":[{"poster":"Mister Xenos","date":"2019-03-26T11:02:21.273+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You seem to have a great bead on things. What are you thoughts on Ivern and Bard? They're a pair of champions that seem more screwed by the game type than the players.","replies":[{"poster":"Nightjar","date":"2019-03-27T04:55:07.803+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"bard isn't bad in aram, but he isn't a 'support' in aram. You can't halfass your build, you either go tanky with aftershock, full ap with electrocute, or magic pen atkspeed crit sorc boots with hail of blades or electrocute depending on enemy teamcomp.\nBard has to itemise in a strange fashion in aram, but it can be fun and impactful nonetheless.\n\nIvern I can't say I have much experience in aram with, but from what I've played and seen, he is extremely teamcomp dependent, his most viable build is part shieldy support, part tanky with a little ap. He can make alot of the weaker aram picks shine through his root and shield, and depending on the enemy team, daisy can be a nuisance. However, if his team doesn't have synergistic team members, or the enemy team gets a particularly well focused dive/brawl/poke comp, he's very very weak. He has difficult itemisation choices, and can struggle to make an impact if his team wasn't already dominant.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"naian616","date":"2019-03-25T05:14:05.637+0000","up_votes":0,"down_votes":0,"body":"playing shaco is my favourite champion to play in aram, just go full ap with fleet network for them heals and become really useful. U can save your allies by fearing them and do decent damage and also create space of your allies with the clone and is generally a good champion in aram (utility, traps, space control, cc, assassination potential, etc.) so yeah. When i play shaco, i normally see myself at the higher spectrum in regard to damage. Otherwise, good luck in your next aram games!\n\n{{sticker:sg-lulu}}","replies":[{"poster":"Mister Xenos","date":"2019-03-25T09:23:37.248+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yea, it's a shame people don't seem to understand how to adapt him away from SR's ganking playstyle into Shaco's zone controlling, assassinating playstyle.\n\nOn that same topic? Le Blanc. Seen her do some amazing stuff, but most people (myself included, admittedly) just do garbage with her. Would rather have just about any other assassin!","replies":[]}]}]}
