However, I've seen just as many games lost because of what items people are buying. According to fancy MMR websites, my games tend to sit around 2000 and I have this to say to my colleagues:\r\n\r\n1. Don't build glass cannon on tanky champs if the rest of your team is 4 squishies! Unless you've got something clever up your sleeve, this is frequently just a recipe for letting bruisers like Garen steamroll your entire back line.\r\n\r\n2. If the enemy team is literally 5 champions who deal primarily magic damage, and not a single one of them has failed to build AP, there's decent MR options for practically every champion. Even a pair of mercs can dramatically boost your survivability.\r\n\r\n3. If YOUR team is literally 5 champions who deal primarily magic damage, now's the time to be thinking about getting an Abyssal Mask if it's good for your champion. The upside to the enemy being able to itemize against your entire team with one stat is this singular item!\r\n\r\n4. In a similar vein, if the enemy team is 3 or more AD auto-attackers, you might want to think about something like Tabi or Randuins. Even for AP auto-attackers, the negative attack speed can do a lot more to reduce their damage than MR, especially if they've got a void staff.\r\n\r\n5. If you have 4 AD champions as your teammates and are playing a champion that readily build AP, by all means do so! Most likely the enemy team will be itemizing against your teammates, allowing you to dish out a lot of extra pain.","replies":[{"poster":"Mister Xenos","date":"2019-05-14T23:00:43.776+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"6. If the enemy team is full of a bunch of poke champions and your team isn't, this is not the time to go \"/all GG champ select\", it's the time to buy Righteous Glory or Shurelyas if you can fit them. Poke-heavy champions are typically weak if you can jump on them in exchange, and these two items will help your WHOLE TEAM do it!\n\n7. Try to find some way of slotting sustain into your item selection if your champions doesn't have any of their own. You're no good to your team sitting back at 20% health barely contributing. But if you picked up Prospector's Blade and Bloodline, a couple of waves can get you back into fighting shape! Warmogs is a great pick for beefier champs as always, even after the nerf.\n\n8. Refillable potion. I don't see it nearly enough. Takes only a single death to outheal normal potions for the same gold (500 vs. 450). Cheap, economical sustain for literally any champ. I buy it every game.\n\n9. For the love of God, champions like Mundo and Vlad can be a huge nightmare and if possible, do everyone on your team a favor and get Morello's or Executioner's. Your match history will thank you sincerely!","replies":[]}]}
