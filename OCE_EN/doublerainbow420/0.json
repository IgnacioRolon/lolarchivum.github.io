Is that not insane? I am good at the champ, why should I have to give even more to show that I&#039;m good. It&#039;s an emote for Christ&#039;s sake.

I would say less tbh.\nI have been unranked since season 2, but I'm often playing ARAM vs plats and diamonds (even master and challenger at times).\n\nSo people can gain mastery tokens in a Rift game vs 5 bronzies, but I can't gain tokens in an ARAM game full of gold/plat/diamond/+ players?\nLegit system.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Gamer 15 YouTube","date":"2017-12-04T21:57:29.385+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"For those who did not finish buying all champions need more BE for champions too and I took advantage of the IP > BE conversion and spent my BE on runes pages (got 2 rune pages, now I have 4) and ran out of BE and since then I got only 3k BE and I have 7 champions to upgrade to level 6. I think we get less BE than we need buying champions was easier when there was IP and i am not sure about upgrading champions got a little bit easier (if you dont buy any champions and only upgrade mastery lvl).","replies":[]},{"poster":"Best Evelynn OCE","date":"2017-12-04T21:27:25.787+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"As a one-trick, since I don't need to spend BE on champions or whatever, getting the necessary 7,150 BE doesn't take too long.\n\nIt doesn't affect my main since I already had it unlocked, but I just leveled a smurf account and I began saving BE since hitting Mastery 3 (I needed to spend BE on champs in order to play Ranked). Considering I got the required Mastery 6 tokens 2 games after hitting Mastery 5 and the Mastery 7 tokens 5 games after upgrading to Mastery 6, there wasn't too much time.\n\nThe only thing was I ended up with 3,400 BE when I finished collecting my Mastery 7 tokens. Since I had just leveled up, I disenchanted all of my PROJECT tokens and upgraded.\n\nTL;DR - As long as you don't spend your BE while leveling your champion, you shouldn't have too many worries getting the BE required to upgrade to Mastery 6/7, especially on a new champion where you aren't experienced enough to get S's every game.","replies":[]}]}
