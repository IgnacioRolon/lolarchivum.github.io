I dont take climbing seriously and i do my best to try hard and be positive in all my games. \r\n\r\nBut for some reason even though i deserved diamond, im not ranking up?? i cant for the life of me figure out what the heck is going on..\r\nthen it dawned on me, obviously im not gaining elo for my performances. sometimes ill even sit in bushes and hide away from teamfights i think we&#039;ll lose so i can keep my k/d very good. but STILL..... no rank up. \r\n\r\nI think this needs to be seriously be looked at because im getting pretty frustrated that my skill is not being rewarded.\r\n\r\nthanks guys!","replies":[]}
