However, its seems as though some seriously selective account suspensions are taking place... \r\n\r\nIf you have a christian person and they say they disagree with gay marriage, they immediately get harrassed and bullied. Why dont the people who harrass and bully the christian get banned??\r\n\r\ni think its completely ridiculous that people  are taking sexuality so seriously that things like this are falling by the wayside and in some cases ENCOURAGED!\r\n\r\nin no way is this a gay hating post, its asking for equality which is exactly what all the &quot;gay pride&quot; people are asking for.. not necessarily in direct relation to homosexuality and religion but also to a range of other areas.\r\n\r\n\r\nget your head on straight riot, catering to a minority that complains louder than any other doesnt make it the most important one..","replies":[]}
