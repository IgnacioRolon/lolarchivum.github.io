Riven has been forgotten and left for dead she doesn&#039;t scale enough compared to other champs even a SHEN can fuck up a riv so easy with armor and no ad with a 800 gold armor item . Even elo champs are saying not to play riv cause she is a bad champ to use in  2018 can you guy&#039;s fix her please.","replies":[{"poster":"esp","date":"2018-05-07T14:48:22.667+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I play a lot of riven, but not in toplane mainly because I just suck at toplane and I'm a mid main. I think her early to mid-game is pretty good depending on match ups. I usually win lane and even if I don't dominate I ward their jg and kill him, it's good 1v1 potential. But against tanks, yeah, I feel useless-ish.","replies":[{"poster":"KAYN BRINGS PAIN","date":"2018-05-07T17:41:52.217+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yeah ikr but in saying that i remember riv being a fighter not a assassin. Oh and the game is getting more worse and worse the more updates they do the more the game goes to shit. Even tower glitches and shoots out of range minions will attack you even if you have minions in front of you. Tower can 2 shot you dead. The runes aren't really custom like the way it used to be was so much better nothing is unique anymore everyone has the same ruin builds/ This game is starting to become AIDS its all over the shop mages are the new OP champs like these clowns should have left it alone the idiots.","replies":[]}]}]}
