People do stuff that makes no sense. There is a reason why OCE is non-existent on the international stage. There is no home-grown talent - you guys are all quite bloody awful.","replies":[{"poster":"Prodïgy","date":"2018-06-24T03:57:24.761+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"So, you don't want to duo?\n\nI mean, you're right, honestly in the retrospect of this region, OCE has always been behind everyone else, because we lack raw talent.\n\nAnd most oce players who achieve highly in challenger are often graded as NA Diamond or low Korean Diamond in other regions.\nThe main thing about OCE players is that we are more toxic, meaning that we don't listen to macro plays.\nWe are also very selfish, in the mindset of \"you must carry, and the 4 other people on your team are useless\".\n\nBut hey, if you think this region is awful, come play with me and you'll get a taste of how truly trash this region is.\n {{sticker:sg-ezreal}}","replies":[{"poster":"kaboomblah","date":"2018-06-24T04:57:06.128+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Let's play!
