So, first of all I&#039;d like to outline that this is false advertisement; well not really. False advertisement is misdirection or misleading information about a product. This wasn&#039;t exactly misleading, more like an unexplained occurrence. So, not exactly illegal. But i&#039;d like an explanation as too why no one received the skin. I think this would be also wanted by most other players that went to the viewing party in Sydney.\r\n\r\nI&#039;m not TOO fussed about not receiving the skin, but I know some people that are. So, any rioters out there or anyone managing the event; an explanation would be highly appreciated.\r\n\r\nSecondly; It was extremely lagging while we were watching. I don&#039;t have any evidence, but you can trust me when i say that it was freezing, the sound was cutting, and we couldn&#039;t tell when Caps was dying. (*erm* *erm* ) I was actually quite infuriated by this. We missed on the live worlds final 2018 because of bad technical management. Obviously, being the initiative&#039;s that we are, we attempted to watch on our phones. But, there was a 10-25 second delay. (because of the lag). I&#039;m well aware that the match wasn&#039;t being straight projected from YT or Twitch, because of this time gap, so it must of been from a Riot-supported-live thing.\r\n\r\nAnyway. Thanks for your time, anyone who can give me answers.\r\n\r\nOh, and also, anyone who went to the other cinemas too see the Grand Final, did you get the Ashe Skin? And was the quality unbearable?\r\n\r\nThanks!\r\n\r\nJoey.","replies":[{"poster":"Achenar","date":"2018-11-04T00:50:46.737+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey Joey, thanks for flagging this and I'm sorry you had a poor experience.\n\nThe skin codes will be emailed out over the next couple of days - it's a purely digital process and unfortunately there are some technical limitations that mean they can only be sent out AFTER the viewing party.\n\nRegarding the tech/quality issues - we're following this up at the moment.

It was perfect besides the random millisecond of no audio, once every, say 20 minutes, and when the confetti happened the quality went down to 360p haha. Sad to hear you guys had an awful experience.

The opening ceremony was alright, just a few lags and the quality was like at 380p lol but I could hear it fine...but as soon as the games started...it just went downhill...glad to hear you didn’t have a bad experience though!

I also went to the Sydney viewing and I didn’t line up for a refund because I heard that they were only giving free tickets to other movies. I just went to then PC cafe downstairs to play League. To be honest I wouldn’t have minded if they streamed from YT or Twitch with a 20 second delay. The quality would’ve been better and I wouldn’t have to storm out disappointed with the quality and sound. :/ So far none of the Rioters have responded to questions about the skin. Anyways, I hope we can get some answers soon because I’d really like to get the skin as some form of compensation for the poor quality of the stream.","replies":[{"poster":"Xp1re","date":"2018-11-03T14:15:40.740+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I did the exact same as you also in Sydney haha. Sadly I didn't get a goodie bag this year I did get a refund on my ticket tho but agree that the free ticket to a different movie is a pretty mediocre compensation.  Last year we got the free corki skin code in an email a few days after the event I think the same will happen this year.

Apparently other places in Aus didn’t have the same lag, so I’m quite disappointed with the tech management. I didn’t stay until the end, but did any of the cinema managers say anything about it? I would’ve lined up for a ticket to watch Halloween, but the line was just too long. The swag bags were alright, but I’m a bit anxious about the skin. I just submitted  ticket asking about it to see if I could get any answers about it because so far no one’s got explanations. Even if Riot were going to give out the skins a few days after Finals, it’d be nice if they gave a warning. Anyways, hopefully I get the skin, otherwise I just wasted time and money booking a ticket to a screening that wasn’t even that good.","replies":[{"poster":"Prodïgy","date":"2018-11-03T15:05:08.650+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"dude i was in row f aswell haha we were on the end seats to your right i believe\n\nanyway quite sad honestly.
