Move to the Turkish or Russian servers.\nTBH, your CS and kda are kinda average in all of the games that I have viewed in your match history.\n You are in bronze 3 with 500+ games played, indicating that you haven't yet got good enough to get out steadily yet. (Your KDA confirms this). \n\n**YOU ARE PLAYING IN BRONZE**. bronze players (like myself) are there for a reason. we suck at making calls and making plays. You can't complain that your team are all 'downys' because in that elo, almost everybody sucks. And those that don't suck, wont be bronze for long.\n\nThere are trolls in all elos, even challenger. Some times your team will have one/two and sometimes the enemy team will have some. All you gotta do is report, block and move on.\n\nLastly, don't ever use 'downy' as an insult again because it is hurtful, immature and disrespectful to use someones life as an insult.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Slim Chaedi","date":"2015-01-20T00:36:34.506+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"-Complains about toxicity.\n-Belittles a huge group of people by using Down Syndrome as an insult.\n\nBuuuuuut, not gonna rip on you too hard for doing that, because I think we all use something we shouldn't as an insult. I do games with friends all the time. It is the best way to play League, and if other people are toxic to us it is a lot easier to excuse when we are together. Find some peeps! It increases your game quality by a lot.","replies":[]},{"poster":"GoldenTomat0","date":"2015-01-19T23:55:41.791+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":">Looking for someone to carry my ass because apparently in solo queue it's impossible to do good and win a game.\n\ngit\ngud","replies":[]},{"poster":"RNG Remilia","date":"2015-01-19T22:06:10.779+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"1. Change your attitude, stop complaining about your teams and toxic players. Trust me the OCE server is nothing compared to XBL/PSN and other severs.\n2.

Because that tag solely exists for stress relieve reasons and nothing more, it really does nothing.\n\n\"Looking for someone to carry my ass because apparently in solo queue it's impossible to do good and win a game.\"\n\nPlease consider the number of people that play this game and the number of people like you who thinks it's impossible to win. Also do you feel the urge to complain when it is the enemies who get the short end of the stick?\n\nBut really, it's still preseason, hold off your impulse and play when Season is actually live.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Samurai Jin","date":"2015-01-19T19:00:14.927+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I see your problem!\nYou're playing Lee Sin!\nHe's not worth learning tbh, pick up J4/Vi/Fiddle/Ww/Yi and Amumu jungle, these can all carry games far easier than Lee Sin. \n\nBtw, about toxic players, just laugh at them and mute, not worth stressing over, just play to improve, don't even look at your LP, just play to improve 100% of the time, and stick to 1-3 roles and 1-3 champions for each role.","replies":[{"poster":"SEKAI","date":"2015-01-19T21:57:55.284+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"[{quoted}](name=Samurai Jin,realm=OCE,application-id=Ntey9fRZ,discussion-id=t3alzJy6,comment-id=0001,timestamp=2015-01-19T19:00:14.927+0000)\n> You're playing Lee Sin!\n> He's not worth learning tbh, pick up J4/Vi/Fiddle/Ww/Yi and Amumu jungle, these can all carry games far easier than Lee Sin. \n\nIn low tier yes, but when you do get to learn Lee, you're on your way to Diamond because he is that good of a champ since well you can't really counter pick/build/play him.
