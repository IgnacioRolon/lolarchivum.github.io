That has all passed now and i&#039;m climbing back up steadily, it should only be a matter of days until im back into silver so i would prefer if you are already in silver or are bronze 1 / previously in silver this season.\r\n\r\nNow for more of the important things; I play quite a lot, and in ideal circumstances I would like to play with someone consistently not just another person that is an alright player for me to duo with. I play most during the day until late afternoon/evening (4pm normally) then return at 5:30/6 and continue up until about 12/1am AEST.\r\n\r\nI am an extremely competitive player, this is a forewarning. I want to learn, and I want you to be willing to learn which means calling me out on things that need improvements as i will definitely do the same for you (i.e. awareness, warding, positioning etc). I&#039;ve previously been in high pressure competitive environments on both world of warcraft and diablo 3  (top 15 oce WoW, top 5 NA D3) so Im very goal driven and being relatively new to league (only returned in october/november) I want this year to be focused onto getting into gold 5 minimum.\r\n\r\nToplane:\r\nFor the most part I play all AD tanks / bruisers. Trundle, malphite, poppy, rammus, maokai, hecarim, sion, gnar, darius... The list goes on for tanks. My only real carry champion that i play top would be gangplank, he is my main however i&#039;ve been unable to play him consistently as of late since ive found teams to be unreliable when it comes to teamfight stages).\r\n\r\nADC:\r\nI&#039;m a fan of the meta picks right now, they suit my playstyle and my champion pool very nicely. Jhin, sivir, cait, ashe and the occasional draven (still perfecting him). With jhin in particular i&#039;m quite picky with my support champion, i prefer someone that has some form of hard CC or disengage that can proc my W easily, meaning morgana, nami, leona, alistar, braum (Nami and morg being my current favourites).\r\n\r\nWhat I expect from you:\r\n- Willing to learn - both mechanics &amp; current meta builds, champions &amp; optimal rune/mastery setups\r\n- Highly competitive - I need you to want to win as much as I do, which encourages learning and improvement\r\n- Discuss performance and what needs to be improved, both you and myself.\r\n- Be honest - if I am doing stupid shit over and over again tell me when you notice so that I can fix it.\r\n- Skype - enough said, its easy and efficient  to call things as opposed to type.\r\n- No getting butthurt - If Im constantly picking things that need to change, I&#039;d hope you&#039;re mature enough to take criticism and work with it to improve, this is reciprocal for me, If you bring  up things im doing badly then I will do my best not to have a sook (Which has never happened as far as i can recall)\r\n\r\nPreferrably drop a message below before you add me ingame or your name might get lost and  I will never message you for a game or two.\r\n\r\nThanks\r\nJake Aka Doctor Jekyll","replies":[{"poster":"DUKE0","date":"2016-05-04T03:38:26.251+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"yo im silver 5 JG main hit me up in game\n\nDUKE0","replies":[]},{"poster":"iZulu","date":"2016-05-04T03:14:05.670+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"hey mate i'll add you in game","replies":[]}]}
