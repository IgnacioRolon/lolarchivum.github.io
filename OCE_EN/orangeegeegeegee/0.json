The VS page doesn't say they were meant to be limited time, but since they're gone now I guess they were. The old VS emotes became available this time round so it's likely these ones will come back next time there is a VS event :)","replies":[{"poster":"Orangeegeegeegee","date":"2018-08-22T20:03:19.041+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"ohhhhhh you remind me that this lion really looks like the one that Garen has.
