For the worlds most popular game I&#039;m surprised that I&#039;m only limited to reporting people after the game even though its too late and I&#039;ve lost my LP already. Why are players limited to only reporting after a game? Why can&#039;t we report or vote to kick players threatening to troll, afk and feed?","replies":[{"poster":"Maraudaur","date":"2015-07-11T08:16:40.738+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey man, Sorry you had to go through a negative experience! \n\nI know that feel man when your team starts fighting before the game even begins due to wanting to play the same role/lane.

If someone is obviously mentally unstable enough or foolish enough to declare their intent to ruin your game you and your team as a group should have the power to effect or remove that person.","replies":[{"poster":"Project Xayah","date":"2015-07-16T02:13:12.580+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"> I am sorry without a vote kick function the community will never feel like they have the power to affect the outcomes of their ranked or solo q games.\n\nI'm sorry but I have to disagree with you on that. I don't feel that way, lots of people I know don't feel that way. Just because you feel that way doesn't make it apply to everyone.","replies":[{"poster":"Axis of Struggle","date":"2015-07-16T02:46:47.273+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"There will always be trolls. By making a Team ranked system i am sure you might beat the whole i am upset someone stole my role behavior but if someone goes into a game with the intent to troll what defense do you have to stop that. ATM and it happens frequently someone goes into a ranked team setup telling everyone they are going to troll and by dodging you effectively let the troll win and the good  player is punished. By not dodging you allow them to gratify themselves at your expense. What defense does the normal player who wants to win a game have?.","replies":[{"poster":"Project Xayah","date":"2015-07-16T03:18:36.975+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> There will always be trolls.\n\nExactly. There **will** always be trolls. Their intentions are to annoy people and waste peoples time. I'm quite confident they don't care whether they waste 20 minutes or 20 seconds of someone's time, as long as they get a response. While a \"champ select kick system\" might make it easier on people who play the game for fun or to win it doesn't solve/neutralise the troll problem.","replies":[{"poster":"Axis of Struggle","date":"2015-07-16T06:08:01.025+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I seem to have found a forum warrior.
