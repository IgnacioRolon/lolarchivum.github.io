Like any normal human I assumed the Rent for 7 days option on a skin shard would cost a few orange essences and you&#039;d be able to buy it permanently when you had enough orange essence. \r\n\r\nAfter 7 days, and 20 box purchases to get enough essences later, I find out that the skin shard will be destroyed after the rental period. NOWHERE was that stated and WOWWW did it almost give me heart attack. Does anyone know where I could go to file a complaint on this to get the skin shard back, or at least insist on patching the system for there to be a warning sign to go with the friggin rental option?","replies":[]}
