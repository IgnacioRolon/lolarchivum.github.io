I don&#039;t really know when it is coming so if anyone has a website or something that shows when thee next few patches are coming, can you plz show me :). This is because I dont get a chance to play league b4 school and I only get a short time to have play after school. If i knew when the patches where, then i could leave lol open.\r\nAlso we really should be able to postpone patches for like a week {{summoner:3}} . This way we could patch when we had time. Thx 4 any help/comment\r\nPS. Sorry 4 any grammar, spelling mistakes\r\n{{champion:86}} , {{champion:161}} , {{champion:154}}","replies":[{"poster":"Project Xayah","date":"2015-09-26T06:48:02.486+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Generally, there is an announcement made on the boards a day prior to any scheduled maintenance, including patches.
