Did you know that the [TOU](http://oce.leagueoflegends.com/en/legal/termsofuse) and [EULA](http://oce.leagueoflegends.com/en/legal/eula), both of which you would've agreed to upon creating your account, state that it is solely the players (in this case, you) responsibility to ensure their internet connection is stable enough to play the game? The fact you've been hit with multiple of the highest level LPQs tells us that you have been neglecting that responsibility and, as a result, have actually broken your agreements with Riot. Riot don't have to give you more chances, but they will, and if you continue to disconnect it **will** result in a perma-ban, which is a good thing since you'll no longer be ruining the game for other players.","replies":[{"poster":"Robo23","date":"2015-09-27T03:02:28.166+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yeah I understand this, it's fortunate that I can connect most of the time\nIt seems that if I connect b4 to much time has passed I won't get a long queue","replies":[{"poster":"Project Xayah","date":"2015-09-27T03:33:27.070+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"So, you continue to play knowing you'll be ruining the game for dozens, if not hundreds, of other players?

Well there probably is but i cant give any.\n\nAnd yet you have given a a response, though one that would be perceived as selfish, that could answer both my questions in your very next sentence, and I quote:\n\"I just want to have fun on LOL\"\n\nBut answer me this; why should the fun of many people suffer so you might have fun? Is there not something else, within our vast world, you could do for fun that would **not** adversely affect the fun of other people?\n\nSomething for you to think about.\n\n> I have only been totally disconnected twice.\n\nI find that extremely difficult to believe. Fact is Leavebuster wont give you even a 5 minute LPQ for two DCs. It might if they were in consecutive games, but you admitted yourself that you have received **at least** 3 20 minute LPQs, which means you should have, at some point, received at least 1 5 minute and 1 10 minute LPQ also **and** also received the pop-up explaining the negative effect of DCs that asks you to type \"I agree\" upon your first DC. Under normal circumstances the \"requirements\" of 3+ 20 minute LPQs is **at least** 10 games you've DCed from, which means you've ruined the fun of the game for potentially upwards of 90 people.","replies":[{"poster":"Robo23","date":"2015-09-27T10:13:10.062+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"This is just a statistic that may or (probably) may not be true. I mean I will admit that I have been given a few lower priority queues, but that was ages ago. After reading through all the comments I finally see what the point of this thread is. Some people may have problems with LOL but we have to try adjusting. That was all I wanted to say. I know that I created a few problems but I can't really help it. \nAnyway another point that condemns me less is that if somebody quits really early it allows the other players to adjust. I know it isn't a hardcore defence but it at least takes of some blame.

While you may not have control over the stability of your connection you do have **complete** control over how that affects other people. You **chose** to continue playing and ruin the fun of the game for so many other people, and your responses lead me to believe you would continue to intentionally ruin that fun.\n\n> Anyway another point that condemns me less\n\nThere is nothing that condemns you less. The damage is done not only as a result of your connection but also of your choices. It does not matter at which point in the match you DC, DCing is DCing and it ruins the fun of the game either way. You attempting to take the blame off yourself through weak excuses just shows how selfish (and, probably, entitled) you are.","replies":[{"poster":"Chicken4dinner","date":"2015-09-27T11:15:11.302+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=HeartVine,realm=OCE,application-id=Ntey9fRZ,discussion-id=1iLz4261,comment-id=0002000000000000,timestamp=2015-09-27T11:08:06.685+0000)\n>\n>You attempting to take the blame off yourself through weak excuses just shows how selfish (and, probably, entitled) you are.\n\nAmping it up from well done to fully roasted","replies":[{"poster":"Robo23","date":"2015-09-27T22:17:59.212+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thx 4 that, ðŸ˜‹.
