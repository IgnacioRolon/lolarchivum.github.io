If he's the weakest link all he has to do is be \"carryable\" come late game. Ask your jungler to communicate when they might get ganked, lay down vision for them and keep them safe, focus on getting your solo lanes ahead and start controlling objectives. If the bottom lane are at least even without giving up deaths, then the objectives you take elsewhere on the map will put them ahead in effective gold and stats later on.\nI wouldn't bother lane swapping as it's pretty tricky to get right and you have to have a pretty solid understanding of how to control minion waves and when to swap back. \n\nSome of the more simple things I've become a lot better at this season after getting back from an extended break (was plat 3 last season before decay) is not walking into their jungle to place deep wards on my own and/or supporting whoever is laying down that deep vision just in case.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Fog","date":"2015-04-09T00:35:15.441+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Team Composition. \n\nIdeally each of you have their preferred roles. So work on building team comps around that. Look at what champs each of you are strong with and what compositions you can make from those. In addition look at which of you is the strongest and which of you is the weakest. Then see what you can do to manage this e.g. a weaker bot lane comp may need a jungler who can synergize and provide support bot lane or a mid lane/jungle combo. With picks and bans look at what champs you guys play and what you guys can play against what. If you guys want a certain team comp then look at banning champions that would drastically impede on that team comp. Work on different play styles and team coordination. e.g. mid push or bot push to drag rotation. Communicate well with each other to get good ward coverage. At some stage you should all be able to place a pink ward on the map. Priority warding. You don't always need to ward the entire map. Ward the area you are focusing your play. e.g. dragons and barons. \n\nGood luck.","replies":[{"poster":"DiddleMANnzl","date":"2015-04-09T01:41:13.520+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thank you for your responds i really appreciate it :) \n\nOur weakest member is our adc (super nice guy love him to bits but hes i bit weaker then the rest of us.)  any advice on how we deal with that each game. 2 v 1 swaps maby. our sup is  abit of a god and normally can get him kills in lane but hes always down in cs eg last game he was 3 0 3 (sup got him feed0 but way down in cs  like 15 after 5 mins 30 or more after the lane is over.  as a jungler should i camp that lane or let the support Cary him through and deal with there adc later etc. (anyone can answer that )","replies":[{"poster":"Fog","date":"2015-04-09T01:51:17.818+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I don't think implementing a lane swap is the best tactic to strengthen your ADC. Instead get him stronger in the standard 2v2 lane first. To make bot lane stronger as a whole for the time being you don't necessarily have to camp bot lane with constant ganks but make sure you have a strong control over the botside. Making sure that you'll be able to respond to enemy ganks or if the enemy bot lane turns super aggressive you'll have a decent amount of time to react accordingly. In regards to the ADC himself. if csing is the problem at the moment try and get him to run a couple custom games and just get him to practice hitting every cs in the lane. Make sure he knows how to freeze and last hit. Get him to watch his auto ad dmg and the amount of health the cs has. Eventually it will become muscle memory what the health bar looks like to the amount of dmg your last hit will do. Try and get the support to zone out the enemy bot lane as much as possible to give a safety net for your ADC to be comfortable to cs in. Sometimes ADC's can be overwhelmed by the enemy bot lane when going for cs due to harass and over extensions. \n\nGood luck.","replies":[{"poster":"DiddleMANnzl","date":"2015-04-09T03:21:37.488+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thank you for another great answer :)","replies":[{"poster":"Fog","date":"2015-04-09T03:24:01.725+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"No worries.
