I played Corki into Zed and was ahead in cs (30 cs to 17 cs), was in exp range the whole time, and he hit lvl 5 while I was lvl 4.\n\nAlso I played a game as TF vs Syndra and was being poked out / zoned, however I out leveled her at around level 4 as well, was about 15 cs behind her, even after an early back (and she shoved the lane into tower meaning I should have lost exp).\n\nSuspect there&#039;s an experience, or catch up experience bug. Not aware of any exp runes or early cheese in the jg.","replies":[{"poster":"JasonWazza","date":"2017-11-08T04:44:54.814+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The thing your not thinking about is, hitting the CS isn't required for EXP.\n\nIt's a matter of, the higher level person, has generally stayed in lane, and not backed, hence they haven't missed any waves worth of EXP.","replies":[]}]}
