Really? I mean like... Honestly? You claim it is a \"soft\" reset, I know new players that have never been ranked before and ended in silver 3-4, you're telling me my mmr hasn't been completely reset? How does a player who reached platinum and should have had at the VERY VERY LEAST gold 2/3 mmr get placed in silver the same placing as people who have never played ?!?!?!?!\n\nWhat kind of system is this? I'm suppose to waste hours each day climbing through silver and gold? AGAIN?!?!? Do you really think this is fair... I struggled last season to reach plat from bronze had more wins than losses and improved my game play now I have to restart league from the beginning? It took me an entire season to get from bronze 3 to plat 5 and I was going to aim for diamond this season. I thought at worse I'll end up in gold 3, from there maybe I can climb to diamond in one season. You know.. not like i have anything else to do in my life.  Straight out, no beating around the bush I feel like I've been scammed and I find this to be complete bullshit.\n\nJust played my first game in Silver 2, completely dominated had no interest in the game barely tried and only got +25 lp. After all the money and the 2,489 hours on League of Legends which means 104 days (that's right, i cared enough to check) I reached silver, YAY! Simply because Riot and all it's money can't (or don't want to) create a system that works.\n\nHow is it fair to be demoted 2 entire tiers over only 10 games when it took almost 800 games to get there? Even if I lost 10 in a row In plat 5 I wouldn't get demoted to silver.

The reason they made it such a hard reset is because of ELO boosters. Their logic is: If you are good you can get back to your ELO and ELO Boosted kids have to go and get boosted harder. It is just pointless and a waste of time. Riot is just screwing with people.","replies":[]},{"poster":"HORSE OF FORCE","date":"2015-01-22T00:29:05.436+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":">Simply because Riot and all it's money can't\n\nAll hail the free-to-play fat-cats at Riot.\n\nugh\n\nIf you truly enjoyed playing the game then you'd be thrilled by the fact that you can now play the game for an even longer period of time while still making progress.","replies":[{"poster":"Noop","date":"2015-01-22T00:47:53.524+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Problem is I'm not making progress in silver, I have no difficulty stomping every game. It's boring and a waste of time. It's far too easy. It took me one day to reach gold. \n\nOh gee, to think that the most popular free to play e-sports in the world has money? How is this possible?

It could have been a freak scenario where because of one particular loss, you were then being matched against silver/bronze players, hence why even if you did win against them, you would gain much MMR, hence be placed especially low.\n\nI know from testing that it's not necessarily how well you do in placements that determines your rank, but it's who you verse.\n\nBut by the sound of it, you're not exerting too much effort to reacquire your rank. You have my best wishes to get it back, that is if you're gonna try it.","replies":[{"poster":"Noop","date":"2015-01-23T13:28:26.280+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thank you, well I'm already in gold 3 65lp in 2 days and I'm playing with and against diamond/Plat + players in gold which brings me to another issue i'm facing now, why do I have to vs higher ranks to climb through lower ranks?","replies":[{"poster":"HORSE OF FORCE","date":"2015-01-24T09:44:20.018+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Well, who you verse is determined by your MMR, not your division. If you're playing with your Platinum skill level, as in, raking up a lot of wins in a row against the gold players, then your MMR will rise back up to that of a Plat player.\n\nIf you're lucky, then the next time you go for promos, you might go up two divisions, because of the MMR to division discrepancy. Promos are decided by MMR, not just what division you were previously.\n\nBest of luck.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"headshotjosh","date":"2015-01-22T00:35:13.843+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"same issue here i was bronze 5 reseason hadnt played for a year and worked up to silver 4 went 6-4 and got d\nemoted to bronze 4","replies":[]}]}
