I&#039;ve tried repairing league, reinstalling, restarting comp, running league with no programs running in the background, lowest settings for highest performance. None of these work and I can&#039;t find any fixes for this problem online. I haven&#039;t been able to play because of this lag and it&#039;s really getting annoying. Any help would be greatly appreciated.","replies":[{"poster":"SorakaXHealBoT","date":"2015-05-23T12:49:59.396+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"i have the same problem, although my problem is more with the Lag spikes. I am comfortable with sub 200 ping but recently it kept going up suddenly and its very unstable. To increase Fps a little try untick the Vertical sync.","replies":[{"poster":"HORSE OF FORCE","date":"2015-05-29T13:45:20.578+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"What ISP are you with?\n\nAlso are you on a smurf?","replies":[{"poster":"SorakaXHealBoT","date":"2015-05-29T14:24:05.519+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"LOL smurf ? i just started playing like 2-3 months ago although this is not my main account tho.  I actually have no idea what my ISP is ... 2-3 months ago i actually have pretty good and stable ping but now the lag spikes is just too much and i can get pings like 900+.  Also what makes you think that i am a smurf ?","replies":[{"poster":"HORSE OF FORCE","date":"2015-05-30T02:29:35.223+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Well, Soraka heal-bot strats are pretty old, considering it's no longer really possible on her new kit. I was thinking it was an extra account you made a while back and maybe didn't start playing until sorta recently?\n\nYou should know what your ISP is. I wouldn't eat a sandwich if I didn't know what was in it or who was responsible for it. What if it's poisoned? You can find out what your ISP is by asking the person who granted you access to the internet (unless you somehow miraculously got a connection without finding out what an ISP is).","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"HORSE OF FORCE","date":"2015-05-23T02:03:27.381+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"What's the specs of your computer?\n\nHave you tried uninstalling your anti-virus and/or firewall?
