Open the League Launcher \r\n2. Click the Orange &quot;LAUNCH&quot; Button\r\n3. Hear the sound it makes when you click it usually but no Disclaimer comes up/nothing happens\r\n4. 20-30 seconds later disclaimer comes up and then well.. nothing happens when I hit accept.\r\n\r\n\r\nOther things ---- \r\nWhen I click anything within the Launcher, for example Repair. Nothing happens either, the repair Accept/Decline box doesnt show up.","replies":[{"poster":"Big Bustahealz","date":"2015-08-14T12:21:10.193+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"man i am getting the exact same thing, it is super frustrating as i've tried everything recommended and even possible solutions posted by others.

I completely uninstalled my Anti-Virus software (BitDefender).  This, along with a restart made it work.  I then reinstalled my anti-virus.  Once I knew that was the problem, I went through not just the 'Firewall' part of the software, but EVERYTHING and methodically added League of Legends files to all the exclusion lists I could find.   Hope this helps others.","replies":[]},{"poster":"KiTT0","date":"2015-08-20T09:42:27.181+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Has anyone found a fix for this yet?
