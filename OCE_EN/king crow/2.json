Lp depends on your mmr. If your mmr is lower than the average given your elo then you'll end up earning like 18 lp below, 20-23 is the average and anything above 25 is an indication of your mmr being higher than average/elo lvl etc => skip elo depending on situation. Have you been on a losing streak before your winning streak or have you hit 0 lp and lost on 0 lp? If you've been on a losing streak before then that has dropped your mmr but if you've lost on 0lp and didnt demote then the lp you're gaining is making up for the loss on 0 lp.","replies":[{"poster":"King Crow","date":"2017-04-18T17:14:21.924+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thanks, that makes alot of sense.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"SEKAI","date":"2017-04-18T16:10:51.442+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"To put everything in a nutshell: It depends on your \"MMR\", a short for Match-Making Rating I believe.\n\nMMR is hidden from your view on the League client as the time of this typing (may change in the future), though one could use 3rd party sites such as \"op.gg\" to check your MMR (which is mere estimates as far as I know, but according to Riot, at least op.gg's numbers are the closest to their in-house database), and it's the true determinant of your standing in the ladder. MMR is updated after every match, increased or decreased based on either you've won or lost.\n\nIn essence, every league and division will have its own \"estimated\" or \"average\" MMR. When yours is below that value, your LP gain will be lowered, while in the opposite case, your LP gain is increased per victory. The opposite applies for LP loss per defeat.\n\nWinning and losing streak will also increase and decrease your LP gain per victory respectively, and once again, the opposite applies for LP loss per defeat. \n\nIn the extreme scenarios, with an insane winning streak one can gain up to 40LP per win and lose about 10LP per loss and division jumping might also happen, while in the opposite case of the worst losing streak where your LP has ended up too low for your current division average, one can lose up to roughly 30LP per loss and gain around 10LP per win.\n\nIt is said that if your LP gain per victory is about 17-20, then you're right about on the average benchmark of your current division in terms of MMR.\n\nIf you duo though, the system will I think, give you a \"fake\" MMR that is slightly higher than your actual MMR, and thus matching you with someone slightly higher skilled than who you'd have actually faced if you go solo, as the system assumes that going duo has an innate advantage.\n\n............\n\nGiven enough thought though, one could see that this system in general has a couple oversights, shortcomings and pitfalls. One of the biggest problem is that, it takes a lot of time to \"correct\" it. Say if you've had losing streaks in the recent past for whatever reason, the system automatically assumes that you're not fit for your current division, as such your LP will be lowered and your loss increased. Then you will be spending a good majority of your foreseeable future \"evening\" that losing streak so that the system would see you as worthy for your current division again, even though it might not have happened because of your own personal lack of skill in the first place. This creates a lot of unnecessary intrinsic grinding in \"slow\" ladders like this LoL's rank system, which may be the source of problem you're describing, I won't know.\n\n............\n\nI'm open to correction and expansion. Please do address if you know better.","replies":[{"poster":"King Crow","date":"2017-04-18T17:14:55.466+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thanks bro, that helps.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Challenger 4 Mee","date":"2017-04-19T11:29:58.923+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Welcome to Elo Hell","replies":[]}]}
