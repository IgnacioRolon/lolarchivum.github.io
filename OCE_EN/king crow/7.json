I know they were premade because they all had the same club tags. I didn&#039;t bother replying. At the end of the match they said they were going to report me and tried to get the enemy team to do the same.\r\n\r\nI haven&#039;t gotten any notification of a ban or anything, i was just wondering how does Riot respond to reports. Do they ban players who have been reported multiple times without actually checking up on the game chat and stuff or do they actually check it? \r\nBecause if it is the number of bans then all these toxic premade guys have to do is gang up on guys like me and then bam, banned. I was just wondering if anyone knew whether or not people can get banned because of premades like this. I mean i know that Riot has a limited number of staff, not nearly enough to thoroughly check reports, but i wanted to know how does Riot sought through reports.","replies":[]}
