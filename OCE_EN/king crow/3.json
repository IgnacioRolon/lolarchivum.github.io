This doesn&#039;t make sense. Not to mention it&#039;s broken. His crows kept flying back and forth and he was regenerating health (or lifesteal, i don&#039;t really know how it works) all while being in Zhonya mode. \r\nI&#039;m just wondering if this was just a glitch or something yet to be patched.","replies":[{"poster":"Fitzky","date":"2017-11-04T05:16:30.156+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Morgana can do the same thing with her ultimate, it's not a bug.","replies":[{"poster":"King Crow","date":"2017-11-04T05:22:04.785+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Fitzky,realm=OCE,application-id=Ntey9fRZ,discussion-id=7d4svW9v,comment-id=0000,timestamp=2017-11-04T05:16:30.156+0000)\n>\n> Morgana can do the same thing with her ultimate, it&#x27;s not a bug.\n\nI thought they patched that, same with Kat???","replies":[{"poster":"Fitzky","date":"2017-11-04T07:35:24.344+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Idk what you're going on about with kat but they never patched anything to do with that, zhonyas doesn't stop channeled abilities and toggles like swain and anivias ult.","replies":[{"poster":"Talon12","date":"2017-11-04T08:32:57.028+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"it stops channel abilities, but it doesnt stop toggle (which is what anivia and swains is)","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"DarkShade918","date":"2017-11-04T06:03:06.087+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"and fiddle, once a channel is ACTIVE, zhonyas can't interupt it\n\nAniv Ult still runs while zhonyas too","replies":[{"poster":"Talon12","date":"2017-11-04T08:34:23.220+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"its a constant effect, not a channel, channels require a constant unbroken duration, which is why kats does cancel as opposed to swain and anivia, which are toggles, a constant effect.
