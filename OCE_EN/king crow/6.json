One thing i&#039;ve noticed is that the skill level of players i get matched up with now are ridiculously low even for bronze compared to when i first started back in season 2. Of course there are people who i get matched up with who are quiet decent however most of them are very poor. \r\nI&#039;ve also noticed that most of them are beginners who&#039;ve been playing for less than a year and still don&#039;t understand how complex the game has become. I was wondering if there were easier ways to help them and new players other than reddit and league forums. Something more accessible and easier to understand for newbies.\r\nAny thoughts?","replies":[]}
