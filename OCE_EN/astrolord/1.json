Most of you right now are like: \"Great, here&#039;s another goddamn silver complaining about being in silver\"\n\nBut that&#039;s not why i&#039;m here. \nSo I went into champion select with my friend, and at the end of champion select, the window closes and I go back to my desktop instead of going into the loading screen.\n\nI went back to my client and it says \"game in progress\" or something like that.\n\nWeird.\n\nI restart my client and press \"Reconnect to game\"\n\nStill nothing, I go back to desktop. I&#039;ve done this 1000 times and I still don&#039;t get into game.\n\nAnyone have a fix for this? Can rito help me? Support tickets take days!\n\nBy the way, i'm on a Mac","replies":[{"poster":"De4thfire Grasp","date":"2015-06-24T04:50:09.242+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I also need help with this, can someone help me?","replies":[{"poster":"De4thfire Grasp","date":"2015-06-24T04:51:59.026+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I don't wanna get punishment for this because i tried some bot games but won't let me in game","replies":[]}]}]}
