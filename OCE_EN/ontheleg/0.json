Comment your thoughts/ideas and please be sensible about it.","subforum":"Player Behaviour","up_votes":2,"down_votes":4,"body":"Half a day ago i received a permanent ban on my account for verbal abuse, flaming and a negative attitude. It was of no surprise after a few bans before (including a 2 week ban last month and a few smaller incidents). I&#039;m not really fussed about being banned, it was my stupidity after all that caused it, and yes i am admitting that it was all me. However i&#039;m more worried for the money and time I&#039;ve spent on that account. If you do the math, I&#039;ve played around 1500 games (lets say 30 minutes on average each) adding up to around 45 000 minutes or 750 hours in total playing LoL. I&#039;ve also spent over $150 dollars on LoL i&#039;d say. Perhaps just a bit under. I even spent $20 dollars on the game just before i got banned (how ironic).\n\nIt&#039;s quite worrying that Riot would ban players after their long-term commitment to become better at the game, and their dedication to paying for visual upgrades like Skins to support Riot in their creations. Yes i do acknowledge that i made stupid decisions leading up to the permanent ban, yes i was warned before hand through smaller bans and yes it was essentially 95% my fault. No one else was to blame. But why the permanent ban Riot? Why permanently ban any player for verbal abuse and so forth, it&#039;s not inflicting serious harm (because if it really were other legal authorities would be involved) and it&#039;s not damaging the game in any form or matter (because unfortunately in today&#039;s gaming world, flaming is quite prevalent  amongst all gaming platforms and games). \n\nPersonally i find it absurd that Riot would permanently ban accounts, without thinking twice, for such minor offences. Every other game that has ever been published to date has and will never permanently ban accounts over such trivial incidents. I have heard of larger incidents such as hacking, scamming and cheating in other games leading to permanent bans and that is completely understandable, but if every game including LoL was to permanently ban accounts over verbal abuse, unfortunately there would be probably only 25% of the gaming community left. \n\nPlease don&#039;t think i&#039;m jumping to conclusions either. Don&#039;t comment &quot;oh but how come 99.9% of the rest of the LoL community hasn&#039;t been permanently banned?&quot;, because that&#039;s not what i&#039;m getting at. If Riot were actually thorough about these bans, trust me there would only be 25% of the community left. You&#039;re basically telling me you&#039;ve never flamed or sworn in game? Are you really telling me you&#039;re an Angel? Be honest with yourself. \n\nRiot seriously needs to reconsider their banning scheme. Remove permanent bannings almost altogether. Keep if for larger incidents such as the intention to hack, or did hack. Or cheating through programs that help you script in game. Or scamming other players for their RP through gifts. Etc. If they don&#039;t want to rework their banning scheme, i suggest they immediately refund each permanently banned account&#039;s RP and ship that RP off to another account owned by the same person. Now don&#039;t say &quot;oh but why would you want to reward players that caused emotional distress to others through verbal abuse etc?&quot;. It&#039;s not a reward to have your account revoked from you, with 84 champions that you individually saved up IP for, with all that time spent playing ranked.. trying to get better and learn more and more along the way, not to mention all that time spent leveling up to level 30, all the friends you made on that account, your ranked teams and clubs all gone and so much more. It took time and effort to build that account, so it being revoked would make people  like me reconsider my stupidity and insolence in the Riot community and across other games, refund us the RP to another account and i&#039;m over 100% sure people like me will reform into the community and make it a better place even. We could lead others and be good examples of what not to do as we have had personal experience. I don&#039;t understand why we have to be punished unforgivably by Riot, and i understand even less as to why there is no support from Riot surrounding bans in general. It&#039;s all automated and fake and they don&#039;t take into consideration the actual feelings of the players being banned. LoL this past month has felt like a casino dedicated to making you lose money no matter the costs. I regret supporting them but i really don&#039;t want to. Doesn&#039;t anybody agree with me?\n\nThe solution should be to chat ban accounts for a month on end, remove their rights to type anything of an inappropriate nature. Please don&#039;t say something completely bullshit like &quot; oh but if we do that instead, then that&#039;ll punish other players due to the lack of communication without typing in game&quot;, because that&#039;s an easy fix. Just revoke their right to play ranked while they have a chat ban in place. In normal&#039;s you don&#039;t really need to type that much and Riot&#039;s system of being able to type a single word/sentence every couple of minutes during a game is good enough how it is. In-fact its perfect.","replies":[{"poster":"Project Xayah","date":"2016-04-04T04:20:38.104+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=ontheleg,realm=OCE,application-id=T8eq2lFQ,discussion-id=E74ersQY,comment-id=,timestamp=2016-04-03T15:30:05.482+0000)\n>\n> yes it was essentially 95% my fault.\n\nI believe the value you are looking for is \"100%\"\n\n> it's not inflicting serious harm \n\nF\\*ck this statement, seriously.

Are you really telling me you're an Angel? Be honest with yourself.\n\nHardly, we aren't all special little angels that are perfect and never get mad. That is about as far from the truth as you can get. I'm a freaking Emissary and I've gotten mad in chat before. I believe the Yi said something to the effect of \"don't worry ull learn, I call the shots not you\", now that just pissed me right off.\n\nThe difference? That was ONE game. I can think of maybe two games where it's gotten the better of me in actual chat (have your frustrations, just don't take them into game to abuse people). I've never received a behaviour alert (though that system has no been removed) and I've never been punished. This is true of the VAST MAJORITY of players.\n\nSo you want Riot not to perma ban for consistent verbal abuse because it's \"just\" abuse? I think you need to take a long hard look at your attitude, and why Riot takes this so seriously.","replies":[{"poster":"Talon12","date":"2016-04-04T09:27:35.569+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"know what isnt far from the truth though, people who personally aggravate players to get them banned, i would think riot should be doing things about those people.

Riot might as well get rid of their tribunal system and let people be  toxic and create a negative gaming environment. \n\nI know its tough to lose all  of your efforts and money  but a permanent ban is not enforced just by one game or one incident. It is the accumulation of offences that you have done and you may not remember all but Riot does. You should also know that Riot doesn't tolerate toxic behavior at all. Why continue on with your improper behavior? \n\nI played from NA to EUW server and I got ban once for being a flaming idiot.
