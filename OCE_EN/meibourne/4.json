Could you be so nice to which you would allow PLAYERS who play ranked and attempted to progress out off - Bronze, Sliver, Gold.. An Beyond, \r\nTO NOT go form 70lp to 98lp etc... LIKE WTF ITS 5+LP it&#039;s not going to unbalance the game..,  Just give us the LP instead of making us play another game of 30+ minutes Just to receive 3LP.. so on... I understand, for say you land on 92lp yes that sucks ass but when you&#039;re 5,4,3,2,1 LP Away that&#039;s just saying FUCK YOU play another game and get 2 feeders and carry it out to an hour, What I&#039;m saying is I&#039;m sick off having to play games just to receive 5 an under LP.. like half the time i end up losing because my team is donkey balls at it and throws, then I have to get 40LP.. like Does this happen to yous? it&#039;s annoying and you should just get free 5LP, Example I get 17LP for a 55min game, COME ON? &#039; Thoughts/?&gt;{{champion:142}}","replies":[{"poster":"gravityhacker","date":"2017-11-28T14:09:57.435+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"No, it doesn't matter if you land on 99 etc, LP doesn't really matter, nor does the rank like bronze 5, 4 ,3 etc. The only thing in ranked that matters is your hidden mmr, mmr is what decides who you play with and against. \nWinning and losing increase or decrease your mmr, so as long as you're winning games you will climb reguardless, doesn't matter if you need to wait 1 or two more games to get into your promos because of 1 or so lp, as long as you're winning, your mmr is increasing, therefore you are climbing up the ladder.","replies":[{"poster":"Nightjar","date":"2017-11-28T15:09:41.611+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"yeah but like, nobody sees that hidden mmr, all people care about is silver 2 or 3, gold 5 or 4, when comparing ranks, so being 1lp off promotion feels like a bit of a waste, since you win and earn 28lp, well 27lp just disappears.","replies":[{"poster":"gravityhacker","date":"2018-01-09T23:56:45.249+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Nightjar,realm=OCE,application-id=Ntey9fRZ,discussion-id=VhN8uiUk,comment-id=00000000,timestamp=2017-11-28T15:09:41.611+0000)\n>\n> yeah but like, nobody sees that hidden mmr, all people care about is silver 2 or 3, gold 5 or 4, when comparing ranks, so being 1lp off promotion feels like a bit of a waste, since you win and earn 28lp, well 27lp just disappears.\n\nStill doesn't matter imo, Lp just doesn't really matter, nor does what your rank shows. It only matters what your actual in game skill is, and your hidden mmr. The more you win, the higher your mmr will be, and the higher ranked players you will be matched with.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Nightjar","date":"2017-11-28T15:07:45.583+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"or what about if, when you hit 99lp and you have to play another game for another 25lp, that if you do succeed in your promos, the lp carries over (at least between divisions like silver 3- silver 2). Much easier to implement, and could also be used in reverse, such that dropping below 0lp, racks up lp debt (up to a cap), making the ranking system more dynamic and allowing you to climb and fall a little faster and more consistently.\n\nMight be a better idea than rounding or handing out free lp?","replies":[]}]}
