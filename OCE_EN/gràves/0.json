You can read more about that [here](http://boards.pbe.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/general-pbe-feedback/XT7eu7jz-champion-mastery-level-6-7).\n\nBut this was met with a lot of resistance from the community, and recently **Riot Wingfield** [confirmed](https://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/4akmnd/champion_mastery_lvl_6_and_7/d11awv6) that they would not be using this system.\n\nAs of right now, **Riot** is working on a new system for Champion Mastery levels 6 and 7. [According](https://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/4ai265/any_update_on_rank_6_7_champion_mastery/d10qb79) to **Riot Socrates**, they didn't release Champion Mastery levels 6 and 7 with Hextech Crafting because they didn't want to delay it.","replies":[]}]}
