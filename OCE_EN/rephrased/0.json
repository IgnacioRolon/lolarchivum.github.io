The thing that inspired me to try to think of a new **Jungle** specific item is because if me and you think about it real clearly the only &#039;jungle&#039; items LoL has this very day are the enchanted smite items - {{item:3709}} {{item:3722}} {{item:3707}} {{item:3724}} etc. Now i&#039;m not a jungler player myself or anything but the point is the item I have thought out is  a item that has passives aura effects that help the team out etc that would make junglers feel more unique instead of a jungler having to use **support** items (if they wanted to help out the team, for instance tank ekko jungle; {{item:2049}} {{item:3190}} and sometimes {{item:3800}}) they can have a &#039;smite required&#039; item that will be just as useful as the support items (which were intended for supports but jungles now use them which I think is pretty dumb)\n\nItem name: Up to Riot (couldn&#039;t think of a descent name)\nPrice: 2750\n\nStats: \n+350 Health\n+45 Magic Resistance\n+45 Armour\n+150% Base health regen\n+10% Cooldown Reduction\n\nUNIQUE PASSIVE: Grants 8-12% Movement speed in rivers, bushes etc (Based on level)\nUNIQUE ACTIVE: Grants a bonus active to consumer that makes slows, taunts, knock-ups, blinds, Fears, charms, Roots etc last an addition 1.5 seconds lasting 8 seconds (45 second cooldown)  (click on active; when active a green like elixir effect will start)\nUNIQUE AURA - Legion: Grants nearby allies 15% Base Health Regen 10% attack speed\n\nBuild path:\nSmite of any kind; Kindlegem; Negatron cloak; Wardens Mail; Crystallien Bracer (This build path was only a example of what it would be like; Riot can change it but has to have smite required)\n\nHope you think my new item is interesting (please no haters, not saying jungle is a bad role ;) )\nRiot if you do include this item in season 6 feel free to change the stats of the item, active cooldown amount or anything like that the only thing Just give credits where credits are due ;)\n\n&gt; Sincerely, Pr0Ki1l3r\n&gt;  _Let your dreams be dreams .. **Just do it**\n_","replies":[{"poster":"Zorphiax","date":"2015-11-10T10:02:11.921+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I think this is a good item but it is just like {{item:3146}}, it has way to many stats and abilities like did you have another look at this item after you made it. because, it has a lot of abilities and stats.\n\nStats:\n+350 Health\n+45 Magic Resistance\n+45 Armour\n+150% Base health regen\n+10% Cooldown Reduction\n\nUNIQUE PASSIVE: Grants 8-12% Movement speed in rivers, bushes etc (Based on level)\nUNIQUE ACTIVE: Grants a bonus active to consumer that makes slows, taunts, knock-ups, blinds, Fear, charm, Root etc last an addition 1.5 seconds lasting 8 seconds (45 second cooldown) (click on active; when active a green like elixir effect will start)\nUNIQUE AURA - Legion: Grants nearby allies 10% Base Health Regen 15% attack speed\n\nIt's rather large.","replies":[{"poster":"Rephrased","date":"2015-11-10T10:21:50.574+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"And it may seem like it has more stats than it actully does because most of its like explainations\n>  (click on active; when active a green like elixir effect will start)\nand things like that :)\n\nThanks for the feedback anyway bro :)","replies":[]},{"poster":"Rephrased","date":"2015-11-10T10:18:36.682+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yeh thats what I thought when I wrote it all down but I still think junglers should have their own item type thingy :P","replies":[]}]}]}
