Every single game of ranked I play, the average rank is around silver but the thing is, I&#039;m not good enough to be silver. I gain ~30 LP for every win and lose ~10 for every loss but I currently have a 27% winrate and am stuck in iron II.  having played 22 games of ranked my mmr still hasn&#039;t changed and almost every single game I find myself outclassed in lane and getting absolutely destroyed. If the game thinks im good enough to be silver then surely I shouldn&#039;t be stuck in iron. What can I even do to fix this issue.","replies":[{"poster":"Typhon","date":"2019-01-06T12:42:31.238+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"hey man feel your pain. its because the new accounts are auto placed in iron 4 however the mmr is still stuck in silver. they are trying to make the climb out of iron easier yet this is the result you get. rest assured as your mmr drops youll start playing easier opponents and the climb out of iron will be easier. you'll eventually get your true rank but it might suck for a bit. just play and see what you can learn. think about why you died there and what you could have done differently. gl on the rift if you really want add me always happy to play with someone and help out where i can","replies":[{"poster":"Superredoli","date":"2019-01-09T01:04:34.286+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"its just repeatedly getting destroyed and knowing that I'm the reason we lost is really tilting and IDK if I can actually bare to play enough for my mmr to be lowered but thanks for the help anyway\n","replies":[{"poster":"Transcender","date":"2019-01-11T04:30:17.691+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Here is something that I don't think anyone else will tell you:\n\nYou are only 20% responsible for your team losing the game.\n\nMake no mistake, this is a team game, that takes into consideration the efforts of every player on both teams.\n\nIf you enjoy the game only when you are winning, then I got some bad news for you. Not even challenger players have a 100% win rate in the lowest mmr while smurfing.\n\nIf you feel like you are the one letting the team down, I would recommend trying to learn where the safety zones are of each champion, not so much trying to contest the lane so much as to try and survive it with minimal deaths. If you are not feeding the enemy, then they are on pretty equal ground with the rest of your team, then from there you can play a much more pleasant game.","replies":[{"poster":"Astaraela","date":"2019-01-11T08:38:14.954+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> Here is something that I don&#x27;t think anyone else will tell you:\n> \n> You are only 20% responsible for your team losing the game.\n\n\nI'm sure that isn't accurate. Team game, yes. Totally carryable, also yes. While you cannot win every single game, imagine someone who is toxic and flames and loses. He had more than a 20% impact on his team.","replies":[{"poster":"Transcender","date":"2019-02-03T21:57:56.326+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Of course, I never referenced impact in my post.\n\nEveryone has all different impacts in each game ranging from -100% to 100%. But every player shares 20% of the responsibility of the outcome on their team.\n\n\"Totally carryable\" is only possible if your team is doing enough to allow you to carry. This game isn't designed to be carried in a 1v5 fashion unless the enemy team is severely lacking in experience and mechanics, let alone a 1v9 where your teammates are hindering your own ability to carry.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"slxw","date":"2019-01-06T03:36:59.897+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":".

You get stomped for 30 or 40 games.  It really is a much more 'try hard to win' environment.\n\nPreseason its usually a bit more painful in some ways, as people are testing things in ranked, with less concern, due to the reset coming shortly.  \n\nYour rank will stabilise at your level, but given that new accts include people with multiple accts (and those who got banned), then the start of season is painful for those near the entry rank.  Some of the people you are facing are likely to be smurfs/banned players, if that makes you feel any better.  If its every game, you have to wait a bit of a while for your MMR to drop low enough to be that of an actually new lvl 30-40 player with no one teaching them.","replies":[]},{"poster":"DarkShade918","date":"2019-01-06T05:27:51.369+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"*Insert Obligatory Git Gud Post here*","replies":[]},{"poster":"QAPLA","date":"2019-01-06T04:32:38.353+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Iron 2?
