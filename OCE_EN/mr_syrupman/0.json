During one of my most recent games I was facing a Kalista and EVERY TIME I used my ultimate on her her auto attacks would CONTINUE GOING OFF through the suppression of the ultimate. Now at first it didn&#039;t do anything I just thought it was a visual bug but then her auto attacks started doing damage to me through my ultimate?!?! Like what is that!?\r\n\r\n{{champion:429}}  bugs through {{champion:90}} Ultimate.","replies":[{"poster":"JasonWazza","date":"2015-05-05T01:29:07.800+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It's technically not a bug because kalista's Auto Attacks can't be canceled.","replies":[{"poster":"Lauricella3","date":"2015-05-07T10:21:16.318+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"they can't be cancelled manually is what it actually means.
