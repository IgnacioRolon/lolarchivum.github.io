Unlikely, since your computer works if you switch to using your phone.\n2) Home Network.  Possible -> switching to your phone bypasses this.\n3) Local ISP Issues.  Possible -> switching to your phone bypasses this.\n4) Backbone ISP issues.  Possible -> likely as we are not seeing widespread problems from Telstra.\n5) LoL Server issues.  Possible, but again less likely as connecting to the server works from your phone.\n\nIt seems like you have tried most of [the obvious stuff](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues) - and providing traceroutes is a great first step.  The traces you have so far are to our OCE game servers though, so login problems will be hitting a different set of servers.  Try running a traceto the following urls:\n\n* lq.oc1.lol.riotgames.com\n* chat.oc1.lol.riotgames.com\n\nOnce you have done that, you can also try using telnet to connect directly to those services, and make sure that you are able to hit them at all.
