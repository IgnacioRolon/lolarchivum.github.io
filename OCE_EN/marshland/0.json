Its absolutely absurd, im sitting here now because I am currently on ranked Que cool down for 30 minutes, with -13lp because this has happened twice in my last two champion selects that I am near on forced into dodging because of other peoples poor choices and lack of taking ranked Que serious. Its not fair, and it honestly makes me hate this game and its toxic trolling community that comes with it. \r\nreevaluate the way you penalize people dodging from champion select, its absurd.

Riot are very good at telling if it is peoples intention to troll and ruin the game for others. Likleyhood is that if they are, other people are reporting them. You should be too. This is the best way to get their accounts fully reviewed.\nMake sure not to dodge or lash out at them or case negativity, just do your best, remember even know it may mean a lot, it is just a video game. Remember to report them and mute them too.\n\nHope I somewhat helped :) :3\n~Reported4Verbal~ OCE~  Always Happy To Help! :)\nARAM Main!

I had 10 games of league in the past 2 days ranked in Silver, and literally all 10 games, I have had feeders, people picking rediculous champs in roles ( Heimer jg, Xerath adc) and because of players feeling the need to troll and the tribunal doing absolutely nothing ( Reported a player quite a few days ago for feeding then afk'ing... saw him again in one of my games doing the same thing ) I have lost 2 divisions. I would queue dodge, but how can you tell what people are gonna be like in game? Riot really needs to reevaluate the mmr in lower elo's. as its the golds and belows that just wanna ruin everyone elses gaming experience. Right now Heroes of the Storm seems the better choice of moba.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Blackavar","date":"2016-02-11T05:16:01.096+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"If you have think that is unfair I suggest you send a support ticket to riot games.
