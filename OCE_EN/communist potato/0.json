Four Yordles are too many. Make it a tankette with a crew of two instead, so that you could have two voice actors with well defined roles - a gunner for attack chatter and a driver for movement chatter.\n2. Make the passive a better defined tenacity effect (20% tenacity, 50% reduced slows and knockups?), improved armour from the front and the ability to move backwards, in exchange for a non-instant turning speed.\n3. Refine the ultimate. Give it, say, 6 seconds of improved speed and the ability to move over and damage enemies followed by 4 seconds immobilised, overlapping with 10 seconds of improved all-round protection. Since the usual strategy with this champion is to keep the enemy facing your front armour, the ultimate should take into account that anyone you run over is suddenly going to be facing your rear armour.","replies":[{"poster":"Communist Potato","date":"2015-02-02T11:20:28.322+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=ForPortal,realm=OCE,application-id=hIjvqaz6,discussion-id=J2FAVfy0,comment-id=0000,timestamp=2015-02-02T06:19:09.847+0000)\n>\n> There are a few good ideas here, and a lot of bad.\n> \n> **The Good:**\n> - A Yordle tank that works best when moving directly towards or away from the enemy or remaining stationary has some interesting consequences - it would be a champion that tanks skillshots rather than dodging them, and is more vulnerable to ganks than straight-up fights.\n> - Given the focus on enemy position, having an ability or two that slows or roots the enemy is a good idea.\n> \n> **The Bad:**\n> - Having four passives is ridiculous.
