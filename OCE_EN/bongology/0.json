Won 10+ games in a row. 64% Win rate. Have gotten to plat with ease (Have been Diamond+ before) and winning handily. Have Plat 2 MMR at Plat 5. Now comes promos and get the most toxic players in existence. Lose promos and ever since then. Have been matched with non-stop trolls, Chinese players who refuse to communicate properly (You don&#039;t need good English to communicate in LoL, everything has a word for it) or just players who will constantly feed. My MMR is now below plat 5 standard and am losing. Explain Riot. What changed within 2 days? Do you purposely match players with trolls/toxic/unskilled players after a winstreak? Do you purposely try and \"challenge\" good players by matching then with bad players to see if they're worthy of where they are despite the game being a team game and require everyone to work together?","replies":[{"poster":"FatedSaviour","date":"2017-05-24T09:08:50.064+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"im bronze but whenever i seem to be finally confident and happy about my game results and matchmaking, i get that salt to reset all the happiness and goodness back to 0","replies":[{"poster":"Bongology","date":"2017-05-24T09:53:54.377+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Doesn't matter what rank you're at.
