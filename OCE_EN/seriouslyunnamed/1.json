Let us close the chat pane on the main window. Having it here makes the whole screen feel out of wack.\n2. bring back custom bot games .these are great to learn new champs with before tilting your fellow blind picks\n3. maybe make the background more opaque to bring out the foreground just a little bit more.\n\nJust my 2 cents","replies":[{"poster":"SUPER DOOT","date":"2016-11-12T15:28:10.065+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"UI feedback:\n\n- Feels too flat, nothing looks clickable, but rather the entire interface feels like drawings on paper\n- RP and XP don't immediately pop out. As a game which relies on virtual currency, you'd think this would be a priority focus point\n- Generally feels lackluster and not satisfying to navigate around\n\nThe old client isn't perfect, but at least feels like a gaming UX/UI designed it to the degree all the right things are in the right places.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Knuuckles","date":"2016-11-12T07:58:25.422+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Custom games are still there I tried one out yesterday I think to adjust some settings","replies":[{"poster":"SeriouslyUnnamed","date":"2016-11-12T13:35:13.165+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"i havnt worked out how to put bots in them yet,\n\nhave had to use the old client for that","replies":[]}]}]}
