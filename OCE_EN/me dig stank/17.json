What is Rito scared of?\n\nI can only see it as a positive, you get ranked based on what Rito wants to rank you on, therefore if you are playing anything outside what they think is best, and your scorecard shows a shit score, than there are only 2 things that can happen.\n\nFirst is you have a fair few loses, therefore you are the one who is making your team lose.\nSecond is you get a fair few win, that means whatever you are doing, you are doing correct, even if it nets a shit scorecard.\n\nThey should also show your MMR, not just end game or in your profile, but everywhere so when you start a game you can see your teams relevant MMR, I know I have dodged a few games once I noticed what their MMR was after I checked on an external site.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}
