If you legit haven't done anything and the report was false, then the warning means nothing because the report got thrown out, the warning basically just means you were reported by more than one player, it doesn't necessarily mean it will count towards a punishment in the future.\n\nOf course if the report was legit then the warning means the reports have been marked against your account in the system, and that if you continue to get reported for that behaviour you will face a punishment.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Gehirn","date":"2016-02-03T03:55:14.143+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It appears that the reason you are being reported is not due to in game abuse, but rather that you autolock jungle in blind pick regardless of if another player has already called the role and locked in.

Seriously, check the reports for the second game ever played in bots, there was a Salty AF Miss Fortune who reported me and said nothing that warranted a report. I played mid annie and wasnt trolling, it was literally someone who has no emotional control. Im sticking my neck out here even posting this and by no means am i trying to instigate a fight, i just want everyone to know that the system isnt perfect.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"fattyhotdogs","date":"2016-02-01T01:48:09.919+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":3,"body":"100% do not believe this.
