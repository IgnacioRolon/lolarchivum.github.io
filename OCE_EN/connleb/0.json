Now I&#039;m not bothered that I lose LP or that I have to wait however much time before my next ranked game.\r\n\r\nI am bothered by the fact that we don&#039;t get a chance to report players like these... unless we play through 20 minutes of pointlessness and frustration.\r\n\r\nCurrently, if someone dodges, the troll has won - they&#039;ve picked a troll pick, someone else has dodged. Not only has the troll managed to stop someone else from enjoying the game for a while, now they get to try again and get a better role or just troll another unfortunate group of players.\r\n\r\nSome people don&#039;t have much time in the day and want to just enjoy a ranked game or two, but if this scenario occurs, they might not get to even play and if they do, they just waste 20 mins of their time.\r\n\r\nI feel like being able to report people in champ select should be an option. That or a chance to remake. People need to be punished for ruining games before they even start. I understand a feature like this would be a challenge to implement well but it&#039;s just got to be done - It sickens me that, at present, players can get away with doing this.\r\n\r\nWould be happy to hear people&#039;s thoughts on this.","replies":[{"poster":"FerrousOxide","date":"2017-02-18T08:05:33.722+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"You missed the worst ones. \"GIVE ME THAT LANE!.\".
