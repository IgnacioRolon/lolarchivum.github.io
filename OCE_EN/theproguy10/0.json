When the Alpha ends, the client will be in the open beta stage. From the [DevBlog](http://oce.leagueoflegends.com/en/client-update/article/a89677b2-53a0-498c-a16d-a926d1788d14):\n\n> Up until this point, the alpha has been limited to players who manually applied using our alpha sign-up process. When the alpha ends, that will change. The open beta will be for everybody—the download will appear in the legacy client's launcher as a pop up. You can make the switch right then and there, fully replacing your existing client with the updated one.\n\nhttps://news-a.akamaihd.net/public/images/articles/LCU/2016/october/alpha_ending_soon/beta-opt-in-screenshot-en_US.png\n\n{{champion:17}}","replies":[]},{"poster":"Tridênt","date":"2016-10-19T06:53:57.690+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I got in{{champion:92}}","replies":[]}]}
