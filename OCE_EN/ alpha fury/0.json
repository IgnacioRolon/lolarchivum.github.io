This year the aim is to make conservationist contribution to Oceanic animals and give back IRL. The specifics will be released during the event. \nIP weekend is fourth on the line of rewards (defeating four monsters) :)\n\nBe sure to enlist and click the link in my original comment! :D","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":" Alpha Fury","date":"2017-01-21T03:21:55.481+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Seems like a no :(","replies":[]},{"poster":" Alpha Fury","date":"2017-01-21T01:34:15.967+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Please tell me we are getting an ip boost riot :D","replies":[]}]}
