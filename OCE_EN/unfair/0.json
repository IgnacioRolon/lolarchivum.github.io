I found this kind of annoying and I've started to play league less due to the leaver-buster queue. \r\n\r\nDoes anyone else think there should be a way to get around leaver-buster? I'm not quite sure what the rest of the leaver-buster punishments are yet since my internet has been fixed for the time being. I would suggest some sort of reputation system implemented to avoid non-toxic players being punished for things they don't try to do deliberately. \r\n\r\nJust my opinion, what do you guys think?","replies":[{"poster":"Project Xayah","date":"2014-11-28T03:01:46.486+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"> Does anyone else think there should be a way to get around leaver-buster?\n\nNo. I don't want people who leave all the time to get around punishments. If I had my way leavebuster would be stricter. Be glad I have no power.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Klavinmour","date":"2014-11-28T06:37:45.401+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"It's your own fault for getting Leaver Busted.

From what I've read you go around just disagreeing with what ever the Discussion creator has written.","replies":[{"poster":"Klavinmour","date":"2014-11-28T22:42:34.506+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Nah.\nI'm going to disagree with you there for the sake of disagreeing with you.\n\nOP left his first match due to something that was beyond his control, after that first match he knew his internet was unstable, he knew if he played more games his connection would not be reliable.\nHe knowingly went into more matches that he knew he could not complete or be there for.\nHe knowingly made more matches unbearable for nine other players.\n\nEnd of story, he brought the wrath of Leaver Buster upon himself and he deserves what he got. Subsequently he deserves no sympathy for his actions.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Project Xayah","date":"2014-11-28T22:50:47.761+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Last I checked your post was a massive temper tantrum because you can't accept that people leave games. Riot does what they can to stop people leaving/afking but the thing with any punishment system is that it will never be 100% effective. Also I'm guessing you haven't seen the vast majority of posts Klavin has made since you think he just goes around disagreeing with people.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"unfair","date":"2014-12-14T02:08:09.062+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Great input guys ^.^ Thanks for the feedback.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Sackboy","date":"2014-11-28T06:58:11.035+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":">Does anyone else think there should be a way to get around leaver-buster?\n\nThere is, don't quit games.","replies":[]},{"poster":"JasonWazza","date":"2014-11-28T02:49:39.085+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You shouldn't leave ever, low priority queue is barely a punishment as it is.","replies":[]}]}
