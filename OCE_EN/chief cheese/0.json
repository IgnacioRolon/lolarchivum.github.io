As for questions, I can give a decent insight into the pro scene, what it&#039;s like to play professionally and various other topics about high level play. Feel free to ask me anything!\r\n\r\nJust to give some context into who I am - My name is Daniel and I&rsquo;m a 22 year old residing in Sydney, I started playing the MOBA genre way back when the extension of Warcraft 3, DOTA Allstars was popular, and have continued on with MOBAs until now. When DOTA eventually died I found myself moving onto Heroes of Newerth and when that also met the same fate, I moved onto League of Legends somewhere around the time Kog&rsquo;Maw was introduced in Season 1.\r\n\r\nAs a League player, I peaked on NA at around Diamond 2 - 90 LP, and instantly moved to the Oceanic server upon release. Since moving I have retained a Challenger rank every season, and was within the top 10 during the most recent Seasons 4 &amp; 5. My first noteworthy team in Oceania was &lsquo;Your Soul Shall Chuffer&rsquo; before moving onto Immunity and achieving a top 4 finish in the beginning of the 2015 season before the organization was banned whilst I was away in America on holiday :(.\r\n\r\nUpon return I took a few months break, was offered a few trials for teams, attended some events and was eventually given the opportunity to play for Chiefs as their midlane. I accepted the Chiefs offer and have been playing &amp; practicing with the team ever since.\r\n\r\nIf you&rsquo;d like to support me, follow me &amp; the Chiefs org on twitter:\r\n@lQdChEeSe\r\n@ChiefsESC\r\n\r\nHuge thank you to our partners Logitech G, Nvidia, Red Bull and DXRacer! You guys are the bomb.\r\n\r\nPS Im a filthy swain main\r\n\r\n {{champion:50}}  {{champion:50}}  {{champion:50}}  {{champion:50}}  {{champion:50}}  {{champion:50}}","replies":[{"poster":"SF ChrisMisTrees","date":"2016-02-26T07:38:30.516+0000","up_votes":7,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yo Daniel! So I have a bunch of questions about your time on Immunity and Chiefs!\nOther than achievements in north american soloq, the team yssc and your top four finish \nunder the team immunity organisation, what would be your proudest moment of your\nleague of legends career?\nOf the games you have played, which would be your career favorite?\nSo my favorite game of you was back on the 26th of March 2015 when you were avant vs \nteam Immunity, you were playing swain and showed your dominance with champion mastery\nto the extent of being able to control your lane with kills and presence. Sadly, you lost it\noverall due to the use of a sub jungler on Sejuani. The show of these skills, do you think in\nseason 6 will you be able to show the same type of dominance?\nFrom your no. 1 Fans ChrisMisTrees and MsFish (read the 1st letter of every sentence)","replies":[{"poster":"Chief Cheese","date":"2016-02-26T07:49:46.035+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Well there isnt much career outside of those! probly my rank 4-6 main smurf during season 4. I worked hard playing alot of swain to reach that!\nMy career favourite? i have multiple. Generally every time ive played xerath has turned out to be a strong performance full of great snipes. Much love for that champion. \nAhh yes our sub just was not prepared for competetive play and crumbled under the pressure Xsmithie style{{champion:113}} \n\nProbably wont show that same lane dominance. The way i played was very agressive since our team desperately (IMO) needed a carry. Chiefs dont need that from me to succeed, it would just make the game more volatile. \n\n and yeah. SLIGHTLY UNFORTUNATE IMO.

I couldn't just copy his style i needed to create my own whilst the team also molded their dynamic to the changes.

I also watch a lot of LCS now and that helps.\n\nTo be honest, i actually haven't heard of any rumors to do with management players?
