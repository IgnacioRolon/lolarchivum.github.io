This usually occurs because some roles are more popular than others, so the matchmaking ends up with a shortage of a particular role. It is for this same reason that auto fill usually = support. Support is the least popular role, so is usually what the shortage is, and thus what people get auto filled as most often.\n\nAfter support is usually jungle > ADC, but the popularity of the other roles varies a lot by patch/season, whereas support pretty much stays as the least popular.","replies":[{"poster":"The shade o nigt","date":"2016-11-25T04:02:48.291+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"so im guessing that auto fill is kind of like community service and if your in a certain area at a certain time you are put on duty. thats what im thinking because it doesnt seem anybody else got a fill role when i do.","replies":[{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2016-11-25T04:11:37.747+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Pretty much, it's unlikely you'd see two autofilled players in one game since it's usually a one role shortage at any given time.\n\nSome people say they'd prefer the queue times, but when the queue times are 20mins~ it's a barrier of entry for a lot of players, so while autofill isn't a perfect solution, it's generally preferable to the alternative (i.e not getting to play at all).","replies":[]}]}]}]}
