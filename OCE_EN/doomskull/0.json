He could maybe have a real darkness look like {{champion:56}} only in the form  that looks a bit like {{champion:266}}, only more death looking and giant.\nHe should be a mage. His abilities should be very dark and evil ones, like life drain, or necromancer. Maybe an undead ruler that is a little like {{champion:268}} , but turns the souls of dead minions and monsters into spirits, but instead of collecting them like {{champion:412}} they can attack other enemies for either a short duration or have a health box. Maybe his ult could be something like he turn all gigantic like {{champion:75}} , or shoot a gigantic dark fire ball that travels the map.\nRiot let me know if this sounds like a good idea for a new champion, would love feedback.","replies":[{"poster":"Mid Dumbledore","date":"2016-04-08T13:56:22.240+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Read up on Mordekaisers lore and the Blade of the Ruined King.
