Hopefully to compete in a couple of events and see how we go. \r\n\r\nPracticing is a MUST I want to be doing training exercises and general practice as well as ranked 5s, so hopefully practice a couple nights a week.\r\n\r\nI've played with and against plats and diamonds so I'd be comfy joining a team around that level if they are keen, still gotta climb out of gold though. \r\n\r\nAdd me on league to talk more: MetaHew.\r\n\r\nThanks :)","replies":[{"poster":"Frost09","date":"2015-03-20T23:32:27.191+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Join my ranked 5s team and add me in game","replies":[]}]}
