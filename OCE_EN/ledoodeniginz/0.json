To give you a bit of extra context, our original goal was to ship items to everyone with a single, low flat fare. Unfortunately it got pretty expensive shipping items like the the Ziggs statue to certain countries. That said, rather than pull the item from the store in those regions, we thought it would be better to leave the item available and increase the shipping rate to those regions.\n\nThe countries that are subject to these costs are:\n\nCanada\nMexico\nChile\nKorea\nTaiwan\nSingapore\nAustralia\nNew Zealand\n\nI hope this clarifies the cost of the order. Please let me know if you have any other questions or concerns.\n\nHidden Ki\nBilling and Account Support","replies":[]}]}
