I think you must just be having success with it because you're outskilling your opponents but since Leona scales pretty badly into the late game since you rely on a W->E->auto->Q or somewhat of a similar fashion. If you W then E to dash out and they happen to dodge that E evade you just long enough to re engage so that your W damage sets off then you are down two skills similarly to alistar when fail combo = 2 skills wasted and poor scaling i think it is okay but definitely due to its low scaling would be outclassed by well just about anything top lane with multiple stuns with better scaling and less reliance on some sort of combo burst. however Zed top's seem to do fine some of the time? Idk.\n\nAs for most fun champion. Leona is about the lowest skillcap champion that i still enjoy playing theres just something so rewarding about timing your stuns together so well that they are in a seemingly perma stun. But I've not tried Zed and I imagine him to be fun but I think if I were to pick up an assassin at this point Echo seems a little more fun to me and AD mid's in solo queue always seem to go sour when you have a full ad team just saying.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Plasmarine","date":"2015-09-10T16:23:14.110+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Leona aka Bae-ona\nReally depends on your play style tho\nIf you prefer obliterating your opponent then go Zed, or if you prefer being an unkillable wall with cray amounts of CC go Leona\n\nAlso as far as I know they're only really good at there specified lanes, I could see a Leona top probs going pretty well though","replies":[]},{"poster":"demonicslothman","date":"2015-09-10T14:58:06.241+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"{{champion:89}}  for days","replies":[]}]}
