They played with no idea, clueless and what really put it out there was all of them running out to turret at the same time and doing everything simultaneously. The reminded me of robots i felt like i was watching a beginners Bots game. So my question is Who/What are they??? Is it Riot adding bots into it because of minimal players in the game mode??? Boosters??? And if so what do we as a community do about it?","replies":[{"poster":"HORSE OF FORCE","date":"2015-04-29T10:37:20.434+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Report them after the game. I believe \"Spamming\" would do, because there's no real category for it yet. Make sure you enter in a description!\n\nYou generally don't see bots the higher MMR you have.","replies":[]}]}
