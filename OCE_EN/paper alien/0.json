{"poster":"Paper Alien","date":"2015-02-17T06:30:04.390+0000","title":"Yet another Shen rework suggestion","subforum":"Miscellaneous","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I really like playing Shen, although he's obviously past his heyday. Now I haven't played TOO much Shen or League overall (started in S4), but I've come up with a few ideas to address what I believe are the problems with Shen's current kit.\nIt seems to me that Shen's current kit has too much power budget in the infamous ult, which has left his teamfighting really mediocre. I think many people would agree that Shen nowadays doesn't do enough damage to meaningfully contribute to a teamfight, and his only real contribution is a hard-to-land taunt that's rarely used more than once a fight.\n\nHere's my suggestion of a rework to address some of these problems, with the overall focus to improve teamfighting while not making him broken:\n\n\n\nPassive: Ki Strike. Every 9/8/7 seconds instead of flat 9, deals 20/25/30% of his CURRENT health (numbers can be tweaked if needed). \n\nThis is one of the two key parts of the rework. Shen's current state as a tank with no damage means he can easily be ignored. Changing his passive to scale off his CURRENT health has a two-fold effect of improving his ability to dive carries, as well as giving incentive for the enemy to target Shen without needing to actually kill him. This overall will improve Shen's damage soaking ability and teamfight presence. This also encourages Shen to rely on sustain through Vorpal Blade during laning phase to maintain trading power.\n\n\n\n**Q: Vorpal Blade.** Healing can be increased to synergise with changes to passive and ult. \n\nPossible to change healing to scale off current health, but this might overly exaggerate Shen's \"high-health or bust\" pattern, and will also be illogical in teamfights as Shen's role as tank will still encourage him to lose health. Not that Vorpal Blade healing has any effect in big fights at all...\n\n\n\n\n**W: Feint.** Active unchanged. Passive: If 2 or more enemies are within ~800 range of Shen, Shen's movement speed is increased by 1/2/3/4/5 for every 10% of full health Shen currently has, with a maximum of 10/20/30/40/50.\n-Change 1: Added range limit.\n\nShen's other problem as a tank is his awkward initiation with his taunt. Giving him increased movespeed would alleviate problems here, but the passive is on the W, not the E, so there's a tradeoff between having movespeed and having taunt cooldown, and it's only at lategame that Shen can get both the full movespeed for easier taunts, AND the CDR for more frequent taunts.\n\n\n\n**E: Shadow Dash.** Unchanged. \n\nIf the power added to the other parts of the kit becomes a problem, the taunt's damage can be reduced/removed if necessary, but it likely won't do much in either case. The 50% damage reduction from enemy AA's may also be removed if neccesary.\n\n\n\n\n**R: Stand United.** *Now costs 30% of Shen's maximum health* (this will not take Shen below 5% health, to prevent stupid stuff like dying because you ulted into an AoE DoT). \n\nHere is the other BIG change in this rework. Shen's kit's BIGGEST problem has always been the power budget invested in his ult. The ability to turn a fight anywhere on the map has put Shen permanently on the brink of being OP. With this change, Shen will still be able to show up to help in any fight, but he will be greatly weakened (Ki Strike is weaker, movement speed may be lower), and if he was anywhere less than about 80% health when he left, he will arrive in a very vulnerable state that if not played properly will likely give the enemy team a free kill. This also adds counterplay in-lane as aggressive laners can now much more effectively keep Shen from ulting not only by interrupting his ult (which not everyone can do), but by constant harass as well. It also puts pressure on Shen to play defensively in-lane and encourages sustain via Vorpal Blade.\n\n\n\n\nOverall result (as I anticipate. I might have overlooked some things):\nShen's overall pattern; health tank that relies on outsustaining opponents through healing/trading/blocking damage, whose role in teamfights is to protect his carries or dive enemy carries, remains largely unchanged. These changes will bring an increased emphasis on continuing this pattern, and aim to streamline it. Carry diving ability and overall threat level can become much higher late game than they are now, as Ki Strike, if left unchecked, will do ludicrous amounts of damage to carries. Counterplay involves outdamaging his healing in-lane, either through burst damage or consistent ranged harass, which now has the additional effect of restricting his ult usage. \n\nDon't hesitate to point out anything you think I may have overlooked (I am aware that with these changes, Shen can build 6 Warmogs which will effectively replace boots and also give a whopping 2000 damage to his passive, although I won't yet rush to say it's a problem, as in practical use Shen might lose a good amount of this damage and speed before he manages to land his attack at all), or to explain theory to me, because I'm a very average player and while some of my understanding comes from in-game experiences, a lot of it is also from being informed by others.","replies":[{"poster":"Unseen Predator","date":"2015-02-17T07:46:29.120+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Was curious to see how good of a Shen player you were and upon seeing those runes and mastery pages i gotta say you need a lesson on how to make a proper runes and masteries page.","replies":[{"poster":"Chalze","date":"2015-02-17T15:35:36.998+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=NigguhDamus,realm=OCE,application-id=Ntey9fRZ,discussion-id=JdzJUNuE,comment-id=0003,timestamp=2015-02-17T07:46:29.120+0000)\n>\n> Was curious to see how good of a Shen player you were and upon seeing those runes and mastery pages i gotta say you need a lesson on how to make a proper runes and masteries page.\n\nYou can't really say that because his play style of Shen may be different from yours or mine.\nHis masteries may maximise his Ki Strike, but lets say personally I wanna maximise my team player potential by taking points in Expose Weakness for example.\n\nAnd man you're trying too hard to be cool when you try to mock people...","replies":[{"poster":"Unseen Predator","date":"2015-02-17T16:01:33.985+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I can say that and i did, they are bad pages, i get there are people that like to do different things according to there playstyle but some pages are just bad.\n\nNot trying to be cool nor am i mocking him, all i did was say he needs a lesson on how to make a runes and masteries page, he is Bronze after all.\n\nDon't just automatically assume every comment is negative.","replies":[{"poster":"Chalze","date":"2015-02-17T16:09:42.734+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=NigguhDamus,realm=OCE,application-id=Ntey9fRZ,discussion-id=JdzJUNuE,comment-id=000300000000,timestamp=2015-02-17T16:01:33.985+0000)\n>\n> I can say that and i did, they are bad pages, i get there are people that like to do different things according to there playstyle but some pages are just bad.\n> \n> Not trying to be cool nor am i mocking him, all i did was say he needs a lesson on how to make a runes and masteries page, he is Bronze after all.\n> \n> Don't just automatically assume every comment is negative.\n\nNo one has to take 'lessons' on masteries and runes man.

I feel like the health cost is a fairly meaningful change instead of simply restricting the ult range like the other global teles. I also feel that these changes make him much more interactive rather than before where he was just \"Q-W trade in-lane, taunt in fights.\" Works great if he's in meta, suddenly completely useless when he's out of meta.\n\nBut seriously dude, you don't even know me. My problem with playing as Shen is not losing lane. It turns out his taunt does so much minion damage that I usually win my lane. The problem is that no matter how well I do, Shen is not very good for snowballing, as opposed to say, Jax. And I'm fine with that, Shen is a tank and not a carry. I'm not fine with you thinking you know better than me *just* because I'm Bronze (you seem to have experience of Shen back in the day, I'm willing to listen to that). The states can lie. Playing carries and playing supports/tanks will get you very different rankings for the same level of overall skill. I've had 2 provisional games where my bot lane adc or sup afk'd. But according to you runes would change that.","replies":[{"poster":"Unseen Predator","date":"2015-02-18T08:58:26.140+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You're forgetting that it costing his health makes no sense, Vlad uses his blood, Mordekaiser uses pieces of himself, but what does Shen use?

Of course my turret has been destroyed first countless times when I really have to Stand United with an ally but thats ok as Shen.\n\nPassive - Ki Strike\nThis is somewhat overpowered, especially in the scalings. I think a constant 20%-ish will hurt already throughout all stages of the game. Remember, Shen’s normal build is supposed to be around 4000+ HP and Shen’s a tank, meaning he’s not meant to lose a lot of HP in fights, meaning he can keep proc’ing his passive. However, this does have a psychological effect on enemy players in wanting to target him more due to the lower Shen is, the less his passive will hurt, so this somewhat works if it scales with current health.\n\nQ - Vorpal Blade\nVorpal Blade hasn’t exactly got a huge use in team fights as the heal procs off ally auto attacks, and usually the one auto attacking the most are the ADCs, which usually aim for the enemy squishies who don’t exactly live long enough to let your ally ADC heal enough. However when it comes to doing Baron or Dragon, a single Vorpal Blade can heal a ton since there is no heal stack cap and Vorpal Blade is free to spam. But I get your meaning.\n\nW - Feint\n\nThe passive on the Feint is quite nice actually, however I’m not too sure if Shen really needs it. He’s already got a dash which is target direction meaning he has enough escapes, however for initiating, 10/20/30/40/50 movement speed is nifty, but this will ‘taunt’ enemies to use up their kiting CC on you (which can be good or bad).\nHowever remember that giving this passive is only a buff and has hardly any downsides to his stats as no matter what Shen will practically always have 10 bonus movement speed for 90% of the game. Yes, it’s not much, but it is still a solid buff.\n\nE - Shadow Dash\nActive unchanged, however his 50% damage reduction is fine as it is. It’s what makes Shen a tank after all.\n\nR - Stand United\nMaking the ultimate cost health will make Shen’s popularity (and effectiveness) drop to practically naught. Shen’s hurt enough by leaving his lane all of a sudden, and he’s already penalised for the lack of communication for your now-Stand-United ally to run closer to enemies for the taunt range. Nerfing Shen in such an illogical way is just unsuitable for such a champion. This will definitely make Shen players not want to ult as much.\n\nShen is a champion which can be said to be a little overpowered, however he’s really not, he’s insanely balanced right now.\nAlthough he’s got practically everything a top laner wants:\nUnmissable poke as a form of offence\nSelf-shield as a form of defence\nDash as a form of defence\nDash with taunt as a form of offence\nGlobal Ultimate\nBursts of damage\nSpammable abilities\nManaless (as long as you wait for energy regen)\nTanky\nAll of these have been toned down. His poke damage isn’t that great, and neither is the range. His self shield has a somewhat mediocre scaling compared to other tanks with self shields. His dash isn’t that long. His dash taunt is narrow with a long cool down. His global ultimate has a long channel time. The fax that his global ultimate IS a channel making him prone to CC. His bursts of damage on his Ki Strike isn’t that much and doesn’t happen that frequently. His abilities are spammable and he’s manaless but then again he still has a somewhat limited resource cost on his abilities. He’s a tank yeah, but many other tanks do more damage and CC than Shen does.\n\nShen is really in the spot that he should be, but if I were to recommend a buff, I would buff nothing but his Shadow Dash to make it have 220 base damage with 60% AP scaling…that way all of his basic abilities scale the same lol.\n\n\n\n\n\nBy the way Riot should remove the function of his Q being able to heal enemies when thrown on a neutral monster.

I don't believe that the tank should be keeping his health high in a teamfight. Ideally for the tank, he should take damage instead of his carries. I thought that was the common consensus. In any case, my concerns with Shen's teamfighting are primarily from the fact that sometimes I feel like I can't do enough in a fight after my taunt. I often end up having way too much health than I want while most of my carries are dead. \n\nI am also aware that Shen's kit is more focused on skirmishes and small fights and perhaps he's meant to be weak at teamfights (after all, his taunt is fairly weak at initiating compared to some other characters, but I accept that). These changes can be intended as (rather strong) quality of life buffs. I wouldn't want them to completely revolutionise his teamfights. He still has to depend on a narrow, high CD taunt, but now he can be more effective in the downtime. In retrospect, permanent 40~ speed boost may be a bit unneccesarily strong. Maybe change it to be when there's 2 or more enemies in a ~800 (fairly small, only really in heated fights) radius.\n\nThe ult change was an attempt to divert the power budget of Shen's kit in a way I thought was meaningful. I do understand that Shen ulting already carries a lot of sacrifices and is *extremely* punishing if misused, and I haven't quite observed in depth where its power came from back in Shen's heyday, but my assumption was that at high levels it was primarily the fact that Shen could appear in any fight, possibly at full health, and 3v2/clean-up and turn fights. I don't know if that's neccesarily true, it's one of the areas I would like extra advice on. I made this change assuming that in high level play, a lot of problems (miscommunications etc) are reduced enough that the ult in its current state is still overwhelmingly powerful. I don't think it would be possible to balance Shen's ult for low level play at the same time.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Chalze","date":"2015-02-17T07:03:45.501+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"As an avid (Warlord) Shen player like you who has played Shen for a while, lemme analyse this and reply.\n\nI shall reply soon-ish.","replies":[]}]}
