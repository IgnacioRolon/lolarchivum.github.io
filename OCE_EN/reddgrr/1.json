How do I get lower","subforum":"Help & Support (OCE)","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hi. After a winning streak with support Taric, I have been placed into games (talking Normal) where I constantly face Silver, Gold or Platinum ranked players. I end up feeding, being shout at, myself becoming toxic, screwing up the game, leaving, demoralizing .... constantly loosing (lost 12 games in a row now) and the game pretty much suck for me. Whats the point of playing, when you got shut down on level 2 or 3 by simply better ADCs, better junglers, or whatever. Not any aspect of fun, neither a possibility to improve. All focus I place into after 5 minutes of the game, is either apologizing, fighting with my own team, or forcing surrender.\r\n\r\nQuestion is - how do I get into lower seeded game? Lost 12 in a row now and I am still facing silver fukers. Any advice would help to imrpove the game for me and also for any of my future teammates. And no, I will not create new account to feed Riot with money ....","replies":[{"poster":"HORSE OF FORCE","date":"2015-01-14T06:44:37.706+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Making a new account will not give Riot money. If anything, it costs them more to store the account on their servers.\n\nAnyway, that must have been one hell of a winning streak to get you so incredibly high into matchmaking. Any chance you were playing with someone else in your queue? But aside from that, if you're losing games constantly, your MMR should balance back out.\n\nJust some tips though, don't rage at your team, or force a surrender. A part of the game is learning from experiences. Being on the losing side of a game would give you the most insight, allow to you see what *could* have been done to change the game.\n\nThere's no way you can \"force\" yourself into a lower seeded game. Your MMR is based off of your skill.","replies":[{"poster":"REDDGrr","date":"2015-01-14T09:10:27.910+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"One more thing to note - raging starts since champion selection screen - therefore I was always \"fill\" in pathetic hope to avoid early toxicity. But idiots will always fight for mid or top. Then one player screws up and hell unleashes immediately, without me participating in that. Players are toxic to me when I screw up my lane, I am being frustrated that I play games I do not want to, and when its like that every bloody time, I just started being toxic.","replies":[{"poster":"HORSE OF FORCE","date":"2015-01-16T02:59:49.608+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"That's um, that just doesn't happen.\n\nMaybe you'd find a toxic player once every tenth game. No way you'd have excessive amounts every game. Maybe it's being a bit skewered by the school holidays, though, I'll give you that. Additionally, it's preseason, people just don't care as much (doesn't explain why they're playing ranked, but oh well).\n\nAbout your MMR again, if you were in games with bronze players, and everything was fine and you won, then your MMR will be increased, because you won. Just purely the attitude of your team mates doesn't dictate what's going to happen in game.\n\nI'm at a loss of what to do to help you, I'm sorry. Try holding out until at least the school holidays are over, a lot of the toxicity you're seeing should be gone.\n\nBest of luck finding enjoyable games.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"REDDGrr","date":"2015-01-14T09:06:55.910+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I've used to play on this account like 2 years back. I stopped playing because of known issue \"attempt to reconnect\" happening every third game, anyway, did like 400 games there. Now I have finally solved this issue (changed computer - did not helped, changed router -> problem solved). Well, then I won some games, all players on the loading screen had no silver, gold or platinum portrait icons, everyone was nicely bronze. And then bang, since then, every game there are silver, gold and platinum players on my side, me usually being the only one without any colored borders. I presume the enemy team is the same, but on loading screen you cannot see it. Its like that now for 12th game in a row and I constantly being outplayed heavily.","replies":[]}]}
