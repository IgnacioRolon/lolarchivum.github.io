In a pursuing my goal to perfection, I restart the game often and over time (over tens and hundreds of restarts) setting the game is just never-ending and increasingly annoying. Can we have a restart button in the game, that would skip setting the game up? There could be a warning / confirm button, that if we restart the game, stats would not be calculated / displayed, but who cares about stats? ;p only nerds.","replies":[{"poster":"Area2609","date":"2015-01-13T21:28:26.932+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Don't lie, your not a noob...","replies":[{"poster":"Newguy","date":"2015-01-20T09:36:11.247+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Area2609,realm=OCE,application-id=hIjvqaz6,discussion-id=6EwArGpI,comment-id=0000,timestamp=2015-01-13T21:28:26.932+0000)\n>\n> Don't lie, your not a noob...\n\nDid you mean they own \"not a noob...\" or did you mean \"they're not a noob...\"?\n\nYour sentence has confused me, and I'd like to know what you're meaning to say","replies":[{"poster":"Area2609","date":"2015-01-22T02:57:58.702+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Is that a rocket in your pocket?
