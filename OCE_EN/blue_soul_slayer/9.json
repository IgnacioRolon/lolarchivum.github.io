Are you deliberately trying to block one of the ways that the community can express their ideas?\r\nComments are gone or are currently afk. I only notice this when I was looking at a webpage for the eternals and dev posts, etc. When riot posts something, I enjoyed reading the comments because some people write down what they think of it and people can get to choose to agree or to disagree with it. Most of the posts have comments that express how the community feels about the post and it can quickly show riot what the majority are thinking. Even though there are other unrelated conversations, they were funny or interesting to read. \r\n{{sticker:zombie-nunu-bummed}} \r\n\r\n**Eternals:**\r\nOh boy they got me in the first half. I ain't gonna lie, it was looking fine until they showed how you can get them. RP &amp; BE thats ridiculous and to top that off its going to expensive. (They've done some dumb expensive choices. Like the little legends. They cost so much for one and i can only use one at a time. Evolving them is even more stupid because getting the little legend you want is random (depends on what you open).) So I have to play and grind to get BE to unlock champions. Oh wait. it's based on levels? Wait there's more? Yep. normally I only get a champion capsule. :( Why would someone pay money or grind for be for some stats? Will all the things I've done count? Will all the things I've done after its been released into live servers count? Do I have to buy them so it would start counting my stats?\r\n{{sticker:sg-lux-2}} \r\nAnother annoying thing I saw was:\r\n\"Goal 1: Create more skill-expressive and exciting stats to track\r\nMany of you told us our first series of Eternals wasn’t exciting enough and didn’t let you show off your skill in the ways you wanted. To address this, we've added two more Unique Eternals per champion to their launch sets, with an emphasis on capturing the high moments unique to each champion. Here’s an example of how one champion’s set evolved to be more skill expressive based on this feedback:\r\n\r\nVladimir’s Original Series 1 Set:\r\nMultiple (2+) enemy champions hit by Hemoplague (R)\r\nDuration of enemy champions slowed by abilities, items, and runes\r\nEnemy champions killed\r\n\r\nVladimir’s New Series 1 Set:\r\nMultiple (2+) enemy champions hit by Hemoplague (R)\r\nTransfusions (Q) empowered by Crimson Rush (QP) used on enemy champions\r\nSkillshot missiles dodged with Sanguine Pool (W)\"\r\nThe new series is how riot should've made them in the **first place**.\r\n{{sticker:slayer-jinx-unamused}}\r\n \r\n\"In addition to the Starter Series, we’ll also be releasing Eternal Capsules as an additional free reward in Ranked Splits.\"\r\nThis irritated me because I currently have no interest in playing rank right now. (Reminds me of clash because there was a gold circle notification that wouldn't go away because I haven't finished my rank promos. (Until the new update.)) I really don't enjoy being told what to do. What about people who don't play rank?\r\n{{sticker:sg-janna}} \r\n\r\n\"The Starter Series Pass will be available for 14750 Blue Essence or 1350 RP.\"\r\nYes. Grinding seems fun. \r\n{{sticker:sg-ahri-3}} \r\n\r\n\r\n**TFT(Mobile):**\r\n(Some of these are related to the PC version)\r\nIn-game: \r\nChat? \r\nLittle Legends ctrl+1,2,3?\r\n\"STYLE ON ‘EM\r\nExpress yourself with your Little Legend by dancing, emoting, and generally showing off...\"\r\n-Tapping feels slow. When switching between players/dmg stats/players.\r\n-Champions images look bad. \r\n? Why not use the original splash art?\r\n+ Origins are used as their background colours.\r\n- It's obvious vsing a mobile player (new account just to play tft) because they have no account icon.\r\n- When losing rounds, the X should be put on the Little legends icon instead of the number of health.\r\n? red X on grey LL icon + death animation. Something like when you ban champs in lol and the icon does this cool twist and cut effect? I'm not asking for a big animation, just something subtle and nice.\r\nLobby:\r\n- Weird how offline people are forced to have the default little legends as their profile icon. \r\n? Could just grey it out or have a icon for which game they are playing instead of \" here you go default blob for you\".\r\n- Annoying to scroll to find the little legends you want and is annoying to search for the little legends you want. \r\n? It should be sorted by availability/owned little legends.\r\n- Waiting in queue is boring. \r\n?There should be a indicator or counter or something to show the unknown amount of people I'm waiting for? \r\nOr\r\nYou could fill up the empty spaces with the people in the same lobby as you. Obviously while hiding their names. So like a silhouette in your lobby with their little legends shown.\r\n-No promotion animation. That's just very sad. :'(","replies":[{"poster":"Say No to Krugs","date":"2020-02-27T13:00:26.621+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Some very good points about TFT , I went right off TFT when the mobile hit oce server. \nI think mobile TFT should  be separate till the mobile TFT client has all the features of pc TFT.\nFeels lonely going up against 7 river sprites and no point saying GG when your the only one in game with chat.\nAlso should of had some type of protection so it was OCE mobile users only.","replies":[]}]}
