(Which is highly unlikely because he specifically directed it towards me.)\r\nI&#039;m not complaining about abusive language / verbal abuse because i couldn&#039;t care about what people say. But I do care when people can&#039;t see how hard i&#039;m trying.\r\nOh and i accidentally reported a report half finish (on the new client) because I wanted to write on a new line, so I shift + enter but that just sent that straight away. So i think Reporting a Player should have shift + enter for a new line. (The boards should also have a feature where you can just copy and paste images into the discussion.)","replies":[]}
