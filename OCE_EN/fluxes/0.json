Constant feeding, grieving and purposeful AFK&#039;s aren&#039;t enough for and individual to be banned/punished these days. Riot has gone soft. Maybe it is because they wish to maintain their already depleting player base in this region. Ridding the game of the majority of it&#039;s toxic players just about destroys their game. It is time for someone to actually do something about this. Now I&#039;m sure that just being one player having a go doesn&#039;t mean much, but I would believe many players have felt the effect of a player not having any of it, and throwing a game down the drain. Grow a pair and start dishing out some punishments. Players that experience the tribunal are, after all, less likely to repeat actions again, remember?","replies":[{"poster":"Lord Sesshomaru","date":"2018-04-03T13:03:23.992+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I tend to chuckle with these \"OCE IS THE WORST SERVER!\" posts. Just becasue of the flawed logic behind them.\n\nThe only thing that makes OCE different than the rest of the world is the players. \nIn other words: **Us.**\n\nSo bitching about OCE and blaming Riot is essentially saying:\n_\"Im such a toxic player, Why isn't Riot forcing me to be less toxic! Its all their fault!\"_\n\nTo my knowledge, we have the same player behaviour systems as everywhere else _(with just a few changes to blacklisted words to accomodate for cultural differences)_. So if OCE really is that much more toxic than everywhere else _(which statistically I doubt)_, the only thing that makes it that way is **us**, so really it's our own responsibility to fix it, don't you think?\n\nI think Seras has hit the nail on the head with:\n> someone who plays 10 games on EUW has a pretty good chance of dodging negativity, compared to the 2000 they've played on OCE where they're basically guaranteed to have experienced some form of negative behaviour.\n\nIt's no different to how we all see our own champ as _'in need of a buff'_ and we always see the enemy champ as _'OP'_. \nAnd just like how players on your team are always trash, and players on the enemy team are always challenger smurfs.\n\nIn reality its all pretty much even, but it doesn't feel like that becasue its human nature for negative experiences to be more notable than positive ones. _(its a survival instinct)_.\n\nWe perceive everything we don't have as always being better than everything we do have.\n_\"That guy is so lucky! he has a Ferrari.\"_ Says Joe from the deck of his 60ft pleasure Yacht.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2018-04-03T12:03:36.879+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"There's some long discussion over here you might find interesting: https://boards.oce.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/player-behaviour/7WEIAUEn-can-we-discuss-the-punishment-systems\n\nAs an added and more specific note as well, while chat punishments do differ by region, gameplay punishments are typically very similar if not the same (i.e something that will get you punished on NA will also get you punished here), so for gameplay what you're describing isn't so much an OCE thing as a League thing.\n\nRemoving toxic players actually strengthens a community. New players especially are *far* more likely to abandon a game (as in League not as in a particular match) if they encounter toxicity, and the number of players negatively affected by one toxic player far outweighs removing that one toxic player.\n\nEvery online game struggles with toxicity. Sometimes it's just much easier said than done to remove those toxic players, especially in a free to play game like League where it's incredibly easy to create a fresh account. If you go to say, the Overwatch forums you'll see the exact same themes (\"why do intent feeders not get punished\", \"why is this game so toxic\") and OW *isn't* free to play. If you get your account banned you're forking over $60 for a new one.\n\nIt's not a matter of \"we don't want to punish toxic players\" it's more \"we do our best to stay ahead of the curve and adapt as quickly as possible, but it's just not possible to eliminate toxicity entirely\".","replies":[]},{"poster":"colossalJinx","date":"2018-04-03T11:43:59.492+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Are you kidding me? \n\"the OCE servers are the biggest failure of League of Legends\"\nMaybe attention-wise by being the buggiest,\nBut seriously? Player behaviour?\n\nHave you played LAN? Turkey?\nHave you played PBE??\nWhere these things ACTUALLY happen, frequently? \n\nI agree with what you're saying, the current punishment system is fucking horrible, one fortnight ban then perma? So dumb, for actual good players too. \nBut honestly... Community-wise, OCE is a blessing of a server lmao, the people here are friendly most of the time & the ones that aren't are either having a bad day or are children.","replies":[{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2018-04-03T11:57:26.294+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Remember that negativity bias and experience bias are things.

If their experience was overall positive on NA because they enjoyed the game, then that's the impression they'll keep, as opposed to the impression they'd have if their game 2 hours ago here on OCE was a toxic one.\n\nI guarantee you there are people on every region that say that region they play on is the most toxic simply because they have a limited experience with x other region. There are also those people that will say the complete opposite for exactly the same reason.","replies":[]},{"poster":"colossalJinx","date":"2018-04-03T11:44:45.950+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"è . é why am I logged into my EUWE account","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Mı Ke","date":"2018-04-04T19:35:10.209+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"There are few ways that you can adapt\nMuting all is one of them. It helps you focus on your plays and reduce mistakes. Instead of spamming chat with someone who is toxic, you can just ignore them and find a way to win. That's why Midbeast and Dopa advocate to mute all at the beginning of the game and ping for comms. The only role that  impacts directly to your role especially early game is Jungle if you play Top or Mid so you can leave him/her unmuted","replies":[]}]}
