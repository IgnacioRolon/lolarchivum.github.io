We then all started walking to base. \r\nI seem to be doing the best out of all my teammates, and the one time the enemy Thresh unpaused the game, I was first to reconnect. I even thought at first that Thresh was a member of Rito (yeah how dumb), until the enemy Corki started going &quot;WTF this Thresh... he can pause and unpause the game... Thresh... WTF&quot; before it froze again. \r\nI tried &#039;/resume,&#039; and it worked, but only after quite a long period of time. During then I moved a bit and the Corki sent a few more &quot;WTF...&quot; messages before I was back to &#039;attempting to reconnect.&#039; This happened a few more times and now I&#039;m back at base, while on my frozen screen Thresh and Corki are at our tower and pushing? Most likely. \r\nI&#039;ve asked quite a few people if their games are working, and theirs are completely fine. \r\nIf this really is Thresh&#039;s doing - well it&#039;s unfair obviously and a bloody boring game ._. \r\nSomeone offer a solution please? I&#039;ll love you forever &lt;3.\r\n\r\nEDIT: So I just realised the screen was on the &#039;skip waiting for stat&#039;s thing, and when I looked at my match history there was nothing there. TFW? 30 minutes of my time wasted. Is there anyone out there who has an explanation?","replies":[{"poster":"HORSE OF FORCE","date":"2015-05-09T03:10:43.383+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"During a custom game, you can pause it by issuing the /pause command and having the majority of people vote \"Yes\".
