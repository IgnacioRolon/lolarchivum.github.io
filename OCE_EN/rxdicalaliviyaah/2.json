Now I have high-tech internet, and while it slows at 33%, it doesn't stop. It DOES actually slow to 0 kbps occasionally, but if you wait, it'll probably start up again (just like yours did).

Of course, once it starts, after a while, you can switch it back to oceania (:\n\nThat's what I did this morning when I fixed it, I actually accidentally finished patching it on NA but I switched it back to OCE and it patched again super quickly, and now I'm able to play completely fine. \n\nLet me know what happens to yours! :D","replies":[{"poster":"Sha4o4","date":"2015-01-15T02:30:29.130+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=rxdicalaliviyaah,realm=OCE,application-id=ElA0rvVL,discussion-id=wouH0bhH,comment-id=00010000000100000000000000000000,timestamp=2015-01-14T13:07:26.738+0000)\n>\n> Yeah, y'know I had bad internet before I changed my modem and it always got stuck at 33%.
