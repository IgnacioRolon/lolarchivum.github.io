As of now, Arclight Vel is the only one for sale; Warring Kingdoms Kat & Nid and Firecracker Jinx are THERE if you click on the champ and flick through the skins, but it comes up as unavailable to buy. \n\nI did see something about how they're out on PBE server, not normal, and if that's the case, **does anyone know when they WILL be out on normal?** I might be dumb or something, but I'm quite sure they're supposed to be out right now, since patch 5.2 has updated and all (plus Vel skin is out, and so is the Atlantic icon). \n\nI might have missed something big which is why I'm asking, and they might just not be out since patch 5.2 JUST updated, and it's going to take a little while,  but I'm asking even if this is a stupid question :P \n\nTHANKS!\n\nEDIT: Oh god yes I'm stupid, I submitted this in the wrong topic and now I can't change it haha but still hoping one of you will take 2 mins to give me a quick answer!

Was just waiting for someone to give a quick but to-the-point comment detailing just exactly about when the new skins are out. \nThe Annie skin doesn't interest me that much, but I did realise and not take in that the other skins were for Chinese New Year. I actually don't play Nid, but I've been looking for a new flashy Kat skin for ages, and this is it. Nice to know that it doesn't stay forever, I'll be buying it straight away (: \nSomeone will be gifting me the Jinx, and I'll see about the Nid. \n\nAll in all, great post, great answer, saved my day. I don't want to wait, but I've waited ages, can wait more. \nThanks again.","replies":[]}]}]}
