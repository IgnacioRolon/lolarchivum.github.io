Account got hacked and transferred into EU West.","subforum":"Help & Support (OCE)","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"RITO, please look into this! \r\nI haven't been playing League for 3 weeks due to school and other things. So today, since I had time, I reckoned I'd have a game. \r\nUntil. \r\nI tried to log on, and it gave me a \"your account has been transferred.\" \r\nSo I spent another 10 minutes trying username, password and server combinations until I could log into the LoL website. IT TURNED OUT I'D BEEN TRANSFERRED TO EU WEST. \r\nMost things were the same obviously, the wins, level, and my rp and skins were almost all present. And having all of my 12 449 rp (yes I'm invested) was strange. Because the account transfer costs rp obviously, which paints a pretty clear picture I was hacked. Plus I had no honours, and only one game in my match history, played by the hacker I assume. I WAS ALSO MISSING DJ SONA, WHICH I SWEAR I BOUGHT THE DAY IT CAME OUT, ON SALE!!\r\n\r\nSo the title is a bit misleading I see now, because just then I gave up and payed the 2600 RP to transfer back to OCE. Which I shouldn't have had to do! Everything is back in order, my friends, match history and honours, and all of my skins EXCEPT DJ SONA. Honestly, I don't want to spend to much on League (more than $250), not play for a few weeks and then have everything shoved around in my face. \r\nJust to play normally, I've had to pay 2600 RP and on top of that I don't have an ultimate skin worth more than 3000. Anyone who doesn't believe me on that, I have Pulsefire Ezreal and he's still there thank god. \r\nJust RITO PLEASE, that uneccesary 2600 rp I had to pay and also my Sona skin. Do I have to log on now every single day to ensure my account is safe?","replies":[{"poster":"HORSE OF FORCE","date":"2015-03-21T10:05:40.276+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"If you believe your account has been hacked, then make a support ticket immediately.
