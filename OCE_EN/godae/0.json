I am making this forum post for him because he doesn&#039;t have an account.  They hacked his password and username on the website. The website then gave them his email address which had the same password as his league account. He doesn&#039;t know how to recover it from now. We have all the previous information even his purchases from his paypal. His last known summoner name was Fact . They havent played a game or changed the name yet. We can confirm that they changed everything because we found the email in his inbox. Is there anything we can do.","replies":[{"poster":"SephirothSG","date":"2016-01-12T04:19:28.559+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey man,\n\nSorry to hear your friend got his account stolen, that's no good.\n\nThe first course of action would be for either you or your friend to [submit a ticket](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/requests/new) to Player Support to have the account locked so no unauthorised purchases can be made, your friend should then ensure his computer is free from malware and all of his accounts that utilise the same name/email/password are secure.\n\nOnce that is done your friend will need to begin the [account recovery process](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201751694-Recovering-Your-Account), however it sounds as if his email was changed so he will need to [submit a ticket](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/requests/new).\n\nHope this helps.","replies":[]}]}
