Maybe you remember a big payday and buying $100 in RP?","replies":[{"poster":"Yeoreum","date":"2018-02-12T01:07:14.600+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I sent them information like that but unfortunately it wasnt enough.","replies":[{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2018-02-12T01:35:31.691+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You'll just have to go digging for more info then I'm afraid.
