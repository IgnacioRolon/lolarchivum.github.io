Any information that is unique to the account but not visible on it. \n\nSay you remember buying SKT Zac the day it came out, or maybe you know Annie in Wonderland was a mystery gift (bonus points if you know from who). Maybe you know you bought Jinx with RP because you were so hyped for her and didn't have enough IP.\n\nMaybe, you bought all your RP with prepaid cards and you still have some of them lying around somewhere, or maybe you always used paypal.\n\nAny details on sources of skins/champs/payments and any more specific times of purchase you can give (has to be better than just a year for skins because you can see that on the account) are all incredibly useful, even if you only go a year or so back.
