They're hardly going to return an account to someone who isn't the original owner, so if ownership can't be determined for whatever reason they can't return the account and it will remain banned.\n\nIf an account was banned for boosting, it should be pretty clear why that's not allowed.","replies":[{"poster":"Yeoreum","date":"2018-05-11T11:52:32.717+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"If you can prove the original owner can I get unbanned after they stated that my account wont get unbanned and thats their final decision \n?","replies":[{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2018-05-11T14:32:02.042+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"From what I understand from the tickets you posted previously the answer would be no.
