Mostly these cases involve some kind of account sharing, and in the event of compromise it makes it almost impossible to determine the original owner because the information needed to prove that is spread amongst different people.\n\nThis is part of the reason account sharing is against the ToS. While non malicious account sharing isn't typically punished, it leaves you vulnerable in such circumstances. If Riot can't determine who the original owner of the account is, they can't return the account. Why would they give an account to someone they aren't sure was it's creator? That would be like playing stranger roulette with a wallet you picked up instead of just handing it in to lost and found.","replies":[{"poster":"Yeoreum","date":"2018-04-22T13:17:32.402+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"But why would they recover the account when only the original email was given in the account recovery support ticket ?","replies":[{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2018-04-22T14:05:04.045+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I think he probably just reset the password. If he submitted an account recovery at that time just the email isn't enough, they ask you a long list of questions unique to the account. A password reset as far as I know only requires access to the attached email address (at which point means your email is compromised as well if they were capable of receiving that).","replies":[{"poster":"Yeoreum","date":"2018-04-23T06:55:53.467+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"My email had phone verification on it and i wouldve gotten an email notification from Riot if he requested a reset email.

Responses like that (they said that accounts that have been compromised frequently pose a risk for other player) usually mean one of two things. Lots of compromise and little effort to secure the account (it's realistic to expect an account to get compromised once, but for it to happen persistently means something ain't right), or multiple people with access to the account trying to recover it at once. Both of which result in the account staying banned.\n\nI don't know if it's what happened in your case, but if you spent money on an account that you shared with a friend and then had a falling out (often the situation in cases like these) that's not Riot's responsibility.","replies":[{"poster":"Yeoreum","date":"2018-04-23T10:50:19.358+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It hasnt been compromised before and how do i even put little effort into securing my account ?

Riot isn't (and can't be) responsible for stuff like that. It's true that Riot don't have 2fa and that kinda sucks, but you wouldn't get a response like that from support lightly, and it very much leads me to believe that there were multiple people with access to the account, and probably multiple people trying to recover it.","replies":[{"poster":"Yeoreum","date":"2018-04-23T12:36:27.106+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It wasnt secured then compromised, it was the first time it got compromised in 7 years and email addresses are seen everywhere lately and they just gave the original and riot decided that they were the original owner.","replies":[{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2018-04-24T09:30:08.812+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Like I said, I don't know what else to tell you. That's not how account recoveries work. You can do a password reset with just the original email, but not an account recovery.

They won't overturn a ban like that.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]}
