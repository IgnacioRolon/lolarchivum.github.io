These are all of the things i think you need to know:\r\nprimary role: assassin\r\nsecondary role:   ???      (fighter or a mage)\r\npassive: after 2 attacks on a single enemy the next attack will give slow or burn for ???s (1.5s or 2.5s)\r\nr:throws his blade in a selected direction and teleports there. if blade hits an enemy it teleports to enemy and deals normal damage.\r\nq: does a spin attack like Garen {{champion:86}} exactly the same thing\r\nw: stabs himself with his blade which gives him a certain amount of health ??? but also gives slow\r\ne: ??? (possibly Master Yi&#039;s {{champion:11}} alpha strike)\r\nlore: ??? (he has blades that are either ice or blue fire depending on the scenario so be imaginative you guys are good at that stuff)\r\nstats: attack should be high. health around mid. ability power should be mid. and difficulty high or mid.\r\nimage: https://hydra-media.cursecdn.com/hearthstone.gamepedia.com/thumb/8/82/Nightblade_full.jpg/400px-Nightblade_full.jpg?version=255b9ab58e306f9a50459005056af46c\r\n\r\n\r\nplease add this champion to the game i would be for ever thankful\r\nKind regards AndrewCrafter\r\n(Night Blade: My blade will taste your neck)","replies":[{"poster":"ohmu","date":"2016-06-25T11:45:29.005+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Oh I don't know, maybe because you directly stole other champions abilities and used a boring 3 hit passive, because we haven't seen that in like 6 OTHER CHAMPIONS.
