However I often find myself in situations where I am forced to play mid despite my best efforts. So I was wondering, what are some champs, that I can main, that can be play at both mid and top effectively?","replies":[{"poster":"WandererYoshinon","date":"2018-06-26T11:55:08.829+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Galio.

Yasuo is another one (I find quite a number of Yasuo mid in this season even though he was also occasionally played top).\nI also find that teemo was being played in top lane frequently, but he can also be played in mid lane.\nAny champion can go anywhere, it is just that sometimes one champion may be weak in certain lanes/roles (depends on who he/she face). Sometimes ADC's like Vayne may end up top lane anyway.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Orange Caramel","date":"2018-06-21T13:23:36.763+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XDJpCcGHYAg","replies":[]},{"poster":"BurningAvalanche","date":"2018-06-21T11:00:49.542+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yasuo, Irelia, Vlad, Cassio, Ryze, Ekko, Galio, Gangplank, Jayce, Malz, Nasus, Riven, 'Shaco' (Might be difficult mid), Swain, Talon, Yasuo, Zed, Wukong.\n\nTake your pick lol.","replies":[]},{"poster":"NeedSomeSalt","date":"2018-06-21T10:51:17.607+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Heimerdinger, Talon, Lissandra, Yasuo, Irelia and Teemo.
