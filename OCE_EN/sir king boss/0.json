Yes, it will take forever but should be worth it in the long run. \n\nIf the patcher keeps crashing or your internet bugs out, when you reopen the launcher, it will take longer to download and scan the files. Why, because your computer has already downloaded the files but not installed them. The launcher scans over them but does't recognize them as installed files (which is why it keeps scanning 25k files). This takes up more time and it also downloads slower due to more files in the folder. This is my explanation for this and by no means is correct or what Riot have said to do.\n\nI've had trouble downloading patches in the past so hope this helps.\n\nDW","replies":[]},{"poster":"djsilver","date":"2015-03-18T01:33:04.318+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Run chkdsk on your league install drive.\n\nRun repair on client from launcher window. \n\nWait a really long time, but hopefully it will be worth it in the long run.","replies":[]}]}
