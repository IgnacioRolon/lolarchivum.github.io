A basic summary: if you have lower MMR than the people you beat, you gain more LP. If you have more MMR than the people you beat, you gain less LP. You gain MMR for every victory you have against higher skilled players, and lose MMR if you lose against lower skilled players.\n\nIf you just started playing again from three years ago, then it's most likely your MMR has decayed to be really low (MMR decays faster than division rating does). You'll have to play plenty of games before it goes back up, and even if you win them all, since you won against people of lower skill level, you won't gain much MMR.\n\nHope that helps.","replies":[]}]}
