Also, everyone likes an Aussie accent xD\n\nThere is *one big, glaring problem*, however... your audio is garbage. Not in the sense that there's a lot of background noise, but rather the fact it is sooooooooo quiet. The only way I can hear it is if I have my volume set to 100. The same holds true in the TF video, where the music is super quiet. This could be down to how you record your audio, or it could be happening during editing/post-production.\n\nHope this helps, and keep up the good videos :D\n\n{{sticker:slayer-jinx-wink}}","replies":[{"poster":"Abbdog","date":"2017-08-15T01:28:23.832+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thanks mate! I've had a lot of feedback in regards to my audio being low. I'm thinking I might just bump it up a bit in Sony Vegas and hopefully that will fix it. Thanks a lot!","replies":[]}]}]}
