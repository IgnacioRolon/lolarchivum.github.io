There are millions of players but you are forced to play with the same assholes over and over even after blocking them because yolo. I have met similar people, unfortunately calling someone an \"N word\" does not count unless you spell the full word. Nigge.r See? I have a 'black' list of people I avoid playing with because I know how bad or toxic they can be. I check them every game and just dodge whenever I see the same name. I even have a counter next to their name of how many times I meet them in matchup and how many times they've let the team down. Unfortunately you are the one getting a penalty for avoiding toxicity and dodging a potentially unpleasant 30 mins of gaming.","replies":[{"poster":"Exarch Leona","date":"2019-06-13T08:10:02.959+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I honestly hope riot does not remove this just because you're typing out a point. \n\nAlso, i've noticed it too. \nYou can be a complete tool (not the word i wanna use but itll do) in the game, and not get punished, but you'll get punished if you tell em to shut up or stop because \"MUH HARRASSMENTZ\"","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Tig3rS1","date":"2019-06-12T13:37:45.094+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey, i just returned to league after a year of not playing, some things never change. i addressed this issue years ago.\njust wanted to tell you, you better remove the names of the players, because when riot sees it they will delete the post and send you a warning for \"shaming\", same thing happened to a similar post of mine.","replies":[{"poster":"Pesquire","date":"2019-06-14T13:24:11.017+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"***","replies":[{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2019-06-14T14:16:12.991+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"There are a multitude of reasons we don't allow public callouts on boards.
