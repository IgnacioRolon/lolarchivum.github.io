Quite often, the first game i play after opening the lol client results in my joining a game 1-2 minutes late. It is out of my control and i am no tech expert that knows how to fix it. As a result, i joined a game just too late and actually watched my nexus blow up due to the leaver remake. I also got five 20 minute time penalties and lost lp. This is absolutely ridiculous. The only reason why im being penalised 20 minutes is because of earlier offences where ive had similar issues where my game would crash or not open after champ select. I have never left a game on purpose or afked on purpose. I feel like im being penalised for something that is out of my control.","replies":[{"poster":"Hailbreather","date":"2016-06-30T20:46:11.886+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"got demoted calibrating my sound setting... afk for less then 2 mins off  of start of game. thanks riot. all this is going 2 do is not let people with crap computers play league,","replies":[{"poster":"Mercenary","date":"2016-07-02T06:15:41.913+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"This is exactly what im talking about.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"RonyStark","date":"2016-06-27T23:53:53.591+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"is the leaver remake system up already?","replies":[{"poster":"Cyrater","date":"2016-06-28T05:23:29.340+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yeah since yesterday I beleive","replies":[{"poster":"Mercenary","date":"2016-06-28T10:03:14.935+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Right when it happens to me, maybe i was the first victim lmao -.-","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Cyrater","date":"2016-06-28T05:24:32.519+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"Yeah well this is an exception, its better one person losing LP than 5 cause of some fault, if it always takes longer to load on the first game why not do a custom or a normals or repair your client or do something.","replies":[{"poster":"Mercenary","date":"2016-06-28T10:01:06.924+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"It doesn't always happen.

The issue lies with how you chose to respond to an issue (an issue you were fully aware of, I might add) that was negatively impacting the game, for other players as well as you.\n\nFACT: You have known about this issue for some time. You stated you've searched for a solution but have had no success, I'm curious if you've tried repairing the client, reinstalling and/or contacting support.\n\nFACT: 1-2 minutes of loading time seems to be inaccurate, as you stated that \"you joined the game to watch your nexus blow up\" (witnessing the Remake taking place) which would only happen if you had spent 3+ minutes loading into the game.\n\nFACT: By your own admission, this is not an uncommon issue. You know the circumstances it occurs under and, yet, do nothing to prevent it from influencing games. It would take all of 5 minutes each time you log on to ensure it has no impact on the experiences of you or anyone else.\n\nFACT: 3 minutes is actually a significant amount of time to be AFK/DCed for, particularly in the early stages of any given match. Given it's a semi-regular occurrence, that's a lot of time you've spent AFK/DCed, and a lot of time where other players would have felt significantly disadvantaged in-game. In fact, it's more than reasonable to assume you've been picked up by the leavebuster system many times already.\n\nFACT: While the circumstances may have been out of your control, your response to those circumstances created a negative experience for other players. You had the means to ensure the issue didn't impact the game and, yet, chose to do nothing, effectively breaking your agreements (TOU and EULA) with Riot.","replies":[{"poster":"fattyhotdogs","date":"2016-06-30T03:11:09.202+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"This.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Mercenary","date":"2016-06-30T11:50:35.128+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"For your information, i do keep up to date with the happenings of the game and you can in no way say that i don't because i unexpectedly came across a new update one night. Keeping up to date is not necessarily something that has to happen immediately mate.  Im also entitled to my own opinion and believe there is an issue with the remake system which ive explained and deem to be unfair. Never has me joining a game a couple mins late negatively impacted those around me and i can say that because ive been in those games and no one has complained or cared at all. Besides up until recently they were all normal games so no one would care. \n\nFACT: The 1-2 minutes was never an absolute exact number but an approximation that could fluctuate on different occasions. So stop making false assumptions. In fact in a later comment i said 2-3 minutes so maybe you should stop making conclusions on exact points and actually confirm or look for clarification because that is not a fact. \n\nFACT: i actually said in another comment that i would not be joining any ranked games during my first game with this knowledge now. So once again you are bloody incorrect in saying that i do nothing to prevent this from influencing other games. Notice i also said that the problem comes and goes. Recently it had not been an issue and suddenly it reappeared. I'd be careful saying any facts over the forum when u know absolute jack all about someone elses experiences besides what you've read. \n\nFACT: It seems you are restating something i said earlier. I said earlier and ill say it again, if u dont want to read the earlier posts then don't comment at all. I stated earlier that i've had common technical issues with the game multiple times. So naturally it is OBVIOUS that i have been picked up by the leaverbuster system many times already. Your point that it creates a negative experience for players is completely subjective and i don't agree with this either, when 1. My problem is a rare occurence and 2. Like i repeated earlier i would always join before 3 mins, or on most occasions within 1-2 minutes. \n\nFACT: You should stop using this \"negative experiences\" as an argument, because it seems that the only person with a negative experience from an issue like this is you. Who are you speaking on behalf of l0000l. Only yourself. You also seem to be contradicting yourself. Earlier you wrote that i had tried to solve the issue and by the end of your comment you're saing that i had been choosing to do nothing and creating a negative experience for players.\n\nBottom line kid. Your assumptions, statements and overall your conclusions are only based on your own preconceived ideas on this subject and you have falsely judged my situation and have included a myriad of false facts within your comment. Please get off if you have nothing positive to contribute.","replies":[{"poster":"Project Xayah","date":"2016-06-30T13:23:48.648+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"> The 1-2 minutes was never an absolute exact number but an approximation that could fluctuate on different occasions.\n\nI never said it was an exact number, just pointing out that it did seem inaccurate based on what *you* have stated.

Doesn't help the people who have already been impacted. Also, *just* for *ranked* games?\n\n> So once again you are bloody incorrect in saying that i do nothing to prevent this from influencing other games.\n\nHave you done anything *before* this point? Not that you've made us aware of. Like I said, it would take all of 5 minutes and the fact that this issue resulted in a *leavebuster punishment* most certainly indicates that you had done nothing until it became a \"real\" issue for *you*.\n\n> Your point that it creates a negative experience for players is completely subjective and i don't agree with this either, when 1.

So, am I to assume you *lied* when you stated that \"*Quite often*, the first game i play after opening the lol client results in my joining a game 1-2 minutes late.\" or are you lying now? It can't be *both* rare and quite often.\n2. Saying \"i would always join before 3 mins\" contradict your earlier statement of \"i joined a game just too late and actually watched my nexus blow up due to the leaver remake.\" so there's literally no reason to have said that. Saying that you would, on most occasions, join within 1-2 minutes is fair enough, however the accuracy of your \"estimates\" was never made clear until now.\n\n> You should stop using this \"negative experiences\" as an argument, because it seems that the only person with a negative experience from an issue like this is you.\n\nYou assume that, because someone says nothing to *you*, that they don't take issue with how you've affected them. FACT: not everyone is going to spend their time explaining it to you. Just because they're quiet doesn't mean they've not been negatively impacted. You *can't* speak for them and, given the general attitude of the player-base, it's more than reasonable to assume that *many* people have been negatively impacted by this issue, even if they've not made that clear to *you personally*.\n\n> Earlier you wrote that i had tried to solve the issue and by the end of your comment you're saing that i had been choosing to do nothing and creating a negative experience for players.\n\nAttempting to solve the issue and preventing the issue from impacting games while searching for a solution are *two different things*. As far as solving the issue is concerned, you seem to have been doing what you can (though I'm not entirely sure how far you've actually gone with this). As far as preventing the issue from impacting games is concerned, there is more than enough to indicate that, up until it became a \"real\" issue for *you*, you had done nothing.\n\nBottom line, you got punished because you weren't taking responsibility for *how you responded to these circumstances*. You *had* the opportunity to minimise your impact but *failed to do so* until it got *you* punished.\n\nThe facts I included in my previous post were based around how the systems work, specific statements within the TOU and EULA and the \"facts\" you chose to share about your experiences taken as face value. If you find issue in those facts, it most likely lies in the \"facts\" you've chosen to share and/or the way you've chosen to share them.","replies":[{"poster":"Mercenary","date":"2016-06-30T14:03:08.178+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"\"I never said it was an exact number, just pointing out that it did seem inaccurate based on what you have stated.

Dont talk crap mate, that's an exact restricted number because you're saying it cant be anything other than 1-2 minutes. \n\n\"That doesn't apply retroactively, though. Doesn't help the people who have already been impacted. Also, just for ranked games?\"\n\nOnce again you're bringing this poor argument that people have been impacted. Leave the nonsense out kid. No one has been impacted negatively by my 1-3 min late joining of games. And stop assuming they have. Only person who has the most accurate judgement of that here is me because i was in those games. Not u buddy, you're just blindly assuming they were. \n\n\"Have you done anything before this point? Not that you've made us aware of.

Like i said earlier buddy, stop making conclusions without any pure evidence other than your own perceived understanding of what you read. It's funny how much you contradict yourself. You acknowledge my efforts to try to fix my technical problems and then you say that somehow it is indicated that i have done nothing. l0000l dude stop wrecking yourself and please do everyone a favour and stay off the forums because you do nothing but exacerbate the issues that other people are genuinely feeling. You are a disgrace to any help or support offered in forums. \n\n\"So, am I to assume you lied when you stated that \"Quite often, the first game i play after opening the lol client results in my joining a game 1-2 minutes late.\" or are you lying now?

The problem is that u assume everything and make up your own false assumptions about people based on what you read. Stop trying to look for flaws in my writing. Even if there were flaws that;s just my own bad explaining not me lying or giving false information. And is it not possible that previously i had always joined before 3 minutes. In fact ill tell you right now that i cannot recall another moment besides that last on in the ranked where i had joined later than 3 minutes. Who are you to judge my past experiences based on a sentence? The accuracy of my statements are completely irrelevant. I don't need to justify the accuracy of my statements to you. Either way i just confirmed what i said was true, so please stop questioning the accuracy of what i provide. I don't need to make my statements clear. The point is that you shouldn't be judging a person based on what you're reading. And yes you were judging, by responding in an uncalled for confrontational tone stating blatant facts which had no relevance to my dilemma.\n\n\"You assume that, because someone says nothing to you, that they don't take issue with how you've affected them. FACT: not everyone is going to spend their time explaining it to you. Just because they're quiet doesn't mean they've not been negatively impacted. You can't speak for them and, given the general attitude of the player-base, it's more than reasonable to assume that many people have been negatively impacted by this issue, even if they've not made that clear to you personally.\"\n\nYes my assumption has a much higher likelihood of being true than yours that everyone is impacted even though you have been in none of my games. Knowing the OCE community, if someone is upset they will bother talking and complain. You are in no position to evaluate the impact of my late joining to game.\n\n\"Attempting to solve the issue and preventing the issue from impacting games while searching for a solution are two different things. As far as solving the issue is concerned, you seem to have been doing what you can (though I'm not entirely sure how far you've actually gone with this).

Exactly, if you're unsure then either ask a question or don't comment at all, because its your false perceptions that brought you here fool. Stop trying to be a hero. You're doing a disservice to the forums with your confrontational responses, and also completely averting from the subject of the thread. Once again you are telling me that i got punished because i didnt take responsibility. This is again false and i have explained why earlier. Opportunity to minimise impact? again this is a false judgement based on absolutely nothing. \n\nBottom line and final line, unless you actually want to help within the forums get off them and do everyone a favour. You are a horrible human being to converse with and you have definitely made my struggle with this issue an even larger issue. If you had any good intentions then you'd understand and stop judging people based on wishy washy things you've read and what you believe to be a generalised case.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Talon12","date":"2016-06-28T01:10:16.721+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"The problem is that if you dc jsut b4 the actual game starts, you can't join until the load screen has finished, so you cant get in without a 1-2 min wait anyway, because solo connecting always takes 200 times bloody longer.","replies":[{"poster":"Mercenary","date":"2016-06-28T09:59:25.344+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"so true :(","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"IndianGamer","date":"2016-06-27T18:15:21.869+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"ik ur feels I am having same issue, but luckly I am not playing rank currently due to low level","replies":[]},{"poster":"Devils Advocate","date":"2016-06-27T22:54:33.479+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"dem feels, Riot will just tell you to suck it up, your hardware should be better, otherwise stop joining games which may affect others results...\n\nin short is what they'll say, maybe more articulated however.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Devils Advocate","date":"2016-06-27T22:56:32.995+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"worst thing is is the 20min wait, then if you go do something to kill the time and miss it, waiting again....\n\nimo; do 5 arams and watch an episode of some show for 15mins at a time","replies":[{"poster":"Mercenary","date":"2016-06-28T10:01:36.150+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Yea i usually just go do something else.
