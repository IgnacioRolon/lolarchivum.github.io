An incredibly shit game to lose on. Was doing well in the early getting kills in top and mid but our adc died once at lvl 2 and proclaimed the game was over. Everytime I looked at bot, our losing botlane was pushing their botlane and getting picked off. They started afking in lanes while abusing teammembers for being \"plat\". Even after I solo stole the first dragon and killed two enemies for nothing, they still remark 'lul plat' and kept saying gg. Thank you for wasting my time. Apparently your time is worth so little. Nice duo botlane. Merry christmas to me.","replies":[{"poster":"Orihalcon","date":"2019-12-24T07:20:33.878+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The jinx finished s9 D4 17lp.
