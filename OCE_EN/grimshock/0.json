I know I&#039;m only a B5 player but I want to get out of Bronze and start getting better matches instead of those toxic players. I know I will always get the toxic players but it would be good to ignore them after the game too. Hoping that it gets fixed in a way that you don&#039;t get your ignored player too.","replies":[{"poster":"Ing√©nue","date":"2016-11-25T06:43:43.049+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"You have the \"block list\" that you can add summoners to so that they are unable to friend request you and are automatically muted if you get into game with them. In the legacy client it is right underneath \"friends list\". You also have the mute button in game.\n\nThe issue with taking players on your block list out of a match of games, is that players can easily abuse this feature. \nDidn't agree with me? **blocked**. \nDidn't win lane/gank/ward where I wanted? **blocked**. \nHad a bad game? **Blocked**. \nIt also would make queue times far greater as the matchmaking became even more complicated. \n\nI tend to block people at the slightest hint of toxicity (I tilt easily) so my block list is pretty big. Due to the times that I play, I usually get the same players for a couple of games straight after another, or even on different days! If I take away all the blocked players on my list from the people playing at 2am, I would likely have to wait a fair while before finding a match. \n\nSimply muting the players before they can type their garbage rants is easy enough, as well as reporting those that engage in other negative behaviours that can't be muted (such as int feeding and rage quitting).","replies":[]},{"poster":"Zorphiax","date":"2016-11-26T13:02:00.437+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I believe you can mute someone in game by typing in chat /mute (player name)","replies":[]}]}
