Why not prevention?","subforum":"Help & Support (OCE)","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I have had this before when the servers or something has gone wrong. I am not sure if it was just my game or everyone but it stuffed up in champion select. I left it for 10 mins and then realised everyone was chatting in champion select but it wasn't doing anything. Then we all quit and when we logged back in it loaded the game. it was 20 mins before the game actually got under way. Well anyway our ezreal never made it back it must of completely stuffed up for him and I was thinking surely this will be a loss prevention because of the server issue but, nope you guys hit me with a loss I couldn't help.","replies":[]}
